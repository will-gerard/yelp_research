My 14 month old son just had his first haircut today and went awesome! Bridgett was patient with him and very friendly. He sat in a police car while watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and only cried a little when the buzzer went on. I will definitely be taking my son there from now on for future haircuts! The price was awesome and the service wonderful. They really are geared towards the little ones!

Went there for lunch with 2 toddlers. We were seated quickly but had terrible service!  We put our orders in for the kids as quickly as possible but she seemed to lack any knowledge of side dishes for them except fries... ok no biggie, we settled with fries. Took her at least ten minutes to come back to grab our orders. Meanwhile my kid, who will eat almost anything, was not interested in the mac n cheese, which I tried and was terrible. When I placed my order I specifically said dressing on side, my salad was drenched in dressing with shredded iceberg lettuce. At this point I didn't have time to send back since the babies were getting restless but of course our waitress was no where to be found so I paid up front. The man up front happened to be the team lead so I told him about how I couldn't really eat the salad and he took 25% off our bill so that was handled well. Also, it was freezing in there!! I mentioned this to the waitress but it never warmed up, thank god I had a sweater for the baby. This is not the coco's I remember years ago. Won't be coming back here again!

I have been coming here for years and never considered it an exceptionally amazing but loved the happy hour and their crazy monkey roll. Well I decided to come here just for that last weekend. It was not busy at all which is very strange as it was prime time on a weekend night and we were seated outside. Let me bottom line it: the food has completely gone downhill and the service is TERRIBLE. Our waiter was nice but seemed kind of new because he would rarely come around to check on us... like 20 minute intervals at least. My husband didn't like his iced green tea so he asked he send it back, he forgot my husband's replacement drink order until we asked again for it. He said he "comped" us for the iced green tea even though we drank hardly any of it and asked for it to be sent back. He never brought us water, I had to walk inside and ask the bartender for water. He forgot the soy sauce and ramekins for our sushi, so my husband had to walk inside and ask for this as well. We're not particularly picky people but when we get a night out we expect basic service.   Now on to the food, I used to LOVE the crazy monkey rolls. I mean I craved them so much it's the reason I went there last weekend. To my disappointment, it was sloppily put together and there was more cream cheese in there than anything. It actually did not even taste good.  Long story short, due to the terrible service and decreasing quality of their food we will not be returning unless it only for happy hour drinks or something. There are far better sushi places in the area with comparable prices, Sakana is amazing for example.

Terrible, terrible food. I asked for the steak salad done medium. Only a very small portion of the steak was cooked properly and there were tons of slimy lettuce leaves. I didn't expect much from this place but it disappointed even more. My husbands fries were undercooked and they ran out of Mac and cheese for my son. The service was kind of weird, not the best and by the end of the night one of the bus boys was sleeping in one of the booths. Only reason we went here was because we were in a rush. Would never come here again except for soda (which was flat) and maybe the dessert.

This is the slowest drive thru I've ever been to, and believe me I go to many starbucks. It takes a good 5 minutes per person every time I've come here. It's truly unbelievable how slow it is. I try not to judge too quickly but the last 3 times I've come here after I pick my son up from school it is the slowest. I literally put my car in park while I'm waiting. I'm never coming here again!

This place is an absolute gem and is set up like a fairy tale. Seating on the patio is a must and one is surrounded with candles and green flora. We had the fixed price menu but they do offer bruschetta and brunch which I'm dying to try. Our meal started with a pear and brie on arugula salad which was perfect. The brie had a little toasting to it which was a nice touch. Then for the main course we had the filet and salmon, both cooked to perfection. Dessert was a nice puff pastry. But what made the experience even more amazing was the service. At the end of our meal we were greeted by the owner, Christian, who was very personable and friendly. He gave us a tour of his kitchen which was adorable. Our waiter, Jeff, chatted with us for a while about travel and food which was awesome. He also recommended Mabel's on Main afterward and we ended our evening on a wonderful high. I would absolutely recommend Cafe Monarch for anyone looking to fall in love or rekindle some passion!

Worst er hospital experience ever, and I'm not one to complain. I have worked in emergency medicine for 7 years and 2 months ago brought my infant in to be seen after having bloody urine and 104.3 fever. We had been discharged from another er the day before and he'd been screaming uncontrollably for 7 hours that day and I was having difficulty controlling his fever. When we got there, There was a long line just to be seen by the nurse, aka get triaged. After 30 minutes of waiting just to get to the front of the triage line the nurse didn't bother to even look me in the eye even though both my son and I were crying at this point. (On a side note, not one child in front of me was crying or in any distress). The nurse showed zero empathy whatsoever. Part of triaging is assessing the sickest children first but I didn't even get a glance for my very sick baby. While I was waiting, I spoke with our pediatrician who advised me to leave considering my son hadn't even had vitals taken after over 30 minutes. When I told the nurse I was leaving she said "well as you can see we're very busy". To which my reply was "I'm not asking to skip the line, only have my baby's vitals taken in a timely matter. What if he has a ruptured appendicitis or something life threatening?". I said "if his vitals are normal I'd be happy to wait like everyone else, I just want him triaged". We finally got the vitals which were relatively normal after I'd dosed him with Motrin and Tylenol. The nurse said it would be probably a 6 hour wait. So we left, and went to his pediatrician who saw us that evening to evaluate us since they were very concerned and we subsequently went to honorhealth Shea.  We got our first bill of $250 on July 5. We disputed it stating we never even saw a provider and were not triaged appropriately, the nurses were very rude and even our pediatrician advised we go elsewhere. The billing lady told my husband she would send it to her manager. Today, we received a bill stating they were sending our "$50" bill to collections. Ummmmmm what?! We've only received one statement which we contested so not sure how that qualifies to go to collections this soon. I will never advise a patient to go there for an emergency. Ever.

My husband has now used A.N.S. twice for a wash/detail service.  Andrew showed up on time and was very pleasant.  Both times, the detail work was fantastic and we couldn't be happier with the results.  The first appointment was specifically done to detail a car that we were trying to sell, and I can guarantee that we probably made money on the wash as we got asking price for the car and nothing but compliments from prospective buyers.  Awesome job!

We have been to Venues multiple times and always had excellent service, drinks and food. We've had some of the same issues as Stephanie D in the prevoius post where we feel we can get subpar service at other restaurants because we're young... not with this place! We would usually go very late and the owner always comes by and chats with us while drinking his own glass of wine. It is a very relaxed and wonderful place. My husband and I are always looking for small, local restaurants and wine places to explore that does not have the usual pretentious Scottsdale crowds. This place has great ambiance without coming off uptight. Plus they have great live music every time we've been there.  I will continue to frequent this place!  Apparently they have Saturday morning car shows and breakfast that my husband is planning on attending as well. I like the fact that they have bottomless house wine specials for $10...sweet!

I've been here twice and both times my problems were with the service. We went there yesterday. When we got there the place was pretty dead yet we had to eventually walk into the bar area to get service to be seated. Ok, no biggie. I asked our server what their "house white" was. He had no clue... went to ask... came back about 5 min later stating no one in the back had any idea and that it was "just a blend"- but of what they have no idea. I'm not a huge wine snob so I ordered a different glass which took about 10 more min for our drinks to come back. Now mind you, the place was dead so not sure why it took so long. After waiting about 30 more minutes after placing our order of a house salad and bruschetta appetizers I inquired about where our food was. He said he just checked and had an issue with the computer so the order was not placed. He was very apologetic which I appreciate but at this point I was pretty irked as he could have noticed this a bit earlier. We placed our credit card on the table (you know the universal sign of you're done and want to leave) and he walked by multiple times without picking it up. Eventually I flagged him down and we got out of there. I see all the great reviews and really want to like this place because it's right near my house but am disappointed every time. I highly doubt I will ever go back to the regular restaurant,  maybe I'll try the happy hour but I'm not too comfortable drinking a wine that no one has any clue as to even what kind of blend it is. *Sigh*

She is amazing and worth every penny! I had a baby only 7 months prior to the shoot and my confidence was very low so I was reluctant to do this. However, I was amazed at how awesome Jodi made me feel and how gorgeous my photos turned out. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to capture their true beauty :)

Desiree is hands down the best newborn care specialist and sleep trainer out there! She sleep trained my first baby in 2012 who was very, very difficult, but with her encouragement and guidance he was sleeping 12 hours a night by 9 weeks. With my second baby I had in January she again guided me and by 5 weeks he was sleeping 12 hours a night. Both my boys are the BEST sleepers and the happiest little guys thanks to her. Both my husband and I are busy professionals so we could not afford to be up all night with crying babies. I do not know what we would have done without her guidance and support with our little ones. I recommend her without reservation! She is very understanding and compassionate as well!

My husband purchased a groupon here and so we decided to have our date night there last night. We have a 1 year old so a date night out is a rarity and we had the best dining experience. The service was the best! I believe the server's name is Sean and he is absolutely wonderful. Very patient and helpful with the menu, also very attentive. 5/5 and more if I could rank the service. Now on to the food: Wonderful! We split the bruschetta with sweet fig, shallot marmalade and proscuitto and they were all wonderful. I had the chef's special of the scallops, they were seared and seasoned to perfection and the seaweed salad was to die for. My husband had the salmon which he also liked. For the wine I couldn't decide on red or white so Sean graciously brought out samples of the legacy white and the malbec. Both wonderful but I ended up going with the legacy. Hubby had a Dogfish IPA which was very smooth. Did I mention they also had live music? And not the booming/"can't hear your own thoughts" kind, but the timeless Spanish guitar and singer. All in all I absolutely plan on coming back here again and again. Great food and service to self-proclaimed foodies... sold.

Went there last week not expecting much as my husband's been there twice and was very disappointed in the quality of the food. The ambience is very modern and cute but I agree with him the food was not good. I had the grilled chicken panini with sweet potato fries. The chicken was terribly dry, there was hardly any sauce and lots of red onions. I could only eat a quarter of it. The sweet potato fries were ok. My friend ordered the steak sandwich which she also said was terrible. I don't plan on coming back here again. Service was pretty good but the food was just abysmal.

Been going here for years and absolutely love it. Very reasonable prices and overall good sushi. Their happy hour is amazing!! If you're looking for a quiet, dependable and cheap place for good sushi this is your place. I usually get the southwest roll (I think), it's the cali roll with sake and avacado on top, absolutely delicious :) Toss it back with some great sake bombers and I'm a happy girl.
