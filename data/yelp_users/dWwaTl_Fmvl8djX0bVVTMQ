Received an email from Malee's listserv today...this location is NOW CLOSED. Owner says it's due to the economy. Main street location is still open.  My heart aches.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. Let me number the ways in which I love this huge, cheap and less-than-normal-smelly Asian market!  1. Meat is cheap. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are 1.99 a pound. Can't beat that. Also, beef tenderloin is 5.99 a pound. Amazing! Shrimp is decently priced and I just recently purchased a crab and steamed him into seafood heaven. So fresh and so tasty. That three pounder was only $19! (Can you tell that I love this place already?)  2. What don't they have? I stock up on the curry pastes and coconut creams when I make Thai, fish sauces and rice noodles when I make Vietnamese, and oyster sauce, wonton skins and everything else when I'm just plain hungry.   3. It's really busy on the weekends, so I go before 11 or during the week. They move pretty quick and I have a 10% discount card--yes, 10% off everything every trip!  4. Produce is wicked cheap and fresh. I love the whole peeled garlic and the baby bok choy. The green beans are yummy and you can't beat the prices on the green and white onions.  BAD NEWS: Word among the Asian community is that LeeLee was recently sold by its Cambodian owner who is opening the location in the West valley. Manila market, which is opening just three miles north, is going to be too tough of competition, especially since Manila's owner is getting his goods from California, which is going to ensure fresher, cheaper products. I love LeeLee, but I might be switching teams is the rumors are true.

I think there are only two things I know--Thai and Vietnamese. In my opinion, I think Swadee was good, but a bit overpriced for what I ordered.  I got the red curry beef, and red curry is the first dish I try to order at Thai places to test their tastiness. I order it 10 stars, or double Thai hot. Yeah, I'm weird, I know. It was very good, but at $10.95, it looked more like the portion I see for lunch everywhere else.  Boyfriend got the beef chow mein, which was a bigger portion and was pretty good. Nothing to yelp about, but he liked it. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit mushy. The plate was huge, and so I figured they made up for my dish with my friend's. I didn't need to eat that much, anyway.  Others got the spicy basil, which got mixed reviews, the panang curry and the spicy basil with eggplant. The latter was really good from the bites I took, while I think the panang was good but not over the top. Another got the thai barbecued chicken, which must have been good because it was almost gone at the end of dinner. It's on fire when they bring it out, so that's fun.   I wanted to rate Swaddee a 3.5, but service was great, so here's a 4. Malee's is still the best on my list, followed by Yupha's and then a tie between Lemongrass and Thai Basil.  Props for being one of the few Thai places in Chandler. Since there are many in my area, I really enjoy living in Tempe. :)

Houston's is evidence that it is better to do a few things really (really, really) well than to do many things in mediocrity.   I had the prime rib French dip and I thought it was amazing until I had a bite of my boyfriend's pork chop and baked potato and my friend's seared ahi. It's all so so good and completely worth the money.   Nice ambiance, and the restaurant is large is keep things (people) moving. We sat in 10 minutes, which sounds like many others who have reviewed herein.

This place is pretty good for being an Italian joint, and I say that because I think that Italian is one of those genres that is best homemade. I tend to think, "I can make better," or "Prego is better than this."  Got the seafood ravioli, which was really good. The pasta with vodka sauce was soupy, but our friend said it was good. Meatballs and Chicken Parmesan dishes looked good. All of the portions are large.   I don't often comment on service, but I wouldn't go here if you're going for a romantic ambiance. Our server was gruff and he said it best when he admitted he came from TGIFriday's. "Are we doing separate checks? If so, I need to know now or I can't do it." He had an I-don't-give-a-crap attitude, which I'm okay with, but I wouldn't want you to go here, get him, and feel like you're in a sports bar.

Canned peas and corn in my soup and curry. No thanks.  Curry was runny and the noodles in my drunken noodles were overcooked and super, super greasy.  I'm disappointed.

I get the skinny on good Vietnamese from my father and he says Maxim is the best when you want Mi, the pork broth soup with egg noodles, wontons, barbeque pork, shrimp and the fixin's. He took me there and he's right. It is the best Mi soup in the Valley, if Dragonfly (in Mesa) doesn't give it some good competition.  I have to be honest and say that I haven't tried anything else, but I can tell you that SO MANY Chinese/Japanese restaurants of Maxim's caliber are really owned and run by Vietnamese. Deb K. is so right on this one--I can attest that the Chinese name and food is there to attract business. The real deal is the Vietnamese soup--the Mi. Those clever Vietnamese...  It's not very pretty, which others have stated, but if you can handle the sub-par cleanliness and decor in exchange for an amazing, albeit cheap bowl of soup, please do. It's definitely a Yelper's kind of place.

underscore the tastiness of the pita bread. so, so good. i was really sad when i realized i had finished my gyro feta pita.  french fries are really, really good. that's probably not why you would come here, but those little bonuses are memorable.  i also had a side salad and the dressing was unlike any greek dressing i've had before-slightly creamy, not to heavy, not too acidic.   yum.  oh, very small dining area so you might want to call them if you've got a larger group.

As most people have said, the wait is long. If you have the time and you're not too hungry, it's worth it. I think that breakfast joints on the weekends tend to be busy, anyway, so I, as impatient as I am, expect a line. Oh, and having the $ is good, too, since their breakfast is slightly more expensive than most.   The omelets are huge (what is that, like 6 eggs?!), and it's nice that they have a huge selection of ingredients to make your own combo. But the Eggs Benedict selection--that's where it's at. Seriously, folks...they have Eggs Benedict with filet mignon. Drool.

Malee's is the most spicy Thai food I've had in the Valley, which is good because it satisfies my really crazy addiction to heat, but it'sbad because most other places just can't live up to the heat standard Malee's has set.  That being said, my new discovery at Malee's is Chef Hot, which is double Thai hot. WOW. Talk about eye-watering satisfaction. I tried it with the crispy basil chicken, but I think next time I'll try it with something that has more of a sauce--like the red curry (Arizona Heatwave).   I've tried the drunken dragon noodles, the aforementioned Arizona heatwave and crispy basil chicken, the roasted duck, the beef-with-some-sort-of-garlic sauce, and the Thai chow mein. My favorite is the crispy basil chicken, but the red curry is the best I've had. It's got a subtle smokiness I just love.  Malee's takes reservations, which is great for the weekends and crowds. I usually for with at least four other people for dinner, so I definitely give Malee's a holler before.  Malee's is a bit more pricey than your average mom-and-pop Thai place, but I think it's worth it every now and then. :)

I struggle a great deal figuring out how many stars to give Four Peaks. If I could give the beer more than five stars, I would, but the actual brewery really drags down their star average.  I love the rustic, no AC feel of Four Peaks. I love going with a big group of people, especially when the weather's just right and it's been a long day. Hello, Kiltlifter.  Speaking of, that is my favorite beer of all time--Kiltlifter, their Scottish-style ale. The 8th St. Pale Ale is also awesome, and their hefeweizen is one of the best I've had.   Food is good, but I don't go there for gourmet. The nachos are huge and the burgers are decent. Again, when drinking, I tend to go for those things which are fried or covered with something awful for me--like processed cheese. I'm not alone in this, right? Hello?  Anyway, the downers: Parking is a nightmare. I'm a creature of convenience who gets frustrated easily when things are not as accessible as I would like. Also, the hostesses up front are just not nice. Seriously. For a while I tried to overcompensate their rudeness with kindness, but to no avail. Now, I just tell them how many people and keep it at that. Servers are alright; that's been a mixed bag and I hope that you get better service than I have.  Good news: Plenty o' bars and pubs have Kiltlifter on tap! Hoorah! Casey Moore's (a favorite of mine), Buffalo Wild Wings (and they're a chain!) and Rula Bula are a few that I can think of off the top of my head. BevMo! also has Four Peaks' beer bottled, which is definitely not as good as the tap or the source, obviously, but when at home, at least it's better than the "great American lager." (Man, are those Budweiser commercials a joke or what?)  In short, go early for parking and a seat and then camp for a while because you know what, everyone else does it and you deserve it. Hello, Kiltlifter...

Do come here if:  1. You want cheap drinks.  2. You want to start happy hour early (4-7 and an amazing 9-close).  3. You want to find a seat easily. Sit at the bar, by the way. The no-bullshit bartender is cool and boyfriend and I had a great time joking with him and talking drinks.  4. You want cheap food. $1.50 edamame and $3-4 rolls and apps during happy hours is unbeatable.  HOWEVER, do not come here if:  1. You want amazing food. I pay for what I get so I'm not terribly dissapointed with how average the sushi is. But when you're drinking, who cares that much, anyway? (I don't.)  Just try it because it's not RA and it's close to campus. I think the RA on Mill smells worse than this place, anyway.

I was so excited to see the Pita Pit had reopened after being booted so ASU can continue its construction frenzy.  I had a gyro pita--authentic, I know. (Not). Friends had the roast beef and chicken crave. They thought they were okay, but I was really disappointed because the pitas were dry and ripped from being rolled. I also remembered the pitas have more in them and being better tasting overall.  I'm hoping that if I visit again, which I'm sure I will with it being across the street, they will have gotten over these grand opening jitters.  Oh, man, I hope so.

You know a restaurant is good when people flock to it despite light rail construction and its screamingly awkward location amongst Planned Parenthood, a tattoo parlor, a bartender school and Filiberto's. The rent must be wicked cheap.  I love the hummus here; both the plain and roasted red pepper are so good. It is the smoothest and most flavorful I've ever had. The Greek salad is good and the pitas are always warm and fresh. I hate a dry pita. Oh, and their passion fruit tea is great.  The chicken shwarma (sp?) pita is my favorite, coming in at a mere $6. They use the same chicken for the pitas as they do the hummus and chicken and chicken on salads. It's "roasted" or something that sounds fancy and appealing. Regardless, it's amazingly juicy and flavorful. Did I just say flavorful again? Indeed.  Since I'm a carnivore, I wish they had an actual gyro on the menu or some other meats besides chicken and fish. I respect their green-ness, so I'll just continue to get my chicken pita.  Parking is a nightmare at lunch, which is the only time I seem to go. With only 30 spots for the aforementioned businesses, the shopping strip can get crazy. Go before noon to secure a position.

And yet another closure. Why are my go-to places losing the battle?  I will miss your patio and cheap, cheap appetizers. Though you weren't all that, and not even the chips, you were always accessible and affordable.  Cheers to you.

Currently being remoldeled and replaced by Thai Rama.  Hope the owners got a good deal. Food was okay, but you hate to see a small mom-and-pop place go.  Here's four stars of optimism that another good Thai place is coming to Tempe.

Being a student, I have to be cheap. But damnit, when you can splurge, it just feels nice. I also uploaded pictures of our entrees.  Boyfriend took me here for my birthday and even though I read it wasn't good, I ordered the Seafood Pistou because it just had a ton of seafood that sounded good (salmon, mussels, clams, tuna, something else I can't remember). You know what this dish needs. SOME CHEAP PASTA. Sounds contradictory for a pricey restaurant with high quality meats, I know, but there was so much garlic pesto in the "shallow broth" that I really wanted some pasta to help soak some of that up. It was good, though.  Boyfriend wanted to "try something new" and rather than taking a small step from meat and potatoes, he ordered the seared tuna. WTF. I ended up eating the tuna because he didn't like the texture (I thought, duh), but he liked the sesame noodles it came with. He ate them while he drooled over the filet on mashed potatoes at the table next to us. NEVER AGAIN, I told him. :)  The salmon cakes were good and I enjoyed the salad they were served on.   I enjoy coming here for lunch because the portions aren't much different for the price, but isn't that the story of lunch v. dinner, anyway?

I think it's important to make a restaurant distinction here. If you appreciate dive-like settings with a) good food and/or b) good service, then you'll like Chuckbox. Oh, also being a meat-eater would help. If you're a sanitation-freak, I wouldn't come here.  Having eaten my lunch too early, I walked across the street from my office to the Chuckbox to give it a try. I stood in line and a nice man behind the grill took my order. A Big One, wheat bun. He then reaches into a bag o' buns and pulls it out with his bare hands, stabs it with burger and cheese identifying toothpicks, and tosses them on a flat grill surface to toast. Then he grabs his spatula and continues to flip.  The burgers move around the heat according to their done-ness, and the chicken goes where the burger was, the pineapple goes where the chicken was....get my point? If it wasn't cooked, maybe some would be worried about cross-contamination.  Anyway, the burger was AWESOME. I thought it was juicy and had good flavor. It looked like he sprinkled season salt on it--I could be wrong. I love a ton of condiments, so I really appreciated having a bar of them to myself. The lettuce was lacking--just a hacked up iceberg with some not so yummy parts, but everything else was what I wanted and more.  This place is all about expectations, and that's why I rambled so much about what some would love and what some would be terrified about.   I'll come back and try the chicken.

great caesar salad, and even though it's $5 to add chicken, the chicken is awesome and they give you five big strips of it.   the so cal love salad is awesome, and so is the fettucine bianca.   they don't offer sandwiches for dinner and the salad portions aren't any bigger for dinner, either (not that they need to be). i'd go here for lunch from now on because it seems to be a better bargain.

I make a trip to the atm just to come to Lee's. You have to eat the bread fresh. Period. It doesn't help any that they come in a paper sleeve...  Secret: Buy in bulk, cut into pieces, and store in ziploc bags. Then, just nuke em for a few second. Good as new.  Enough with the bread. The iced coffee is ridiculous. It is pure espresso and cream. So sweet and strong. Dear lord I love it.  The sandwiches are good. Boyfriend loves the "croissant" side of the menu for the white folks. I'll eat anything, but I do like the bbq pork and grilled chicken sandwiches best.   While you're over there, head to LeeLee supermarket and buy a live crab, some rice noodles, or whatever Asian goodies your heart desires.

Went here for our anniversary with friends. I posted pictures. I apologize that they're half-eaten and upside down, but hey, at least I got a few before we finished the meal. I can't count how many times I've done that.  Had the chicken picatta, which was excellent. Others had the chicken and penne, stroganoff, and ribeye. Prices are a little steep (about 20 bucks on average), but they are typical for a resort restaurant. Excellent service--she even cracked a joke (on me!).  The lounge area is great and the bartenders enjoyable. We went to the lounge bar before dinner and for a night cap every night we stayed at the Ho.  Highly recommend.

I'm a mainstream dum sum eater, so I'm not going to pretend I know anything about tripe, chicken feet, or any other hardcore dim sum dishes. Hell, I've lived in Phoenix my entire life, so I may not know anything about dim sum in general.  BUT, I do know that there are five key dishes that make dim sum good for me: shumai, shrimp dumplings, meat and rice in banana leaves, shrimp or beef in rice sheets with that yummy sauce, and bbq pork buns. See, I don't even know the names.  All of the above were excellent and China King is not so big that it takes a half hour for the shumai to make its way around only to find out the cart is empty. I really hate that.   Boyfriend and I stuffed ourselves for $28.   They were a buffet last time I was here a few years ago, but we were pleasantly surprised to see they went into the dim sum-and-swimming-fishes business. Tastes way better, in my opinion.

Here is a great example of why I can't seem to lose weight...  Great beer and awesome food.  Calamari was good--tasted like anywhere else.  BUT the mac n cheese is the real deal. Boyfriend and I split it and it was more than enough for both of us. Rich, delicious heaven with roasted chicken, mushrooms and bacon pieces in it.  Service is okay...one of those places where the server takes your orders but doesn't deliver the goods. It's fine, just seems like they're held less accountable for good service.

I am the antithesis of a vegetarian, but I tried their falafel today and it is AMAZING. Such great flavor. I agree with others that it is a bit dry, but the accompanying sauce does the trick. And that garlic sauce--whoa, I'm definitely not getting any love any time soon.  I also tried the "hommus deluxe" with chicken today. That's the creamiest hummus I've ever had. Wow, so flavorful and the chicken was grilled perfectly. My girlfriend and I shared and still had extra falafel and hummus.   I usually get a gyro pita boat. I've never had a gyro with so much meat...a definite plus for me. Wait, I lie, the chicken schwarma at Pita Jungle is comparable in size and filling. Maybe I'll go there tomorrow.  Back to the matter at hand. This place is mighty tasty and cheap to boot. The service, in my experience, has always been good, if not great.   And for being so close to Mill, you have to try this place because it a) isn't a chain, b) doesn't smell like sewer, and c) isn't consistently packed and loud.

So good! I had the chicken alfredo pasty and boyfriend had the bangers and mash. I'll never eat a Hot Pocket again! Happy hour is only 3-5, so get there early and enjoy a dollar off beers (not sure if this is drafts and/or bottles).  The place is small...and I'm all about cozy establishments, but when it smells nasty and the bathroom feels like an outhouse, I'm getting take out in the future.

My friends and I eat Thai for lunch about once every two weeks, sometimes more. That being said, I've been around a fair amount of Thai restaurants in and around Tempe and Yupha's is second to Malee's on my list (first when the budget is tight! He ;) ).   A few other quick notes:  Double Thai hot, we've discovered, is just hot enough.   Yupha's is busy at lunch, but not impossible like Thai Basil.  Service is good, but a little slow when they're busy. The two seem to correlate anywhere, so I don't let this one bug me too much.  I've tried the pad thai and the pad gra pow. Both are excellent.   Servings are good-sized.   If you like Thai, put this one on your list.  Amen.

The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize.  The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.  I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so.   Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.  EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.

Stay away. If you're yuppy (yeah, that's you) and/or a "tradiitonal" college student (yeah, that's your friend), then you won't feel quite right here. This isn't your Zuma/Cue Club/RA crowd by any means. I'll admit we asked if they had wine. Silly, silly yuppies.  Drinks are nasty. And they all come in pint glasses. Cherry vodka drink was cheap, but god knows what the hell was in it. What was I thinking.   I didn't pay for the dancers so I can understand why they're two shades from kind of attractive. But they are tacky. I think it's more fun to get drunk girls up there to dance.   But I did have fun dancing with friends in our own little circle of death. I suppose it is what you make of it.   Drink beforehand.

People must come here for the owners or the pizza, because what we experienced last night was just mediocre.  The penne in cream sauce was just plain. Presentation was bleah. Caesar was okay. Chicken was dry and there was a bit too much dressing.  If you want romantic and quaint, this isn't it. Think pizza joint with slightly better decorations.  I would say if you're in the area, go to VinciTorio's. We seemed to be the only non-regulars, so I must be missing something. Probably will not return.

Great steak, amazing potatoes, very attentive service. Boyfriend and I both had the ribeye, wings, and a few drinks a piece. Bill with tip was a bit over $100--not bad!   Seems that others have had issue with the doneness of their steaks. I didn't have a problem. And I think steak doneness is a tough one. Oh well.  I didn't see any reviews about the bread. OMG. It is amazing--crusty on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside. But this is a grill, folks, so go for the steak (but you'll talk about the bread, trust me).

I love wings, and I especially like them crispy so the skin is worth eating. Their wings...not so crispy and too fatty. Good flavor, but fatty.  Hummus is one of my favorites, but their hummus had so much garlic in it that I'm still breathing garlic fire this morning after brushing twice and using a ton of mouthwash. Beware, it's one of those "oh, but you taste so good. oh, but I know I shouldn't." And you do it anyway.  Their pizza is good. We had the shrimp and bacon, and the pepperoni, sausage and peppers pizzas. They ran out of bacon, which was a bummer because you could tell something was missing. And who runs out of bacon when it's on quite a few of their specialty pizzas? The other pizza was good, all of the peppers and onions made it sweeter and I wish the sausage and pepperoni would have added some spicy/saltiness to the pizza to balance that out. Great crust. Super tasty, slightly crispy, slightly chewy.  Happy hour is great, so I can't complain about how cheap it was last night.

Tuesdays are all night happy hours (when one ends, the reverse begins), and Mondays and Thursdays after 6:30 they have a collection of 1/2 off rolls.  Can't speak too much for the drink specials because I always get their signature saketini, which is made with absolut and some green tea liqeuor. I highly recommend this drink because it's smooth, slightly sweet, and has that nice green tea flavor I just love.  We're pretty boring when it comes to rolls--got the crispy california, the shrimp tempura and the firecracker, which was a jumbo jalepeno popper with spicy crab in it. Oh man, it was all glorious. I've had the spicy tuna there also, and the dragon. It's all good to me.  They always have some crazy creation on the sushi board and the staff is always friendly. You're better off sitting at the bar--we go for games--as it seems the servers are more attentive there (or at least they're always back there doing stuff).  Try it, and keep a business alive.

I preface this by stating I am half Vietnamese and almost every weekend I have Pho at my father's home. Nothing beats a homemade bowl of this beautiful broth, and I must admit that because I am spoiled with authenticity I tend to be a harsher critic.  At the same time, however, I do give most Vietnamese restaurants some slack. If you want good Pho, do not go to Dragonfly in Tempe. Please, please, please. Their bowl of Pho is incredibly small and they skimp majorly on the aromatics. Talk about a Pho foul. And what's with the shredded roast-like meat? Oh no, it's supposed to be circle wafers of rare beef.   Instead, visit the Dragonfly in Mesa. That place rocks, and they have other authentic soups that the Tempe location does not have. Like the great soup, "mi"--that's egg-noodle-wonton heaven. The egg rolls are not good at either location, by the way. If you know the difference between Vietnamese "egg rolls" or chai gois, and the fat, cabbage filled Chinese egg roll, then you can imagine how disappointed I was when they brought me some egg roll hybrid with a gross sweet and sour sauce.   I'm glad to see a Vietnamese place on campus, regardless. And if others love it, more power to them and I hope it keeps good little ethnic places like Dragonfly open. Just know that there is way better out there!

First, the service here is wonderful. Since I am realizing now more than ever how much I'm in the "know" when it comes to the Vietnamese community, I can say that this place is way up there on the service. And um, we know how service can be at your typical Asian establishment (just read other reviews).  What to order, eh? The pho is good, but not the best. I order it because I can't make it myself. The bun soup is also good, especially the shrimp-laden variety. A little shrimp paste goes a LONG way. I like to nibble on grandma's because she can eat most of the bowl and I tend to get tired of the bun.   The lemongrass chicken is the best in the Valley, according to my sister and I. It is a dry stir-fried dish, which I appreciate because isn't it easier to add a goopy garlic sauce and call it a dish? I think so, so I appreciate that they cook the sugar just past caramelized but before burnt, sautee the chicken in it and add soy, garlic, lemongrass and chili. It's all preference, I suppose.  The cha gio (egg rolls) are some of the best I've had, though at $5 for two, I'm wondering why the soup is relatively cheap?   An overall good experience.

I went here once for lunch and was really disappointed. Boyfriend and I shared the fajitas, which were $18. The iron skillet on which it was served was incredibly small and I think we got three skimpy tacos out of it. They tasted okay--Chili's fajitas are better, I think. The margaritas are okay, a bit too much mixer and not as smooth as I like.  I think $4 for a Corona is a a bit much when you're a Mexican inspired Cantina, but then again, maybe as a lunch customer they were making money off of us in exchange for this awesome happy hour I hear about.   Speaking of,  I'd give this place another shot if it was during happy hour. It is loud and packed when I pass by it, so I wonder if they'd have room? Take this review with a grain of salt--I think my expectations are misaligned for the location and the patrons.

The short version: good sushi, decent prices, decent service, decent atmosphere.  Of all of the sushi places in Tempe to visit, this is the best to go to with a group, as we often do. Compared to some other choices (Sushi101=small, cramped, poor quality; RA=dirty, smelly, loud), it seems to be the best in our book.  The service is okay. No one smiling or seemingly excited about their lives, but they keep the beverages coming.  The sushi is good. I admit I'm a roll fan, so take what I say with a grain of salt. The rolls bigger than most and I personally like the rose, the philly, the lotus, the lotus on fire, the dragon, and variations of the california roll (topped with scallops, lobster, deep fried, etc.).   I give them four stars because I frequent here with the work crowd and we like it enough to come back.

I'm sitting at Solo right now with a friend, each of us working on our own projects.   I love this place. Great coffee, all local.   Also, a great place to work--relaxing, not too busy, and pretty quiet. I'm a coffee-camper, so this is the place for me!  On a side, but no less important note, I think it's really incredible that wife's hair salon and husband's coffee shop are connected. What a great family experience!

Good pho is usually a trade-off: good soup for a less-than-desirable atmosphere. OR, what's worse, a  "cool" place for crappy, msg-laden pho.  Pho Ao Sen manages to deliver both great pho and a clean, trendy atmosphere. The pho is flavorful, the toppings (bean sprouts, mint, basil, etc.) are fresh, and the meat is quality. These things sound trivial but most places f it up pretty consistently.  Have I gone to heaven? I dunno, but I'm going back there tomorrow!

Yuck.   Pho is rather tasteless, there is no pho-fragrance, and they use the wrong noodles. It's pho, not pad thai.  Stir fries use anti-fresh vegetables and if it doesn't come out of a can, they don't use it.  Stay away from here.   I will, however, be returning because Grandma thinks this place is amazing, and I really think it's because of the owner. He's from the Motherland and she just loves that. It doesn't mean he can cook the food well, but sometimes we just suck it up and go along for the people we love (and the people they love, too).

When the service picks up, they will be better than Thai Basil--not in flavor or quality, but they have WAY more seating.  Menu (at least for lunch) has more variety than Thai Basil.  Nice decor, good portions, $7 for lunch.  The fourth star is conditional on service improvement.
