Jager, my 6 year old bull terrier, has been seeing Dr. Allen since he was 10 weeks old. She is nothing short of wonderful. In fact, the entire staff is comprised of the most compassionate people I've ever met, and they truly care about my dog. Over his 6 years, mischievous Jager has gotten himself into some pretty precarious situations (run-ins with cacti, frolicking in broken glass and, of course,  attempting to digest shoes and socks). The folks at Indian Bend Animal Hospital always make him good as new, with as little pain (and expense) as possible. The cost is much more reasonable than other similar facilities in the area. As a full-time working single [dog] parent, I really appreciate that they are open on Wednesdays from 4pm to 8 pm. Dr. Allen has always been patient, even with an annoying first-time dog owner such as myself. I can't imagine trusting his care to anyone else.

Went here Saturday night with a group of about a dozen girls for a bachelorette party. The crowd was thin when we arrived at 9:30, but it was still a bit early for the full-fledged drinking crowd. The cocktail waitresses were friendly and attentive, and were somehow able to keep the liquor steadily flowing throughout the night. They suggested a drink called "The Grotto" which was a huge sea-blue concoction consisting mostly of various types of flavored rums and floating fruit, served in a giant plastic clam shell with multiple straws for sharing. This was perfect for our group, and at any given time, half a dozen girls would be slurping from the giant clam all night (yeah, that joke was made more times than I'd care to admit).  The music was fun and there was a good mix of people. We sat outside on the couches for most of the night, and there seemed to be plenty of room the entire time. Now, inside...that's a different story...after about 11:00 pm, the music is way too loud to communicate with anyone and it can be very difficult to weasel into the bar and get a drink. If you're lucky enough to score some prime real estate at the bar, the bartenders are great and the drinks are strong - even the super girly ones.

I dig it. It reminds me of restaurants I would frequent back home in San Francisco. I found it to be a very cool spot with friendly, efficient bartenders and servers, diverse (yet relevant) menu and handsome architecture. I love the open airy-ness about the restaurant and the combination indoor-outdoor bar area.  The brick oven is impressive, the wines are exciting and the food is phenomenal.  Everything is very reasonably priced, including drinks.  Parking is valet-only, but it's complimentary. St. Francis is the perfect place for drinking wine with friends, and has definitely been added to my happy hour rotation.  It also strikes me as a great "date" spot. Not that I'm in any danger of needing to be concerned about that.   For as cool as this spot is, nobody there seems to be up their own a$$ about it. The ever-increasing cloud of smug I've noticed in Phoenix has definitely passed over St. Francis.

I have been going to a genius stylist for about 5 years now, but she's been traveling so much recently that I was forced to see someone new for my last appointment.  I've driven past Etch at Kierland Commons dozens of times, and have recently had a couple of friends try them out with fairly decent results. I prefer to have my hair colored and cut by the same person, and they were happy to accommodate. However, I believe that they normally schedule a separate stylist, colorist, assistant, etc.  My appointment was with Janine, who had her work cut out for her when I went in - my hair was about 8 inches longer than it needed to be and my roots had started taking over. I was a little nervous to have my long hair cut drastically short by someone I hadn't been to before, but she did a fantastic job, and did so with very little instruction/guidance. The color was perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better cut. I really enjoyed the salon. It is clean, edgy and appears to have all of the latest and greatest hair styling toys. The entire experience ran me $170, which is more than i typically pay, but I think it is a competitive price for the area. The salon is open late and on weekends, which is very convenient. I will definitely return.  **I should also mention that another friend of mine, Fuzzy (called that because of his fuzzy hair), who has had his hair cut by the same barber since he was 6 years old, was recently given an extreme-hair-makeover by Ryan.  Ryan not only proved his genius status by seriously updating his look, but was very friendly along the way and patiently showed Fuzzy how to keep up his style after he left the salon. Great experiences all-around.

Went to Maizie's with a friend en route to find my car on Sunday "morning" about 1pm, and it was everything my hangover could've wanted and more. I normally try to steer clear of central Phoenix, but I would go back here in a heartbeat. They had me at "$3 bloody mary's and mimosas All Day."  Naturally, I indulged in both and, from what I remember, they were fantastic. Brunch menu was a perfect blend of healthy and comfort food.  I opted for comfort food, which included the most perfect of all hangover remedies - tots. Tots + champagne cocktail = euphoria. We sat on the patio, which provided the perfect setting to relive the night's entertaining events. The service was excellent, and there are even a couple of resident dogs to provide some entertainment. Even though the drink specials were too good to pass up, and my car had to sleepover in the lonely parking lot another night, it was well worth it.

Best spa experience I've ever had, without a doubt.  I've been to a dozen spas out here, but I've never seen any reason to write about any one of them. First off - best massage of my life. I've recently started training for a marathon, so the stretching included with the Signature massage was absolutely perfect. Not so much that I felt like I was exercising (that would defeat my purpose), but just enough to make my sore muscles melt. The facilities at the Montelucia are amazing. I really love the Moroccan theme - unique and vibrant, yet as serene as it should be. Everything is clean and new and it smells delicious.  I LOVE the idea of the "whisper room" - a dimly lit space with loung-y beds, especially after a couple of pitchers of sangria out by the pool. I see Camelback Mountain everyday, yet the view from the terrace was breathtaking. My friend and I lounged outside for hours eating and sipping cocktails by the 85-degree heated pool.   The only drawback is that it ain't cheap, even with the "local" discount. Even though my spa day cost me more than the monthly payment on my BMW, I can't wait to go back. Perhaps after I find a second job.

Went here very late Friday night after picking up a friend from the airport in town from SF. We sat on the patio, but I noticed the interior was v. cool and the bar was massive. Although we were here for late dinner, I can't wait to go back for happy hour sometime. The margaritas were incredible - I tried the blood orange and my friend had some kind of pomegranate-something-something. They were both fantastic, and the tequila list was strong which is a big plus in my book. The drink list was refreshingly innovative and unique. Even the chips and salsa are worthy of mention. It's been a while since I've had guac near as tasty as at Blanco. We both had different varieties of tacos which I thought were outstanding. I usually consider the accompanying rice and beans as filler which I almost always pass over to save room for more booze, but not this time. The only complaint I had was the patio seating wasn't very good for eating - great for drinks and socializing, but we were posed in a constant hunch the entire time as we sucked down our food.  The patio seating does have couches and comfy chairs which are perfect for the happy hour setting. The place also seems to attract a fun, vibrant crowd. It probably goes without saying, as I'm certain I'm the only r'tard who would choose to eat outdoors in Scottsdale right now, but definitely eat at the bar or the in the dining room.

At first glance, the bar itself is simple, spacious and not terribly offensive. Early in the evening, it wasn't bad - can't really F-up a Coors Light, right? The music was fun and people seemed to be having a good time.  The crowd, on the other hand, consisted of a horde of ill-mannered college dropouts with a sprinkling of men in their mid-30s who are clearly in denial about the last decade (I saw puka shells. I'm not kidding).   The cloud of pretension was thick and completely unwarranted.  Reminded me of a pompous version of Senor Frogs. Not for me.

I met a couple of friends here Friday night. I tolerated it for about an hour. It's not often I walk into a bar and feel young anymore, but since the crowd seemed to be mostly in the mid-40's to mid 50's range, I felt like a fetus. The drinks were good, and our waitress was friendly. The live band was ok, but the set list was taken directly from the Wedding Singer soundtrack. Now, I'm no beauty queen, but I've never seen a bigger bunch of unattractive, scantily clad, over-tanned, retirement aged people in one room in my life. I felt like a guest at the third wedding of my 55 year old uncle somewhere near the Jersey Shore. Not for me.

I've been here for brunch 3 times now, and it only gets better. The unlimited champagne is a requirement for brunch, but it actually tastes good. Most unlimited champagne brunches end up making me sick because the bubbly is vile....not this one. The food is amazing, the service is fantastic. The patio is great, with a live band and everything. Last time i was there, we sat for hours enjoying the atmosphere (and drinking champange, of course).

I met a couple of friends here Sunday morning (by that I mean noon - don't judge me) for breakfast. I have been searching high and low for a place to finally catch on to the bacon bloody mary craze, and I heard this was the right spot. I expected a crowd, but there was plenty of parking and plenty of seating available. I became skeptical, and rightfully so. I was not at all impressed by the boring 1985 country-kitchen décor, which included grandma-powder-blue diner booths and a few rogue tables in unfortunate positions. The walls were "decorated" with nothing more than dozens of identical empty ketchup cans and a couple of oddly placed flat screens. The food was disappointing, at best. I'm not sure how they managed to ruin simple potatoes, but I'm fairly sure it was intentional. They were hard round disks that appeared to have been soaked in some kind of onion-oily substance, and tasted nothing short of old. The bacon-bloody was equally as disappointing. It was mediocre in flavor and had relatively no kick = pointless. The only thing bacon-y about it was a skewered piece of chewy bacon climbing out the top - good for display, but perhaps they should consider cooking it first or maybe working the flavor into the drink. In fact, I didn't really see anything bacon-y about this place. It's a shame because there really is a lot of potential here -great location, open and spacious layout, a full bar (which is v. important in any breakfast joint), etc.   I'm giving the stars for the decent, friendly service and the availability to get a table at any time. I typically judge my breakfast experiences by how helpful they are in relieving my hangovers. I was hoping for a fun, lively environment coupled with a little hair-o'-the-dog, in which my friends tell me about the good times I had the night before (because i can't remember). Sadly, Bacon didn't come through for me.

This is a review of the pool only. Went to the pool over Memorial Day holiday and it was awful. I arrived at 9:00 am Sunday morning, and it was already packed. Thankfully, my friend who was staying there arrived at 7:30 am to get the last 2 open lounge chairs. The pool is very small in relation to some of the other newer resorts in the area. Normally, I like a crowded and bustling pool scene, but when the crowd consists of 75% children squirting their water guns my direction, I'll pass. The bar didn't open until 11am, which doesn't score them any points, either, especially considering that I had to put up with 100+ screaming 8 year olds ruining my tan. As the day progressed and the sun intensified, my friend asked for an umbrella no fewer than 3 times before getting someone to move one her direction. This would have been expected, except that there was a closed umbrella about 15 feet away from her that simply needed to be transplanted into the stand nearby. The food wasn't bad at all, and the drinks were tolerable...when we were finally able to flag down a waitress sometime around noon. A little music might have helped, too. Sadly, the Biltmore seems long overdue for an update.

Scottsdale needed this.   I went here for happy hour on Friday night and absolutely loved it.  I was close on the heels of Cyrus M., who had left just before I pulled up. He insisted that I have the bartender make me a Manhattan, the best he claimed to have ever imbibed. I listened, and Cyrus was 100% right.  One of the bartenders also demonstrated his technique by executing a perfect Sazerac. I have to admit, I wouldn't know if it was less than perfect because there isn't another bartender in the Phoenix metro area (that I'm aware of) who would brave the task of creating such a masterpiece. At any rate, it was delicious. These guys know what they're doing. At the same time, I haven't met a more friendly, less pretentious group of bartenders in that area in a very long time, if ever.  Unfortunately, I wasn't there long enough to eat, which is why I will be returning next weekend. And I can't wait.   The decor is unique and interesting. The lounge is just dark enough to be mysterious, but without being annoying. The furniture is ornate and definitely reminiscent of the bygone "speakeasy" era, complete with an entire room accessed only through a bookshelf.  It's been a while since something this distinctive has graced the Scottsdale scene. I found my new favorite bar.

This review is loooong overdue. On what seemed to be a never-ending search for the perfect 'do last summer, I discovered Dionna and Salon Embellish. Actually, I didn't just happen upon it, about 12 of my closest friends also go to Salon Embellish, and I'm proud to say they are the 12 most beautiful girls with the most beautiful hair that I know.  It's an Aveda salon, so everything inside smells pretty and fresh, and I'm always supplied with the best products. My very blonde hair can be difficult to lighten properly, but not for Dionna. It's perfect every time. She always knows how I want it cut, even if I don't. My biggest fear is (was) to leave a salon looking out-dated, but I am perfectly comfortable knowing Dionna would never let that happen. The salon has everything I could ever want - massage, body and facial treatments, etc. I could spend all weekend there. Everyone is friendly and fun, the prices are Very reasonable, and there are plenty of weekend appointments. I'm happy to say that my stylist search has come to an end.

I went last year and had a blast. This year, not so much. I bought general admission and tequila tent tix online for myself and an out of town friend so we could avoid lines and the hassle of buying them there. No hassle avoided. The people at the entrance were so confused that it took at least 20 minutes for us to finally enter the festival, and there was no line at the time. We had to stop at two separate tables to finally get actual entry tickets in exchange for our online tix. Even though we bought our tequila tent tix in advance, we were told that they ran out of bracelets - and the bracelets had removable tabs for tequila samples. They unapologetically provided us with makeshift entry tickets, which were not accepted without a heated discussion with the carnies manning the line outside the entry to the tequila tent. Unfortunately, no amount of tacos or tequila could compensate for the poor organization and hostile event workers.
