This tiny little bar in Heritage Square is adjacent to Pizzeria Bianco and is the perfect compliment to the sometimes insurmountable wait at the pizza joint.   A date and I were there for about an hour and half while waiting for our table next door. Everyone describes it as tiny and they are right. The bar itself is immediately to the right in a very small room. So after ordering a drink for each of us we ventured into the rest of the "house". It opened up a bit more and we found a seat along some of the windows on a padded bench. After finishing our first round a waitress came over fairly quickly and asked if we needed anything else. More drinks and a plate of prosciutto and another round were ordered. By this time we were able to move to a large wooden table that had become vacant.   The food came out and it was perfect. Buttery crostini and paper thin prosciutto. Perfect amount of food to wet your appetite. The atmosphere inside the bar was very laid back and soothing. The prices weren't too bad either. 4 drinks and an app came to $20. Not too bad I thought. This would be a great place to go hang out on any night and not have to worry about a table next door. Our Bar Bianco experience ended when they came and got us for our table. Those nice little touches of not having to run over to make sure you didn't get skipped are great. It allows to just enjoy your wait.   Go hit this place up. Again, it is another impressive place.

The post-party for the Switch OYE was here. Even if there were only 8 of us. We came just in time for trivia night. Which is apparently a big deal here. I LOVE trivia with useless factoids, so I felt right at home. 40 questions really tries the useless knowledge portion of the brain. Which in my case is most of it. Unfortunately I was already a little sauced and was 3 more beers deep by the time we were done. It was a great time, including war paint. We scored 28 out of 40. I am going back soon to redeem myself. Georgie S, are you down?  We also created a new game that works when Nikki F is there.  If she starts to fall asleep, someone says her name and then rest of the table, in unison, must yell her name again.  Good clean fun!  I like the decor. There are authentic European football jerseys and scarves all over the place. Rugby too.   A couple of side notes. 1 star deduction for, what I am guessing was a manager, coming over and telling us we were being too loud and disruptive. WTF?!!! We are in an English pub, with a lot of beer, drunk people, playing a competitive trivia game. Are you serious!? I was dumb founded and I think I may have talked back to this dude. Couldn't believe it.   I have started my "Slay the Dragon" card. Only 61 more beers to earn my shirt. Starting to train now.   Sorry for the pic post Nathan S, I had too.

I would give 3.5 stars, but can't so I am giving the Bacchanal 4 stars. I recently tried this place out while at a birthday dinner for a hockey buddy. There were 12 of us sitting at a U-shaped table, which was nice since everyone could talk to everyone. Well, we could if we weren't right next to the band, but oh well.   I think the appeal for this place is definitely the atmosphere. It is almost like a show where they serve food and alcohol, as opposed to a restaurant. There is one older Greek dude with two lazy eyes who kind of MC's the "event". You can really only understand every fourth word he says, but at least it is somewhat authentic. The band was good, with a rag-tag group of Greek gentleman. Although the drummer reminded me of Big Pussy from the Sopranos. A belly dancer came out and fell in love with my buddy Peter. He was in love too, I think. You also get to throw ceramic plates onto the dance floor and yell OPA!   The food was decent, nothing spectacular. I had a baked Halibut fillet with a lemon bechemel sauce. It came with potatoes and vegetables. The veggies were a little disappointing. They obviously weren't fresh, most likely canned. We did try the calamari, which was good. They have Stella! This made me happy.   Overall the party had a great time, but I don't think anyone was blown away by the food. The same strange lazy-eyed Greek gentleman shook everyones hand on the way out. That was nice, but I ended up smelling like whatever cologne he had just taken a bath in.

I will admit, had it not been for Triple D on Food Network, I probably wouldn't have heard of this place. I am glad I am an avid viewer of this channel. My father, being the martyr that he is, decided he didn't want to go to dinner for his 55th birthday. So after some hemming and hawing, I bullied him into it. The next question, Where do we go? I told him about this recent episode of Triple D and to my amazement he had seen it to and suddenly he was all happy about a birthday dinner.   Like most places nowadays, they don't take reservations. My brother called ahead and was told it should be fine for our time for a table of 8, a Wednesday night mind you. We were seated and take everyone else's word if not mine, the restaurant is small(read:TINY). There are probably 12 tables, max. We were given menus quickly and had our drink orders taken and brought out promptly. The table started with a mixed bruschetta of a traditional tomato and basil and a pesto with tomato. Both were excellent. They have a bunch of other choices as well. We also had the caprese salad, fresh balls of mozzarella, tomatoes, and romaine covered in balsamic vinegar. This too was great.   Dinner choices were varied. I had a fettuccine with chicken, green chilies, and sun dried tomato. It had a garlic-wine sauce. Sprinkle on a little red pepper flakes for a little extra heat and you'll be happy. Get the fresh pasta, pay the extra buck, and you'll be one smiling mother#$*&er! Fresh pasta makes a world of difference. I sampled everything at the table. The macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, the ravioli, and the penne with sausage. The regular plain old red pasta sauce they use is great! It had such a nice sweetness to it I could have had a bowl of it.  Get the mac & cheese.  It is baked to perfection!  We aren't talking Kraft mac and cheese here either people.  This has real cheese, not some powder cheese.  We also indulged in dessert and coffee. The flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato was delicious. The cappuccino was great too. I was told the key lime cheesecake was good as well.   The dining experience was nice. I thought the prices were reasonable and the serving size ample. We spoke with the owner, Richard, for long stretches throughout the meal and he was very personable and answered any questions or gave suggestions on meals. He saw me taking a picture of my food and asked if this was going to be on Yelp! I assured him it would be. He told me I wasn't getting anything free because of it, with a smile and a laugh. Love the NY attitude.   For those that gave a bad review, I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. NO other Italian restaurants in the valley use fresh pasta, maybe Pasta Brioni. So, if you thought Buca, Olive Garden(barf), or Macaroni Grill used it, you are sadly mistaken.

Last night I made my second trip to Postino and was in the company of a very lovely young woman. Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber!   The parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her.   Our server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good.   For the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it.   Unfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect.   Again, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!

I have been coming to Silver Touch since I have been driving. It used to be a Weiss Guys, but was bought out by another member of the family. Everytime I have brought a vehicle here they have done a great job. They offer many services and options for your individual needs. The prices are reasonable and they offer a discount if you come back in a week. With the monsoon season upon us this could come in handy. I drive the 15 minutes to get my car washed here. It's what I know. Maybe I'm afraid of change?

So there is not much difference from one to the other, but what the hell.  This is the closest one to me and is on the way to work.  I will stop by on occasion to grab a quick smoothie before work.  They are consistent each and every time I go in.  The kids that work there are actually friendly and personable.  Unlike a lot of places that hire the younger people in the workforce.  This place is OK with me.  The parking lot leaves a little to be desired.  You can only go right or you can wait an interminable amount of time to go left out of the other entrance/exit.  You will also be risking your life by doing so.

Have you ever had a day, where you just didn't want to get out of bed at all?  I mean not even to go to the bathroom?  Well, if you are anything like Mr. Dallas G, you may ask, what could implore you to stay in bed all day?  Well Mr. G, the company of a lovely woman was number one on my list on this particular Saturday.    At about 1:30 in the afternoon, we both started to get ravenous.  I had been having cravings for Chinese food since about 11 PM the previous night.  My lovely bed mate suggested Go Go China.  I had never eaten here before and am a little reluctant to branch out from my usual go to Chinese place.  Once the stunning sack-mate informed me that they deliver and I would not have to leave the bed, I was sold.  She even went downstairs and got the menu! Goddess material, right?  We perused the menu and made our decisions.  I had the task of calling in the order.  A man answered and it was barely discernible what language they were speaking.  After inquiring about placing an order for delivery I was told that they would call back in exactly 6 minutes.  I began to question this, but the other line had already gone dead.  So, we waited the 6 minutes and by golly the phone rang.  I ask to place the order, but am first bombarded with what seems like a CIA inquiry.  After passing the interrogation I am finally allowed to place the order.  Sesame Chicken lunch special for me, which included wonton soup and pork fried rice, and Chicken Lo Mein with chicken fried rice and a pork egg roll.  We also got a shrimp egg roll.  I was worried when they quoted a 45-60 minute wait for delivery.  So, when the food arrived in 20 minutes I was ecstatic.  The beautiful woman next to me went downstairs to retrieve the food and everything.  From atop Mount Olympus she must have come.  The wonton soup was really good, the fried rice was really good,  the Sesame chicken was really good, and the egg roll was really good.  The ravishing Ms. M next to me said all of her food was really good too. Overall, the food was really good.  The best part, aside from being in a bed with a gorgeous woman, eating Chinese food, and not really worrying about anything, the total with delivery and tip was only $21!  To this half-breed Jew, that is the silver lining my friends.     If you find yourself stuck to your mattress and are in need of some sustenance, call Go Go China, wait 6 minutes for a call back and get it delivered.  They truly did.

I share Tim's sentiments about Behind the Mask.  In a hockey store starved town, BTM could really rake you over the coals for their inventory.  Yet I always come out of there paying $5-$10 less than the ticketed price.  I have even gone in there needing small replacement items, willing to pay $10-$15 for it, but somehow I never end up paying.  The manager, Brian, is a goalie like myself, and I could spend all day talking about random things, equipment, or the state of the game.  I don't even bother ordering from catalogs or websites and go directly to BTM.

After seeing Amy P's review of this place I had to give my own. If you have read my other reviews it is plain to see I think I know what I am talking about when it comes to food. So, being a true NYer and a good Jew I love Chinese food. It's Kosher, right? Anyway, I have had my fair share of it and Dragon Palace stands up to almost all of it, save Chinese food in Seattle.   It is located in the corner of a strip mall, which Megan M pointed out is a little shady. Couldn't be more spot on. There is a bar in the opposite corner and run-down looking car wash close by. Putting that aside it is your stereotypical Chinese restaurant. It smells great when you walk in and there are a couple of cheap candy and toy machines right when you walk in. You are always greeted by the owner, who speaks passable and sometimes unintelligible English. Most of the time I am picking up food to go, but when I have eaten here the service has been very quick and attentive. It is good for big groups too.  No matter what you like in the way of Chinese food you will find it here. Everything I have eaten has been very good. The soups, appetizers, and main dishes are all consistent each time I order them, which is what I look for in a good eatery.   My favorites include the egg rolls, wonton soup, mo shu pork, house special chicken, mongolian beef, and lemon chicken.  The only thing that bugs me about this place, is what gets my Dad riled up every time we order from them. So after getting food from here for about 10 years my Dad started to notice that the bill was always ending in .0, .05, or .10 increments. So, this one time my Dad decided to figure out the bill himself, tax and all. When we went to pick up the food he argued with the owner for about 10 minutes about the fact that they were rounding up on the tax. It may have only been a few cents, but it pissed my Dad off. The owner said that they "don't deal in penny." My Dad retorted with, "Well the IRS does." The owner told him he was a big problem and would remember his name. He proceeded to storm off and cuss my Dad out in Chinese. To this day my Dad doesn't use his name to place pick up orders. It is still a running joke in my family. After all this we still order from them.

So met my best friends in the world, Z and Dally, here for lunch today. I drove the 33 miles to Mesa in order to try a sub that I have been told is amazing. So, having trusted Z on many a thing and as he would tell you, always trust him when it comes to food, I was gleefully happy at the end of my eating experience.   There are a lot of subs to choose from and it took me about 5 minutes to finally decide on the La Canna. Salami and ham with provolone and olives. Get it on the garlic-herb bread. Have the happy dude behind the counter throw on some spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar, Parmesan, and oregano. The sub is toasted and doesn't shred the rough of your mouth, which happens to me quite frequently. I was still not satiated after this sub, so I split the White Widow with Z. Marinated chicken, bacon, provolone and ranch dressing. Again another great sub.   The employees were all in a good mood. Not sure if that was herb induced or not, but it was pleasant. Phylis behind the register was particularly kind. She came complete with the stereotypical stoner laugh. She's cute.   It was totally worth the drive and I will be back in the future to try something else.

One great thing about Houston's: CONSISTENCY! Every time I go it is great. I have never left feeling unsatisfied or pissed because I spent money on food that was terrible. I am sure this is one of the reasons why Houston's has been around for a long time.   For starters go with the Spinach Dip. Best I have ever had! They give you sour cream and salsa to mix it up a bit, but I am a purest and stick with just the chips and the dip. They have a somewhat limited selection of beers, but offer the main stays of domestic lights. They also have a beer I have grown to love, Sessions. It's an American lager, similar to Stella in taste. It comes in what looks like a Red Stripe bottle.   The service at this location has always been great. They are very attentive and are always there to fill up your water or see if you need another drink. There can be a wait here so make reservations or be prepared to wait. There is a bar to wait and grab a drink beforehand, which always makes the time go by faster.   Normally I get the Ahi Tuna entree, when they have it. It comes seared, so rare, but I look mine a little more well done and the staff is always accommodating. The seasonal vegetables that are served with most of the entrees are fresh and either steamed or sauteed perfectly, plus they put a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top. Good touch. I have had the cheeseburger also. It has slowly grown on me. I didn't like it at first, but it is tasty. The fries are great too. I have also had the dirty rice and beans on the side. Black beans and white rice. Nice compliment if you are having a small salad or something.   Can't say that I have had dessert. I think most of their choices have nuts in them. I despise nuts.

As you may have read in a previous review, so graciously provided by Dally, that Four Peaks is our post-Tuesday night hockey watering hole. We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway.   Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway.   We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat.   I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now "famous" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable.  I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter.  If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here.  Until then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale.  The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet.  Tell Karina Brad sent you.  You won't get a discount, maybe just a laugh.

Now, anyone who knows me, knows my creative side of the brain has little to no activity. With that being said I am giving the Phoenix Art Museum 5 stars. I can't critique the paintings, I don't know how to interpret the different pieces, and I sure as hell couldn't tell you the different types of painting styles used, but I would really recommend visiting the museum one day.   I spent a couple of hours here one rainy Sunday afternoon with the lovely Ms. M. She is an art student and was able to explain all the artsy stuff to me. Upon walking into the building I immediately noticed the architecture and would love to have a home that looked like it. It looks a little on the cold side, but very modern and sleek. There is a chandelier type piece right in front that is very cool looking. For the Star Wars geeks, it looks like when Alderon gets blown up by the Death Star.   I went to see 2 exhibits in particular, the Ansel Adams exhibit and a piece called Fireflies. I have always liked Ansel Adams since my father is a photographer and always had his prints around the house and in his studio, so I grew to like them. There are some very beautiful photos throughout and the ones from Yosemite are particularly stunning. The second exhibit blew me away. You walk into a dark room with mirrors surrounding you on all walls and the floor. There are strings of LED lights that are multicolored hanging down and they go off and on at random intervals. It feels like you are just staring into the night sky with the mirrors giving you this sense of endless space. This was very cool and would have been fulfilling had this been the only thing I saw.   There were a few others that were very cool as well. One called "Mass(Colder Dark Matter)". This was a piece comprised of pieces of wood from a church in Texas that had been destroyed by fire from being hit by lightning. The pieces of charred wood were suspended from the ceiling with the center containing larger pieces and smaller pieces out to the sides. There were still nails and such embedded into the wood. Again, Star Wars nerd alert, this looks like any asteroid field the Millenium Falcon had to fly through in Empire Strikes Back, last reference to Star Wars. I promise.   The wall of paper in varying degrees of reds, yellows, pinks, oranges, greens, and blues was just visually amazing. The pieces utilize the sides of the colored paper. The name of the exhibit escapes. The last one that I really enjoyed was a piece that when you looked at it straight on, was just a few pieces of metal that didn't look like anything at all. When you look at it from the side though, it becomes an airplane. They have a camera and a monitor set up at the perfect angle so you can really see it. Very cool.   So, even if you don't understand art you can visit this great museum and try to expand your horizons just a little. I know Ignite Phoenix #7 will be here and I am looking forward to going back to hopefully be able to sneak around to check these exhibits out again.  The two links are for the Mass(Colder Dark Matter) and Fireflies pieces.  http://www.phxart.org/slideshow/index.html#/COL/72157606315913654/3595186209/  http://www.phxart.org/slideshow/index.html#/COL/72157606315913654/2677477643/

If a half star could be given I would in the case of Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles.   I had heard about this place from someone at work who said he went there every Sunday after church. I was a little skeptical, but really wanted to try it. A date was set with a few of us from work and I couldn't wait. Sadly it was cancelled. Brad was sad :( But then Dallas G suggests we go there that same Friday night after a bunch of drinks. So Saturday morning I made the long trek from Cave Creek to downtown.   When I arrived I was a little worried about my car, but figured it's not worth anything anymore anyway. I only had to wait about 5 minutes as my 3 friends were already waiting for a bit. I had studied the menu online a couple of days prior and already knew what I wanted. So I got my Betty Boop, mac and cheese, and lemonade in the mason jar. My good buddy Z laughed at me a little for ordering the Betty Boop.   So the fried chicken breast, waffle, with the ice cream sized scoop of butter on it, come out, along with the mac & cheese. Needless to say the food was awesome! The waffle was buttery, a little cinnamony, and delicious. The chicken breast was good, a little dry, but I had no problem cleaning all the meat off. The mac & cheese was good too. The best part was when the bits of fried batter would fall off into some syrup. This is a dish unto itself. The salty and sweet were awesome. Reminded me of bacon and syrup.   Prices weren't high at all. Great place for some next day drinking recovery. I have been raving about it to all of my friends since. In fact, I think we will be going this Saturday.

I was rear ended about a month ago and was devastated that my baby was tarnished.  My boss at work recently had repairs done to one of his vehicles and used Scott's.  So, after talking with the other guys insurance company, I went right to Scott's Coach Works for an estimate.  Matt was my service rep and was able to do the estimate very quickly while I waited.  After that he handled everything with the insurance company, save the rental car.  I just picked up my car this morning and it looks better than it did before the accident.  New shiny bumper with perfect paint.  Matt did a great job handling everything and the service was super fast.  They even washed and waxed her for me.  I would strongly recommend Scott's to anyone needing to have body work done.

Went to Grazie's with the family back in May on a suggestion from my sister in law. We took the visiting grandfather and his wife(that's another story), who can be a little hard to please when it comes to food, so we were a little nervous. We got there early on a Friday night and the place was not yet busy. We had a nice table by the front patio and were helped promptly.   We started our meal with some bruschetta and a couple of caprese salads. Both were very good. The table ordered 3 pizzas. All were good sized and delicious. We had the Margherita, the Vegetariana, and one with pepperoni and sausage.  The Vegetarian was my favorite.  It was a white pizza, so no sauce, covered with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers.  Delicious!  The other two were good, but not my faves.  We ordered a couple of the dessert calzones and a tiramisu.  The tiramisu was great, but the dessert calzones were incredible!  A doughy pastry stuffed with a banana and nutella spread.  It was then baked and covered with vanilla ice cream.  Decadent to say the least.  Several people at the table ordered coffee.  They said it was good, not a coffee drinker.  Overall a great dining experience.  I would put the pizza on par with Bianco, mainly because of the wait time.  The patio looked very inviting and would be a great lunch spot in the spring or dinner in the summer.  I'll be back!

I am quickly spending more than I make, with a lot of that money going to Nordstrom.  I find myself there looking at something in the Mens department, The Rail, and I will pick it up, hold it for a bit, and then I buy it without much more thought.  I will agree that their inventory can sometimes be lacking a bit.  They do carry Diesel jeans, which are quickly filling up my closet.  The bonus, if you can call it that, is that my Nordstrom card has a $4K limit.  So instant gratification with delayed pain always makes me happy.  I have always had great service here, without too much pressure, as the sales people do get a bit of a commission.    I am in for it when the Nordstrom at City North opens next year.  Hopefully i will not be living near it by then, for my wallets sake anyway.

The OPH is a little hole in the wall next to a Motel 6, just before Fashion Square. It may seem a little dingy at first, but its breakfast, not an elegant dinner. Every time I have been here I have enjoyed the food.   I have become fond of the Banana Pancakes. They are served with chunks of bananas in the batter. I believe they come with coconut flakes on top, but I hold those since I am not a fan. They are oh so good. There regular breakfast is good too. I am usually pretty bland when it comes to breakfast. Just give me some bacon, eggs, and hash browns and I'm good. Most selections come with pancakes and for a small fee you can substitute speciality pancakes. The waffles are good too, they are big just like everything else here.   It would have been 5 stars if not for the whole, "we don't accept plastic" deal. Just plan ahead or use the ATM machine they now have. I should have gotten in that business and sold them one. Damn it!

Well, this review would have been very different had I written it after the first time I went to Drift. I had a blast! It was a friends birthday, there were a lot of people, and good music was playing. Granted it was a Saturday night. My most recent visit, a Thursday, left a lot to be desired. I went with people from work and we aren't the most raucous group, but we aren't sticks in the mud.   We walked in at about 7PM and the place was D-E-D dead! Maybe their HH just ended, but there were like 12 people there. We were going to sit outside, but there weren't enough seats to accommodate a group of 8. So inside at a booth it was. When our server came over it felt like were messing up her day. She was cute, but had the personality of wet drywall. Not even a smile for a witty remark about how she was going to hate us in 10 minutes or that she might already. She was a total downer. Then it seemed like they turned on the heat, because a couple of us started sweating.   We all left thinking that we should have gone somewhere else.  All in all a poor experience and will not mind if I don't go back.

Not too much I can say that hasn't already been said. A great little no frills bar in the heart of Old Town. Cheap beer, gross bathrooms, a nice patio area, and friendly people.   There have been a few interesting evenings enjoyed at this fine establishment, by my friends and I. There is the classic quote from Dallas G,"Objects in motion, remain in motion." The classic story of love that couldn't "grow" between a male and female friend originated here as well. Great memories and they serve ice cold Stella.   Deducting 1 star for the apparent lack of volume control on the jukebox. Couldn't hear it at all last week. Otherwise, always good times at the Coach House.

I think I might be a 5-star whore! But Grimaldi's definitely deserves it. Let me say that I was born in New York and have tasted the very finest in pizza offerings. I would put Grimaldi's up against any pizza joint in NY.   First the place. I have been to both the Old Town and DC Ranch locations. I like the Old Town one better. Not sure why, I just do. The restaurant is nice and has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor is perfect for a day drink in the spring or evening dinner in the summer. Cool patio. Indoors is a little tight, but the tables all have the traditional red and white checkered table cloth. The brick-ovens are also open to the restaurant. Nice touch.   Food and bevy. There is a decent selection of beers, including Peroni. I am a beer snob and like to drink the beer from whatever region the food is from. I have had wine here, but not a big connoisseur so my opinion wouldn't be too reliable. I have always gotten the salad with a pizza. It is very simple so don't expect something with lots of ingredients. For me the salad takes me back to when I was a kid eating at my grandmother's. She always made a simple salad with oil and vinegar, tomatoes, onions, and maybe olives. Sprinkle some salt and done. It is good, get it.   The real reason why everyone goes is the pizza of course. Can't remember all of the combos of toppings I've had, but so far the best has been ricotta and sun-dried tomatoes. The ricotta was so creamy it was like having dessert. I love thin crust pizza that is crunchy on the bottom and crust, but soft under the cheese and sauce. Doesn't disappoint. Just a plain cheese pizza is sublime as well. The pepperoni is awesome too! They are smaller than the usually fare, but they cook it long enough so the sides curl up and get crunchy. My friend Z picks them off and gives them to his wife because she loves them so much.   I have been there once when someone has gotten dessert. Funny story. He got depressed when someone at the table told him they reminded him of a friend of theirs. When a pic was shown of this friend, it was some large man that looked nothing like my friend. So, he put his head in his hands and said he didn't want his cannoli anymore because his feelings were hurt. The person sitting next to me picked up his fork, got a piece of the cannoli on it and fed him. He instantly cheered up. Maybe you had to be there.   Anyway, go to Grimaldi's. You will not be disappointed!

I can't believe I got to review this place before the DG! I feel honored and privileged. For all of the 2 star haters: THIS PLACE IS DOPE!!!!   I have never eaten food here. It has always been too late in the night for that. Plus, there was only one thing on our minds when we go. KARA-fucking-OKE!!! Well, I mostly am inebriated and Z and Dally want to sing. The people that run the jams remind me of the house band at the Dresden in Swingers. There is always this older dude there that insists on playing the bongos along to every song. Even if it doesn't fit.   Inevitably we sing "Don't Stop Believin'", "Piano Man", and "Sweet Caroline". It will be a group of us guys and it is a good time had by all. One time I worked up the courage to sing a song with my buddy Z that didn't involve everyone at the bar. We did "Black" by Pearl Jam. I think it went well. It felt like it did anyway.   I always have a blast when I am here. Save the time my ex-wife and the girl I was seeing at the time came within about 5 feet of each other. It felt like my head was going to explode. I think Garth Algar said it best,"Did you ever see that part in Scanners when that guys head exploded?" No amount of alcohol could have made me drunk that night.     You will see a very eclectic mix of people in here, but don't be scared.

Let me start by saying that each and every time I get suckered/dragged into going here, it reaffirms my vitriol hatred for this "establishment". You know how as a man or woman(I assume) you size up people in the place and inevitably you hate those of the same sex for some reason or another? No, just me? OK then. Well, here I hate both sexes just as equally! I am not sure I can really even put my finger on it. Maybe it is the shear desperation that is on everyone's face as the night starts to wind down and the women get drunker and the men lamer.   The bar is filled with 40-60 year old men and women, who are looking for someone for the night. It is dark in the place so it is really hard to tell just how old some of the women are in this place. It could make for an interesting story I guess.   There really isn't one redeeming quality about Cocomo's. Maybe I just have my Haterade before I go to this place? Who knows. Skip it!

I am super stoked I am the first one to review this Safeway! This is the Safeway in my hood. If Cave Creek is the hood?   I don't actual do a lot of my shopping at Safeway. It is split between Costco, Target, and here. I have a few staples I come in for and that's about it. The odd beer run as well. There produce is always very fresh and well stocked. I mostly by my vegetables and the occasional fruit bunch here. The cashiers are always very nice and fast. They also don't mind when I walk in with about 5 minutes to go before closing. I also frequent the gas station here and steal me ma's fuel rewards! Thanks Claud!   I heart you Safeway!

Here is the deal with The Excalibur ( like King Arthur would say it). I went to this place the first weekend it opened up in 1990. I was 12 and thought it was the greatest. I have since been as an adult. And you know what? It is still ok in my book. When you go to Vegas you are not going for the room. You are going for the booze, hos, and craps. Most of the rooms have been updated and are nice enough for what they are. The gambling can be dirt cheap on the right day and time. Booze, well you should bring your own so you aren't doling out money for it when you could be using said money to throw dice. Hos. They are not top notch here, as the crowd the Excalibur attracts is more likely to watch NASCAR then the E! channel. Wait I have stayed here. HMMM. Go somewhere else and find hos and bring them back here. It works.   Bottom line: The Excalibur doesn't try to pretend to be this new fancy schmancy hotel and rip you on the room price. The casino floor has a lower ceiling and the smoke can be stifling. But there is a 24 hour Krispy Kreme where the donuts are fresh at 4am.   3 stars for the hotel, .5 stars for the Krispy Kreme, and .5 stars for the fellatio you can get back at the room = 4 stars

How can anyone not give the CROWN 5 stars?! This is a must whenever the buddies and I make our quarterly trip to Sin City. Where to start with C&A?   The beer. A huge selection of outstanding beers. The fact that they have Carlsberg makes me smile. Stella and Pilsner Urquel as well. They have beer for everyone there.   The food. Honestly, I can't really remember what I have eaten there. My buddy Z loves the Scotch Egg. A hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage. He lives for it!   The real reason we go there. The football. No, not throwball, but the real football. The first experience watching a game there had to be the best. My team lost mind you. Horribly. The atmosphere in the place at 4am was better than any place in the U.S. anytime of day for (insert lame sport here). Chants were being sung. Taunting was taking place from table to table, just before friendly handshakes and rounds being bought for one another. The greatest part of that night/morning had to be at about 7am. We stumbled outside to see the sun up already. Down the parking lot a bit there were 4 British guys. One of which was completely obliterated, yet still felt he could do a jumping spin kick into his friends face. He proceeds to pull down his pants to his knickers. Leaving his black socks on mind you. He lines up his buddy, takes a leap, spins, kicks, misses by a mile and falls on his ass hard. We almost threw up from laughing so hard. Just the thought of this happening again makes us go back.   We will be visiting the Crown and Anchor in 3 weeks time for the Liverpool v. Manchester United match on 3/14. I am sure it will be just as memorable.

I had waited to write a review for Bianco because it had been so long since I had been last, I felt I needed a refresher course. Last night I got one.   I took a date there and we were quoted an hour forty-five to two hours and 15 minutes. Seemed liked a lot for a Thursday night, but was planning on waiting. I thought the stars were totally aligned though when I was able to find a spot in their tiny parking lot. I guess it can't all be perfect. So we ventured over to Bar Bianco (review to follow) for a few drinks to pass the time. We were pleasantly surprised that in about an hour and a half they were ready for us next door.   We took the first available seating which was up at the bar. I have to say I forgot just how small this place is. The bar is nice, but we were both wishing the top of it came out a little more. It was a little awkward trying to sit on the stools straight. It does however make it more conducive to talking, almost like a table. The atmosphere was great and we even had a short conversation with a few of the other bar inhabitants.   The bartender/server was very attentive and greeted us right away. Took our drink order and he poured them right then and there. We decided to go with a Sonny Boy and the Biancoverde. Within 10 minutes, I think, they were both out and done to perfection. The salami on the Sonny Boy got nice a crispy on the edges and the olives were nice and salty. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Biancoverde. It is a white pizza with ricotta and arugula. It was nice and creamy. We ate all but two pieces and left feeling satisfied.   This is a great date place and I credit Z for suggesting it. If someone has never been downtown before take them here if you can get a table. It will surely impress them.

This is my first yelp review and I couldn't think of a better place to pop my proverbial cherry. So I am a creature of habit and the two times I have been to Barrio I think I have gotten the same exact meal from start to finish. I would say hands down just as good as the first time!   Let me start by saying I had never tried guacamole in my life due to the look of the consistency of it. I have a problem with that with some foods. But what better way to try something then being called out by a chick. So, I tried it and it was amazing! Now not having anything to compare it to may make this less reliable, but... The pomegranate that they mash into it was great. It sort of cut through the creaminess. I had the Adobo Pork and for those meat-eaters out there it will not disappoint. For dessert I have had the churro. Unbelievable! For those of us that have only had a fair or Disneyland churro in our lifetimes, this was like a religious experience. It is served very warm with cinnamon ice cream I think.   Be prepared to wait for a table or go later in the night because it is smaller and very popular. Oh yeah, the Sangria is tasty!!!

I couldn't believe I had yet to write a review for Burger Bar when I went to make a list of burger places. My humble apologies Burger Bar.   Located in between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, this joint has a plethora of add ons and options for you to create your own masterpiece. Much like El Guapo had presents in Three Amigos!   My choice of late has been a simple Ridgefield beef(don't splurge on the Kobe or anything special) with Swiss, caramelized onions, portabello and the red wine and shallot reduction. Which, we found out the reduction has veal in it, so it is not vegetarian, much to Dallas G's consternation. Don't get the burger cooked anymore than medium. It comes out perfect this way. Their sweet potato fries are really good too. They have a great beer selection as well. Dessert options are many, but I have been to full to try any of them. I have had the Peanut Butter shake, which is to die for. You can go a little over board on the price of your burger depending on the add ons and the amount you get. This is a staple on any of our Vegas trips. In fact, I don't think there has been one where we have not gone.

I don't think I have one bad thing to say about this hotel. I have stayed here twice now and each time the stay is better.   The rooms: All suites!!! How can you go wrong with that? Huge bathrooms with a separate tub and shower. The toilet is in its own room. Which came in handy on the last stay with 8 guys sharing a room. The beds? Ridiculously comfortable. Almost make you want to stay in bed all day. Almost. Nice living room area with large couch. 2 TVs, ample closet space, and a safe.  Garbage cans are good for getting ice for cooling down 1.5 liter bottles of vodka from Costco.  The hallways: Convenient pineapple slice shaped couches in the middle of the wings of the floor. Good for resting or passing out from a long night of imbibing in the last legal drug.   The stairwells: Good for some exercise should the thought of doing that pop in your head. Try 18 floors down, then up. You'll be good for the rest of the day.   The pool: I think they have a party pool now which is attached to Tao, but not sure. The regular pool is the shit though. There are a ton of chairs and even some pedestal beds. We commandeered one of these on our last trip and everyone else at the pool was jealous of the women we attracted to it. We were there in early spring so there were no servers for drinks, so we had to get up to get a drink. Travesty!   The gaming: Too rich for my blood.   Ok, so maybe some cons.  - What can seem like the Bataan Death March back to your room. Depending on where you are situated, be ready for the long haul.  - Grand Lux. Avoid it if you can.  - The sandwich place at the food court. Horrible. Try the pizza joint or Noodles Asia down the way.

Last trip Dallas G and I decided to do a quick trip to hang with Richard Z for a couple of days. Treasure Island had the best rates in the area of the strip we wanted to stay in. Plus we had never stayed here and we wanted to give it a shot. Pleasantly surprised.   The room was very nice, with the most comfortable bed of any hotel I have stayed in. The bathroom was big and clean. Shower didn't have a curtain, which is worth 2 stars alone.   We have gambled here a few times. The craps can be found for cheap and the dealers may even lower the table minimum if there is no action. Walked away one night $250 up on a $5 table. It was rad. Plus, the dealers were fun which is always a bonus.   There are no eateries to write home about. There used to be a sushi place called Social House, but it closed. Definitely give this place a shot if you are looking for somewhere to stay.

Delux is awesome!!! Any place that serves a Hebrew National hot dog is A-motherfing-OK with me. It is the only kind of hot dog I will eat, being a good Jew and all. It comes with sauerkraut and choice of mustards, or whatever else you want on it. Their "basket" of sweet potato fries are on time as well. Literally a small metal shopping basket. I like them with regular ketchup, but they are served with a dipping sauce that is pretty good. I have had the Delux Burger once. It was good as well, but i always get the dog.   They have a great selection of beers, but I always go to the old standby; Stella Artois, in authentic glass and all. My none beer drinking friend Dally even gets some sort of fruity ale-type beer. So it has a good mix.   They have a pretty decent dessert menu as well. I have split the banana split sundae before and couldn't get through it all. It could probably feed 4 or 5.   Delux is great. It is open late, but can have a wait earlier in the evening.

Damn it all to hell! If Richard Z or Dallas G beat me to one more review I am going to hurl myself from atop the Luxor obelisk, which by the way, Richard can't tell if it is here nor there. But I digress.   I was introduced to this little crepe place oh so many years ago by either Dallas or Richard and have been in love ever since. My staple was the Normandy, warm apples, caramel, and the ton of whipped cream everyone talks about. I was happy with this, content you could say. I have strayed in the past, trying a savory as opposed to sweet crepe, but it just wasn't the same.   This most recent trip to Sin City I was messaged by Mr Z and told about a new delectable crepe being offered: The Peanut Butter and Banana crepe. Anyone who knows me, knows my love affair with peanut butter is a long and satisfying one. Bananas are a new love and I recently discovered that the two combined are an unstoppable force.  Throw in a thin, chewy crepe, and some of the whipped cream and you have yourself... well just look at the picture.  The line for this place can seem like an eternity, but the people watching is entertaining.  Any trip to Vegas seems incomplete when we are just unable to fit Le Creperie into the mix.

Like the two star description says. Meh. I've experienced better. You think you are in Cheesecake Factory, minus the cheesecake. Same huge ass menu, comparable prices, but the only difference is that the Cheesecake Factory has better food. I have been three times to this one in The Venetian and each time the food was just eh. Granted the last time I went I was bombed and don't even remember what or how I ordered. I got some sort of burger with Thousand Island on some sort of bread that resembled 10 grit sandpaper. I have scars in my mouth to prove it.   There are two redeeming qualities for this location only: 1) It is in Vegas, so at least that means I am there and that always puts a smile on my face & B) One trip we were fortunate enough to observe a drunken woman get into an argument with another table from outside the restaurant. Said woman proceeded to grab plates from an empty table and hurl them toward the other party involved in the argument. She was subsequently carried off by security.

I finally have had a few selections at FEZ now and feel I can throw in my two cents. I like this place. It is sort of in an unassuming place along Central Ave, next to a FedEx store. The interior is pretty damn cool though! They have a bar up front with some high top tables. What I like is, the bar is sort of separated from the rest of the place by some smoked glass partitions. There is ample seating inside and on the patio, with also a small loungy area.   The dishes I have tried are as follows: the douxelle burger, the arugula and shrimp pizza, some sort of fried chicken sandwich, and of course, the sweet potato fries. The burger is really tasty, but I will say it can be a bit salty. Not sure what did it. The pizza was really good. It had a cream sauce on it, so if you are not hip to the bovine milk steer clear. The chicken sandwich was good, but not amazing. The sweet potato fries with apricot aioli? Holy Shnikes!!! The cinnamon and salt on the fries are like a celebration in your mouth! They are worth the price of admission.   The service has always been spot on and have never had any problems. I have been with a big group and small and they had no problem accommodating the big one in the lounge area. Candy, I believe, has been my server two times and has been fun and bubbly both times. Thomas S even comes over to say hi. Nice touch! I had my first amaretto on the rocks here. Fell in love!!!

Finally got to try Matt's EARLY one Sunday morning with the family.  Luckily they arrived well before I did and I didn't have to wait very long.  The place is small, like previous posters have alluded too.  You don't get how small until you actually go.  10 tables and 7 seats at the counter, tops.  The waits can be long and now I know why.  So we were a party of 8.  The parents sat at a table and the "kids" sat at the counter.  The menu is simple with not a lot to choose from.  I heard the pancakes were great, but I like a little more substance with my breakfast.  I chose the special, 3 egg scramble with bacon, cheddar, and fresh jalapenos, rosemary home fries and a tortilla.  Not being a huge jalapeno fan I almost had them nixed from the order, but decided to go with it.  Glad I did.  It was great and the peppers added a nice little bit of heat.  The rosemary home fries were outstanding!  I know all of this sounds very simple and you could probably make this at home, but it always tastes so much better when someone else makes it!    I think this place is worth the hype!

So I finally got to check out Carly's last night for a life coaching session and some dinner with the lovely Georgie S.   The restaurant is small and has few large tables so if you are bringing a small nation you may need reservations. It is a quaint dining area with a small bar at the back. Parking is easy enough with its own lot behind the building.   The food was good, wouldn't say great. We had the Mediterranean Bruschetta, which had sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. It was tasty. The bread has a nice crust, but was still soft. The roof of my mouth says thanks for that. I had the Ruben with a side of orzo salad. It was good as well, but could have used more pastrami. It was very thin and was not what I was expecting for the price. The orzo salad was also tiny. Maybe like an ice cream scoop size. Again, tasty, but left me wanting more.   The beer prices are awesome though! They had Kronnenborg for $2 and Spaten lager for $4. This really seems to be the hook that gets you in. There was a delightful dessert that passed by the table. It was a Nutella Croissant.   This would definitely be a nice little date place. I am sure it gets busy on Friday and Saturdays, especially 1st Fridays!

So, I think I have been to most of the Chipotles in the state.  The one thing they all have is consistency.  It is always great to pop in real quick and grab a bite.  At high noon at most locations you can wait a little longer, but it still isn't bad.  Their chicken is good, with next to no chewy bits.  I have been on a Carnitas kick of late.  Always juicy and never dry.  It is a little more expensive then most fast food joints, but the quality is way better.  Love Chipotle!

I have been to Shady's on a handful of occasions and always seems to be the last stop. It also seems to leave a bad taste in my mouth. You ever have a place th people like to go and they drag you along and you just know you are not going to have a good time? That's Shady's for me.   It always feels crowded. The smoking area is right outside and it just wafts in. There are these gray chairs that don't leave any room for legs because they are so close together. I always feel I get a hairy eyeball from the staff and other patrons. Maybe it's because I'm a douche and they hate me. Like the cantina scene in Star Wars. "We don't serve their kind here."  The drinks are on the cheap side and the Stella is ice cold. Maybe it's just a case of "It's not you, it's me Shady's."

So, I have been giving vegetarianism a shot the past couple weeks. Pescetarian may be a better word, but that is neither here nor there. I was invited to join Amber W's Vegeversary on Friday night and this was the spot she picked. I will admit, I was a little scared by the veggie/vegan only at an Indian place. Being the good Yelper I am I decided a new place to review would be enough of a draw. Kidding Amber :)   I arrived a little late and the table had already ordered, but the server came by with a menu and I, along with my brother and a friend, were able to order rather quickly. The table had ordered some apps of Cauliflower Manchurian and Batura, which is a large puffy bread. The cauliflower was great and the bread reminded me of the skin Goldmember eats in the Austin Powers movie, but it tasted great.   My brother and I ordered the Vegetables Manchurian and the Onion and Hot Chili Uthappam. The veggies were mashed together into a ball and then sauteed. Very good with a little bit of a kick to them. The Uthappam was a giant pancake with onions and other spices. It was really good and I could have eaten the whole thing myself. It reminded me of a potato latke. We shared other dishes at the table with everyone else. There was a pretty wide variety of dishes. Some kind of spinach, a dish with peas and paneer(awesome, BTW), and couple of others that I wouldn't begin to find on the menu without help. Rice is brought out with all of the dishes and it was cooked perfectly.   We divied up the bill and it was very affordable for the amount of food we all got to eat. The place will not be a staple on my regular rotation, but if someone says that is where we are meeting for dinner, there won't be any hesitation going back.   Minus one star for the sub arctic temps where I was sitting.

My very first memories of Ikea are not very happy ones.  When I was just a lad, my mother and father used to drag me and my brother 5 hours from New York to Pennsylvania just to go to Ikea.  We would sit in the car and then have to walk around this place for what seemed like an eternity.  I was digging in my pockets for some coins to pay the ferry man along the river Styx just to end my suffering.  My brother and I would find a living room setting and try to make the fake TVs work or try to find a couch to sleep on.  Then at the end my parents may or may not buy something and we would get Swedish Meatballs, which I didn't care for.  Altogether a hellish trip.  Fast forward 23 years.  Now I am an adult and can actually appreciate the finer things in life, like Ikea.  I love this place!  My bed, night stands, entertainment center, dresser, and my Poang chair.  All Ikea.  Yeah you have to put it together yourself.  Big f'n deal!  For a 1 like me, that means you get to follow instructions.  My favorite.  Plus it keeps the cost of the furniture down.  I will admit that the place is huge, but you have to go in with a game plan and know what you are looking for.  If not, prepare to be there for a minimum of 3 hours.  The food they offer now is great and cheap.  Yes, they still have the Swedish Meatballs and yes, I still loathe them.  The parking lot is big and there is always a spot.  Even if it is in East Jesus you can pull it up front to load up.  Avoid this place mid-day on the weekends or just before the beginning of fall semester at any college.  Been to the College Park, Maryland location at that time.  It was like my childhood all over again.

I was introduced to Dicks one Sunday morning and instantly fell in love. Ehm, um, I meant fell in love with Dick's Hideaway.  Not that there is anything wrong with falling in love with dicks.  Nevermind.  I love Mexican-style food for breakfast.  Why can't eggs be served with beans, tortillas, and green chile sauce?  I have had the Carne Adovado with eggs and the Huevos Ranchers.  Both are excellent.  Served with tortillas, potatoes, beans, and a healthy serving of cheese.  It has always come out piping hot on really cool pewter-type plates.  I love pewter plates!  Makes me feel like a knight or something.  It is not the biggest of places and sitting can be sparse depending on time of week and time of day.  Sundays they offer mimosas.  It is truly a hideaway.  It is hidden on the West side of 16th St in a strip mall, under cover of some viney type plant.  I have used type thing 4 times now.  Anyway, give this place a shot.  It is awesome.

The Clarendon Hotel, located in Downtown Phoenix, is a very cool hotel with a brand new restaurant located in the lobby. I was turned onto this place by none other than Dallas G when he began to bartend here. Or was it before that? Anyway, they have a rooftop bar with tables, cushy chairs and big couches. I believe that the bar is not open during the summer, but you can still go sit up there. In the spring, fall, and winter, the rooftop is great. Incredible views of the city, great weather, and just relaxing.   The pool is super cool too. I have yet to enjoy the pool itself, but have attended some events around the pool. The pool has some fiber optic lights in the bottom that remind me of stars, a little runway from one side to the other, and is open to the public on the weekends. They have several large beds surrounding the pool. There are also the customary chaise lounges and tables. I believe there is a bar outside during the day also.   I have sampled some of the food from the restaurant, Gallo Blanco, but not enough to review the entire restaurant. The corn on the cob with Mexican cheese is amazing, can't remember the real name. The little soft tacos they serve were very good as well.   Be sure to check out the Mens room ladies. The urinals are like The Rolling Stone lips, not sure if the Womens room has anything cool. I have yet to stay here so I can't comment on the rooms, but I have heard very good things. Go check this place out.

Haus Murphy is getting 4 BIG stars! Why not 5 you ask? Only because they are in Glendale and it takes an ungodly amount of time to trek out there. With that being said...   I have been to Murphy's 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely each time. I have never been to Germany or another really authentic German restaurant, save the German buffet at Epcot Center, so I don't think that really counts. The restaurant is on the smaller side and it can be very busy on the weekends, so make a reservation. They do have a nice beer garden outside where you can eat as well, weather permitting. They have a few larger booths in the front room, but have a large open area with tables and some community type tables in the bar area. I believe they have a polka band there on the weekends also. So if polka music is your bag you should check it out.   On to the important stuff. Food and beer! Again, their food has been consistent all 3 visits. They have a simple salad that comes with most entrees, but the dressing is awesome! The mushroom soup is great too! They also bring out warm, fresh pumpernickel and sourdough I believe. I have tried the chicken with mushrooms and cream sauce, the rouladen, and the meatloaf. I can't remember the name for the meatloaf, but that is essentially what it is. It comes with mashed potatoes and cabbage. It is fantastic! I believe it was served with a brown sauce/gravy. The offer a very large selection of beers. I have had the Spaten Lager and the Spaten Oktoberfest. Both quality. You have to get them in the large glass steins they offer. Lets keep it authentic folks.   The desserts are pretty good too. The Apple Strudel was very good, but does have nuts. If you can pick around them I would suggest it. The Black Forest cake was a little dry, but good.   If you live nearby or don't mind driving go and give Haus Murphy's a try.

Is there a better spot in Old Town for late night, drunk off your ass, gullet stuffing? I think not my friends! Any place where the serving staff can put up with the virtual bus load of people that come in here at 2am on a Friday or Saturday night, deserves 5 stars for that alone. Rae, who works behind the counter, is adorable and likes the witty banter. The sandwiches come out relatively quickly too.   I always seem to fall back on the Bada Bing. Italian meats, lettuce, tomato, provolone, and balsamic. It's pretty close to perfect in my book. I hear the chicken cutlet is amazing as well. Sweet potato fries and fried macaroni and cheese should round out your ordering as well.   The other perk is the people watching. You are sure to take home or be one of the stories of the night.

I have been to The Roosevelt several times now and recently took a date for a post dinner drink. This place is uber cool and laid back, but as other reviewers have stated, everyone does stare at you as you come and go. It wasn't too packed for a Friday night around 11PM. There were some chairs open and a couple seats at the bar. We opted for the bar. One complaint about the bar: It is very close to your knees. So be prepared to hit them few times. Other than that, seating was comfy. The bartender was attentive and helped with any questions. They have a bunch of small brews on tap, with the more well known selections available by the bottle. They have a decent wine selection, most only available by the bottle with a handful available by the glass. Didn't try any of the food.   The one star deduction is for the bathroom. There is only one and it was about 25 degrees warmer in there than the rest of the bar. Putting that a side, I love The Roosevelt.

After going there again on Thursday night after the OYE, I have to give 5 stars now.  I tried the Grilled Cheese and Tomato soup.  Holy Shnikes!!!  I could have had that tomato soup poured in a glass, with a straw, and just drank it all night.  Phenomenal!!!  Made me forget about the sauna/bathroom, which was still ridiculous, btw.  The grilled cheese was amazing too!

I love the VIG!  Situated in a part of town where you wouldn't necessarily think a cool, hip little bar would be found, but sure enough it's there.  They have a decent selection of beers, both bottles and on tap.  They have Stella so they automatically win me over in the beer department.  Other drinks I have had have been very drinkable.  Their food is not half bad either.  On the last trip I had the spinach-artichoke dip.  Wasn't too bad, but not impressive either.  Prior to that I had the carne asada on top of a potato latka.  Wow!  It was good.  i was mad at the Vig for a little because they got rid of the pork nachos, but have since forgiven them.  The atmosphere either inside or out on the patio is always great.  It can get loud, but its not church, right?  They have a suitable amount of heaters and fires going for colder nights and almost always enough seating.  I had never played bocce ball before coming here and had a blast playing slightly (read: VERY) flavored.  I also enjoy the Trivial Pursuit questions on the tables.  It allows me to actually use all of the useless information stored in my head.  Overall a cool place where it doesn't matter what you're wearing or who you are seen with.

I had to give an update to my favorite bar.  It is now 5 stars!  Why you ask?  Well, I spent the better part of Sunday, my last day of a long vacation, here and it couldn't have been more enjoyable.    A day drink was suggested and the Vig was the place to be apparently.  The place was packed inside and out.  Not a seat to be had outside.  There was a cool band playing cover songs.  The specials on Sunday are pretty sweet as well.  $3 Peronis, Margs, and half off bottles of wine.  Which if you don't finish your wine, they give you a nice little brown baggie to take it home in.  Ahhhh, the VIG.

After an impromptu happy hour organized by none other than Georgie S I feel I need to write a review. There were fellow Yelpers and non-Yelpers alike. Everyone had a grand time. How can you not when there are $1/$2 tacos, $4 nachos, and $2 Dos Lager on draft?!   I had the Mahi Mahi tacos on corn tortillas, which were $2. Plus 6ish Dos Equis. All for $35 including tip. Not too bad I thought. Our server was a little on the slow side, but we were having a good time and didn't mind too much. I tried the nachos and they were decent and for $4 nicely sized. We were sitting on the patio on a great early evening/night. Normally Tuesday nights are reserved for hockey, but being in between seasons a little HH was just what the doctor ordered. This night turned into an adventure with a drunken trip to the Grapevine. Solid!

Oh Dreamy Draw Park, how you kick my ass and I keep coming back for more.  I have been frequenting this part of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve for a few weeks now thanks to a suggestion/invitation from Dally.  We have since included our friend Drew to join us in attempting to conquer the numerous trails and unforgiving hills.  It has quickly become the after work running spot.  The easiest way to enter the park is off of the Squaw Peak, err, Piestewa Peak Parkway and the Northern exit.  To the east is the winding road to the park.  The parking lot can be full depending on the weather and time of day.  Most of the time there is still room, even on a busy day.    There are numerous trails to choose from and different levels of difficulty.  Lots of mountain bikers, dogs, and even some horses.  They even have a trough at the parking lot.  Drew is threatening to jump in it during the summer.  West Nile and all!!!  This is just another example of why Phoenix may just be the greatest city in the history of man!  There are points on your hike/run/ride where you can not see civilization and you feel like Bear Grylls on Man vs. Wild, looking for shrubs and little insects to eat should you get stranded.  Then you hear a plane or helicopter and realize you will be saved.  Side note:  The bathrooms can be a bit sketchy.  There are no doors on the stalls, in the Mens room at least.  Not sure about the Womens.

I have been to Yupha's twice now with the #ThaiThursday crew.  I have liked the two different dishes I have tried.  Don't even ask me to get the names right.  I have ordered by number both times.  The first was a noodle dish with shrimp and the second is the fried rice which I get with extra veggies.  I have gotten both dishes medium heat, they let you choose, and both times the top of my head has started sweating so consider yourself duelly warned.  The fried rice is really good and the portion is huge.  I, of course, eat every last grain on my plate and leave fully satiated.  It comes with a small spring roll and a soup and salad bar are included in the price of lunch.  The warm peanut dressing for the salad is really good.    Give the place a try if you are nearby for lunch.  The service is super fast too.

This would be 3.5 stars, but I am giving the benefit of the doubt here.   Say what you will about corporate, chain restaurants. The one thing you do get with them is consistency. Good or bad. At least you know what you are getting into. With that being said, I really enjoy the Yard House! Yes, an exclamation point.   The place has about 100 beers on tap to choose from. There is definitely something for everyone. They have all of my usual favs and some I have even gone out on a limb to try. The servers I have had have always been pretty knowledgeable about the beers and offer recommendations.   I have had several dishes here as well. If you like Mac & Cheese try theirs. It is a huge portion, has lots of cheese, bacon, and mushrooms. So it can't be bad. The Ahi Tuna Melt is good, with sweet potato fries. Spinach and Artichoke dip is good. Crab and lobster dip, although they do skimp a little on the lobster. Overall, I would say the food is above average and the service has always been great. They have a ton of TVs with different sports and will even change channels if you are looking for a particular game.   The Desert Ridge location does have one drawback: San Felipe's just moved in next door. So if you are here after about 9PM, you get the nice thumping from the noisy neighbor.

The Lost Leaf is this small little house in Downtown, that someone far smarter than I, had the where with all to turn into a cool little bar. If I owned a home like this, I may move everything out and have a bar put in, complete with the tattooed, pierced bartender and never ending beer selection.   You want chocolate beer? They got it. You want raspberry beer? They got it. You wanna mix chocolate beer and raspberry beer? Go for it! They have everything under the sun and then some. If you can't find a beer you like here, stop drinking beer. IPAs, ales, pilsners, lagers, and fruity beers all reside in peace here. They even let that white trash beer, PBR in. Which apparently costs only 2 bucks.   On my most recent visit the place was sweltering and it seems that their fans were pushing the air up and not down. Could someone take a look at that? Bathroom is large and clean. I don't know how some bands can even play there due to the size of the "stage" area, but there is always live music. I'll be back, soon.

If you have the money to stay in one of the suites.  I highly recommend you do so.  Stayed in one about 2 years ago and I was blown away.   Comfortable king sized bed, cool couch, view of the topless pool, dual head shower, and large jacuzzi tub.  Everything you could need is in the hotel itself.  You never really have to leave.  Tons of great restaurants to choose from.  Bobby Flay has one here and it was great, pricey for sure, but great food.  Most of the time they have top notch performers.  Saw Elton John, but missed Jerry Seinfeld.  The gaming is a little rich for my blood.  The Forum shops have the best shopping in Vegas.  There is a Diesel store.  Nuff said.  Be prepared to lay down some coin during your stay, but hey, you only live once.

I had not heard of this restaurant until the sister in law and brother suggested it for dinner after helping me with some last minute moving stuff. Upon first pulling up I was already stoked to try it.   It is valet only, but it is complimentary. You have to walk around to the front after parking in the back/side of the property. They have a cool patio out there, but it was actually a chilly night so I don't believe there was anyone out there. First impressions are huge and this place didn't disappoint. The kitchen is open so you can see it from just about every angle. The bar is open to the outside as well via a large garage-type door. There was a short wait which we passed by having a drink at the bar. The downstairs dining area looked very intimate, with low lighting, but not the type where you need a flashlight to eat your dinner. They got it just right.   We were seated upstairs where the first thing we noticed was the cork floors. Very interesting. Must have cost a bit as I believe cork flooring is pretty pricey. The upstairs would be great for a large birthday dinner, hint hint, wink wink. We were greeted by our server promptly and ordered right away since we had time to peruse the menu. I ordered an Ahi tuna sandwich which was done to perfection. Just the right amount of sear. The sister in law had the burger which looked pretty amazing as well. My brother made the best choice of the Pork Chili Verde. I am currently attempting vegetarinism/pescetarinism, but I had to cheat and try a bite. The pork literally melted in my mouth. It was Uh-Mazing!!! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys some really good pork.   The service was attentive all night and overall we had a great meal. I haven't been back since, but really need to get back there. This would be a really great date place too.

This place is the real deal.  I have been back twice now.  Once for dinner and once for lunch.  The food was amazing again!  The open-faced pork loin sandwich was just HEAVENLY!!!  Thick cut multi-grain bread, mashed sweet potatoes, braised greens, topped with 5 thin cut slices of pork loin covered in some sort of gravy brought down by angels.  A side of quinoa salad topped off this lunch.  Just check out the picture.  Nuff said.  HEAVENLY!!!

The lack of decent sushi bar in the Desert Ridge/Tatum Ranch area was sore on the area. Celsius is the ointment! This place is great. There were very few if any nearby sushi options worth trying, ie Ten. Which if you read Richard Z's review, I was there, it was that bad. But back to the place at hand.   The happy hour here, albeit short and a little early is cheap and filling. It goes from 3-6, but they do have a reverse as well from 10-close. I remember eating there with someone during happy hour for a quick dinner, sans drinks. We walked out of there after getting 2 Spicy Crab, 2 Spicy Tuna, and a Crunchy Special(not on HH), stuffed and for under $20, before tip. The sushi is always consistent, consistently great. The Crunchy Special is my favorite. Tempura shrimp, crab mix, cucumber, covered in eel sauce and tempura flakes. I want some now just writing about it. They have regular Asian type food as well for the non-sushi eaters. Which is decent.   Service there has always been spot on as well. You can watch the sushi chef making rolls behind the counter via a camera and monitor mounted on top of the bar. They have a fine selection of beers and sake. They also have a pineapple infused vodka sitting in a big glass jug on top of the bar. I have been told it is good. Seating inside can be a little tight, but they do have a patio which is perfect in the spring and early summer, especially at night.   Go check this place out. It is near Desert Ridge, but you don't have to deal with the ridiculous parking.

Being the dessert fiend I have become over the years, Sprinkles scratches me right where I itch.  Dude, you wanna talk about delectable little mounds of mouth wateringly good cupcakes?  The discussion stops at Sprinkles.  I have tried about 5 of their flavors and settled on the Red Velvet as the best.  Moist, sweet, and delicious.  The cream cheese frosting is not too cream cheesy if that makes any sense.  Having one makes you long for an entire bakers dozen.  Their chocolate is pretty good, but I did not enjoy the vanilla cupcake or the marshmallow frosting.  A little too much.  I am going to have to go back and try the Banana with cream cheese frosting or chocolate frosting.  I was a little let down when they didn't have either of the Peanut Butter selections.  They don't make every kind of cupcake everyday.  The place itself is very cool.  It has a minimalist style and they proudly display all of the cupcakes right up front.  The cupcakes are a bit pricey, but IMHO, well worth it.

I am updating because I have since tried like 4 other cupcakes. I have begun to follow them on Twitter and as Richard Z has pointed out, they give away free ones every day.   -The Pumpkin with Cinnamon Cream Cheese frosting. Could be their best one.   - The Banana with Cream Cheese frosting. DIVINE!!!   - The Banana with Milk Chocolate frosting. Great, but not as good as the above. Although the girl that helped me, looked like an angel.   - The Peanut Butter Chip with Chocolate frosting. This was great too, but heard the Peanut Butter Chocolate is better.   This place is getting me fat.

I will start with a confession: I am a bit of a clothes whore. Straight male, likes buying clothing, BUT I am *terrible* at pairing clothing. I usually like to bring someone with me. Inevitably I try to bring Dallas G as the man has an eye. There is a part of me that feels weird asking another man for his opinion on how a shirt or a pair of jeans look, but I digress.   I have been wanting to check out Spoken for some time now and decided to today. I picked up Dally for our excursion. Spoken is a small boutique on Roosevelt next to Tammie Coe. On this day the selection was not huge, but everything was 50% off. Amber, the owner, was there to help me pick out clothes. They carry a number of different designer jeans and shirts. Per the usual there are more for the women then men, but there is ample to select from. I tried on a few button ups, but I was Goldilocks today and couldn't find one that fit quite right. Didn't get a chance to try on any jeans, but do I really NEED another pair? I have been looking for a blazer and found one I liked. Amber helped me pair it with a tee and it looks awesome. Can't wait to wear it out.   I have never been into a shop like that before and it was awesome having Amber there for advice. I gave her a hard time for saying everything looked good because she wanted me to buy, but she did let me know when something just didn't work. Check this place out when you can.

Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!

My parents love Carmella's and probably eat there 5 times a month, which means I call them frequently and ask what they are doing for dinner.  Most of the time I get a free meal out of it.    They are a family owned and run establishment and are very friendly.  My parents are on a first name basis with the owner.  I've had Italian food in North Beach(San Fran's Little Italy) and Little Italy in NY.  Not that this place is as good as those, but it is way better than any chain we have in the valley.  They have a good balance of pasta and meat dishes.  The specials that are offered are pretty good too.    One thing I was surprised by was the quality of their pizza.  This is what gave them the 4 stars.  You wouldn't expect a sit-down restaurant to have decent pizza, but I was pleasantly surprised when I popped in on my parents and asked what was for dinner.  Lucky for me they both wanted pizza.  It was pretty close to the pizza I grew up with in NY.  The pieces were a little smaller, but had the same thin, crunchy crust and soft middle.  The cheese was also perfectly cooked, a little brown on the top and chewy.  If you live near Carmella's please give them a shot.  It would be a travesty should they have to close up shop.  The service is great and the owner is there all of the time to check up on you.

Sadly, this great family owned and run Italian restaurant has succumb to these difficult economic times. They have closed their doors. Wasn't there a bailout package for restaurants included in the 1 gazillion dollars the president has found?

So, I had been here before, for all of about 10 minutes and wasn't able to sample any food or beverage. On Thursday last week I was able to get the full experience.   I was taken here on a date. That's right, someone took ME here. That was a nice change of pace. We got there around 8 on a Thursday night and the place wasn't too busy. we sat inside right next to the roll up doors. The place used to be a firehouse. So there was perfect weather. We started the meal with drinks. She ordered a bottle of Sauv White. I finally got to try an Argentinian Malbec, full bodied(well that is what the waiter told me). The malbec was very good. I tried some of the Sauv, it was very tasty also. I usually don't like whites, but it wasn't too dry. We shared a small bowl of marinated olives. Kalamata and Green olives, very good. I ate most of it. For the main course I had the Salami & Manchego panini with pesto. OMG!!! This thing was awesome! Very toasty and buttery. I had half of it with a salad. The salad was simple greens with flaky tuna. Now, this could have been canned tuna and anyone who knows me, knows I hate this with every ounce of my being. With that being said, the salad was excellent. The tuna was marinated in vinegar and capers and took away a lot of the nastiness. It had a simple balsamic vinaigrette on it. I was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate. For dessert we split a flourless chocolate souffle. It had a very large, ripe strawberry on top and a huge dollop of fresh whip cream. If you like chocolate, get this and you won't be disappointed.   We finished up the food and headed to the patio. The patio is cozy with several fire pits and lots of seating. This would be a great patio for a day drink or to unwind at night. I have always wanted to try mate,pronounced Maw-tay (thanks Z), a traditional South American tea. It was very good, but on first taste reminded me of a cigar. Ask them for honey and put it in. Very good. They bring out a thermos type thing of hot water so you can just keep refilling. I highly recommend it.   This is a little gem in the heart of Sunnyslope. Great patio, very warm interior, great service, and great food. The food menu is small, but I bet everything is done to perfection. Large, interesting wine list for the wine aficionados out there.  I love when little local places blow me away.

Been to the Rose and Crown a couple of times now and have sampled some food. They have an extensive beer selection, including Sessions. It's an American lager. Very tasty! They also have Carlsberg, which I am told is the Bud Light of Europe. I still love it! The french fries are the TITS! They are so good I was unashamedly eating them off of someone else's plate without asking. I have had the Reuben and was uninspired. The corned beef was good, but overall just lacking. I guess that is what I get for getting a Jew sandwich at an Irish pub.   The decor is cool! There are futbol kits and scarves along the walls. Ya know soccer? Wonder if they show games there on the weekends? Do they have TVs? Oh well. The place is a little small, but quaint. They do have a nice patio that has ample space. Cool place to hang out on a spring night. I think they had live music too.

The Fashion Square location is the best one I have been to out of the locations in the valley.  My buddies and I have been there multiple times for day drinking and have never not had a great time.  Like the grammar?  We have always gotten drinks there with very little food, save the cornbread.  I am not a huge cornbread fan, but this cornbread is fantastic.  It always comes out hot with some butter.  Perfect for helping soak up copious amounts of alcohol.  And the alcohol of choice is the chambordrita.  These things are so strong that they limit it to 2 per person.  Somehow on a very long day of drinking my buddy Z had 4 and he was hammered.  We continued drinking after that mind you, but he could hardly stand.  They are tasty, but very cold so go slow.  The food I have had has been decent.  The chips and three different salsas they bring out are good and I have heard the guac is good as well.  I think I have had the green chili enchiladas which were tasty.  I have had some sort of shrimp dish that was palatable as well.  The service and atmosphere has always been above par.  The servers we have had have been personable and attentive.  Sitting on the patio on a spring day or early summer night is the tits.

First let me start off by saying I say I don't go here willingly and go when the group of people I am with want to go. Ok, ok, I am a sheep. This place just goes against everything that is right in this world.   Getting an overpriced drink here is like a Herculean task. There are always about 5-6 people deep around the entire bar waiting to get a drink. So you have to stand in the major thoroughfare in the hopes of getting drunk enough to somewhat enjoy yourself.  Whilst standing there you get bumped into by drunk bachelorettes, DB's, and out of towners who think this place is the TITS.  I mean that spells fun in my book.  I have never eaten the food here, save the cotton candy.  So I don't know if it is any good.  The one redeeming quality is that there is no cover and the line is never very long, so you can come and go as you please without having to have the tell tale stamp the next morning.  Oh, don't get me started on the bull!

Well, after a year and a few months of living a stones throw from Breadfruit, I finally made it in there.  To be honest with you I was not very impressed and left with a bad taste in my mouth.  I love supporting the local restaurants in my downtown, but I don't think I will be returning.  The girlfriend and I decided to come for dinner and we were both really excited to try the food.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our server, Craig, I think.  He was great with describing the food and how spicy and offered his recommendations.  We had the pumpkin soup to start with some of the Festival bread.  The soup was tasty, but was luke warm.  We both expected hot, maybe even a gazpacho-like soup, but luke warm?  It had a nice kick that snuck up on you, but the temperature really changed it.  The bread was really tasty though and we moved on to the entrees.  She had the chicken and dumpling dish.  The sauce had a curry taste to it and was very good.  The dumplings, while thick and hearty were good as well.  I opted for the Jerk Prawns.  Now, when I see Prawns on the menu I am expecting 3, maybe 4, *very* large shrimp, especially for $14.50.  When I got my plate I was underwhelmed to say the least.  I saw 5 medium shrimp on a skewer.  I will say they did taste good, but for the price I felt a little bent over.  The dish was accompanied by a cabbage slaw and a slice of grilled pineapple.  Overall, tasty but over priced.  What really got me was the bill, granted we each had a drink, and I knew how much mine was, it was $60 before gratuity.  Looking at the receipt I saw the Festival bread, which sounded like it came with the soup, was $3.50!  Two sticks of bread!  Needless to say I was just overcome with a sense of disappointment after hearing such great things.

I have had Mamma Mia's pizza 3 or 4 times now and each time it is as good as the last.  This pizza reminds me of my childhood pizza place in New York.  Thin crust that is well done, light on the sauce, cheese nice and bubbly and brown, and foldable replete with dripping grease.  Just the way a slice should be.  I have yet to try any toppings or a sub, but I am a purist when it comes to pizza and love plain cheese.  Well done Mamma Mia's.  Well done!

I had been jonesing to try the District for sometime after hearing rave reviews from several folks. I tried to get there for dessert one night, but was rebuffed by the host when I was told there was a private party. So when the opportunity arose to join the #smc crew one night before a movie, I jumped at the chance.   I saddled up to the bar while waiting for everyone else. It was kind of empty, but it was a Wednesday night. They didn't have the biggest selection of bottled beers and being the beer snob I am, I didn't want any of the domestics they offered. Thankfully they had Kiltlifter on tap. They had an extensive wine list as well, for those of you that are interested.   The rest of the group arrived and we sat a high top in the bar area. They had a Twitter special for $5 meals with a beer. I chose the Meatloaf sliders with caramelized onions and the Gumbo with sausage. The Meatloaf sliders were exceptional, although on the small side, but for $5 well worth it. Very savory sauce and the onions were perfect. The Gumbo wasn't as spicy as billed, but was very good too. The regular menu was a little pricier, but there were definitely some other dishes that caught my eye.   Georgie S was one of those in attendance and we decided to split the chocolate cake. This was heavenly! Very rich and perfect size for sharing.   Overall a good dining experience. One where I will be back for sure. It is also within walking distance of my building. The joys of living downtown...

I am bumping District up to 5 stars.  Why you ask?  The Buffalo Sloppy Joe with tater tots.  That's why!  De-Lightful.  It came on this buttery/potatoey bun and was the perfect mix of sloppy and tasty.  The tots came in this little cast iron pot.  They were great, although I did find myself longing for about another 100 or so.  I was also able to sample the tomato soup my lunch companion had ordered.  Very delicious as well.  Plus they are open for lunch on Sundays.  Most places downtown were closed.  I heart District!!!

Alright, I am bumping Sens up to a four star.  I tried the Mint Shrimp and was floored.  Uh-Mazing!!!  The serving is small, two pieces, so order two.  The Fried Wontons did not disappoint once again.  I tried an unfiltered sake.  This was great as well.  Our server was attentive and fast.  I can see them going to a 5 star with another visit or two.

It is time I give credit, where credit is due.  Sens is a 5 star dining establishment.  Hands down.  If you don't think so we may have to go toe to toe.  Bacon wrapped dates=Amazing!  Soup Gyoza=Addicting!  Green Papaya Spring Rolls=Refreshing!  Panko Shrimp=Guilty Pleasure!  Hot & Sour Soup=Well, HOT!  Sizzling Shrimp plate=T.A.S.T.Y.  Really, it's not just the food.  The bartenders/servers have always been super attentive, personable, and know the food.  The atmosphere on a busier night with the door rolled up and perfect weather.  Priceless experience.  I know everyone is always talking about how everyone is on Johnny's nuts, but come on, the dude is a super nice guy and knows how to put some damned tasty food together.

I had always heard about the legendary Hanny's from Mr. Dallas G and finally got to pay this place a visit a few weeks back. I have since visited two more times for drinks and apps and a bathroom stop. More on those.   I was expecting some sort of sports bar type joint for some reason, I don't know why. Well, it is the polar opposite. Another hip downtown bar/restaurant that looks more like an upscale clothing store. Which, I found out it used to be. Ah-ha. The bar is in the middle of the joint and is brightly lit and open. What's cool is that they serve this thing called a "small plate" with prosciutto, fresh Parmesan, roasted pistachios, kalamata olives, and roasted red peppers. They slice the prosciutto and cut hunks off of a wheel of Parmesan right there. Awesome touch! Plus it tastes great and is only $4. The beer is also icy cold. I have also had the cauliflower, which has mushrooms, red peppers, chili flakes, and shoestring onions. This was really good as well.   The bathrooms. Everyone talks about these things. They are upstairs, down this Star Trek-esque corridor with mirrors and tiny tiles. There is only one marked door for a restroom(Mens). All the other doors are for stalls, I guess. I haven't stopped at any of those. They are sexy bathrooms. My guess was that these used to be dressing rooms. The DJ "spins" music from his laptop in a little nook upstairs.  This would be a great place for a first date or after dinner drinks on a first date.

I have been to SideBar a few times now and have enjoyed myself each time. It is a kind of tucked away place on 7th Ave and McDowell. If you can believe it, it is located on top of a Pei Wei. When you go it does feel like you are in on some sort of secret.   The parking for this place is ample. Although, the walk to and from the bar can be a little treacherous as there has been puddles on the way back every time. At least one person goes shin deep each time.   The ambiance is a very cool, hip one. There are plenty of couches and chairs, along with some larger tables. The bar area has several high tops. Seating at the bar is available also. The seats are just at a premium. There is music playing all the time, but it is not so loud that you can't have a conversation with the few people sitting around you.   I have only had beer, so I am unsure of the mixed drink prices. There beer selection is pretty extensive. Being a skunky beer lover, I usual go with Stella or Pilsner Urquell. I you haven't had this Czech beer I highly recommend it. Its name means "First Pilsner" in Czech. learned that on an episode of "Three Sheets". They have your standard domestics and a lot of domestic micro brews. Something for everyone I imagine.   Your friends will think you are uber cool if you take them here and they have never been.

So when I heard my brother's friends birthday would be here, I was a little skeptical. First, I had never heard of it and second I started to research it on Yelp. I was apprehensive after reading the reviews and was worried I would be wasting my money on sub-par food. Well after going, it was not horrible, but not a life changing experience either.   I was saddened when i found out it had replaced Tanneko. I actually liked that place. We had reservations because we were a big party, so we didn't wait long. There were, however, quite a few people waiting for a while after we sat down. It was your typical north Scottsdale crowd. Every woman looked the same and every guy looked like a DB.   The food. I enjoyed the chips and salsa. It's hard to mess up. Had a couple of Dos Equis which they had on tap. They came out promptly and cold. I ordered the Carnitas tacos. They came with rice and beans. There were two tacos and you have a choice of tortilla. They were pretty good. Again, nothing spectacular. The black beans I had were good, but the rice was just like buttered white rice that someone mentioned in a previous review. My brother had the machaca burrito which was huge and he seemed to enjoy.   A couple of funny anecdotes. I think we had runners bring food for other tables to ours about 3 times. They seemed a little lost all night. Later on when the right food came, my brother asked the runner which of the two identical burritos was chicken and which was beef. The runner said, and I quote, "Dude, they just give me the food and tell me where to take it." No effing joke!   Overall, you could probably skip this place and come back when it changes to some other ethnic-type food place in a year.

I have been to The Lodge on several occasions, but was reluctant to write a review before I had tried some sort of food item. Beer is pretty much the same everywhere. This was the chosen spot for the post-OYE hang out. Like Nikki F said, this is definitely a man's man bar. There are stuffed cadavers of all sorts of fured and feathered animalia. Obviously by the name they are trying to give you that ski lodge/cabin feel. They have accomplished just that. There were lumberjacks and snow bunnies everywhere you looked. Well, maybe not, but you could picture them.   Dallas G and I each got the black bean burger and I'll be damned, it was tasty! Lettuce, tomato,and onion topped the patty. I will say it could use avocado or something, but still good. Tater tots accompanied the burger on the plate. Oh, how tater tots harken back to a simpler time when all you were worried about was whether or not the next GI Joe or Transformers cartoon would be on after school. I think Amber W had some sort of salad, but I wasn't really paying attention.  Interesting side note. Two very attractive and scantily clad women were chatting up two Tony Soprano look alikes at the bar. Now, I am not judging these two women, *however*, they appeared to be "on the clock". These guys were not that charming and they certainly weren't that good looking. Brady K and Jared M both confirmed my suspicions.  So check out The Lodge. You may just see a hooker.

I used to live by this Humble Pie and never went. Now that I live downtown I finally make it there? Go figure. I met the venerable Richard Z for lunch today. The other leg of the "Tripod", Dallas G was missing. The place wasn't too busy for lunch, but it was about 130 so the lunch rush may have already ended. We sat out on the patio since it was a typical 70 degree December day. Nice patio that is probably perfect at night.   The menu had salads, pastas, and of course pizzas. They offer a pretty good lunch special of an 8" pizza and salad for $8.95. They have specific pizzas for this on specific days, but our server said we could have any pizza we wanted. I give credit to Mr. Z and his charm for that. I decided on the Artichoke which had fontina and ricotta cheese, 3 different olives, and caramelized onions. I got the Veggie salad which had jicima, romaine, tomatoes, green beans, avacado, white beans, and fresh mozzarella with a herb vinagrette. The salad was very tasty. Z had the Cesar which he noted that the croutons were amazing. He subsequently bit his tongue in half following this statement. There was blood and everything.  Our pizzas came out before we were done with the salads, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Mine was very good, but I wish the crust wasn't as bready and a little more well done. Otherwise perfectly delicious. Z got the Egg pizza which had a sunny side up egg and panceta. He seemed very pleased with his selection. I could tell by the sounds coming from across the table. I also enjoyed one of the iciest Stellas I have ever had. Perfect for a day like today.  Overall a very good experience and I would definitely come back to this location or any of the others throughout the valley. Well done Humble Pie.

Loud, obnoxious music.  Obscene wait to get in.  An even more obscene wait to get a drink.  Ridiculous patrons.  The feeling of either being a sardine or herded cattle, take your pick.    I can say that I will not choose to come here again.  I will have to be dragged kicking and screaming like a 4 year old child who didn't get the toy they wanted whilst patronizing my Target store.  Skip it.  Oh.  The one star is for the drunk skanky women that end up dancing on the bar.  I am nothing if not a weak man.

I know I am gonna catch flak for this one.  Especially from Georgie S, who seems to be at a Mojo Yogurt in the greater Phoenix area everyday.  I wasn't impressed. (sheepishly covers vital areas of the body)  The yogurt was sort of icey and watery which seemed weird.  I did like the selection of flavors, which are not just your run of the mill flavors.  They offered non-dairy options as well.  I like the toppings bar and that you get to decide on how much or how little you get to put on.  I was disappointed that there were no Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  That is an automatic 1 star deduction as these are my absolute favorite.  I am told there are mini peanut butter cups, but not on this trip, and they aren't Reese's brand.  I could have eaten just a bowl of the cookie dough bits, sans yogurt.  Here you get what you pay for, as they calculate your total by the weight of your concoction.  Overall, not bad for a somewhat healthy dessert option.  I will have to give them another shot some day.

What can I say about Blue Martini? This place has become the new Barcelona in my opinion. Cougar Centrale! It is definitely an older female demographic. Now my opinion has been formed by just one jaunt into this place, but I'm sure it's the same on any given night. There will be the older drunk guys dancing with some woman they wouldn't want to be seen with on any other night. Drink prices weren't outlandish which you would sort of expect.   There are four bars in this joint. So getting a drink should be easy right? Negatory. It was like waiting for Hailey's Comet to order something. Plus you have to deal with the DB guys muscling their way in trying to jump the line.   Overall, if you are desperate for a place to go in CityNorth, this is probably the "classiest" joint there. Not sure I will be going back ever.

So, I have had Mojo before and even reviewed one location.  I wanted to try and get my mojo back so I tried another Mojo location.  I'll give it another shot, I'll give Mojo another shot.  I was nearing the end of my faux-date with Georgie S and things weren't going great, according to Georgie of course.  Isn't everything according to her?  I knew of only one place I would be able to turn things around.  Mojo Yogurt!  After a light rail ride to my car we drove to the Biltmore.  Now, I knew the concept and all so it wasn't anything new.  The only difference was they seemed to have more flavor choices at this location.  I mixed some cookie monster, cake batter, cookie dough bits, twix, kit-kat, and mini peanut butter cups.  To top it off I paid for Georgie's concoction as well.  I think she even muttered something about me being the best faux-date ever.  Sorry Nathan S :(  When I sat down to dig into my creation I was extremely happy.  The bits of kit-kat were the best, with the caramel freezing just a bit to make it crunchy.  I am glad I gave Mojo another shot and will be back in the future fo sho.

UCK!!!  I went in here a few weeks back with a couple of hockey buddies after a dinner at Yardhouse next door.  First off, we felt like we were already there while eating dinner because of the thumping of the walls from the music.  There is no cover, so that is a redeeming quality.  We walked in, used the bathroom and walked out.  Total round trip: 5 minutes.  This place will hold a lot of fodder for our website.  www.uradoosh.com  For sure!

This AJ'S isn't even on the Yelp map.  Now it is!    This particular location is tucked away in far North Scottsdale, just before The Summit at Ashler Hills.  You can easily miss it.  I am not a regular AJ'S shopper, but I was making dinner for my parents one night and was following a recipe to the T.  So I needed some speciality ingredients.  My beloved Safeway didn't carry them and then I remembered seeing this AJ'S.  They had everything I needed!  Just like other AJ'S the aisles are small, the people can be snotty, but the quality of food there is second to none.  It is definitely pricey so be prepared to drop some dough.  I would never make this my regular grocery store, but if I am going to be making a special meal here is where I would come for my supplies.  The parking lot here has covered parking for every spot!  That's what far North Scottsdale is all about!

I have nothing but great things to say about this animal clinic. They provide 24 hour service should you have a pet emergency. I had to bring my buddy Bauer(see pics) on several occasions. Much to my bank accounts consternation.   When Bauer was a puppy, he somehow got Parvo. At first I thought he was just a little sick and would be fine in a few hours. After a day of not being a puppy, off to the local vet we went. He told us he was just sick and should be fine in a day. When I told him he wasn't eating or drinking he suggested he could have something in his stomach and suggested x-rays. Which we did, at $500. To find no blockage or foreign object. The next day we went to the emergency clinic because he hadn't eaten and was throwing up bile. The vet, who was an older lady, picture your grandma, immediately said he had Parvo. Just by looking at him. The test proved her right. My boy was there for 3 days! They had only given him a 50/50 chance of making it. The nurses were great! They were very positive even though the outlook was bleak. They allowed me to visit him and gave me updates twice a day. When I went to pick him up he was a little out of it, but you could see he was better. Everyone was so nice and happy to see he had made it. $1500 well spent! We have since returned for a couple of other bank busting emergency trips. Every time we have the same experience.   I highly recommend this animal hospital if it is close by!

Came here for my first Yelp Office Hours last Thursday. I was very impressed with the layout of the place. It is very open and you don't feel like you are sitting on top of the stranger next to you. I feel like most coffee shops are really small and claustrophobic, ie Starbucks.  Lola's bucks that trend.  Dallas G, Richard Z and I decided to make a cameo here before our #ThaiThursday at Yupha's.  I didn't want to ruin lunch with a coffee, so I went with a yerba mate tea.  It wasn't served the traditional way with a bombilla, but it still tasted good.  The Yelp group occupied a large table in the center of the space.  Good conversation was had by all and new friends were made.  Sarah G brought some baked goods that knocked my socks off.  I have already requested that I get cookies sent to me on a weekly basis. Crosses fingers.  I will surely be returning and I heard they are opening a second location at 3rd Ave and Roosevelt.  Thanks Gabi for picking up the tab.  Can't wait to make the next Office Hours.

I can only start off with saying: Ehh...  The Parlor is cool looking and the interior puts off a good vibe.  Beyond that, I am not sure I will ever feel the need to go back.  I met friends for a late night drink on a Friday, maybe 10pm, and the place was dead.  Thought that was weird.  My second trip I tried some food.  I had been craving a salad and found one I liked on the menu.  So when I was ordering off of it the server told me it is the late night menu now.  Why was I given the full menu then?  Luckily the salad was on it.  The salad was good, but I think that was the last time we saw the server.  He seemed to be hating everything.  Overall, OK experience, but nothing to write home about.  My buddy had a pizza and later told me it was not so great.

Am I really the first to review? Well, I feel honoured. The British honoured.   I recently moved to the Downtown Phoenix area and during my search this is the place that really stuck out. Awesome location, new build, younger scene, and decent neighborhood. It is close to a lot of my favorite places. The Roosevelt, Lost Leaf, Sens, Matt's Big Breakfast. The list can go on and on.   I have been living here for about a month now and don't have any complaints. I am in a studio apartment on the 3rd floor of the building. I have an awesome view of downtown straight down 3rd and the Westward Ho to the west. Being a new build I am the first to live in my unit which is very nice. They are a very pet friendly building. Everyone seems to have a dog and they have two doggie clean up stations on the grounds. The pool is nice and open 24 hours. Heated also, but I haven't had the chance to try it out yet. I have been using the fitness center. It is a little small, but they do have free weights, machines, and 6 cardio machines and a yoga room.   There are spaces on the ground floor for live/work tenants. I believe only 3 or four of these are currently filled and hope some other businesses will move in there. Arizona Center is also directly across the street. I have already walked to dinner and the movies.   If you are moving to downtown please give this place a look. They offer move in specials and discounts on rent when new residents are recommended by current ones. *coughcough*

I am on a 2 star review tear!!! This place was just Eh. It was billed as a great burger from my brother. He let me down for the first time in my life. He said it was better than Burger Bar. Oh, Jacob...   I ordered a burger with Swiss, caramelized onions, and portabello mushrooms. This is something I get at Burger Bar and felt this was the only way to compare. It came out hot, which was nice, but for something that should have been full of flavor, there was just nothing there. I can't explain it. Maybe I should have pulled a Richard Z and dumped the Dead Sea on it. The bun was nice, though. So I left the table after dropping $16 on a burger that tasted like nothing.   The restaurant looks nice. 2 stars.

I've never been displeased with this location. It is across the street from work and even though we have a "Starbucks" in our cafeteria we come here. Better selection, plus we get out of the building. Everyone working here has always been super friendly.

This QT is located right next to the Candystore "Gentlemen's" club.  This corner was screaming for some other business to move in for years.  This QT is awesome!  Brightly lit, numerous and large filling stations, and super clean.  The gas here is a good 10 cents cheaper than the one a few miles north and south.  Which is huge for me since my car costs about $60-$70 to fill up.  I am the anti-Prius.  I also ran in and found they had Xyience Cran Razz.  My new addiction thanks to Richard Z.  I bought 3 in about 3 seconds.  Checkout time there is super fast and the employees are always really nice no matter time of day.

I have finally tried the workout Dallas G has been raving about. Amenzone didn't disappoint.   So we attended the early class, which meant 5:30AM! I somehow made it there on time. Most of the time I don't see that time of day, unless it is just getting in. The gym is in downtown in a cool little warehouse space. For this particular class we were outside in the back portion of the lot. There were no weights, benches, or rubber bands. All that was out there was the asphalt and old car and tractor tires. Definitely different. 4 rotations of 5 stations involving every muscle group, plus running. There was shadow boxing, stretching/yoga type moves and wind sprints to round out the workout.   Amen, the trainer, does a great job of keeping you motivated while you are testing your mental fitness about as much as your physical.  It is also a very mixed group of people, first timers like me, some very fit and some not so fit.  By the end of the class everyone is cheering on everyone else.  There is no need to be embarrassed or ashamed if you are unable to finish, but Amen and the group will try hard to keep you going.  My only regret so far, I haven't been back in two weeks. I have got to change that.

This is our new post-hockey game hangout.  It helps that it is in the rink and that our usual server Rachel is prompt.  It helps that she is cute also.  We came the first time on one of it's first nights and it wasn't very busy.  The manager let us play the virtual sports game.  It has hockey, football, soccer, baseball, and golf.  We played for free, but it is rather pricey to use.  It was fun, but I don't think it would be worth using your dollars on.  The bar is owned by the same people who own Overeasy in Phoenix.  I have only had the Black Bean Burger so far, but I tell you what.  It is f-ing good!  It has tomato, lettuce, red onion, and avocado.  I don't normally like avocado, but it's creaminess adds to it.  It has just a little bit of spice too. It comes with fries that are good enough.  The bar itself has cool interior and has lots of TVs around the place.  The booths even have their own televisions.  There is a large monitor at the front with a Wii hooked up.  I strained my shoulder after last weeks game bowling and playing ping pong.     So if you find yourself cheering on the Rubber Mallets, enjoying an ice skating session, or watching someone at a figure skating competition at the Alltel Ice Den, be sure to stop into 18 Degrees for a brew and a bite.

I have been a member for just under one year now, and I have really zero complaints. I'm not sure what all the griping about the actual gym is about. There have definitely been times when you wait for machines or a bench, but if you go during rush hour you need to expect that. I have also not had any issues with my actual membership fees or contract. All of the staff has been exceedingly nice.  The machines and other equipment are new and up to date and are seldom under repair. Most of the other members are respectful and there aren't any douche baggy meathead types. I have not taken them up on personal training, but I have overheard sessions in progress and all of them seem to be respectful and motivating.   I guess my one complaint, which isn't about the gym itself, is with some of the people who workout there. The benches are not meant for your personal belongings while you go and use some other machine or bench. Also, I use my cellphone in there, but for the love of all things holy, don't sit on a machine and text away while other people are actually trying to get in a workout. End rant.  Bottom line I have had a great experience and would recommend this gym to anyone.

Where to begin...  It all started as a youth on Long Island, NY, Plainview specifically. A rather unsavory family lived at the end of the block, but one of the kids in this family had a mohawk, like a real one. This is the mid-80's mind you. So seven year old self runs home and proceeds to proclaim to my mother that I want a mohawk. My mother immediately does what any good mother should do when a seven year old boy makes such a request, she said no. Emphatically. So she agreed to a buzz cut.  Fast forward eight years. Now I am an impressionable youth in Phoenix. I want my ear pierced. Where did this rebellious vein come from? So, again I ask my mother. This time I am presented with what can only be described as a Herculean Task. My mother, thinking she got one over on me, tells me the only way this will happen is if my father gets his ear pierced as well. A few of you have met my father, not the ear piercing type. YET, HE AGREES!!! Take that mom, sorry mom. I got one and then I ended with three total a few years later. Now I just have two.  I'm getting to the actual review, hang on.  I have always wanted a tattoo, but could never settle on anything I really wanted on me forever. I didn't want some trendy tribal or whatever. Well after having the old heart broken a few times, being told I can let my emotions come through in all parts of my life, and just being a softie in general, I figured it out one night with *The Dallas G.*. Over drinks I sort of blurted out I really wear my heart on my sleeve. Lightbulb!   I decided. Finally. I would get my heart on my sleeve. I settled on a design and since 27 Tattoo Studio is in my building I figured I would go there first to see what this was all about. I spoke with Apryl one day about what I wanted to do, where I wanted it, and the colors. She was more than accommodating and we set an appointment. The studio is not what people would think of when it comes to a tattoo shop. Bright, clean, cool memorabilia, and always some 80's movie playing on the big screen.   She gave me a time table, price quote, and we exchanged some emails going over the design. The day before I stopped in and went over the sketch Apryl came up with and it was exactly what I wanted. I was super excited for the next day. I was the only one downstairs when I got my tat, which was good because I thought I might cry. Apryl put me at ease and told me it wouldn't hurt, I didn't believe her. She started and it didn't! Well, the whole process was about 3 hours and Apryl was gentle. I am very pleased with the entire experience and will be going back to Apryl and 27 Tattoo Studio for my next project. Stay tuned!

I have since been back to have Apryl color on my body. Once again amazing experience! I had one larger piece completed over two sessions and a small quote done the same day I discussed it with her. A friend of mine asked for a reco for his new tattoo and I sent him right to Anthony and Apryl. They took care of him and he is thrilled with how it turned out.

I had been really interested in trying Beckett's after hearing great things about it on Twitter and such.  Then when I heard about the chocolate covered bacon dessert I was totally sold.  So for NYE my girlfriend and I took my parents out to Beckett's and everyone really enjoyed the food and the experience.  The parking situation is bit annoying as the area both in front and on the side of the building is rather small.  Go to the Zipps parking lot next door to find a spot on a busy night.  Upon walking in there is a very warm feeling to the place and that is the main philosophy of chef/owner Justin Beckett, make it feel like home.  I was able to make reservations via the website through OpenTable, that was very convenient.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our server very quickly.    The items on the menu make you think of home cooking, but a little done up.  I started off with the Matzo ball soup, which was done with a chicken broth.  It was good, but I still prefer my mother's recipe.  Everyone at the table got a different dish.  There was the beef bourginion, beef short ribs, chicken dumplings, and the "B" burger.  I devoured mine, which was served shepherd's pie style with mashed potatoes on top.  It was really quite delicious.  My mother ate all of her short ribs, which is unusual, and said they were fork tender.  Same for pops with the "B" burger.  The girlfriend had the dumplings and I would have to agree that they were a little on the bland side.  Probably the only complaint about the entrees.  For dessert we had the homemade S'mores, which included the chocolate covered bacon, whipped peanut butter, marshmallows, and graham crackers.  The bacon was of course the star of the plate, but the homemade marshmallows were very good.  My parents split the creme brule and enjoyed that as well.  Everyone loved the coffee also.  Overall a great dining experience from start to finish.  I can't wait to go back and try something new.

Been here more and more in the past few months. I have yet to see a show here, but I have enjoyed a few adult beverages and some food here. Drinks are cheap and they are made swiftly. I believe I had the veggie burrito, which did not come out as swiftly, but was damn tasty. The salsas they have for the table are quite amazing. So amazing, that I may or may not know someone who decided to "borrow" them for future use.   Hipster central, so just be prepared for a lot of flannel, beanies, and skinny jeans. Lines for the bathrooms are a staple.  I would like to catch a show here in the very near future, but they do have some fairly decent DJs on Friday and Saturday nights.

Sens redux. Only bigger, cooler lighting, and more bathrooms.  The only draw back to the move was that it is no longer within walking distance. I have to drive or take the light rail. First world problems. The food is still spot on. The changing choices of beers is great too. Reverse happy hours have taken some money from me. Take a date here. Putty in your hands. It can be a little loud from the DJ, but do you really need to hear what she is saying anyway? I kid.  I will be moving down the street from this place soon, so I see more visits in the future and maybe some long walks home.
