Does a great job for what it is. The food is decent for a bar, the menu is extensive, and they seem very organized. I've actually been very impressed with the prices. It's very easy to get a bite to eat and drink when you're in a hurry. But there's a lot of reasons to stay.   About three nights a week they have free Texas hold 'em. If you can get past the fact that it will be very packed you will really enjoy yourself. But be prepared for some good players. And watch out for Myrna. :)  They have a really good chicken strip and fries dish for the poker players that I highly recommend.  I love the bar area, lots of great beer on tap and friendly bartenders. The servers are always super fast.  Check it out!

I literally had three people walk past me, each saying "someone will be with you in a moment" before I even opened my mouth. LOL. Amazingly poor customer service. They're not rude, it's just that no one cares about their image or showing interest in your needs or problems. You really feel as if you're in a warehouse and not an electronic store. The only reason I continually go here is because of how cheap they're products are. I'm sure this is a top down issue I'm having stemming from money hungry executives who care more about the bottom line than people.

Really bad food. Only two stars because the server was nice. Had a featured spicy lime salad and chicken tortilla soup, and it winded up costing me 17$ before tip!

Solid good food, reasonable prices. Now that The Good Egg is merging into First Watch all my dreams are coming true! This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Phoenix. I always enjoy their hot coffee with lactose free cream. One of the few breakfast places that offers that. The bacon is absolutely delicious, I recommend getting it crispy. But one of my favorite dishes quinoa bowl. It has incredible flavor and is actually good for you. It's not often you can have a big breakfast actually feel good about it, with this dish you can.  Pancakes and eggs are always delicious, and the granola banana pancakes with peanut butter are to die for. My only caution is that you will get a lot of food. So don't order everything on the menu or you won't have room to eat it. :)

What happened?! I used to love this place. Tonight I was incredibly disappointed. The appetizer (chopped pork over jalape√±o tater tot) had no flavor, very bland. Three of us split it and all agreed. Horribly bland. When we complained about it there was no apology or taking it off the bill. The rest of the meal was just as bad. I had the Mac and cheese with chicken. Not interesting or special in the least. One table mate had the chicken pot pie galette which was dry and flavorless. And the other member of our group had the verde valley pork. He wasn't too happy either. Overall it was very tasteless. The drinks were good though.

Very solid, quality, delicious food. I have seen this place a thousand times and never tried it, I don't know why. It's actually quite good, and very reasonably priced. Service was great!

I rarely use Yelp, but it's time. I'm so sick of the service I get here at Fry's. The staff here always cops such an attitude.  Especially in the evenings when they only have one checkout line open and the get mad that I don't want to use the self service line. If I have a bunch of produce I don't need to be looking up codes and drafting algorithms just to pay for my groceries. And everytime I cave in and let them help me through self checkout, the service manager consistently gives me attitude and proceeds to make me feel like an idiot for not knowing how to look up produce codes.   I've decided ill start going back to Safeway across the street. Goodbye Fry's.

Fantastic all the way around!  Now granted, we came as guests for a Yelp Elite event. So full disclosure, they were probably at their best. That being said, they went above and beyond to show us just how delicious their food was, and how accommodating and friendly they were. I was able to sample three of their sliders, and have to say the corned beef as to die for. All their deserts and cookies were excellent. But what stood out the most for me was the bagels. I'm not a big bagel person myself but their strawberry bagels are one of the best things I've had the pleasure of devouring. I could pretty much eat those for 1000 years.   Highly recommend this place if you want some great comfort deli food. :)

I cannot understand why this place is rated so high. Portions are small, and the food was insanely bland. I had the breakfast bowl and a side of bacon. And my partner had the breakfast burrito. Neither had any flavor, including the strips of bacon. How do you ruin bacon? I don't get it. The staff is very friendly, and the dining room very well decorated and nice. But the food, omg!

Where do I start. Maybe I should write this review from the perspective of a probable management decision making process.   "Gentleman, Ladies, I'd like to propose some exciting changes for our customers when they enter Cafe Zupas. Please turn to page 739 of your agenda and follow along. - let's make our dining experience slightly offsetting with the ambient temperature 5 degrees cooler than it should be, regardless of the season.  - how about giving all acoustic treatments a back seat to permeate a constant drumming of noise, like a cheap bar at happy hour. Except sans Happy.  - what about all of our staff armed with little vocal cues that sound artificial and canned 'welcome to cafe Zupas, would you like to try our Wisconsin cauliflower soup?' - we've noticed that treating people with high pitched voices is the wave of the future. What about training all our staff with super robotic high pitch questions and statements that pierce the surrounding ruckus? - how about confusing the customer with a constant passing of help behind the salad bar, 'John will like help you make a salad, but Jessica makes the sandwiches, and Paula will take care of your soup. But if you don't want salad than my friend Gary over there will be positively happy to assist you in your sandwich selection!' :):):)xoxo - treat everyone like they're on a 3rd grade field trip.  - have the cashier require the customer to regurgitate again what they ordered, commanding further confusion and holding up the line.  - make sure the sandwiches taste like white bread. The white bread taste needs to come through over all else.  - insist on the soups being served in thin plastic bowls that have a 0.8 on the insulation meter.  - have soups waiting in said thin plastic bowls for over 5 mins while the customer waits in line behind regurgitated orders, or while white bread sandwich is made.  - salads, no change. Excepts serve toppings with 1/2 teaspoon serving spoons. Try and make the customer feel as special as possible with the pinch of strawberry flakes, 5 sesame seeds, three crushed pecans and two onion strings. Give the customer a disapproving look if they ask for a generous portion of anything. Look to manager immediately if any request is outside the 1/2 tsp mark.  - utilize the lowest grade chocolate on earth on strawberries and deserts. Go for a rubber or plastic texture. It should be similar to a child's squeeze toy, really. "   (Ok I'll stop. But seriously, I only go here because the taste of the soups are insanely good. Not hot, mind you, but very good. If they ever figure out how to save a buck and destroy this one asset I will literally call for a wrecking ball.)

We love this place!  Haven't been here in awhile which I regret it, and I was so impressed. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. Very attentive, full of suggestions, and courteous. We noticed several people that came in were regulars and were greeted by name.   As far as the food, we were not disappointed in the least. I had the Summit Skillet, and it was fantastic. My partner had the Chicken Fried Steak and we both thought it was one of the best we'd ever had.   The coffee was great, had non dairy creamers for us lactose free guys, and it was an overall wonderful experience.   I don't know why this place isn't rated higher. Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed. :) :) :) A++
