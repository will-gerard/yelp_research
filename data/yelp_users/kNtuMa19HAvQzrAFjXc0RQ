Dr.Carr is a favorite!!! I recommend him to everyone! He has taken excellent care of me. I have a completely irrational fear of dentist. I use to cry at every visit when I was young and no more tears since I've been here! Beverly remembers everything for me and they even call to make sure I'm ok the day after a big procedure! I just love my dentist and my beautiful white teeth!!

Ok. My much over due review. Dr. Sullivan has been my primary doc for years. He pulls out all the stop and goes above and beyond making calls to specialists and following up to make sure I've had the best care possible! He has worked with me when I changed jobs and insurance companies and coverage to make sure I have what I need to be healthy. This year he helped save my life. He and his team have had compassion and flexibility to make sure I felt like family.

The food here is always not the way you ordered it. Also the waitress and managers will give you attitude if you ask for it the way you ordered it. Came to watch sports and have a beer you might be ok but the glasses taste like cleaner. Sports bar quality is was it is but this location is the worst!

This is a local spot with the best chicken in town. Only serves a few things. Cash only!!! Very casual! It's packed at lunch with workers. Most dishes are served with onions and beans. I like a side of sour cream and make mine into tacos. I saw David spade last time I was in. There is an ATM in the shop next door if you need one.

Is there less than one star!!! Horrible experience!!!! My truck was towed from an accident in Scottsdale ($80 plus store fees) fine. Called Mark to have it towed to my body shop and $390 to have towed basically back here it started!!! What????!!!! That's right ! All they said was sorry we make the body shop pay that and bill your insurance company after!!

I went in for my usual dermaplane treatment but I booked it with the new girl. Sadly she didn't feel that was going to be the right service for me. I specifically like that they use Jan Marini products in their services but She wanted to use image products. At this point I should have stopped but I had the time blocked and I drove over so after much discussion and her assurance that I would love the treatment I tried it out. I felt the extractions were almost nonexistent and the real disappointment was since we started 20 minuets late she just subtracted 20 min from my service. Usually the shoulder massage would have made up for the lack of product or service I actually thought I was paying for but to only have time for half a service and charge full price?!?!? What. Don't waste your money with her.

The wash is a good one but they would honor my yelp check in offer and a letter is missing on the back of my SUV and they didn't offer to call me if it turns up!

Came in for $250 worth of work and an inspection. Came in the check engine light on and left with it still on. It was over looked they said sorry. And now I'm right back here looking at spending more money. I'd rather they didn't rush and get the work done right!
