Great airport with free WiFi. Lola coffee is legit. If in terminal c try some cartel coffee.

Excellent food. Had both the meatball sub and the chicken Parmesan sub. Really really good. Portions are huge and great quality. Definitely recommend.

I have been going to one stop for about 9 months, and I spend over a 100 dollars a month at this location. Going to one stop is already inconvenient but I go to spend my money with a local company and not a big chain. Unfortunately for me they showed me why I should spend my money at a big chain. I bought a protein powder that was suggested to me by the associate and after trying one drink I decided it wasnt for me as it tasted horrible. I took it back and asked to trade it out for something else and was told no. I was told for 14 years that its their policy and that was it. I would be ok with that but I know the GNC and Hi Healths of the world would take it back with no questions asked. So my advice is to avoid this place as customer service is not their focus, and if thats the case why go. You should go to the convenient and cheaper places like gnc or hi health. Its truly a shame when situations like this arise and you can either be a great company or a poor one. This company chose to be poor.

Fun little hike coming in at .75 miles up and down. Watch out for snakes though. I highly recommend the hike as it only takes about 20 minutes to complete.
