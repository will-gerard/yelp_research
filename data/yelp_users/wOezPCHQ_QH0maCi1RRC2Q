Great dive bar, come here after dodgeball to relax and socialize. Staff are great and always attentive. The burgers are awesome and they have a great  variety of beer and any mixed drink you can cook up! They have made some great upgrades with new big HD flatscreens, and shuffleboard. cool place to chill anytime!

Walked in and was seated immediately despite it being busy.  Waitress was over soon after to take my drink order and back quickly for food order. Food arrived quickly but had my eggs scrambled instead of over easy. Waitress apologized and returned soon after with correct order. Food was delicious and made well. I ordered crepes breakfast with strawberries and bananas. Would definitely come back.

Don't come here for restaurant week, overpriced menu for the food you get. Tried all 3 main dishes and they were all bland, needed to add lots of salt. Service was excellent on the plus side.

Best beer bar in Phoenix! Very knowledgeable and friendly staff, one of the best burgers in the state, constantly changing craft beer list (all good)! Recent "change" in management has made this place way better. New decor looks great! Try the wings too!

Great company, prompt professional service. Deric was very knowledgeable and even though I didn't find my keys gave me a great rate and some advice on the next steps. Definitely recommend if you are in need of locksmith service.

This is hands down my favorite brewery in AZ! They always have great beer and rotating taps of whatever new concoction they brewed up from saisons to imperial porters. They make great barrel aged beers and are starting to expand for even more greatness! The food is amazing every time and you have to try the AZ trail burger with the duck fat fries. Cant go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is great and knowledgeable as well and the brewers are always willing to chat if you have questions.

Came in on a Monday afternoon, sat at the bar and Nate was bartending. Very friendly and suggested the warm lobster roll (excellent.) Had an ice tea to drink and a kale salad as my side, the kale salad was a bit salty but still solid. Looked at the brunch menu and will definitely be back in. They also had a solid beer lineup, excited to come check it out with a group of friends on a weekend. 5 stars for service and lobster roll.
