I took my Labs here ...they did a great job. Only negative...they only take cash or checks...its the 21st...no one carries cash or checks :) get a debt reader and grow your business :)

I found this company on a daily offer special. They did my carpets and did a great job.  I had them come back about 6 months later...this time they did my carpet and tile (my tile was dirty)... everything looked GREAT. My kids looked at the tile and thought it was brand new. We have told many of our friends about this company...and they all have been very happy with the service. 2 BIG thumbs UP!!!

Excellent service...I have had my JEEP since 2008 and anytime I need service or have a question they are ready to help. I didn't buy my JEEP from them...I wasn't in the area at the time, so I can't comment on their sales teams...but service and parts team is top notch in my book.

I was helping my friend move out ...and they went back into to get the rest of their stuff and the apartment complex locked them out...let it be known...they were paid through the end of the month...hmm? So the rest of their stuff is still at the apartment which by law they have paid for until the end of the month. Can you say law suit?

My wife purchased a Living social offer for a photo shoot- and I was blown away on what a great job that Charles and his team did with our photo shoot. He made me and my family feel great...and was FANTASTIC with my kids!  My wife first met Charles when she purchased a different daily deal offer for one of his work shops. I would highly recommend his services to anyone. Great Job and many thanks!

So why does Yelp Filter my reviews??? I am a Yelper...had reviewed nearly 100 places...and I had a great experience with this company on Sunday and they "filter" my review...WTH??? Here it is again...  My wife purchased a Living social offer for a photo shoot- and I was blown away on what a great job that Charles and his team did with our photo shoot. He made me and my family feel great...and was FANTASTIC with my kids!  My wife first met Charles when she purchased a different daily deal offer for one of his work shops.
