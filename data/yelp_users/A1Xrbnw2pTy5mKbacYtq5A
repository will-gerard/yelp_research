I have eat here many times before, the sushi is very low priced. I have had some good experiences their , but this last time was horrible all the Sushi was disgusting ! I had about 3 rolls ,one roll off each plate and I could not eat any more! I went home puked  my brains out! It was not even edible.. Ya its only 7 bucks a roll.. But their is no quilty!! You pay for what you get!! And sometimes if your their when the fish is fresh is great but they don't go thru as much fish say as raw.. So it's a hit or miss... I will never go their again ! Spend the extra 15 bucks and go somewhere good! this place sucks will not suggest to anyone!

I always have had excellent fish and sushi here!! Never had a bad experience! Always quality food! The service may  not be the best. The food is on point though!!
