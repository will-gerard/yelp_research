Classic gym scammers  I have been at this gym for over a year and a half and the place was either too crowded or gym equipment was broken. So I started working out on my own and decided to cancel my membership. Went online and cancelled it. The website told me that my last day to go into the gym was Feb. 13th and that they were sad to see me go. Feb. 15th comes around and there is a $29.99 bill on my bank statement from them. I call and get a good amount of attitude from the women that I talked to but she finally agrees to cancel my account but would not refund my $29.99. March 15th comes around and lo and behold there is another $29.99 change from these scam artists. Called again and now they are telling me that I have to come in and cancel in person. WOW!!!!!!!!   Please do not ever give them your bank account number as they will lie to you just to make another $29.99 off you. Or $59.98 as is in my case.  Letting the Better Business Bureau now about this as well.

So tonight we went and saw Anchorman 2 and earlier bought tickets online. There was apparently was an issue with the process and when I got there my ticket was not in their system. Instead of giving me flack and having to go through the entire process again, the woman at the ticket office, whom I believe to be the manager, apologized for the issue and issued me a ticket no questions asked. Now this is an example of excellent customer service. One comp'd ticket goes a long way with me and will now be frequenting this theater when I go see future films. The theater was also clean, comfy and the rest of the cast working at the time was great. I definitely recommend the UltraStar Theatres for a great all around movie viewing experience!

Last week, a group of us went into the Mellow Mushroom restaurant in Tempe to have a "quick" lunch before a 1pm meeting. We got there at Noon, ordered and then waited, and waited, and waited. At 12:50pm I told my waitress that I had a 1pm meeting and please run my card now so I can take my food and run to my meeting. Well, I get my food at 1pm and it is the wrong order. Argghhh!! So I have the waitress send it back to the kitchen and have one of my coworkers bring it to me, but I am still waiting for my card which I gave to her 10 minutes ago and I have to go this meeting that I am already late for. My co-worker signs my card and I get my cold food later and again it's the wrong order. I eat it anyways and can't lie, it tasted really good.  Fast forward to today, where a co-worker and I had another 1pm meeting. We decide to work through lunch and order take out from them and give them another chance. I make our orders at 12:05pm and the girl says that it will take 20 minutes. So I go to pick them up at 12:30pm and they aren't ready. So again, I wait, and wait, and wait. While I am waiting I hear the kitchen manager and a server talking about a table where the customer was not so happy about having to wait so long for their food and was trying to get a discount. At that moment I hear the kitchen manager refer to the customer that is arguing this as a "douchebag". My jaw just dropped at what I have just heard. I have to go outside because I don't wanna hear more. So I continue to wait until I get our food at 12:55pm, 30 minutes after it was promised to me, we end up having to eat our food during our meeting. Uggh.   Now the food is great here, they do an great job at this but the customer service is absolutely dreadful and that is being nice. Surprising because there is usually 25 people working in there at one time. I do not recommend Mellow Mushroom unless you have a lot of time and patience, and don't mind the kitchen staff calling you "douchebag" and other names behind your back. I'll pass
