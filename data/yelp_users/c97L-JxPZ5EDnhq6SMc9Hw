Absolutely delicious! Gnocci alla Brian was amazing & their special, which consist of shrimp, homemade garlic cream sauce & mango= yum! Plus, staff & owner very friendly & attentive. We'll be back for sure!

First time we went here & we loved it! We sat at the bar top & up came the owner,  Ron,  which he sat next to another gentleman next to us. He chatted with him, then begin talking with us & I will tell ya, what a nice guy!   I got a scrambled eggs/ham & pancakes & my Husband got the 49 ers pancake, both were delicious!  The only reason I gave it a 4, was the wait on food, however it was New Years Day. Great breakfast! We'll be back.

We've been here about 4 or 5 times & the food is always just as good or better when we come. We love the *free* cheese crisp ( when you check in on Yelp) with the green chilis. Amazing! Highly recommended!

I will start off by saying that I came in craving a beef Wellington & my craving was definitely fulfilled! On top of the wonderful Wellington, the service was top notch. The bus boy was one of the friendliest guys I've met, so talkative & attentive. Our server & owner, George, was great. When you check in on yelp you get free potato skins, which were yummy! But on top of that, George gave us two free glasses of wine, for what he claimed to be "a long wait". We were enjoying our time, certainly didn't think we had been waiting long for our food at all. And finally, because it was our first time there, he brought us a delicious mud pie. Seriously... We needed them to wheel barrel us out of there, we had so much food.   They're a family run business, which I can appreciate as I have a family run business as well. They made us feel so welcome. We will definitely be back.

I also wrote this same review under just Dr. Hunt, but I figured I should also put it on their office to review as well.   I have a very detailed review regarding my experience with Dr. Hunt and her staff on google and Angie's list, however, I am limited on my space, so I will only tell the basics.  I had been a patient of Dr. Hunt's office for over 4 years. Dr. Hunt even delivered my 1st baby. Until I was pregnant, I never saw the same Dr. or NP twice in a row. Once I became pregnant, I mostly saw just Dr. Hunt (besides 2 times because she wasn't in). Throughout the years the waiting time got longer and longer. Almost every time I went in, the waiting room was full. There were times I waited up to an hour and 15 minutes, while I was pregnant. There were also times that I had to reschedule because they had over booked their patients and I didn't have the time to wait because I had to go back to work. Basically, they seemed to be very unorganized.  The staff were friendly, but very incompetent and had lack of communication.It makes sense why they had such a high turnover, and even then, they couldn't get it right. I can't even tell you how many messages I had left with no avail, which is what ultimately led to me finally finding another Doctor.  Dr. Hunt is a very knowledgeable doctor, however, she lacks the bed side manner that most women want in an Ob/gyn. She comes off very passive and, at times, very insincere.  It turns out, that if you have any questions or concerns and Dr. Hunt is not "available", whether it be her day off or she's out of town, you are to wait until her return.This had happened to me on numerous occasions. Not even her medical assistant, Anne, is able to get a hold of her and/or answer you questions, nor does she know how to return phone calls. Finally, after much frustration, I spoke to Dr. Hunt. I was thinking that once I spoke to Dr. Hunt, I would express my concerns and she would make me feel better. To my surprise, she did the exact opposite.  I addressed my frustration regarding receiving a return call when I have questions or concerns about prescribed medicine and/ or a question I may of forgot to ask while I was in there earlier that day/week, and how I didn't like that it would take me several days to get an answer. She, Dr. Hunt, proceeded to tell that, if she was off or out of town and my concerns were not " an emergency" or "important", that I had to wait. I expressed my confusion and told her that I was shocked how she ran her office. It was then, with a very matter-of-fact attitude, she said to me " maybe it's time you find another doctor". Shocked, I told her, I planned to. I was in a bit of dis-belief that she was quick to shoo me as a patient, as well as, the fact that she had no regard to my concerns or the obvious problems within her office.  I have since found another doctor, which I really like, but I am upset that I stayed with Dr. Hunt for so long. I trusted her. I let her deliver my baby. I should've found another doctor earlier, but to be honest, I didn't want to look for a new one once I became pregnant, which is when things in her office, really, became an issue.    This was, by far, the worst experience I have had with any kind of doctor. Lessened learned. I,now, do my homework when looking for doctors, which is how I found my new doctor, and hope it will help YOU to find a good doctor as well.

I've had their dinner numerous times & have always enjoyed it, but this is the first time I've had their breakfast,  and I've got to say..... DAMN! I absolutely loved it! I had the green pork & eggs & my husband had the green chilli biscuits & gravy. Both were phenomenal! They have a Benedict that looks great. We will definitely go back. If you like spicy New Mexican breakfast, you have to check this place out.

Great little mom & pop place. There was only an older gentleman making the food,  but then shortly after,  I believe,  his wife came in & started helping with the cooking. Eventhough we waited a longer than normal for our food, it was well worth it. I got a veggie pannini & a salad & my husband got a grilled cheese with tomato soup. Both really yummy. We will definitely go back.
