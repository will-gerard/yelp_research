How many ways can you spell DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I have had better BBQ on a HUNGRY MAN DINNER.   I had a friend in from Chicago this evening who was staying at the ALOFT by the airport. I wanted to impress him with the BBQ at HB's as he has taken me to some really great places in Chicago. This HB's was the first one I had eaten at when I first arrived in PHX. I last ate here 2 years ago when I was on Van Buren and the food was great!!!! What Happened???  We arrived at about 7:45. When we walked in both men were texting on their cell phones and did not really seem to care much about anything else. The person working the counter a tall man of ethnic origin was kind of aloof and on the rude side. I got the BBQ Chicken and my guest got the BBQ Pulled Pork. Total Cost: $19.63 which BTW was a great year. The food was out in 5 minutes so you know a lot of care was taken in the cooking and preparation. The Chicken did not taste fresh. It was soft and moist like it should be but it tasted like a reheat from 2 days past. Presentation was HORRIBLE! My friends pulled pork sandwich was served on a white hamburger bun and the sauce saturated it so much that he could not hold it to eat it. The bun should have at least been toasted.  I was extremely embarrassed as my friend threw more than half of it away.  In the not so distant past I ate at the Honey Bears on Elliot and Priest.  It is close to my home and the food was consistently good and we went every other month. I guess every chain has a BRONZE store and I guess HB's on 5012 E Van Buren St Phoenix, AZ 85008 is the B@$T@RD child of the chain.  My advice....try someplace else where they want your business and serve FRESH food.  I am Jeff and I call em as I see em!  BTW if you are handicapped they have a ramp but the parking lot is so uneven and has course asphalt, it is a major trip/fall hazard.

TOP NOTCH OPERATION!!! My wife uses Dr. Adam B. Alperin. The guy is ACES with a capital A!!! He spends time with patients and answers all questions. This Doc really cares about what he does and how he does it. I have spent a lot of time in a lot of hospitals, medical clinics and research facilities for my job and I know a professional caring Doc when I meet one.  Everyone is always positive in his front office and wait times are never long. I would recommend Southwest Contemporary Women's Care for any woman looking for an Obstetrician or Gynecologist.

Baseline Sew and Vac is FANTASTIC!!!! Raoul is a very nice and knowledgeable man and one heck of a vacuum mechanic. I have sent him my Dyson, Hoover, Bissell Rug Cleaner and a Hoover Floor Mate. He fixed them all and improved the suction for a very reasonable price. This guy is ACES and I would definitely recommend him for all your vacuum cleaner and all small motorized appliances.

Great people to work with! I had Doctor Harion who is a Cornea Specialist. He is EXTREMELY thorough and handles you as a patient the way you would expect from an old country doctor and he cares. I have sent 2 patients to him and bringing my dad with me tomorrow. Dr Harion is ACES!!! I also want to add that Swagel Wootton Hiatt Eye Center doctors always give your eyes a great examination no matter who you go see. Office is clean and nice, never a long wait and easy to get appointments, nice office staff. I would rate this practice an A!

I had my yearly eye exam with Dr. Herion. As always the pre-testing by office staff was superb! The girls really take their time with you and do a thorough examination before the Dr. comes in. Dr. Herion did his exam and found that my reading prescription had increased by .25, I wear progressive transition lenses which tend to be expensive. Dr. Herion was very honest and told me to save my money this year and possibly get new lenses next year. Dr. Herion is not only a GREAT DOC but also HONEST! Kudos to him and his staff at Swagel, Wootton, Hiatt Eye Center 2 years in a row.

This store operates by buying RTM (Return to Manufacturer) Merchandise for pennies on the dollar that companies such as Home Depot, Kohls, Lowes, Sears etc get for returns and instead of sending some items back to the Manufacturer these stores sell the items by the truckload in lots. It then needs to be sorted through by DRL employees and some items can be sold, some items are trashed and some go to the garage sale area. Most items are marked with the problems they have accurately. Some are not.   I recall buying some landscape lighting in the past that turned out to be defective. It was also marked LED but inside the packages were halogen lighting. I returned them in the specified amount of time and was able to exchange them. I also brought in my power supply and tested the rest of their stock as a good will gesture and informed them how they could test lighting in the future so they would not be selling defective lighting.   DRL Outlet also stocks a lot of nice Hardware items that are drastically discounted. I buy a lot of electronic door locks, repair them and resell them or use them on homes of the elderly who have problems using keys due to arthritis.  I am cautious of what I buy because some lock replacement parts are unavailable from manufacturers. This is why carefully labeling the products is very important with what might be missing from the package or what the problem is with a lock set. In the past missing parts and testing results were labeled accurately. Not so much with a lock I purchased a number of weeks ago. It was marked NO KEYS. I took the lock home and the next day I went to a locksmith and ordered cylinder housing. It took close to 5 weeks to get it. When I received the part and I went to install it I found the keypad was totally dead. I had invested another 20 plus dollars into a cylinder and cylinder holder so I brought the lock back to Robert the owner's son who is probably a co-owner of DRL Outlet. I explained my problem and he told me there was nothing he could do. I told him I realize what the policies are of his store but since the product was marked inadequately with the defect / problem, I felt he could rectify the situation since I am a regular customer and do a lot of business with the store. He told me there was" nothing he could do". I felt he could have given me a credit, a refund or better yet, exchanged my unit for something he had on the shelf that at least had a working touch pad since I had already purchased the rest of the parts to get the lock in working order. I guess keeping a good customer happy is not something DRL Outlet cares about. They just care about your $$$ and things are sold with a magnificent tail light warranty meaning once they can't see your tail lights out the parking lot your warranty is over and you are on your own.  Now I don't mean to be petty but this is about scruples and..."The customer is always right. I asked Robert what if I talk to his dad? He replied "My dad can be tougher than me" Well, Toughness aside...... DRL OUTLET has lost my business over a mere $20 item. They have also lost all my relatives, friends, networking group and some church members business from mere pettiness. In this economy people are more careful with their money and want to make sure it is well spent. There are 2 other stores like DRL within a 10 mile radius. They are not as convenient but possibly they will value me and my acquaintances business more. CAVEAT EMPTOR... Buyer Beware.
