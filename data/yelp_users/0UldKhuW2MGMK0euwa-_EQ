High Quality, 'Chipotle' Style Mediterranean Food  This is as good as it gets! Service is always very very friendly and their food is fresh, home-made, vegan/vegetarian, and tasty! I am always impressed by the quality of vegetables and meats, their gyro is some of my favorite, the grilled chicken a close second. Their hummus is a huge bonus, made in house, they typically have 6 different types that rotate. I can't decide which is my favorite they are all unique and delicious. Lemon ginger is fantastic,  you won't find it anywhere else, and the cilantro jalape√±o is great if you like spice. I recommend any of their 3 or 4 different kale salads as well as their spicy ginger carrots. The 'pita' sized plate is more than enough food for one, and is just around $6 or $7. You won't regret going here.

Not consistent, left me ill   For what it's worth I have enjoyed the food I've gotten at Burger Rush. I've been there three times but I won't be returning. The third visit left me with a stomach ache that kept me on the couch or in bed for half the day. This is corroborated by my friend whom I dined with and experienced the same symptoms the next day. (We don't live with one another and that was the only occasion that week when we were together, or ate together) Each visit it seemed as though the food was different, the burgers and the fries, but specifically the fries. (Ranging from soggy, to too much batter, not enough) These three visits to Burger Rush were within the first two months they were open, so I can excuse the inconsistency, but there is no excuse for poor quality food or poorly cooked food that leaves their customers with stomach pains. In addition, I was very disappointed that they didn't have sweet potato tots, which are on the menu but apparently they don't carry them (I've unsuccessfully ordered them three times ha). Service was mediocre, and often took a while to receive your food, specifically for a burger joint with a drive thru. I've waited 20 minutes for two burgers in their drive thru. Overall really disappointed, I live in the neighborhood and have a demand for a burger joint that's open past last call.  On the plus side, after a peek at the other reviews, it doesn't seem as though anyone else has gotten ill from eating at Burger Rush. Could have been isolated, but once is one too many, not taking my chances.

The Normal Diner makes 'normal' exquisite. Features homely, simple meals, cooked to perfection, and presented beautifully. It may just be eggs and potatoes, but it is one of the best variations of eggs and potatoes you can find,  A.K.A. 'The Minimum Wage' breakfast.  Two flawless eggs over easy, crispy potatoes with herbs, spices, and sauteed poblanos add a small kick. Topped off with thick bacon, and toast of your choice. Portions are just right, even for an American restaurant. At first glance it seemed small but by the end of the meal I was left full with little on my plate. My roommate whom I dined with ate a dish with braised beef short rib, that was extremely tender. He even compared it to his mothers own cooking!  The atmosphere and staff made the experience that more pleasant. The restuarants dress is spacious, retro, impeccably clean, and feels like a hodge-podge of decades past, featuring a wall decorated with 8 tracks, and leaving checks attached to dated paperback novels. All of the staff was amiable, and I had a few conversations with some of the waiters. The two waiters I chatted with were ASU students along with the majority of the staff that also appeared rather young. It makes me feel good, knowing I can leave a nice tip, for a waiter who absolutely deserved it, but for a waiter who is also a student. I am currently a graduate student at ASU, and it wasn't that long ago that I remember living off tips from strangers. It pleases me to see Normal Diner employing students, I remember the nightmare of an ihop that preceded Normal Diner. Not only was it bad for an ihop, but their staff was rather crotchety and old, certainly not employing Tempe's younger work force.   Normal Diner, is far from 'normal'. I plan on returning frequently, next time I'll have to try their espresso!  UPDATE: Their espresso is delicious and comes from a big beautiful pink espresso machine
