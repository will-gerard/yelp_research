I've been coming here off & on over the years always the best service! Clean friendly & great mani/pedis!  The owners always remember my name & greet me each time.  Staff is consistent & been there very long term.

Chairs are uncomfortable... The only time they act like they understand  or speak English is when your talking about price & times up for massage.  I liked the cucumber scrub & didn't have to wait long.  Not a bad place to go if in the area but I've been to a lot better.

My husband & I went for here last Sunday night for a celebratory dinner.  We went off of serveral reccomendations from friends as to the Best Seafood & Steak!  We had reservations for 7:30 got right in.  Tables are WAY to close together!  For a fine dinning experience and the romance factor this was not ideal.  I got to hear all about what was going on whose check during the course of my neighbering table.  We order cocktails and to my surprise they came out in what I would call "kids cups" very tiny!  We ordered crab cakes for the appetizer.  In which I love crab however these had no flavor at all I didn't even finish it.  The salads we ok garden salad nothing special.  I did however like the tarragon dressing that was served.  For our Entrees my husband had a baked lobster to which he said was ok.  The Lobster meat was very sweet but again fell flat on the seasonings.  I had the King Crab legs and filet.  I loved the krab leg (just 1) but the steak was terrible so much so that I had it wrapped up to take home for the dogs.  For desert we had the chocolate lava cake.  I don't think it's prepared there seemed pre made.  The sauce was amazing though.  OK.. The service however was AMAZING!!  Our female waitress was always attentive, timing was good on all food delivery, she even went ahead and wrote congratulations on the desert plate at my request for our celebration (not something they usually do)  Atmasphere 2 1/2 Stars Food 1 1/2 Stars Service 5 Stars

I like to grab curbside once in awhile thought I would tonight... No parking ... food not ready didn't even know where my food ticket was.. Oh did I mention 20 min later I'm still waiting!? What... Very disappointed! Will not be coming back to this location for curbside again! Fail Carrabbas & shame on you for not even apologizing or attempting to make it right

When approached by the owner of the company to utilize the dry cleaning service myself and the rest of the staff where I work were pretty excited.  They were willing to match the price of our cleaners we had been using across the street & pick up and deliver.  We did this about 3 times no problems.  Then our regular Thursday pick did not happen.  When I called the pick up girl came Friday and scolded me telling me she didn't go home the night before and that's when she picks us up.  She said we would've still gotten picked up and returned same day.  Great communication would be nice.  Then one of the staff were over charged next time double bill and didn't even have a dry cleaning order & to top it off we were never picked up again last week.  Of course with no communication & this time no returned phone calls as well.  Even left a voice mail for the owner with no returned call.  Guess we are off the route! Will not be using this service again!! Even worse they have my credit card on file in which I will have to cancel.   Not worth the hassle!

Chose Zinburger to enjoy lunch with a friend on the patio & take in the cooler temps.  Man were we disappointed!! Let me start by saying the place wasn't even a little bit busy.  3 tables including ours in the patio.  Waited 10+ minutes before I went & tract down a waitress.  Decided better make the most of the visit we ordered drinks food all at once.  We ordered sweet potato fries.  When asked if we would like those to come out first we replied yes.  Drinks came relatively quickly &&& then the wait.  Finally all the food came at once.  ?? Whatever we were starving.  My burger was missing the bacon & had onions of which I request otherwise.  The boy that dropped off the food (still hadn't seen the waitress since drinks were dropped off) he left so quickly I caught him to ask for mustard & ranch.  No one came back until the original girl I flagged down came to check I mentioned the onions and the no bacon which I could have lived without but the onions were a deal breaker.  She offered to have it remade I was hesitant because I was so hungry but she assured me it would be quick.  My friend was almost done with her bun less double double that she requested with the trimmings and condiments that came with nothing.  She didn't mention it to the waitress because when she finally came back what was the point she was almost done.  The burger came back ... 10 min or so later by the manager who Said so sorry.  I again asked for mustard that had never come.   I dipped I to my BBQ sauce and found a hard thing like a twig... Happened to be a shaving off the toothpick that holds the buns together is what the waitress explained.   After I removed my burnt bun & pulled the twig out of my BBQ I continues to eat my dry burger when my mustard arrived half way through.... In the end  the waitress said we comp'd your burger just because we thought we'd be nice!   Really...really???  First & last visit!
