If you are looking for Authentic Mexican Food this is your place.  Don't judge this place from the exterior view, once you get inside it is well lit, well air conditioned and great space.   The service was great, quick, efficient and genuine.    The salsa and pico were amazing, the best in town.  I had the chicken chimi with red sauce and rice and beans.  It was perfect! Couldn't beat it! perfect flavors and perfect spice.    Great value for priced paid as well.  They have great lunch special and better happy hour specials.  I will be back!

WOW!!!!  This place has really lost it's touch.  I remember the days when my friends and I would celebrate eating here. Now I doubt I will be back.  I came here and experienced and witness some of the worst service.  What made it worse was the fact that my pork sandwhich was dry as hell.    The only reasons I am leaving 2 stars is because of the fond memories I had of honey bears back in the early 2000's and the fact that their sauce is still amazing. Other than that I won't be back.

Just stopped by here quickly today to grab some food to go for my grandmother. She loves this place! I was greeted warmly by Norma the hostess who quickly helped me get my grandmas order on the way.   When I went to the bar to pay a very kind lady with pig tails asked if I wanted to have a seat and enjoy some water or tea as I waited. I politely declined but was very grateful that she asked. Between her and the hostess my quick trip to Mimi's was great and because of their service I will be back to dine in with them in the near future.   Thank you lovely folks at Mimi's.

Pita is amazing.  It is one of those places that you discover and are slightly upset that it took you so long to find it.  Now i feel the need to eat here as much as possible just to catch up!  Food amazing! All of it. Hummus(s), Tzatziki, Gyro, Quesadilla, salads and all of the above.   There service is always spot on the last time I was there Macie was our server and she was fantastic.  Very efficient, checked on us, kept our glasses full but overall was just very pleasant and kind.    The atmosphere here is great.  They have great outdoor seating.  They stay fairly busy so it can be a bit loud at time.  Nothing that bothers me but people more sensitive to sound for sure.    I will be back many many many more times.  Learn from my lesson, don't waste time not eating here.

I was wondering why this Best Buy had such a low rating and now I see why.  Lets start with the good.   Pros -Clean/Organized store -Was offered help by a yonng man while searching for a CD.  I refused his assistance but I greatly appreciated his offer.    Cons -Poor service -Was not greeted upon entering store even though there was an employee on hand.  He looked at me as I walked in and looked away without even acknowledging my presence -Multiple employees around but come time to checkout there was not a body to be found -Stood in the checkout line ass one of the employees helped a customer.  He looked up and let me know that someone would be over shortly.  3 minutes later I was still standing in line waiting.  Keep in mind I must have been one of 8 customers in the store.  It was not busy at all.  I almost put my purchase back on the store and left before another gentleman came out to help.  He failed to even acknowledge my wait (no apology, nor a thank you for my patience)    Long story short.  I find it unacceptable to not be greeted when your store is dead slow.  I find it unacceptable to stand in line while employees mingle with each other.   I work in the service industry.  This was by far my worst Best Buy experience ever.  For the sake of the employees future I hope management coaches their employees on how to properly work within their job responsibilities. They might not last anywhere else.  Please don't set them up to fail in their future endeavors.

It had been a while since I've eaten at Z'Tejas.  Decided to meet up with a friend and have a good Margarita and a bite or two.   Overall it was an excellent experience.  Service -Amazing from being greeted at the door to our amazing server Missy.  She is amazing at what she does.  So amazing that I am writting this review a month later after finding my receipt.  She had amazing recommendations and I ran with them, every item she recommended what amazing.  It obvious she's knowledgeable about the menu and knows how to ask the right questions to provide the perfect recommendation.  One of the best experiences I have had with a server and I eat out tons.  Food -Seasoned well, perfect amount of spice to it. -Looked good and came out hot instead of looking like it had been under a heat lamp and coming out with the "I've been sitting under a heat lamp look"   My Marg was on point!   Atmosphere -Busy, a bit loud but not unbearable.  It was what was to be expected during Happy Hour. -Clean, tables being bused in a timely manner -Clean Restrooms.  Overall I will make sure not to wait so long to come visit again.  I hope to have the pleasure of being served by Missy again as well.

The ladies here are amazing.  Very kind, professional and efficient.    I came here to get a heem let loose on a pair of suit pants that were a bit to high on Thursday morning.  I was flying out of town for 3 weeks on business and needed to have them by Monday afternoon.  They were able to get this completed for me at no extra charge.   The prices are very reasonable and you will receive great service here.  I will be bringing all of my business here moving forward.   **Keep in mind that this is a cash only business**

I don't normally do Einsteins outside of this location but this location keeps my business with their great employees and amazing service.  Their food and coffee always meets expectations as well.   I have only had one bad experience where both of my bagel sandwiches were wrong.  Appearently I got the guy who ordered before me meal.  I didn't realize it until I drove home.  Luckily I live 2 minutes away.  I drove back and they were able to correct the situation and were great about it.  No compensation was offered, but it wasn't a big enough inconvenience to me for me to need or want compensation.  Other might be different.    I have also had enough positive experiences with this location to know that they are always on their game and mistakes do happen.    I appreciate them handling my issues in a timely manner and their sincere apology.   I will be returning when I get back into town.

Not sure how I was unaware of this little gem located in the corner of a plaza that I visit so often.  Luckily my grandmother was.  I came here early on a Monday morning to find a clean, well kept small croissant shop.  I picked up 3 items.  Chicken Quiche- Amazing! Had to fight my dad for the last bite. Peanut Butter Croissant- Didnt get to try as it was demolished by a friend Regular Croissant- As good as it gets.  Great staple.   Long story short give this place a shot.  You will not regret supporting this small, local business.    I will for sure be returning next time I am in town.

Piestewa Peak might be one of my favorite hikes.   It is the perfect any day of the week hike but you note that Saturday/Sundays will get packed.  Good luck finding parking.  Not impossible but can be somewhat challenging for sure.    At the peak there will be a lot of people but there is plenty of areas to sit and hang out and take good picture or just enjoy the view.    Don't let this hike scare you, there are many of ages making this hike.  You can make it a bit more challenging by picking up your paste if you feel that the hiking isn't challenging enough.   Hike responsibly, drink water, pick up your trash and share a smile with those that walk by.  More importantly, enjoy yourself.

You can't go wrong with D'lish.    Lines can be outrageously long but it is worth it every time.  The inside is a bit tight but very doable.    Everything on the menu will leave you satisfied.   There is nothing like a breakfast buzz after a solid work out!

I can't get enough of Some Burros!  I travel often for work and am only one one a couple days a month and during those couple days my diet consist of Some Burros.  If you haven't had their Pollo Fundido then stop wasting your time and try it.  I usually ask them to give me half rice and beans instead of a full portion of one or the other.    I have to admit the last time I was here their salsa was a bit off.  I didn't taste the same.  it was disappointing considering that if I could I would drink it straight from the bottle.   Seriously though, come in, sit down and enjoy some great Mexican food.

This spot is my favorite quick mexican food spot in all of AZ.    Pretty much anything you get here will be good.  Their salsa is on point too!   Stop in, they are quick.  You will be in and out.

You can't go wrong with Kokomo.  They are consistently good.   Great product, great toppings at great prices.    You will never find this place empty.  They have some outdoor seating which is perfect for the cooler nights.   I only hope the employees enjoy working there.  They never seem too happy or friendly.  Other than that, stop reading this and go!

I must say that I really enjoy coming here.    The lovely staff that works here are very friendly and have helped me put together some amazing arrangements that my girlfriend have absolutely loved.  I am a fan of putting together my own arrangements instead of purchasing the pre-made arrangements.  I enjoy adding my personal touch.    Their flowers are great in quality and are always fresh, always bright and always in good shape.    I greatly appreciate the ladies here who assist me and look forward to coming back many more times.   Thank you!

Shout out to Salty Sow for an amazing experience.  My colleagues and I met up for happy hour here and we left feeling satisfied with the amazing food and great service.   Service-  Amazing and attentive service! I wish I could remember the individuals name who provided service but he was very easy going, gave great recommendations and kept the refills going of both water and drinks.    Food- All around amazing. All of the dishes were fantastic.   Truffled Deviled Eggs- If you like deviled eggs make sure to get them... If you don't like deviled eggs.. Get them! You will love them. Duck Fat Fries- Duck Fat and Fries.... Nothing else really needs to be said.   Honey Rosemary Dipped Fried Chicken- Man ol man.  This dish was phenomenal.  The chicken is very well done and biscuit.. perfect.  French Dip-Roated Rare- If you enjoy the combo of prime rib, horseradish and au ju then you will love this meal.  Perfect spice, and flavors.  White Corn Cheese Grits-  Great side dish.  Big enough to share with quite a few. Fried Green Tomatoes-  Solid sharing dish for those who want to be semi Healthy  Drinks- All were great! Between the 3 of us we tried the Maple Glazed Old Fashion, Little Larry, Copper State Mule, Mr Shaw and the Petey.  I would have to give the nod to the Mr. Shaw.  Atmosphere-  Lively, busy, fun and slightly loud when it picks up.  Comfortable seating, great lighting, anything and everything you could ask for.   This may become my new happy hour spot.

Came here one day after a work out with a buddy of mine.    A young lady was assisting someone when we arrived and she let us know she would be with us shortly.  Shortly turned a bit long.  We ordered two protein shakes.   Unfortunately the lady who rang us up was unable to do so due to their CC machine being down.  We waiting about 15 min before we were able to charge the card.  Finally $20.00 later $10.00 per shake and 30 min later  we received our shakes.  I enjoyed mine, my buddy not so much.  Also, we were charged for chia seeds and neither one of us ever got them in our shakes.   I doubt I will come back.  Not worth the wait, nor the value paid for the (Chia Seedless) protein shake in my opinion.

Snooze! How amazing you are!  Lines are long but food is worth it.  Hopefully you can catch one of the communal tables and skip the wait.   Food was phenomenal! All. Of. It!    We had the OMG French Toast, Scramble, with the pancake of the day (Smores) and a couple Mimosas.  The OMG French Toast was stupid good! Everything you hear and more.  The pancake was on the same level. The Scramble was good but took a major back seat to the other items.  Service was solid too.  We had a really good sever.  Philip was his name.  He was very efficient, very nice and gave solid recommendations.  For as busy as they were he did an amazing job holding down all of his tables.   The place has a great vibe to it, busy and bustling but stayed clean and under control.    You get a bang for your buck for sure.  You pay for good food but you aren't giving an arm or a leg.

Original ChopShop Co. has gained a big fan.  Love this place, both the one in Tempe and Chandler.  Must haves are the Sprouted Grain Bagel Sandwich, Sunrise Wrap.  Last but definitely not least is the Jacked Up PB&J.    Don't debate going just go and treat your body to healthy flavorful and fulfilling experience.

IMO there is nothing better than a beautiful early morning hike.  Cholla trail definitely delivered.  The degree of difficulty will vary obviously depending on your hiking experience, fitness level and personal preference of which type of hike you enjoy.   With that being said, I don't believe Cholla Trail is easier than Echo Canyon.  The hike is could be considered easier if you stop at the heli pad.  If you continue to the top of the summit where Echo Canyon and Cholla meet then it is significantly more challenging.    Echo Canyon is no walk in the park but I would recommend it over the Cholla Trail for those new to hiking or not as experienced.

Shout out to ATL Wings for having the best wings in PHX!    Regardless of whatever flavor you get make sure you try the ATL Style.  These had to be some of the best wings I have ever had.  The fries are solid with some of their dipping sauces too.  Last but not least the honey biscuits are dangerous but so damn good.   I haven't Kool-Aid in years.  Talk about bring back some memories!   Over all it is a solid spot and you can't go wrong with it.   The owner Mike is a real cool and humble guy.  You can't go wrong supporting a business with owners like that.    I will be back many more times!

This Smashburger does it well.  They have friendly employees and the establishment is kept clean.  I was helped by a gentleman named Corey who was great.  The food came out hot and tasted amazing!   The only thing I found to be disappointing is that if you start to place your order before putting in your phone number for Smashpoints you will not receive credit, even if you haven't paid yet.  Glad I know now.  I will be back.
