Can't get enough of this place, especially on a Friday night when the Mariachi's are there.  I get the same plate every time and never have any complaints - Grilled Fish Culichi!  Best Micheladas in town too!  BTW, check in on Yelp and you get a FREE slice of cake!

Brought my iPad in to see why I wasn't able to get WiFi and the staff was quick to assist! As always the store is packed, but they are always readily available to help and direct you to the right department or person...Told me they would have the problem solved in 20 minutes - with plenty of stores close-by I was able to get a quick bite to eat while waiting!  I also had to return an iPad case, which by the way was with out a receipt and past the return date, but with my credit card they were able to locate my purchase and return the charge to my card!   Mychael B (one of the Managers) assisted me, but everyone else seemed to be so willing to help me when he stepped away.

This is one of my favorite breakfast spots. You get quick-kind service...even on the busy weekend mornings.   You'll never go wrong with their whole wheat pancakes! Ask them to mix in some bananas, walnuts, blueberries and oatmeal & you'll be all set!

Rude!   Customer service starts off great when you first pull up, that is UNTIL you tell them you're not interested in their detail or windshield replacement - demeanor totally changed after that.   Pricing is decent, if they did a good job.  Somehow, they forgot to vacuum behind the driver and passenger seats and when I mentioned it to them - they weren't too happy about it, told me...."That's why we recommended the detail" NEXT!

I am in love with my new backyard... and CA Pools and Landscaping!   From complete dirt (litterally) to a colorful masterpiece!  Who would have thought that some trees, plants, lighting and turf would make me want to hang out in 100 (plus) degree weather.    The entire job took two days.  The crews were in and out and were very respectful and clean.  I would highly recommend  CA Pools not only for your pool, but for your landscaping remodeling needs!

Save yourself the trip! Avoid this place!   What ever happened to shaking on a final dollar amount?  Shook on a dollar amount with the Desk Manager and after waiting around for two hours; after signing all the paperwork We met with the Finance manager.   The numbers didn't sound right so we asked for a breakdown.  Come to find out, they added a lot of "optional" charges that we didn't ask for or need.  Once we had him remove those charges they didn't want to take the deal anymore - EVEN after we told them we'd pay cash!  So disappointing - I will not be referring any prospects their way, but I will be telling EVERYONE I know about this situation.

All I gotta say is...Tina ROCKS!   I'm always super nervous about where I get my hair cut.  I have long hair and it's all too risky to just drop into any salon and get a "trim", but after getting referred to Blossom and talking with Tina, I knew I was in good hands! Great personality - put me to sleep during my blow out!   I absolutely LOVE my hair...definitely found my new spot and my new hair stylist! might I add...the salon is the CUTEST - Nice little boutique with a ton of cute accessories and  summer dresses! love it!   Highly recommended...forgot to mention GREAT price for a GREAT cut!

My husband and I stopped by to have dinner last night and OMG! the food and service was DELICIOUS! It was a late dinner so wasn't until 9 that we dropped in, but I'll tell you this...the food in the buffet was still fresh and great! They even brought us out from fresh chicken masala off the grill with some nice sauteed onions!   Gotta try it out if you haven't done so already! and if you have been there -see you there!

Whenever I'm having a bad week or just need some time to relax and loosen up - This is the place that comes to mind!   David does such a GREAT job and remembers exactly how I like it! A couple of times I went and had others give me a massage, but it wasn't the same.    Clean is my thing when it comes to massages - and they are definitely clean.  Light music and low lighting..never fails - I always fall asleep.  Be sure and ask for the 1st timers discount rate!

Best service  yet! Came here for a "basic" car wash and fell in love with the place! FREE Wifi and (2) computers, video games for kids (no charge) FREE fresh popcorn, plenty of clean-comfy couches and (5) flatscreen TV's too! Not to mention, it's VERY clean inside.  Car washes are quick and they a GREAT job! Let them know you're a Yelper and you get 1 month FREE of unlimited car washes.  I just resigned for my second month - $29.99 ulimited washes for a month - In the area STOP BY - Best/quickest car wash ever!

Love the food (especially their fresh OJ and pancakes) and the service, but felt the music was a little too loud at this location for a Sunday morning breakfast.  If you're looking for a more quiet breakfast or brunch, I would just go to their other location in Phoenix.  The Phoenix location seems to have a better shaded area in their patio too!
