Love this place.  Great Service and great food!! UFC Fans $5 fights..   Update as of 8-25-13.  Service is worse not by fault of staff they are over worked most nights and understaffed.   quality of food has dropped to just ok 3 stars

Food was bland.. service terrible..  I get better service at McDonald's..  our waitress was to busy to be bothered to stop her conversations with her friends to check on us.. and she couldn't care less when the food wasn't satisfactory... Hostess didn't if inquire about our visit.. will not be back..
