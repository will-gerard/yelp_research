Los Burritos has excellent Mexican food. It's authentic, great tasting, and at a reasonable price.   This family run businesses will deliver tasty food every time without fail. So far I've ordered the burrito de carne asada and the burrito de pollo, each have been great! Just realize that they typically come with rice and beans in them, ask if you don't want them added in there .   They definitely take pride in the place, it's nice to see pictures of the family inside the restaurant itself. Definitely recommend this place!

Before going in today for the first time, I called ahead explaining that I had heard about the place from a friend, and wanted to know if Keep it Cut was good with short hair and if and specific person was very good with fades. I called ahead because I know from years of experience, not everyone can do a good fade. He assured me that everyone was good so I decided to check the place out.   The layout, theme, and premise behind the place is great. I immediately liked the atmosphere of the place. It felt like a mix between a barber shop, salon, and fun garage. The stylist that cut my hair was very sociable and seemed to know what she was doing.   Once the haircut was completed, she did the standard procedure of getting as much loose hair off as possible, but failed to really show me with the small mirror all of the angles of the haircut. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and didn't make a fuss. It wasn't until I got home and really checked out the haircut, that I realized the fade she had given me was not blended, I and my fianc√© could actually see where the hair transitioned to the next length. The fade should be smooth and not visible. I also noticed that there's an indent in the side of my head from where she must have angled the clipper too sharply.   I signed up for a month, but before and if  I go back.. Does anyone know of a barber at this shop that can do a nice, clean fade?   Idea behind the plane is excellent, but from what I've seen so far, this is good of you style your hair a little longer, wouldn't recommend for short hair!

The excellent customer service convinced me to go back and see if they could make my hair look the way I had originally expected. Both the manager and owner reached out to me to make things right.   I went back, Sarah was able to fix the previous cut and transformed a haircut I was not proud to walk around with, to a cut that I felt happy to have. She is knowledgable about the different cuts, a goof fade, different hair textures, and kept me entertained the entire time I was in her chair.   From what I've heard, read from others: Sarah and Mari are the best with fades, but I do believe all the stylists are talented.    I am happy with my cut the second time around and am hopeful that my third will be my favorite. Definitely giving them the chance to keep my business.
