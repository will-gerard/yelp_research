Me and my husband went here to celebrate our big move to Arizona. It was absolutely amazing, we got a romantic package and they came to our table to take a picture.

Okay... I feel bad b/c I see a lot of great reviews for this place but honestly, I had the worst experience ever here, so I'm giving this  a straight up 1 star.    Let me make a few things clear before I get started:   1. I arrived before the lunch rush...way before the lunch rush, I was like the 1st person in the restaurant 2. I was meeting friends there for a brunch/networking thing, it was four of us all together 3. The bad experience started after I tipped... as most bad experience do  The food was okay, I had an omelet which was decent.. but it's hard to beat Fez's egg white omelets in my heart. But the omelet was okay, the atmosphere and decor was amazing, the service was exactly what you expect as a customer.....  Then right when I put in my mental to-do list to give this place 4 to 5 stars on yelp the waiter comes and tells us, after we tipped, that the table we had was for "someone special" (who by the way didn't have a reservation) and we had to leave.... wtf?   How do you tell paying customers and good tippers that they need to leave before the ink even dries on the receipts?  We were pretty upset and asked to speak to the manager, who wasn't present, but the acting manager basically gave us the boot as well.   First time ever I was asked to leave a restaurant....

I had so much fun here... the drinks were really good and the atmosphere was upscale.  I definitely think the music could be a little better though... they tend to play the same things over and over again.  But other than that it was great.

YUMMMM! I loved the old school ice cream parlor look.  It makes you feel like you are in the heart of old town and have disappeared for a second.  The hardest part... choosing a item on the menu.  The staff was really great too and there is reservations for groups.

I must be the only person not giving this place a 5. I went here because of the reviews and I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure if this is because my taste buds are different or I went on a bad day?   I went here for my birthday in April of this year and the food was disgusting....to me. I tried something from "raw food" menu and my husband tried an Ethiopian meal.   This was the worst food I ever had in my life. If I could give this place a zero I would. Again, I was going to try something new, and I think that maybe, I'm just not into Ethiopian or raw food? I'm going to try another Ethiopian restaurant in the future and see if its just me or if it was The Blue Nile.   But yeah....ill never go here again. After a few bites of everything, we didn't touch our food and basically wasted money.  We ended up canceling desert, tipping really good because the waiter was amazing...but leaving without a to-go box.

I came here for the Pink House Treasure's fashion show and I absolutely loved the DJ.  I also loved the outdoor patio... it was cute, cozy, and had these hip white sofas that you could sit on and look up to see the stars.    AZ central was there taking pictures and there was an on site photographer who took pics and uploaded them to the flat screens around the club so you could see what was going on.  All in all a great night!

Best Thai food I ever had. If you haven't tried this place yet...you really are missing out...its that good!!  I ate from the dinner menu and had the Thai barbeque classic, my stepdaughter had Thai fried rice  (she's 9 and very picky) and my friend had one of the Pad entrees. For an appetizer we had the Golden curry puffs. Because of the way the food is served, we were able to share everything.  Everything, and I mean everything, was delicious! I can't wait to go again. No one in my party had any complaints all you could hear was "hmm" "so good"...etc.

Great art, lovely statues.  I loved the bronze Einstein and finger statues, the art was beautiful, fun, young, and funky.   I also liked the workers, they were very informative but in a laid back type of way.

I went into this UPS to ship my package and the service was great when they were getting my money. However,  I had a situation where the package had to be shipped back a few days later so the UPS store out of town had to ship it back to the store it came from. When I went to pick up the package the owner was RUDE and treated me like I was a child. She insisted that I was crazy and that the package could not be delivered there. I was in shock when she started to talk to me slowly like a child explaining how "shipping" works!  The funny part, sure enough, my package was delivered there and I had to keep calling to make sure it was not sent back. The issue wasn't really the package situation but the customer service....don't be rude and uppity. Plus she charged me $5 to pick up the package from her store saying it was a "private location". WTH?? its UPS..the least private place in the world.  Anyway, I would have gladly paid for any error on my part if the customer service was good. She threw the package on the counter when it was picked up...there was a laptop in there! This UPS store has turned me into a FedEx customer. I am sooo fed up with bad customer service!!

1st..downtown Mesa needs to get its props. They have some really good places to check out and Mango's is one of them.  Mangos is one of my favorite Mexican food stops. I love their taco salads because their tacos are homemade and soooo delish.   I also love their 100% fruit juices, so simple and so good. You gotta get there before the lunch crowd if you want some though, they run out super fast.   Simple, Delish, and fun.  Oh....and here's a lil inside hint, going to the bathroom there is an adventure on its own....

Where do I start?  As a shopper, writer and publicist I love Pink House.  Danica, the owner, is amazing.  We used her apparel on a few morning show segments for our models and fell in love with her store.   The staff is laid back and friendly, the store decor is fun and flirty and the apparel is trendy and affordable. Some jewelry and shoes are pricey, but you won't see anyone else wearing it, so its worth the price. Basically, you can find an affordable outfit and a unique piece all in the same place.  My favorite part of Pink House is the home decor items placed throughout the store. From unique decor accessories to full sized eclectic furniture...its definitely worth the visit.   Unfortunately, Pink House is sooo far from where I live, but when I am close I always stop by.

Excellent! I'm a starbucks junkie and I was looking for a place to stop and dink coffee in Mesa while I waited to go to work.  Talk about a score.    First off, the bagels are 99cents and they are really good, secondly the wifi is free so I was able to browse the internet without hassle, third, the small coffee was like $1.39, and fourth the decor is nice and they have a flat screen tv so you can get the news while you sit.     The location is downtown Mesa so it has that historical feel.  They also serve breakfast and open at 7am.  Compare that to the money I used to waste at Starbucks every morning and you just can't beat it.

Oh.. my... God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!!! I live bike riding distance from Mekong  so during my workout one day I was like, hmm.. let me see what this is. **mouth hits floor** Fresh seafood in a market layout. They are swimming in the tank. Fresh fruits and exotic vegetables, AWESOME Asian trinkets. 4 years here and never knew. I'm giving this 5 stars because not only will this save me from going to wally world for disgusting fruits and veggies when i don't feel like driving far, but also because its a diverse unique and clean market with a really cool vibe. Nuff said... lol.

I  think your review of this place depends on what you order. The menu is very very random. I ordered the fish and chips and it was really good. The fish was cut in large generous square pieces and cooked throughly. The seasoning was only on the batter but the quality of the fish was so good that you didn't even notice. The fries were hot and fresh and the service was amazing.   Why did I give this place a 4 instead of a 5? The water was sooo gross. If you are going to serve water in a restaurant please use a filter, because faucet water is not good and it has an obvious taste. When I told the waiter about the water she look "appalled" and said "its filtered". I politely just ordered some apple juice, which she didn't charge me for.   Hopefully they invest in a quality water filter. Other than that I thought the food I ordered was great and the service was really nice.

So I broke my glasses on my hike today, went to get them fixed, and found out my warranty had just expired. Thankfully the technician recommended these guys. They showed up to my door with a mobile repair lab/van and fixed the hinge in 15 minutes. Amazing, fast, convenient and excellent service.
