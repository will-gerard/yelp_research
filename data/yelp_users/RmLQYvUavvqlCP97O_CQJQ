We went to Try Me Bicycle Shop for Small Business Saturday and it was everything we needed. We tried one other local bike shop before going there and was so happy we chose to purchase from Try Me. Jeff helped us and was so knowledgeable and accommodating - He even installed our bike rack onto our car.

Went to coach house in December for a friends going away party and had a blast. It's AWESOME around Christmas with all the gaudy lights. The bartender drew?? I think?? Created a shot called a wineski and I drank wayyy to many, but still had a blast. It reminds me of an old divey bar I went to in college except with no college kids puking, and I don't feel like I will catch hepatitis in the bathroom. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it's sooooo crowded (good for business?) bad for ease of getting drinks. The staff is great and super friendly!!!!

This club was okay. We had a table and bottle service, outside of the dance floor/club area by the fountain. The way it was set up made it difficult to get in and out of table if we needed to use the restroom or wanted to dance. This is not the reason the club was just okay...The DJ playing on Saturday wasn't great, until the very last song (R Kelly "bump n grind"), as we were walking out haha. The worst part about the night was that the place was CRAWLING with very "thirsty" men. I mean we could barely walk through the club to the restroom without being cat called or groped. Obviously this isn't the club's fault, just a "beware for the ladies." Overall I wouldn't say this is the worst place I've been in Vegas, but not the best either. Give it a shot if you're staying in the Wynn or Encore and don't want to venture too far from your room.

Dr. Liu and his staff make going to the dentist easy and stress free. I've never had much of an "issue" with visiting the dentist; however I am new to Arizona and had to find all new doctors. I knew from my first visit that I wasn't going to have to find another dentist. After my first cleaning, I had to do a follow up to fill a cavity. It was so painless and easy, I even fell asleep a few times throughout the process. I'd recommend Dr. Liu to anyone who needs a new dentist in the Phoenix, Scottsdale or Tempe area.

Dolly Rockers Salon makes your feel instantly hip. The decorations are to dye for (haha get it) and everyone that works there is so friendly and well dressed. I've seeen Drea about 5 times now and have referred her to 3 other people (all who LOVE her just as much as I do). She does a wonderful job analyzing exactly what you want and what fits your face. Her dye jobs are exactly what I've been looking for. The best thing about dolly rockers is that they are good for someone of any age because everyone there really knows what they are doing. I'd highly recommend it!

Horrible. Sub par job. Paid for a pedi and got lotion rubbed on my legs and bad paint job on my toes. The nail polish didn't even last a week, and the customer service was not great. The price was ridiculous for what they did.

I've been to Vegas again since eating at STK and honestly it's all I thought about the whole time. Since Vegas has so many options, I hate going to the same place twice. I have this guilty feeling that I'm missing out on something, however this time around, I'm genuinely pissed at myself.  STK is perfect for a late meal before clubbing, or for a lively group of people that don't mind eating dinner in a loud atmosphere. We walk in and the place was jamming. They had a DJ spinning AWESOME 90's R&B and Rap and all the servers were on their A game. The food was fresh, delicious and came out promptly - but not so fast where you think it's not being cooked for you.  The coolest part about STK is going to the kitchen and seeing the chef's line with their amazing view. The chefs are having just as much fun as all of the guests. I'd highly recommend STK and will absolutely be visiting my next time in Vegas.

Absolutely, hands down, one of the best live shows I've ever seen. The venue is perfect; small, intimate and sounds great. I highly advise drinking BEFORE you go considering its 13 dollars for a solo cup of margarita. The boyz sound great. I was impressed with how personable and funny they were in between songs. MEN: take your lady, it will definitely get you laid :)

Wave has a high rating for a reason. After having a quite terrific nye party my house was destroyed I cleaned it twice since but it never was clean enough. We hired wave and two women showed up with all of the supplies and went to town. They were friendly and thorough. We will definitely call wave again.

The food was great and the service was better. It's cheaper which is perfect for a casual date night or dinner with friends. The meals are easily shared and the pizza is definitely made to order. Our server Melissa was so great I asked to speak with her manager. She was patient, quick, easy going and nice. I will definitely go again.

Luncha Libre and I started off with a rocky relationship. Every thursday my office has food trucks outside. Of course I went during their busiest hour (noon), but having to wait 30 minutes for a quesadilla seems a little insane. Once I received my food I was so very impressed. I had the papa verde with no protein. IT WAS AWESOME! I imagine if I were a vegetarian, this is as close to food heaven there is. The luncharita in the mason jar is just too cute (and delicious). I was also super impressed with the side of tortilla chips. Normally most places give you super bland, almost stale tortilla chips, but there's were perfectly salted and great with the pico. 12 bucks overall, and I get to keep a 32oz mason jar - I'd call this a win! Just speed up the service homies!

I took my old iphone in yesterday to have it repaired, not only was the customer service fantastic, but they're way cheaper than their competitors. I walked in 15 minutes before close (most businesses give you the cold shoulder when you do that) they were so friendly and willing to help. I'll definitely be using them again. Good job guys!

Brat haus is set up great. The big patio with the big tables makes it comfortable and great for a large party. I went to Brat Haus for a friend's birthday who is a beer fanatic; it was perfect in that sense. The server asked perfect questions to know exactly what kind of beer we would like, and made great recommendations. The food to me was so-so. I like sausage just fine, I just wasn't a huge fan of the toppings. I ordered the brat sliders, which came with a sample of 3 brat's with 3 different toppings. I was disappointed. The saving grace for Brat Haus in my eyes was their hot pretzels with cheese (AMAZING), beer and the "hush hush sauce." I also ate a few French fries whom a friend had ordered and they were good. I'd highly recommend this place for a casual dinner, birthday party, or for someone who loves German beer. The prices are great too!

I think this Vegas trip was just mediocre all around. We ate at Allegro on Friday night around 8:30. The best part about this restaurant was that we didn't have to wait. The drinks are overprice - as is everything in Vegas, and the food was just okay. I ordered a wood-fire pizza (again almost 30 dollars for about 6 slices of cheese pizza is INSANE), and it was good, not great. My friend ordered the bruschetta app and it looked AMAZING. It had fresh mozzarella, balsamic, arugula, the whole nine yards and was probably worth the price. Another friend with a food allergy ordered just a salad, but they took her food allergies very seriously - which was reassuring. My drink was off of the cocktail menu and I was pleasantly surprised with how strong it was considering I was paying 17 dollars for it.  Overall, if you need something quick and sort of nice and you don't want to leave the Wynn, this is your place, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.

I don't know how anyone can give this show less than 5 stars.  First and foremost, if you can get away without planning things in advanced, I'd recommend trying to get tickets the day of.  Well that's what we did anyway. They were highly discounted and then we were double upgraded because the show didn't sell out. We essentially paid less than half price for the seats we sat in, which was awesome.  Regardless, after seeing the show, I probably would still pay full price. It was exceptional. The actors came out in full costume before the show and interacted with the audience. The music was executed perfectly for each act and the audience participation throughout the show kept you awake and engaged (you know, if people jumping on tight ropes didn't already do that). I would absolutely recommend this show to a friend or family member, and will 100% see it again if I have the chance.

Dutch Bro's coffee is amazing, not burnt like Starbucks, or watered down. The drinks are fresh to order and their stamp card system is amazing if you're a regular. The staff is super up beat, polite and they always have awesome music rockin. I recommend the skinny carmalizer, hot. It doesn't taste too different from the original with less calories. I'm so sad i'm moving away from this location, but will probably go out of my way to stop by once in a while. Great coffee, but even better people!

What great service. Our waitress Christie was on top of it. It was our first time at any Blanco location, not only did she take the time to go over the menu, she was made aware that one of us had a glutten allergy and educated us on what options would best suit our needs. She was timely, friendly and up beat.   The restaurant itself seemed great. We chose to sit outside and enjoyed happy hour margaritas (what a great value). We both had street tacos, I had the "Award winning" bbq beef and my partner had the fish. We both thought our dishes were great. The side of street corn was absolutely to die for.   Of course it being a Sam Fox restaurant the decor was lovely and everyone was super hip. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for great service, contemporary mexican and a great margarita.

We went to 10 a few weeks ago and were BLOWN away. Not only was the service awesome (our server KAT was awesome), but the chef even came out to ask about our meal and the service. If you want the best pot roast and cooked carrots in the valley - this is the place! The hush puppies were AWESOME as well. It was a tad pricey, but well worth the money! I DEFINITELY will visit again!
