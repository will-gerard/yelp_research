Best car buying experience ever thanks to Lou Gordon, love the new GLK 350! I have purchased a lot of vehicles and this was by far the best experience yet, top notch performance by all involved and one of the most attractive dealerships you could ever want to enter and be sure to visit the in house cafe, nice touch.

I have been coming here for lunch weekly, some weeks multiple times, for almost 6 years...there is a reason!  This place ruined all other Mexican food for me because now I compare everything to Cafe Zamora.  The carnitas is fabulous, the green chili is excellent, and if you really want a spicy treat get the Shrimp ala diablo!

You know, we have lived across from this place for almost 4 years and REALLY want to love it...however...everytime it is a let down!  Cute place, good service, but have yet to have a really good meal.  Usually pretty bland, nothing stands out, and in my opinion overpriced and really not worth it...sorry!

First visit as recent transplants to Verrado, very nice interior, friendly staff, food was good, the patrons at the bar were also very friendly!  Very comfortable establishment overall, prices are reasonable, looking forward to cooler weather to enjoy the patio.

This has become by far out favorite eatery in or near Verrado and honestly if we did not live here we would  one just for the pizza!  Their other offerings are really good as well, service is always spot on, and the atmosphere is comfortable and friendly.

I could not be more frustrated with Healthnet if I was trying to plead my case to a Chimpanzee!  We picked Healthnet as our Healthcare.gov "Gold" plan, have been paying premiums since January, have had our coverage cancelled now twice for billing issues, really difficult with claims, and several other billing related problems.  Please keep in mind we have paid all of our premiums and still have had all of these billing issues.  The latest...keep in mind it is August 11th...we received a notice today that our coverage was terminated July 1st...they have the money, we have no coverage...almost 6 weeks later to get any kind of indication of this matter, no e mail, no calls!  Although they are Johnny on the Spot with e mailing the bills and taking the money from my account via ACH...STILL...even after it says on their website I have been terminated!  Just ridiculous!

We have purchased one vehicle from Carmax and are currently considering another, there is a reason Carmax is the #1 auto retail in the nation!  Absolutely no hassle, easy process, great selection...they, unlike many other dealers, make it easy to want to do business with them.  Yes, their prices are sometimes a bit higher but to me it is worth it to not have the combative experience you get from most dealers.

Actual Japanese sushi chefs!  Very friendly staff, nice location, we just did the sushi bar on this visit and were not disappointed!  Reasonable pricing, seemingly endless happy hour, and the sushi was really good!

The last time we were at a PF Chang's we were not impressed so we have not been to one in a few years.  Having recently moved to the West Valley we were looking for some Asian food one evening and ended up at this location.  Very nice entry, good lighting inside, seemingly clean, prefer the bar area to the dining room personally.  The servers were really good, reasonable prices, and SURPRISE, the food was really good!  Have been back again for a second visit and just as good as the first, will continue....keep it up PF Chang's.

Amazingly good!  Don't discount it as I did based upon the name and location, this place is really excellent!  The Pho is fantastic and the spring rolls are really superb!

If you are near the Woodlea / Melrose area in Phoenix and are hungry...go here!  Great friendly service, great food, reasonable prices!  The coconut soup is fabulous, all of the curry dishes are fantastic, and the Thai E San sausage (listed with the salads) is really, really good!

Per Wei is always hit or miss depending on location...This one is a miss and been so consistently for quite some time.  I try it again every now and them in hopes they have hit but no luck yet!

I inquired about a CPO Mini I had found on their website, they gave me a price, I countered a bit lower but fairly, I was told they could not possibly "go any lower because it is a CPO car", passed on that and did not hear anything further.  So I continue to follow the car on their website and surprise, a week later, it is now almost $600 less than what I offered, no follow up call, no follow up e-mail!  Moral of the story...should have let me know, would have kept another $600 in the deal, made a sale, and perhaps had a happy customer.

Nice place, very friendly, good service, decent cuts, nice hair product selection.  The MVP treatment is nice, cut, was, scalp and shoulder massage, hot towel, dry and style, reasonable prices.  Have been 3 or 4 times now.

Unfortunately the reviews here were spot on!  We were shopping nearby last night, figured have never been so we would try it....HUGH MISTAKE!  It was packed with a 20 min wait so figured maybe it is good...wrong!  The food is really terrible, stingy with the chips and salsa, lackluster service and attention to detail, dirty, and not a good value.

Sushi in the West Valley continues to impress!  This place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon, small but nice place, we sat at the sushi bar, again, manned by a couple of Japanese sushi chefs!  We tried a few rolls and they were all very good, good service, and reasonable pricing, will be back!

If no stars could be given I would!  Should have been very easy but they literally seemed like they did not want to sell me a car!  Have good credit, nice trade, and still they were genuinely disinterested, rude sale associate, very disorganized sales floor, actually argued with me about the car I wanted!  Overall very short, very poor experience.

We have not been here for a few years and the last time it was quite good...things have definitely changed!  Overall the dining room was dirty, way too bright, just too many senior citizens (sorry)!  Then came the food...small portions, very salty, very prepackaged feeling, not good!  The server was overbearing and the overall value was poor.

I will preface this review with...this is not the AMC Esplande or the I-Pix Scottsdale!  Dirty, crowded, lots of senior citizens, no automated ticketing so you can purchase online but still have to wait in the huge line!  Popcorn was cold and obviously not fresh, other concessions seemed alright.  Bathrooms were FILTHY!  The IMAX sound and picture was good, the IMAX glasses were poorly cleaned, the screen is on the small side for IMAX.

Seemingly decent looking place,  we wanted to try given it's proximity to our home....will not return!  Sub par food, mediocre service, not a great value for the buck, and possible the worst restroom on 7th Ave, disgusting!

So as new Verrado residents we obviously want to support the local eateries, that said, I am not sure we will do dinner there again anytime soon.  The coffee bar is fine, good ice cream as well, lunch during our prior 2 visits was alright at best, but dinner last Saturday was just a letdown.  The menu I think is way too pretentious and poorly executed, seasoning was very bland on all three of our dishes, the server had no personality, and what is with the weird guitar guy with a synthesizer box???  I think perhaps time to get back to the basics and work towards doing those very well.  Anyway, very small portions and not much value with the pricing as it is.  On a positive note, nicely appointed interior and very clean.

Nice place, good service, great bang for the buck, and good food as well. Have been back several times for both lunch and dinner. Highly recommend.

I am sure others had their reasons for the scathing reviews but our experience was very, very good and certainly a much better experience than a recent visit to Conn's Home Plus.  I applied online for a LS credit account, had a approval instantly, went to the store on a Friday evening, very impressive facility, clean, nice displays!  We were pleasantly greeted, we were not hounded by any sales associates, when we needed assistance we received it gladly.  We picked out our items, the cashier was very, very nice and helpful, they arranged for our new furniture to deliver the next day, a Saturday, we received a confirmation phone call before we even left the store, the called to confirm in the morning, arrived on time.  The furniture was just as we expected.  We will shop again and would recommend.

I am pretty picky and I really like BBQ....that said I do not generally like standing in line to order but we pushed on!  The ribs were just OK, the moist brisket was outstanding, the green chili stew was also outstanding!  I tried my wife's pulled pork and it was again, just OK.  Very good service, place is clean, prices are very reasonable.  Oh...tried a few of the breakfast burritos the other morning to go...delicious!  Will be back.
