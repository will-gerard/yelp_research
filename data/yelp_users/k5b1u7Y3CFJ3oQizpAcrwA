Another new place discovered through my Sushi group.  As has been common, large groups with seperate checks tend to challenge them, but the food was propery delivered and very delious.  I enjoyed my standard Philly Roll as well as a Mark Roll and Mayflower Roll, all of which was very good.  I look forward to another opportunity to return and try other rolls on the menu.  Oh and you definetly have to try the MOJOS, very tastey desert.

This is my favorite Mediterranean resturant.  George and Liz run the family resturant with authentic family rescipes.  I have a couple of favorite dishes, Shawarma Chicken, Falafel (best ones in town) and Lemon Shrimp Pita  are my top 3 picks!

This restaurant has become a stable for my family as we visit several times a month.  We know many of the staff members and even worked really hard to get Creme Brulee back on the menu (sorta).  I'm a big fan of the Chicken Bryan and the Lental Soup.  And if you get the chance to have the Creme Brulee, it is the best I've ever had, I highly recommend it.

Went in for Lunch and was blown away at the speed I received my sushi, too bad I wasn't on a timetable because I would have been on time.  The food was good and there was a good size crowd for lunch.  Will return for another lunch run.

This is one of my favorite Sushi places, the only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars is just service.  The food is great, the chefs are fun, but the waiting staff is just off almost every time.  They disappear for long periods of time, they don't consider seating strategies when sitting people and when you are done, you often have to ask another waiter/waitress to let your waiter/waitress that you are ready for the bill.  Most nights you will be waiting for a seat, there is a long line before 5:30 waiting to get in when they open.  Enjoy the food, ignore the service.

Obviously from the name it is Italian food, but they do it rather quickly. Our visit was on a Friday for lunch and we took advantage of the lunch specials. I had the BBQ Style Chicken pizza and my wife had Mista Salad. As usual we ate family style and shared with our daughter who just loves to watch people moving throughout the restaurant.  The food was quick and the service was very pleasant. The salad was a full serving and sharing was not a problem. The black olives were a hit for Tara, my daughter and a great hit for my wife since she loves Balsamic Vinaigrette. The combination of greens, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and croutons makes for a refreshing salad.  The BBQ Style Chicken pizza is also big enough to share as well. Made with BBQ Sauce, Roasted Chicken, Roasted Red Onions, and Cilantro. This really hits the spot. I prefer a sweet tangy BBQ sauces over the spicy type and this one fits into my preference.  The bill came in under $20 and we kept it to an hour. We were very happy with our visit and plan to return again soon.

We've become a stable at this restaurant so much we know the family that owns it.  The happy hour is a great deal for getting some of the common rolls and the Climax roll is one of the best if flavors I've seen.  I like trying new sushi places both in Phoenix and when I travel, but this is the resturant that I keep going back to each time.

Okay, sometimes, just sometimes, you have to go to a main stream restaurant and we both felt like seafood last night and didn't want to figure something else out with a cranky baby.  So Red Lobster came up.    We shared the Harberfest with a side of crab legs (man, we love shell fish) and ordered the baby chicken and fries.  The waiter was very good and kept up with us and the baby.  He made sure we had crackers and bisects before anything else.  The food overall was pretty good, the lobster tail was one of the biggest I've gotten at Red Lobster, but appeared to be a bit on the older side since it was tough and the flavor was off.  So needless to say, we left some of that on the plate.  The grilled shrimp, shrimp scampi and crab legs were all great.  As well as the Cesar salad and mashed potatoes.  The baby was quite happy on the starch diet, eating mostly bisects and french fries.  When you just don't want to think a lot about eating out and seafood is on your mind, Red Lobster is a pretty simple and mostly reliable selection.

Good pizza places that deliver are hard to come by, or maybe I've become a Pizza snob, I'll have to check my wallet for a membership card.  Well this was a recommendation from a friend and we were in the mood for pizza, so we ordered up a House Special.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes before we'd have it, pretty standard and generally this is an under-promise over deliver type thing.  This is where we started off on the wrong foot.  I called an hour later to get a status of the pizza, it was out for delivery.  An hour and 10 minutes after placing the order we had it in our hands.  And I have to say, even if they did deliver on time, I don't think I would be ordering from them anytime soon, it just wasn't all that great, everything was pretty bland.  Order here if you need a pizza and any pizza will do and you have the time to wait.

Okay, it was a close Sushi place and I was in the mood for Sushi. So what the heck, the reviews were so-so and I thought I would give it a try. I debated for way to long on weather to just order rolls or do the AYCE method. I decided that I could just eat a couple of rolls and be happy so I ordered a couple of everyday rolls. A California Hand-roll, Philadelphia Roll and a Tootsie Roll. The Tootsie Roll was far sweeter than any Tootsie Roll I've had in the past, in fact too sweet, I think it set the stage for the rest.   The California Hand-roll was pretty good, it's pretty basic and easy enough, and it really didn't disappoint. The Philadelphia Roll is one of my favorites in general and it was okay.   Service was pretty slow, but everyone was very friendly and you could tell the regulars as they interacted with the staff quite a bit and really enjoyed themselves. The fact that they have regulars and are quite friendly is a testament to them.   Personally, I didn't come out of there thinking, man I have to go back it was that good. I would go back if I was eating with someone that wanted to eat there, but it won't be a place that I will necessarily recommend.

A friend and I met up here the other day, the staff was very nice and professional, making sure our water glasses are full while not interfereing with our lunch.  The waiter was very helpful in making a selection which I settled on the Thai Pasta, I decided to go vegetarian on this meal and it was very good.  The sauce combined with the vegtables and noodles made an excellent combination and while I thought the portion was large, I ate it all!  I am thinking of a return trip to try other great dishes.

Ordered the lunch Barg, let me tell you, this should not be lunch, more like lunch and diner.  The portion was plenty big and could have been easily shared with another.  I was very happy with it.  The flavor and taste is what I expected from center cuts of filet Mignon, skewered, marinated and broiled.  I went with a group of 6 and we opted to get the Persian Room Appetizer, again, a mistake on my part, the appetizer was perfect for 6, not totally unnecessary with the portions that we had.  The service was as expected from an up-scale type restaurant and would be great for taking the high-end clients to for celebrating a big success.

Most definitely a whole in the wall place, the food is very good.  On a recent visit the waiter suggested the cabbage and corn enchilada. Since then I've ordered them, they are very tasty.  The cheese crisps are a good appetizer to get you started as well, great variety.

This is one of my local favorites for work lunch.  The noise level is pretty low so conversations are easy.  I really like the Jalepeno Cream soup and my new favorite is the fish tacos. I recommend both dishes if you are trying to figure out something.

It might just be that we didn't order the right stuff or that they have Americanized too much.  My short impression is that the food was bland and pretty dull.  My wife ordered the Tacitos and while these are usually bland by design, it's the dipping sauce that gives them life and the Avacado sauce was disappointing as an over whipped Avacado.  My daughter at the age of two is an incredible fan of Mexican Rice and Beans and she wouldn't touch them here, she only ate the chips and salsa, which admittingly and disappointingly was the high-life of the mean.  I had the most order Pollo Fundido, the chicken (while all white meat) was extremely bland, the only thing that saved this dish was the jalapeno cheese sauce on top.  It actually had life and would make a great Con Queso dip in it's own rights.  I would like to see the meat livened up with a little jalapeno and salsa.  Show me the food I would see when visiting friends having a Fiesta, I know it's there, let it out and show your full potential as a Mexican resturant.

So last night, I took the family including the god-daughter to Shane's for a little break and get some grub.  We've been there several times and for quick and cheap BBQ, it's rather good.  This is the first time I've written about my god-daughter, so a little background on her, she weighs maybe 120 soaking wet wearing cement shoes, but can put it away more than anyone I know.  So I get the pulled pork sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese, my wife gets a dirt pulled pork sandwich (Cole slaw on top) and my god-daughter gets the buffalo wings with french fries.  We had more than enough food.  My sandwich with the original BBQ was great and we like the Macaroni and Cheese there.  This was my wife's first try at a dirty sandwich and didn't notice much in taste, but did acknowledge that the sandwich was more crunch.  My god-daughter thought the buffalo wings were good with the BBQ that gave the little spice a nice tang flavor.  The side of fries was huge, could have easily feed quite a few people with them.  The portions overall are good in size and the service, for ordering at the counter and they bring it to you has always been pleasant, the staff seems to enjoy working there and we have some fun with them on our visits, enough that will keep bringing us back.

Shrimp fried rice and pad Thai were very good.  The place wasn't much to look at but most of the restaurants off the beaten path aren't, its the food that brings you in.  This place had the food and the staff was attentive.

This was my second visit, and to be honest, I'm not someone that eats Indian food very much, this time I went with a party of 8 many of them are from India.  This time around I opted for the SEEKH KABOB LAMB, which was mostly meat on a plate of onions and peppers.  I really wished that bread or Ngo would have come with it, but I resolved that pretty quick with another order.  My co-diners were very good, they helped explain other items on the menu to me and help me pick out future dishes.  Overall the food is very good and very ethnic.  The service struggled not only with our larger party but the lunch rush.  If you like Indian food or want to try it, I would suggest Andoori Times.

Some of my friends have been bragging about this place and I was really excited when my Sushi group decided to have a meet up there.  I was not disappointed!  I ordered the famous Creamy Baked Lobster Roll, Happy Hour Philly Roll and the Pure Crunch Roll.  All were very good and the service was superb, the manager noticed an item on the table wasn't right and took the initative to correct it without being asked to.  The food was out quickly and accurately, and the waitress was on top of everything, I never saw the bottom of my water glass.

We found this restaurant by watching DDD, and while it is a bit of a trip, we planned it one day to go for a mid-day lunch, best time with a 2 year old after her nap.  Well, not here it is not.  Found out that they often close mid-day to re-supply.  Wish I knew that before showing up with a hungry wife and daughter.  We waited around downtown for an hour with some cranky family, but once we got the food, it was well worth it.  We got the Italian Stallion Pizza, which was good, but if you don't really like lots of meat, I would stay away from it, it's quite loaded with meat, but still very tasty.  We also got a really good Pasta dish, nice combination of broccoli, chicken and penne with a light sauce.  The staff did as much as they could with the first rush (which we were part of) and often making sure my 2 year old got plenty of bread to keep her happy.  Since I have business meetings in downtown Glendale from time to time, I'm betting you will see me return, just well planned out on the timing next time.

Some friends that live close by suggested it.  I was very impressed, my friends are vegan, so finding a place that accomodates them can be challenging, but this place did it without pause, and the waitress understood me when I said I was pescatarian, she had great recommendations and the dish was the special Sea Bass.  Very good!  I really enjoyed the thin and low salt chips they provide as well.

This is one of our favorite places to go, mostly for the custard desert that they offer. The dishes are very inspirational, you can tell there is a chef that is creating the combination of ingredients that inspires one to go home and attempt to be creative/artistic. The Salmon is very good with a side of squash. This dish is repeated often and we are always tempted to try a new dish or a special. The service is very professional and on top of our needs.   Just be warned, you will think you are in Scottsdale with the trendy atmosphere and the high end dishes, the bill will remind you that you are not in Scottsdale though.

I like a company that lives up to it's motto.  Everything was fresh and even had dates of when it should be removed from the shelves.  And Easy, why yes Virgina, it was quite easy.  The aisles where laid out and organized, found what I wanted, the quick checkouts and the fresh foods.  I even loved the fact that they also catered to the single or couple demographic by offering portions at that level as well.

The lunch special are very well priced for what you get.  I had the Caprese sandwich with vegtable soup that was very tastey.  Service was spectacular.  The food was prepared with the passion you come to expect from a high end resturant.

This little restaurant offers gourmet pizzas, salads, pannis and wine in a casual atmosphere. As customary, my wife and daughter all ate family style and ordered the suggested Chicken, Pine Nuts, Tomato & Gorgonzola salad and Pepperoni pizza. Being from Illinois, I'm a huge fan of Monical's thin crust pizza (which my wife now loves) so all thin crust pizza's are held to this standard. The pizza was a good attempt but didn't not replace Monical's pizza as the best thin crust. It was thin (almost cracker grade) and good, but just missed the boat on best. On the salad side, I'm not much of a salad eater, but this one did have very good flavor and offered up a great variety for taste. My only real criticism is that the restaurant is trying too hard to be on the high end of the yuppie scale with high prices and just too much arrogance from the staff. They were different in the sense that I felt the "you are lucky to be served her", however, when we asked for suggestions, the manager jumped in and made some very good, en-lighted and friendly suggestions that saved the day.

This is a great Children's Museum, lots of interactive exhibits for the kids (and adults), the first time you go, you'll spend all day there, for us, we're usually in and out in about 4 hours, my daughter knows what she wants to do and we go right to it.  It's fun to pretend and this is the best place for it.

My too favorite rolls are the Lotus Roll, this is about presentation, there is something about a sushi roll that arrives at your table on fire!  My other favorite is the Poison Ivy, a little bit of a spicy kick, and flavorful!  I recommend this place as well as those two rolls.

I was really in the mood for breakfast and you can't go wrong with The Good Egg, they have a great offering for breakfast.  Even though there was a wait, I was able to get a counter seat quickly and Catrina was a great waitress to make the breakfast complete.  I had ala cart, pancakes, biscuit and gravy and bacon.  Everything was as order and tasted great!

We ordered the shrimp cocktail for an appitizer and presenation was very impressive and the cocktail sauce was actually on the spicy side just as we like it.  From there we ordered the Salmon and the Shrimp Scampi.  Let me tell you, this place is about the butter, it was all very good since they weren't skimping on the good stuff, but if you are adverse to butter, you may want to stear away.  Everything was very good, the Salmon was very good and will be repeated, the Scampi wasn't so great, but still a good dish.  The shrimp was all large and worth the price.  The desert menu was large and offered a large variety, we selected the lemon pie and wasn't disappointed.  The only negative that we could say is that the service struggled to keep up with the customers that were there, they did their best and it was just the timing of our visit.  We will be returning to try other dishes in the future.

This has become a favorite location of some of my co-workers that are on a special boot-camp diet because they can tailer to their needs.  After planning an extended lunch one day, we headed out to eat, and I don't think we planned enough time.  They were packed, wall to wall.  They were polite and worked quickly to get us a table and the service was really impressive.  To be honest, when I walked in the door, I thought I might be in Scottsdale, lots of people looking like they were trying to impress others, including some of the staff, but they lacked the attitude that often is associated with Scottsdale.  What was the most impressive was the service, that will rate them high in my book anytime, polite, quick, willing to work with us.  The food was fast and good, and extremely hot, temp wise.  They worked past my concerns of time and delivered an excellent meal in a rather challenging time for them.

I struggle with this place so much.  Several times I've stopped by for something to eat and they would be closed during advertised hours, staff meeting or something else going on.  Well I got in last night and had a cup of chili and a cookie for a snack on my way to an appointment.  The staff was incredible in a good way, very happy and professional.  I was impressed.  The food, not so much.  The cookie looked over cooked and was okay, the chocolate was pretty gooey, even though the cookie didn't see so fresh.  Typically chili is more expensive than soup, which was true here and I wasn't so impressed.  It was too hot so I burned the roof of my mouth and it seemed to lack flavor.  I'd go if a friend suggested it, but I wouldn't be the one making the suggestion.

I'm always on the lookout for a good Sushi place, this one opened up close to home and I wasn't sure what to think.  My wife and I went in for a lunch on a day we didn't have the 2 year old, and boy am I glad we didn't have her.  It's more traditional seating, open back booths, I think we would have trouble keeping the 2 year out of everyone else's space.  But the food was great, lunch was ideal, few customers, lower prices and we opted to try several new things.  I did the 3 Rolls Lunch Special which includes Miso Soup and salad, both of which were very good.  The list of selectable rolls was pretty short, but still good, I went with the traditional Spicy California, Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna, all of which were very good.  My wife selected a Mongolian Beef Lunch Special, which I honestly didn't like and would not order again, typical poor selection of beef that is used, but he spices didn't taste good to me at all, so we'll be on the look out for other Bento boxes to get the next time.  Service was good, the waiter warmed up to use as we asked questions and everything went over very well.

Met friends for lunch.  I'm from the Chicago area and they are fans of Chicago style hot dogs, so it was the ideal setting for us.  Now I've been rather hungry from a good wet Italian Beef and I wasn't disappointed at all.  Both of my friends also enjoyed it with one willing to drive the distance to return again.  One friend had the Italian Beef like me and the other had the Chicago style Polish Sausage.  We're good hardy eaters and we left satisfied with the portions.  The staff was fun to work with, even the cook coming up to the counter to talk to us before preparing our food.  The environment was Chicago themed, reminding me of the high-lights of home.  Will I return, sure will, especially when a craving for good wet Italian Beef returns, I will have to try something else on the menu sometime, but the IB is what they are famous for and I can see why.

I was in downtown Glendale the other day for business and we decided to walk over to Bitzee Mama's for a quick lunch.  Well, it was anything but quick.  They really weren't that busy, and we waited 10 minutes to be seated, then 15 minutes to put in our order.  Needless to say I was rushed at the end to eat and return to my meeting, gratefully the chairman was with me for lunch.  The menu offers a nice Mexican and American dishes, but I would suggest the Mexican side, come on, that is obviously their thing, specials of Tamales and such, you can go to McDonald's and get a hamburger (without the wait of course).  I ordered the Burrito Enchilada style, which was good and authentic.  Once the food arrived, it was hot and had the typical Sonoran taste that you get in Phoenix.  The food was good and kept this review above 1 star which is where the service was putting it.  They really need to come up with a new culture of customer satisfaction and quick pace to keep their reviews from continuing to decline.

Okay, I didn't go for the music, I stopped by for lunch!  I was there for the food, and I was impressed.  The menu (while a little hard to read) offered a variety and everyone in the party was happy with the food.  The service was impressive, friendly, on top of the drinks and kept us posted on the status of our order.  I was boring with the Bacon Cheeseburger, which was great, but the Cobb Salad looked awesome, with or without the Tuna or Ahi.  The special sounded great (Crab Salad Sandwich) and lived up to the description according to one member of my party.  The place looked like a great venue for live music and just hanging out after work.  Well worth a check.

I came with a group of 28 people for a coworker. We were all worried that we wouldn't see our food for an hour, but they amazed us, our food was coming out quickly and it was very good. I ordered the Shrimp Fried Rice and it was one of the best that I have had and the shrimp were rather large. They have unseated our defacto Thai restaurant and will now become of our our regular spots.

My daughter is showing a lot of interest in theater and I'm on the search for a close children's theater to have the right introduction.  I can tell from the volenteers that they have passion for this little theater.  The kid actors were surprisingly very good for their age (much better than the school productions) and everyone was enjoying themselves.  I'm ready to sign my daughter up for the workshops.

When I first moved to Phoenix some 10 years ago, a neighbor introduced me to this place back when it was off of Cactus and I thought the appetizer sampler was great.  Not too long ago they moved to Union Hills and 59th, much closer to my current home and I was excited about a return trip.  I was rather disappointed, the food was rather bland and while the service attempted to stay top notice, they just seemed out of sync with us.  I don't think there will be a return trip in the future.

I dropped in on this place on my way to a comedy show, we were running a bit late, but man they were fast.  It was also the first time I've seen a restaurant use a tablet to take an order (saving time writing it down and entering it later).  I also noticed they had call buttons for the servers, what a proactive and forward thinking concept, and the place is pretty small and would fall into the hole-in-the-wall category.  The food was great, the service was fast and professional.  It's on my list to return and a good place to bring my vegetarian friends!

I was introduced to The Gladly by a Brunch Meet-up group and I was throughly impressed by how they handled the 40 people there for brunch.  There wasn't any problems that they didn't smile and take care of right away.  The spicy Bloody Mary is truely spicy and very good.  The atomosphere was very nice and the food was high end.  I will return.

I found this place thanks to Yelp and Opentable, the service was very good and the food was excellent.  I tried the Pesto Caprese sandwich using thier homemade bread, very very good adn finished my meal off with creme brulee, also very good.  The resturant had a nice ambiance that was a bit up scale.

This came as a recommendation from a friend, whose wife has contributed to the artwork at the center.  I was very impressed, it was small but they packed in the hands on activity.  My daughter wasn't able to do everything in our visit and I'm sure we will be back soon to do more activites.  She had a good time and it was a bit of a trip for us from Peoria, we did have fun and have referred a few friends to the center already.

I had an errand to do close by and only 30 minutes to grab something to eat, thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem.  When I walked in, I was greeted by the staff and when they learned that it was my first visit, they told me all about how it works, gave me samples of each of the meats.  I was excited about the shrimp tacos they offer on Friday (so I will be heading back on Friday to try them).  I did the burrito platter and it was excellent.  I really liked the fresh and authentic guacamoleo.

Service was a little slow but I'm going to chalk that up to culteral differences since I was having a power lunch and my server was trying to keep it casual.  We tried three rolls, Philly, Spicy Tuna, and THE roll (in house specialty).  They were all thick rolls, almost to the point of being too thick, but very very good.  The Miso soup and salad were great starters as we waited for our rolls to be prepared.  Both my friend and I will be returning to enjoy this resturant again as well as my other friends!

The Potato Tacos and Quesadilla were great.  Definitely will be going back to explore more items on the menu.  The staff was very nice and helpful to work with.
