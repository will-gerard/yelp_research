I've had a great experience everytime I've gone here. I just got done reading some bad reviews for this place and want to say that people should get over themselves. I have had food most of the time I have gone and out of about 8 things I have ordered 6 of them were great and two of them were ok or not good.  so.. I think that is a pretty good average for a theatre.  It's nice to have the option of dining and I don't expect the service to be like that of a normal restaurant because i'm there for the movie.  duh so for the whole experience it's absolutely great.  try it everyone and get the burger or the vege plate, it's awesome.  you can't beat an entire burger meal for ten bucks and you can have a cocktail with it as well.  very cool and I'm glad your here, and....if you want the server to kiss your feet, go to a restaurant and pay a hundred bucks for dinner and you'll probably get that, but.. you won't get an awesome movie experience either.  wise up people and stop being so critical, you obviously have never worked in the service business before and if you have...shame on you.

They don't have ketchup, lol they just have watered down ketchup,  Litterally watered down and they charge you for it,,lol they call it there Pete's sauce and told me it's a "spicy ketchup". This place is a joke! Have the owners travelled outside of there bubble to see what's happening today in the real world of fast/casual food? A square fish patty on cheap bun, with cold piece of cheese, lol, and a charge for tartar sauce. Omg they need to stop! If you don't have any sense of quality or taste then go by all means, but you have been warned. Oh...and I wasn't expecting amazing but this place is silly and left me wondering how many people have "bought" the propaganda of Pete's sauce.
