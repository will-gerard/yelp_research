I have been calling local business that provide sewing and alteration services to compare prices. The lady who answered the phone was short and impatient. I asked if the establishment would be able to "sew two queen size flat sheets together and what the price for this is" and I received an astonishing reply of ... $75 Are you out of your mind? That price is more than buying a brand new duvet cover. I've received the service of sewing flat sheets together before and the average price for the service with button holes has been $25-$35 Please attempt to know your competition and be somewhat competitive.
