I found APSK Martial Arts Academy through a Groupon and when I looked at their website, I called to leave a message to ask a few questions. It was just after 7 in the morning but Master Shaw answered the call and made me feel secure about having my almost 4 year old - a little under the age limit - attend a week of Summer Camp. The camp is action packed! From 9 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon, the kids are doing! Movie theater and swimming on the first day, swimming and dance and martial arts on the second day, Zoo on third day, dance, swimming, martial arts on 4th day and Skateland on the last day! Master Shaw and his instructors are great people! Absolutely NOT daycare, as they advertise, it is a learning and growing experience for your kid! My son will absolutely be returning!!

Rio is adorable and provides a little oasis that feels as clean and professional as Suddenly Slimmer but like it is your own private spa! Dannielli is, of course, the amazing! And I would gladly prepare 3 weeks in advance to have her expert waxing skills but I have had others and I have not left unhappy. It started as a neighborhood choice, many years ago, to go to Suddenly Slimmer but the kindness and skill of Dannielli has held me and Rio is definitely a piece of her! I wouldn't recommend any other place and I now live in East Mesa but will gladly fork over the gas moneyand travel time  to know I am going to be happy with the experience!

This is the second time I have entered Mother Nature's Farm. Last year, took my 3 year old and 8 month old girls, this year we are all a year older. To start, my girls have no interest at 18 months in bouncy houses, stickers, hay bale mazes, or hay rides. We were there to accommodate the big brother. Despite that, the entry fee is $10 (YES! TEN DOLLARS) per kid over 1. Really??? So, the fact that we had a deal with a friend who had a field trip rate of $5 per kid and $3 for parents is the ONLY reason we continued in. Went to check out the animals where some of my friends were which was convenient because it was right next to the porta johns and unfortunately, nature was calling me to use one. Oh. My. God. DISGUSTING. I have never seen anything more revolting than what was inside there. The sign on the door that showed the inspection showed that no one had been there since 10/8. Today is the 11th. Unexceptable. So, the good part is, my son got his hayride (the girls cried the whole time and I struggled to hold them as we sat), he had fun with friends in the bouncy house, stuck some stickers on a tiny pumpkin, and zipped through the hay maze a few times. So, for him, $5 well spent. I think $10 would have been pretty steep.  So, if you're going to the pumpkin patch, stop somewhere close and pee before you get there, make sure you are there with a field trip, and leave your kids under 3 with someone else. They will get nothing out of it except a walk through grass (or a stroller ride in our case). This will be our last visit.

If you have a Groupon, get your money back because if you actually see her show up, she won't use enough product on your hair (as referenced by another reviewer). This is the second appointment I have made to fulfill this voucher. The first one was cancelled by Sam via text when she ran out of product. The second one took some maneuvering as I, like many other mothers I am sure, needed to block out a time when I would have someone watching them. I picked a week when my husband was off work for a tournament he was playing in. He left a game early today so that I could make my appointment. I was soooo excited to get some time out of the house and get my hair done. But, there I sat in my car, parked in front of Artistry Salon, waiting... The door was locked and I received no response to my text, nor to my voicemails. My first appointment was in June. Today is October 30. There will be no more chances. I have received my refund from Groupon. Sam, at Artistry Salon doesn't possess the follow through to handle a marketing tool like Groupon. I wish I would have read the other reviews before I made the 32 mile drive out there. If I had hired a baby sitter, my rant would be MUCH more colorful but to simplify, STAY AWAY!!
