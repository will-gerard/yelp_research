Lux is a weekend staple-- Saturday without Lux would be akin to missing a critical appendage.  Well maybe not, but pretty damn close.   As others have said the coffee is fantastic, actually the best I've ever had.  The espresso is always perfect.  I have a weakness for their iced mochas-- really the only iced mochas I've ever liked. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too anything... just pure awesomeness.  And their whipped cream?  It took me about a year of visiting Lux to discover this sweet surprise, but it is so good.  Still not sure what the special twist is, but it is goooooood.   And their baked goods are better than any I've had at a coffee shop.  Most are made on-site in an adorable little kitchen in the hallway.  My love of baking tempts me to slip in, tie on an apron, and start baking- but I've held myself back from offering unsolicited help.  At least thus far.     The staff is always friendly and always remembers your name (or at least makes a concerted effort to do so). It's generally crowded-- which makes sense, being as it is, in my humble opinion, the best coffee shop in Phoenix... maybe Arizona... maybe the US. Somehow the crowds and loud music never bother me-- and I can always find a seat.   Lux is one of those places that seems like it would be too hip for my taste-- everything about the decor, ambiance, and clientele suggests this, but for some reason, it still feels comfortable and friendly.  Maybe it's the warm embrace of out-of-this-world espresso and brioche.... whatever it is, it's a fantastically addicting way to start my weekend.

I keep meaning to review this place.  Every time I go, as I'm sitting, devouring what I have proclaimed "might be my favorite pizza, ever.", I commit to reviewing Cibo, but somehow, in my post-pizza bliss, I forget.  Not this time!  Time to give credit where credit is due.  Cibo is 100% adorable... the repurposed old house, the charming patio, the live music in the evenings.... just adorable.  It's small(ish) but I think that's part of it's charm.  Somehow we've been lucky and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated, even on Friday and Saturday evenings.  (By the way... this is one of the main reasons I prefer Cibo over the highly-touted Pizzaria Bianco).    Antipasti-- I've had both the pear salad and the caprese salad and both are delicious.  Of the two, the pear salad is my favorite-- the honey adds an interesting element that compliments the rest of the salad nicely.    Pizza- La Noce is what I'm referring to as "might be my favorite pizza, ever.".  I love the flavor of the arugula, ricotta, and walnuts-- and the red sauce is perfect.-- an interesting blend of flavors that just works I've also tried the Pomodoro Fresco-- also delicious, but La Noce is still my favorite.  Others I've eaten with have ordered other pizzas as well and all have proclaimed them fabulous. The crust is perfectly done, thin without being soggy.    Service- The service is reliably good-- not amazing or remarkable, but good.  No issues here.    So if you like awesome pizza in an adorable atmosphere and you don't want to wait ages, this is your place.  Just do it-- you won't be sorry!

I visited Chelsea's Kitchen for brunch with a large group and have to agree with most other reviews-- this place is fantastic.  Nearly everything on the menu looked scrumptious and as a vegetarian I found that there were sufficient choices for the veggie inclined.   I toyed with the ideas of a spinach omelette with gruyere cheese and a veggie burger, but ultimately decided on Chelsea's Hotcakes.  I was absolutely delighted-- these are not your standard run-of-the-mill heavy, doughy, bland pancakes, people... these are special!  They're light and fluffy and infused with an orange essence.  Tiny bites of heaven.  Truly! They were served with a side of fruit seasoned with mint leaves.  I loved the refreshing mint-- although the fruit itself could have been slightly fresher-- the grapes had probably seen better days about a week ago!    The decor was tasteful and relaxed and the service was fantastic.  Our server was attentive and patient with such a large group, which isn't always the case. Although I didn't partake in any of their brunch cocktails, others I was with enjoyed the pomegranate margarita and white wine sangria immensely... perhaps a bit too much in fact!    As a nice touch, as you leave, instead of the same old overdone mint, we were offered a delicious chocolate chip cookie topped with sea salt.  The perfect salty-sweet combination.  Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm looking forward to going back and sampling more of their tempting menu selections.

Maybe this review should actually be 5 stars... I can't really think of a reason Switch *doesn't* earn 5 stars, but in this age of grade inflation, I must be judicious with my stars.  So yes, 4 stars, but if I could give half stars (and, why, Yelp, can I not?!), I would give this place 4.5 stars.    I've been here a handful of times and just LOVE it!  The ambiance and decor is cool and modern, with a staff and clientele that are more down-to-earth than the hip decor would suggest.  I love the variety of seating options, from a great patio, to a long shared table, to a bar, to laid back armchair seating configurations, to hightop tables, to typical half bench, half chair tables.  There's a seating situation to suit everyone here.  But that's not why we go to restaurants, is it?!  The food.  So good. So so good.  Admittedly I've only tried two entrees-- the triple grilled cheese and the mozzarella caprese sandwich, but that's because they're both so awesome that I find it hard to branch out.  They have a tempting veggie burger that I keep vowing to try... maybe next time!  This place has great selections for herbivores and omnivores alike-- my meat-eating dining companions have enjoyed burgers and sandwiches that they continually bestow with high praise. With sandwiches and burgers, you get your choice of sides-- all of which are delicious, but the mac n' cheese is out of this world.  Creamy and delicious and addicting.  And served with a sandwich, you'll certainly have plenty leftovers for lunch the next day- and who doesn't love that?  As an appetizer, I almost always start with the hummus which is delicious!!  Just perfect-- great texture, great seasoning, not too much or too little of anything.  The portion is large and it's served with plenty of warm pita bread, so order this one to share between two or more people.  It' s served with some pickled red peppers and artichokes that I don't care for, but I just push those to the side and dive in.   And the drinks-- so so delicious!  And their happy hour is fantastic- two for one.  Plus they have a great all-day drink special each day of the week.  They serve the unique 'drunken italian soda', a potent and sweet concoction that doesn't disappoint.  Last night I had the red sangria and it was also fabulous!  The sunrise margaritas are also fantastic.  Basically the cocktails are unique, flavorful, potent, and reasonably priced-- who could ask for anything more?  The service is generally pretty good-- a solid 3-4 stars. Never stellar, never horrible.  Just decent.  This is probably where they lose the half star-- but not because it's bad, just because it isn't as awesome as the food, cocktails, or ambiance.   So it's settled... in my book, this place is a 4.5 and I'll be back again and again and again.

Ah, there's nothing worse than crushing disappointment on a Sunday morning.  Well, maybe I'm being a wee bit melodramatic, but when I'm famished I tend to get cranky.  Joe's Diner is a hop skip and a jump away from our house and I've been driving past it for months thinking "hmm... wonder if that place is any good" .  So this morning, in what I thought at the time to be a flash of brilliance, I looked up Joe's Diner on Yelp (which very rarely leads me astray) and to my delight this neighborhood establishment had a 4 star average.  Not too shabby, and certainly worth a shot, right?! WRONG.  We walked in and it was busy (expected on a Sunday morning) and we were quoted a 10-15 minute wait. Fair enough.  But it was absolutely swelteringly hot and humid inside (swamp cooler maybe?!) and smelled funny (raw eggs left out?).  Still, we waited-- there had to be a good reason this place got 4 stars.  As promised, in about 12 minutes, the hostess lead us to the back seating area, but not to a table, and then just left us there standing, bewildered.  A few minutes later, another employee saw us there looking lost and hastily wiped off a nearby table and told us we could sit down.  Once seated, we were surrounded by tables of screaming children (not the establishment's fault by any means, but definitely did not improve our experience).  As we sat for 15 minutes, without so much as a glance from any of the servers, we soaked in the sweaty, stinky, dirty (did I mention the floors were filthy?), loud atmosphere.  It appeared there was no hope of acknowledgement by a server, much less a glass of water or a desperately needed cup of coffee, so we threw in the towel.  We stood up and walked out, defeated, hungry, non-caffinated, sweaty and disappointed, again without so much as a glance from any of the staff.    I want to believe that this was just an unusually bad day, maybe because it was a busy Sunday, maybe because the stars weren't aligned, who knows... and that Joe's Diner really does deserve it's 4 stars.  I'd love to have a decent (if not awesome) locally owned breakfast establishment nearby, but I don't know if Joe's is that place.  Will we be back to give it another go?  Maybe, only if we're feeling optimistic,  patient, cool, and pre-cafinated.
