Im obsessed with finding a great deal and I am a label whore... haha  but really, its one of my favorite place to get coffee, and other nicknacks at a great price! yeah, so you may have to dig to find what you are looking for but in my eyes shopping it self is an adventure- so enjoy the treasure hunt!

So I went into Waffle House to get my sweet tea fix- since I live in Arizona good sweet tea like thy make in the south is hard to come by... If you are looking for genuine southern nitty gritty greasy good ol' fashion food-search no longer! Sure the place inside my smell and May not look the cleanest but hey then again all the BEST PLACES have something wrong with them haha  The PRICE IS JUST RIGHT!  The service is without a doubt southern hospitality!  Vicky Woods was so kind enough to give me a FREE WAFFLE coupon for ONE FREE WAFFLE next time comes back

By far one of my new favorite places in the valley ! It Is what I wish ever public park looked like throughout the united states. Summer nights on Sunday are a picture perfect postcard of America -fireflies in June, families dancing and singing along with the live band.. This place is kids dream true a rail road train that goes around the park only  $2 (:

Being my first time using Ultra Klean Dry Cleaning the owner hooked me up with a 15% off (:   I very much enjoy the fast service- I brought in a little black dress here that reaked of cigarette smoke after letting a friend barrow .. after picking it up the NEXT DAY IT SMELLED CLEAN AND LOOKED LIKE NEW! I would recomend it to anyone (:

Its a 24hour joint it does the job it feeds your tummy -Meh. I've experienced much better food. The place is run down it def. needs a make over. The tacos are my favorite there I give them a 4/5. other than the fish tacos i feel as though the food is bland and the salsa is waterie just a pathetic excuse for Mexican food... sad day for Mexican food in Arizona!

If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all.. I kid you not, I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50) have I mentioned the minnie arcade? Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...

Happy Hour is ALWAYS fun at Rula Bula its one of my favorite places to go on mill its not filled with college Students but more of a mixture of post grad and established adults.  -The cider on tap is a must if you prefer a light beer  -When they have live music at night the vibe is beyond perfect

AS A SELLER: Its a great place to take the crap you no longer want and know that it will "change the world" but really the place is legit helps local schools, and saves the planet one item at a time. But be aware they are picky on the clothing they want like new trendy items and  funky vintage.   AS A BUYER: If you don't want to spend a shit ton or wear what everyone at the mall is wearing but still be Hip Buffalo is where its at! If you are lucky, some of the items still have tags on them!! Not everything is golden ( so shit is like ew. wtf) but most things are not that bad... You just need to hunt for the gold.

The staff was great though very friendly!

- generic main dishes  -dry rice white and brown -great service , very friendly -small portions when it comes to food fun fact- the kung pow shrimp is breaded so if  you think you are trying to be healthy ordering the shrimp think again at P.F. Changs

TOP restaurant I have ever been to in Arizona or even on the west coast.. Once you start walking into the pub you feel like you have suddenly traveled over the pond and back to America's roots BRITISH FOOD! I have always heard horrible  things about how British food consisted of mainly fish and chips and other bland entree's - to my pleasant surprise  the Food was Delicious! - huge beers  -Pasty for all food types  - the service is outstanding  Give yourself the gift of time travel and head on over  to Cornish Pasty Company  where you can leave the southwest once you step in the dark hall of the restaurant EXPERIENCE LIFE ABROAD!

if you want a a perfect gem that has all walks of life coming together around a local dive bar that is funky fresh MONKEY PANTS is the place for you!  Wednesdays never fails hilarious karaoke is always a riot, the drink specails are great too!  during day light hours it looks like nothing special but stop by the place around 10:45pm and its a a local spot filled with hipsters and tons of other people just down for a good time.  from 21- 65 perfect for all ages to just enjoy life and have a good laugh around at the live entertainment, hope to see you on wednesday night!

It's the perfect happy medium for a Saturday night out in the town and still keeping your dignity.. I had a blast no one was acting a fool besides the fashion victims that forgot we were in old town and not in Vegas .. The food was reasonable, filling, and delish.  The salad I had with my turkey burger was out of this world /Service was top notch.

Its an adorable little local place very intimate seating, the place is called TASTY THAI because that is exactly what it is, best food and prices I have had in awhile.   no happy hour because no booze, but one does not need booze with every meal especially when the food is this good!   this is more of an adult setting don't bring children its small and cute!

This place was absolutely amazing. I was there alone on a sunday afternoon and I was treated like royalty. I orderd the Green Chile pulled pork sandwich and it was the best sandwich I have ever had.  -The egg bun was the best part.  My server Lexi was knowledgeable and fun, she even reccomended a great cocktail that was thouroughly enjoyed.

If you want celebrity STAR treatment, and want to feel like you are getting a private session for a steal ... you may have to share with a few other people but you def. feel like its one on one -THE INSTRUCTOR IS HELPING AND GUIDING EVERY STEP OF THE CLASS! ( you can feel the PLASTES in action)  I love the fact that you can just drop in any day or time on a class and play a flat fee esp since I live such a busy on the go life.  I woke up sore this moring but I know the hard work will pay off, its my new favorite place to go on saturday morings before brunch!  This place is a hidden gem (:

At my second Yelp event ever, I took full advantage of networking with fellow yelpers at the Q&A session (in person meeting) which left a lasting impression. Meeting likeminded individuals seeking world class service anywhere and everywhere leaves one wondering while holding Businesses and Products accountable to excellent service at all times. I am extra precise on whom and where I'd like to spend my time and money particularly in today's economy when times are tough.   Yelp at Aveda was nothing less than a successful event starting off with Lindsay; she was a great host!   While mingling with fellow yelpers, we were treated to h'orderves  and champagne - talk about a fountain of knowledge! This was an elite event (I yet have been able to earn the honor), but I am working diligently to do so! So watch out - I am determined to join your inner circle of trust (hopefully it's as good as the circle of trust in Meet The Parents). But back to Aveda - the building itself has character its down town Mill Ave; historical in nature,  and once you walk in, it's like a breath of fresh air -trendy, hipster meets oasis loft ready to pamper your every whim! Services were marvelous and the goodie bags on the way out were just icing on the cake. I have posted pictures of what the gift bags included! Yes, be very jealous!

Free brownie with check-in & purchase of anything! ( the brownie was rich with peanut butter  and tons of chocolate, you won't regret each bite!   Happy hour is from 3-8pm daily!   You can rent the pig for your private events on Mondays!  $5.00 grill cheeses: fig,prosciutto & goat cheese (mouth watering)   American Swiss & cream cheese ( I didn't try it)   Smoked ham & American chess ( sounded great but didn't have room)   Pepperoni capicola, Italian cheese cherry peppers & siracha!
