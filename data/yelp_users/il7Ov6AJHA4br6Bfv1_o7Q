Bagels are good. Waited about 5 minutes before they started my cappuccino. 10 minutes after that when it was still an empty cup I told them nevermind and left. This location seems to do an ok job with 3 or fewer people in line. The one at Desert Ridge does better with rushes .

The Italian Stallion might be the best pizza I've eaten. The bruchette is delicious. The chocolate canoli is almost worth dying for.

Great New Mexican food. The house made chips are worth the visit. The chile con queso tastes just like my mom's. Unfortunately everything we got with the exception of the beans and rice was too spicy for my lovely lady.  A margarita would have been great but they don't serve alcohol.

Generally pretty acceptable. Really bad experience this time. At least the toppings were cold so I didn't burn my fingers putting them on the pizza.

Love the crap out of Noodle and Rice.  Best Thai around.  I have gotten several people as hooked on it as I am. Thai hot Panang noodles FTW.

I would post a picture but the food didn't last long enough. Customer service was great, as was the food. The owner is friendly and knowledgeable and his passion for meat really shows. While it's different in style from what i normally think of in barbeque, it was delicious and we will definitely come back often.
