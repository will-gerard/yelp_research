i usually eat here after i hit the gym, cause after a hard workout you want something light and healthy. The servers are always nice and attentive. Been here a few times and i havent had a bad experience yet. always ALWAYS have the humus!

What I like most about this place is the girls here speak English and they're so friendly! They run a clean and efficient business and I'm definitely coming back. i had the french done on my toes and i was pleasantly surprised that it didnt chip until the THIRD week. SOoOOooO worth my money!

The BBQ sauce is very good. That's about it. The pork was a bit dry and for the price, you'll think it should be better. I had the cookie as a dessert and it just taste like something out of a package.
