Exactly as expected. I had the country fried steak and I was full within ten bites. Must have been having one of those mornings.   Not really my thing, but a great experience and a really cool place. I will admit that I ate all the leftovers the same night, and it was still pretty damn good.  Guess Mama didn't make that much Chicken Fried Steak growing up.

What a fine establishment. Words can not seriously describe how special this place is to me. I always, always, always take a new date here. Hands down, The Rokerij, is in my opinion the only place that sets the mood, provides the food, and will make the ladies drool.   I can't afford to go there much, but it will forever be my favorite "first date" restaurant.

This place has saved me many times. I do work on technical equipment and sometimes the batteries I find are obsolete, rare, and damn near irreplaceable. These guys know their stuff and can make just about any battery pack.   Plus they offer open accounts which is huge for my company.   Thank you Batteries Plus....Job well done.

Only had the Chef Salad and while it lived up to the name in portion size, it was boring as all get out. I'm gonna have to try to their pizza on of these days. No lunch special besides the slice of cheese pizza, booooooo.   Really, nothing special. 12 bucks for a salad and an iced tea. Should have went to Picazzo's.

Anytime, anyone in town asks me where to go for the best burger my answer is always the same. Wineburger.   I think less is more in most cases, so I'm going to cut this review to the point.   Wineburger will forever be my favorite place for a burger. Please don't change.

Smooth experience, above par food selection, and fast. Not my first time here, and wont be the last.  After looking at the receipt I was slightly over charged from the special's menu, but not enough to say anything.   Salsa bar, hot chips, and fruit punch made up for it.  Thanks guys.

Tamales, tamales, tamales..  After reading reviews with lesser ratings I would have to imagine these must have come on a full moon. The gentlemen serving is incredibly nice, charmingly unique, and completely respectable.  The  tamale sampler was awesome, but more importantly the ceviche de camaron, Peruvian style, will be a dish not soon forgotten.  Can't believe I waited so long to try this diamond in the rough.

I'm a regular, I love it, and it loves me...  Can not go wrong with Santisi Brothers. It's usually packed, so get there early, and be sure to tip your waitresses!!

Value is the key word in this equation. If I spend 15 on a pizza, I want a decent pizza. This left the lady and I looking at each other wondering where the rest of it was. We ended up scavenging for salad stuff at home to ensure we were filled up.   The pizza was good, but not what I really was hoping to get. Sorry guys, but I'll be going back to Barro's for my pie...

Have to admit, if there's another shop in town that sells discs, I don't know about it. Honestly, even if there was I would still go to Spinner's. You know you're dealing with other people who play and understand the game.  The couple of times I've been there have been outrageously helpful and the guys there are true veterans of the sport. They've been helpful, respectful, and knowledgeable without being cocky or rude.   I drive from across town just to get here, and it's been worth my trip just about every time. Only once have I gone and the young man working the counter didn't know anything about the game or product. Otherwise, these guys are the best!

I'm apparently not as big into Greek as some of the others have posted, but I can honestly say anyone who's given this place less than three stars probably just expected too much. I had the best Greek salad that I've ever had, and I will agree with one review that it was definitely too light on the feta.   The service was great, food was excellent, and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side I felt as though it was a great value. Not one of the places I would take out-of-towners and rave about, but a great little spot to hit for lunch.

For the longest time I didn't care much for this place. Recently I got a new job in the area and I've found myself catching a lunch or two there. My perception was a little dreary, but after the few times going for lunch I'm in love. The bartenders are not only gorgeous, but the food is impeccable! Great burgers, wings, and probably so much more I haven't tried yet.   It looks like they have a professional chef whipping up all the goodies.   Awesome place, check it out..

I'm going to have to reconsider ordering pizza from anywhere else after eating here. I must have made it at the perfect time, because there was not another soul in the place besides the staff and the friend I brought with me.   We had the Italian Stallion and I've never eaten a more delicious, scrumcious(if this isn't a word, it should be), amazing pizza in my years on this earth.   If it wasn't so far from home I would probably eat there every day until I started growing pizza from my ears.  I don't know what else to say besides, GRAZIE!! (According to google, this is Italian for Thank You)

Gotta love this place. I discovered it about four weeks ago based on a recommendation from a co-worker. I was in the mood for a "good" deli, somewhere that treated the art of sandwich making seriously.   I found it.   Since my first visit, rest assured, I've eaten there about 18 times. Tried a few different things, but their calzones, pizza, sandwiches, pastries, pasta salads, and breads are all amazing.   Unfortunately, they could really use some help on the customer service side. They've had a sign on the door since my first visit looking for help, but as you can imagine, good help is hard to find. Plus, you can't just hire anyone that could possibly treat the food as well as they do. It's obviously more than business at Belfiore's, it's passion..

I can honestly say that I'm a fan of Dillon's. Yeah, it's no Memphis barbecue joint on Bealle street, but it's very homely and absolutely delicious.   I generally order the brisket, but the sandwiches, fish, and ribs are awesome and highly recommended. Stay away from the spinach enchiladas though. They really have no business doing Mexican food.  Sit at the bar, get a drink, and enjoy the company. Anyone I've ever met in there are always good people....

Best in class without a doubt. I've been coming to Frank's for 10+ years and thought I had written a review before, but apparently not.  Location leaves something to be desired, but who cares? I'm not trying to move in.   Perfect prices, perfect portions, and excellent crew.

Absolutely delicious and their lunch special was perfect for a man on the go. I went in, sat at the bar, and (I believe her name was Jenny) Jenny was an awesome server. She gave me my choice of any salad on the menu and a slice of heaven, I mean pizza. She even explained what it meant to be gluten free. Not that it matters to me personally, but it's intersting to know and helpful to many I'm sure.   Thanks guys for the great service, awesome salad(super bomb crutons that I've been dying for), and the little bit of heaven in a pepperoni covered slice of picazzo!!

Perfect price, perfect service, and you can bet I'll eat here again! Had the Gyro Burger because it was on special, but I could not have picked a better start to this place. Made me realize there's more to burgers than some of the other places in the area.   Fries were on point and everything on the menu seems amazing. I mean, mini corn dogs, really guys, thank you..Plus, any time you spend more than 10 minutes to decide what to drink, it's not really indecisiveness, it's exploration. I can almost guarantee that there's 30-40 that you've never even seen before.  It's no wonder it lead the charts while searching for a local burger joint...

Plain and simple:  FREE Tickets - Awesome Good Acts - Awesome Close parking - Awesome  Charging triple THE NORMAL rate for the drinks and making you buy 2 - Unacceptable.   For the amount I spent for our party of 4, I could have ordered 4 pizzas, bought 4 bottles of premium alcohol, and hired a midget to come to my house.  The joke is on you Stand Up Live...

What a great business model:   1. Hire young kids to work the counter who have no training in customer service.   2. Overcharge for sandwiches with absolutely no spoken or obvious options. (If they exist this is news to me.)   3. Offer delivery, but confine it to a 1/4 mile square area. (Basically the area of the shopping center they're located in.)  Yup, looks like this place will be another victim of a trend. I will usually visit a place multiple times if I'm told that it's something special even if the first experience is something less than ideal. This location has let me down so many times with poor customer service the likelihood of a return visit is completely null and void.   Hey Jimmy, you should try and rethink and regroup on this one buddy. Trends only last for a short while and fade away with phone books and record players. You may have your time, but it won't last with this formula.

I'm honestly not sure why I keep going back here, it's disappointing at best. I could go on and on with the many reasons, but I only gave this place two stars because I know it has potential. I'm just hoping that one day, one day, that I can order a poached egg and not have it delivered to the table under-cooked..Just once. If the name of your business has the word EGG in it, you should have the best egg cooks in town.   There's something about every business that's been in this suite; Good Egg / US Egg - Neither one could cook an egg to save their life.  Honestly, I don't think I'll ever be back..This was a last straw.

I rarely, if ever, write a review the first time we try a new place. Papa's was no exception, and twice now I've had some of the best pizza in the neighborhood.   We have family in from Illinois, they wanted pizza, so I thought I'd throw them for a loop and get the same Chicago style thin crust they get just blocks from their house.  It worked, they couldn't tell the difference and my order was delivered quickly, the pizza/wings were hot, and all is well. Think most people are quick to offer up their negativity, but are short with compliments. I've got nothing but good things to say about Papa's!!  Thank you!

I've been going to Miracle Mile since I was a kid and it's still as good as it gets!!  Just thinking about it, Post-Straw, is making my mouth water..  New location is certainly smaller than the other locations that were around the valley, but definitely cleaner and likely a much needed upgrade for all.   Thanks for hanging in there Miracle Mile!!
