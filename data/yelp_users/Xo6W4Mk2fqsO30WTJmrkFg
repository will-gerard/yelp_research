I love Dick's Hideaway!   The food is amazing!   It's cooked over an open pecan wood fire.  The smells are wonderful, the staff is kind and attentive ... it is the perfect neighborhood bar.   Everything that we ate was perfect ... chicken quesadilla, cheese steak sandwich ... the fries are great.

My son went and got us subs for dinner last night.   I had the JJBLT.   Not good.   The bacon had an odd taste, and, despite my request for "Crispy", it was soggy.   I ended up eating a lettuce, mayo and tomato sandwich.  Disappointing consumption of calories.

Shelly is the most amazing realtor in the valley.   She has assisted me in buying 3 houses over the past 6 years.   Shelly always has a finger on the pulse of the market and gives me great advise.   I also appreciate that she knows North Central Phoenix so well.   If it's a Ralph Haver home that you're looking for ... she knows where to look.   Her friendship and professional assistance have meant the world to me.    Shelly IS your realtor if you want a positive experience.
