I don't always go to JoAnn's fabrics but when I do it seems to always be the most wonderful visit. Today I was in need of a temporary BLACK backdrop cloth. I found the perfect material and LAURIE, the cutting clerk - not only cut my fabric to perfect size but she gave me a friendly and fun math lesson while I was there. Heavens knows I'm not the sharpest mathematician, but today I feel a little sharper thanks to Laurie and she did it ALL with a smile. Thanks Laurie. That's good service. I couldn't let your ABOVE AND BEYOND efforts go unnoticed. Guess who'll be going back to Jo-Ann's more often?

Dave came out, surveyed the work, set a date and time to come back and install the new window. On the set date of installation Dave came back out, he arrived on time and installed the glass QUICKLY. I think the whole process may have taken less time than it has taken me to type up this review and for that -- I am happy.

So there's a new DOLLAR TREE coming to the Cheddars Shopping Center on Chandler Blvd @ the 101. I noticed the sign and pulled into the parking lot last night, only to see the COMING SOON sign in the window. It was dinner time, and NYPD is located in the same shopping center, so we decide to order take-out. We visit the state of New York often, and love the pizza. With a few extra dollars in my hand, (since the dollar tree isn't open) - the hubby and I decide to dine at NYPD. The atmosphere was charming, warm and intimate, but my BIGGEST KUDOS would be the staff. There were only 6 people working that evening, (besides the cooks) and I promise you, we must have met everyone.   NEW CUSTOMERS MEAN ALOT! I really don't know how else to put it. We were greeted with a smile upon entering the door by SHELBY. She tells us how the joint operates, hands us a menu and ushers us to the bar, to sit  & read the menu. Once at the bar, reading the menu, we are approached by the General Manager, MIKE -- he just wanted to make sure we have been helped and are indeed ordering take out, because there was plenty of room available in dining. I stood and went to the register to order our pizza and ERIC, was all cued up with the darling'est smile and most awesome customer service regarding  NYPD's  home made pizza crust, their toppings, and his knowledge of NY's Time Square and good pizza, (he also mentioned having family on the East Coast). The bartender JEREMY came over while we were ordering and started talking about drinks. We followed him back to the bar and ended up sipping FOURSQUARE: Peach and Pumpkin Pie beer. The pepperoni, black olive, fresh garlic pizza was beautiful in delivery, and absolutely tasty to the pallet. It's the closet you're going to can get to pizza in Times Square from Chandler, AZ.   FRESH INGREDIENTS TASTE BETTER! NYPD is all about fresh ingredients. When customer service is as fresh as the food you're being served -- you've got a WIN-WIN SITUATION and a opportunity to make a great dining memory in the process. The hubby and I WON on all fronts. Thanks Dollar Tree -- for leading me to NYPD PIZZA! I will be back.

This was my first time visiting Floridino's, I was lured in by a courtesy direct mailing magazine. Coupons accompanied the advertisement, so what did I have to lose? The establishment was quaint and 3/4 FULL occupancy on a Tuesday at 12:30 in the afternoon. I was pleased to observe. We were seated & waited on by Cody. Bright eyes, big smile, extremely knowledgable, great at selling & encouraging and quick witted. I ordered a dozen pizza muffins: 6 pepperoni & 6 sausage -- they were OUT OF THIS WORLD with flavor. Perfect in ingredient proportion and Cody brought two dipping sauces that added to the experience: marinara & ranch. He was extremely attentive to our table & escalated our already tasteful dining experience THROUGH THE ROOF. My lunch date had a 7" pepperoni pizza - the crust & sauce is enough to write home to Momma about. I conclude: We dined sufficiently & that we will be back. PS... It was so good that we couldn't help but tip heavily & forewent using the coupon.

The service at this location ROCKS! From the front door straight thru the kitchen. The venue is cute and quaint and offers a trellis vine covered patio that was largely unused at the early hour that I visited, (11:30am), though I could see myself and a few friends chatting it up while sipping bar favorites and eating pizza muffins, SOON.. The server told me that the establishment has been there for 13-years (+/-), so I know it's not new, however it is greatly under used. Can you say "party of 10, 12, 13?" I can. Easily. So yes, I'm making plans for this place as I speak. The service is good, the food is good and they have ample room. It's a recipe for a good time waiting to happen!

I have ordered pizza from this establishment at least twice a month going back 6 months now. The pizza ingredients are always fresh and the presentation is always scrumptious. The customer service, when I call to place the order, is always taken with a smile and they've yet to get my order wrong, not to mention the delivery service is quick. They always beat their estimated delivery time by at least 10 mins. I love this place.

Just had Rosati's for lunch today. It was okay. Not as GREAT as it has been in the past. I picked it up at 20 mins (like they told me to when I ordered it), however, the cheese was already set. Once home, I began to chow down and noticed the pepperoni tastes  a little different. This is actually the 2nd time I've bought pizza and the meat tastes different. 2 weeks ago was the 1st time, so I don't know if they're switching up vendors, products or what? But when a recipe is perfect - you really shouldn't mess with it.  I'm sure this won't be the last time I order from Rosati's. Other than the fore mentioned statement their pizza sauce and thin crust is explosively good.

Joe's does not disappoint. GET THE BRISKET. These guys know what they are doing. Ask a Texan. That would be me and I highly recommend.

You've heard the expression, "I'd rather have teeth pulled?" - right? Well, guess what, it's certainly an attractive option if you're going to have it done at Dr. Hilarry Douglas' office.   You couldn't ask for a better DDS, or staff. From the moment you walk in the door and are greeted by Chris, to going back  beyond the service door and seeing Kali's smiling face greeting you from her desk, to sitting in the hygienic seat of Jackie, or reclining back with mouth wide-open, being worked on by Dr. Douglas --  it is a pleasant experience.

Believe it or not my family and I always enjoy our visits to Dr. Douglas' office. My teeth always look fantastic upon leaving - however on my last visit I received EXCEPTIONAL CARE from Kris, (the front desk clerk), Melissa Shipman, (the office manager) and Jackie Luce (the Hygienist). If I went into details of just HOW above and beyond in service they went for me on my last appointment it would take all day to write out -- so I won't. But I will say this, Dr. Douglas is working with an unbelievable team and I love them. I honestly feel like I owe them all dinner for making what could have been a 'crazy day' feel 'a-ok.'  Good service is not ever a given -- it matters not how much you pay and then there are those establishments that are so awesome that you almost feel like 'surely you haven't paid enough.' The latter is true of Dr. Douglas' staff. AWESOME FOLK.

I honestly thought my dark brown skin was not a candidate for hair laser removal until I met Jenn at Chandlers LASER FOR LESS office and she broke down the facts in layman terms. For the last few years I was suffering from "random chin hair plucking syndrome," and it was getting old. Jenn was knowledgable about the laser equipment and took the time to explain to me the melanin complexion/laser relationship and assured me I was not too dark for laser treatments. Jenn "baby stepped" me through the first two or so treatments, because I was full of inquiry. She answered my concerns politely, always with a smile and made me feel quite comfortable. I purchased a 5-treatment plan and have received 4 laser treatments so far -- and I must say, my chin looks like it did when I was baby. YESSS!!!! I am much happier and certainly less hairier having met Jenn and consuming the services provided at LASER FOR LESS. Thanks Jenn! You're professionalism and knowledge convey is tops! I couldn't have asked for a better first laser experience or technician.

It's was cold and quiet with the exception of a screaming baby. No warm feeling or door greeting for that matter. My 3-year old actually asked me if this was the doctors office. LOL! -- and she hates the doctors office. Very cold place - vibe wise. It's now 22-mins past my 10:30 am appointment - I've long filled out the intro paper work and am now sitting in the car in their pkg lot writing this review.  I sat alone in the wait room and no one ever said said Hello - not even when they silently handed me the paperwork. Lucky me, this place is literally within walking distance to our home and unfortunately my child care search continues. F.Y.I. It is imperative that I feel that you absolutely love your job and that YOUR ESTABLISHMENT is a great place to be in -- in order for me to feel OK with leaving my child in your care. This was not that place. I witnessed  2 employees get into a tiff behind the counter over 'who didn't do what at some other time." Really? The ONE STAR that I did render is because, honestly it's A GOOD THING  that I saw THIS type of staff service on Day 1 rather than....

Always a good sip & this mornings coffee run was FREE via a Good Samaritan (the 19-year old order taker who totally looked 14).  The window tender said she enjoyed our energy during the order process. Yeeee!!! I'm always amped UP when in their line for their awesome Dutch pressed bean. Mmm.

The pains at my jaw joint are nothing to laugh at however Dr. Farrell made me smile numerous times during my visit. He's got awesome chair-side manners. His subtle humor helps to subside any anxiety you may have arrived with. His staff is exceptionally professional and quite posh in their fashions. Yes! I noticed. I felt right at home. Their friendly attitudes were unmatched and greatly appreciated because I was in pain during my visit. Dr. Farrell has several options to help me out as TMJ/BRUXISM SURGERY is just out of the question for me - right now. My research for alternatives lead me here. I am certainly a more informed patient post my appointment. Thanks Dr. Farrell and AZ TMJ staff!

Customer service should extend from the headquarters, while in transit and directly to the customers door when you are a courier service. Today at 12:20pm (noon) I was on my way home in the Ocotillo area when I end up behind an ON TRAC van (with company log magnets on both doors). After following him about 1/2 mile up the road I put on my right blinker to turn, however the courier just yanked a right before me, with no blinker. The very first stop sign we approach, I have my left blinker on, however, the van driver in front of me, neither signaled to turn nor stopped, he just coasted straight through the stop sign turning left. After I'd come to a complete stop at the stop sign I turned left and proceeded down the curved road that I reside on. Once the courier driver sees my car in view approaching the back of his he hit his brakes and stopped in the middle of the street -- I came to a stop as well. He looked into his right arm rear view mirror and gave me the "annoyed face." My home was two houses up on the left, I just wanted to get home. I made eye-contact with him thru the mirror and he threw his hands up. I then made hand gestures to get permission to go around him. He shook his head yes and motioned me to go around him. I pressed my garage opener and pulled into my garage. Once in park, I went to check my mailbox to see if the rude driver was still in the street. He was. He got out of the van and started checking the tires -- all while in the middle of the street, no hazard lights -- then got back into van  and drove away.   I'm not sure what his problem was, but he did not drive like nor possess the mannerism of anyone I would like to have delivering parcels at my front door. He was way too paranoid to be available to provide good customer service or to be driving the company logo-plastered van through traffic. I would have been horrified if he were actually in route to my home today. That would have been weird.   I don't know who will be delivering my next parcel, but I know who it won't be.

It's never too late to deliver GOOD SERVICE. I ordered a piece of workout equipment a few days ago and today @ 10:12am -- it was delivered via an ON TRAC Courier. I was under the impression the parcel would be coming via FED EX, but somehow it was ON TRAC (and 2-6 days ahead of estimation).   If you read my review of 9-months ago, then you know I was in no way looking forward to using their services [ever] based on their "random transit behavior" in residential traffic (on my street). However, today was different.  I can't say enough about the kindness of the gentleman courier who delivered my parcel today. He rang the door bell and was exiting my lawn by the time I got to the door. As he entered his van, he looked back and noticed that I was a female, he then yelled from the cab,   "It's pretty heavy. Would you like me to take it inside for you?"  "Oh no!," I said, "Thanks anyway."  His response, "Well, I'm from the South, it's not a problem, I love to help."   SOUTHERN CHARM wins every time.   I 'skidaddled' (quickly tip toed across my lawn) over to the truck and said, "Me, too...". He said he was from Arkansas and continued to offer his services of carrying my  package inside. How kind of him. I looked at his van and said, "ON TRAC, huh? I can't wait to write a review on your safe delivery and awesome customer service."   #WORD kept. I love writing POSITIVE REVIEWS. Thank you On Trac for giving me the  opportunity to do so, on your behalf. :-)

I had never heard of Salad n Go but saw it on Gilbert Rd yesterday as I was leaving a film shoot. I approached the walk-up serving window and waited in line behind another young lady who appeared to be requesting additional salad dressing. She and I were the only two people in line - once the window server helped the young lady in front of me, she shut the walk up window in my face. I started a conversation with the lady leaving the window, I just wanted to know if the food was any good, (because the service was showing early signs of lack-luster). The young lady said this was her 'first time dining here,' that's when NATE walked up and said, "Are you considering eating here? Their salads are the best and I love them." Great!, I said. Nate then approached the window and started to facilitate dialogue about the establishment between me and the walk-up window worker. Basically, he was trying to get her to chime in and tell me how good their salads were -- but she was uninterested. Nate must be the best patron ever, because he then asked for the manager to come to the window, to confirm how fresh and organic their food is, but when the window clerk called him to the window, (keep in mind we can see him, as this is a small establishment, no bigger than a drive through sonic), he didn't budge. He looked towards the window and saw Nate and I standing there, and said, "For what?."   I then asked the window clerk for a menu, and she responded in the most dry tone, "We don't have one." Nate asked if the establishment was online and asked for the URL. The window clerk jotted it down on the back of receipt paper and handed it to him. Nate handed the SaladandGo.com url to me. I thanked him for his time and personal review of the establishment. He was merely a dining guest. He doesn't work there and if it weren't for him, they wouldn't have gotten the 1-star, I did render, (besides the fact that there wasn't a "NO-STAR" option.)   Will I patronize them in the future? Likely not, especially at the GILBERT Rd. LOCATION. However, Nate assured me, the service is much better at any of their other establishments & attempted to place the blame on the Gilbert Location being NEW. It's really too bad they didn't want to acknowledge me or serve me yesterday, because I was hungry as heck, and I really LOVE writing AWESOME REVIEWS about Great Food and Customer service.   Well I tried and THANKS NATE!!!

I'm a documentarian/camera woman and my shoulders have been rock hard for years now as a result of carrying the camera into action. At the first sign of stress my shoulders tighten up like THING (on Fantastic Four). Not a very feminine feeling or look, but I chalked it up to a small consequence for a great career. My mom bought me a Massage GROUPON for Mothers Day 2015, she felt like I could use it -- a few weeks ago I redeemed the voucher. I was assigned to a small framed (maybe 110 lbs) masseuse named Christina. For 60-minutes she leaned into me using her forearms, hands and body to manipulate my knotted up muscles. Afterwards she recommended we do a series of treatments to help dismantle the brick wall that has taken over my shoulders. Christina recommended I visit once a month for an hour massage and the price quoted for maintenance was significantly lower than the usual price for an hour massage -- signed up. Initially (and ever so briefly) I was thinking 'a years  commitment seemed a bit much for a little tension (brick wall),' but then I thought, 'What the heck! I'm worth it.'  I'll be having another appt. with Christina tomorrow and I couldn't be happier about it. Every time my shoulders get close to acting like they want to tighten up, I whisper, "Don't make me call Christina," and the tension subsides. STRUCTURA BODY THERAPIES in Chandler seems to be the real "muscle manipulation" deal and I'm loving the maintenance so far. Over the next 12-months I'll be sure to drop in and YELP updates. In fact, I'm looking forward to it. #ByeByeRockShoulders and no more feeling like Ms. THING.

It's always so very good - this time I brought my own bbq sauce condiments. If only RAISING CANE's offered bbq condiments -- I'd be in chicken tender heaven without my condiment stash. But until then... I love this place - the recipe for good food, CUSTOMER SERVICE and success can't be beat.

The WINGSTOCK 2015 event in Mesa was a festival for the TASTE BUDS. I had not ever heard of BLASTED BARLEY's -- however during the consumption of 3 of their DYNAMITE (sauce) wings, I became a fan. I can't speak on the goodness of their beer, because I didn't drink any at WINGSTOCK, but you better believe I will be accompanying my next order of DYNAMITE wings with a glass of their signature barley on tap. There's no impression like a 1st impression and this establishment out BLASTED many at the WINGSTOCK EVENT.

My first time eating here was maybe a month ago and I've visited 3 times since then. 3 times in a month! Not because I was too lazy to make dinner, but because the food is so darn good and the customer service is tastefully comparable. I don't remember who helped me at the ALMA SCHOOL Rd location the first time but the second time it was an awesome guy with a great smile named Chris. If I were any hungrier than I was he would have sold me the entire menu. I've never experienced such a friendly and hard pressed up-sell on a milkshake and Chris was correct, it was delicious! I inquired more of the youthful, friendly and outgoing employee (with braces) only  to find out that he is the manager. How befitting. I honestly had never heard of SmashBurger before stumbling upon it in the business shopping center. Now I can't miss it when I'm craving something tasty and substantial. They have an awesome selection of buns too: Egg, multi-grain, whole wheat, etc. And what can I say about those BUFFALO SMASH FRIES?  3 words: Watch-your-calories. The buffalo smash fries are delightful. They are almost shoe-string cut, so the calories seem so small.  The third time we visited this location was last night we were helped by Yasmin. I am all too thrilled to report that Yasmin was just as friendly as Chris. Good representation. Good staffing. Great food! They're literally SMASHING the competition.
