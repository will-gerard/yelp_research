Order accuracy!!! Hot fudge Sundaes are not made with mint chocolate chip ice cream, idiots. Third time that the drive through window has completely screwed up our order. Never again

Pulled in and pumped gas into the rental car. Owner John noticed a very low rear tire and alerted me. Patched the hole ln the problematic tire in a couple of minutes at a super reasonable price and sent me on my way. Gas prices a little more than the Circle K across the street, but solid neighborly service instead of corporatism. Recommend

First off, when I tell my friends that I'm going to the movies at the Harkins Christown, they look at me like I'm insane. NO, peeps, it is NOT old scary Christown theater that used to be on 19th Avenue. This new Harkins is located on the "back side" of the Mall close to the Wal-Mart. I found that some of my friends didn't even know this theater was here at all!  I go to this theater about once a month (matinee shows are very reasonably priced!) and the All Digital Projection and digital sound is awesome. The stadium style "rocker" seating is comfy (fold up armrests with cupholders is nice for movie date night) and the theaters are generally clean and trash-free. The audiences are the only reason that I deduct one star - theater management/security should do a better job in controlling some "hood-ish" behavior, and some showings have LOTS of immature teenage behaviors - to the point that it seems like half of Central High's sophmore class is sometimes in attendance (especially opening nights) - all of these "kids" were yelling "Stephanie, we're up HERE!!" at the top of their damn lungs about 10 minutes into the movie last time I was there for a Saturday matinee!   Back on topic, the snack bar is good for a movie theater, there's self-service ticketing kiosks, you can purchase tickets online, and the theater is thoughtfully disabled-accessible (thank you Harkins for that!) There's also assistive listening devices and closed captioning options available too. Plenty of parking too, and I've noticed a comforting level of police "presence" in the parking lot after late evening showings.

Commercial thieves. They stole $385 from my direct deposit with their shady "banking" practices. The customer service call center could not figure out what happened with my direct deposit, I verified the amount with the depositor as one dollar amount, but that amount is absolutely NOT the amount in the account. Branch said that if an error was indeed made by them, the overnight auditors would locate the error. AZ Federal refuses to resolve this with the depositor's bank. I am going to the Arizona Secretary of State's office in two day. Highly advise that you NEVER do business with this crappy credit union. I will post the names of the people involved in this later. SHADY!

pretentious staff and mediocrity. Coffee no better than Dutch Brothers and more expensive. A place to be seen in... for annoying self absorbed hipsters. At my age, I don't fit their douche demographic. Been here twice this week, but there's no sense of service with the staff.

Rented a subcompact car from this Enterprise location. Arrived at scheduled time and there were no sub-compact cars available, but they upgraded me from a Chevy Spark to a newish 5 door Toyota Yaris at no additional charge, which was great. No problems with the Yaris, returned it with slightly more gas than it had when I picked it up. The manager offered me a ride home so I didn't have to call a cab -- on a 115 degree day, I'd recommend this location and will use this branch again.

Saw "Lincoln" at a matinee showing for $5. There was 3 other people in the auditorium. Great movie, clean theater, fresh popcorn, nice theater people, and nearly a private showing. What's not to like?

Carne Asada Burrito is top-notch!! Their tacos are awesome too. It's basically a food truck with tables under an awning in the parking lot of Charlies Bar. Nice employees, good food, can get extremely busy so be prepared to wait at peak times. Highly recommend.

Shady, ghetto car rental firm. My recommendation - NEVER rent from this criminals. I rented a vehicle from these wankers via the ORBITZ website. Received a great quote on a mid-sized vehicle (a Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, or Dodge Dart according to the reservation) for $19.95/day with unlimited mileage, and an additional $6.95/day for comprehensive insurance coverage. Well, what a effing scam Payless was. The extremely rude and high-pressure young lady at the car rental desk (shared with Payless' parent company, Budget) named Kenyatta was a complete scam artist. My quoted price for insurance via Orbitz was NOT honored, although I had a PRINTED copy of the reservation from the Orbitz website in my hand. The car that Kenyatta offered me was not a mid-sized sedan, but a Ford Fiesta 5-door. Which would be a compact car according to Payless' own website. So, she was downgrading my vehicle a size class and wanted to charge me $9 more a day for comprehensive insurance, and was a complete biotch in the process. GHETTO, gurl!!   I went to Enterprise, showed them my reservation, informed them that Payless "didn't have a midsize sedan available", and that they were super-rude and extremely basic. The young gentlemen at the Enterprise rental counter AGREED that Payless was shady, honored my ORBITZ reservation (Enterprise is also a partner with Orbitz he told me), was extremely polite, and when I got to the vehicle pick-up line, I found that I was given an almost brand new Chevy Malibu sedan (a size LARGER than my reservation) at no additional charge. I even said to the lot attendant this is the wrong car, I should have a Cruze or a Focus -- she said no Sir, this is the right car for you - you received a free upgrade because of your inconvenience. Still in shock! Thank you Enterprise and Orbitz for having my back. Payless, you can SUCK IT! =P

The lunch menu pricing not comparable to quality of food. $16 for bland French Dip and $12 for a not fully cooked AB Angus burger. Four Peaks beers were $14 for two beers - thank goodness my lunch companion was drinking lemon water. $50 for lunch is steep, but it would have okay if the food and service was friendlier and service speed was up to par. It took 18 minutes to be served from the time we were seated(we timed it), and then another 20 minutes for food to be served a burger and french dip. Food we ordered because we thought they'd be served fairly fast. The AB was moderately crowded with business types and ASU students/staff on their lunch hour and has a pleasant decor. Very trendy indeed. We were able to wolf-down our lunch and head back to the Student Center at ASU for our meeting in an hour. Not a relaxing meal - again, slow service, loud atmosphere (turn down the music - it's lunchtime, not happy hour!), and expensive and very forgettable food. Do not recommend - there are MUCH better options for a good lunch in central Phoenix - at a lower price point.

Food is good, if you like thin crunchy pizza crust, but service needs lots of work. Too much socializing between servers and patrons. I actually said to our latest server that I was "Sorry to interrupt her socializing, but could she bring our table another round" of drinks. She didn't even realize I had cut her off at her knees... I don't recommend this hipster haven...Another server was standing out front of the business when we left, having a helluva argument on her cellphone, complete with f-bombs and loudly stating that "you're broken, dude! to the broken dude she was arguing with on her cellphone. . Nothing against youth, but this place is truly Hipster hell, not for people in their late forties like me and my dinner companion. Hire servers with maturity.

Medium cheesesteak with everything sweet. Excellent flavor, great portion size, friendly service. Food could be just a little warmer. Really enjoy the cheesesteak, as a Philadelphia boy!

Had a ham and Swiss cheeze omelet, breakfast potatoes, and an English muffin for brunch today. Omelet was fluffy, potatoes were nicely seasoned and hot. Portion size was good... I was full when I left. Cheap and filling... Total cost was $10 - with tip. Service was fast and attentive.   Decor of the restaurant was somewhat drab, however. Needs more pizazz. Recommend
