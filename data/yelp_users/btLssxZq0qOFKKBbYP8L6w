Well.  WOW.  I honestly can't believe how good this place is.  I have been a long-time fan of Carolina's so I feel bad for saying this, but Rito's beats it hands down.  I went for the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style (I meant to specify green sauce but I didn't so it came with red) and it was amazing.  I can't wait to try it again with the green sauce.  My friend ordered two shredded beef tacos...and wow.  You can't go wrong here.

I agree with the other reviews.  John and his team do great work.  I was having trouble passing emissions and I took my car to the Hyundai dealer twice with no success.  John looked at it and within 5 minutes was able to tell me exactly what was wrong.  No gimmicks and great prices.  I trust him 100%.

I love Luke's! This location is the best by far. I've been to others and for some reason the food here is always better. The Italian Beef (hot, sweet, and juicey) is amazing. The fries are amazing. The hot dogs are pretty dang good too, but the hot dog itself could be a little better. Not sure which brand they use, but that would be my only minor complaint. Not that the hot dogs aren't enjoyable because they absolutely are...heck, I eat them all the time! I'm just saying that I've had other Vienna Beef hot dogs that tasted a bit better. Maybe they're boiled instead of grilled? Overall though, you can't go wrong. I'm a big fan! Keep up the good work and I will keep coming back!

I can't say enough good things about this place.  I love their Martinis, and I love that when you're halfway done with your Martini they bring over another cold glass to replace your existing warm one.  The service is outstanding.  The ribs are amazing, but for $30 they shouldn't be anything but.  I do agree that Hillstone is on the expensive side, but I believe you're getting what you pay for.  Even their sushi is some of the best in town.  It's certainly my favorite.  Is it expensive?  Yes it is, but it's also amazing.  At $13-$21 a roll, it better be damn good!  The cheeseburger and chicken sandwich are very good as well.  You really can't go wrong here.  If you don't like it....I'm thinking the problem isn't the restaurant.

Man, this place is just good.  I don't know if it's a European, American or Polish deli, but the sandwiches are damn good.  Hell it could be called Best of Antarctica Meats & Deli and they would still have some of the best sandwiches in town.  When you buy a sandwich, you actually get two, so keep that in mind.  The sourdough bread is amazing.  The cold cuts are very high quality and delicious.  I purchased a few Polish sausages to go and made them at home later.  Wow.  Impressed.

Had a Saturday morning tee time on 6/27/15 @ 6:32am.  My friend and I arrived at 6:15am, paid for our round and headed to the first tee.  There was not a soul in site.  What is the natural thing to do on a course?  TEE OFF.  The course was wide open and there were only two of us.  Once we get to the 2nd hole and are about to tee off the "Starter" comes flying over and tells us we need to go to hole 10.  Why on earth do we need to do that when we're a twosome and there's nobody ahead of us?  Use some common sense.  So we argue with him then go all the way back to the 10th tee where he says we need to pair up with another twosome that's going off at 6:32am.  Well 6:32am rolls around and this other twosome is nowhere to be found, so what's the natural thing to do while golfing?  TEE OFF.  We played the back 9 quickly and everything went great.  Now we get back the first hole (which we already played) and the starter yells at us for not waiting for the other twosome on hole 10.  Really??!?!  It's our fault your other twosome was late?  Not only was he rude, but there were 4 foursomes waiting to tee off on the 1st hole and he wouldn't let us play through!  We're already on the course playing our round and you're making us wait for 4 foursomes????  We left immediately.  Complained to the Pro in the clubhouse and he couldn't have cared less.  I will never play here again.

This place is not good.  At all.  I got the Green Chile Burrito and my friend got the Carnitas.  Both were fairly flavorless and the meat was a bit dry/tough.  I really have no idea how this place has a 4 star rating.  That being said, the staff is very friendly and the service is great.  The food just isn't very good.

Shady's is a great little neighborhood dive.  The people are friendly and the bartenders too.  Nice place to get together with friends for a few drinks.  Great price on Session lager :-)

Without a doubt the best Mexican food in Phoenix. Well...maybe not better than Rito's, but you can count on it being open a lot more! The majority of their menu items are the best in town. Can't go wrong with the Green Machaca...melts in your mouth. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better chicken taco. Anytime I'm close, I stop in for a bite to eat. A Phoenix must.

I agree with the other reviewers.  The girl working at the counter was not friendly.  I ordered one of their sandwiches and I asked if they could please add prosciutto to it.  She replied with "no, we don't mix meats".  Really?  Pretty sure I'm the customer and if you're not willing to give me what I want, I won't be back.  Hence, I'm never going back.  The sandwich would have been much better if they made it the way I requested it.  An Italian sandwich with just one meat?!?  It was bland.  Bread was hard and flavorless.  My friend loves Italian food and he got the Rigatoni Bolognese, which he thought was OK but nothing special.  DeFalco's is better, especially for sandwiches.  Oh, and do not order the tripe, I think the reason is self explanatory.

What this place does, it does well.  The tortas are huge and flavorful!  If you're looking for healthy, you won't find it here.  If you're looking for a gnarly, greasy, massive sandwich, you came to the right place.  Hungover?  This is your spot.  On a diet?  This is not.  I recommend everybody try it at least once.

This place is gooood! I had the New Yorker with turkey and pastrami and my friend had the Factory Special, an Italian sandwich. We were both very pleased. The sesame bread is amazing and so are the meats. One of the best sandwich spots in town. You won't be disappointed.

For what you get, Georges can't be beat.  At least in the valley.  The gyros are huge, affordable and very flavorful.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  They make a good hot dog too.  I dig it.  I'm a simple man.

This place is fantastic! Love the pizza! Best in town?? Debatable...but very good nonetheless. Good beers on tap and a good wine selection. Wonderful atmosphere and great location. 4 stars!

Had a great lunch here today with friends.  I got the soft shell crab sandwich and I really enjoyed it.  Started off with the Teeter Tots and the Kimchi which were both extremely flavorful.  A friend got the chicken curry dish and he really enjoyed it.  Next time I'll be trying the Pork Belly Buns for sure!  The atmosphere is great and so is the food.  I highly recommend it.

NEVER AGAIN. So I was here the other day and I ordered a sandwich that had two different kinds of meat on it (#5 Vito). Instead of salami, I wanted turkey. Pretty simple right? Take one meat away and add a different one. When she told me the total it seemed about $2 too high. When I looked at the reciept I noticed they charged me $2 for the turkey? Wait...I took one meat away and subbed turkey...there's a charge for that?!?! Apparently so. I'm not sure I understand the philosphoy behind this, but I don't agree with it and I'll never eat there again. Only makes sense that if you take one meat away you should be able to sub another for no additional charge.  I was told that their sandwiches are made a certain way to assure speed and accuracy. Does reaching down into the turkey bin instead of the salami bin really affect speed that much? Come on!

This food here is pretty good. I give it 4 stars because I have had better Chinese food in other cities, but for Phoenix (which lacks quality Chinese food in general) it is actually quite good. The fried rice is OK, could be better (more fried)....it tends to be a bit more on the steamed side. The Mongolian beef is good but it's not seared/crispy the way I like it. The flavor is still very good though. The Lo Mein is quite good as well. The fried spring rolls that come with the lunch specials leave a little bit to be desired. Overall I do enjoy the food here very much. For Phoenix, it is quite good. Prices are reasonable as well. I recommend it.

Oh shoot!  This place is legit.  Had dinner here with a friend two nights ago and all I can say is WOW.  We started off with the Crispy Pig Ears and they were great.  Crunchy and flavorful with an amazing sauce.  The spicy peppers added a great little kick.  These can easily be picked off if you're not into heat.  I chose the 3 course option and ordered the Brisket, Semolina Gnocchi and Albacore.  Every single dish was amazing.  I'm not one to go into full detail about the garnishes and how the different flavors complimented one another blah blah.  Let's just stick with.....Crudo is pretty damn good.  But the Bourbon on the rocks I was drinking did, however, compliment the dishes very well.

This place is so good. Family-owned and the food is excellent. Very friendly and attentive staff. I've been here 6 times now and it has been wonderful every time. I've tried the Chicken Shawarma, Beef Shawarma, Falafel Sandwich, Taboule Salad, Lentil Soup, Jalepeno Hummus and they were all fantastic. It truly is a hidden gem in North Scottsdale. Very reasonably priced as well. Definitely worth trying!

Solid breakfast. Is it so good that it warrants all the attention it gets?!? Absolutely not. But like I said before, solid breakfast. Nothing fancy, just plain old good breakfast items that are done right.

Ambiance is pretty cool.  And the food is pretty good.  I mean, you don't walk out thinking "holy s*** that's the best taco I've ever had", but it's still quite good.  Salsa and sauces are nicely done and the drinks are top notch.  They have a great little selection of "gourmet" tacos.  Check it out!

Awesome beer selection and great burgers.  World famous?!?  Well, that's a bit of a stretch.  I think there are other burgers here in Phoenix that are just as good.  I'm not saying I've come across one that's much better, but definitely on the same level as this.  That being said, if you're looking for an amazing burger joint, this is one of them.  Pair it up with the awesome beer selection and that's what makes this place a cut above the rest.  It's a great location in a great neighborhood.  Prices are fairly reasonable but anytime you go above the $10 mark for a burger, it's a problem.

Alright.  This place is every bit as good as people are saying it is.  Just finished my "to go" box back at the office and I thoroughly enjoyed it, which is a rare occurrence with sushi.  It was fresh, tasty and very appealing.  I'll be going back soon to dine in and sample a few more of their offerings.  In the mean time, get your butts to downtown Phoenix and check it out.  Pretty sure you'll be happy you did.

Believe the hype.  And go at 10:30am or 1:15pm or don't go at all.  Any later and your trip will be for naught.  Werd to your mother.  The beans are key.

This place is old school...there's finally a REAL barber shop in town. From the vintage style to the dapper cuts, you can't go wrong. The products they use are the best in men's grooming. They also carry Shiner Gold which is the best pomade out there. Locally produced in PHX from all natural ingredients. These guys know their trade very well, and I genuinely look forward to my every other week fade. They are great with beards as well. Keep up the good work fellas!

BURGERS! BURGERS! I love the burgers.  Had an amazing burger here over Super Bowl weekend and the chef came out to make sure he prepared everything to our liking.  Very enjoyable experience.  It's definitely a place worth frequenting!

This place is gooooood!  The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing.  The gyros are def the best in town.  Salads are freaking HUGE!  They even handed me two coupons for my next visit.  Safe to say I'll be using those soon!  Highly recommend.
