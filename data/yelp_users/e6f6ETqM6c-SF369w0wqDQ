It's my fault. I knew going to jack in the box after midnight meant the milkshake machine would be cleaning and the made to order burgers would be warmed up and made to be reheated. My ultimate cheeseburger had fresh sauce but it was not able to cover the old burger patty lukewarm taste.

I have never been to a LGO. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. They made some great suggestions and made sure I knew all of the options. The dining room staff member seemed to really enjoy what he was doing, kept all the tables clean and worked very fast and efficiently. The cookies are HUGE and tasted great and fresh. The burger is more of a slider when it comes to size. So you may consider getting a side. Most of the guests I saw in the dining area ordered freshly made pizzas that looked outstanding! I would stop by here again when visiting the airport!
