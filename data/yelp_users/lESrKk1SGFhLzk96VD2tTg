Pretty sure just thinking about the chicken chimi with salsa con queso right now is enough to make me wanna head there for lunch.  Highly recommended.

Stopped in today with my boyfriend and our 6 year old.  I ordered the green chili burro chimi style.  Sour cream and Guac on the side.  As I cut into my burro, it literally deflated.  My curiosity led me to open the chimi, where I found 5 cubed pieces of green chili beef. 5. 5 quarter sized piece of meat in a full size tortilla.  I ordered the burro chimi style cause I like a crispy shell.  This was not the case.  After finishing my 5 with meat bites, I ate mushy tortilla with some semi par green chili sauce, and ONLY because I hadn't eaten all day, and I am pregnant.  And for $7, I couldn't throw it away.  But I will never buy it again.  My boyfriend and the wee one both had shredded beef tacos. Nothing terrible, pretty decent, I would of rather had the tacos.  He originally wanted a shredded beef burrito, sans beans.  The guy looked at him and rather rudely replied 'well we can do it but the burrito won't be big...'  Seems like a pattern here.  In addition... if you're charging me for a steak burrito, I don't want a bean burrito with some steak in it, I want a steak burrito with some beans in it.  If your informing customers that without the "filler" it won't be much of a burrito... it isn't a good sign.  They also don't take credit or debit which is a huge pain.  It wouldn't be as bad if they had an ATM, but they don't, so we had to order based on the little cash I had in my wallet.    We got my meatless fake chimi, 6 tacos and 1 soda for $21.  The tacos were not that big.  Skip it.  Or drive the block or so extra to Rosita's.

I've been going to Jonathan for about 6 years now with a few mishaps in between... and I can't stay away.  It is a little pricy, but that's because they seem to know how you want your hair to look more then you do.  Everytime I've tried to save some cash on my hair I've had to walk-o-shame back into Salon Bossa Nova to have Jonathan correct it.  And he laughs at me and fixes me and I leave with the most amazing cut and color that I wonder why saving $30 seemed so important in the first place.  I have only been to him, and he is the owner, but Ive observed many a haircuts in my time there (my appointment takes about 2-2.5 hours) and I've never seen a disappointed customer.  Oh, and they will go next door and get you something to eat or drink while you're drying or waiting or whatever.  Again, absolutly love this place, fantastic work EVERY TIME.

Just got back from this little place, went to lunch with my boyfriend. We went for the lunch buffet, which unfortunately ended a half hour before we arrived, but we decided to stay anyways. It was a very good decision.   Oddly enough, we were the only people in the restaurant, but I'm guessing that's because of its off the beaten path location. It's tucked in the plaza next to Tempe Cinemas, SE corner of McClintock and Elliot. Logan was the bartender/server, friendly enough, good service.   I had the Italian Beef sandwich which was AMAZING, best I've had since I left Chicago 5 years ago. My boyfriend had the Italian Wedding soup, loved it, and this ravioli dish which I can't remember the name of but its cheesy with butternut squash in a cream sauce, says its the best he'd ever had.   We finished with a coffee, a latte and some tiramisou (never could spell that word) and were stuffed and satisfied. The total bill came to just under $40 and was worth every penny.   I am the worlds pickiest eater, and I definitely loved everything I ate. We will be back =)

I have not found a better place for a sandwich yet.  The turkey bacon avocado is so good that I think about ordering it the next day while eating it for lunch.  The meat is Boar's Head- awesome.  The breads are amazing, the sauces are delicious and the side dishes are incredible! There isnt a single thing I have ordered that I didn't like.  They don't deliever, but it is worth the drive I assure you.  If you are hungry, go there.  Right now.  Seriously, stop reading and go to Z-Cafe.  Order the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Ciabatta.  Thank me later =)

Went there today after yelping for a new tasty lunch spot and stumbled upon a few reviews that made me immediately get up and go.  I followed the advice of several others and started with the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket, and it was sooo worth it.  It was the freshest, most flavorful sandwich I've had in a very very long time.  The steaming does take a little longer then the typical Subway employee but it is sooo worth it, and really not that long of a wait.  I've waiting much longer for late night fillie bees and never been as satisfied.  My boyfriend had the club on a sub which was also amazing... the meat tastes so much better steamed. It literally melts in your mouth.    I would of given 5 stars, but the pickles tasted a little weird, chip selection is so so and the signiture firehouse cherry-limeade... definitly pass.    Overall though, I didnt come for the sides, I came for the sandwich, and the sandwich was amazing.  Even if this place is out of your way you need to at least try it.  My money says you'll be back =)

I went there today, and as a person who avoids doctors unless absolutely necessary, this place reminded me why I believe it is usually just a waste of time and money.  Wait time was 30 minutes, not awful, but long compared to other urgent care centers I have been to.  I was quoted a copay of around $80, which I expected.  Went back to see the doctor, she looked in my ears, and at my throat, listened to me breathe and then told me to just use some otc meds and see my pcp if I wasn't better in a week.  I have already been sick for 4 days.  My visit took all of 5 minutes, no tests were run, or labs were done, nothing other than the things mentioned earlier, and time to pay... $140.  How the hell did it go from $80 to $140??  I could see if I had a test done or if that included medication, but no.  With my insurance, I paid $140 for the doctor to tell me just to keep on doing what I am doing.  Later I find out that 2 other coworkers, who have had the same symptoms, for the same length of time, also left work early, both tested positive for the flu.  I sit next to them at work.  They both left 2 different urgent cares WITH antibiotics, for $75, and a flu diagnosis.  We have the same insurance. So basically I spend $60 more to see an incompetent doctor who misdiagnosed me and now I get to go to another doctor, and it WILL NOT be a NEXT Urgent care.  Thank you for wasting my time and my money,

While visiting a relative staying at the biltmore I made an appointment to get my eyebrows waxed.  I paid $40 for something I could of done with tweezers and my right hand.  And Im a lefty.  Better off with the $7 nail salon special, trust me.    I would have only given 1 star, but I really liked the wax they use.  No soreness or messy red bumps after.  Earned them an extra star.  Maybe they can just tell me where to get the wax from?

Very quaint little bar tucked into a plaza and hard to see, but worth the trip.  They have some random beers on tap, which is always a plus, and a good selection of vodka flavors, which makes every bar better.  The best part of the bar is the bad ass back patio.  There are plenty of tables, room for groups, and it's overlooking a cute man made pond located between the bar and the apartments across the way.  Anytime you can be somewhere in Arizona looking at a body of water, it's a plus.  Perfect place to day drink.   In addition.... the burgers (which are amazing without this fun little detail) all come on the pretzel bun.  Freaking delicious.  My boyfriend is addicted.  As far as the appetizers go, definitely don't leave without trying the buffalo chicken ranch dip.  I went with some friends, and we did some appetizers, and we ordered one and ended up going through three (there were 10 of us).  It is that good.  It's a wonder more places haven't come up with a creation like this.  We also had the wings, naked and extra crispy, with sauce on the side.  They were delicious.  Just remembering them right now sorta makes me wanna stop in and get some... perhaps I will, and you should too!
