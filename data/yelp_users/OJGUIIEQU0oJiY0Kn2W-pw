Don't trust them! I've had 2 family members part of the VA Hospital and neither have come out alive or healthy. They are part of depopulating humanity by targeting the elderly. "Drug them up and send them home" should be the motto. No actual health care being done anymore! Such a Shame we can't even trust our own health care system!  Once again, thank you Obama Care, for being absolutely worthless!

This hospital is a joke! I took my bestfriend to the ER and they took an hour to get her in the back while 2 patients sat in the waiting center and 20 nurses sat on their asses chatting about nothing. When we finally got to the back, Dr. Kaufman (btw he won't do anything for you!) questioned her and said he might not be able to find anything. I told him that she had high anxiety along with suicidal thoughts and I didn't want her leaving the hospital without some sort of anxiety medicine. He gave me a HUGE attitude and told me to let him do his job, which he wasn't! I then told him to do his job and stop giving attitude. He'd rather sit here and argue back and forth so I told him that if she leaves here and commits suicide that it's his fault. Funny thing is, he said it wouldn't be his fault and that he could have thrown me out because our conversation was going nowhere. He has no justification in throwing me out for being concerned! I'd be understandable if I shouted foul language his way, but I didn't and he acted like a child by running to get security. I asked the security officer for the doctors first name and he told me "NO you can't have it!"or else he'd have to escort me out! Are you kidding me right now!!! Worst doctor ever!!!! Actually Banner is known for useless, lazy, and inconsiderate employees! I've never been to a worse facilitation! They also gave her morphine while she had alcohol in her system!! I'll be speaking with a lawyer. Banner should be used to it after being sued over 143 times this year! Pathetic!

Complete waste of my time. Spent 30 minutes driving there for them to accept 2 things out of 50. I went through my closet trying to trade out items that I still currently wear, and out of all the things they took was a pair of skinny jeans and side purse. The way they configure which clothes are worth value is beyond me because the things they kept were my least favorite and not even new. I still had tags on a bunch of summer dresses I got within 3 months and they wouldn't even take those. They were all really cute tank top dresses! Never going there again! If I'd recommend any place for trading in clothes, it'd be Plato's Closet or Poshmark.

DISAPPOINTED!!! I'd give this establishment no stars if I could. Normally Cold Stone is known to have fantastic customer service, but this is by far the WORST one I've ever been to. I really wish I had checked the reviews before wasting my time, and especially money, coming here. The employee working, whose name is Christian, was awful when it came to customer satisfaction.   To start off, my husband and I walked in, to not be greeted properly until he had fished his conversation with a friend, as if the customer is unimportant. Next, I tell him I want one regular waffle bowl and one chocolate, to go with our ice cream and mix. I then tell him I want cheesecake ice cream, with strawberries, bananas, and cheesecake bits. He grabs a scoop full of cheesecakes bits and literally put 5 tiny bits in my giant bowl of ice cream. So I ask for a little more and of course he ends up charging me extra. So after he puts together all my mixings and mashes them together, he doesn't ask which bowl my ice cream goes in and just drops it in the chocolate waffle bowl as I'm saying "wait! Wait! Wait!" And drops it in anyways. Then tells me that "is this just fine, or else I have to make it all over again; I can't just swap out the ice cream." I can't believe how serious he was! So I tell him it's fine, and he acts like he is doing me a favor by saying "well I'll just give it to you for the same price as the regular waffle bowl." He didn't even mix my ingredients well! They were still in chunks, bunched together on one side of my dish :( my ice cream came to $7.12 when it's normally just under $6.   Next is my husbands ice cream. Christian (the employee) doesn't have any sort of vanilla type ice cream, placed out, nor wants to get it. I know for a fact he has some in the back, but when my husband asked for it, he says they don't have any, and persisted to rush us, as if we were taking too long to figure out what "other" ice cream he wanted instead. Christian decided to be a lazy, worthless employee, and decided he just didn't "WANT" to go get the ice cream; probably because he has a closing shift and doesn't want to deal with filling the empty ice cream slots (which were quite a lot) It's too much extra work for him. That was some straight up Walmart customer service. Absolutely poor!!!! So anyways, he asks what toppings my husband wants, in a rude manor, then gathers them, and of course skimps his toppings too, then doesn't mix them well at all, once more. Our $15 ice cream was already melting and I hardly had any toppings, along with the wrong waffle cone! What an incompetent, selfish, lazy, worthless employee! He was such a dick and lacked complete customer satisfaction. I will not be spending any more funds at a local Cold Stone. I will be sticking with DQ after this poor experience. Do yourselves a favor and fire your employees or shut down!!!!

Worst Walgreens I've ever been to. I would never recommend getting your prescriptions filled here. The pharmacists don't communicate, nor do they care to do their job. Whatever happened to the 1 hour promise time? Yeah, try waiting 2 hours and having your prescription still not ready! It wasn't even all there! I can't believe the lack of customer service by these incompetent employees. Is every business doomed lately!? I'd fire them all and hire people off the streets who may have actually read a book and don't waste thousands of dollars on an education they could care less to utilize! I've met bums with a higher education level and motivational drive. Do your job, and stop pacing back and forth waiting for someone to tell you to do it!

Great place to buy, horrible place to sell/trade. This store is filled with all sorts of unique and lost treasures, you wouldn't expect to still see around. I loved this store the moment I walked in based on what they carried. However, I do have issues with the way they run their trade/sell department and the attitudes of a few employees, or better yet, lack of customer service. Their website is misconstrued and bares false advertisement on the items they accept.  Meanwhile, I pack 3 boxes of old items they say they accept and drive all the way over there to see what this place is about. However, I end up wasting my time for a measly $12, while 2 boxes of items weren't "accepted" due to daily inventory sales and seasonal calls. I was told to call ahead (which I did) to see if they'd accept several items, and that I should bring them in so they can have a look at them. Then I'm told they can't accept 2/3 of what their website says they'd take. The employees don't seem to care a whole lot when you bring in your old collectibles or dusty books, and have an unprofessional manner when letting customers know that their trade/sell is complete. Several employees actually carried the "I'm better than you" attitude on their shoulders and snarled when too many questions where asked. EXCUSE ME FOR NEVER HAVING BEEN HERE. So if you want to sell or trade at Bookmans, make sure you call ahead and see if it's the appropriate "time" or "season" for them to accept your items, or you'll be one of MANY to waste your time in selling/trading. My first experience here was awful. I hope this helps anyone else who has never been here, before they go.

Every time I come here, they say it won't be too long because they aren't busy. I've been here for 5 hours while their staff has yet to take my temperature and vitals, let alone assist me when needed. I mean isn't that what the health care system has come to, right? Just drugging your patients and getting them out as fast as possible? Seems like it....   Anyways, I've been in pain while these uneducated, lazy, and inconsiderate individuals watch me suffer and cry in agony. I actually pay for my insurance, hello!!!!! I've called the nurse three times for pain reliever. It wasn't until I started complaining and questioning their ability to treat patients, that I got the attention of not only one nurse, but 3 and a doctor. I asked why no one had come to let me know what was going on or to at least give me an update and he said "well sorry". What kind of medical doctor turns his patients away because of a few F Bombs? If you hadn't known, FUCK is used to describe a level of emotion! Treat me with respect and maybe you would have received the same treatment. We are both humans, one not better than the other. I help people in my own way and you should be helping those in the form you chose as a career in! I might have understood if the hospital was busy, but once again, I was the only patient on my floor and had 4 nurses listen to me complain and never get me temporary pain reliever! They sat on their fat, lazy, worthless asses and gossiped about the latest news.   WARNING AMERICA: This is what the health care system has come to! With that being said, this is by far the worst hospital that I have ever been to. You're made to feel worthless by supposed "professional" doctors and in the end, are drugged up and rushed out; unless you swear of course for lack of treatment, then they won't treat you or further delay it. If you want depopulation just ask Bill Gates for his special vaccines instead of pretending you care about people's health! Courtesy of Obama Care and the lazy, useless, unprofessional, disrespectful members that follow him. Thus, he has succeeded in demolishing the middle class, and putting them at the end of the totem pole to suffer like the poor. Yet, here me and my family are, not living off food stamps, social security, or access, and receiving worse treatment then illegals.   I'm sure Benjamin Franklin would be ashamed that we couldn't keep the republic to which we declared. And so communism begins.....

I'm surprised this McDonald's hasn't shut down. Does anyone know how to make a Vanilla McFlurry with strawberry toppings?!?! Can anyone count back change!?!?! Hm... Can anyone pay attention and do their job instead of giggling in the microphone where people can here you!?!? Not this place!!! Wow society has definitely downgraded in educating teens these days. Oh and that stereotype about low life's working at McDonald's, NEWS FLASH!, it's not a stereotype if it's true!

Absolutely Love! This Starbucks has a  genuinely charismatic staff, who after a week of continuity going there, remembered my order and began addressing me by my name. I appreciate quality customer service, and these guys got it down! Especially the morning crew :) thank you for your amazing service!

Absolutely the worst Harkin's Theatre I've ever been to. My first encounter with their poor customer service representatives was when my phone had had accidentally been left at their theatre. Calling prior hand, they said it was alright that I come get my phone even though their theatre was closing, so I immediately rushed over. When I had arrived, their were people behind the doors cleaning and walking around as I sat there for 30 minutes knocking and trying to get them to answer, just so I could have my phone back. They continued to ignore me, so I'm already unsatisfied with their lack of communication and effort to help me out.  The second occasion I've been to this theatre was today..... and it will absolutely be my last! After purchasing our tickets, 15 minutes before the movie started, my husband and I waited at the concession for 20 minutes in 1 line while customers, not even standing in line, where called over to order before us. Frustrated as can be, when I finally got to the counter 25 minutes later, I asked the inconsiderate employee behind the counter if she could hurry up and that she had been wasting my time cleaning up pointless messes instead of getting my order. She smiled and looked around me at other customers giggling as I'm handing her my rewards cup. She is still not attending or paying attention to what I'm asking her..... She gives me a sarcastic attitude and asks me to taste the Dr. Pepper (clearly the only thin I wanted!) in case i might not like it.... Still wasting my time.... Then asks me if I want nachos or anything else.... Still wasting my time! I tell her NO and to hurry up and give me my drink, so then I hand her a 5.00$! She puts the whole thing in her drawer and says "have a nice day" once again smiling and being sarcastic! I tell her she needs to give me my change! Um.. I'm sorry, since when did refills cost 5.00$ instead of 1.50$! She says "whoops, (with a smirk) let me get my TL," and then giggles again. Clearly wasting my time!! Her TL comes over already giving me attitude because this inconsiderate, unknowledgeable, and retarded employee can't do basic math skills, and tells me he will handle her later. I told him that he should because she is being extremely disrespectful, but he retaliates back and has the nerve to tell ME, the CUSTOMER that I'm being the disrespectful one. I then ask for my money so I can leave because of his pompous, gay-like attitude, so he shoves the cash in my hand and slams the change onto my drink. Message to BBB: send someone on this business immediately! They need to fire quite a few people!

Absolutely Unprofessional!!! When I arrived, the receptionist was very kind and welcoming. I showed him that my left long middle finger had a giant gash in it from when I was injured at work, and he told me that the physician would be back shortly after lunch. I waited an hour in pain, and when I finally saw her, she treated my wound by putting a band aid over it and super glueing the cut. Not only did she do that, but she googled what to do! She didn't even check if I had damaged any major tendons or nerves. I couldn't close my fist nor feel my fingers. Unfortunately, I now have permanent finger damage because I actually tore a tendon straight through, shooting the tube surrounding it, into the palm of my hand. Because of misdiagnosis I went back to work too soon, and should have been recommended to a hand doctor. It was so bad that the only recovery time period was in the first two weeks of my injury. Now I have a defective finger that won't close because they were unable to save the tendon. Thank you, uncertified doctor. If I wanted googles help to fix my hand I would have looked it up myself!

Absolutely love this place! The people are friendly and always smiling. I also haven't had a single problem with them for as many times as I go :D The food is delicious and worth the price you pay. If you'd love to try a delicious, greasy, fresh veggies, yummy, and fantastic burger, DEFINITELY go here! :) oh, and did I say delicious!? Well, D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!

Absolutely DISRESPECTFUL....I went in to get treated for a cold, but at the time I didn't have health care. When I asked the receptionists at the counter for an explanation on the programs they had to offer, they handed me a brochure with a list of them and said "here they are". Every question I asked afterword had a short reply or unknowledgeable one.   As I sat down waiting for her to make a copy of my ID, a woman came in and could hardly speak due to lack of breath. The previous health care clinic she had been to denied her, and when she asked if they could help or suggest somewhere close, their only suggestion was to go to the emergency room or find a way to come up with the money to pay for health care. The receptionists had no sympathy for this poor woman who could hardly stand. I would have offered her a glass of water and made a few calls to help get her to the right, affordable place. In a busy environment I might understand not being able to call around to a bunch of places, but I was the only other patient in there and witnessed them chatting and playing on Facebook. I'm quite shocked that they just hire any bimbo walking down the street. It's sad that society can't even do basic math anymore, let alone know how to do such as simple of a job as this one. Poor business management and lack of character.

Apparently every Next Care is useless. I wasted my $10 co-pay just for them to tell me I should go to the ER to have an MRI done. I explained that I have one in a few days and his response is that it seems like I should have it done now. Prior to handing them my co-pay, I told the woman I didn't feel comfortable paying if they weren't going to do anything, which they never do, and she said they have to take it, even for an initial evaluation. If you think telling me to go to the ER is worth someone's money, I could have asked the woman at the counter for that diagnosis. So I wait an hour after being asked a few questions and without proper treatment, sent to be someone else's problem. Mind you, this is after they try to suck up as much of my amazing Aetna health care funds by running useless procedures. What are these clinics for if their plan is to send you somewhere else? I already told you I had a doctors appointment in a few days! Listen to your patients and learn to do your fucking job! Every wanna be doctor sits on their lazy ass unless a bum comes in wanting his pain meds living off access. Once again, thank you Obama Care for creating access for worthless people to use up the health care system
