Yes I like this airport. It is NOT bad at all. I would give it less than 5 stars for a bit longer lines but they seriously go by sooo fast! I like how it's huge. I don't like small airports. Bigger means, they know what they're doing! They also have good looking guys here! Major +++ for eye candy! I'll definitely be flying here again. Well, I kind of have to since my brother and sister-in-law live in Arizona. They have plenty of stores and places to eat.

Just went in and had the absolute worst customer service ever at subway. Just because you probably got stuck working a Sunday night doesn't mean you have to emit that bitterness to the customer. I walked in and waited forever for someone to come out from back. Then someone finally came and this skinny white dude didn't even acknowledge my prescence. No hi, nothing! Long story short the kid made my sandwich with attitude. Never makes for a yummy sandwich! Now it's a shit sandwich which I'm still going to eat because I'm hungry! Ha. Then he checks me out and doesn't even hand me my sandwich and bag, I had to practically reach  over the counter to get it. Maybe if you're so unhappy with your life you should do something about it!

I enjoyed myself here. Typical grocery store. They have all the necessary things. Pretty cheap prices but I don't know much about produce prices. They have a variety of things including an array of beauty products. They had a pretty decent section for meats and seafood. Nice and slow in the afternoon. Perfect! The check out lady was really sweet.

Every time we go to Outback I forget how much I like it. I usually order some seafood dish or if I am in a steak mood, steak! The blooming onion is seriously the best! Ah such a good cheat food with the sauce. Yummy. The staff is hit or miss. Sometimes here they are friendly, sometimes so-so. We came on Christmas Eve as well and it was still pretty busy.

I've been to this place a couple of times while living in Arizona. When I first came I was impressed. The salsas are all amazing, especially the green one! The portions are HUGE! Enough to feed a small village. Nice Mexican restaurant decor. They have TVs to watch games. This is good Mexican food in Arizona. I will be coming back here when I visit.

I love Kabuki sushi! it's one of my favorite sushi restaurants and definitely top in Vegas beside Nobu. Nobu is on it's own level though so yes, top sushi restaurant in Vegas is Kabuki! My gfs and I always have dinner once here every time we make a trip out to LV. The cocktails are amazing and so are the sake! They have an amazing variety of choices between the cocktails, sake and food. The vegas roll is pretty good here and so are all the other specialty rolls. Great service as well!

I rally enjoyed myself here at this nightclub. My girls and I came here last minute and were just standing in line for about 5 minutes when one of the security guys called us over to cut the line. Sweet! The drinks were a bit overpriced but come on, it's vegas baby! Really nice bit set up. Loved the background outside waterfall wall. Really cool good looking people that come here. We met a ton of fun nice hot people and held a couple tables with. The staff and hostess were really helpful, but why wouldn't they be you know???? Not all of the outdoor tables were sold out. We actually left to bounce around and came back here at the end of the night before the after-after party lol. They were really cool. Overall made my Vegas trip a fun time!

My friend and I came here randomly. We had a wonderful time given we had no specific plans. It was one of those spur of the moment thing. An interesting crowd yes and there was a $10 cover charge, even to good looking people! lol. There weren't too many 9s or 10s but we did find our diamonds in the rough! Well worth it. Great DJ and the fog machine was mad fun. The drinks are reasonably priced and free poured.

I came here after I landed in Arizona and the first evening the food and drinks were wonderful as well as the service. The waiter was nice and helpful etc. Overall a good experience the first time. Then we had lunch there the next afternoon. Service was seriously horrible!! We had the rudest waiter, Brandon. He seemed as if he hated life, including his job. He never came back to check up on us. Some other guy brought us our food and he was a lot nicer and friendlier. I was tempted to ask for a switch. Anyone ever hear of a little thing called customer service??? I only gave it a two star rating solely because of that one experience but not for my overall accumulated visits there. Also I must say, I will continue to visit Yard House because it is a great establishment.

BOMB.COM x2!!! I am shocked that this buffet has a 2.5 rating. My friends and I were hungover and starving. We are all critical eaters and we were impressed! They had everything and every style of cooking. If you craving something, more than likely they have it! Granted my friends and I got a great deal on this buffet but so utterly great with a variety of everything. I will be coming back here!

I came here when my sister had my nephew. I'm not from here so I had never been. Starting with the positives, the hospital is pretty clean and newish. My nephew was born here hehe. The nurses in the infant intensive care area were very kind as well as one of the nurses for my sister. The cafeteria has pretty good food! The negatives...The waiting room for labor and delivery sucks. I wouldn't even call it that! All...and I mean ALL, with the exception of three nurses, have a major attitude problem. They stare you down like you own them something and I'm soooo serious! Back home in every hospital experience I've had, the nurses are kind and pretty accommodating! Don't expect that here! They sit behind their computers staring and staring gossiping. Get to work ladies!!!! And I say that because they're all female. Also, the security sucks here. Mr Sideburns, he thinks he's a real cop lol. Hmm that's weird I didn't know I couldn't take pictures of my sister leaving the hospital. These nurses as well as security need to go back to school for manners and etiquette! I will definitely be paying for my sister to try out another hospital next time!

Cool place to eat and have a beer or two. Maybe even catch a game. My friend and I came on a less busier afternoon. We had a pretty funny, cool entertaining waiter. Food was good with our mandarin salad and veggie patty burger. The waiter was nice enough to have our meals split and everything for us. Only 4 stars because we really didn't have anyone check up on us at all and it took forever for him to bring the bill, run our cards etc....

Love Pappadeaux!!! I really love the atmosphere here and the decor. It's usually packed here which I don't really care for but that means it's a yummy good place. They have amazing appetizers, the creamy dip and alligator! They have some yummy seafood entr√©es. Although I do wish they had more crawfish options. I love coming here.

How do I start?? So I came here the day before Christmas eve at the end of last year, we sat down yadda yadda, and our waitress came up to us after like 15-20 minutes and for some reason has a major attitude. That's not going to fly with me. She was like this uber short, midget short kinda, Mexican chick. We place our drink order, which takes her forever to get. A simple water isn't so hard or is it?? I get my water and blehhh it's tap water!! That b*tch! So we 'finally' place our order. Half of my parter ordered the chicken pot pie and I the steak salad. Then she comes back ten minutes later to tell us that they ran out of pot pies! Lol. Absurd, they're known for their pot pies! So they change their order. Then she comes back again about ten minutes later, saying there are two pot pies left haha oh man! Two people out of the 4 that ordered one said okay, I'll take the pot pie. Yet, we see I'm the window a little later, 5 pot pies sitting there! Horrible service by a horrible waitress! One star for my yummy steak salad;-).

I love this place. It's very spacey and roomy. My girlfriends and I usually come here after having dinner at the sushi restaurant downstairs. I love the variety of martinis that they have. I usually get the skinny bitch martini (under 25 calories!!)... It's super delicious with blueberry in it! They usually have a live band. Gets busy but not super crowded.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I love this W. Especially during spring training time. It was the best time of the year! This is definitely my kind of place. The pool, rooms, bars. It was a great experience here. Nice mini bar when in need, but it's only about a shot! Haha

I thought I had written a review from my visit in March but I guess not lol. My brother and his wife live in Arizona, so this is where we went right after I landed and our waiter was fabulous etc etc. I give it two stars for my first night experience, plus I love the company establishment etc. I would give it a one star or even none if I could for my second experience here. This rating is solely based upon my experience and not the establishment itself, because I am a fan of the Yard House. I had a horrible snobb stick up his a** waiter! He seemed like life was miserable. I mean everyone else, including the manager was amazing so I am sorry to give such a low rating, but like I said, it is solely based on my experience with this one waiter. I only wish I got his name, so I could warn everyone not to get served by him! lol. He seemed as if he was so miserable and he was taking it out on us. Let's see, i'll describe him. Black or dark brown spiky hair...caucasian, light skin, and snooty!

LOVE LOVE LOVE! So much fun here! This is a must for Las Vegas. I love the indoor and outdoor setting. Love the beds on the water. I love how there are so many people here to mingle with yet it isn't annoyingly crowded, and that's only because it's so big and roomy here! I love and everytime I come back to Las Vegas, I WILL be coming here!

I used to live across the street from this place and would always order the same thing. Yellow curry with chicken medium spicy. It was always on point and tastes just as I would imagine it does in Thailand! Ha. All orders come with rice. I would usually get it for pick up and it was always cooked super fast and ready in 10-15 minutes! The staff was always friendly and after a while even remembered me haha. I'll be coming here when I visit.

LOVED IT HERE!!! We had a table and the security took care of us all night! Ugh so nice! We even came in late and they were so nice, escorting us and all for how busy it was. So it was fun times, expecially since they played my favorite songs. They had hip-hop mixed with house and trance, amazing DJ!!!

Pretty awesome cupcake shop. If you don't have a sarcastic humor then you'd think owner/baker dude was pretty rude. I like the name, it's pretty funny, cool and creative. The sizes of the cupcakes are huge!

4 stars only for this being fast food, but boy is it good here!!!!! From the minute I walked in I was greeted by a friendly face offering help to decide what to choose from their extensive menu. They have so many options which is awesome. I served a drink and sat down and they came and brought me my lunch. The dining room area was nice and large for a fast food joint! I wish culvers was here northern Cali. Bummer! Lol

This forever is forever on steroids. Two story including men, plus size and kids! I love how it's all spread apart so on a crowded day it doesn't feel too crowded. It looks like it used to be an old Macy's or something but I'll take it! The jewelry section is huge as well. I think there are two dressing rooms, one upstairs and the other downstairs.

So I used to love this place but had a bad experience this morning. I went in yesterday evening for a fill with gel done wonderfully by Jenny. Literally last night a nail broke off so I came in first thing this morning to have that fixed. Not even a full 24hours. Quinn fixed the nail because Jenny was not in yet. Then all was fixed and proceeded to tip and then she said its $4! Literally I was just in and you're gonna charge me $4?!!!!!! I can afford $4 but it's the damn principle. I worded, $4 for a one day repair?! And then by this time Jenny was there and explained if she had done it it wouldn't have been $4. I didn't even have the option of you fixing it!!!!!! This is definitely my last visit here. I'm sure I can find a place with better quality, prices that won't rip me off.

I visited this location twice. The first time was awesome! We went through the drive-thru and the woman at the window was super nice and friendly. She went above and beyond! She was like a hawaiian or samoan descent. She was awesome!! Drinks came out perfect! No complaints. The next day however we came across a caucasian brunette female. She messed up our order, overcharged us and then we proceeded to inform her NICELY, then she copped major attitude. She 'literally' rolled her eyes. Who the hell does that???? lol. She made it such a hassle that we just said forget it, not even worth it.

Can you say, LAME!!! LOL. So there was a semi long line waiting for Surrender to open. Look in the line, NO good-looking people! I'm not mean or anything, don't mean to sound like a bitch but it was like the rejects that couldn't get into XS. We came in and it was completely DEAD! Drinks are super overpriced here, especially for being Vegas. I would come back to the Encore beachclub but I will definitely NOT be coming back to Surrender. Oh and another thing, tons of old ladies trying to dress and act young here and i'm not talking about the hot cougars either! If you're into that, then this is your place!

I love this place! Good deals, plus for having a large line and being packed they gave ladies an open bar for a couple of hours, and not the cheap nasty stuff. Good deal! Very roomy and once again, I am a fan of the indoor outdoor setup. I would come back here again!

Nice new stadium. Parking is a bit retarded but other than that it's SPRING TRAINING!!!! How can you complain??? Fun times, cheap tickets, good vendors. Only thing is the food and beers are priced like a regular season game, which is no big deal. A's versus Diamondbacks, A's won!!!!!

This is a cool bowling alley with a bar, large game area, live music, restaurant, large TVs and laser tag I think? Games are reasonably priced. I think I paid $30 for unlimited amount of games in an hour or so? Don't even know if that's saving a lot of money if even any but I'll go with it! Only sucky thing is if you're bowling, it takes forever to order drinks and to get them!

I love this place when I lived in Arizona. It was a great alternative to my California Mediterranean food! I loved my chicken pita with pita chips! Yummy! Juicy chicken. They also have a cilantro hummus which is THE BEST! Also I might add, I think it's the owner that's usually up front but they are always so nice and friendly!

These outlets are okay. I can't imagine on a hot day how it would be given it's outdoors. They have H&M, guess, Nike, Michael Kors...the list goes on. Parking is usually not bad except there's basically one entrance and one exit and everyone's walking around.

Not bad! This place is overwhelming at first! I love how the jewelry is organized by each color. Some of the items are overpriced for the quality but they have a variety...and I mean a VARIETY, to choose from. They also have cute scarves and some clothing options organized according to color as well. Love that! I definitely will be coming back for some jewelry for my Vegas trips.

Place is good for a food court counter. They have the typical gyro and lemon soup. Service was good and efficient. I didn't wait too long even though there was a long line.
