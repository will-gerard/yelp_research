They will forever be my favorite place to eat when I'm wanting pasta! Let's start with the bread. It's alway fresh and the butter is easy to spread Then the salad is great with the pesto ranch yummmm!  Every pasta I have gotten I've never been disappointed with. My favorite is the mizithra cheese on one side and meat sauce on the other. AMAZING!

No wonder blockbuster is going out of business. They arent very observant when i was needing help. they were very rude and didnt care to tell me all of the information i was looking for from them. its very dirty and not well organized.

I love their burgers and my favorite are the mahi tacos! (if thats how you spell it) you can get unlimited frys and every one is nice in there. The only thing is i think the prices are just a little too pricey for some of the things. Other than that they are a thumbs up for me!

NOT a fan of this Jack in the box at all! I went through the drive through and all i wanted was a milkshake. I was clear with my words and she had no idea what i wanted. She took forever to respond too. After she found out what i wanted, they werent serving it. This has happened a couple times now and its really annoying that their employees cant understand whats on the menu that i am ordering.

I love this place. I like the dim lights while I eat it's very relaxing. The bread is great! I like the variety. My favorite meal I like to get there is the Thai chicken pasta! Oh my gosh to die for. And any of their cheesecakes are worth getting! :)

I LOVE the look of Abuelos and the fun ceiling just brings everything together.   Abuelos was one of my first jobs when I was 16. It was not my cup of tea working there and quit 3 weeks later! After that I only went in 1 maybe 2 times a year. I never hated their food, it just wasn't first choice to go and eat.   So, about a year ago my boyfriend and I was next door waiting for a movie when we decided we needed food so we searched happy hours all around the area and decided to walk over to Abuelos. We were so happy about the prices and the happy hour food was great.  I love that they bring warm chips and different varieties of salsa. The main reason I love to come here are for their amazing sangria swirls! If you ever go to Abuelos, this is a must have!   We now go in so often that we know most of the bartenders and servers. :)

I hate getting tires for one thing so it's never going to be a fun experience but I needed them really bad and called discount tires and they said they could do it and when I got there they said no we are about to close. So I'm thankful that pap boys was open till 8 instead of 6 like the rest of them! The only thing they didnt do is rotate them for me.

just to get things straight. The only reason this place has a bad review is because of ONE nail tech that was fired. Everyone who works there besides this nail tech is amazing at everything they do! All of the hairdressers take their time and know what they are doing and the other nail techs they have are more than capable in making you happy!

I do not live near Village but when I am in the area, I make sure I come in here for coffee. I love that they have different milk substitutes because i cannot have milk and everything is fresh!   They know what they are doing there and they are always attentive to what you are wanting. Even if you are not sure, they will make it a point to get you what you are in the mood for.

I hope this place sticks around. It's a cute relaxing cabin feel too it and the employees and always friendly. Their smoothies are very good and the avalanches are really good too. my drink of choice that i always get is just a plain ole iced vanilla latte and its better than starbucks =]

Great wells Fargo. One of my favorite ones in this area. They make sure your taken care of as much as they can. Every time i go through the drive through they know i have a little one in the back and will always send a sucker out.

Great happy hour!  I live in the area and Oggi's is always on the pist of places to go for dinner.   They have great servers and every pizza I have gotten is very good!  They have their own brews and they are always at a great price and they hit the spot!  I definitely recommend Oggi's =] If it's going to be your first time there, get the garlic knots for an appetizer.

So this is my second time in here and I forgot how much I love their breakfast. First, they have a cute modern feel with outside seating. Second, they have great coffee! The pancakes are moist and not too filling and my favorite was the jalape√±o cornbread. I want to go back just for that!

I just have to say ive never been more happy at a gym. They owners are amazing and they have a great boys team and they make sure the staff knows what they are doing. The gym is big and open and its just a perfect place to put your kid from kindergym to team.

The only thing that's nice about this nail salon is the layout and pretty sky ceiling. Besides that, the people who work there don't give a crap, their massages are shitty and they burnt both me and my friends legs with their hot rocks. For what we got, their prices were outrageous! I won't pay a dime to come back here. They also told me my daughters polish change would be $3 and then charged me $5 without letting me know!

I dont know how someone can get a vanilla latte wrong but they did, twice. It wasnt horrible but it just tasted like milk. In Arizona where i live, i order that every day.  The great thing about this Starbucks is the friendly employees and its clean and the drive through line goes fast. Quick and to the point!

LOVE this place. Greatest concept!   Its fresh and you can put more or less of food you want and you can see them cooking your food instead of it being closed off not knowing whats going on back there!  Everyone working there is kind and upbeat and are always on top of things.    I cannot tell you enough to come and try this place! Its fun.

Okay, I get a starbucks pretty much every day. The same thing EVERYDAY. I had to go to chandler for a job and i needed my starbucks fix so i went into this one. everyone was nice and friendly and i think it is a pretty new starbucks.  They made my drink completely wrong so i politely went over and told them it didn't taste the same as my every day drink. She was nice to try and fix it but all she did was put it in the blender again and made it more watery. I tasted it again and then told her it just still wasnt the same. She got a little snippy and said that thats how its made and didnt care after that. So i went to a starbucks near by and asked if they could make a new one and it was exactly how its supposed to be made.

I've been here twice now and I've been impressed both times. Their happy hour is great with a nice selection of local beers.   They serve food till midnight and their food is GOOD!   The bartenders/waiters are respectful and professional and this place is clean with a great vibe!   ... And every second Sunday of the month is live music!  I will be here more often now :)

I just have to say that this is the most friendly coffee place that is downtown. Also, I cannot get their breakfast burritos out of my head! Best burrito I've had and they gave us an extra hot salsa that was to die for if you like hot stuff. I would buy the salsa alone it's that good.
