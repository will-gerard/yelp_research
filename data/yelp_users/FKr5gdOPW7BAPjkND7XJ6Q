There are few places that I have not out-grown since my ASU days and this has to be one of them. Their salad and slice special never gets old. LOVE the combo slice and the barbeque chicken slice. Also, if you've never seen anyone complete the 24'' pizza challenge... it is a must!

Rich in the print center is a lifesaver!  We came in at the 11th hour to get an important proposal printed. Rich was patient and helpful and let us know that an immediate printing would not be possible due to the time of day, but that he would come in early and make sure that our 7 packets would be printed on the correct paper and collated by our deadline. It was very refreshing that he cared enough to make sure that we were satisfied customers instead of simply sending our business elsewhere.  Everything looked great and we could not have pulled off our presentation without his help.

This place got me hooked to Pho Thai.  At one point I was there 3 times a week.  The owner is so personal and friendly.    The Pho Thai, spring rolls, and fried rice are to die for.  But everything else...no so much.  But the Pho has me hooked.  It gets crowded around lunchtime, so you might have to share a table or call ahead and get your fix to go.

This place is by FAR the worst nail salon I have ever been to. I found myself in a bind and needed to get a fill right away, so i stopped by here on my way home from work.  My guy was ok.  He made my nails uneven and lumpy, but that doesnt compare to the other things i witnessed. In the time I was there, i saw the guy who answers the phone and greets people (i assume the owner) provide the worst service ever.  He was filling a girl's nails and was on the phone the entire 15 min it took.  He never once asked her what she wanted or apologized for not paying attention to what he was doing.  Then while there were 2 other people waiting, he took the phone call outside and chained smoked cigarettes.  After that, I saw him fill one other person's nails in a total of 5 minutes.  I would stay away if you want to get your moneys worth.

What a hidden gem!! I've lived in Tempe nearly six years and can't believe I've never been to Spinato's before. Tucked into the industrial part of Tempe, it's hard to miss but you will want to make the trip. After getting my wisdom teeth out all I wanted was pizza and this place was a great choice to be re-introduced to the world of solid foods

Not only does the veggie burro rock my world, but the chips and salsa make my life complete. I easily eat here 1-2 times a week (as embarrassing as it is). It's the perfect place for lunch with the outdoor seating so you don't get that food smell on your clothes for the rest of the afternoon.

Best pizza ever.  Period.  They deliver late, and their crust flavors are all amazing.  I would also recomend the wings, the cheesy bread, and the cajun crust.

While the red velvet cupcakes may be mini (and good for my portion-challenged self) they couldn't be more delish!! The half asparagus and havarti panini and half harvest salad were an equally flavorful lunch option. But desserts clearly steal my heart away.

mmmm.... to die for grilled chicken and beef.  Then only thing better than Jay remembering your order is walking in before the lunch rush.  Cash is a must.  But oh so worth it.

San Felipe is my favorite happy hour spot. I love that ALL drinks are half price during happy hour every day.    The margaritas and appetizers are delicious.  Although there are always old ladies dancing and getting drunk... they don't bother me and only add to the ambiance.

There's something so amazing about drinking beer from a mason jar! The beer is decently priced and the food is delicious. The seasoned fries and sweet potato fries compliment their burgers perfectly. I also love the live music and the fact that everyone seems at home here.

After shopping around Valley for a car and stopping at a variety of dealerships, I can't even being to explain what a relief it was to find Peoria VW. After one sleezy used car salesman after another (at other dealerships of course) I was ready to give up my search for a new- used car. When I read the reviews on Yelp I thought they had to be too good to be true. I was prepared to be disappointed.   Bennett answered the phone and was friendly and personable. She assured me that the car would be ready for me to see when I got off of work. That personal touch was unlike any other dealership I encountered. Other dealerships tried to get me to commit to an appointment right away or pressured me to give my contact info.   Right from the beginning, Ron Dosch made me feel welcome. He explained everything about the car without being too pushy or "salesy". He was patient and informative throughout the entire process. There was no pressure at all for me to buy a car I wasn't happy with. The finance department was equally impressive, as they worked with me to find an interest rate I could live with. Again, other dealerships I've dealt with played games trying to give me interest rates that I knew I didn't deserve or tried to bully me into new cars or additional service packages.  I can't stress enough how much I will be recommending this dealership to everyone I know. It truly made buying a car a positive experience for me and is on a completely different level than any other dealership in the Valley.

I saw the chicken mole pizza on their website and was dying to try something so unique and bold. I called to order my pizza and gave my name and number and was told it would take about 20 minutes. When I arrived at the take out window, I had to wait about 5 minutes while the 3 cooks stood around until they could flag someone down to help me. When she arrived, she told me that they no longer made the mole pizza and tried to call but wasn't sure she had the right number...but I could choose another pizza to purchase and wait 20 minutes for. It wasn't busy inside and I can see why...Terrible customer service.

I LOVE this place.  After too many salon mishaps and 6 months of split ends, i decided to turn to yelp and hope for the best.  Usually, hairstylists treat me like a burden for my masses of thick, long hair. Or charge me some outrageous fee for having enough hair for 3 people.  But Jenna didn't even flinch when she saw what she had to work with.  Not to mention the head massage.  I also signed up for their email list and they send me discount offers. That I will definitely take advantage of next time I go.

I originally signed up for Ultimate Body Bootcamp in April 2011. After 3-4 months I stopped going because it was hard for me to make it after work and I was "sure" there were more convenient options out there. Basically...I had plenty of excuses.  Fast forward to February 2013, I had: joined and quit a gym, tired Bikram Yoga at every studio in the Valley, taken kickboxing and TRX classes and spent countless hours doing cardio in my apartment complex's gym. I realized that I hadn't found anything better and that I'm just not someone that can keep themselves motivated on my own. So I gave in and began taking classes at Ultimate Body Bootcamp again the following month.   What really keeps me coming back is the fact that I haven't reached a plateau. It's a killer workout and isn't repetitive because each class is different than the last. The class environment is fun, friendly and challenging. Richelle (the owner) is fantastic and encourages you to push yourself and really make each workout count. She is a wealth of knowledge about both fitness and nutrition.   I've been taking classes at Ultimate Body Bootcamp for nine straight months now and can say that I'm still just as sore after each class as I was the first week. I've made tremendous progress and am stronger than I've probably ever been. I can even say that I recently made the plunge into commitment and signed up for a full year of classes.
