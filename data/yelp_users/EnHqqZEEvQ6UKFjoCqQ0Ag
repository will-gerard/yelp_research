Very attentive to details with cuticles and nail trimming, cleaning etc. Was a little bummed out that they didn't pay a little more attention to the rough patch on my heel even when I asked. They kept suggesting callous remover....no thanks! After an application of that stuff my heels are way more dry and splitting by the next day. They also left me sitting and soaking in the bowl for over 30 min before someone started my service. This is why I didn't give 5 stars. However, I absolutely loved the finished product and artwork.  They also have a photo book of nail art you can look at which is great.  Price is great too!

The green chile quesadilla earned 5 stars on its own! BEST I have ever had. Lots of roasted fresh (not canned) chilis.   Taco salad was delish, so we're fish tacos and rice was really tasty. Fast and friendly service.

I booked this hotel because it was offered as one of the hotels on conference website. We were offered some extra perks, like a reduction in the resort fee, including a set of comedy tickets. When I called the resort to ask questions I was told the convention I was attending was a 5 min walk from there.  This was complete misinformation, it was well over a mile walk  to the convention center location. One of the reasons I took the time to call and ask about this is because I have some physical issues that made walking difficult for me and I was trying to be prepared.  I would have made other arrangements than walking in the heat of a nasty summer day if I had known this.    I Stayed in Monaco towers. Must have been the oldest dingiest part of the hotel. Bathroom floor looked dirty.  The room was sweltering hot when we  first arrived. The air conditioner must have been on it's last leg because it really never cooled off properly even after being on all night.  Every time we left for the day the cleaning staff turned it off so we returned to a hot stuffy room.  The pillows were small, flat and very uncomfortable, the sheets were scratchy.  The bathrooms featured the cheapest toilet paper and soap I have ever seen.  Felt like I was washing with Lava soap.  The gal who checked us in was rude and argued with me about including free comedy show tickets we were promised with our package, she finally acted like she was doing me a favor by giving the to me.     The morning of our check out I was just getting out of the shower and housekeeping opened the door while I was nude.  This was just after 9 am.  SERIOUSLY!!!  This was Sun morning, this Vegas, people are still  sleeping at that hour!!!!  Check out time was still an hour and a half away.  I will never stay here again and won't be recommending it to anyone.  Talked to the manager about the situation with housekeeping..she offered to remove the "hotel fee" which was $5. Gee thanks, at that point I felt I was wasting my breath discussing any other issues with her.  This was a business trip, I was hot tired and exhausted when I got back to my room.  I didn't have the time or energy to deal with this during my stay.  I realize I was not paying for luxury.  I wasn't expecting that, what I was expecting was a clean comfortable room that I could get a good nights sleep in.

What a disaster!  The only reason I gave one star was because there were no negative star options!  Definitely not a place to go with a large party.   We had a party of 13 and a reservation for 7:15 to have a celebratory dinner.  We all stood in the lobby waiting for our "reservation" for about 40 minutes. We were the wait was because they didn't have enough menus.  Really??? My bad, thought it was pretty standard to have enough menus for your guest.  It was about 8 pm before we even placed our orders. Every part of this experience was horrible.  Dinner/salads started coming out before the apps.  I never got the drink I ordered, we kept being told refills were coming which never happened.  Some of the dishes were just so awful they were inedible. 2 of our party ordered tri trip which looked like it had just been scavenged somewhere from the kitchen and thrown on the plate. It was so tough they couldn't chew it. I ordered the chicken parm pasta which was nothing like the description.  The breading was soggy and needed to be cooked longer and it was pretty tasteless. I was skeptical about even eating it wondering if I would get sick. The talapia and shrimp dish came out missing it's sauce.  Potatoes came with no toppings and the beef ribs were full of fat and rubbery.  We had to ask repeatedly for things like toppings and drink refills.  By the time they did bring toppings for the potatoes, they had to bring new potatoes because the original ones were cold.  The manager finally came over and started trying to help our waiter play catch up by bringing out drinks.  One couple had to share a glass all through dinner because their drink never came.  Our server was clearly in over his head and freaking out making it a very uncomfortable experience for all of us. His attitude and lip service was like we should share the blame for his misfortune of having to deal with our large party.  When the waiter asked if we would be needing separate checks he was very excited when we said no, one is fine. He then tells us, that's awesome, you guys just don't understand I'm dislexic and this is really difficult!  PRICELESS!    Our host was very upset because it was his intention to treat us all to a great meal and experience.  Unfortunately CJ has gone way down hill!  Meals used to be incredible and a very special experience.  Not the case this time.  Go somewhere else!!

Love doing business with Bertha!  Staff is always very helpful if you have questions, and they have a heart for the small business owner.  Great prices, super fast shipping (always get my items the day after I order).  Recently purchased the dermafiles and LOVE them.  Clients love the treatment and it has upped my facial revenues significantly.  They have paid for themselves over and over.  Much better investment for me than a micro machine!

Due to my inexperience I was a little intimidated to take a class. The positive energy of the staff and other students quickly made me feel welcome.   I took the beginner class and it has been great !  The instructor is very patient and gives excellent verbal instruction and coaching.  You never have to be concerned about not being able to keep up or understanding the lingo.  She also offers alternatives for every skill and experience level so you never feel awkward.  I am learning a lot and truly enjoying the positive effects on both the mind and body.   I have experienced new deeper levels of relaxation and would recommend Eleutheria for a great Yoga experience.  They offer yoga classes for every need, and even a belly dancing class!  I love that they make things really easy by offering online scheduling too.

I had an appointment, they suggested I arrive 15 min early to fill out paperwork.  I arrived there 20 minutes early.  They were an hour and a half late getting me back for my appointment. When I checked in with the front office girl she seemed very confused and unable to locate my appointment and had to ask someone else about it.  After sitting for an hour I re approached the same receptionist who again, could not find my appointment and acted as if she had never seen me before. (Which made me wonder if I had even been processed as checked in)  I watched the huge waiting room fill and empty twice before I was called back for my turn.   Waiting for an appointment for an hour an a half is not acceptable....in any circumstance.  I had an appointment which was scheduled in advance. Please respect my time. Im not sure why the medical field gets away with this crap.  It's not an e.r. you people do this everyday and should know how to mange your time and your staff.  The only redeeming quality was the back office staff. I saw two different techs, both were very professional and efficient and did a great job.  I also liked that they did not make u wait for results and told you on site.  As far as time management....get your act together!

Today I was in a hurry, so I decided to opt for FAST food.  Wendy's hit the mark.  Quick order process, quick payment process, and by the time I hit the window my order was handed to me.  It was even a special request. Everything was hot and fresh and just how I ordered it. Good job Wendys!

Don't believe what they tell you!    The dishwasher we wanted was out of stock.  We were told that it was in the local warehouse and in order to insure that we got one of those allotted to us we should prepay and we would have it in 2-3 days.   I pre paid and I waited four days and after I had no call ,no contact from Lowes I called them.  When I called, they said it would be available 3/29. Which was 7 days after I ordered it. So I wait the 7 days.... No call no contact from Lowes, so I call again. Well guess what.  Still not there. This time they tell me there is s delivery date of 3/31 (9days after we ordered it)  So much for it being in the local warehouse!! .  When we said that was unacceptable we spoke to an employee/manager in the appliance dept were told we could get another dishwasher instead, since they hadn't received the merchandise. They gave us the serial number of the model they would be giving us. When we arrived to claim the dishwasher they had offered us, we were told that we couldn't have that one they offered us because it was too expensive.  So, they offered us another lesser priced model. Who does business like that?????   What a crock!

We have been coming here since they opened.  I have enjoyed lots of sushi bars, but this one has the best salmon ever, its always super tender and melts in your mouth.  Tried the new Hawaiian roll today, it is amazing!  Great happy hour specials all night. This has become our favorite sushi destination.

The food and service here is amazing! Not traditional cookie cutter Italian food.  Chef Humberto is very creative with some of his authentic Italian dishes.  Sometimes he offers awesome special feature dishes, like the stuffed trout.  It's wonderful.  The tables have linen cloths and the service is great and not rushed. It's a relaxing environment, not meant to be rushed, but enjoyed. They even have an extra room to host events and special occasions.  I have eaten here several times.  I always try something different and I'm never dissapointed. The soups are always incredible. Shhhh, it's one of Litchfield Parks best kept secrets!

DON'T BUY anything here!  They told me my order would be here in 2 weeks, waited 2 months.  All due to them filing bakruptcy. They finally delivered the sectional and one piece is clearly used. Completely different color and cushions were all rumpled. They couldn't commit to being able to order a new corner piece. Then, suggested I refuse the order if I wasn't happy.  So, I never received the merchandise and they are still trying to charge my credit card, saying they can't do a refund..That I will have to fight it out in bankruptcy court!   Not sure how they can even charge something before they deliver the goods? Save yourself a huge headache and stay away!!!  Oh, and by the way...they are no longer offering warranties and their customer service dept is no longer in existence, so no one to call if you have probs, phone number disconnected.
