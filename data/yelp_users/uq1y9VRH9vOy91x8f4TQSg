Food was average. We had a quesadilla and a burger. Quesadilla was good, burger wasnt great. Not much flavor and a dry bun. The reason for the low rating vs average was because of 2 things. One of the waiters dropped a cup that had the liquid flying all over us. She looked at us and didnt say a thing and acted like nothing happened. Second, the lady at the bar was serving beers that she wiped the glasses with her hand becase she was overpooring and spilling on the outside of the glass. That is just gross.

Great environment, good wine selection, the butchers block is very tasty, and my all time fav here, the prosciutto bruschetta with figs & mascarpone. One of the best prosciutto bruschetta's i've ever had.

Love this place. One of the best Korean BBQ restaurants in the Phoenix area. They have excellent service and the private karaoke rooms are a blast, especially if you have a group. Just be aware of the soju, it'll creep up on you.

This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out. BIG mistake. I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had. The noodles weren't fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long. Extremely mushy and not edible. The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup. I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong. The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly. Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu.

Wow...I don't know how they are still in business. For the prices they charge, you would think the food would taste amazing. Explains why they had maybe 6 tables filled at 7pm on Mother's Day.   I placed an order for pick-up and ordered the Maine Lobster Cocktail, Broiled Sea Scallops wrapped in bacon, 6oz Filet, and Creme Brûlée. The Scallops were good, and the Creme Brûlée was decent. I've had much better Creme Brûlée though; this one was a little chunky and as far as presentation, they just threw it in the togo container making it look like a blob of mess. The Lobster Cocktail was not edible. It tasted and smelled like fish that had been sitting out for 10 days. They have better lobster at Red Lobster. Lastly, the filet... First of all, I ordered a medium rare steak and they gave me a medium well steak...didn't bother driving back to the restaurant to return in so I dealt with it. Setting that aside, the flavor of the steak and meat quality was subpar. If you put a Mastro's filet next to a Morton's filet, it would be like comparing a Ferrari to a Chrysler Minivan.   Don't waste your money here, go to Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Eddie V's, Bourbon Steak, The Capital Grille instead. You will get your money's worth and it will be less expensive!

Tried the plate. The rice is bland and oily, the Greek salad was ok, gyro meet was dry and beef meat was chewy, and calamari comes from a frozen package and was chewy and awful. Much better Greek places out there.

This place is a must go to chill and drink good wine. They usually have a live band and great ambiance. A really good wine selection and some tasty food. I like the 3 cheese fondue and street tacos. Their flatbreads are alright.

Cowboy Ciao is overall well rounded. Great interior design, fantastic service, and well cooked filet. It is also a good place to go just for dessert. The white chocolate blondie and  bread pudding are my favs.

This place has good breakfast with a great selection. Its nothing special or fancy, but the pancakes are awesome with one of the most diverse selections I've seen.   Don't like how they only accept cash and have a "no cell phone" policy. If I'm paying to eat somewhere, I don't want to be told I can't talk on my phone when I want to. I could understand if it was a high-end establishment...but they don't event accept debit cards here lol.

Recently purchased a Rolex here. The lady that helped was nice, helpful, and patient. She was knowledgeable as well. I'd recommend buying your Rolex here vs Hamra in North Scottsdale because Ben Bridge offers a 3 year warranty vs Hamra only offers the 2 year manufacturer's warranty. The only downside is their selection is a little smaller than Hamra's. Overall happy with the experience and was able to get the watch I wanted.   The only feedback I have to the people running this organization is if I'm spending 20K on a watch, don't do a budget cut on your shopping bags you give out to your customers. I'm walking out of the store, and I don't even make it to Macy's before the handle on the bag breaks and my brand new watch almost goes flying to the ground. Seriously, that is poor representation of an authorized Rolex dealer. Had to walk back to the store to get a new bag.

Great service, tasty steak. Highly recommend the filet or the filet with shrimp. The sides are huge portions, so keep that in mind when ordering. My dad ordered the lobster and it wasn't the best...but it is a steakhouse... There desserts are all amazing. I recommend the banana cream pie, creme brulee, or bread pudding.

Do not go to this LA Fitness, or any other for that matter. 24 Hour is much better. This LA Fitness over promises to get you to purchase memberships and training sessions. They hard close you and tell you things that aren't true to get you to purchase their membership. I was told that I didn't need a membership to have my personal training sessions, and then a couple weeks later after I signed agreement got a notice that this wasn't true. Had to call corporate to get this reversed. I cancelled my membership a couple months later because I moved and then got billed again the following month. Called this location to get the charge reversed and they hung up on me twice while transferring me to the GM and then said that the GM wasn't available. Very shady practices here.

This place is awesome! Great for groups, just make sure you don't have any underage people with you, they are sticklers about it. And if you do, they will stick you in the nosebleed section. They have a lot of top performers here and the drinks are nice and strong. The food selection is good too and pretty good quality. They do have Dom Pérignon at a decent price for those of you that want to go all out!

My friends and I went to Second Street Grill this past week and had a horrible experience. We originally chose this restaurant because of the positive reviews and it was also close to the show we were going to afterward.  We arrive at the restaurant with reservations and were immediately seated. Then we waited for 15 minutes for our server to come around...there were only about 4 other tables in the restaurant at the time. Finally our server, Gloria, comes over to our table. I asked her what the Gluten Free options were on the menu and she said we don't have anything that is Gluten Free. I was leaning toward the steak and lobster special so I asked her how that was prepared. She said there was butter, which wasn't gluten free, on the steak and lobster, and the sour cream on the baked potato wasn't gluten free either. Clearly she didn't know what Gluten was and was making stuff up as she went instead of asking the chef or someone that actually knew. Finally I said I'll take the steak and lobster and the butter was fine. Our table also asked for a side of bacon as well. The food comes out, I have a dry steak and a dry lobster...no butter on either. It was the worst steak and lobster I have ever had. The lobster tasted like it was a month old and the steak was the lowest quality steak for a $$$ rated restaurant i've ever had. 3 of us had ordered steak and not a single person had received a steak knife until we asked for one...half way through our meal because no one came by to check up on us and the bacon never came out. The server visited our table maybe 3 times during the entire dinner, once to take our order, once to give us water, and once to give us our checks.   There are many places to eat in Vegas, don't waste your money here. Not only is the service horrible, and maybe it was just Gloria, but the food is cheap and not on par with the prices.

This place is pretty darn good...if you want to wait an hour to be seated. Really tasty pizza, salad, etc, & staff if friendly. They don't have a nice area that you can wait at before you are seated and order drinks etc. Can't place orders to go or call ahead for seating.

If you are visiting Scottsdale and don't go to this mall, you are CRAZY. They have something for everyone here. It is the BEST mall in AZ by far. Plenty of high end stores and good food right around the mall. A must go for all tourists. Only downfall...no Apple store.

Overall I like this sushi place. It has more of the family feel when you go there rather than  lets drink a lot of alcohol and party vibe. It's not my top pick, but every time I have been here, the service has been great, staff super friendly, and sushi fresh. I would go back. The only unfortunate thing about this place...if you are looking for sushi on a Sat or Sun before 5, they aren't open...I've made this mistake before. Also, this place isn't really the spot to go to if you want a killer happy hour.

Finished my classes in about 3 weeks, took the tests, passed with flying colors. No complaint about the instructors or the classes. I felt well prepared for the school, State and National exam.  So why the one star? The school has "career partners" come in everyday and give their spiel on why you should join their company. Not complaining about this either, I think it is great service the school offers to students that don't know what company they want to work for when they finish. I however already had a job lined up, so the school gives you an option to opt out of getting contacted by the career partners because otherwise you will be getting phone calls etc from them. I opted out my first day of classes, then about 2 weeks into my classes, out of nowhere, I start getting floods of phone calls, text messages, and emails from different career partners. I immediately spoke to someone at the Peoria office and the lady there informed me that they had a new person working there and she made a mistake and it would be fixed. Not a problem, everyone makes mistakes...but a week later, I was still receiving texts, emails, phone calls from companies...4-6 a day. I called the same Peoria campus that I had spoke to the previous time and informed them of this. DIANA said there wasn't anything she could do as my information already went out. She suggested I block their phone calls. (brilliant diana, i'd love to unsubscribe to their emails as well but most of them don't have the option) I let her know this was a privacy issue and she said she would look into what they could do and would give me a call back later that day. No call later that day, the following day came and past and no communication from them. Clearly, they do not care about student's privacy and don't think it is a big deal to be swamped with phone calls, emails, and text messages from recruiters when you opted out.   So would I recommend this school, definitely not. Who knows what other type of private information they are giving out "accidentally" and not doing anything to remedy it.

Terrible bank. They closed the drive through service and permanently closed all but 3 of their service windows inside. Slow slow slow service. If you come in to see a banker, expect a 20 minute wait. Go somewhere else!!!! In fact there is a nice Wells Fargo right around the corner with much faster service.

Food is average but restaurant is horribly unorganized. Staff was rude, and it took 5 employees to find someone that spoke English to help me out. On top of that, they had flys swarming all over the place and in the kitchen too. They left food sitting out on top of that. Disgusting.

Not a fan of their burritos and prepared items. I usually just get sides here.  Their rice is really good and their tortillas are awesome. They are fresh baked and grande. Try out their butter tortilla. It is the best thing on their menu and worth it.

Sooo many better places to get sushi. Very limited selection. Tried to roles and sushi wasnt that great. Also tried a Japanese rice noodle dish with shrimp. It had a funky taste. On top of that we sat outside because of limited seating inside and we got several mosquito bites. Better Japanese restaurants out there.

Waited 20 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. The server finally came over after we asked 2 people for our server. After that she took our order on a newspaper that she grabbed off a stand because she didnt have her pad. She took out orders and the wrong food came out. Food was bland with little flavor. I do not recomment this place.

Let me start off by saying, this place is awesome!!!!  I had the filet medium rare and it was one of the best filets I've had. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes are a must. It was my favorite part of the meal. Huge chunks of lobster and creamy mashed potatoes. The creme corn was good as well, but I would go there just for the lobster mashed potatoes. If you don't try the lobster mashed potatoes, you are missing out on the entire experience of Mastro's.  As for dessert, the warm butter cake is amazing. I would recommend this or the creme brulee.   Warning, you will most likely feel like your stomach is about to explode when leaving there.  On a last note, get the lobster mashed potatoes.

Favorite sushi place in Scottsdale! Sushi is fresh, reasonably priced and service is great! Try the JPop and the Samurai Warrior. They have a really good happy hour, $1 Saki...can't beat that lol and they have happy hour on Sunday! The Saki infused drinks are tasty as well. The vegi wraps are pretty good too. Try the Karaoke there for groups!  They have heated toilet seats in the bathroom which is a plus! Be aware of the giant green rock in the middle of the restaurant if you've had too many saki...I don't know why it's there but can be hazardous haha.

Horrible service and horrible food. The seafood pasta was under cooked and had a very fishy taste. The chicken marsala tasted like chicken teriyaki from a cheap Chinese restaurant. Worst chicken marsala ever!!!! Do not eat here. Even their bread came out cold with their cold red sauce for dipping.

Love it! They have a great salad bar...but make sure not to eat too much here because the meat is the best part. The meat was endless. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet. Make sure to ask for it and regular filet because they dont come around as often with those 2 items. The bread balls are awesome and my favorite. Their flan and creme brulee are well made. The ambiance here is nice as well.

Confused by all the high reviews for their sushi. Usually yelp is right on. It is low-priced sushi without a doubt, so I wasn't expecting anything gourmet, but I gotta say...this sushi wasn't edible. The sushi you find in a Fry's grocery store or Whole Foods is better. I tried the Vegas Roll and their Alaskan Roll. The Alaskan roll was extremely fishy and couldn't eat more than one piece. The Vegas roll was funky. Can't quit put my finger on what it was...just didn't taste good...and definitely didn't taste like a Vegas Roll. Had a stomach ache after eating a couple pieces. Save your money and buy one roll at a better place. That one roll will fill you up more than two rolls that are inedible.   Can't comment about their chinese food because I've never tried it...hope its better.

One of the best frozen yogurt places! They always have a good selection of frozen yogurt and the flavors don't taste artificial like some of the places.

They also have a great selection of toppings!!!!

Went to this store several times to look at their Tag Heuer watches. The people here were very helpful, and did what they said when they said they were going to. Ended up getting the watch as a surprise gift so I didn't purchase from Ganem but would have otherwise. I went in with my Tag to get it sized and they did it for free, even though I didn't purchase from them. My next watch I am definitely going to get from them because of their stellar customer service. Would highly recommend this store.

You have to try their Fondue if you go here. Pretzels are fresh, soft, and the cheese is amazing. Their fried chicken tastes good, but is a huge portion. My favorite entree here is their rainbow trout. It is seasoned well and a huge portion. I am not a fan of a lot of their specialty drinks. I've had better mixed drinks elsewhere. Ambiance is nice, but can get very loud certain nights.

Out wedding cake came out looking amazing! I would highly recommend this place. We ordered our cake last minute, about a week before wedding during a busy wedding season...Valentines...and they had no problem accommodating us. I highly recommend the Almond cake flavor, it was my favorite. The strawberry came very close behind and was a favorite at the wedding. The white cake with chocolate chip something I wouldn't recommend at all. It is one of their recommended flavors. Very bland and flavorless compared to the other 2 flavors.

This comedy club is much smaller than Tempe Improv but is awesome in its own way. Reminds me of comedy clubs you'll find in Hollywood. Nice, cute, quant little places where you are so close to the comedian you can nearly touch him. Drinks were decent here and food was not bad either. I would definitely come back.

I like this BWW. I've had great service every time I have been here. The boneless wings are great and their selection of bear on tap is great. Come during happy hour and you can get a large beer for the price of a small. Yes, they might be more pricey than Wing Stop, but personally I think their wings are better, they have a better selection of sauces, and the ambiance is much better.

I was in Surprise and was starving so I decided to give this place a shot. The first thing I noticed was that the people working there weren't the friendliest. One instance was when I asked for ketchup with my to-go order came out. The lady snaps back at me that there was ketchup in my bag. I get to my car to find one measly ketchup container...who skimps on ketchup? The food was alright. I ordered the Mexican omelet which was pretty tasty, except that fact that one of the main ingredients was bacon, and I found 3 chuncks of bacon in the entire omlete! Seriously! Hash browns were mushy. Wouldnt come back because of unfriendly service and them being skimpy.

Taylor Shae Moran was our realtor and did an excellent job! She was on top of it from day one, was always in fast communication with us and kept us in the loop through every step of the process.   The first day we went looking at houses she had an efficient route for all the houses we wanted to see. We found a house the first day that we liked and was lucky Taylor was so fast to move because an offer came in on the house right after ours.   Taylor was very knowledgeable about the market and the inspection process as well.    We had the unfortunate experience of having to work with a mortgage broker by the name of Gilbert Castillo III with AmeriFirst Financial. He was in slow communication throughout most of the process with my husband and myself as well as with Taylor, but Taylor made sure to stay on top of him so that things wouldn't get even more dragged out than they were.  There is a reason why she is one of the top producing realtors in AZ...she has her act together! I would highly recommend her if you want an easy, smooth transaction.

Their meatball sub was average. Their cheese steak isnt bad, id eat that again at a different location. So why the low rating? Well, this place is filthy. They dont clean their tables. I saw a guy that worked their, walk around to push chairs in, but didnt clean anything off tables except for a napkin. Floors were just as dirty. On top of that, they have a blue light right above the coffee maker that has a lot of dead bugs on it.

They have awesome Pho Thai here at very reasonable prices. The thin slices of beef aren't fatty either! The staff is very friendly every time I come here as well. If you are in the mood for Pho Thai, I'd definitely recommend this place. One of the best I've found in the valley so far.

They have a great brunch. Highly recommend the eggs benedict and the sherbert mimosas. Their scallops are good for dinner. Service is friendly and fast!

Be aware of this dental office and Adam Schaefer. Him and his colleagues main focus is upselling you,from the moment you check in till you leave. I went in for my 6 month check where xrays aren't needed. Moment i check in they tell me i need xrays. I told them no, i already got xrays last time i was there. Then the lady says I'm there for a deep cleaning. I told her no, it is a regular cleaning. She looks at me and says...oh ok. Then after my cleaning the doctor comes in, looks at my mouth and says I have a cracked filling and a cavity under the filling. I said how would you know that, the xrays you took last time said I didn't have a cavity. Adam then said that since my filling is cracked I have a cavity there as well and need to get that fixed ASAP. Then his lady comes in with a quote that he can schedule a time to fix it for $600 out of my pocket with insurance. I said no way. I went to another dentist, had xrays done. No cavity, infact, no cracked filling. Abunch of bs from this office. If you want to overpay, and have procedure that are unnecessary, come here.

Do not use this dental office, unless you want to be overcharged. Their prices are higher than most dental offices in town. Not only are their prices higher...they give their patients skewed approximations of what insurance will cover and what the patient will have to pay. Also the office will try and upsell you left and right on many additional features that are unnecessary. They also try and spread out the visits to receive more payments from insurance companies as well. One day x-rays. Next week cleaning.   Despite the higher prices, I had a couple of cavities taken care of at this office because the staff seemed nice and professional, and two weeks after my cavities were fixed, I received a call from the office staff telling me I owed over $600 in additional to the $400+ I had already paid. Their estimate was approximately 70% off of what they had originally stated insurance would cover. What BS. I've heard of estimates being a little off, but not by over 70%.   If you are looking for a dentist, find another. There are many high quality dentists in Scottsdale. AVOID THIS OFFICE.
