I don't know why I keep ordering Chicken Egg Foo Yong from this place.  Perhaps because the lunch special price is cheap at $4.92.  However, there is so much sauce laden on the egg that you can't even taste it.  This is the 3rd time that I've had this dish and the 1st time was pretty decent, the last 2 times were terrible.  I don't know if they changed their cooks but if/when I come back, I will order something else.  The place gets packed at lunch so they have to be pretty decent.

The Capastrami was amazing.  I'm not a sub or sandwich person but I believe its the sub bread that made this so great.  It was fresh as if it just came out of the oven and light - not dense.  Flavors were terrific and the pastrami was wonderful.  This place is practically around the corner from my house and I'll come back for more.

I actually found tisplace by accident.  We tried to eat at a breakfast place near the same location but it was too full.  I had always heard that Busters had amazing food and indeed it was wonderful.  I had the Eggs Benedict and you actually get more food for the $ than some of my other favorite cafes in the same area.  We will definately be back - soon.

I've been a Ahwatukee local since 1999. CKs is a cool place to hear music.  I don't like the vodka they use as their house vodka,  it's always bitter.  So this is not my choice to go.  I had a coupon and went back on Good Friday for their all you can eat Fish Fry.  The breading had no flavor what so ever.  I gave 2 stars because the service is always good, I wish the owners/managers would taste the dishes that their cooks put out,  and add some creative flavor to their fish fry.

This place was referred by friends who are foodies so we decided to give it a try.  I'm very particular about  my eggs benedict but never  expectsd my breakfast to be cold. The waiter was great and replaced my breakfast.  It was steaming hot on top,  but underneath the 2nd egg,  my food was cold.  Needless to say I may give this place a 2nd chance but will not order the eggs benedict.

I had to add a review after reading that Portillo's uses frozen crinkle french fries.  Jimmys uses a whole potato and slices it right in front of you - nothing frozen.  Jimmys is great.

Always wonderful.  Not only does Betty and her staff make my dogs feel so welcome, but she is always so nice and sweet when I come in to drop off and pick up.  I have been coming for several years and always refer her to other people with pets.

This place is absolutely perfect.  I never give 5 stars yet this place is worth it. My 1st visit this morning and I had the basil chicken crepe and shared the lemon drop sweet crepe as a dessert.  Presentation was beautifully plated,  the flavors very distinctive.  I can't wait to come back

Just found this little gem via my cousin who urged me to Like on Facebook.  I received a FB notice that the truck would be in Tempe today so I drove over.  The food is good, I had the steak satay meal.  I think that the price is a little high $8.50 for only 2 skewers but maybe because the satay was so good I would have liked 3 skewers for the price.  I hope that Satay Hut eventually has a restaurant because I would definately travel outside the East Valley to eat there.

When this restaurant was Taylor's, I considered it the BEST Eggs Benedict in the area.  Once they changed to Daily Bistro I thought I would try it again.  The view is fantastic but the food is lacking.  The orange juice tastes like it came from a carton where before it was pulpy and tasted fresh squeezed.  The Eggs Benedict now only comes on Canadian Bacon where previousy the Black Forest Ham made the dish stand out.  I spoke to the manager and she said I could request that in the future - so i will try it again.  The spinach lettuce which originally was used as a garnishment on the plate was now placed "within" the eggs benedict, which made me have to remove it and lose some of the hollandise sauce.  Not a a good first impression for Daily Bistro.  But yet the view is fantastic and with some requests when I place my order, I hope to redo my review and give it  3-4 stars.

This place is awesome.  A upbeat cool atmosphere with boho chic furnishings outside.  The menu is small but with enough to lure the varietal tastes of my party of 4. I had the roasted salmon and the compliment of quinoa, apples and jicama made this dish simply awesome.  Culinary Dropouts is my new favorite place.

It's something about the crust. I'm addicted.  Plus the service was great and the food came out rather quickly for a Saturday night.  I even ordered dessert and told the waitress that I knew the meaning behind the menu titles.  She smiled and winked at me.

Zipps -I am so glad that you are a neighborhood bar and grill.  But do us all a favor and don't forget to add some flavor.

After reading previous reviews we almost didn't dine here.  I am so glad we did.  Our server was Shana and she is awesome.  The Road Kill was delicious as was my rib eye steak.  The baked potato was the best I ever had.  The music wasn't too loud,  and the place had a nice cowboy vibe.  We will be back.
