I always want to like Panda Express. They're friendly, nice establishment, conveniently located- but the food always leaves me disappointed

Wow, what a find! Great salsa, darn good house margarita, and the Pollo Pasado was wonderful! Great place for lunch as the service was prompt and the food came out super fast! The owner Oscar came to our table and shared various salsa's with us you can tell his restaurant is his passion. I was impressed by the quality of the food. After reading other reviews I was expecting something a little more bland and less thrilling, but honestly the flavors and quality was great. My new favorite find in Gilbert. Don't hesitate to give it a try!

My favorite restaurant. Great food and always great drink specials. The ambiance is very cool, its a place you'll want to bring your friends and enjoy an evening. The staff is usually very friendly but they disappear often and its hard to get great service.

Foods great and the portions are huge! Lunch prices aren't bad- especially since you can split almost anything on the menu with someone and still leave stuffed!

My friend's love meeting here for dinner all the time. I don't know why. The restaurant is a cheesy Italian atmosphere trying hard to be a fancy establishment and honestly its a little dirty. The food is eh and expensive. Every pasta dish I get tastes the same- mushy and greasy, but the pizza really is very good. If you must go- ask for Justin he is the greatest server and I'm always happy when he serves us- so adorable and prompt!

Fun atmosphere, good sushi, creative rolls. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. Always have a great time & enjoy the food, but it's always cost me. The bill ads up quickly!

Fun little place with good tacos. Love to sit on the patio with a cervesa and a couple carbon tacos. Fresh and tasty!

This is the best coffee place in Gilbert, hands down. The staff is awesome and friendly.They roast their own coffee beans- how cool is that? The best part though is the beautiful garden/patio area. With free wi-fi it's the perfect oasis to waste away a little time or meet up with a friend!

Just tried this place for the first time with friends the other night. Lovely atmosphere although its mostly outdoor seating. Had the Ahi Caeser salad which was heavenly. Good drinks as well! A little pricey but a good time none-the-less!

My dogs Peewee, Molly, and Frankie spend about 3-4 days per week at Gilbert Dogs. It makes me feel good knowing they're in a safe and stimulating environment instead of at home alone. The staff at Gilbert Dogs is wonderful. Tina and Erin are my favorites! At first I though dog daycare was a luxury, now I don't know how I ever lived without it! Thank you to Stephen and your staff for the great care you've given to my dogs!

I love this place. As a small business owner I love holding meetings because of the beautiful environment and free Wi-Fi. As a consumer I love the various smoothies and the passion fruit tea. Marc & Jodie are not just good owners, they're gracious hosts- always accommodating me for larger business gatherings.

My company has sent a few projects over to the people at Laser Creations, and it's been a great experience each time. They are very helpful, amazing to work with, and their pricing is competitive.  We have found them to be very dependable, professional, and reliable. A great business to work with. I will likely change this review to 5 stars once I have worked more with them.

Heather's wonderful. She designed my mother's yard and maintains it. What a difference! We invited her to create a landscape design of our front and backyard. She was thoughtful and listened to all our ideas and concerns and came back with a beautiful and budget friendly design. She is a wealth of botanical information. We are so excited to get started in the spring with her. If it goes as well as we anticipate then I'll probably be back to offer 5 stars!

Awesome awesome awesome. The food is great, the lunch specials are a steal, and they really treat you right. Each time I've been I've been so impressed with the staff. Even had the chef come to our table once because the person I was with made up her own custom dish and the chef wanted to see how it turned out- it was perfect. Totally recommend!
