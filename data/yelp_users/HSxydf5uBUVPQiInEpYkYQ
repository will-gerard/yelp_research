There's really no way to describe the place without experiencing it. It's definitely one of the coolest clubs I've ever been to. The drinks are definitely pricey, but the eye candy, mouth candy, or whatever floats your boat makes it worthwhile. They really should change the name of this place to PURE DEBAUCHERY. Thanks to Harrahs MBA poker tournament, we got to go in early, and they had an open bar for 2 hours.  Of course, when you ask for water, you will get a 9 dollar plutonium container, called Voss. So I had 9 bottles of water along with all my drinks.  Pretty much every time you walk to the bar, you will be out 20 bucks. That said, the views of the strip are amazing and it remains one of favorite places in Vegas..

I guess I should really base my reviews on something other than the talent in the place, but that'll never happen. Supposedly everybody looks the same after a few drinks. But, after sighting Ron Jeremy here during th porn convention, I would have to say he is the ugliest MF I've ever seen. Anyways, as far as the club goes, it is a new Vegas hotspot, with high priced drinks, and hot girls surrounding the bar. Aside from the 3 hour waits that sometimes come with going to Tao, I would recommend it with anybody. Also, having some females with you helps alot in terms of getting you in.

This was by far my favorite clubbing experience in Vegas. It doesnt' have the hype that Pure has, and without the hype you don't get the attitude from the crowd. I think this place is actually underrated and can be alot of fun. The fact that they have bars outdoors makes it easy to get your drinks  quickly. The barenders are friendly, and usually on a Friday nite in Vegas, you're bound to have a good time.

You want to go to Vegas and break your bank? This is a perfect place to do it. But, somehow I was stunned that my bar tab that was below 100 dollars. I was so shocked I felt like ordering 6 more drinks just because I was shocked. A friend managed to get us in without waiting in line at all. The joy of having friends who grew up in Vegas!!!

This is the most overrated clubbing experience in Vegas. Maybe it was good when it first opened, but it totally sucks. If you want to not get in or wait 2 hours when you are first in line, and be surrounded by 4000 people wiht no place at all to sit down then I suggest it.  This placeis all hype. It's full of people who want to just show off, and with nothing reallyto show off.

If you visit the Sandbar and you are not a Scottsdale local you will be convinced that breast implants are a requirement for working there. Every bartender/waitress seemed to have implants. To add to that, across me ther was a young girl having the following conversation with some cougar:   Young Girl: Yeah, my doctor was awesome. Cougar: Oh yeah? Young girl: yeah, he made them completely natural Cougar: oh..... Young Girl: You should totally get some... Cougar: yeah, I've thought about... Young Girl: here, let me give you his card  So in other words... if you like breast implants visit the Sandbar. As far as the food...who knows, who cares?
