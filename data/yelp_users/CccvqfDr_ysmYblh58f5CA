Was a big fan of fiasta burrito but when my sister and her gf (she happens to be African American) went in to get something to eat you can tell they felt uncomfortable and made us feel uneasy. They just kept giving altitude and rolling there eyes. At one point we can hear them comment in the back saying racial slurs in spanish since were mexican also. I just cant go back if they are prejudice and homophopic and if thats how they run business then we're jusy going to take our business else where.  Update-went again to get something to drink since it was hot and too see if they changed but guess not So I talked about fiasta burrito before but damn man dont go at night for drinks. Just went to get a small horchata and a large and the guy end up giving me 2 large which isn't a big deal but then before I took off I noticed one was purple so I went back literally seconds later pretty much went around the restaurant still in there parking lot and the guy was like "what do you want"(really man) and I said "hey man I asked for 2 horchatas and he went on the offense and said "NO YOU SAID 1 HORCHATA AND 1 JAMAICA LOOK AT YOUR RECEIPT". then I went um no 1st I asked for 1 large and 1 small and you end giving me two large with no receipt which I dont mind but you didn't give two horchatas and then he went on by okay but I need to charge you and I said wth why i didn't ask for that order then he was like fine pull up and he end giving me my drink but with the craziest altitude. I was more shocked then mad like wtf man it was the easiest order ever and I didn't snap at him or get mad. Idk why he was so mad

There the most friendliest and most helpful bike shop. They have accessories most bike shop dont have. They have chrome bags! Bikes are pricey but there high quality. The guy who runs the register is the nicest. The older lady is nice too. They will recognize if you go back. I really recommend them for accessories and for cheapest fixies.

Geisha is our spot. Cheap house sushi, drinks and apps everyday thru 3-7 and all day Sunday. If you dont get there early you will wait for 20 min to 45 for a table. Every one is nice even the security gaurds. Sometimes gets Really Noisy due to there dj but its Whatever tho. Great for groups and to bring your friends who haven't had sushi before.

Pizza, hot wings and greek fries are really good but when I tried there sandwiches 3 of my friends and I had to use the restroom 30 min later.I like to sit in and there 1 and only table and chairs are unbalanced hard and cold. the worst is when you go when the AA meetings are taking place next door and your eating and the people are freaking smoking. the 2nd hand smoke really makes you lose your appetite and make you sick. I would love to go when I want but seems like you have to drive by it to see if its okay to eat there. If it wasn't for the AA meetings and raggidy chairs and table it would be perfect but until then cant give it good props.

They gave me a packet of coupons to eat for free for a "year" pretty much a burger for a week. Place is open 24 hrs and so is the inside. The employees are nice and friendly. The only complain I have is they take forever in the drive thru but other then that its cool to sit and eat.
