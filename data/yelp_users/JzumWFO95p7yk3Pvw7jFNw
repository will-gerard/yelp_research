Omg!  I'm so upset that so how rude I was beening treated, I went in there for shoes & clothes.  I found one that I liked so I was holding one shoe and asked the lady ( well first, she was ignoring me when I went up to her she pretended that she was doing something when matter affect she look dumb running left to right behide the cash register :) ) when I finally get her attention and asked to try to shoe in my size, you told that the one I'm holding in my hand IS my size.   UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I was so pissed off I drop the shoe and walk out..   I'm so sad because I love their stuff.  :(

Went there to exchange/return a bag that we got for Christmas.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Too bad we didn't see anything we liked, so they offered to give us merchant credit that we can use online or use it next time or if we see something online since we didn't see anything we like this time, that we don't have worry carrying the bag that we want to return back and forth.  Very nice, now that is customer service.

This Starbucks is okay.  I only come here because its the only one on my way to work.  Their staff can be rude and unfriendly, they make you feel like you're not as important as the other customers are their friends are they know.  I think I'm going to have to find another Starbucks even if that means I have to go out of my way....  ::(

I love their food but DO NOT come to the Scottsdale location.  I phoned in my order ahead to beat the lunch rush, I get there not busy i though cool.  I walk up to the counter, a girl comes up to counter looks at me don't say anything to me so I was like I'm here for an pick up order, she said "um hum" and tell me my total, turn around grabs my togo order.  I paid her, she gaves me my changes tells me there is fork over there, turns around and go into the kitchen..... Not a "How are You" not a "thank you" Not "have a nice day"  NOTHING.....  RUDE.    On top of that my meat was soo dry.  Never, never would I go back to this place again....  BAD Service,  BAD FOOD!!

They change the place and the menu, we order our usual.  The price is about the same and the portion was smaller, the staff was not friendly.  I will not come back to this place.  My kids and I miss the OLD Pei Wei!!!  Why fix it if it is not broken!!!  WHY????

I like their pizza but they need to improve on their wings and maybe the cashier need to be little nicer...  I like the other locations better than the west side location.

Worst customer service ever!  Trying to redeem the check in deal was told that the special is expired and it's no good, when I just ordered $40 worth of food Togo.  The cashier was rude so was the manager..  Never coming back.

Great food and great service.  We had their lemongrass soup, fish cake, BBQ chicken, pai Thai,  pineapple fried rice and curry beef.  All was so great, hot and tasty.  I will def go back again.

Heard of "Don't judge a book by its cover", well if you saw the outside or where this restaurant is located you'll think to yourself this place can't have good food but let me tell everything on their menu is like homemade at least I believe they are...  :). Our family favorite is their green chilie burrito, it's so spicy that you mouth will burn but at the same time you don't want to stop eatting it because it is sooooo good.  It's addicting.  Must try!!!

Its your typical Chinese buffet, nothing to rave about.  Not a big fan, the food was ok.  But our table was sticky and dirty.  That would be one reason that I will not go back, the place is dirty not clean, floor is dirty.

Came here for the Magic Mike's Ladie's night Yelp event.  What an awesome place to come watch a movie, friendly staff, and clean.  Very hip, definitely different way to a boring movie night.  It is a great place for an date, family or just having a girls night out.  Love it!!  I will definitely have to bring my family here to watch a movie or come back here for an movie date night with my husband.  They offer variety of selection on their menu, from Chicken tenders, pizza, salad...etc  Price is decent, we had their chicken tenders, burger bites, and buffalo chicken bites;  I had an Ice tea and my friend had a beer, our bill was under $30, plus watched an awesome movie and had a great girls time.  Can't beat that.

After a friend of mine went there that morning and said it was good, I had to go try it for myself.  All four of us had different flavors and toppings, we were all very impress with it.  The place is hip and the servers very friendly.  I'm ready to go back for more, wish they were closer to where I live.   Def will be going back soon.
