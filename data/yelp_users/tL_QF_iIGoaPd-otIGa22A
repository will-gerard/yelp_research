I LOVE Athenian Express!  My mom works downtown, and whenever I have a chance I go to meet her for lunch, it is definately my #1 pick!  She gets the steak or chicken picado and I always get the veggi pita.  I crave this place.  I wish there were more locations!

I was kind of turned off when I pulled into the parking lot, but I decided to try this place after researching and it got amazing reviews on Yelp and other websites.  Although the outside is a little unappealing, the food was so so so good!  The salsa was very spicy, and tastey!  I would definately go back for some good Mexican seafood!

I can't even begin to to explain how good the food is here! We came a few weeks ago, and my boyfriend wouldn't stop asking when we were coming back. The food is HOT, so be prepared! At the beginning, you get chips with a side of beans, spicy sour cream, red salsa, and green chile salsa... so good! My boyfriend got the Green Chile Plate and it looked and smelled so good. I got the vegetarian plate that comes with a bean taco(totally vegetarian), a cheese enchilada, chile rellano, and rice and beans. You will ALWAYS take food home for leftovers. The service is friendly, they bring your food out on carts, which is kind of weird, but who cares.   I would definitely recommend this place if you like spicy (New) Mexican food!

I really love this office!  I moved to Mesa about a year ago, but I make my way out to Goodyear because they are so great!  Frida, at the front desk, is soooo nice.

Tried this place on my lunch break one day and didn't know what to expect. Walked in, not much to see. I got the vegetarian sandwich, and it was so good! I will definitely be back.

I LOVE this place!!!  I've never been for anything but breakfast, but I have never been disappointed!  There will almost always be a wait on Saturday and Sunday morning, but it is so so so well worth it.  The food is good, service is friendly, and portions are HUGE.

No matter where I go, this is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant. I love the decor. I have never had a bad experience here.

Oh The Pasty, how I love thee, let me count the ways!  I have never, not once been disappointed.  If you've never had a pasty, I would tell you that you need to go.  I really like the atmosphere, the church pews as seats and the alcohol bottles as candle holders are awesome.  I would say that the staff seem like hipsters, but they're all really friendly and helpful.  They have pretty good drink specials, and their hibiscus tea is mighty tastey!  PS.  Their vegetarian menu is LONG, and like I said, it's all good!  I think my favorites are The Greek and the Eggplant Parm.

I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful.

I moved away from the west valley about a year ago.  So last I knew, this place was McGrath's.  My grandma had mentioned that she went there with some friends, and thought the food was good, and had her next 2 meals taken care of with left-overs!  Needless to say, I was majorly disappointed.  The menu was very cheap looking and absolutely tiny.  Maybe 4 salads, and 5 entrees?  I got the vegetarian entree which wasn't bad, but over priced, just like the rest of the menu.  I checked in on Yelp and got a free dessert, which is my FIRST check in offer!  So I asked the waitress, I don't think she knew what I meant when I told her, I offered to show, but she just walked away and came back with the dessert menu.  We did get to choose whatever dessert we wanted.  We got the hazelnut espresso cheesecake, it was very good, but tiny.  I would have been upset if we paid for it.  The service was decent, but it was about 3 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon.  The waitress was nice, and being in the service industry, I know people depend on tips, but you're not supposed to make it so obvious about it.

I was here one time before I bought a Groupon for this place. The Italian Herb bread is so good. I always get the vegetarian sandwich, so I'm not sure, or care, about the meat portions. Every time I go, there is friendly service and the food is good. They have a great lunch deal too!

Firstly I will say that I never received any services from this place. I got a Groupon for a facial I needed to use before it expired. I went on their website to check when they were open, what kind of facial I wanted, and hoping to make an appointment for Friday. The website clearly states, "Friday 10:16 - 5. WALK IN ONLY - NO APPOINTMENTS TAKEN". I left work 4 hours early to try and make it to the school before they closed. I made it, and walked in through doors that also stated they closed at 5pm. I asked the girl if they stopped taking people at 5 or they needed to be finished by 5. She stated they were closed, and closed at 4pm. When I asked about the door and the website, the girl told me they were wrong. Yes, it was my fault waiting until the last hour of the last day to use my Groupon. Did this business act unprofessional? The girl was nice, but it is very unprofessional to have conflicting information on your website (and the front door of your business). Needless to say, I will not be back to use the cash value.
