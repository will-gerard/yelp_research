I love this place. Great food and great service every time I come. Drinks keep coming when they become empty and I love the 3 salsa they serve right when you sit down.  I love the chicken zuchinni it's a personal fav and the rice and steamed veggies are delicious as a side. Veggies aren't over cooked and they aren't smothered in grease.

We started with the bacon wrapped shrimp. Can't go wrong with that and the sauce was perfectly paired with it. Most amazing and delicious filet!! Tender, moist and the flavor was perfect. The au gratin potatoes were creamy and filled with cheese and onions. The asparagus cooked to perfection and not smothered in butter which is preferred. Mushrooms were seasoned to perfection and not overly greasy either. Nothing like a perfect dinner while watching the fountains outside. The service was excellent and they were readily available without being annoying.

The area is perfect as in plenty of shops restaurants and grocery stores nearby and the amenities are decent for the price. The pool is shared with the adjoining courtyard and it isn't the biggest or smallest of pools. Decent for one hotel but kind of small for 2. Decent gym with a couple cardio machine and free weights. Large spacious rooms and a decent breakfast. Only reason it got a 4 vs a 5. Poor customer service.

OMG!!! Talk about awesome and great food in an airport!! Loved the French Toast, thick peppered bacon and sausage and the syrup was AWESOME!! I don't usually rave about syrup but I found myself dipping every thing in it. My server was Mauren and she couldn't have been friendlier or quicker. Only thing I wish was they served my Diet Coke. But after that meal I can't complain.

Very disappointed the second time around. Service was awful as in she took my order delivered it and never once came back to see how it turned out. When I was leaving I told her how awful it tasted she said sorry have a great day. My french toast was so undercooked and burnt on the outside I couldn't even finish it.
