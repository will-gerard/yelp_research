Weird...  I expected this to be a Japanese restaurant and had been wanting to try it. I've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles. So I walked in and BAM! Italian decor? WTH was going on.  This restaurant has zero sense of identity, but decent food.  They don't really know what a vegetarian is, in spite of actually having some decent adaptable vegetarian entrees. We asked our waitress and she said, "WELL WE HAVE SALADS!" -_-   They need to educate the staff on the menu for situations like these, whether the person is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. So, I managed to work with Miss Clueless, and customized the pad thai - it was delicious!   Honestly, I probably won't be going back. I could definitely find better Thai dishes, and can buy many of the noodles myself. It wasn't bad, just wasn't special.

I didn't hate it, it was okay. If you have a lot of time to piss away, go ahead and check this out. The service is super slow. There was no one to greet my fiancé and myself when we walked in.  When someone did come out about 5 minutes later, she greeted the first party and invited them to sit where they liked, so we followed suit. Then she brought out water about 10-15 minutes or so later. The water was refreshing! They have freshly sliced oranges in it!  Then about 10 minutes after that we ordered. If you're keeping track, we has been here about 25-30 mins at this point. We shared the dumplings, I had the sweet and sour divine, and he had the Garlic sensation.  The lentil soup they serve with the meal was yummy! And the dumplings can satisfy in insatiable appetite for all things dumpling. I have an unhealthy obsession with dumplings. Mmm, dumpling.   They serve Stash jasmine green tea, which I loved. The soy chicken could be tastier but the dish was pretty good, nonetheless. I could make a tastier meat sub, myself  And holy hell, they do not know what a sense of urgency is! We had to leave and said, "we're running late, can you go ahead and run our bill?" Note, we has already finished eating and had not even been visited for a check. She went off, did a couple of other things, adjusted a menu on her way to the register, and finally checked us out.   If you go, do not expect great service. Expect alright food, aloofness, and a strange ambiance.

LOVE! This place is cheap and they have a gorgeous color selection of all my favorite nail polish brands. I was meeting a friend here, and happen to live in CenPho. But I will happily go out of my way again.   The nail techs are friendly, speak clear English, and are very meticulous, even using a brush with acetone to clean up when they're done with the polish.   I got a mani and pedi with a hot rock massage. DEFINITELY do that.

I am a big sandwich fan!!! These are delish! The sesame bread is the best. It has a light crust with the perfect give and soft interior. Parking is horrible, but it's worth it to find someplace to park. My fiancé LOVED the roast beef, and he is not a sandwich person.  The decor is cute, and the service is super friendly. If you love sandwiches, try it. It's better than any chain I have tasted.

Came her on a date night that included a nauseous tummy... and I left with a satisfied belly and resolution to return!  We ate family-style, and I had the privilege to enjoy the Tom Ka Gai, Green Papaya Salad, and Chicken Panang.   The waitress was accommodating, funny, and seemingly sincere with her candor. Once the Tom Ka Gai came out, and the delicious broth filled my mouth, I am pretty sure my body went into some kind of shock - there was nothing else going on in the world, except the flavor explosion in my mouth!   It was spicy, yet creamy, and FLAVORFUL! I still frequently fantasize about this soup. The chicken wasn't sparse, and I am actually drooling, just thinking about it.  The Panang and Green Papaya were equally delicious. Not to the Tom Ka Gai (the obsession is truly an unhealthy one), but to each other. It depends on what you're in the mood for... But the Panang sauce combined with chicken and rice made for a delicious meal, and even a not-so-guilt-free breakfast the next day. The Green Papaya Salad was served with grilled chicken and sticky rice. The cool salad was crispy and combined well with the chargrilled chicken.  I can't wait to try more, and hope you enjoy it, if you try (Tom Ka Gai) anything on the menu! I am positive you'll find anything there enjoyable. There is a wide variety of Pan Asian cuisine to delight your tastebuds.

If you have the time, you can have a truly gourmet meal at a deep discount.   You must realize first that you are working with students. Everyone from service staff, to the cooks are learning. They provide excellent, friendly service. It may be a bit slow - but again - they are learning!  They proved knowledgeable about the menu, and are able to remark about which items are allergy friendly. Items can also be tailored to the customer. I have a gluten allergy, and while they gave me options, I chose two dishes that were already naturally gluten-free. I had the caesar salad and the red fish poele.   The salad was crisp and fresh, but didn't have as much cheese as I would have liked. Nor did it have the tang I am accustomed to with greek salads. It was tasty, however!  The red fish did not disappoint. It was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin, albeit questionably presented. The corn ragout and choron sauce complimented it perfectly!   The desserts had the most impressive presentation. I couldn't have most of them, but I had the pot de creme that accompanied a donut dish. And I must say -- the pot de creme was out of this world delicious!   They are educated about wine, as well. So bring your refined palate and ask about which wine pairs well with your choice of entreé! There is an excellent pairing ready for every palate.  Come out to Arizona Culinary Institute and give these students a chance. They are happy to work with you. Note that it is reservation only, so call ahead. Especially make sure to call ahead if you have food allergies! They are all very accommodating and you will definitely enjoy your experience.

I know little about Ethiopian food. I'm an adventurous eater, and was taken here to try it. And I must say, now, that I am a fan!   The food was very cheap, and incredibly flavorful. So, if you're on a budget, and want to either impress a date with your culture, or are a foodie, this is a great place to try! I am writing it only as 4 stars only because I haven't tried any other Ethiopian food. However, I pretty much don't want to risk tr.ying another place ;)  The Ethiopian tea they serve is fantastic, along with your meal. The portions are generous, along with generous amount of of injera. We has more than enough food around us, and left stuffed.  The dish that especially impressed me, was the curry chicken. So much so, that I continually kept enjoying the injera in the sauce.   All the vegetarian food was delicious! I, unfortunately, don't remember the names of everything, but the greens were some of the best I've ever had, along with a lentil dish.   Also, I rated this good for kids, however, that's only because I have a toddler that eats anything! If you don't have problems feeding your kid unique food, I suggest an attempt!  In short, if you're a big food fan, or want to be a little more adventurous on your food options, especially for a great, fair price, try Blue Nile!!

I really love the food here. Just have to say. The fish tacos are the best in town, and the beans are yummy.   Happy hour special - beware - they are only available at the bar. But the margaritas are top notch and the food is worth it.

I love PF Changs. Well, let me rephrase that: I love PF Changs vegetarian options. When I ate meat, I wasn't the biggest fan of their food. But they have some delectable Ma Po Tofu and vegetable side dishes that tickle my fancy.  However, while eating meat, I went there and was sorely disappointed. For vegetarians, however I highly recommend the joint! For meat-eaters, meh. There is much better pan Asian cuisine.  Our waitress was funny and very attentive. We came here on a date and she recommended some amazing cocktails. The Coconut Lemon Sour was amazing. Not cloyingly sweet and hit the spot. I rarely crave cocktails, but this one is definitely craveable.  Rarely does a restaurant make yummy tofu, but they do here. In fact, I never order it at restaurants because 98% of them have boring, flavorless tofu. That is probably why people hate it. At PF Changs, you won't.

Roosevelt was fantastic! I'd definitely return. However, mostly for beer, it's not my top choice. To be honest, I'm limited because I only dined upon their cheese plate, and guzzled a single pint of brew, and I agree with others, it is delightful.  I don't see myself enjoying it, if it was a full house. Seating is limited, and it's seemingly overwhelming when it's busy.   However, the atmosphere is right up my ally. It's a converted Historic home - beautiful! We went on a rainy Sunday. It was dead, and I got to enjoy my present company as I delighted on the flavors of one of my favorite meals: one that combines cheese, fruit, bread, and at The Roosevelt: Valrhona chocolate.   Now, they serve kind of a "bread of the moment" which was a currant bread which was good, but not what i expected when another bread they had served was hyped up to me. I do enjoy the fact that they have a variety of local brews, and I'm always up for a new beer.  All in all, it's good. But also kind of hard to screw up a cheese plate.

This is probably my new favorite spot, as I just moved into the neighborhood.   I've been here twice. Once for drinks on a date, and once for brunch. Each time the service was stellar. They have an accommodating, kind, and thoughtful staff!  The drinks... Oh, the drinks. I'm not usually a cocktail person, but I ordered the Strawberry Basil Caiparinha and the Cucumber Cooler. They're made with actual fruit and were a delight. Not terribly sweet, so perfect for my taste buds. But the crowning glory was the cucumber cooler. Hendrick's Gin, Lemonade... To. Die. For. I HIGHLY recommend this cocktail!  For a date night, it was perfect, and relatively dead late at night. The ambiance of the patio was wonderful for the feel of the evening, and was a perfect treat to round out my night.  And for brunch? My tongue was titillated with the delight of an appetizer of a baguette with pear-ginger jam & butter, the "Smoked Salmon" and a mimosa.   The smoked salmon was served like a Benedict, hollandaise and all, along with fried fingerling potatoes that still make me drool, even still! I dipped the 'taters into remaining hollandaise and ate until I couldn't anymore! It was simply too good, and I would love to enjoy it again - I can't wait to!  I was also impressed with them locally-sourcing goods, such as their tea from Maya in Tucson. It was high-quality, and tasty. I'm a total beverage snob, so I appreciate quality coffee and tea!  If you like fine tasting food and beverage, this place is great. Brunch also features a jazz group playing, that fits perfectly with the atmosphere provided. I highly recommend this for a date, or a special treat!

I've been coming here for 12 years.   The P.A.'s are fantastic. I will often see Julie and she will order enough tests to get the job done. Others may order every test imaginable.   Dr. Curtis Page (son) and Dr. Robert Page (father) are the two doctors in the office. They are all competent and capable of diagnosing. I personally have never seen Robert Page, but Curtis Page is quick and intuitive when treating his patients.   I have come to trust completely that they pick the best possible P.A.'s to treat their patients. It may be difficult to pin down The Doctors, but the P.A.'s are there to fill the space for a huge amount of patients, and when extreme diagnoses are not required.   The other review on here seems to not trust P.A.s, but I ensure you they are competent and will refer you to the doctor if something is beyond their scope of treatment. They are not pill pushers, and when they do provide a drug it has always been something perfect for my needs.  Sometimes they may take awhile, but they take their time with each patient. I would rather wait a little longer to see them, than be pushed out the door with a drug in hand. They used to guarantee fast service, but no longer do. They simply guarantee great healthcare.

Love this place. Overpriced, because I can have a strong Vietnamese woman do the same thing for about $30... But they are all very personable!  I went here because I got a gift card. I will say that you should not get water there. I have been to much cheaper salons that give me a little bottle of water. Not this one. You get a glass with ice cubes they made themselves! I like lemon in my water, but this tasted rancid for some reason and made me nauseous. No water for me.  The massage was nothing special. It was really no more than lotion that allegedly had diamonds in it being rubbed into my skin. I thought I paid for a 15 minute massage on my hands/feet each, but apparently not.

Service was very indifferent. I was able to see other waiters and waitresses that were more exuberant, but not ours. Then the manager asked the loaded question, "is everything wonderful???" strategic. Very. But everything was okay at best. I didn't feel like explaining how the bacon was overcooked in my dish, and my eggs were indeed NOT Over Easy. I should have said something.  I imagine the original location is better. I'd give it a shot.

Cheap, extensive variety in produce! This is bigger and better than Ranch 99 as it even has imports from Latin America and other Asian countries!   We bought a bunch of new stuff to try, as I sipped some yummy boba tea! We're going to come here more often as it is a boon for vegetarians with delicious fake meats, and fresh tofu!

Love the food... Love it. When you can walk-in to a restaurant and feel cleaner walking out, they've done a good job. I had the carrot-coconut soup, golden hummus, and I had pesto foccacia with nut cheese, and a gorgeous salad with yellow bell peppers, mint, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, and spring mix. This was fresh and wonderful.  The raw vegan shooters were tasty! Try them. I forgot which one my fiancé got, but I stole a sip and it was lovely. They sub in nut cheese for any dairy cheese, and serve teas and a lot of raw foods. My fiancé got the raw zucchini alfredo that was amazing (you know I stole some!!).  Then we went to the market that it's adjoined with... For items you can buy at Whole Foods and Sprouts, they GOUGE. 2 ounces of goji berries for $14!? I can get them at a health food store for $20 for a POUND, 8 times that!  Go there for the food, specialty teas, and maybe some tinctures. But don't get your normal stuff there.

Good, not great coffee. They have some AMAZING food, that you wouldn't expect. They have the best veggie sandwich in town, incredible salads, and some wonderful baked goods.   When I wasn't vegan, I definitely loved the waffles. TRY them. Spoil yourself a little.

I don't think there is a single thing I indulged in here that wasn't insanely delicious.  I had been eying it since I dined at The Turf next door. It's right up my ally!   The most remarkable items to me were the soup dumplings and this spicy shrimp dish! Oh, and the red curry wings.   It's simply too drool worthy to get over, at least for me. A lot of the meals are spicy, so if you can't take heat, be careful with what you select! I haven't had their lunch menu yet,. but I hear it's all spicy!  Anticipate small plates for dinner - tapas. I like to share with someone. The atmosphere is a great place for a date, and the DJ they have in the evenings isn't too loud or intrusive upon your dining experience. The service is great - you don't have to worry about ever flagging down your waiter.   It's a small, cozy restaurant that is great for events where you desire good conversation over good food! I'd go again, and a million more times, if i could.

Very good for any special diets! If you're vegan and gluten-free, you're out of luck on the pizzas. But have no fear! There are options for everyone - even those "Regular" people!  The gluten-free crust is not vegan (egg) but I am only vegetarian for the moment. It was better than I thought a gf crust would be. The candied walnuts were shockingly good on pizza and I highly recommend trying it with any combination!  I will be going again... and maybe again! and again!

You know, I normally love this place if I get the right food. I am picky, though. It is very hit or miss.  The corn is my favorite thing - I passionately love roasted corn. The queso chicharron thing sucks. Most of the tacos are tasty, but I have had better fish tacos...   Their halibut taco sauce tastes like Miracle Whip - I hate miracle whip. The fish was bland.  The ceviche and all salsas I highly recommend.The house salad is definitely a new favorite!!! The torta and half chicken asado is wonderful, and they have tasty, strong margaritas. Try them all!

I love Thai. It is usually gluten-free, and can easily be made vegetarian. They finally got smaller tables and are more comfortable!  The owners are always incredibly nice and love to make sure we enjoy our meals! Thai E-San has superseded ThaiRama as our favorite thai restaurant. Everything is delicious, and they are very accommodating to your needs!

Urban Beans is my neighborhood coffee shop. I could walk here, if I wished.   I am a beverage snob, and definite foodie. I hadn't had their food until recently, so I didn't feel I could have written an adequate review. ;) The service is prompt and the baristas are usually friendly and helpful!  But... Holy biscotti, batman!  I tried the Honey Smoked Salmon Salad and have tried chocolate-orange, and lemon-lavender biscotti. Pastry aside, the food was delightfully healthy, with a touch into decadence, if you so desire.   Each dip of the biscotti in my "Kiss" (Chocolate & Caramel) iced latte was stellar. The biscotti was even moist enough to eat without dipping it into the latte.   The Honey Smoked Salmon Salad was stellar! It wasn't raw salmon, like I expected (I LOVE salmon). The texture with homemade croutons and the crisp, cool greens were a perfect compliment. I don't recall what the dressing was, but it appeared to have dijon mustard grains in it. I would eat this probably about 300 more times... Today. Right now.  My S.O. had a Turkey and Brie sandwich, which he enjoyed... It was wonderful... Cuz I had to steal a bite, myself! ;) It was healthy and served with fresh fruit! I could be biased, however, as turkey sandwiches are my absolute favorite.   The bathrooms are CLEAN and unisex. The patio is lovely in the cooler months, and breezy! Th interior is delightfully vintage, yet urban, in appeal, and clean & comfortable for co-working, or just screwing around online, like co-working tends to lead with me.   My usual order for coffee has become the iced coffee with sugar-free mocha. I cream it to my taste, and carry on. I, admittedly, hadn't had good coffee for awhile, and remembered why I started turning my nose up at bad coffee, upon first sip of their lattes and iced coffee.  Another thing that stands out to me is their array of LOCAL goods!! I'm very pro-local shopping when it's doable, and they bring it right to you with too-tempting popcorn, jellies, oils, teas, and jellies... Just to name a few!  All in all... I can see myself walking here in the cooler months, to enjoy a local, tasty lunch... And doing this quite often! Or even dropping by for my morning coffee fix. ;)

Always my favorite coffee shop.  Too bad the baristas remember my fiancé but not me, even though we always come in together. Pfft.  But that's okay. I can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin. Toasted with just the right preserves, it makes my belly happy. I cheated on my diet but that's okay. Just don't tell my doctor.  I have always been a fan of their food. I did knock this down to 4 stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have. Super sad face.  Also, there was a very loud man in there asking for money, yesterday. But he quickly left. Loud conversation is very distracting. It is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people, but it is still nice!

I was pretty excited to come here. I have been recently diagnosed with celiac disease. They have gluten-free health food, and a LOT of it is vegan. This restaurant specializes in working with food allergies but apparently does not specialize in "flavor".  I love healthy food. Chakra 4 is one of my favorite restaurants, and I love healthy, fresh veggies in their raw form! But they have food that is yummy.  If I wanted rabbit food with balsamic vinegar, well... I could do that! I got the Kitchen Sink salad (had greens, carrots, chickpeas, black beans, jicama, broccoli, mango, and candied walnuts that weren't candied.) that sounded good, but was okay. The roasted butternut squash appetizer quite honestly was the most boring thing I've ever eaten.   I sampled my fiancé's food and it mostly tasted like allspice and not much else (he got the quinoa salad, wild rice, and southwestern soup). All I could smell was allspice - I think. It was something pungent.  Truly disappointed. I probably won't prioritize going back there, but I'm willing to give it another shot.  Yawn.

This bakery is beautiful... She is truly a gifted baker!!! I have tough requirements -- gluten-free AND vegan!  My husband ordered cupcakes from here for my birthday this year, and they were moist and practically melted in my mouth. I loved the red velvet but definitely fell in passionate love with the regular chocolate cupcakes. It was my birthday, so I quickly shoved 4 down my gullet. What? Calories do not count on your birth anniversary, I'm a dietetic student. It's true.  As I fell into a taste trance, I quickly realized that the cupcakes I had been getting at Nami are sad and pathetic... and overpriced. I noticed at Treehouse, day-old goods are reduced in price. This is never the case at nami. It all tastes overly refrigerated and sometimes tofu-like. I don't know about you, but I dislike tasting tofu in my frosting.  I have a bit of a princess-like palate, but I have a right to be as picky as anyone else. Truly, if you need gluten-free or vegan cupcakes, these are better than any cupcake I have had, vegan, gluten-free, or otherwise.

I wish I could give it less stars. I went here because I was so sure I could get something that was gluten-free and dairy-free.  If you have food allergies, DO NOT GO HERE. They cannot tell you what is in their salad dressings. I tried to explain that I had food allergies in a very simple way, and was refused an ingredient list. She said they did not have one and she did not know what was in their "homemade" dressings.   Homemade my ass.  I left. I detest Applebee's but they were much more accommodating.

Taco lovers! I have found our Mecca!  Great customer service! Not many employees but the guy (owner) running the show gives you adequate expectations!   So, our order came more quickly than expected... The beans are fresh tasting and topped with cotija (my favorite). Then I tasted the fish tacos. OH LOVE!  Love!  The salsas were fresh, spicy, and wonderful. I now have a go-to place for tacos! I spent less than 5 bucks and was full!   I wonder if they can invent an endless taco... I'll take one in FISH!

One of my new favorite neighborhood joints. Service was attentive, and listened almost too well. But that was okay, we got two delicious pizzas out of it, and the accommodated to us with the bill, too. I fell in love with their balsamic vinaigrette on the strawberry and gorgonzola salad. Only complaint is that if you choose to get chicken on your half salad, they give you a whole breast - it feels off balance!  The mixed drinks were delicious, and flavorful instead of cloyingly sweet like many places make them. The pomegranate martini was incredible, and the limoncello margarita will continue to give me wet dreams. Swearz.  The fact that I can get egg on pizza, and that they locally source ingredients creates many points in my book! I loved the place! The environment was perfect to facilitate conversation as well!  OH! And Cameron, the guitarist? I am a fan! I can't find him online!

I love coffee shops. I am a big fan of Chef Damon and his restaurant spawn. I was very excited for Nami!  I got the pumpkin spice latte, my bf got the peppermint latte. While the pumpkin spice latte was delicious, I ended up stealing his peppermint latte. Did you know they use peppermint from their own garden for this? TRY IT! It is perfect for the season.  And their oatmeal creme pie? Very lovely for the dairy-deprived. Don't expect it to be the Little Debbie version, however. It is delicious in it's own right.

So, I have had to go gluten-free so I have been checking out their GF treats.  I love the pb bars, and the victory bars. OH and the yankee doodle?! MAGICAL.  NEEDS more cupcakes that are gluten-free though. I want cupcakes.  I love that I can be comfortably vegan and gluten-free as I struggle adding a new restriction to my lifestyle. I have also decided that almond milk makes my favorite latte.  The baristas are always exuberant and friendly and I always feel welcomed.

They're getting sloppy.  While I appreciate the novelty of vegan ice cream (which, most store bought brands are better) with various mix-ins, and vegan baked goods, there is a lot to complain about.  Their facebook touts Hot Fudge Sundays in which affogatos and hot fudge sundaes are $2. We went there and asked for a hot fudge sundae and were met with confusion by the barista who brought over the other girl who explained that they "do not have sundaes but we can put hot fudge on an ice cream cup."   What? Is that not a sundae?! Did you not have this posted on your facebook as a special? They're doing a poor job of making their staff aware.   Additionally, the more I get tsoynamis, the more they're screwed up. They often will leave out ingredients or sometimes change them completely. This is a VERY big deal because I am gluten-intolerant... If I order a GF tsoynami, what is the risk they will add a non-GF ingredient and I won't notice until I ingest a bit?  I don't know... Maybe I am over the novelty, or maybe they're just getting sloppy.

I was so pissed off.  I ordered the Coronado Enchiladas, the special they had last week. They were awful. If I wanted undercooked tortillas with a veggie filling, and taco bell sauce, I could go to Taco Bell. But nontheless, I paid $9.  And they did not replace my crap food for free. I ended up paying $17 total for the Mongolian... Which is good, but not $17 good.  Make sure that you are going to enjoy what you get, because them not owning up to shitty food is a bad idea.

I don't see myself ever going here again.  I really wanted to enjoy it. I love Copperstar coffee, and I love supporting local.   I didn't order barbecue, but I sampled brisket and carmelized pork off my boyfriend's plate. The pork was yummy! And the brisket tasted almost like it was enhanced not by a smoker, but by liquid smoke. Ultimate turnoff. Especially to a Texan that knows, loves, and embraces their BBQ. And he hated the BBQ sauce but I was afraid to try it.  Anyway, I ordered the soup of the day - a vegetarian chili - the Arizona Garden Salad, and a side of baked beans.  As the bowl of a chili I will call nothing short of a "hot mess" came to me, I was immediately disenchanted. It had hominy, corn, black beans, and kidney beans. This flavorless heap of bile wasn't made better by dumping cheese and salt on it. There was little to no seasoning in it, apart from maybe tomato sauce and chili powder. Not to mention they majorly overdid  it on the corn, as the chili was served with corn chips. I struggled to get through it, as I hate wasting food.  Then my salad came - best part of the meal! It was made with fresh oranges, a strong and flavorful dressing, lovely dates, pecans, and feta. This salad was right up my alley.   Then I sampled the beans - allspice. These are not your traditional "baked beans on toast" type of baked beans - no, they were refried baked beans. With spices that did not contribute to the flavor. I like allspice, too. But the flavor was overpowering and I couldn't get past the first bite.

Love this! Not only am I overwhelmed at having so many vegan/GF options, but they still serve Lola coffee, which I am a big fan of.  Great atmosphere. The baristas are more friendly than they were at the Lola, to be quite honest. I went twic elast week and had two perfect lattes, and some wonderful vegan desserts!

I have been going here since it was Urban Beans... I have to say, I am disappointed.   I was a regular at Urban Beans. I loved the food, the service, and the beverages. I noticed the staff changing, and the service changing while the coffee bar underwent many changes, and turned into Tertio.   I went to Tertio a week ago, and I have to say that the food quality isn't quite the same, and the service staff? Some are fine, but there are a few that have obviously never done customer service before. That's putting it lightly.  I am huge on hospitality. I have served plenty of people, and I can understand when people get overwhelmed. I've been there. But when a service staff member does things like, ignores a customer waiting to pay for her order to take out someone's coffee is complete negligence of service. Especially because the other staffer that was there (it was not busy) was simply asking her where the coffee was to go! No, you take care of what is alive and in front of you (payment would have taken 20-30 seconds tops), and then bring out the beverage someone was waiting for anyway.  Seriously. Service is not that hard, people. You would think they'd not want to offer crap service, when an industrious (and usually, quite courteous) Starbucks opened mere steps from their door.   Just. Sayin'.
