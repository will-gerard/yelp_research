The food is awesome. I love the biscuit sandwiches particularly the bumblebee. The cocktails are unique and delicious.  Last night I tried the fried green tomato sandwich and it was out of this world. I took the advice of the person taking my order and added bacon. it was so amazing I want one right now.   I also had the mac and cheese which was amazing. I have not had a bad thing here.  And unlike a lot of the downtown establishments the hipsters working here smile and say thank you and stuff. so refreshing. thanks for being awesome!

So lucky to have such an amazing restaurant across the street. The tacos and burros are outstanding!  I'm updating to five stars because riots has the best enchiladas I've ever eaten. Best beef and guac tacos. Excellent hot sauce. If you aren't eating here I'm sorry for you:(

I would recommend heather to anyone. She's done my hair off and on for the last decade and I've never been disappointed and I leave happy and feeling renewed. The cuts are awesome and last longer than any others I've had. I took a break when I had some financial issues but am so happy to have my hair in good hands again! Thank you so much!

I can't imagine coming back. I have been a couple of times and really don't get the good reviews. There is so much better and for less! But today helped me decide to review. I called ahead to see what was on things. I asked about the nachos and the fajitas. I was told that the fajitas came with guac and sour cream so I ordered them. I go pick them up and not one person smiled at me. There was one other customer and she got no smiles either. When I paid I did get a thank you but still no smile. I paid and waited for my food. There were no straws so I asked nicely for one and was given a look of hate and finally got my straw. how dare I ask for a straw for the $2+ 20oz sprite I ordered. Anywho I go back to work with my food from the angry place and open it up. I figure maybe this will be awesome! Yea no. First of all no salsa, guac, or sour cream to season the lackluster fajitas. And on top of it they give you one tortilla. for fajitas!   So I call. The girl was not that friendly, not that apologetic, and says I will get 20% off my next visit. I work in a huge call center and will make sure that nobody I know goes there so yea probably not going to be using that 20% off coupon. What I want is my $11 bucks back for this unseasoned pile of beans, rice, and chicken.  But thanks anyway...

We came to this Sakana location for my birthday. Usually we go to sakana in ahwatukee and THAT location is amazing! But back to this review. I'd recommend not going. First of all the waiting area and the restaurant was so hot for a July evening.   We tried the let it go roll. It sounded awesome but there was so much spice in the mayo you could not taste the other flavors. I did not pay $15 to taste overspiced mayo instead of fish. The soft shell crab roll was pretty near disgusting. It was burnt and soggy. It tasted overly fishy and the texture was terrible (the soft shell at the other sakana is where I fell in love with it in the first place). We usually leave sakana so fat and happy that the poor quality was surprising. Even the vegas roll was less than. I don't even know how you mess up cream cheese and smoked salmon. It's sushi cheating. I gave it 2 stars because the salmon sashimi was pretty good and we didn't get food poisoning.   I won't come back and if you are thinking of coming here I would really recommend making the treck to sakana ahwatukee.

This facility has really gone down hill. I mean it was never a fancy place to go but I never worried about my safety.  Yesterday I came to walk around on my dinner break. I was entering neighborhood 2 and walking into the carpeted area around johnny rockets. My shoe (a t-strap sandal) got stuck because the plastic that divides the carpeted area and the concrete area. The middle section of my shoe ripped out and I went flying onto the cement area. I really hurt my knees, wrists, and my ankle was twisted.   Clearly I will live but when I called to let them know so that nobody else would be hurt I was treated like I did something wrong by the first person that answered. No apologies were made until the facilities manager realized I was not calling to sue. Now I understand being cautious but it would be nice if at the very least they offered to replace my shoes. I ended up missing two hours of work because I could not very well go back without shoes. I have sore wrists, a twisted ankle, and a barely choked out hollow apology.  Part of me thinks I should speak with my lawyer.  I think I will speak to a lawyer. I was at az mills the other day, many months AFTER tripping messed up my knee and you still have no fixed it!

I had the worst customer service experience that I have ever had at this Hertz location.   I don't use credit cards and they pull a credit report that is not a soft pull and has an effect on your credit if you use Debit. They put a hold on $225 but did not tell me until after they had done it. The woman assured me that as soon as I returned the car it would be put back onto my card. (the money is still not back on my card two days later) This resulted in my not having access to my funds for Christmas weekend.   I picked 10am as a return time not realizing that they don't open until 12 noon. I assumed that dropping the car off when they opened was fine especially considering the receipt warns that if you use the drop box and just leave the car you are responsible for any damages to the vehicle until they can inspect the car. I arrived 5 minutes early and was the first person there. The woman took the keys and then gave me a receipt. I glanced at it to make sure the totals were right and realized she had charged me for an extra day. I asked why and she said it was because I had not dropped the car off at 10am. I asked to speak with a manager because charging for an entire day when they were not even open is insanity. She refused to let me speak with a manager, she refused to give me a corporate number, and she refused to call a manager for me. She said somebody would call me the next day. This was over 24 hours ago and I have not received a phone call.  The outright rude behavior, assault to my credit, bank hold, and charging me an extra day when I did not have the car for that day all adds up to a horrible experience. I will never use this company or this location again and I highly recommend that you think twice before using their services. I was not the only person in their rental office that was unhappy with my service or the company policies.

I have had a really great experience with Dr. Simpson and staff. I had the vertical gastric sleeve on 6/28/2016. I like that he sits down with you and let's you ask questions. His staff is very friendly. In the beginning I felt their was a disconnect on things being explained properly but when I expressed that I was given the answers I needed to make an informed decision.   My insurance only allowed for maryvale hospital and I had some concerns because the hospital is reviewed badly online but I felt like everyone was very friendly and competent. They could be more on top of pain management but that's ok because there is a call button. My one concern was that the hospital didn't seem knowledgeable about bariatric diet. All the clear snacks they brought me were full sugar and when I refused to eat them they misunderstood and somehow thought I was asking for soda instead of sugar free jello. They then condescendingly lectured me about soda and then told me I would be beautiful in a month. I'm already just fine so stop with that beauty nonsense. Very odd but Dr. Simpson and his team came in, talked to me pre op and made me feel comfortable during a scary time.  The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is I feel like you need to be well researched to go to this doctor and a lot of bariatric patients Ive met are not. I felt OK with a somewhat hands off facility because I've researched and gone back and forth about surgery for 3 years. With this doctor there are no hoops other than your insurance hoops and that is good and bad. For me it was great because I've worked with a nutritionist. I've already set up therapy for upcoming changes. Id already done my psych evaluation. I know the diet. I know the differences in procedures but I went to a seminar once that made me realize that not everyone is as diligent about their research and would be lost and possibly be a danger to themselves. I highly recommend being prepared and being your own advocate. Dr. Simpson was recommended to me by someone who knew I was ready and tired of jumping through hoops. I had my surgery within 6 weeks of meeting Dr. Simpson and I feel really good about my choice.  Good luck!

This is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do. I don't know how else to put it. I have been twice because the humane society pays for a visit within five days of adoption. So of course I am going to use the vet visit. From the second I entered the exam room with the vet tech I felt like I was on a car lot and preparing for battle. It is all about up sale and scare tactics at this vet. Which I expected, I have been to corporate vets before. So my cat had an upper respiratory thing that animals in shelters get and the vet put him on antibiotics (incidentally the cost of the antibiotics is about $8 more per bottle than at my small vet office in central phoenix) which is great so we rescheduled for a check up.  I should not have gone. First of all I got shamed and lectured for a few minutes because my cat was not in a carrier. I know this was my bad but seymour never once got out of my arms as I knew he wouldn't because he is a very calm cat. I really did not see the harm and the carrier makes him so anxious. I was compared to a parent who does not put their child in a car seat. awesome.  Next I meet with a new vet tech who tries to upsell me on every vaccine on the market which I politely declined. He then tells me my cat is too fat (yea I know that) and should be 12 lbs. Yea no that is the equivalent of telling a 5 ft 11 large bones woman to aim for 115 lbs. He's a big cat not just fat. So the vet comes in (a totally different vet than I saw last time)  and tells me her name then says wow that is a fat cat you need to get his weight under control or like all fat adults and animals he will likely get diabetes. I am also a fat person so I feel like the lecture was intentional and she did not see that I adopted this animal 2 weeks ago. I have also been to this rodeo a few times and I do not have or make my animals fat. We are on top of the weight loss plan. Unlike the tech because they don't seem to communicate well she tells me he should be 15lbs which is the difference of him losing 3lbs or 6 lbs. Quite a different for an animal under 20lbs! She then says oh his eyes are pretty though just got to work on the weight. What does that mean? Did my cat really get fat shamed? lol hilarious! Then she says oh good I can feel his bladder so he's not too fat for an exam. Really? stop talking about how fat you think he is and say something nice to him while you are molesting his internal organs.  I'll be going to my own vet thanks;)

I moved  to melrose recently and this place is the best. I don't love their coffee because they don't do cold brew but I don't care because everyone here is full of heart and good energy. I came every day when I was IN training for a new job and having a slew of health problems and the people made my day over and over again. For 10 minutes I forgot about life stress. It was like therapy coming in here. Thank you so much for your awesome atmosphere. Also, the banana bread is really tasty!

This is the worst Dilly's I've been to. I came once and a fiasco with their app had me driving around and made me 30 minutes late back from lunch. But they handled it and were very nice. They gave me a gift card.   That lunch was terrible. The Wisconsin cheddar which is typically a thick soup was the consistency of water, the bowl I poured it into started sprouting holes all over my work desk the dilly bird sandwich tasted stale. I threw the majority of a $10 meal away. But I figured I'll use the I'm sorry gift card and go again. Same exact meal. Same exact soup consistency,although it wasn't cold this time, it was warmish. The sandwich tasted Unfresh so I pitched it again. What a waste.  Now I admit to being a food snob so normally I'd blame this on that. I went so often to the one by asu but I was a college student and wasn't as picky about food then. But the thing is, I went to the one on priest and southern a week ago and it was AWESOME! I ate every bite, soup was thick, bowl for the soup didn't sprout stale leaks. I don't know what the deal is but I'll go to priest and southern next time.

I was referred by a work colleague and a little apprehensive because I had waited years for to have this tattoo done. Brandon is the best artist I have worked with. Before I even talk about the skill level I want to mention something that helped me. I do really bad with the typical and gruff tattoo artist deameanor. It's going to be on me forever so I want someone to partner with on the design etc. Brandon does that better than anyone I have met. He walks you through it, he does not shame you when there are tense areas instead he warns you that they are coming up. I could not have imagined a better experience.   Now to talk about the art. Everything about my tattoo is beautiful. the drawing was awesome, and it turned out perfectly. We collaborated throughout the process to make changes whenever necessary. I had three sessions and it looked great each time. I never had an ugly healing period. My healing was so fast. He took the limited information I gave and made it into something beyond my expectations. I don't get through a day that someone does not grab my arm to see it closer (about that...weird strangers...don't touch me).   I can't wait till my next session...  Thank you Brandon!

You guys intervened in a neighborhood that didn't want you. And now you are spreading a dangerous hatred. It is my understanding that the anti lgbtq discussion was brought on by the manager of this location. You should be ashamed for bringing hatred to a strong community on a day that so much senseless death took place.

This place is the best. I brought my ford focus in because it made noises, needed an oil change, and I wanted to get a damage report. I specifically came here because I had a free oil change from a goodie bag I was given. I did research before I came in and was excited to find out it was women run. But still, I was kind of expecting a typical mechanic experience complete with me being scared everything was going to fall apart on the way home. Not the case.  First of all, as many have mentioned, it's beautiful. You feel welcome from the moment you step foot in the shop. There were comfortable couches, artwork for sale and to look at, decent coffee and snacks, clean bathrooms, etc. It was a good first impression!  Secondly, I was greeted by a really awesome lady. I am terrible with names so I apologize but she had amazing curly red hair. I was a jerk and was totally late because I got lost but she was so nice about it. Took my keys and gave me directions to an awesome coffee shop to get breakfast at while I waited.  When I came back the damage was assessed. Not shockingly the car I got at the bad credit lot with the upholstery coming up off the floor had not had a lot of upkeep. It needed about 2k worth of work. I was making a hefty payment for it and certainly did not have that much money. They were kind enough to tell me what was for convenience (aka to make the shaking stop and noises stop) and what was well on its way to killing my car (brown transmission fluid to start). I ended up not doing the work because I decided to trade it in for a new fiat so that I would not have to put money into a worthless car.  Finally, I urge you all to go to 180! I would be sending them all of my business if my car was not totally covered by warranty right now. I tell everyone I know to go. I tell my co-workers, friends, boss, etc. I doubt they listen to me because it's a treck for them but I am working on my cen pho people I promise! Thanks for being so awesome!

I love target. I think I spend a good portion of my paycheck here. I've given you all good business for many years. I had to have surgery recently. A family member took me on a pre surgery shopping spree but I've lost 50 lbs very fast and the clothing was too big. I brought it back and just wanted store credit to get other clothing. I was told the policy is that you can only return one item without a receipt. Now we all know that's not target policy and you are not a franchise so I don't know what utter lunacy was going on. I drove to another location, did my returns, got an $80 credit, spent $500 in the other target. Do you guys see where your math and customer care failed?  I will never be back. Just a horrible experience.

This is the best vet I have found in the central phoenix area. I brought my 19 year old cat in a few months ago because he was having some serious problems. He was my heart and I was so happy to have found a place that treated him so well. He was in Renal failure and they helped with the fluids for months. Unfortunately, he got very sick suddenly over thanksgiving weekend and I had to take him to an emergency clinic to be put down after hours. I had seen one of the vets the day he started getting sick and when I came back to settle my bill they didn't even charge me for my last vet visit.  I feel like this office has a great heart. The sympathy card that was sent to me was signed by multiple people. When you love your pets like I do it feels good to know that the place you are entrusting your animals with cares about them. Thank you for treating Henry so well! I miss him so much but am so grateful that you helped me get some extra months with him.

No, just no. I ordered a sandwich, you were out of the bread. Fine I selected another. You were out of the jelly munchkins. Fine I ordered different ones. Except the guy didn't know what they looked like and you were out of those too so instead brought me a dozen of the driest most stale glazed munchkins I've seen. The glaze was falling off. I told the guy I didn't want them and waited for a refund but his response was, "do you need a straw or something?". Seriously, I've been doing customer service for over 20 years. A) the stale holes should have been free, an apology should have been issued since four of the things I asked for you were out of, and for damned sure a refund on returned merchandise. I'm not expecting more than old burned coffee and subpar frozen donuts at dunkin but you should at least have stocked items and plans for customers when you don't. This is not the first time I've had a similar experience.

I don't trust anyone but Brandon with my pets. My dog was always fearful when I would take him to the bigger corporate groomers. He is just so good with them. I have been getting my toy poodle groomed with Brandon for a couple of years and he always looks awesome and I know he doesn't dread coming in like he has with other groomers in the past. He also gives my dog an awesome mohawk and in the past I had to do the mohawk myself when I got him home. I recommend him to everyone.  I just adopted a cat and he was nice enough to get him in on my day off. The cat was kind of dirty and his nails were overgrown. I knew I could trust him to be gentle with my scared boy and he was a happy boy when I came to pick him up.  It's been mentioned that calls don't get returned and that is a problem but it's easily fixed by booking the appointment at the time of service. It's not a big place and he is almost always working with our pets rather than looking at the phone.  I really appreciate how good you are to my animals!  Thanks, Cami

I'm really discouraged because I like Bliss Rebar and have come in so many times, I recommend them to so many people. I came for brunch with a group yesterday and somehow my card was charged for the 11 bucks that I owed and then charged again for 86 dollars. I called when I realized it had happened, I was going over my bank account and things just were not adding up. I'm on a pretty tight budget so I definitely notice when almost $100 is deducted. The guy who answered the phone was pretty rude. He had no apologies for the inconvenience until the very end of our conversation. He felt that saying 'if you work with us we can then work with you' was an acceptable response. I offered to come down and log into my bank to show the discrepency but he said that that would not be good enough. He then offered me an email address instead of a managers name and phone number to clear the matter up.  The next day I went in person to ask about it and was told that it was probably a void and would show back up in my account later. I really am having a hard time with this. Why was I not informed of a mischarge? why has there been little to no communication. It took 20 hours to hear back from a manager.

I can't decide if I should delete my previous review or just update but I decided to update just to show what good service they do have. The initial experience was sort of negative but the manager (Rachel) did get in touch with me and she has been amazing. I really wasn't made to begin with I just wanted to figure out why I was charged so much for my brunch.  Also, the food is amazing and it is always fun. My brunch was actually awesome aside from the double charge. I had the pretzel french toast and I would recommend it. My favorite thing they have though is the vintage nachos. Seriously amazing. They use flaky flour tortilla chips and this amazing queso. The sliders are also really good. I have been going to Bliss Rebar for years so I am glad that everything worked out.  Thank you Rachel!

We came in again last Saturday. The food was fine but the service was terrible. We had a server who was very pale, pinkish blonde hair, and didn't smile. We aren't too picky and didn't care that much that we had to wave her over for things like water and coffee. We were more interested in enjoying our company but what I do have a problem with is getting orders wrong TWICE and not comping my roommates meal. She is lactose intolerant and gluten free so eating out can be stressful but breakfast is really easy. She ordered the chorizo scramble and wanted bacon added and no cheese. SO EASY. It came to her with NO BACON and EXTRA cheese. She sent it back. It came back with no cheese and NO BACON. She was so hungry at this point and we had finished eating so she just didn't say anything. I said something because it's ridiculous. I don't even think the woman apologized. When I mentioned she again did not get the bacon the woman just gave her a side. Not the same as having it in the scramble as she asked for. Twice at this point.  You guys should not have charged her for the meal and certainly should not have charged her EXTRA for the very late bacon. I think I am giving up on saturday brunch at Bliss Rebar. So many other places get the customer service AND the food right.

I have been eating here and enjoying cartel coffee since before you were too cool to crack a smile or I don't know be polite. unkept hair and a vacant expression doesn't do much for my restaurant experience.  I have been very forgiving because I loved this place when we found it after you opened. I came for the biscuits and gravy and got an enormous pubic hair on top a few months ago. That was my first bad experience. Not because of the hair because let's be honest, shit happens and we all shed, but there was no apology. No omg that is awful let me get you a new one!!!! Instead the guy with perfected hipster hair said oh i don't think it's a pube just a wiry hair. seriously??  I came three weeks ago with my 5lb dog. I carried him in so I could order and he would not freak out. The manager just stared at me like I had active head lice and monotonously took my order. She then said you can wait outside. LOL I know I had a dog and I wanted nothing more than to get outside. But you still say thank you for buying something in my establishment or at least say hey...jerk...get that dog out of here. On this occasion the breakfast potatoes were not cooked. I said nothing because I didn't want them anyway.  So today I stop in because I have a paper to write. First of all nobody smiles, nobody says hey, nothing. Then I order and wait quite awhile. So I see her with my food and smile and say I think that's mine. I get no smile in return. Instead she says you didn't take a number. i'd have known if you had taken a number. And she leaves without giving me the silverwear. The biscuits were stale and dry but again I said nothing because this time I know I am over it.  You know your crepes are decent, coffee is awesome, but your people are unfriendly and you are not half as cool as you think you are. I work too hard for my money. I'm gonna go to phoenix market, they sell the same coffee and never put pubes in my food. They also say thank you.

This place is hilarious! We went with family. My cousins step mom was trying to make sure to include her boyfriend in holiday fun since he is vegan and she did not realize that there was a difference between raw and vegan food. Understandable mistake. Everyone was totally willing to try something new BUT this place is like a bad episode of Portlandia.   The menu sounded ok. We were told to sit and the chef would come around and tell us what on the menu we were studying was available for the day. We said ok and started reading the extensive menu. We ordered some tea. The lemon one was great but the Hibiscus tea my cousin and I ordered tasted like we were licking the earth. It was disgusting. So we asked if we could just trade it out for the lemon or if she could just take them away. The server seemed nervous and said she would ask the chef. She came back without asking the chef and said that she would fix the problem by putting coconut sugar in it. We tried it and let her know that it was still just not our cup of tea. FINALLY she agreed we could switch teas.   At this point we had been sitting for about 20 minutes waiting for the famous chef to let us know what we were allowed to order off of the menu. Still no sign of her except to ask if the door open was making us cold. We decided to pay for our teas and cut our losses. If you have a craving for raw food, the desire to be in cave creek, and 4 hours to kill this might be the place for you. I will stick with cooked vegan food at Green or Braggs Factory Diner.

I was really excited to join you fit because it was inexpensive and easy. supposedly. I have had a couple of problems with them since I joined.   The first was  the repeated calls I got bothering me to do personal training. I would try to call back to ask that they not call me and nobody ever answered the phone. I was really disappointed in them selling to me on my phone. I was assured that they were a no hassle gym which was why I joined in the first place. They proved to be a hassle and stalk just like pure fitness.   The second issue was that after only having the membership about 2 months they charged me for yearly maintenance. It felt like a scam since supposedly the charge is in case you stay past the one year mark.   The third issue is in trying to cancel my membership. I have the 19.99 membership which is for a year. I moved to California after losing my job this summer. You fit would not let me out of my membership even though they do not have gyms in this area. I have to pay out the length of my membership. When I asked for a corporate number I was given an email address by a very cheerful manager.   Thirdly is the customer service. The woman I just spoke to was very cheerful. Having done customer service for decades I understand that that is passive aggressiveness at its finest. She knew I was upset (though I never raised my voice) but opted to be condescending instead of helpful. I think their slogans are misleading. I have never had a company not let me out of a contract when they don't offer those services in the area I am moving too. Typically they give a 50 mile allowance. I would love it if they were in Long Beach but alas they are not, yet they are making me pay for a membership that I cannot use. I would think twice before signing a contract with youfit. I'm very disappointed that I did. There are absolutely strings attached to this gym membership.

I wish I could give no stars or negative 5 stars. I did what they asked. I was told to send in a certified letter (which was a total pain but I did it) asking to cancel my membership in November so that my December payment would not go through. I DID THAT. They of course charged me for December. They claimed to have told me that I would have to pay December, this is not true. They told me quite clearly that November would be my LAST payment. My contract started December 2nd 2011. They are forcing me to pay for another December per my 12 month contract. Perhaps the people at you fit are not great with math. Charging me for another December is 13 months not 12. They would not let me speak to a manager. Instead the girl I spoke with kept placing me on hold, going over the account with a manager, coming back and speaking to me again, offering me no further assistance. She did not hang up on me she just stopped speaking till I finally just released the call. WORST customer service experience ever.   And to clarify, I have just paid for 4 months of a gym membership that I cannot use because they have NO LOCATIONS in Long Beach. This is experience is so ridiculously bad I cannot even wrap my head around it.    GO TO A BETTER GYM!  Preferably one who will not charge you monthly after you lost your job and have to move to another state, a state where they don't provide service.

My friends and I came here for my birthday this weekend. It was amazing. From the amazing service, to how dog friendly they were with my poodle, to how COLD their pool is, to the free drinks we got with our room, to tim, who brought our bags to the room and brought us games and ice. It was a blissfully perfect staycation. I looked forward to coming to the hotel palomar for a couple of months and I was not disappointed.  We ended up not having to pay for parking because of the special we got but that would be the one thing that would deter me from a 5 star review. Phoenix just isn't the type of city to procure $30 parking fees.  If you are a dog lover this is the place. They brought my dog a bed, dishes, placemat, and allowed him to go everywhere I went.   I can't wait till the next staycation!  Thank you:)

First of all I hate giving local businesses bad reviews but after going to this place twice I had to review it.  I know they are not known for their nachos but I love nachos and when I was told they had good nachos I wanted to try it asap. The first time I got chicken nachos. They were covered in Chicken. I could not taste the chips, cheese, guac, because it was just all chicken. They give few chips. Literally I picked off a pile of chicken on a plate and I still had more than I knew what to do with in the nachos. I kind of wrote the place off because the nachos were almost inedible.   Then comes tonight. I was craving nachos again. They are so close that I figured I would give it another shot and just get them vegetarian this time. Again they were skimpy on chips, when I said no meat they did not offer any beans or anything to substitute the beans. So I got the guacamole again which they charged me extra for. When I got the total I asked if I was charged the same as with meat and the unsmiling person ringing me up said yes. Not only did I get charged the same as I would have with a pile of meat on my nachos but they charged me extra for guac! A few chips and some cheese should not cost 9 dollars. I can go to Tico's and get vegetarian nachos with veggies, beans, guac, etc for a similar price and they are twice as large.   The cheese was completely hard and there was more pico than chips. Really unimpressive.  They could learn something from chipotle and give the vegetarians their guac for free if they are going to charge them for the meat they are not eating.  Never again.

I really enjoyed my hair cut and waxing today. I would give a five but I am not thrilled with my nail service. I will explain at the end because it's not a big deal it's just not a service I would use again.  Vanessa did my hair. It's wonderful. I love aline hair cuts and she did such a perfect cut. It's hard to find someone who really cuts your hair well. I can see 5 stylists and not get a cut that I love. I leave feeling presentable but today I left feeling like my hair looked awesome. I'm actually excited to show it off. She is also really personable and sweet. Thank you so much for a great experience!   Taylor did my eyebrows and she did a great job. I felt really at east which is rare for me. Part of why I came into the salon is because I am plus size and there was a really nice thing on the website welcoming plus sized ppl to waxing. If you are not plus size you have no idea how intimidating that can be depending on if someone is sizist. I only get brows and lip done but it's great to know I can do more here!  Now about the nails. If I could do a separate review for this I would because I loved my salon experience. But I did not enjoy my nail service. When I used to go regularly it was at a nice little asian shop. The person I went to does such a nice thorough job that I was always pleased. My nails were not cleaned when she did them today. They were dirty when she painted them. Granted that's my fault but usually with a manicure your nails end up nice and clean! Also there are gaps on the side where there is no color, only some of the cuticles were dealt with. I had to request this and then I was told to go to a doctor. I just felt weird. But my main issue is one of customer service. I don't know why the nail tech started asking me about family. As someone who works customer service I would recommend not asking personal questions and keeping it light ;) I do appreciate the service though.  Overall I loved my experience and will be back!

The problems:  One of the first problems I have had is profiling. I had my car ticketed three times in the first 6 months. My car was a 2006 ford focus and not especially appealing to look at. It was ticketed so many times and one of them was for being 'inoperable' and the sticker wsa placed in my view on the drivers side I contacted the office and Laurie (the manager) told me that they have to make sure that tenants are taken care of and that they have parking. I truly don't think she realized how silly telling me she needed to worry about the tenants was when she was talking to a tenant. Security apologized and I forgave and took down my review.  The first month I lived here my building set on fire. It was in July on my birthday. I would never have known we were on fire except I had to take my dog for a walk. When I went to the office the next day to inquire on the buildings safety the office staff had no idea there had been a fire. I think it was a car that set on fire too close to the building but it was strange they did not know about it.  We had no winter this year and the units were hot from mid january on. Seriously muggy in my apartment and there are no fans in unit. There was also no screen in my camper size window. When I went to the office they agreed to replace the screen but said I should go buy a fan and hopefully in a couple of months we could use the ac again. Fast forward to late february. All of us were told on yelp we could have a window unit because it was so hot but when we went into the office there were no window units available. Finally Laurie told me that they turned the electric to ac and it would be on within 3 days. 3 days turned into more than a month. Every time I inquired I was told there was a slow leak, it was an old building, and hopefully it would be working 'next week'. And a monthish later it was.  Right after the air finally turned on, another building breakage happened. Our hot water went out (just in my building, again) I did not find out by getting a note on my door, I found out by being doused in ice cold water at 6am. I had to be late to work in order to wait for the office to open and figure out what was going on. The response? Oh someone was supposed to send out a notice, hot water is off for awhile. Seriously?? And awhile was a week. This affected my job and my home life. unacceptable. It was off for a week. The assistant manager said she was trying to work to get us some kind of compensation for the inconvenience but of course nothing ever happened and we did not get so much as an apology or told when the water was back on.  Next up was the flood. I was doing homework in my living room at around 9:30pm enjoying some mindless tv when I could swear I heard running water. I kept ignoring it because why would there be running water? I wasn't running anything. Sure enough there were a couple of inches in my kitchen and bathroom. Not shockingly nobody called me back when I left a message on the emergency line. When I finally got in touch with someone they had already talked to another affected tenant. I was told they would check the apartment for mold once they figured it out but to my knowledge that didnt happen. Three days later someone came to clean. For real?? You think I would leave nasty pipe water in my KITCHEN for three days? I had immediately thrown away the food, cleaned the kitchen, and thanked my stars my lease was almost up.  So I sent my notice to vacate and asked the manager to call me with my pro rated amount. I emailed a couple of times and never got a response. I came into the office twice when finally the new assistant manager was able to give me a tally. Great. I had a witness because I know how this place is run and I had her give it to me in writing. I figured I was home safe and could wait till my move out date which is in a week. So last night a friend was meeting at my apartment and I was running late picking us up pizza and packing wine when I see that my friend is calling me. I answer and she says you have a notice on your door, it says you have not paid rent. Which is baffling to me since I did pay rent and on further exploration they cashed my check. So I again contact the complex and the answer I get is 'well we were understaffed friday and corporate would be mad if we did not give out the 5 day notices. there was no time to check out if anyone had prorated time frames'.  The old assistant mgr told me they were always happy to place my packages at my door or in my apt. It was so nice because my work hours are long and 6 days a week so I miss office hours. I had an important package being delivered and asked if someone cld drop it or place it outside since I was on my way home. The new guy Leo said no and that I should not be asking him to do that. He then admitted he was being rude but that I deserved it for asking for ridiculous things. I've done cust service a long time. I was floored.  Rent elsewhere.

I really expected better. I have been waiting almost a year for something to fill the market space. I loved the phoenix market and was so sad when they lost their grant. They had the most amazing breakfast foods at an affordable price. I had great hopes when I found out that St. Francis was opening the public market cafe.   I went this weekend. My friend and I had the breakfast sandwich and another friend had the fritatta.   First of all it was overpriced. The sandwich came out on a HUGE plate. You could have fit 4 sandwiches on this large white plate but all that sat on it was my sandwich. Not so much as a piece of parsley to garnish and make necessary the enormous plate.   My friends fritata was way late because oatmeal came out instead of a fritatta. And instead of instantly rectifying the situation the server asked more than once if we were sure the oatmeal had not been ordered!   The bread looked spectacular but in reality it was not grilled/toasted/or warmed in any way and had the texture of stale bread. The sandwich lacked any real flavor and had to be doused in hot sauce. Now I love hot sauce but when I pay 10 bucks at a counter for a sandwich and a can of soda I expect that I won't NEED to use it.  My friend who ordered the fritatta also had to douse it in hot sauce.   I kind of expected a lot more. I have a lot of breakfast options in downtown/midtown phoenix. I even have multiple options right at the market. Unless they get a handle on the food at the new cafe I won't be making this a regular event after the market.

This place is not bad and not great. I came in today for some eggs after the gym, it was maybe 3:02pm and breakfast is over at 3 and I was denied. Now I get that I was 3 minutes late but really??? Couldn't have made me an egg?? That's just ridiculous to lose business over 2 minutes.

I just had a terrible experience at this location. First, 6 cars just waited over 20 minutes. Second, I was just charged a full dollar more for my coffee than at any other location I frequent.  The response? Oh well I pushed a button and that's your price. They probably just know you at the other location.  Seriously? I won't be back and I'll be encouraging everyone I know to follow suit.

I wish there were more stars to give. I've loved this place since it was just a food truck but their restaurant is above and beyond. I could go on and on about how awesome their food is but you really just need to know a few things: they have awesome apetizers, the pizzas are unique and delicious (I recommend the fun guy with pineapple), vaquero burger is probably my favorite burger ever, 10 different kinds of mac and cheese (that alone should bring you to their door), and awesome salads. Oh and they have both vegan and gf options if you have dietary challenges.  SOOO now let's talk about my favorite part of the package. amazing service. I am a service freak. If you have poor service I'm likely to never return and to write a review about my limited free time being ruined. The opposite is true here. Pizza people has FANTASTIC, AMAZING, ABOVE, AND ABOVE AND BEYOND SERVICE. Seriously, top notch. One time, I ordered online and the fax never came through. They comped half my meal and gave me a desert just because I had to wait ten minutes.   And today the owner was pitching in and helping serve when they were busy and had a backup. Some ranch fell off of a plate and fell on the ground LIGHTLY splattering our way. The manager gave us more apologies that we deserved, gave us 50% off of our meal, and a bunch of awesome coupons.  I first came to pizza people because I love the fun guy. but now I go to pizza people because they are the nicest people and as a perk they have a fun menu and awesome drinks.  Best addition to DT in a long time.

I love this park! The people are always really friendly. The park is well maintained and the dogs always have so much fun. I think a lot of the parks are hit and miss but this one seems to have a strong sense of community. I feel like it's Cheers for my dog, people always remember him and his name.

I came in today and was ordering eggs when the person at the counter mentioned someone wrote a Yelp review about rude service about eggs. I exclaimed, "it was me!!!" Haha. Well Rachel (if I have your name wrong, I apologize), you made my experience so much better and my food was excellent. Thanks you!

The carne asada burrito with guac is one of the best carne asada burros I've ever had. This place is right behind where I live and I wasn't expecting much but I was wrong. It's another excuse to walk my dog;)

Another amazing creation from Brad and Kat! We have had a couple of different types at shortleash but we went to the grand opening today and it was awesome. We came a little late and they were almost out of everything (yay for them!).  They are really unique. I was not in a donut mood today so I just got tea but because they were out of what I wanted the girl at the register gave me a thai coconut donut to go (so nice!). It was really unique. It was full of sweet and spicy. I highly recommend!

I hate giving this a bad review, I really do but...ewww. My friend and I both had the red velvet waffles and chicken. I was so excited because I love chicken and waffles. It was so disgusting. I am still having to stifle the urge to gag when I think about what the chicken looked like underneath the fried goodness. It was largely gristle and it was all dark brown meat. I have never had fried chicken and waffles and had it not be white meat so I guess I never thought to ask. My friend's was white so for her it was a great experience but for me I am still nauseated hours later.  ALSO the restaurant was so warm that our server had sweat spots covering the underneath of her arms. Had I not been wearing black I probably would have showing signs of how hot I was too. I know my hair was killed before the show at gammage.  The restaurant is cute. But you gotta work on the food and ac. for realzzzzzz.  I miss ihop. They used the ac AND I was never fed grizzle.

Changing the name from cabanas to the Prescott does not change how bad this complex is. Unless mark Taylor is planning to gut the property and redo everything it's still the same horrible complex with a new paint job. Fire, flood, broken Ac, no screens, bugs, threats of towing for having an old car. Worst place I've ever lived.

I had such a good experience here a couple months ago with the owner so I keep coming back but it's not been good. The last two times I have come the girl who has worked on me speaks no English. I am not some jerk that cares what language people speak but the problem is she hurts me and other than yelping I can't get her attention. She left dirt and debris in the sides of my toes. I kept pointing to them (they were red and painful, most nail techs would have noticed, especially when I yelped every time she touched my toes) and she wld just smile at me. It hurt and I raced home to fix my toes myself. This was the first time she also did my fingers. First of all because of the language barrier I did not get what I wanted. I had a picture but she kind of ignored me. The owner was supposed to do my fingers but took another client which kind of sucks because I actually made an appointment.   Color of nails aside she cut mine too short and now they are puffy and painful which kind of sucks when you have a desk/computer job. She cut skin that needed to stay attached. I'm really disappointed as I don't treat myself that often.

I am so sad to give this adorable place a bad review but it was so bad. I love vegetarian food and wanted to surprise my friend with a new vegetarian place. Everything looked awesome. We decided to share some things so we got potato tacos, fried guacamole, and the monte vista sandwich. All three were bad. First of all, this is Phoenix, street tacos should not have fat store bought tortillas and the guacamole should not have store quality chips. Both were fat and heavy. The guacamole was ok but honestly you don't need to fry it, just make good guacamole. The potato tacos were bad. Instead of a mashed mixture it was chopped up fries. Same texture as the fries that came with the sandwich. The sandwich was terrible. I honestly don't know how you can't make these ingredients work but it was terrible. I don't know what they fried the zucchini in but it was bad and unnecessary. Just grill it! We basically ate the veggies out of it and took the breading off.  The baked goods looked good but we just couldn't try anything else. I hope the Coronado plays with their recipes because I want to love you but right now I can't think of a worst downtown restaurant.

I came in for the first time today.  I am in pain tonight. I have ingrown nails on my big toes. Skilled nail techs don't have a problem with it. This lady cut so far down my toe was filling with blood. She kept squirting something on the nail that stung but didn't heal it and was not first aid of any kind. She ended up ripping the good skin off and now both large toes are bright red and sore.   When she was exfoliating my foot with the grater tool on my toes she was looking and talking to another client and I had to let her know she was hurting me.  When she did the mani it was ok but towards the end she was running to a client at the pedi bowl and then back to me. The biggest issue I had was there was sloppy painting so she kept digging her nail around mine. I have a huge problem with that. It's not legal and the reason it's not legal is because it puts people are risk of bleeding and spreading disease.   She was very sweet but the pain and rawness of my feet really isn't ok. Not when I paid almost $70.

I really love this place. The drinker noodles are my favorite but everything I've had is good. I didn't do five stars because every time I get take out I get the wrong order. It's always good but never what I ordered. Check before you leave with take out ;)
