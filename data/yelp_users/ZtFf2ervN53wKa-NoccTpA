I was super hungry after a delayed flight. Yelp came to the rescue once again by leading me to this super yummy spot. Went with the Machaca combo based on two recommendations by locals. I was also told to try the green burrito. Several people in line in front of me ordered that. Bottom line, the food was bomb!   Four stars cause I hate driving to this neighborhood, but screw it - I'm coming here EVERY chance I get!

This place will surely send you home on a full and satisfied stomach.  I ordered the steak and rib combo with the loaded mashed potatoes.  The ribs were definitely my favorite.  I've had better, but these were decent.  I really enjoyed the dinner rolls with the cinnamon butter.  It's that killer sweet tooth that I just can't seem to kick.  Excellent service.  The manager came by to welcome me as a first timer.  Gave me a card for a free appetizer on my next visit.  Now that's customer service!

First and foremost, the service here is over the top spectacular. It is very apparent that they pride themselves on customer service at this Marriott; they should be billboard models for the way customer service should be executed the correct way by Marriott standards. I was astounded that EVERYONE from the valet to the front desk associates, to housekeeping, maintenance crews and pool side team members all greeted me with sincere "hello's" every single day. They all wore proud smiles and represented Marriott the Buttes exquisitely. One morning as I was exiting the building, a gentleman, who I presume was a part of the engineering/maintenance crew asked me how I was enjoying my stay. Wow! That was enough to make me want to extend my stay further. And, I should note, I was guest at this lovely hotel for 7 nights.  This is by far one of my favorite places to stay when my choice is to reside in Phoenix versus Scottsdale; my choices very slightly when my visit is on the Scottsdale side. First and foremost, the service here is five-star an absolutely spectacular! Liz check me in and was quick to acknowledge my status as a Marriott elite member. I always love when Marriotts to go out of their way to spread the love to their elite. I also enjoyed being parlayed to my room following The golf cart. I was placed in a beautiful room on the second floor of the resort side slightly facing the pool. Mind you, there is no room at this resort with a "pool side view" there maybe two rooms at best with a slight view. That said, I believe I had the best room at the resort. Why? First, it had the patio. Here the patios are slightly shared, I'll be it, and a resortlike saying. I also loved that I could look up and view the pool-side umbrellas and poolside ambiance. I also let that only had to do was simply walked out of my room and out to my favorite pool which is more on the "adult side". Last, loved that they place me close to an elevator and plenty of parking.  The star of the show is undoubtedly the pool area. Everything about this place is spectacular, but that it is tucked into the Butte in a resort like setting with waterfalls in a waterslide is just fabulous. I will always be loyal guest here.  Downsides are definitely the lack of dining options and proximity to nearby restaurants and eateries; there is a Taco Bell, WhataBurger, and Rally's near the hotel; none of these places are my cup of tea. I branched out further to the ASU area, the Mill St. Corridor for good eats. For lunch/sandwiches pass up Jimmy Johns and subway and head to Ike's - highly recommended. Marriott the Buttes is not in in the best area. It's definitely not Scottsdale with Kierland Commons and Scottsdale Fashion Square. However, the moment you take a turn into this resort you're instantly transformed into an oasis. I absolutely adore this place and you will too!   Thanks Marriott the Buttes, you guys definitely set the bar high for Marriott customer service around the world. You rock!

Had the almond milk tea and it was just okay.  It was watered down and lacked flavor.    The service here is definitely not the best, but it stays pretty busy.  I suppose you have to know the right thing to order.  I prefer Volcano because the the service is outstanding and the boba teas blow this place out of the water .

I live in Cali so my loyalty is to Roscoe's, but I must admit that Lo-Lo's is just as good.  The service was absolutly wonderful, so that made my dining experience even better.  LOVED the sweet tea - it was perfect! The greens were phenomenal and that waffle...OMG!  I can't wait to get back to Phoenix just to get another piece of the red velvet cake!

This place is cash only folks!  I ordered the Korean chicken and a small siamin soup with wonton. The line was long, but moved quick. I was hoping to get the Korean chicken and Korean barbeque special, but it was not offered. The lady at the cash register recommended that I call ahead for the specials, as that one had not  been offered in a very long time. The food was pretty good for the price. I would return, especially given the fact that Leopalds Ice Cream is just across the way. The only other time I get to enjoy macademia nut ice cream is at the Hilton Hawaii Village location in Honolulu.

I frequent Las Vegas, and such food on the strip gets to be a bit redundant.  While visiting this past July, I decided to take fellow Yelper's advise and drive to Viva Mercados.  I am so happy that I did.  This has to be one of the best Mexican Food places in all of Las Vegas.    This restaurant is quite a ways off the strip, so you will definitely need a car to get here.  I went to dinner around 7 or 8 pm and was seated immediately.   The warm tortilla chips, beans and salsa are delicious.  I have never dined at an establishment that offered beans for dipping, but it was the bomb!  It's hard to stop eating it, but be for warned - do not fill yourself up on chips and dip because the entrees are huge.  I ordered the carne asada burrito wet with red sauce - OMG!  Ridiculous.    The service was really good, they are extremely attentive to your every need.  I cannot wait to go back.  The prices - very reasonable  If you are in the mood for good Mexican food, I highly recommend Viva Mercados.

Not only is the food delicious, but the value is outrageous. When was the last time you ate at a higher end steak house (not Outback folks) that included soup or salad and choice of potato? Enough said! If you're like me, then you've dined at many of the Vegas steak houses: N9NE, Strip House, Morton's, Delmonico's, etc. One thing is consistent among all of them - sides are sold ala carte. Not at The Steak House. Here, your $60 dollar steak includes choice of black bean soup (french onion for an extra charge) or salad and choice of potato.   The black bean soup was accompanied by sherry wine and red onions. The explosion of flavors after adding the sherry and onions was fabulous! Their black bean soup definitely gives Georges "famous black bean soup" in La Jolla, CA a run for its money. I ordered the 12 oz filet butterflied. I regretted not ordering the 9 oz after eating one too many bites of the black bean soup. That said, the filet was delicious. I also got to taste the bone in ribeye. My oh my was that fantastic!   The service was wonderful. They wait on you hand & foot and your glass will never be empty. The best part - the food comes out fast.   Why only 4 stars? My garlic mashed potatoes were absolutely divine, however, they were served cold. I like my food piping hot. Not a problem, they quickly resolved the problem. Also, the restaurant was way too dark, making it difficult to read the menu let alone try to eat your food. It could also stand to be updated, but, then again, it is in Circus Circus.  Overall, I had a fantastic dining experience. I will definitely return, and I highly recommend it.  Bravo The Steak house! Well done.

LOVED this show!   After seeing Mystere over the 4th of July holiday I was not expecting much. I was very disappointed, but Zumanity peeked my interest. I was actually very impressed. It kept my attention the entire time - and my poor boyfriend couldn't seem to keep his mouth closed, especially when little miss hula hoop girl was on the stage workin her magic! LOL, That's okay, because I was very engaged when Mr. Chocolate Thunder came Rollin out and started flipn tricks in the tub...Lord how mercy! Now you know they were wrong for that.   I highly recommend Zumanity.

Forget what you heard. Yes, the decor is horrendous. Yes, the servers are dressed in severely dated threads. And yes, the wait can be long and cramped. It's all worth it once you sink your teeth into one of the best hang over meals in Vegas.  I had the tostada omelette and a huge mimosa. I also got to taste the chicken fried steak. Everything was delicious.  The service is friendly and efficient.   Just go!

Ditto Chip K's Review.   I have seen La Reve, Mystere and Zumanity.  Mystere was by far the WORST of them all.  I would not pay to see Mystere again.  The only reason the BF and I went was because we got an awesome package deal at TI.  Agreed -  The male performer dressed in a baby suit rolling the gigantic orange ball off the stage was awful.  The continuous crying by this character became extremely annoying and seemed out of place.  Overall, I would not recommend this show...unless you get in for free.

KA was by far my favorite and most memorable Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas.    This show was awesome.  Non-stop action throughout - revolving stage, puppet shows, acrobatics and other scenes with special effects keep your attention the entire time.    The show itself is not cheap but ask for the "buy one get one 50% off special or summer promo".  They seem to offer promos quite a bit, especially in this economy.  If you don't ask, they will not offer it to you.   I will definitely go back to see KA!

The Foundation Room Restaurant is for members only on most nights, however, the food, service and views is worth every penny. Truly, this place holds one of the very best views in all of Las Vegas.  The Foundation Room is highly recommended.

The bf and I dined here after the the 7pm showing of Mystere.   Loved it! I must say, I was not expecting the food to be so good, but it was delicious.   The chips and salsa were so addicting. The chips are served with three different salsas that all quenched my palate in a different way.   La Isla is known for their Tequila, so of course I had to order a margarita. It was the best margarita I have ever had!   For the entree, I ordered the carne asada burrito "wet". OMG - so good! The only downside was that the burrito seemed to be a bit on the small side. However, I am from San Diego, so perhaps I am a bit biased when it comes to Mexican Food. Regardless, I would order that burrito again and again.   The Service - Top Notch. Like Kevin W., our server was also extremely friendly and attentive. We were waited on hand and foot. In fact, she is what made our dining experience so wonderful.   Next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely be dining at La Isla.

Disgusting and completely overpriced.   The wait is extremely long - 45 minutes to 1 hour and the food is mediocre at best.  The Wynn should definitely go back to the drawing board on this one.

The Wynn buffet came highly recommended, so after a special night out at La Reve the bf and I strolled over for a late night buffet.  The line was extremely long at 10:00 PM so we figured this had to  be good.  The moment finally arrived 1 hour later.  We paid the $75.00 total and followed the hostess to a dining section that had a bit of a circus feel.  There were screaming kids running around everywhere.  I realize this is a buffet, but this should've been my que to run for the door!  Again, we took the high road and decided to make the best of it...after all this was the Wynn so of course the food would be worth it.  I am very disappointed to report that the food was not good, definitely not worth $75.00.  Now I will be honest, I don't really like buffet's, but the bf loves them, so of course I had to compromise.  Even he was disappointed in the food.  The deserts look appetizing, however, in my opinion the best food selection was the fake Pho.  I've heard the seafood buffet at Rio and brunch buffet at Bellagio are far better than at the Wynn.  I will not be returning to the Wynn buffet.

Heard this location is under new management and is experiencing some issues. My last visit was last October, so this review will be based on that experience.   Maggiano's is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Why? Because it's great food, healthy portions, and outstanding value for what you get. I always leave satisfied and the service has always been wonderful. Visited the Santa Ana, CA, Chevy Chase, MD, and Tyson's Corner, VA locations - all the BOMB!   My favorites:   Rigatoni 'D'  Chicken Parmesan - I order this with a side of pasta and meat sauce since the chicken parm does not come with it  Apple Crostada  Peach Bellini - Now you know I have to have a cocktail with dinner!   I've also sampled the spaghetti which is also pretty good. Honestly, I've had better though.   Maggiano's is one of the last locations on the strip that offers a classy upscale atmosphere without the pretentiousness and is extremely affordable and family friendly.  I highly recommend Maggiano's.

I would have to agree with Jacqueline. If the vote was between the Wynn, Bellagio, and Carnival World Buffets - my vote would be for Carnival World.   I will be the first one to admit that buffets are not my favorite. However, my friends love them and I find that each time I go I find something that I like. This is because there is so much variety and there is generally something for everybody...even picky eater's like me.   I have been to the Buffet at the Wynn and I was not impressed. I have also been to the Buffet at the Bellagio - It was okay, but the buffet is way overrated in my opinion. However, I truly enjoyed Carnival World Buffet. This is probably because I love fried shrimp, calamari, waffle fries, pizza, sushi, etc and Carnival World put all these things on the map! Now, if you love somewhat undercooked (or red) flavorless lamb chops, grilled lamb, ribeye steaks, duck, prime rib, vous de vous (sp) baked pastas and cold crab legs, California rolls, salmon and tuna sashimi, then Bellagio Buffet is the way to go. The food at Bellagio looks really good and will impress anyone at first site. However, the food did not warrant a 1 hour wait. Carnival World is definitely worth the wait.

I landed in Vegas around noon and needed a quick bite to eat. This place didn't disappoint. I ordered the 2 piece combo which came with a piece of the yummiest texas toast for $5.99. Great service? Yes. Cheap & quick eats? Definitely. The BOMB sweet tea? Oh yeah!  I'll definitely return.

The BF took me here for a romantic dinner.  I must say, the view is amazing.  I was in absolute awe the entire time.  It's enough to make you fall in love all over again.  A photographer even came to take photo's of us (for a fee of course) and they came out fantastic.  They were true quality.    I agree that the food was just okay, but the fact that they wait on you hand and foot makes the vist worth while.    Overall, I truly enjoyed my experience and would consider doing it again after visiting other establishments such as the Eiffel Towel Restaurant.

I love the romantic ambiance of Tao. We had dinner here on a Sunday night and it was a full dining room; that said, we opted to be seated in the cozy booths just prior to entering the main dining area. It was a great choice.  We ordered the famous Food Network's "Best Foods (Things?) I Ever Ate" Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bads and it was amazing! We also ordered the Thai Crispy Pork and Mandarin Sizzle Fried Rice. Both were fantastic.   Service was okay, I've experienced better in Vegas. One of the manager's came by to ensure we were having a great dining experience. That was a nice touch. However, I do wish our server took the opportunity to check in on us. He was essentially ghost after our meals were served.  I will definitely return to try more items.

We needed hang over food after a long NYE. Lucky for us, most people were still hung over in bed, because we arrived at 11:00 am on New Years Day and we were seated immediately-score!  The server and chef were funny and friendly. Loved that the food is made hot and fresh right before your eyes. We were given dinner rolls to munch on, but I was told to save it to dip in my food. We ordered the Palace Pan Roast and Gumbo. My favorite of the two was the pan roast; it was packed with shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, and crab. The gumbo was good, but not as good as my mama's:)   This place definitely hit the spot. I'll definitely return to try the étouffée.

The lobster mashed potatoes were ORGASMIC!   We shared that ginormous 20 oz bone in Ribeye and it was fantastic, the very essence of a true dry aged steak.   I also enjoyed my 2010 Graff Riesling.  My only disappointment was our server Lisa. She never really bothered to check on us. We had to flag sevdral other staff menbers down for refills, accompaniments, etc. Her only attempt to engage with us was after our check was delivered, and even then it was only to inquire as to whether I enjoyed my Riesling, only it was WAY beyond too late because we had already finished our drinks and entree's. Unacceptable. She was a complete disappointment and downer to to what should have easily been a 5 star experience. I'll give her somewhat of a pass, as given her lathargic attitude and lack of enthusiasm, she was probably still hung over for New Year's Eve the night before...or should I say earlier in the wee hours of that same morning?  Wish we had that talk glass of water serving the table of six across from our booth. He was fantastic and clearly has customer service down packed!

Came here for NYE dinner 2013; This was our second go-round from the previous NYE. Strip House was a good choice because it is centrally located on the strip where all the NYE action goes down.  The service was absolutely awesome. They waited on us hand and food. Loved the complimentary bread basket. That bad boy is as endless as you want it to be. Unfortunately, I think I ate one too many pretzel rolls. Oh well...the heck with it! The jury is still out on the food. The bone in rib-eye was ok. There are definitely much better renditions in Vegas, which is steak house mania. Personally, I think N9NE and even THE Steak House in Circus Circus are better. Surprisingly, the lobster bisque was bland. This was disheartening to me as I love a good lobster bisque. We also order the Caesar salad which was delicious.   Unfortunately, something we at here left us with a bad case of food poisoning. We know because this was the ONLY thing we ate all day. No bueno.  Sorry Strip House, you're officially off my Vegas "A" list. For now, N9NE steals the show. We'll have to see if Crafsteak or STRIPSTEAK take the crown.

Every girl should experience a massage and/or facial at Canyon Ranch Spa or Qua (Caesars Palace)  The visit - During my most recent visit to sin city, I experienced a spa facial at Canyon Ranch in the Venetian.  Absolutely wonderful!  This is the ultimate pampering experience, and my skin always looks and feels so rejuvenated.    The service -  My esthetician was extremely well versed in her craft.  Having super sensitive skin, I really appreciated this.   Yes, Canyon Ranch does attempt to sell you product, but what spa doesn't?  An esthetician would not be doing your skin justice by neglecting to give you proper skin care recommendations.  Other amenities - Canyon Ranch has an extremely nice fitness facility.  There is ample cardio and weight training equipment to burn those calories.  The steam room was also quite wonderful.  Canyon Ranch is a bit pricey, but you will find this to be the case at other surrounding spa's as well...$150ish for a massage or facial is usually the going rate.  Tip - As about weekday specials.  Many spas offer facials and massages at almost 50% less than what they would be on weekends.

My two girlfriends and I were feeling spontaneous, so we gased up the gully and took a 4 hour drive to Vegas. Thankfully my girlfriend has a timeshare at the Tahiti Village, and they were able to accommodate our whimsical request to check in at 1:00 AM on a Friday morning. The one bedroom was very comfortable and thoughtfully decorated; much like the rest of the timeshare, with Tahitian flavor and modern flare. We enjoyed the complimentary shuttle that ran us back and forth to the strip. Drop off points were New York New York and Mirage. Loved the fact that the shuttle runs until 1:00 AM. The pool here is also pretty spectacular. It's very spacious and wonderfully laid out. Plenty of room for folks to spread out; there's even a bar for cool drinks. And the poolside DJ - nice touch!

The BEST filet mignon EVER!   This is it folks! When you're looking for a filet that is so good it speaks to your soul look no further - get it at Joe's. I generally do not order filet mignon because they always seem to lack flavor. Delmonico's is a prime example of an over priced bland filet. Thank God for Joe's that a sista can finally enjoy a figure friendly cut of steak that is out of this world. I ordered the lunch special and for $21.99 here's whatcha girl got:   Petite Filet - Awesome!   Jenny's Potatoes - Not the greatest. I would never order this again. The hashed brown potatoes didn't look any better. They looked like an over-sized overcooked baked potato.   Grilled Tomato - Phenomenal. Never had anything like this I'm my life. One slice of a grilled tomato covered with cream of spinach and then layered with baked cheese...don't knock it til you try it.   Two Crab Claws - My awesome waiter threw these in for free to ensure that I at least experienced the famous crab claws. He was honest about stating they were not in season. They were a bit frozen, but still okay. I was glad I didn't order them as my main course.   Key Lime Pie - The Bomb! The lunch special actually came with banana cream pie...once again my waiter went over and beyond to hook me up.   The service here is the BEST. Everyone is there to ensure you leave extremely happy. My server went as far as to squeeze lemon juice over my hands prior to handing me a hot towel...OMG!!!   Overall, this place was outstanding!. I would highly recommend.

Planet Hollywood Rocks !   It's Classy, Chic, Trendy...I love it all. Planet Hollywood may not have the best rooms or hotel experience in Vegas, but this is one of my favorite places to shop.   The Mag Mile at Planet Hollywood offers a shopping experience for everyone to enjoy. They offer your standard Bath and Body Works, Victoria Secret, Loccitane, Bebe, BCBG, Gap, Sephora, H&M, and Marciano variety. I also love to visit the Wild Pair, Bakers, Betsy Johnson, and Bettie Page...I know, I have very eclectic, somewhat abstract taste in fashion. Don't care for trends - like my own style.   If you are into couture fashions then PH wouldn't necessarily be for you. I would stick to Bellagio, Forum Shops at Caesars, or The Wynn.   This is a must visit while in Vegas!

Stayed here while on business.  I had a magnificent room on the 32nd floor with a view of both pools, the Bellagio Fountain, and the strip. Awesome.  Can't say I was overly impressed with the room. The room had poor lighting and semi loud plumbing, but it was very spacious, and contemporary.  However, as a frequent traveler, I have experienced much nicer.    I do love the convenience of having the Miracle Mile shopping mall just outside of the casino. Love splurging in French Connection, Marciano, BCBG, Bettie Page (for my eclectic side), Benetton, Urban Outfitters, White House Black Market, and Bakers or Wild Pair when they have a decent looking shoe that doesn't lack in quality or craftsmanship. PH is one of my must stops for shopping because it houses the Coffee Bean, one of my favorite chain coffee shops. While I enjoy shopping at PH, I expected more in terms of the rooms. The rates are usually fantastic, but I would rather pay a bit more for luxury. In that regard, I will likely stick with the Venetian/Palazzo, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan (because I'm a Marriott elite snob, lol), or the Aria.   3 Stars for the room 4 stars for the Miracle Mile Shops and great room rates

This is a great place to grab breakfast or lunch in a casual atmosphere. They offer a very comfortable dining experience with flat screen tv's throughout. We came for a pre-flight breakfast on a Monday. The prices here are very reasonable. In addition to their regular menu, they offer several daily specials. A few of the specials they offered on this particular Monday morning were: Steak & Eggs for $6.99, all you can eat pancakes for $3.99, and bottomless coffee for $3.99. My party went with the steak & eggs special, biscuits and gravy, and bottomless coffee. Everything was great. The only downside is that the service was slooooow.

Whenever I locate a Grand Lux Cafe, I make it a point to dine there.  So far, I have dined at the Grand Lux Cafe inside the Palazzo and Venetian Las Vegas as well as in the Beverly Center (CA).   For the first time I was really disappointed in the food.  The mashed potatoes that came with my entree were extremely cold. They tasted as if they were left over from the previous day.   My server, although pretty nice, never came back to check on me, so I was stuck with a non-satisfactory meal.   I was not a happy camper.  Given my experiences at other Grand Lux Cafe's,  I would definitely give them another chance.   I will just toss it up to a bad day.

Terrible service!   Cold Mahi Mahi Alexander. Cold Andouille Sausage Gumbo. Cold hard bread. Server Renee B had zero personality, wasn't helpful, didn't bring silver wear until well after the meals were delivered. Never came back to check in us. If she did she would have learned that our food was cold and we didn't have silverware. I understand the place is super busy, but none of the other servers seemed to have a problem checking on their tables. I'm sorry, but there is just no excuse for bad customer service.  And what kind of manager doesn't acknowledge when a mistake by his staff or kitchen has been made? Not even an apology? Shame on you Philip! I came from Cali to patronize your establishment and this is how you treat your customers? Not sure I'd return.

My $6.00 iced soy latte was bomb! It's coffee the way it should be; not that fake foo foo stuff we pay for at places that don't really profess to know about coffee bean origins. Here at Cartel you see the coffee beans in action. Love the ambiance at this place; it's a "see & be seen" type of vibe, so grab your prescription glasses, MacBook, iPhone and get ready for some of the best coffee you've ever had. Order a pour over which is made with one of the daily coffee varietals of your choice for a true taste of how this place gets down. They do coffee right. Reminds me of one of my favorite spots in Cali - Portola Coffee Lab inside the OC Mix - I love this place!

I've Been to Apple stores all over the world and this store has the absolute BEST customer service. So many smiling friendly faces. I was even able to walk in and obtain service for my iPhone 4S - unbelievable and absolutely unheard of for the Cali stores back home that I frequent. This Town Square location rocks!

The BF did some research on Cajun/Creole restaurants in Vegas before we headed there again for the second time this month. I was a bit skeptical when he asked me what I thought about trying the Rhythm Kitchen - probably because there were only 2 Yelp reviews and neither of gave me warm fuzzies about the food. Since Creole/Cajun food is the BF's favorite and we're always looking for new restaurants to try, we thought we would give the place a try. On 7/24, we took a drive down Decatur to the Rhythm Kitchen for lunch. The restaurant is a wonderful modern establishment that unfortunately sits all by itself in a deserted area. When we arrived at the restaurant my first instinct was to turn around and leave. The parking lot was pretty empty and it seemed like a ghost town. That coupled with the fact that the place had somewhat of a foul odor. I should have followed my instinct and left. For starters, they give you a lunch menu, but beware because most if not all the prices are exactly the same as those on the dinner menu. And you pay dinner prices for lunch size portions. Are you kidding me! Here's the scoop on what the BF and I ordered:   Jambalaya - Spicy but lacked that authentic Cajun seasoning and flavor. It was also a bit too soupy. Not bad, but I've had much better.   Shrimp and Catfish Po Boy - Large pieces of shrimp and cornmeal battered fish. Just ok. Again, it seemed to be lacking something. A bit bland for my taste.   Red Beans and Rice - Disgusting. Truthfully, the Popeyes Chicken across the street tastes much better.   Cajun Rice - Not sure why they opted to switch the andouille sausage for spicy sausage (as indicated by the waiter), but I didn't care for this side dish. Like the red beans and rice, the Cajun rice had zero flavor.   Sweet Tea - I was really excited to see that they offered this southern delicacy. However, I was very disappointed. How can you serve "sweet tea" when the tea is not sweet???   On the upside, they serve you delicious hush puppies with honey butter and they will keep them coming. Just be sure to finish up before 3:00 PM because they will hover over you and attempt to rush you out so they can close up shop early. Bad customer service, especially for a new establishment. Overall, however, I would not recommend this place. There are better places both on and off the strip.

This is an intimate bar nestled inside the lovely Arizona Biltmore Hotel. I came here with a group of friends to enjoy a drink for my girlfriend's birthday. We were  told that this is the bar where Angela Bassett and Wesley Snipes shared an intimate bar conversation and Lord knows what else.  Three drinks cost us $47 Before tip.

Drive to this location because the one on Decatur closed at 8 PM on Sat. I walked in for the first time confused and overwhelmed. Thankfully, I had read the Yelp reviews, so I was armed with info on what to get. There was a lady there who proudly professed her status as a "regular" there, so her tips were also helpful. My order? A small pastrami sandwich ($7.79), regular fries ($2.29 and change), and a medium strawberry lemonade $3.39). They aren't jokin when they say this is a one man show making everything fresh to order. I waited like 20-30 minutes for my to go order. Was it worth it??? It was ok. Honestly, this was not the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had, but it hit the spot.

The customer service here is awesome. I visited this location to purchase a logo clutch to match both my black and tan pair of Calista boots. They didn't waste any time showing me the 5 ways I can wear the purse. Freakin awesome!!!

We were headed to the Aria Cafe for brunch/lunch, but the line was ridiculously long and we weren't feelin the wait, so, we headed back out of the Aria and into Crystals; the ginormous bloody marry peaked my partner's interest, so, in we went.  It was closer to lunch, but I was in the mood for breakfast, so, I went with the challah French toast. It was delicious! My partner ordered the chicken fried steak and loved it. Prices were about what we expect for strip eating. We plan for it, so, it's all good. We left very satisfied. That was a plus.  Service was spectacular. Ask for Melissa, she is absolutely phenomenal-provides the best service in Vegas!

I'm in town often for business, so I'm always looking for the best eats off the strip. So, as usual, Yelp led me to the best. I'll admit, when I walked in I was expecting to see a menu or listing of items on the wall, or even some Komex signage inside, but instead I was stuck standing at the counter looking stupid. I wondered if I was even in the right place. It is a little hole in the wall. Nobody asked if I needed help or wanted to order. Finally, after having stood at the counter for some time I asked for a menu. Everything sounded good.  I couldn't decide on the bulgogi tacos or burrito. Naturally, I went with BOTH. And, of course I couldn't leave without the chips and guacamole. The chips were the bomb! Korean BBQ AND Mexican? Freakin GENIUS!!! Komex please make your way to San Diego!  Everything was SO good. This is definitely one of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas.

It's flashy, glitzy, always open for "business", and everybody loves it! Vegas will always be that place that everybody gets excited about, young or old, tall or short, bald or weaved...yessir, we all come together for one common goal - having the time of our life in the city that NEVER sleeps. It's Vegas baby!

We were staying in the Cosmo and wanted a late night bite. I had this place bookmarked for quite some time, so, off we went. I odered the Rising Sun and a shake. The rising sun is an Asian fusion burger made of kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado; a lot goin on - I wasn't impressed. The shake was delicious.  I like the fact that they offer late night bites. However, there are just too many other great burger places to choose from. Holsteins falls flat. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing; it came highly recommended by our server. Regardless, I don't need to spend another $18 on a burger here only to be disappointed and unfulfilled again. I probably won't return.

I'm still visualizing this awesome show as I write this review. It is one of the best Cirque De Soleil's I've seen in Vegas. I would definitely go and see it again in a heartbeat! And, how the heck did they manage to do a silhouette of Michael Jackson? That blew me away.   I agree with other reviews in that this is not your typical Cirque show in Vegas; mainly because there are a lot less acrobatics. This show is heavier on dancing and tribute theatricals. Me personally, I would've appreciated more acrobatics, but I still enjoyed the show.  Go see it for yourself. If you're a true Michael Jackson fan then you'll love it. If you think you'll have heartburn over $300+ tickets for two and a minimal amount of the usual Cirque acrobatics, then give it a second thought.

I was excited to see a Steak & Shake I'm AZ; the first time I tried this place was in Orlando. I've since seen them in Ft Lauderdale and Miami, but never on the West Cosst until today. Unfortunately, everything from beginning to end was a huge disappointment. I should note that the service was great, however, aside from the service this location needs lots of work. Every table was disgusting. There was no attempt to clean the filthy tables until o asked of one could be cleaned for me. The excuse I was given was that they'd been hit by a large lunch crowd; that's fine, except it was now 3pm. The food was under seasoned and boring. I expected so much more.  I will not return.

The Burgers here are amazing! I've been a couple of times now and the food is consistently good. There is no shortage of burger places in Vegas - Gordon Ramsey BurGR, Holsteins, Umami, Bachi, Strip Burger...the list goes on. At the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference. For me, I love a good burger at Guy Fieri's Kitchen & Bar. And, for the ultimate hangover cure - order the Bloody Mary.   The service at the bar is friendly, fast, and super attentive; don't bother sitting in the main dining room - the servers don't seem as friendly and they don't move as fast. One server had a stick up his who ha because we were seated in his section. We promptly got up and went to the bar instead. Glad we did - the service was SO much better.  I'll remain a loyal customer.

Cain Velasquez on sourdough - Now that's what I'm talkin about! It's the real deal pastrami sandwich with bacon, swiss and Ike's special garlic aioli sauce. These sammy's are not for wimps! It's for foodies like myself who appreciate food, all kinds of food...and lots of it. I ordered my Cain Velasquez with avocado - cause I'm from Cali and that's just how we roll; don't sleep on these sandwiches folks; they're pretty amazing! I was in Heaven because they sell Zapp's potato chips, Key Lime and Cream Soda. Took me back to all those vacations in Nawlins when I'd pig out on catfish & shrimp po-boys and Zapp's. Made me feel right at home.   Not sure how I paid $18 for a Sammy & some chips...but the sandwiches must be made with crack...so, I'll be back tomorrow for the Menage A Trois (BBQ Sauce, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss) or Adam Richman (Avocado, Fried Chicken, Ham, Pesto, Real Honey, Swiss).  These are some of the best sandwiches ever! I just wish we had Ike's in San Diego:(
