My husband and I LOVE this place.  The first time we went a friend had recommended this place to me, and I decided to make a reservation on OpenTable and we got in with no problems.  On the outside this does not look like much, and at first it throws you off that you have to walk to the kitchen to get to the dining area.  The staff is very friendly and knows the menu very well.  We order the Seafood Sampler and it is delicious.  Some steakhouses are hit and miss and this one is a hit over and over.    It is never a disappointment.  The Australian Lobster Tail and the Filet Mignon are the best that I have ever had!

I have been taking my dog (pom-mix) to this location since I got him and I would not go anywhere else!  The groomers always do a great job of taking care of my dog.  They used to call and remind me about appointments that have been made in advanced but have since stopped.  If you use your Petco Pals card earn points and even a free hair cut.

This is just your average Boba House.  The worker didnt seem to know what Boba really was either.  She offered for us to try the new Strawberry Dragon Fruit but we had to buy it instead of sample it.  The worker also told us that it was really good so we bought a small and it was horrible, no real flavor except for the pieces of strawberries and kiwis placed on top.   My husband ordered Taro Milk Tea and I ordered Thai Milk Tea..  Nothing special have definatly had better and was expecting better.  What I did like is that the Boba has a plastic covering so that you cannot spill it.  I would rather spend my money at Lee Lee's right next door.
