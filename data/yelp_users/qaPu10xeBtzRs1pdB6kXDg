Hands down the best coffee spot in Arizona (and I've been to plenty). After having Matador for the first time, I have been completely hooked and refuse to go to any other coffee shop! The staff is super friendly and they make me feel special by knowing my order when I walk in :) Everyone must try their White Mocha Raspberry Iced Latte! Perfection!

Octopus was great, chopped salad is a must, and their manhattan is amazing.

first of all, if there was a rating option to give no stars, i would choose that option. In other words, worst gym i have ever signed up for IN MY LIFE!!!! my sister and i signed up for 6 months training membership & gym membership .. and like a month later they told us we didn't have a gym membership & we needed to buy one at that point i was already paying $100 for 4 training sessions per month. so obviously i'm going to say "no you suck." they also made me pay first and last months bill, which i did, then i look at my bill and they STILL charged my for my last month. dumbest and most unprofessional gym EVER. ps: their trainers suck. they actually set you up with their head trainer for your "first free personal training session" and he literally makes you feel like you are out of shape then once you actually sign up they give you their sucky trainers.   Fitness 1 is the worst. you have been warned.
