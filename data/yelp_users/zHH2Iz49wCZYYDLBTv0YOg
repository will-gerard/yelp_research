I was so proud of myself for finally getting around to cashing in the $5 coupon I received for running the 10K Turkey Trot last Thanksgiving, which Mi Amigo's sponsors, and I gotta tell ya, I really, really wish I hadn't. Bad food, worse service. The waitress was hot, though. Rude, but hot.  I ordered the Shrimp & Scallop Enchiladas, which basically consisted of a couple stale tortillas covered with runny cheese, topped off with half a dozen miniature shrimps and scallops. Oh, and a small pile of cold beans and white (white, really?) rice. My date actually grimaced when they brought out the food - grimaced! - and said, "You're not really going to eat that, are you?"  We were in a drinking mood and surely would have spent good money doing it, but after she brought the food, we never saw the hot waitress again - Ever! - and I actually had to get up and ask another, much less attractive waitress for the bill.  Here's the best part - they took my $5 coupon but didn't apply it to the bill. A-holes.

Did the general admission pass at the Arizona Science Center + the Black Holes show at Dorrance Planetarium with my little brother earlier this afternoon. General admission exhibitions were pretty neat - four floors filled with interactive learning exercises for kids, although I must admit I did learn a few things myself. He's almost 8 and he enjoyed maybe 60-70% of them. Some weren't working, and the rest were 'kind of lame' (for younger kids).  The black hole show in the planetarium was very cool. First half was basically a documentary narrated by John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek) with really interesting facts and amazing graphics. Second half was hosted by one of the local astronomers - very funny guy - who basically broke down the night sky and all the constellations for us, and threw in quite a few fascinating myths and legends of various cultures. Worth checking out.  Oh, also learned a new word I've just got to share: "spaghettification". Technically, it describes how you would be stretched like spaghetti should you ever find yourself passing within a black hole's event horizon (not recommended). But I've been secretly brainstorming other uses for it all day.

They're the oldest, largest and most effective youth mentoring organization in the United States. Research has shown that positive relationships between "Littles" and their "Bigs" have a direct and measurable impact on children's lives. They are more confident in school, better able to get along with their families and peers, and less likely to begin using alcohol and drugs.  One of the reasons this program works so well is the dedication of the matchmakers. Their extensive interview and screening process ensures the best matches possible, which are based on similar backgrounds, interests and hobbies.   What I've discovered during my time as a Big is that I get as much out of our relationship as my Little. He's an awesome kid that just needs a male role model in his life, and I am proud to be the one to be able to provide it. We've bowled, gone to the Arizona Science Center, the planetarium, watched movies, sometimes we just hang out and play video games.  The commitment they ask for is just a few hours two to four times a month, for a minimum of 6 months. Of course the longer the better - many matches remain friends for life.  Ok, now I'm going to wrap up by quoting Whitney Houston in a Yelp review (which a fellow Yelper bet me a Cornish Pasty I'd never be able to find a justifiable reason for doing so)... "I believe the children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside." Ha! I'll take that Eggplant Parmesan Pasty now, thanks.

As I'm leaving work this afternoon I say, "Shit" when I remember have to buy dog food on my way home. Been putting it off for a few days now, but when I fed her this morning, that was it, last cup. So my curious co-worker says, "What?" So I tell her, "Gotta go to Costco." And she says, "Why shit? That's fun." And I realize, my co-worker is as wise as she is curious. Because it is fun. I love going to Costco. Where else can you buy cans of peanut butter that are larger than your head, twelve-packs of relish and blocks of cheese that will you last you the rest of your life? You can't beat the prices or the ever changing selection. But the best part? The samples (weekends, mostly). Some Saturdays, that's my lunch - walking from free sample station to free sample station. They've got all kinds of stuff: cookies, crackers, vitamin water, energy bars, you name it. Enough to fill you up, fo' shizzle! Hey - I finally worked "fo' shizzle" into one of my reviews. Sweet.

I dig this place. It's the closest thing to a sure thing in the area for me as far as Mexican food is concerned. The shrimp fajitas rock, as do the fish tacos, which are made with grilled pacific Hawaiian Ono - I think they come with corn tortillas, but they'll gladly trade those out for flour if you ask nice. They also come with a super tasty chipotle cream dipping sauce, but not enough in my opinion. Ask for more, they'll bring it. For vegetarians I recommend the mushroom enchiladas blancas or the spinach enchiladas, both of which are equally delicious - and rich. Bring the Lactaid if you're lactose intolerant. Oh, and apparently they've got a killer lunch menu - not sure how I've been going there for years and didn't know that. Oh, well, maybe it's because I usually go for dinner. Margarita ordering tip: go for broke. The base margarita blows. Yeah, it's way cheaper, but it tastes like you're drinking pure sweet & sour mix. Order their top shelf, whatever it is, I don't remember, think I had one too many last time I was there.

So my iPhone went haywire this afternoon. The little 'slide to unlock' button - it wouldn't slide. Calls and texts were coming in, but I couldn't get to 'em. Now, I'm not saying I dropped it shortly before it went haywire - because that might have voided the warranty, and besides, it could have gone haywire without being dropped - but I'm not saying I didn't either, if you know what I mean.   Well, since I couldn't exactly call for help, I went online and made an appointment for the genius bar. This was around 3pm, I guess. Earliest appointment was for 7:20. I showed up at 7:10, checked in, got called at 7:15. Walked out of the the store with a brand new iPhone at 7:25. A brand new iPhone in 15 minutes! So all those little nicks and scratches that have been piling up for the last year (maybe from being dropped, maybe not) - gone. That pocket lint I've been trying like hell to get out of the little speaker holes - gone.  This isn't the first time I've been to the genius bar at an Apple Store - I've had iPod and MacBook issues as well over the years - and every time, every single time, it's the same experience, whatever the store. The employees are friendly and courteous - the guy tonight - Matt, introduced himself, shook my hand, told me he'd be solving my problem tonight. And he did - quickly and efficiently. Thanks, bro.

Meh. Went a couple times too, just to be sure. Primarily due to the better Yelp reviews preceding this one. But now I'm sure. The food's not bad, but it's not that good, either - and overpriced for what it is, which is pretty standard breakfast fare. Service was dismal both trips. Barely got greeted, then long waits between waitress visits before she disappeared completely. I like the d√©cor - it's a neat little place with cool artwork, but it's not enough to make up for the service (or lack thereof) and the overpriced food. Until I find a better place in my hood I'll stick to Acacia Cafe, which is just the opposite really - no atmosphere, but better food at a better price and friendly service - which are more important in my book. Oh, and what's with the charge for splitting a meal? My date and I often share a dish - we would have been happy to eat off the same plate, but we weren't even given the option, just charged 2 bucks for somebody to cut our omelet in half. WTF?

Yum.  Thai Lahna has been on my list for a while thanks to Yelp, and now that I finally got around to it, I wish I hadn't waited so long to check it out. It's a cute little place tucked away in a strip mall. After reading the previous Yelp reviews, my date and I mentally prepared ourselves for good food but perhaps not the greatest of service. So we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly and attentive staff. Especially me, especially when our waitress got my back in front of my date...   She said, "How spicy?" and I asked her which was hotter - Medium or Mild, which my date found wildly amusing. Because I thought every place is a little different, right? Sometimes Mild is hotter, sometimes Medium is hotter? No, apparently not, according to my date. Apparently Mild is always hotter than Medium no matter where you go, and I'm an F'n spicetard. But our valiant waitress, bless her heart, jumped right to my defense, saying no, I was no spicetard, people asked her that all the time. All the time. Now, I don't know if that's true or not, but I appreciated her saying it just the same.  The menu is loaded with vegetarian options, and they'll replace meat with tofu for the ones that aren't (still might want to check sauce ingredients). Shared the sweet and sour tofu and a shrimp dish (can't remember the name) and both were equally delicious. The Thai iced tea was tasty, too - sweet, but not too sweet.

So my dog peed on my bed. I'm not talking about a little pee here, I'm talking about a flood of Biblical proportions. Bitch. Of course I tried cleaning it, following the advice of numerous individuals, pouring, scrubbing and patting with various chemical agents, but nothing worked. Got the stain out, sure, but I could still smell it.  Well, I checked out a few other places on my quest for a new mattress before ending up at Bedmart. Should've just come here first. They've got a wide selection (a few actual beds, but mattresses mostly), excellent deals (all their Sealy products are on sale right now - got $200 off the one I bought), free next day delivery (during which they'll take your old mattress away), and super friendly customer service. But best of all, they sell a waterproof mattress protector (made out of cotton so it breathes) large enough to fit over oversized pillow-top mattresses up to 20 inches wide, with a 10 year guarantee. Nice.

Decent food, but bad service. Our waitress must have had an egg roll up her butt or something that was distracting her. In all my years of dining I don't think I've ever had a server come to the table, ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink, then walk away. Seriously - she got my friend's drink order and walked away! WTF? But then, get this, she did it again, when she came back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered my drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my glass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I started looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the restaurant with it, no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent, like I said, nothing special, but edible, but with that kind of service, I ain't going back.

Love this place. Yeah, the produce rocks, but I go for the bread, the sinfully delicious fresh baked bread - Cinnamon, Cherry, Cranberry Orange, Mandarin Orange, Almond Poppyseed, Blueberry, Marble Loaf, Apple... Their sliced bread rocks too, of course - honey wheat, sourdough, garlic cheese... I didn't care for the Jalapeno Cheddar (not nearly enough cheddar), but otherwise... mmmm! Ask for their Frequent Bread Buyer Card and get a free loaf when it's full. Lots of sweet treats as well - crumb cake, sugar cookies, macaroons, even peanut brittle. Definitely worth checking out.

So after a week of serious delusions of grandeur, I decided to try to recreate my best game ever (291!) at AMF Christown last week (http://www.yelp.com/biz/amf-christown-lanes-phoenix#hrid:dC0EVBb8uHY_abASYEe5JA), and I was sorely disappointed. Dragged a buddy of mine along, and our combined scores were still less my previous miracle. Yeah, I suck. Not sure what happened last time.  But I suppose I should mention the bowling alley. Meh. After complaining about the lack of balls with big enough holes at AMF Christown, I couldn't even find one here and had to use a heavier ball than I'm used to. My buddy suggested I might be a pussy and should be using a heavier ball to begin with, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that premise. "Just throwing it out there," he said. Jerk. Just kidding - you know I love ya, dude.  Service was so-so, lanes were ok, seats were uncomfortable, prices were average. Crappy video game selection. Horrible food. I know, I know - it's a bowling alley, what do I expect? But my buddy got the nachos, which was basically a bowl of stale Tostitos and two tiny little cups of lukewarm melted Velveeta-type cheese, not even enough for half the chips.  It's an okay place, but the lack of a decent ball selection is a pretty big strike in my book. No pun intended. Seriously, I tried to come up with a different word, but that's all I got.

Bad food, worse service.  Waitress took our drink orders, and then twenty minutes later the manager came by to tell us our waitress got busy with another table and he would take our drink orders. Ten minutes later the original waitress came back to get our drink orders. Ummmm.... hello? Finally got our magaritas, which were weak as hell and way too sweet and sour.  And everything was slimy. I'm not OCD or anything but I felt the need to get up and wash my hands after flipping through the menu. And after touching the salt and pepper shakers. And after moving the itty bitty little chip basket from one side of the table to the other.  Ordered an appetizer - the Farmer's Market Quesadilla. Plate was hot but the cheese was cold. Vegetables were slimy. Tortilla was burnt. And they didn't bring us any napkins or silverware. We waited what we thought was an acceptable amount of time for someone to stop by and when nobody did I actually got up, walked across the restaurant to the hostess stand where there was a box and got them myself.

I've never actually eaten in the restaurant - Swaddee is one of those places I used to pick up and take home when I lived in Chandler. So, first their take-out process: they've never botched an order, food has been ready within the time frame given each and every time, and I'm almost always in and out in a flash. The food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they've all been equally delicious. Since I've never been inside for more than a few minutes, I can't really vouch for the atmosphere or the service, but I stand by the food. A little pricier, perhaps, than the Thai Basil down the street, but totally worth it.

As a general rule, I steer clear of chain restaurants across from shopping malls, but I must admit, this place has got some seriously delicious seafood. I recommend the Pescado Guerrero - a wood-grilled tender mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced avocado in a white wine sauce. Yes, I totally stole that description from their website, although I did remove the word 'delicious', since I'd already used it in the previous sentence. Thought it might sound a little too repetitive if I left it in, two deliciouses so close together. Not that this dish doesn't deserve 'em both, it's just that I'm not one to repeat things unnecessarily. Omit needless words, that's what Strunk & White would say. Sharp guys. Not big Yelpers, from what I understand, but still good advice nevertheless... Although, used correctly, repetition can be an excellent rhetorical strategy for producing emphasis, clarity, amplification, even emotional effect. I guess Joe Walsh was right, there are two side to every story.  Oh, and I'd stay away from the Fundido del Mar appetizer. A little too much fondue and not enough shrimp & scallops.

Ate pizza and played video games at Peter Piper Pizza with my lil bro Saturday afternoon as part of a larger pizza party, and we had a blast. No, the pizza ain't great, kind of tastes like a greasy sponge, but the kids don't notice - and really that's why you're there anyway. I say greasy sponge, but you know I had at least three or four slices. Even bad pizza is good pizza.  This location definitely felt a little cleaner than some of the others around the valley.  The game selection was decent, though still doesn't compare to an actual arcade - they had Star Wars Trilogy, Area 51, a boxing simulation, air hockey, at least three different sets of racing games that two people can play together, a bunch of the ones where you just drop your token in and that's it (aim for the back of the dump truck, aim for the railroad bridge, etc) - some of which are actually a little addicting. And Skee Ball, of course. God, I don't know what it is that makes Skee Ball so addictive - my lil bro and me, we must have dropped tokens into that game for over an hour. He walked away with hundreds of tickets, which he redeemed for cool stuff - a slinky, and some playing cards. Oh, and vampire teeth. Can't go to Peter Piper Pizza and leave without redeeming your tickets for vampire teeth.

This is that place next to the REI off of Southern Avenue. No real ambiance or service to speak of - it's just a little strip mall burrito joint.  I ordered the Devil's Shrimp burrito or burro or something, I don't know. I don't guess I stopped to think about what meaning exactly the word 'devil' might carry in the name, but I found out - it means HOT. Like hotter than pepper spray hot. And yes, unfortunately for me, I do know what pepper spray tastes like - I had this friend in college back in Austin, and one drunken night his crazy little brother Michael slipped me a shrimp that he'd soaked in pepper spray. Lemme tell ya, that was pretty F'in hot, but not even close to the devil shrimp at Taco Nazo. I'll be back, but only to take Michael there when he comes to visit next month. Beware the devil's shrimp.

Wow. I thought I'd been to a Gameworks before, but this isn't the place I remember. Puts Dave & Busters to shame. Shame, brother. Hung out for a couple hours there this afternoon with my lil bro and man, we had a blast. Price-wise you can't beat the 2 hour unlimited play for $15 we hit. Don't think that's available all the time, but it was today. Score.  Service was actually really good too - what kind of service do you really need at an arcade? Well, not having been in one quite like this, it was kind of nice to have someone patiently explain the swipe card system (no pockets full of quarters anymore), not to mention the layout of the place (which is huge - two floors!).   The selection's incredible - everything from your typical racing games, shooting games and fighting games to basketball and skee ball and air hockey - there's even stuff I've never seen before, like a Karoake booth and jumping games (?) and roller coaster simulators. And as one reviewer mentioned, there are several that even require a seatbelt. A seatbelt. Sweet.

I've been a loyal R.E.I. customer for years. I've shopped at several different stores across the country and consistently had the same positive experience. They've got the highest quality gear for hiking / biking / camping / rock climbing and more. They've got knowledgeable and helpful employees. They've got customer friendly policies. And yes, they've also got higher prices - but here you actually get what you pay for. Last but not least, they've got a sweet membership program, which for a one-time fee (currently $20) gets you special offers, rental discounts and an annual dividend equal to 10% of your purchases.

I've never really been a coffee house kind of guy, but then I'd never been to Inside the Bungalow before yesterday, when I found myself in Mesa with some time to kill. What a seriously cool place. It's an old house - a really big old house - with lots of little private corners to sit and eat/drink, chat, read, compute (apparently they got free wi-fi, but I didn't have my laptop with me), just chill, whatever. If I lived a little closer, I would totally hang out here. They've also got a giant patio with a fountain out front - a little hot in the afternoon this time of year, but only for another month or so..

Ahhhh.... Now here's a reasonably priced used book store with a wide selection. Many thanks to Alicia for the recommendation. Could definitely have spent more time and money here but somehow managed to pull  myself away with a few choice Joyce Carol Oates short story collections I haven't been able to find at Bookman's or Half Price Books. I know, I know, just order them online, right - but where's the fun in that? I need the thrill of the hunt! Friendly & knowledgeable staff, wide selection, good location... what else can you ask for?

So I've been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. That's it, Ra - you've lost another customer.

Most people I know absolutely loathe car dealerships and would never even consider taking their car in for service, and for the most part I agree with them - I've had plenty of bad experiences over the years. But never at the Earnhardt on Baseline. Ok, maybe once or twice they took a little longer than they initially estimated - but with the number of times I've been in over the last 6 years, it's a small percentage, and I'll forgive them.   Your Service Manager definitely makes the difference. I totally trust my guy - when I brought my Wrangler in to get bigger tires, he told me he'd do it, but I'd get a much better deal if I went somewhere else (even made a few suggestions as to where). He's done that a couple of times, actually. So he may not get my business every time, but I'll keep coming back.  Cool Stuff: -Easy early morning drop-off. Best way to get to the top of the list is to drop off your vehicle before they open. The night guard's got envelopes you can fill out and drop your keys in. -Free shuttle. They'll take you home and pick you up - on their schedule, but still - it'll come in handy if you don't have a ride of your own.

This place is gone, man. Literally leveled. Apparently incorporated into Darner Chrysler Jeep out in Mesa. Not quite sure what the deal is with the name - they still answered "Earnhardt" when I called the old number. Sure wish they'd mentioned there was a new location when I called in to make my appointment, but I'll save that story - and a one star rating - for my review of the Darner dealership. The Earnhardt guys on Baseline were always good to me and my Jeep, and I don't want to tarnish a good memory.

Yes, it's a chain. But it's a Texas chain that opened it's first restaurant on 6th Street in Austin. That's street cred in my book. I've been to all their Austin locations, but now frequent the one off Mill Avenue in Tempe. Went for lunch just this afternoon as a matter of fact, and it always amazes me how I forget how good the food is between visits, even the complimentary corn bread. Today I ordered the Blackened Catfish Tacos with black beans and rice. Yum. I also recommend the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas and Baked Seafood Enchiladas.

Love the Hut. Most sub shops have one token veggie sub, but not the Hut. They've got at least 7 different options for non-meat eaters, and they are all original and incredibly delicious. Best veggie subs: Humbolt, Griefo, Silver Haze, and my personal favorite, the Magic Mushroom: portabella mushrooms marinated in teriyaki sauce, topped with green peppers, pineapple & pepper jack cheese... Yum!  Yeah, it's got the whole doobie-licious theme going, and yeah, it's pretty hilarious, but it's the sandwiches that keep me coming back. And the rice krispie treats. Oh, and the hemp brownies. Can't forget about the brownies.  Service can be a little slow when they're busy, but it's so worth the wait.

I can't believe I haven't already written a review of this place yet - it's one of my favorites. I've been coming here for years. I've sampled pretty much all their veggie options, and I loved every single one of them. Okay, maybe every single one. Not the the Curried Spinach Potato Pizza. I don't know, it just didn't work for me. But the rest I loved. My favorites: Pesto Pizza, Tuna Melt, Veggie Garden Wrap, Black Bean Burger, Veggie Burger, Macro Platter... well, I'll stop there.  It's true, service can be a little slow when they're busy, but the staff is  always friendly. And I love the ever changing local artwork that covers the walls.

Harlow's, you bad girl, you. I can taste your huevos rancheros from here... Your fluffy eggs, your sassy salsa, your crispy potatoes. All so scrumptious. Oh, what a temptress you are. A deliciously evil temptress. Leave me alone - I'm working. Well, working/yelping. Ok, just yelping. Whatever. I'm at work. No, I can't leave. Not now. I've got a meeting in ten minutes. No, I can't reschedule. Ok, I can. But I shouldn't. I really shouldn't... Aw, screw it - I'm on my way.

This isn't a 'just went to this place once' review - it's a 'been going to this place for years' review. Just thought I'd clarify that before getting into it. Rula Bula rocks. It was actually my first culinary experience when I moved to the valley 7 years ago. I was skeptical, as Irish pubs don't typically have a great deal to offer vegetarians (which I was at the time... now I eat fish, which opens up the menu a bit), but Rula Bula's got a few really tasty veggie options, including veggie potato skins, vegetarian shepherd's pie (that's right - never seen that anywhere else, and oh so delicious), and the four-cheese grilled sandwich. I prefer to go for lunch or dinner, as the place gets a little college kid crowded rowdy the later it gets. Yeah, I know - I'm old.

So just in case this is the first review you've read about this place, let me be the one to tell you - it's vegan. Not vegetarian (no meat, but eggs and dairy), but vegan. And several of their dishes are mock - made to resemble normal meat dishes (hot dogs, burgers, chicken, etc.). I know that right there either turns people on or off. Me, I dig it. My freezer's stocked with Boca, Morning Star, Quorn and Gardenburger products. That said, not all of their mock products work. While I love heir Spicy Buffalo Wings, Crab Puffs, Vegan Chili Fries and Mum's Meatball Po-boy, I was disappointed with the No Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich and the Vegan Hot Dogs. Haven't built up the courage to try their pizzas just yet - my previous experience with vegan cheese hasn't been all that great. But I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually, I stop by for lunch with my meat-eating friends at least once a month. But don't worry, mock isn't all they have to offer. They've also got tofu - a Spicy Peanut Tofu appetizer as well as a good variety of noodle and rice bowls.  And it's a pretty cool place - I really dig the decor, from the Volkswagen doors along an entire wall to the local art work.

Between 3 and 4 stars, depending on when you go...  Previous reviews are dead-on for weekend nights, this place fills up with douchebags - that's why we're usually long gone by then, before the college crowd and the bathroom attendants show up, and the prices go up.  Me and my work buddies have been known to head over Fridays after work for a few hours. This is the time to go. Tables are cheap, and there are plenty to choose from. Service is fast, and the drinks are cheap and strong.

How the mighty have fallen... This used to be one of my favorite places on Mill. If I'd yelped them last year they would have been 5 stars, no doubt. I ate here weekly for years, sometimes twice a week. A vegetarian haven, it was. But then... something happened. The food just tanked. New owner, I heard - but I don't know the details. Anyway, after a few bad experiences I stopped going altogether. Until a friend convinced me it might have just been growing pains and they deserved another shot. We all deserve second chances, right? Right. So I went back. Summer bows (used to be my favorite) were slimy, the tamales were dry, tamale sauce tasted like paste... And the portions weren't nearly what they used to be. So sad. How I miss the good old days.

I am ecstatic to report that In Season Deli has reclaimed its former glory..   Keep in mind, I don't know the whole story here, but apparently the previous owner, Lydia, purchased the deli back and had her Grand Re-Opening last week. Stopped by for lunch today, and man, was it delicious, just like the good old days. The tamales were so tender, the side portions were huge, I can't wait to go back, and I will - this used to be a weekly trip for me and it will be again. Welcome back, Lydia! How we missed you!

What was that freaking smell? Holy crap. Smelled like a dirty diaper wrapped in farts. Permeated the entire restaurant. Sure didn't do much to make the greasy over-priced food any more appetizing, I'll tell you that. Thought maybe it was a one-time thing, but after a quick scan of a couple previous reviews, it seems to be a recurring theme with this place. Yuck.

4 stars for what it is - cheap pizza. And cheap pizza is good pizza. And this is some of the best cheap pizza I've had around the university area. I'm down here a few times a month, whenever I don't have a full hour for lunch. The line moves pretty fast, even in the middle of the lunch rush, and there's a pretty good selection. For vegetarians, there are usually at least 3 or 4 veggie options other than just plain cheese - but not right when they open at eleven.  Eating inside can be fine or annoying depending what they're playing on the TV, which varies quite a bit, anything from Spike TV's MXC (hilarious) to Barney (extremely disturbing - seriously, have you ever sat and watched one of these shows? Some freaky-deaky shit!!) and everything in between.

For the most part, I agree with the recurring themes in the previous Bamboo Club reviews - the cool atmosphere (especially the balcony overlooking Mill Avenue), the good service, and yes, the good but not great food - but with a couple of exceptions. The Mandarin Orange Tofu is so delicious. It comes with spinach on the side, and I don't know what they do to it (is it fried?) but I can't get enough of it. It's called Mandarin Orange Chicken on the menu - Bamboo Club will substitute tofu for meat in any of their dishes (I recommend vegetarians still inquire about sauce ingredients). I also recommend the Asian Tofu with Vegetables. Quite tasty.  This is usually a lunch spot for me and a co-worker or two or three, but I've also been here with larger groups on several different occasions - much larger groups (20-30 people), and always received excellent service. In fact, the first time our "event organizer" failed to order any vegetarian dishes, the Bamboo Club staff - after apologizing (not their fault!) - responded quickly and efficiently, providing several meat-free options without question or extra charge.  The food I think deserves between 3 and 3 1/2 stars, but the good service and cool atmosphere push them up to 4.

So we were looking for something different in Tempe. Well, we found it. So far the worst Italian I've had in the valley. Look at my stats. One star reviews are rare for me. I'll usually go back at least once to give them another chance. But I'll make an exception in this case, because there's no way I'm ever goin' back to this place.  Should have known something was up when the waitress brought our drinks over talking on a cordless phone. "No," she said. "I can't talk right now. No. I'm working. I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks. Can I call you back? I'll call you back. Bye." When she put the phone down we ordered the eggplant parmesan. Big mistake. Looked and tasted like someone hid it at the bottom of the deep fryer and forgot about it. For 3 days. There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant. More like... cardboard. mmmm... cardboard parmesan. Seriously, it was gross. Sad thing was we were absolutely starving and on our way to a show so we ate it. Well, most of it. It came with a side of spaghetti, which was all right. Not as gross as the eggplant, but still not good.  Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert. Worst canoli ever. The dough was hard and stale, and the filling was strangely sour and so thick that technically I don't think it could be classified as cream. More like... gel.  Bad service, bad food. Beware.

"One of the world's most unusual stores." That's their slogan, and yeah, it's pretty accurate. The variety is mind-boggling... rugs, mirrors, paintings, handmade furniture, dishes, sculptures/statues, farm equipment, and, as other reviewers said - junk. Prices seem reasonable, I guess - kind of hard to know if $600 is a steal or a rip-off for a life-size flying unicorn (see pics)... I mean, I'm not sure where I'd go to compare prices on something like that.  I wasn't looking for anything in particular, and that's the right attitude for this place - you never know what you're going to find. Thankfully I followed Eugene's advice and only took in the cash I was willing to spend - otherwise, in addition to the neat little end table / magazine rack I found, I definitely would have walked out with a super cool but totally unnecessary $200 iron monkey statue (see pics).  One last note - it's a big place, and a good portion of it is pretty much outdoors (some covered, but not air conditioned), so if you go during the summer months, I recommend going early, before it gets too hot - they open at 10am (7 days a week). Otherwise you won't  be able to really spend the time this place deserves.

Yeah, yeah, I know there are already like fifty-something reviews for this place, most of them four or five stars, I don't care. Here's one more, another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardson's awesomeness...  The food's the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dick's Hideway around the corner, but eating here is a totally different experience. The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the high-backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party. I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops... OMG the scallops, so good when I think about 'em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like "OMG". Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here, I can't truly appreciate it because I don't eat the meat dishes, which, according to them, are even better. And they're probably right. They usually are.  Went with a group of 6 last week, which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardson's can handle (for much larger groups there's a private room available at Dick's). Service was super friendly and extremely efficient. Yeah, it can be a little pricy depending on what you order, but in my opinion, totally worth it. Sometimes you gotta splurge.

Love Love Love Los Dos. Love the atmosphere, Love the decor, Love the crap on the walls, Love the sign that says, Please control your kids (and friends). Love the food. Love the shrimp entrees, Love the veggie burro (enchilado style, of course - deep fried and drenched in cheese), Love the margaritas that are bigger than my head and Love Love Love the oh so soft and chewy sopapillas (with honey, of course).  The service, on the other hand, is a little more... complex.  One time when we were waiting for a table, when the guy called my name he called, "Last chance for Mark D". Last chance? So we jumped up and ran inside just before he gave our table away to someone else. I said WTF? He said, I called your name three times (He did so NOT call my name three times - we were sitting right in front of the door the entire time - there's no way). So I told him that. And we argued about it, went back and forth like.. did TOO, did NOT, did TOO, did NOT), until I spotted the other guy - the nice guy - standing behind him shaking his head (they've kind of got this good cop / bad cop thing going over there), and the nice guy was just shaking his head, as if to say, "Ah, don't worry about him, he's just in a bad mood." So we didn't, we sat down, ate some fabulous food, downed some rocking 'ritas and had a great time as always.   Here's the thing I want you to take away from that story: Even though it does seem like there's always at least one employee "in a bad mood", and the service may not be exactly friendly, it is attentive. I've never had to wait very long for anything, or not gotten what I wanted, I just maybe didn't get it with a smile. And for me, for this place, that's fine. That's just the way it is there. I think it helps knowing that going in. In my opinion, the food and atmosphere more than make up for it. Hell, I keep going back and back and back and back...

Realized as I was posting my review of Hoodlums that I've never actually reviewed my favorite place for CD shopping...  You'll find me here a couple times a week when I get bored at work browsing for CDs and DVDs. They've also got VHS tapes, records and video games for all platforms. The selection is incredible, the prices are reasonable and the quality of their used stuff is top notch. Believe me, I've tried to sell them some scratched stuff over the years and they won't take it. The employees are super friendly and I absolutely love their rewards program, which is free. Membership comes with cool discounts -  and a wallet card or keychain tag (they give you both - you choose which one to use) that they ring up with each purchase - it's also how they track your store credit if you trade/sell them your used stuff, which I do. All the time.

This isn't South Mountain, people. This isn't a damn nature hike. This isn't one of those trails where you wander along in flip-flops and talk about the weather and take pictures and smell the flowers and all that shit. This is exercise. This is Camelback f'in Mountain.   So I moved all the way from Chandler to East Phoenix just to be closer to Camelback. That's right. I love this mountain. I've been hiking both trails 2 or 3 times a week on and off for the last 5 or 6 years, and it never gets old.  There are 2 very different trails that start on opposite sides of the mountain and meet up at the top. Parking can be a pain, so I recommend riding your bike if possible (there are bike racks at both trailheads):  The Cholla Trail trailhead (east side of the mountain) is on E Cholla Ln, which heads west off of N Invergordon Rd just north of the Phoenician, about halfway between McDonald and Camelback. Park along N Invergordon Rd and walk up E Cholla Ln.   The Echo Canyon Trail trailhead (northwest corner of the mountain) is on N Echo Canyon Circle, which heads south off of E McDonald. There's actually a parking lot at the trailhead, complete with porta-potties and a water fountain, but it's pretty small and fills up fast. There's a little more parking along N Echo Canyon Circle, and then a couple of bigger parking lots further west down E McDonald (North side of the road). It's a pretty good walk/jog from these lots, though.  Both trails rock, but I prefer Echo. Cholla's nice and steady, slowly getting higher and harder with each turn. Echo, on the other hand, is all over the place - you're going up, you're going down, you're going around - it really keeps you on your toes. And Echo's got those rail sections everybody loves. Cholla's definitely got it's own some steep sections, too, but they're all right near the top. All things considered, I think Cholla is the easier of the two.  THINGS TO REMEMBER: 1. Water - you're gonna need it, so bring plenty of it. 2. Shoes - sneakers will work, but you're going to wish you had something a little more REI. 3. Gloves - I'm surprised I don't see more people wearing 'em. They really come in handy, especially on those steep sections where you're climbing a lot - or when you eat shit and land on your palms. 4. Ettiquette - YIELD, people! Hikers going down yield to hikers going up, and Hikers with kids/dogs yield to everybody.  Be careful, and have fun.

I suppose it's high time I review Fez, I've been there enough times. Usually for lunch or dinner or drinks, often with fellow Yelpers, as this seems to be the unofficial Yelp HQ. But as of this past weekend I've now done brunch as well, so my bases are covered. Good food, cool decor, excellent service - the staff is always friendly and efficient, even when I don't drop Thomas' name. Love the kisra & garlic hummus, but my favorites are the fries - they're all good, but those cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries - oh, man - I could just sit and munch on those things all night long. And I have before. A few times. My meat-eating friends rave about the burgers - haven't had one myself, I'm waiting for the veggie patty option Thomas swears is coming.

With the new black bean burger I had for dinner tonight - which is only 5 bucks for the entire month of January - Fez now has it all. It's not perfect, but it's damn good. I'm torn on the goat cheese - probably not my first pick to go with the black bean patty - but I do so love goat cheese that I'll forgive them. And I think they could do without the radishes. I don't know, just never thought they were good sandwich toppings. Also, the patty lacks a little in consistency, kind of gets crushed and you lose bits and pieces here and there with each bite. But it's quite tasty, so again, I'll forgive them. Someone said it was spicy, but I didn't think so. Will I order it again? That's the real question. And the answer is Hells yeah. Thanks Fez for thinking of us vegetarians and quasi-vegetarians that dig a good veggie burger.   Oh, and apparently they've got a few drink specials that are dependent on ordering the black bean burger, how cool is that? My advice - check it out.

I don't like eggplant, never have. So why did I order the Eggplant Parmigiana Hot Sub my first time at Mamma Mia's? ...I don't know. Weird, huh? Yeah, well, I'm glad I did, it was delicious, and certainly not short on cheese. MMMM... cheese. Actually stopped by here with a friend a few weeks back after seeing the good reviews on Yelp, but I guess we missed the part about there only being one table and a few other seats inside, and we were in the mood for something a little... bigger. But I kept them in mind, and this time I just wanted take-out. I was in and out in just a few minutes, and the staff was very pleasant. They also deliver, which I will definitely be taking advantage of in the future. And love the Yelp sticker on the door.  Oh, also got a cannoli. Yum. The last one, too. So if you were that guy behind me in line that missed out, well, tough titties. You snooze, you lose, pal.

Followed up my initial visit to Mamma Mia's with a couple delivery orders, and both were incredible. Designed my own calzone (black olive, bell pepper & pineapple), which came loaded like a freight train (you'll have to forgive me, I woke up to GN'R this morning), and overflowing with cheese. MMMM... cheese. Again. Then the lobster ravioli (really rich - absolutely decadent - after which I was compelled to hit the treadmill as soon as I could move, which wasn't until several hours later). Also tried the cheese garlic bread and the Mamma Mia Special Salad (salami on the side), and I'm convinced - it's all good here.  No problems with delivery - first time was quoted 45 mins, and driver arrived in 40. Second time was also quoted 45, but driver arrived in 30. Highly recommended.

Had a wonderful dinner date here Friday night. Couldn't believe there weren't more people than there were. Only a few tables were occupied. It's such a charming little place. The colorful walls and plentiful folk art create a really cool atmosphere. But it's the guitar player that clinches the deal. Service was phenomenal - our waiter was super friendly and attentive.   Food was spectacular, from the guacamole appetizer to the Chilean Sea Bass filet that we shared. Definitely not what I was expecting. It's Mexican, but quite different any Mexican I've ever had.  We'll definitely be back. Soon.  Oh, also want to add a quick thank you to Laura R - it was her fantastic review of this place that caught my attention in the first place. It's been at the top of my Bookmark list for the last month.

Had such a good experience last week I jumped at the chance for a return visit last night for Julia's UYE. But now I'm thinking I may have jumped the gun giving them 5 stars right off the bat. Yes, the food was still delicious, the service was still friendly and attentive, the atmosphere still rocked (especially with the guitar guy - Love that guy!)... But it's the high prices I have a problem with. See, the food's good, but not that good, not good enough to warrant the high prices. Especially the special combo appetizer plate, a tiny little thing that ran $24.95, which we didn't discover until the bill came. And we apparently unintentionally ordered 4 of them. oops.  Thanks Julia, for a super fun UYE!!

Can't believe I haven't reviewed Carly's yet - it's sooooo good.   It's sandwiches, soups and salads mostly, but don't let that fool you into this is just a lunch spot - it's good for lunch, sure, but the local art, dim lighting and live music (some Fridays, most Saturday and Sunday nights) make this a cool place to grab dinner as well.  The grilled panini's are absolutely delicious - my favorites - both of which are vegetarian - are the Europa (roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, spinach & smoked mozzarella) and the Tuscan (sundried tomato, roasted red pepper, spinach, provolone & pesto). There's also a majorly delicious salmon one I tried for the first time just the other night, but it was so good I don't remember what else was on it, all I remember was what I was thinking at the time, which was OMG this is a good F'in salmon sandwich. Also - not my thing, but vegan bread is available for all sandwiches.  I must admit that the service wasn't exactly top notch on my most recent visit, but I've been here before - many times - and that's very unusual for them.

Keep your eyes open, I almost drove right by this place. Might have been because it's a lot more house-looking than restaurant-looking. Not complaining, just saying. I love the converted house thing, just wasn't expecting it. Or maybe it was because the Yelper I was following turned into the parking lot a moment after two cars cut in front of me and she disappeared from view. Either way, I found it, and I'm glad I did.  First, I gotta give 'em props for the way they handled our large, unexpected and occasionally raucous group - service was friendly and efficient. Lisa G herself even came over to say hello, pose for pictures and answer detailed questions about her fabulous food. Did I just say fabulous? Weird. Not part of my typical nomenclature. Did I just say nomenclature? Did I use it correctly?   Anyhoo - was part of a large group like I said, so I got to sample/steal bits and pieces of several different menu options.. cheese, cranberries, and candied almonds from the antipasto plate, shrimp and veggies from the skewer plate, more candied almonds from the antipasto plate, the empanadas - ooh, the empanadas - they were the best part. I'm not sure which I enjoyed more, the eggplant/zuchini/blue cheese & pine nuts or the Mushroom/onions/almonds & parmesan cheese.. Probably the eggplant, which is weird, because I don't normally care for eggplant. Oh, but the mushrooms were so good. Hmm.. think I'll have to go back and have them again to be sure. Lastly, we ordered the seared ahi mini-sandwiches with wasabi sauce, which I loved - though the Yelper I shared them with didn't so much. But she's crazy, you shouldn't listen to her.

Never thought I'd find anything better than Bookman's. But then I found.. well, Bookman's. See I been goin' to the Mesa store for years now and never complained once, but lately, I don't know, even with people bringing in new trade every day, seems like the shelves have been stocked with the same old stuff. Not to mention they've been turning down my same old box of stuff for a while now - used to be I brought it in enough times they'd eventually take it off my hands.. So I ventured out to the Phoenix store yesterday.  Wow.   I must admit, I was a little confused at first - the layout's a little disorienting.. Trade counter's to your right when you walk in (drop your stuff off around the back of the counter) and the Cashier counter is to your left. Books straight ahead, Media to the left. The Media section - that's what the wow was for. Probably twice the size of the Mesa store. Usually I stroll through the CDs and DVDs - 10, 15 minutes maybe. I was there for an hour and a half yesterday. Couldn't believe the selection of CDs, DVDs, Laser Discs, LPs, VHS, cassette tapes, video games, Books on CD/tape.. Other thing that's cool - they've got a toys/games room for action figures, board games,  puzzles (so many puzzles)..   I do have one other update for Bookman's fans in general (noticed the same thing at the other store) - apparently they're not sticking to that old A Trade (media), B Trade (books) thing anymore - used to be you got different levels of credit depending on what you brought it, but not anymore - it's all A Trade now, good for anything in the store.  And yes, this store has an armoir full of porn, too ;)

This place is now in my 'hood after my recent move to East Phoenix and I kept meaning to try it out but just didn't get around to it until I spotted my Yelp friends' high recommendations, and of course they were right - this place rocks. The Lemon Pepper Shrimp was so delicious (and yes, they have brown rice). We also ordered the hot n sour soup, which - vegetarians beware - is generously filled with not just tofu, but shrimp and pork as well. Not a pork eater myself, I'll have to take my cohort's word for it that it was equally delicious. Meals were reasonably priced, especially the chef's specials. Service was fine - quite attentive, actually. Atmosphere was interesting - nothing to rave about, but we happened to be there as the sun was setting, and the place seemed to take on a bit of a cooler vibe the darker it got. Enough so that we took our time finishing up our Sake Bombers and just hung out for a while. Oh yeah, we'll be back.

Woah talk about confusing, starting with the entrance - we walked in through the back door, right through the kitchen.. still not sure if that was actually an acceptable thing to do. Nobody said anything if it wasn't. Then what? Looked around for a hostess, didn't see one - were we supposed to seat ourselves or get in line? Which line? The big one going out the door? The coffee station? The pastry station? Did we have to go to each one for something different? Would have asked somebody if there had been anyone to ask. Like I said, confusing. Won't be that way for you, of course, because I'm going to lay it all out for you...  Ok, so there ain't really all that much to lay out.. It's pretty simple, actually. Split up, that's my advice - one of yous grab a table - there aren't many when they're busy - and somebody else get in line - doesn't matter which one. We ordered everything we needed from the coffee station. Apparently that's a secret, because the other one was going out the door, like I said.  The food - we shared the french pancakes, these super thin little slices of Heaven, and the tofu "chorizo" burrito. Rockin' good breakfast. Very tasty, and a nice change of pace. Beware: the orange juice is freshly squeezed and jam packed with pulp. Cool if that's your thing, not so much if it ain't.  And in retrospect, all that confusion - was all kind of part of the charm of the place. Weird, huh?

Finally got around to trying this place out for breakfast Saturday morning and loved it - shared the veggie scramble sandwich and cinnamon french toast, both of which were delicious, and reasonably priced. Kind of a limited menu selection, but if everything else is just as good, that's not necessarily a negative thing. Extremely friendly staff - and they've got frequent customer cards, which I totally dig - my wallet's full of 'em. Most of them I don't ever get around to filling up or cashing in, but it's the thought that counts, you know - that promise of the free food reward at some point in the indefinite future... This one, though, I have a good feeling about - I might just cash this one in.

Been working on filling up my frequent customer card at Acacia Cafe, still in love with the little place. Turns out Sunday's are special because they've got a few extra menu items for their Sunday Brunch, including an awesome Fruit & Nut Waffle, with cranberries, raisins and walnuts baked right in. Yum. Other Sunday specials include Eggs Benedict and Eggs Albuquerque. If you've never been to Acacia on a Sunday, check it out.

I'm impressed. The last time I experienced service this bad it was intentional, on account the manager of the place turned out to be my girlfriend's ex-boyfriend and hated my guts. But today at Changs was like the perfect storm - the simultaneous occurrence of employee mistakes and oversights which, taken individually, would be far less powerful than the overall experience resulting of their chance combination...  First I had to send my hot and sour soup back because of the chicken (don't eat chicken, wouldn't have ordered it had it been mentioned on the menu) in exchange for crab wontons. I should have asked, right - that's what you're thinking... Well, maybe so. Regardless, it took ten minutes to flag someone down to make the exchange, and as a result, the lemon pepper shrimp entree we ordered arrived before the appetizer, without plates, with white rice instead of requested brown. Ten minutes for the brown rice, fifteen for the plates, and we had to ask for them three times. Three times. The last time the guy actually laughed like, "Oh my god I'm such an idiot, I forgot again, Ha Ha." Jerk. Then we waited another 20 minutes for a refill of Tea, another 10 for water. The food? It was ok. Borderline good. But certainly not worth the wait and the service.  When we got the bill, of course the hot and sour soup was still on it, so that had to be corrected, which took another fifteen minutes. And then - and this is the icing on the cake, the real kick in the teeth, the coup de gr√¢ce: there was no fortune in my damn fortune cookie. That's right. No fortune. What's a fortune cookie without a fortune? Just a damn cookie, that's what. No fortune. That's F'd up. It's like a bad omen or something, isn't it? F these guys.

Something weird happens when we go to Dick's for breakfast. It's not just breakfast, and it's not about us. It's an event, and it's all about Dick's. The ride there - it's all we talk about - what we ordered last time, how frellin' good it was, what we're going to order this time (That's right - we've got the menu memorized. You don't? You obviously haven't been to Dick's enough). So we order, we sip our drinks (Bloody Mary for me, Mimosa for my breakfast buddy), and we talk about Dick's - how much we like Dick's, how cool Dick's is, how we need to come back to Dick's more often. And then they bring the food (best shrimp quesadillas EVER! the huevos rancheros are damn fine too), so no more more talking. Just eating. You may hear a few mmmm's and ahhh's, definitely a couple of ohmygoditsogood's, but no real dialogue. Not until our plates are bare. And the drive home we tell each other how good it was, like we weren't both there.

mmmm... eggplant. So it's Sunday morning and I just scarfed down the second half of my eggplant parm sandwich from last night - so good - and I wasn't the only one with leftovers - the portions were huge - and all I keep wondering is how the hell did it take me this long to check this place out? What a gem. Decor was charming, service was impeccable, but most importantly, the food was delicious and reasonably priced ($8 sandwiches, $10-$15 entrees).

To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.  But then, today turned out to be a special day... I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?  It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.  So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).

Incredible pancakes: banana walnut, lemon ricotta, blueberry & brown sugar, or just plain if you're a total lame-oid. Amazing French toast, too: cinnamon raisin, or stuffed with whipped cream cheese & blueberry compote if you wanna be a gluttonous pig like me. Be a gluttonous pig like me! Be a gluttonous pig like me!  The breakfast sandwiches are good, too - but not nearly as indulgent :(  Reasonably priced too, everything on the breakfast menu is right around 6 bucks.

My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour.

I love this library. After Burton Barr, coolest library in the valley.   Favorite things: -they've got library card keychain tags so you never have to forget to bring your card with you. -the website. no, they don't have every book, CD and DVD waiting for you at all times, sometimes other people check them out. So go online, reserve it - they'll send you an email when it's available, and it'll be waiting on the shelf for you when you get there -you can have up to 50 items out at a time (used to be 10 at a time for CDs and DVDs, but not anymore) -parking: there's always plenty of spots available, and it's covered (particularly important during the hot summer months) -free internet -super friendly service

Wow, what a cool place! Retro and vintage furniture mostly, but all sorts of other stuff as well, including some clothes, paintings and various knick-knacks and collectibles. Thanks Nadia, for your excellent first review, which I happened to catch that same day, just as I was heading over to the general area, so I decided to stop by on my way home. I'm so glad I did - I found the coolest old bookshelf for only $60. I also picked up an end table for $12. Unbelievable prices! And so much cooler than that crappy generic euro-trash stuff I'd been thinking about buying from IKEA. Couldn't believe the great values. With the frequently rotating stock, Michael Todd's will definitely be a regular monthly stop for me.

Rented a 14' truck and tow dolly from this location last month when I moved from Phoenix to Austin and received phenomenal service from the manager, Mr. Chris West. He was quick, courteous and hilarious. Seriously, this guy should be on like Comedy Central Presents or something.. that show's still on, isn't it? I don't don't know, haven't had cable in years. But it used to be funny - and this guy was funny.  Thank you, Chris. It had been a long stressful day already when I came in to pick up the truck and you made me smile. Thanks for the extra miles. And thanks for your assistance with the tow dolly. Your patience must have been wearing thin by the third time we came back with questions, but if it was, you didn't let it show. We made it ok, in case you were wondering. It was a long F'n drive, but we made it. Tell you what though, the location where we dropped off the truck in Austin - they were complete dickheads. But that's another review..

Best used media store in town, hands down. Open late (til 10pm), and dog-friendly to boot (leashed, of course). How cool is that? Me and my pooch like to hang out here a few times a month, browsing the stacks. They've got everything here: books, magazines, comics, video games for all platforms, action figures, sheet music, music on CDs, records and tapes, movies on DVD & VHS - think I might even seen a few laser discs... And porn of course (in the brown cabinet left of the entrance), if that's your thing :D  Got some trade? Drop it off on the counter on your left. They'll give you a playing card to identify your stash and an E.T.A. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 20-30 minutes for the verdict - of course I'm usually browsing for a lot longer than that. They pay pretty well. Not as much as Zia for music and movies, but they'll take stuff that Zia won't. Your choice of cash or trade credit, which is broken out into 'A' & 'B'. A is good for anything in the store, B is just for books.

I don't mind the cattle call or the delays or the crappy seats, I don't - it's Southwest, you know that going in - you're gonna get what you paid for. It's the service, or lack thereof, that kills me. Southwest employees are so unprofessional, they're teen-age kids at home alone when their parents are in Europe for a month - inviting all their friends over, trashing the house, breaking into the liquor cabinet... Seriously, I think the flight attendant on my last flight was drunk. You should have heard her little safety announcement/orientation speech. Here's an excerpt (you'll have to imagine her intermittent hiccups and giggles yourself): 'The light button over your seat will turn on your light. The flight attendant button, on the other hand, will not turn on your flight attendant.' Amusing? Sure. Did the attitude instill a sense of confidence that an emergency situation would be handled quickly & efficiently? Hell no.

One of my favorite theatres in the valley. Why? Because it's never crowded. Ever. I've been there on weekend nights, weekday evenings,  middle of the afternoon - nobody there, I don't get it. But it makes for a much more enjoyable movie-going experience. Otherwise, same as every other theater in town.  Saw Space Monkeys with my lil bro this afternoon, which was amusing - a little fast & loose with the science for my taste, but in its defense it was an animated picture about monkeys in space - but once again, nobody there. I think there were maybe four or five other folks in the theater. Granted it was Space Chimps, but even out in the lobby, hardly anybody around.  One note about the parking garage (besides don't forget to get your ticket validated): The signs on the wall with the big '5' on them - that's the speed limit, not the floor number. One night me and my friend walked around forever looking for the car because when we pulled up I said, "We're on 5, don't forget it." Yes, I'm admitting it, in front of everyone. It was my fault. Now let it go... Yeah, so we walked around and around the 5th floor forever trying to find the car. It was down on 2, btw. oops.

Stopped by on my way to the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE at Metro Brasserie to pick up an oil change gift card, and I was there for half an hour. Worst service ever. If I hadn't waited until the last minute and wasn't just down the street from Metro Brasserie, I would've walked out. But I did, and I was, so I couldn't. So despite all my rage, I was - come on, you know the line - trapped like a rat in a cage. What - too 90s for you? Come on, Pumpkins rocked, admit it.  Anyway, so first I stood there in the waiting room, me and the other three people waiting for their cars. There was nobody behind the register. I asked them, "Is there somebody working?" "Define working," one of them said. The others laughed.  When the clerk finally showed up ten minutes later, he came in and started messing with the register, which I was standing in front of. "Hello," I said. "Wait," he said. I told him I just wanted a gift card. He nodded. One of the mechanics came in. Somebody's car was done. He called the guy, the guy came over.  Here's their exchange: clerk: Your car's ready. customer: Did you rotate the tires? clerk: Yes. I mean no. (looks at paperwork) I don't know. (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back in). No. Do you want them rotated? customer: Yes. clerk: (sighs, waves customer away like he's swatting a fly) customer: I'll go ahead and pay for it, you know, since I'm standing here. clerk: oh, uh, I don't know if I can... (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside) Okay. customer: They're pulling my car out. clerk: What? customer: They're pulling my car out. I don't think they're not going to rotate the tires. clerk: do you still want the tires rotated? customer: No. clerk: (rings him up for oil change, no tire rotation)  My turn. me: "I'd like a gift card." clerk: "How much?" me: (tell him amount)  clerk: (stares at register for 5 minutes, every once in a while glancing over at piece of paper taped to wall) me: Everything okay? clerk: (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside with mechanic. Together they stare at register for another 5 minutes, then mechanic goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside) mechanic: You want a gift card? me: Yes. mechanic: How much? me: (tell him amount) mechanic: (goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside, stares at register, reads piece of paper, re-reads piece of paper, stares at register...) Finally they figure it out - he's got to swipe the gift card. Of course his hands are covered with grease. He hands me the card, covered in grease. Nice. Don't worry, Gabs - I cleaned it up pretty good before handing it over ;)  Man, am I glad I didn't take my car here.

Cool place. Love the atmosphere. Went for dinner Friday night, arrived around 7 or so. No self-parking available, but complimentary valet was quick + easy.  Host offered 20 minute wait for table or sit at the bar - we chose the bar. There are two, a small one right by the entrance, and a much larger one along the north wall, which was where we sat, which apparently was just added a few days earlier. Bartender was friendly and attentive, specialty drinks were awesome. As Eric mentioned in his review - they use Tito's Handmade Vodka in the Ginger Press (being from Austin I always enjoy seeing Tito's on the menu).  We shared the vegetable plate app and swordfish entree. Vegetable plate was incredible - served in generous portions with an very tasty dipping sauce. Good thing too, because the swordfish was quite small, not to mention a little overcooked. After a few bites we went right back to the vegetables, which we didn't even finish.  We'll definitely be back.

I gave them 4 hours notice--needed a cab at 2pm to go to the airport. 2pm no cab. 2:10 I call, dispatcher says he's almost there 5mins max. 2:20 I call, dispatcher 10mins max. 2:30 I call, dispatcher says he's turning the corner. 2:35 dispatcher calls me to verify my address. I say the one I've given you 4 times now? He says yeah, that's the one. Driver's 2 blocks over. 2:45 cab shows up, driver complaining about how he can't go pick some dude up at a casino cause he's gotta take me to the airport. Never again.

Never had a bad meal at any Thai Basil, but especially this one on the corner of Rural and Chandler. I usually do take-out, but I have eaten in as well. The take-out experience has always been quick & easy - my order has always been waiting for me when I walked in. Nice, quiet dining in experience - soft music, some cool asian stuff to look at. Not usually very crowded - only real traffic seems to be the steady stream of people coming in to pick up to go orders. The curry dishes are delicious, and served in generous portions (especially when ordered for take-out). Courteous service & quality food. The spice factor seems a little inconsistent. They ask you how spicy you want it - I tell them the same thing every time, and sometimes it's really spicy and sometimes not so much.  My only real complaint - the hours. They close everyday between lunch and dinner from 4-5pm, which somehow always seems to be when the craving strikes. And they're closed on Sundays.

I like seafood. I like pizza. So I ordered the seafood pizza. Big mistake. I had been waiting about 20 minutes for it when the waitress informed me that it didn't look good, and she'd asked the cook to start over. It didn't look good? What does that mean? Sounded like she was looking out for me, though, so I didn't complain. Well, I don't know what the first one looked like, but it couldn't have been good if it looked worse than the second one, which arriving another 20 minutes later, kind of looked like... soup! Seafood pizza soup. The sauce (1 part tomato sauce / 3 parts water?) was actually dripping off the plate. I tried to pull out a slice and all I got was soggy crust, because all the toppings, cheese included, slid right off and landed with a splash. The shrimp were mushy, like little bad bananas. The squid (I think it was squid, but I don't know that for sure) tasted like pencil erasers. Really Gross (that's right, that's no typo, that's Gross with a capital 'G').

Spent the afternoon here with my little bro. Fun place. He's 7 though (almost 8, he keeps reminding me) and many of the exhibits/activities really seem geared for a younger audience. Still lots to see and do for him though, from the musical pots & pans to the beanbag corner. His favorite - the Grand Ballroom, where there's this magnetic wall of adjustable pieces of shelves and pipes he could move around to create new and interesting corridors and paths for golf balls to follow as he explored the exciting world of cause & effect and chain reactions.  My advice - watch yo step. The kids there are nuts, hyped on whoknowswhat, sprinting back and forth from exhibit to exhibit, nervous parents right on their heels.. I also found myself wishing I'd brought along a little bottle of hand sanitizer. Who knows where those millions of little hands have been, you know what I'm sayin'? And what was with the lack of shoes? I'm sure it's all in my head, but here I am four hours later, thinking I can still smell little kid feet. Gross.

So curious me, I had to see what all the Yelpabaloo was about (yeah, that's a new Yelp-ism - be sure to jot it down for your next review), and I must admit, this place lived up to the hype for me. It's a little outside my normal dining zone, but since I was downtown with my lil bro seeing a movie at Arizona Center, we decided to stop by on our way home.  The vegetarian pizza was delicious. Loaded with fresh veggies, including artichoke hearts, on top of an incredible thin & crispy crust, I just wish I'd ordered a larger size so I'd have more leftovers. Don't get me wrong, the portions are generous, I just wanted more.  There's definitely more on the menu than pizza, including pasta and calzones, which, after watching a few being served around me and listening to the oohs and ahhs while they were consumed, I will definitely be ordering next time.  The place is small - very small, less than a dozen tables - so I imagine it probably fills up quickly in the evenings. So small in fact that several conversations were restaurant wide - creating quite the communal dining experience - one of which involved Yelp. The owner's a big fan, as several patrons including myself mentioned it as their reason for checking them out.  My lil bro's review: "Awesome." The only thing that would have made it better, he said, were video games. Who can argue with that?

Look, I don't have a problem with the concept. Bring on the fun and sexy girls in lingerie. I'll eat crappy food, I'll put up with bad service, I probably won't even notice the dirty restaurant. But if that's your thing, if fun and sexy girls are your gimmick, you better make damn sure your girls are fun and sexy. Which the girls at Fantasy Grill are not. So what have you got when you remove fun and sexy girls from the equation? Crappy food, bad service and a dirty restaurant. F'in gross, man. Stay away.

Looking for a new four-legged family member? Try these guys. They're one of the few animal rescue organizations with a true "no-kill" policy - they keep their animals until they can find a forever family. They've saved more than 9,000 dogs and cats from Maricopa County's euthanasia lists since 1995.  I've adopted two wonderful dogs from them over the years. And now, to thank them for matching me with such great critters, I volunteer my time walking dogs for them, since they have no central facility. Most of their animals reside in volunteer foster homes and leased boarding facilities.  Their matchmaking process is superb - they are truly committed to finding the perfect home for each animal.

Having never been a Comicon before, I don't really have anything to compare this particular one to, but I have to imagine they're, well, usually a little, well, I don't know, bigger, I guess. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot going on, what with all the comic book and action figure booths, people in costumes (everything from ghostbusters to Anime shit that goes right the fuck over my head), guest signings, Jedi training and film festivals, but, I don't know, still just felt like, well, Mesa. Don't get me wrong, me and my lil bro had a blast, me trying not to check out the parade of cute little goth princesses that were obviously too young for me to be checking out, him undergoing the early stages of Jedi training.. he received his official Padawan Learner status, btw. Yeah, that's a Jedi thing. Oh yeah, now he's well on his way to becoming quite the guardian of peace and justice in the Galaxy. I'm quite proud.  Tons of cool guests.. Data, Wesley AND Counselor Troi from Star Trek Next Generation, dabo girl Leeta from Deep Space Nine (schwing), Chewbacca, the magically babelicious Kate from Silver Spoons (who tested very high on the strokability scale when I was but a wee lad, btw.. No, I don't know where the Wayne's World references are coming from, haven't seen it in years..), Fucking K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider, and the original Incredible Hulk, Mr. Lou Fucking Ferrigno. Oh, can't forget Admiral Motti from Star Wars.. yeah, yeah, you know, the dude whose lack of faith Vader found disturbing - that's right, the very first recipient of "the Force choke". Nice.

Over a period of 6 years I took 4 dogs and 2 cats here for various check-ups, ailments and boarding, and never once had a bad experience. The lab technicians are always friendly and and they almost always remember my animals by name the moment I walk in (the animals, not me - they have no idea who I am).  The doctors are extremely knowledgable. My first visit there, actually - I took my dear old friend and terrier Salinger in about a skin condition that 3 other vets across the valley had unsuccessfully and expensively attempted to treat. Dr. Mott was able to isolate the cause during the first exam (no additional tests required!).  While I've met most of the doctors on staff, Dr. Mott is definitely my favorite. On the so very sad day I had to lay my buddy Salinger to rest following a wicked battle with the big C (he was a warrior, he really was), Dr. Mott and one of the lab techs actually drove all the way out to my house in Chandler so that he would be in a calm peaceful place. Thank you Dr. Mott! I can't tell you how much that meant to me and Sal.  They truly love animals here - if you live in Ahwatukee they're perfectly located - but also not too far from West Chandler or South Tempe.
