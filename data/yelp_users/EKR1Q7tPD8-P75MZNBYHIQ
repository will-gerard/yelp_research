I'm pretty irritated that my 2 pizzas, quoted at 19-29 minutes just took 1hr 8 minutes to get here. Completely unacceptable. I'm shocked it was even warm at all. Though the cheese was no longer melty. And James was hardly apologetic. I'll order from Val Vista next time.

I make it a point to get corned beef hash anytime it's house made and let me say it was pretty good!!! I also got a half order of the brioche French toast which was yummy. I only give this place 4 stars because it was some of the worst service I've received. It was on a Sunday morning so it was busy, but you'd think they'd also make it a point to be properly staffed. It took our server 15 minutes to make initial contact with us. And another 15 before asking what we'd like to eat. When asked about certain things on the menu, she either hadn't tried it or had no real feedback from other customers. I would've thought she was brand new, except for the fact that she could rattle off all of the types of bread available for toast. Weird. I'll probably go to the other location on Southern because I enjoyed the food but could definitely do without the terrible service.

Overpriced and underwhelming. Burger was mediocre and bland. Not sure what makes french fries dry, but they were dry and flaky...don't know how else to explain them!

I haven't had street tacos this incredible since I was actually in Mexico. Im upset I've been living here for years without knowing about it! A great place to take out of towners looking for an authentic Mexican food experience. Pork mole was out of this world. I recommend getting the 5 street tacos so you can choose 5 different meats. So, so, so delicious!
