not sure what the previous yelper was thinking...if you want an actual leather bound book go to a library.  if you're interested in comics and books containing comics or about specific comics then come here.  chill staff, ton 'o' comics, lotsa toys, decent prices. i'll be back.

so happy to have found this place!   ...random driving... me: hey! there's a oriental supermarket. husband: we're going!  bin bin rice crackers-so deliciously sweet, salty, and crunchy. jamaican patties-number one thing we missed after our trip. lumpia-no more living in the bay area ment no more lumpia, not anymore!  so many different foods from so many different places.  brought my little sister with the 2livekrew and she was a bit afraid...the smell instantly turned her off. however, i think she warmed up a bit after watching the husband and i get super excited over all of our finds.   don't think we'll make the drive solely for this place. worth stopping by whenever we're in the area or in the need of some bin bin rice crackers!

not only have i been going here since i was a wee one, so has mi mum. yes, the food is that good, consistently! when i lived in sf and came to visit this was my first stop in town...i missed it terribly. so i came back, for you popo's...well, not really. the things i love: cheese crisp, mexican pizza, the complete, chimichanga! also, for some reason the sarsaparilla just tastes better here. my 1 year old loves their salsa so much that she refuses to share, i kid you not. in fact she tried to drink it. like i said, it is that good here.

cute joint, good beer selection, art collection is ever changing, live music, smoker's section...just make sure you get here a little early on the weekends otherwise you'll be standing.

the food was bland and uninspired. the service was quick and friendly. another reviewer hit the nail on the head with the salsa comparing to pace from the supermarket. we ordered: a tostada, steak & chicken fajitas, the #1 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef taco, and chicken strips & fries for our little terror tots. again i find myself agreeing with another reviewer-$2.50 for a bloody soda is a bit pricey as well. the husband asked for a wee bit more sour cream and guac. to top off his last fajita...the server brought them quickly, however they were huge portions and ice cold-which he then decided to charge an additional $5 for. it's a good thing i didn't marry a sucker, after arguing with the waiter, the manager complied...however, it didn't come off of the 18%% gratuity that the waiter automatically received from our coupon. next time i want mexican food i'll drive to 67th and indian school and go to popo's...they never fail to deliver.

they arrived around 6:30pm in front of...oh, i forgot the name-grow something or another, they were really nice though...we were the first folks there, and kinda hung off to the side as they began setting up. but then people began arriving in small clusters. we took a seat and allowed them to finish their business. the lady came right over to our table when they were ready and took our order first. awesome! both the man and lady were super friendly and joked a bit with my husband about our busy little one year old.  the dogs came super quick and they were absolutely divine! so good that the husband and i split another after our first. gluttons we are, yes. but anything wrapped in bacon and snuggled in that bun is worth it in my book.   four dogs and a coke totaled out to $13.50...threw a few bucks in for a tip and called it a night.  all in all i've gotta say it was worth the drive from goodyear and the wait for arrival and set up.

dead on...meh, i've experienced better...best part of the evening playing with the food. scared the daughter with crawfish, convinced the son to eat escargot, then attempted to get both kids to kiss a giant shrimp with eyes. the husband says three stars, but honestly i don't think i'd eat at this joint again.

Walked in and there was a wee bit of a line. Moved quickly, no biggie, no drama (3 yr old boy's boy and 7 mo. little princess) Ordered  the breakfast pizza, a burrito and some oj-the super cheap husband balked at the price of the oj. The husband was turned around when he tasted the oj-fresh, so fresh. A little more hyped than i thought it deserved, but overall good stuff.

i dream about this place...in fact my stomach is growling just thinking about it. been here a few times, always down to try something new each time. however, my heart belongs to the eddie lopez burger. i've yet to get down on the cheese curds, the fries are tasty as well as the onion rings. the kids and i spend at least a good 15 minutes perusing the soda selection. this place makes me happy, so very very happy. i just wish i didn't live so bloody far...

Great food, great prices, great portions. The rumor on the street is true, the biscuits and gravy are phenomenal! Service rocked as well, never saw the bottom of my coffee cup until it was time to exit the building. I will be back, oh yes, I will be back.

carne asada fries! fully loaded nachos! the grande breakfast burrito! these are the awesome things we get and split between myself, the husband, and a 3 and 1 year old. it's more than enough food to satisfy all of our appetites as well as any mexican food craving. i totally dig the salsa as well. it's nice to go somewhere and feed an entire family for around $10...and that includes a delicious horchata.
