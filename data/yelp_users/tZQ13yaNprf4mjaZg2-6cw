If you are looking for a restaurant in north Scottsdale, with a good atmosphere and even better food. Look no further than here. The staff is amazing and the food is all local. You can just taste the freshness, you can also wash it down with a tasty beverage as they have a full selection of beer and wine! I highly recommend giving this place a try!

A grouping of 3 or 4 come twice a month from 11am-130pm and they usually get really busy meaning long wait times. So today a coworker and I walked down at 11am to try and beat the rush. I decided to try the Grilled Addiction food truck, upon looking at the menu the tri tip sandwich sounded amazing from its description. Although its $11+ price with tax that included no side or drink (you can get tots for $3 more) was a little concerning but I figured that it would be worth it. I placed my order for the sandwich with no onions. Then I waited, and waited some more. After about 20 minutes I asked if my order was getting close and was told that the tri tip takes a little longer since it is being cooked. Ok, fair enough. After about minute 35 I finally received my sandwich. I immediately noticed that it contained onions and was very small for the $11 price tag. I went back up to my office (about a minute elevator ride) and say down to eat my sandwich. When I took the first bite I noticed that the 5 little pieces of tri tip that were in the mostly bread sandwich were ice cold. Even though I was told that the tri tip just came off the grill. Needless to say I will not be going back to the Grilled Addiction and I would recommend to avoid it as well unless you like a place that gets your order wrong as it serves you ice cold over priced sandwiches that you wait 30 minutes for.
