My favorite place to eat in Arizona. My family eats here regularly for their glutton free options. Would recommend to anyone the staff is nice and the good is great. Worth a try.

This was a horrible experience. Top shelf is unaccommodating to anyone with dietary needs/ allergies. I looked online and couldn't find a gluten free menu for this place. So I called and asked the lady on the phone for gluten free options. She recommended the number three (2 tacos and 1 enchilada). When I got to the restaurant to pick up the food, I asked the other lady at the counter to verify with the chefs if the dish was gluten free. She told me that nothing at top shelf is gluten free, except maybe the fajita meat. I told her that the lady on the phone said it was and the other girl at the counter (who I spoke too) claimed she never heard me mention gluten free on the phone. I asked her if she would talk with the chefs to see if they could specialty make me something and she didn't. She got the manager and all he did was take the plate off the bill, didn't even talk to me to try to accommodate me and prepare me something new. I will never go back to this place again. I would give this place zero stars if I could. Take my advice: don't waste your time.

I go to this place for everything we need for our toys. One of the only shops with good gear and a way better price then ride now

Recently my AC stopped working and I called Morehart AC to see what was going on. Tom the service technician showed me that my thermostat was not working and replaced it. My unit is working great and I love how the new thermostat looks. Thanks for all your help we will call again if we have any more problems!
