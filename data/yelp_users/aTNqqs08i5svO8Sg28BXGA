Overall this place has been consistent with its quality and service.    I am a huge fan of their pre/post work out shakes.  They usually use ISOPURE protein which is one of the best qualities on the market.  They are usually great tasting and I appreciate the loyalty cards.  They are a bit pricey but nowhere near the outrageous amounts I pay for a similar drink in the Bay Area.  In regards to supplements, I find that they have a well in depth knowledge of the products they carry.  Prices are competitive however sometimes I have heard they try to match prices online, sometimes they are unable to.  I have to say the continued friendliness of the staff will still allow myself to stop by whenever I am in the neighborhood.

Absolutely disgusting.  One star to the nice guy who waited on our table.  Very nice and professional.  Prosciutto was frozen.  Their bread appetizer had a cheese drenched in oil that was uneatable.  The middle of the bread was still unbaked.  I wonder if frozen foods and under baked breads are the owner's idea of "fresh" and "made from scratch.".....  Beer tasted old.  We offered to pay for our drinks and left.  I am glad we didn't risk trying our main courses.  I should've taken the hint when this place was empty on a Friday night.  Must have spent good money on having their bad reviews removed (thanks Yelp).

A staple of a local neighborhood sushi bar, Masa never fails to leave me feeling satisfied.  Now I must start with the obvious points to this friendly and cool place.  It is Korean owned.  Not that this generally would be a problem but I understand that in some instances Sushi reinterpreted through the eyes of Koreans is not exactly the same as that of a standard Japanese restaurant.  However, they manage to do a good job of finding some balance within the menu that caters to an Americanized audience while offering nods to us purist.  I understand they used Ponzu sauce, if you don't like it then don't come here!  I have to admit I've evolved into sort of a sushi snob in recent years.  I have traveled frequently to LA, SF and NY where I have had some of the best Japanese food outside of Nagoya.  What I appreciate about Masa is that they offer a decent extensive menu including Yakisoba (a favorite of mine), Terriyaki, Goyza and Seaweed Salads to name a few.  The size of the rolls for the price is unbeatable.  Granted they are not using the most expensive cuts of fish but it is generally decent (including their sashimi).  The specials they are offer (including the 24/7 happy hour) is truly unbeatable for a sushi restaurant.  This is probably the best valued sushi meal you will find in the East Valley.  The decor on the inside is modern and trendy.  It's a welcoming atmosphere for more of a casual spot but without being overly cliche for a "sushi" bar.  I also like the projector outside.  The service is always friendly and efficient.  I enjoy the instant miso and salad as well as the awesome desert at the end of every meal.  The family that runs the restaurant appear to be quite friendly as well.  I have to say that as a local resident I will continue to frequent Masa for as long as I live here.

I had been curious about this place since it is near my neighborhood.  The odd thing was they had these drapes covering the windows so the buisness never really looked open!  I had a friend who recently tried the place and advised me to stay away.  They went for breakfast and were dumbfounded by the lack of breakfast items and baked goods.  I was originally excited since it was advertised as a bakery but it's a shame if there offerings continue to be limited.  Rather just stick to the coffee house at Agritopia.

Noticed that this restaurant had changed hands yet again.  It's close to where we live so we decided to stop by for lunch one day.  First, the interior was remodeled pretty nicely.  You can tell they had a budget but I thought it was well done, very modern interior.    Service was spectacular.  To be honest, the reason why I gave them four stars was for how nice the owners/ staff were.  You can tell that they were trying to make a good impression to new guests and it definitely worked.  We ordered off the "lunch special" menu.   A lot of food for five bucks.  We had chicken & vegetables and orange chicken with a chicken satay app.  The Satay was a little dry and the peanut sauce had curry in it, not what im sue to but it was ok.  The main dishes were not bad for Americanized Chinese food.  You can tell the orange glaze on the orange chicken was more of a homemade marmalade which was a nice surprise.  The crab ragoons and egg wrongs were not bad either.  I would definitely come back to try their more authentic choices such as their Pho.  I'm guessing the family is Vietnamese so i should try to stick those items on the menu.  Overall we will be back.  Best of luck to them.

Absolutely disgusting.  Microwavable food.  Swindles you to pay for something that you didn't order.  False Advertising.   Avoid at all costs!

The folks who run this place seem nice....however, I was in line at SAMs Club and noticed that this is where they buy their bagels and ham.  Nothing against Sams Club.  It's just I might as well make my own bagel sandwiches at home..
