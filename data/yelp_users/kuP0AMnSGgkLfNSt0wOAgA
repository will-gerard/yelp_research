Cruise the strip...pass by McD's, Jack in the Box, Del Taco, etc...etc... Everyone's hungry...pointing fingers at this place and that place... Until the majority points four fingers at a Dennys...  They coulda dropped me off at those other places n picked me up later They ordered breakfast.... looked tasty... I ordered a double cheeseburger combo for breakfast..   I git these two huge clumps of meat patties inside the bun..   I tossed one patty to the side...   Burger was dry n tasteless and gross. Fries were soft..  I like my fries burnt a crispy I got pieces of burnt hash brown from my friend's plates and a muffin

It's an OK place.. The buffet wasn't all that great The steak place across from the buffet is delicious. Our room had a two inch space under the entrance door where we could hear all the noise in the hallway.

I really enjoyed my stay at the Stratosphere    We had a magnificant time here at this hotel and of course the first thing we did, is hit that elevator baby and off to the top to enjoy that spectacular view.    Wow, you walk to the edge...and there is a glass floor and you can look down and see the street.      We had some drinks at the Top of the World restaurant....mine was a 7up...waiter probably thought I was real cheap......well...sometimes I am....     The restaurants are OK and we watched people going and coming from the rides..some scared...   I wasn't really interested in that....     The rooms are OK and there like any other room on the casino strip.  The restaurants were good...but I actually like to look around Las Vegas Boulevard, eat at fancy restaurants.....

This place holds a lot of events and we enjoyed the luxury huge reception halls that they have.    This is a wonderful place and always packed with people....but you do have to do a lot of footwork to get where you have to go...     I like to go on the tours of Grand Canyon...etc...

Flamingo???  WOW...I'm impressed Upgraded room was awesome!   -I wanted a room near bottom floor .  I get a room so high up that I needed an oxygen bottle.   Paid all that money to come here, lay down and watch a Big Plazma TV,  in  redocrated rooms, with two huge beds....    -Off to the pool where they have a fascinating water slide.  Went down it a hundred times sliding almost off the edges....wheeeee.. feeling my backbone crack one way and then crack back into place several times.  -Swwiiisssh into the water....landing upside down..aaaaah...air...I need air...gasp....gasp....   -In the casino... ....      I hear the sounds of ching ching ching ching...  Such an enticing addictive tempting sound.   I'm glad I don't gamble. -My friends wallets come out.  Soon, they  drop in $$$!      YaY... awe... YaY...YaY....awe....Yay....awe.. More $$$!  YaY....YaY.... YaY.... awe....awe... ooooh....ouch... awe.. awe....   Enough watching this...  Off I go to bed. See ya guys tomorrow.    I guess I'll be paying for their breakfast!

We love to check out all the things here in Las Vegas..  We love to pig out at all the fancy high class restaurants too...       Well...why not enjoy yourselves like the high rollers for a night or two...duuuuh..     Then, of course....my bright idea...I ask my friend to go on this helicopter ride...   It was like trying to bathe a cat..   He finally gave in..when I said, I'd pay for it....aaaah, what  are friends for...right?     That helicopter ride was cool, and  we got a great tour down the strip and back...       I think we were short-changed a little...because it wasn't really that long for the money..   Shoulda deducted one star for short flight...but...Oh well......         The pilot was cool.....just our money dissappeared in thin air...

Where else can you touch a real live bear, a lion or a moose and still have your hand back.   Well...I guess...they're...not to much alive...  Rather they are temporally asleep...stuffed away in poor animal lala land.       I felt the back of my head slapped and looked around and saw a bear's face...  Hmmm....that was weird.... So I approached it slowly...and..stared at it a little puzzled...and...then I hear my friends laughing..      My crazy prankster friends were playing dumb jokes on me with a fishing pole and the line was touching my head.        Great animal kingdom here....and be able to look at animals you've never been able to see before....  But they're dead.       Went to the live fish tank..saw huge fish.     I want one of everything.  Fishing rods and gear  for all your needs. Clothing of every kind.  Some pricy...some cheap...     I love the little shooting range that they have (see another yelper's photo).  Darn rifles are a rip off. Ripped off  two dollars of mine and sights are off.     They do have an awesome waterfall (my photo)!

Starved yes...  They gave me a  hoof off of a steer!  You call this Prime Rib?  It's a dried up piece of meat...harder then beef jerky....  Not even close to Prime Rib...  It needs dozens of Au Jous to soften this rock hard prime rib. And...quit calling this hoof....prime rib... I guess eating food in Vegas is like gambling with your tummy.  Maybe something might be good in here...  But...I suggest you use your stomach to find out.  My stomach is out for temporary repairs...

Dry tasteless salmon.  And...we waited 20 minutes for this  fish, without any drinks...because the waitress forgot what we ordered.      Gosh and I  was so starved after the long drive, and this place appeared to look good.    Nice waitress...but she forgot everything everyone ordered several times.  She forgot the drinks and silverwear.  I used the silverware from another table.
