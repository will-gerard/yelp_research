Great food and friendly counter staff.  This is perfect for an early run into work and craving Mexican food.  I got the chorizo burrito and it was perfect.

I had an incident that I enlisted Michael's help for.  I was being treated unfairly and he recognized this from the minute I spoke with him.  Long story short I got a slightest degree DUI for having only a couple of light beers.  I passed all the field sobriety tests and they still charged me.  The DPS and Phoenix police can ruin your life and will take advantage of those who don't know the system. Throughout his representation he conveyed that I was not guilty.  He is extremely confident and well versed in his profession.  He seemed to have an innate ability to predict the actions of the court and prosecutor.  This proved effective when they would not budge on a plea offer that would have been devastating to my future.  I know that behind the scenes he put a lot of pressure on the prosecutor to release me from the charges with a fair plea.  To my delight, only a few days before trial the State took the plea that Michael arranged.    He told me he didn't want me to "wimp out" and I'm glad I followed his advice.  This lawyer really cares and fights hard for his clients.  * After reading the below commenter's reviews I completely agree with her description.  He is incredibly fair with his fee.  He represented me on several occasions and I did not have to spend much of my own time since he took care of it on my behalf.  His communication is good so that I could reach him with text and phone.  His demeanor really goes a long way, not cocky or shady like many other lawyers.  Very honest and caring.    Highly Recommend if your concerned with your rights and freedom, don't hesitate to let him navigate through whatever situation you might be facing.  The relief he provided is indescribable!!!

Great price for an alignment.  Easy and quick service was provided.  I like that they did not try to add on any sales garbage and try to pressure unnecessary repairs.

Excellent staff, the guy who scheduled my appointment was meticulous with appointment reminders.  The other staff were friendly and professional.  I have a difficult prescription that seems to frustrate most other providers I have seen.  I saw Dr. Van Over who was extremely patient and friendly.  She didn't assume I knew about my vision because I have a complex history.  She carefully explained her opinion and options.  I will certainly return for the service.

Mediocre sandwiches.  To much bread and only a small amount of meat.  They don't even taste good at all, nothing special about them.  The Thai tea here is good and I've heard the same about the coffees, but I won't be eating here again.

I used to come here as a hungry college student going to ASU across the street.  Happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in.  They recently remodeled and changed the menu a bit.  The place is still as amazing as ever.  I only get one thing here, #59.  The beef is amazing and peanut crusting along with fried egg is incredible.  Friendly service and incredible Vietnamese.

Great carne asada burritos.  The fish taco/burritos are also on point.  The owner is incredibly friendly and gives personal service.  The food is affordable and extremely high quality.  I enjoy coming here for consistent good tasting Mexican, best in the area.  Skip 'bertos and come here instead for an authentic taste.

I just bought my first pair of "real" running shoes here.  I wanted to make sure that I was going to be in a good fit for an upcoming half marathon.  This will be my first long distance run so it's important to me to have comfortable running wear.  The stride analysis and staff recommendations made this a pain free experience.  I also love that the pricing is affordable, I am a die-hard Amazon shopper and saw that they were the same price online.  Great selection and friendly service, definitely a good choice for avid runners.

$4.25 for a slice?  No lunch specials either.  Mediocre service.  Bland pizza.  Nothing to great here.

Did some great shots for my graduation and a new business profile picture.  Very charismatic, humorous and easy to work with.  Makes you feel like you're a guest in his home.  Thanks!

Fantastic customer service and quality of repair.  I brought my car here after a collision with a Geico policy holder.  This was the recommended provider, to my delight the rental car agent was in-house, and the adjuster also located in their office.  How easy!  Within a few minutes of dropping it off I had a rental car and was on my way.  Just a few days later, substantial damage was completely repaired.  I loved that they went above and beyond with helping me with a special request.  They've invited me back for an additional correction and were completely accommodative and supportive.  Thank you for making my car look better then it started off before the accident.  Seriously this place is perfect!

Had a snowboarding accident where I heard a audible pop.  Fast forward 6 months and a visit to an ortho surgeon.  He recommended PT, granted i'm in my 20's and my visual of PT is old people walking on a treadmill or doing stretches.  I visited their Gilbert office and it is full of young therapists and the office is really well kept.  They tailor to sports injuries so I didn't feel weird having my issue resolved.  After only a few weeks my shoulder was 100%.  They did an amazing job getting me back to my pre injury self.

Because I failed to realize my insurance didn't have the "full glass" I was quoted for a full price replacement through safelite for 230+  Feeling a little resentful about the insurance situation I always noticed these guys advertised windshield replacements and got a friendly quote that was much less.  Throughout the process they showed me existing damage to my coweling plastic as full disclosure.  They even were careful enough by asking about stickers etc.  Very good attention to detail and extremely friendly  I'll be coming back if the need arises.

If your going to expect customers to praise your restaurant when two guests are standing in the front it might help for someone to acknowledge us.  Waiting 5 minutes at front and had no greeting.  Then proceeded to take our own menus into the dining area where we noticed about 6 other tables eating.  We sat down waiting for a server to greet us.  One of the servers on the side looked at us and walked into the back.  After waiting another 5 minutes we left the restaurant.  Don't think I'll be coming back.

Great sushi options, attentive service.  The edamame and miso soup are to die for.

This was my spot in Seattle.  I loved being able to get a soup or pastry and enjoying the fireplace on cold damp days.    The ambience here is equally as welcoming.  Clean and cozy eating area.  I would agree with the rest of the reviews, the staff seems to be poorly trained and confused on the menu.  Even I have a hard time understanding the "pick 2" options.  When I went it was empty, I got my food quickly.  It seems that they are trying to figure things out still with the food delivery as the runners get confused easily.  I got the chipotle cheddar sandwich which was good.  My main complaint was that for $13 it seems overpriced for a tiny sandwich and salad.    I'll come back for coffee and pastries but not the food.  Slightly better, but overpriced paradise cafe.
