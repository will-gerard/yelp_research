I got a haircut here, and would love to give it more than a 4 star, but my haircut was a simple trim which is easy for any stylist. For the most part, it was a decent experience for the price I paid, but I wonder how great of a haircut I would receive if I cut my hair in a more detailed and intricate way.  It's a more dated salon, but friendly service nonetheless. Unique is a sweetheart, and very personable. I would probably give it a second try for another trim if I could receive the same discounted price, but wouldn't pay more than that for a simple trim.

You always get the best food from a tiny little place that doesn't look like much. We came to Adrian's today after reading the Yelp reviews and the food was truly incredible! I have a really hard time finding truly authentic Mexican food in Mesa, mostly because the food caters to the tender palettes of the snow birds.  This place packs a powerful punch of flavour into everything they make.  It's a tiny little place with only 4 tables in it, and a constant flow of patrons. Be prepared to take it to go if you can't get a table, but don't leave without ordering food if you're disappointed about not getting a seat.  My husband had the carne asada burrito, and for the first time, I tasted what a carne asada SHOULD taste like. Man was it good! Excellent grilled flavour with amazing herbs and spices built in for layers of flavour.  I had the green chile burrito, enchilada style. Full of meat, and the sauce was worthy of plate-licking. I added jalape√±o to mine, as I love the heat. It was the first time I felt I had satisfied my inner craving for truly authentic Mexican food. We had it for lunch and I am still wonderfully full and it's almost dinner time.  We will absolutely be back. Probably sooner than my husband knows! I can't wait to try the other dishes.  They also make killers breakfasts. Large portions and low prices.  These are the little shops we need to keep supporting! You won't regret coming here.

From the moment we arrived at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, we were treated like 6-star clients. The check in process was smooth, professional and efficient. We chose to stay in a Casita Suite as it was our 1 year wedding anniversary. We were hoping for a very romantic, private, and comfortable luxury suite, and we certainly were not disappointed. Upon arriving at our room, we were very impressed with the quality of furnishings and style of the casita suite. It was lavish. Very private, overlooked TPC golf course, had a private veranda, a large living room with a fireplace, a large bedroom, large bathroom with a walk-in closet, large soaker tub, dual vanities, a safe, lush robes, it was beautiful.   We then called the front desk to see if there was a bell boy available to drive us around on a golf cart to explore the entire resort and see where the facilities were. Within 4 minutes, a gentleman named Dan was at our door to take us on a drive.  He was wonderful. Fun, informative, even picked a few oranges off the trees in the garden for us to enjoy. So far, the experience was great! The gardens on the property were beautiful, fragrant, and filled with roses. The pools were beautiful, plenty of chairs, very clean with nice fireplaces and bars outside.  There are gorgeous ponds on the property with Christmas lights and displays, and natural wildlife enjoying themselves. The grounds were very meticulously kept and beautiful.   Next, we enjoyed a dip in the private casita pool and hot tub, which had plenty of towels and comfortable chairs to lounge in, as well as a beautiful outdoor fireplace. Note: There is bar service at the larger pools, but not at the Casita pool.   That night, we enjoyed some drinks at the outdoor bar near the large Christmas trees. The outdoor area had a private fireplace per table to keep you warm. Great service, great drinks, great top shelf alcohol choices. Everything we really like, we were able to enjoy.  We returned that evening to a wonderful surprise in our room. We received a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice from the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess with a card congratulating us on our anniversary! What a wonderful thing to come back to! This was icing on the cake! We also called the front desk to ask if turndown service was included in the package we purchased, which was not, and that was just fine with us. But, after 20 seconds of hanging up the phone, we received a call back from the front desk stating that we will indeed be receiving a complimentary turn-down service, courtesy of the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess! WOW! We were beyond impressed!  We ordered breakfast in bed the next morning, and although expensive, the breakfast came at the exact time we had pre-ordered it for, and it was hot and delicious! We both had the Eggs Benedict and it was perfectly cooked.  We enjoyed our complimentary bottle of champagne with the fresh oranges, and our breakfast in bed. Great way to start our anniversary day!  Thank you Fairmont Princess!   After hanging out at the Well & Being Spa (see my review for that) we decided to check out the roof top pool (co-ed with bar & food service).  The pool area was gorgeous, very clean, quiet. The bartender, Tyler, was friendly and welcoming, and very professional. He offered to make us a bloody mary. Although drinks up there are about $15 each, I couldn't resist the sound of a bloody mary. I am so glad I said yes because this was by far the BEST bloody mary I had ever had in my entire life! (And I am quite picky) Extra spicy, with actual chopped jalapeno in it, 2 large olives, absolutely perfect.  We had a few more of those, and seeing as it was so slow up there, we started getting to talking with Tyler. He enticed us with a taster of this, a taster of that, we ordered more drinks, and ended up having an absolute blast with Tyler. We told him it was our anniversary, and the next thing we know, he had 2 huge beautiful pieces of chocolate cake delivered to us pool side, again compliments of the Fairmont!  We cannot say how above and beyond Tyler went in making our anniversary experience at the roof top pool something we will always cherish! He really did not have to put in the effort he did, but because he did, it will be one of the reasons we will return for future anniversaries.  The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess from check in to check out, was a 6 start experience, and I must say, has ensured our return for every anniversary going forward. The Fairmont knows how to treat their clients. We have stayed at many 5 star Scottsdale resorts, and many luxury resorts around the world, and this was by far the best experience we have ever had at any price level we have paid. Thank you Fairmont Scottsdale Princess. Your level of attention to detail, professionalism, luxury offerings, and the simple "know how to treat your clients" has been greatly appreciated and noted.  You made our first wedding anniversary absolutely perfect! We would not have changed

A hole in the wall? Literally.  The most authentic tasting Mexican food I've had? Yes. Alcohol? Nope. Walk-up ordering board? Yup. I love small family run restaurants for this exact reason. You find the gem and you support it.  The food is wonderful. Punch full of flavours.  This is also the first (of 5 I've been to in 2 weeks here in AZ) that serves you chips and salsa where the chips are actually freshly made and served hot!  The customer service was genuine and so very friendly.  The food? Exactly what I was missing. I've been looking for that genuine taste, and I finally found it.  Every bite delivered.

The absolute best pedicure I have ever had. Ask for Tara. All pedicures at this salon come with a (COMPLIMENTARY) very lovely leg and foot massage, then a hot stone massage, then.... after your toes are painted, they give you a quick should massage! For $23, I will come here once a week! Tara is the best, although I read on other Yelp reviews that Tony gives a wonderful massage as well. I personally will only ask for Tara as she smiled happily the entire time she worked on me, and she gave the best massage I have ever had during any pedicure I have every had in my entire life! What a wonderful little place.  Please make appointments though people. It is only courteous to do so. This place gets busy. I DID make an appointment, and 12 people came in to wait during my pedicure, and they did NOT rush me out of my chair! So amazing. I have been rushed before and had my treatment cut short at other salons when walk-in's come in, but not this place. If you have an appointment, you are smart, and will not be rushed when the other people come in.

Anniversary dinner:  Reservations at Bourbon Steak.  We were promptly greeted at Bourbon Steak with a card signed by all of the staff, congratulating us on our anniversary. Great welcome! We were then seated at a private romantic table and were waited on by Justin. He was extremely professional, and welcomed us for our anniversary. We started with some cocktails, recommended to our likings by Justin. They were hand-crafted and wonderful. Exactly in tune with our likes and preferences.  We ordered our meal, and were surprised when Chef Jeremy McMillian decided to spoil us with multiple tastings from the kitchen, courtesy of Bourbon Steak. One after the other, we were greeted by exquisite single portion tastes of the finest foods we have eaten, creations with a depth of thought and emotion put into each concoction. Each tasting was a new experience to savour in its own creative explosion of flavour. In fact, it was such a meal to remember, we asked Justin, our server, to email us what we had eaten.   Our incredible meal was as follows, and a very big personal thank you to Chef Jeremy McMillian:  Amuse 1:  Trio of Duck Fat Fries  Ranch fry with fancy sauce. Bacon fry with BBQ sauce, Old Bay fry with Tartar Sauce  Amuse 2: Wild Mushroom Arinchini w/ Pecorino Fondue  Appetizer: Fresh Hand pulled Mozzerella Salad w/ Poached pear, Shaved Speck (smoked Prosciutto), and arugula  Entree:  Mixed Grill w/ Two Wash Ranch Guinea Hen, Prime "Coulotte" Sirloin, Prime Rib Cap, and Prime NY "Pave"  Dessert:  Apple Financier w/ almond cake and Butter Ice Cream   It was a dining experience that will not be soon forgotten. We eat at many 5 star restaurants from Vancouver to Seattle to Scottsdale, and in between, and this was one of our very top experiences to date, from the level of professional service, to the quality and creativity of the food. It left no room for disappointment in any category.   We then returned to our room, enjoyed a scotch in front of the cozy fireplace, took a bubble bath in the giant tub in our suite, and retreated to bed.   The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess from check in to check out, was a 6 star experience, and I must say, has ensured our return for every anniversary going forward. The Fairmont knows how to treat their clients. We have stayed at many 5 star Scottsdale resorts, and many luxury resorts around the world, and this was by far the best experience we have ever had at any price level we have paid. Thank you Fairmont Scottsdale Princess. Your level of attention to detail, professionalism, luxury offerings, and the simple "know how to treat your clients" has been greatly appreciated and noted.  You made our first wedding anniversary absolutely perfect! We would not have changed a single thing!

I guess I have to go against the grain and write a fair review giving it only 2 stars.  We had the Tennessee platter, consisting of pulled pork and country ribs. The pulled pork was ok, but the country ribs were more fat than meat. Not the most appetizing thing. Very heavy and greasy.  The meat comes dry with a bowl of bbq sauce to dip in.  They offer 'endless' sides, which is great value. The fried okra and the coleslaw were the best. The Mac & cheese was rather bland but did come with little pieces of bacon in it. We also had the cowboy beans which were probably the worst tasting out of the sides we ordered.  The service was good, friendly and casual atmosphere.  It definitely was not a 4 star according to many reviewers. We were disappointed for sure.

The bruschetta board and Kalamata sandwich are absolutely 5 stars. The Belice sandwich, not great.  The kids menu turkey sandwich is a great value. Nice turkey sandwich that comes with chips and a cookie. The prices are high, but the quality is there, can't complain when I pay for quality.  We will be back to try more menu items.  The beer and wine is rather expensive for regular types of beer and wine.  There is a happy hour from 4-7pm where they have a dollar off beer and wine, and have pizza specials. I imagine their pizzas would be pretty good simply based on the quality of meats and cheeses they use in their sandwiches, although we have not yet tried them.

Love love love this place! We usually stay in hotels after the Cardinals games, and we usually stayed at the Mariott or Hampton in the Glendale entertainment district, but we discovered this hotel by accident after the last game, and went in to see if there was a room available. They greeted us with a warm cookie and a room ready! Out of all the hotels that we normally stay at, this hotel far surpasses them all. It's super clean, the beds are actually VERY comfy, and they offer free wifi AND a free HOT breakfast!  Although it is a five minute drive from the University of Phoenix Stadium, we will be staying at this hotel for every game going forward. It's a total gem! The customer service is outstanding (Matt is the best) and the prices are hard to beat!  We will only use this hotel now!

It's never been a great place, but it's unfortunately gotten worse. We had the American Standard burgers which were possibly the most greasy burgers either of us have had from any joint we've been to.  It oozed out of the burger and ran down our hands and forearms.  Also, if you want lettuce, tomatoes, onions or pickles which are expected to come automatically with your burger, you have to ask for it.  We had the appy of boneless chicken tenders which had maybe 40% breast meat. The sauce was hot, pretty good.  We will not be back.

Pretty decent pedicure for $20. There are different levels of pedicures that last longer, have paraffin wax, etc, for more money, but I just did the basic spa pedicure for $20. Even with the $20 one, you get a nice leg massage and hot stone massage. The pedicure was fast, faster than I'm used to, and then I got a gel polish on my hands for $15. They took me in with no appointment, and the results were nice, but if you want a deep scrub on your feet, and dead skin removal, and a lasting long massage and pampering, I would choose a more expensive pedicure.  I'll be back, and will try a more expensive pedicure for a more pampering experience.

Had a family get-together here, and while the food tasted good, the pain I suffered throughout the night afterwards was not worth it. I had stomach and gut pain like knives in my guts. All night.  The service was also very slow. Plates should have been cleared, drinks brought, very slow. I personally won't be back.

My favourite food in the entire world is Indian food, and I like to think of myself as one of the connoisseurs of Indian food.  I travel specially to find the best Indian food. This place is a gem. We had the lunch buffet, and had tons of items to choose from . The sauces were all so authentic and creamy and spicy and yummy, depending on each dish. They even offer mango lassi at the buffet to cleanse your palette.  The staff here were actually better than some of the 5-star restaurants my husband and I go to.  I have to say, this is food that everyone regardless of race or taste will love, there will be something for you that will make you want to return.  Well done!

Fresh, wonderful, sustainable food sourced. The menu changes from spring to fall. The wait staff was wonderful and attentive.  The chicken sausage pizza is a must, and the bison burger is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten in my life! I ordered it medium rare which most people would order medium, but I am a bison lover and eat carpaccio very often, so a little pink doesn't scare me. It was melting in my mouth.  We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and I must say, delish!!!! We will be back.

I was really looking for a strong margarita and didn't find it here. The first sip was, but that was all..  The food is rather generic. Nothing really stood out to me here. The service was very slow, had to wave someone down to get another drink.  It's typical Mexican fare. No real authentic flare outside if the Mexican music blaring.  Won't be back. It wasn't terrible, it just didn't stand out as anything to come back for.

A restaurant of Scottsdale caliber here in Mesa. Wow. This place is a total gem. I am so happy we found it!  If you want great food in an upscale place, and don't want to leave Mesa, this is the place!  You can sit in the lounge, at the sushi bar, or at a teppanyaki table.  We sat in the lounge, but saw through a window the teppanyaki side of the restaurant. That is an absolute blast!! The chefs all seem to be extremely entertaining, while being exceptional chefs! We are definitely doing that next time. Hilarious. Especially if there's a birthday... they'll bring a dragon head out and put it on the birthday person, and sing an awesome birthday song. Even we were clapping along. Such a good time! The bartender is fantastic! Rachel pours a mean drink! Happy hour is a absolute bargain for this place. They have $2 domestic beer, or very cheap drinks and food suring happy hour. On Tuesdays, they have $1 saki.  I can't believe how excellent the food is here. The sushi is the best I've had in Arizona, beating Kona Grill and everywhere else we've eaten in Scottsdale easily. We are definitely going to be regulars here.  I can't say enough how exceptional this place is. We will be back again and again and again!

My husband and I found this place 2 weeks ago, and have eaten here 5 times since! This is the best Chinese food in ALL of Arizona.  Family owned, purely authentic and every dish is made with love and passion for food. If I could give it 7 stars, I would. I have eaten at the top restaurants in 2 countries and this little place is an absolute gem.  Love love love!!!

Plate-licking worthy.  Another gem. Truly authentic and wonderfully priced. Lovely family-run restaurant that truly deserves 5 full stars.  I see why they take reservations because there are maybe 10 tables, and they get filled up quickly. You can choose your level of hot too. Mild, medium, hot, extra hot, and Thai hot. My husband ordered the Thai hot and it was phenomenal if you like heat! I ordered the extra hot and wished I would have ordered Thai hot, but be aware, I eat hot sauce on everything.  I will definitely be back to this place.

Well, last time we came here, about 8 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars easily. Great burgers, everything was grass-fed beef, great happy hour prices, great atmosphere. Today, we came here after eagerly anticipating Ingo's, and it was disappointing. Now, it's $1.00 extra for grass-fed beef, and we were totally rushed by the waitress. We wanted to relax, have a few drinks, then order, but we were continually pestered to order, even though there were a ton of empty tables. We had the shattered fries, which were far greasier than usual, and we had the Farmer's Daughter burger and the Paris, Texas burger. Neither burger was worth writing home about. After 2 drinks and our burgers, our waitress just came and placed the bill on our table without even asking us if we wanted anything else. Totally killed the experience.  Food... Not nearly as good as it used to be. Drinks.. Greyhound is great but is $8 Waitress? Terrible.  Unfortunately, we won't make the trip here again when there are far better places to enjoy a few drinks and food in a much better and relaxed atmosphere.

Good burgers but the "sides" are sized for babies... 2 bites and you're done. Mac n cheese is blah. Nothing great there, I find the velveeta macaroni from the grocery store is better.  The best thing was the Texas Sweet Tea. Service is good. Food mediocre. Same caliber as Red Robin.
