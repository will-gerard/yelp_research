Dr fetchel is awesome. I've been seeing them for two years and may be off migraine meds soon if the migraines don't come back.

I have been impressed with dr Wilson. He is easy to talk to and listens. I did not feel rushed at the appointment and he gave me all my options so I could make an informed decision on how to proceed to get better. He even called the day before a surgery to see how I was doing and that he would be there the next day.

I have been here several times, it is close to my work. Always get me right in and the staff is friendly and the prices are average. They let me know when I need a new battery, windshield wipers, tires, air filter etc.

Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a "wellness plan". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a hospital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health.

I spoke to one of owners Shane, this morning who refused to cancel my credit card transaction that I submitted to through the website and the one closest to me was not listed so the order went to the wrong one. I was told to contact Subway immediately and you can only email so I did. I also called the store and they said to call back in 10 minutes to have a chance to ask the "manager's manager." I did and they said to come in within 24 hours and she (the I store manager) will refund it. I get an email the next day from Subway saying it is up to the store and I also get a call from Shane who says they threw out the sandwich and got charged to run my card so they would lose money so they cannot refund it. He said they called 45 mins after it was made to see if I was picking it up which they did not. I told him now I have to dispute it through my credit card company In 4 days if it posts. If I was on this side of town I'd rather go to Jersey Mikes with fresh sliced meat, cheese, and AMAZING bread (it is across the street near Teharu sushi (and inexpensive) which is also very good).

The girls that work there are so nice and helped me find food for my sick cat and neighbors.

This location is not up to Starbucks standards. I asked for a refill on my passion tea and the response was "did you just get in the drive through because if so I can't do a refill. I said no, I got it at another location much earlier today but I'll just get a water. .she said ok venti? I said yes and I'll also get a veggie breakfast sandwhich." I handed her my gift card and debit card to reload it. I said I have a coupon code and I had to repeat it twice. She could have just asked if I got my drink in a drive through and gave me the discount for having the same cup and listened for the code better or ask to see it on my phone to get it right. My breakfast sandwhich was cold in the middle and the guy before me got bacon and was asked if that is what he ordered. He said no I thought I ordered...and it was as different one and not the one I ordered. This location is always hiring. Maybe they were new but it seemed more like a lack of customer service skills. I wonder where the supervisor was during all of this. These people need training and the supervisor should have corrected the mistakes on the spot.

I have been taking my car here for years. Employees and owner are friendly and answer all my questions. Prices are good. I have referred them to my friends. They don't try to sell you on things you don't need.

As a manager of payroll at our insurance company, I forward payroll details to Paul and he emails paystubs and direct deposits our paychecks to our bank accounts. With commissions and our paid time off policy, payroll can get complex and he explains things in a way that makes sense. Paul is detailed and I trust him to get back to me in a timely manner.

Great to know my car was fixed right the first time and to find a shop nearby that I can trust. Leo explained what was wrong and pricing. He was friendly and let me know what was needed. They were able to diagnose the problem, get the parts, and get my car fixed all the same day!
