My dad was treated for his NASH liver disease here for a brief period before we switched over to Mayo Clinic. Thank God we did. This hospital is way worse than Banner Desert in Mesa. After stints at 4 different hospitals in the valley, we were least satisfied with the care at this one. Go elsewhere if you have the option.

Cute little brewing company with yummy food and good beers. Not your typical brewery, but that's why I like it. Service was good, and the place was chill. They had awesome sweet potato fries, and good choices of cider and beers.

This hospital took great care of my father when he was diagnosed with cirrhosis and again when we brought my 6 month old in with a 104.2 fever.  Both were admitted for a week and all the staff we encountered were extremely caring and professional. The nurses and doctors were very gentle with my baby girl and took great care of my dad. I also love the pediatric icu. Lots of cool things for kids to do and look at when they get sick. Great hospital. So much better than Shea!!!

I am finicky and picky. I don't really like buffets. I find the foods usually old, stale, bland...etc. But not this place. The food turns over quickly, it's warm, its clean, there is a huge assortment of food, the salad bar is fresh, the lettuce is crispy. It's actually the best buffet I've ever eaten at, with the exception of maybe the pricier vegas ones.  Way better than any others in the valley.

Pretty good for quick asian food. I am a big fan of their miso and hot and sour soup. The prices are fair and the portions are okay. The crab angels are delicious and they have pretty decent chicken teriyaki. I like their low carb bowls too!

I am addicted to wings. I eat them Once or twice a week and have eaten them  all over the valley. I have to say these are probably the best wings I've ever had. I love hot wings, but the honey hot here far surpasses the hot. They're crispy, but not overly so, and the sauce is crazy good. I've never eaten in the restaurant, because I always take them to go..but don't be fooled by the hole in the wall appearance. These are amazing wings!

So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft. Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat! Lots of sugar free flavors too! Mmm!

I could eat the turkey subs here everyday if I could. One of the best subs I've ever had...and I eat them pretty frequently. The half sub is only 3.50, which is pretty cheap in my book.  This is family owned, so you always get greeted with a smile and a hello. Quick service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they only take cash, they close at 3 and are closed on Sundays and for weeks in the summer, which for me is a little troublesome..But I gaurantee the food makes up for it!!

This place is way overpriced for what it is. I grew up on lox stock and it used to be one of my favorite places!!! The bagels were amazingly soft and delicious. Now that the old owners are gone, the bagels are hard and the cream cheese tubs we ordered to go were moldy! We were having a huge family breakfast and by the time we got home Lox stock was closed. Lame for the price we paid.

I've been going here my entire pregnancy and the staff is awesome. Dr. Mary Deka is a total sweetheart and makes sure you're happy and comfortable. She cares about her patients and is very knowledgeable as are the nurse practitioners I've had to see when Deka is out delivering a baby. The office is really nice and quiet.  The only thing is the wait can be a little bit overboard sometimes. I've waited up to an hour to see my doctor. Not so great when you have other things to do afterwards or somewhere to be.

Ate here in the early afternoon. Boyfriend got a breakfast burrito, I got a shredded beef burrito. His was dripping some weird watery greasy crap..mine made me sick instantly after. Unless I'm eating bean and cheese burritos from here late at night..I'll pass. Why not just go to Amado's or Filly B's?

I can't say enough good things about Casa Reynoso. I just wished I had known about it earlier! It's tucked in the corner of a Fry's strip mall, so for an entire year we never even noticed it was there. I'm so glad we found it, because it really is a little gem. I love the green chili chimi and there 4.00 Margaritas are awesome. The family that owns this place are always there and are SO nice. They love to talk and will recommend all the goods.  Kids are also extremely welcome here. This is just a great little Mexican place with awesome service, yummy food, and a decent atmosphere.  We love it!

Seriously... every city in America should be equipped with at least 5 QT's. I have caught myself on more than one occasion raving to friends in other cities about them, and while realizing I must sound completely ridiculous, I'm also realizing they haven't gotten to experience a QuickTrip! I love that they offer fresh brewed iced tea, huge cup sizes, 3 different kinds of ice, a million types of sodas, amazing coffee drinks, yummy individual iced cakes, and cheap gas. Their milkshakes and smoothies are my favorite though.

Gotta love Pizza Mart! This place looks really ghetto outside, but it's an oldschool gem on the inside. The pizza is yummy and for 5.00 you really can't beat it. Lots of old arcade games. They also have a salad bar, but it's nothing special. All in all a  great place to get a cheap pizza, beer, and ice cream.

I love this Fry's and come in almost daily to buy something. Most of the employees are always super friendly and will go above and beyond if something goes wrong. There are a few older women that work in customer service that could be better and their job, but the other employees make up for it. On more than one occasion I have come in and received free flowers, samples, stickers, candy and balloons for my daughter just for shopping here.  It's always clean and the store is always set up nicely. It's a great Fry's.

This is the worst Walmart Neighborhood Market out of any of them. Horrible customer service. None of the employees know what they're doing, they're slow, and they don't have enough people working even on their busiest days. Expect a line at any given time. Don't even try to price match here, because even if you are right and the ad says so, they will find a reason to say no. I've gotten spilled meat from the deli twice. I loathe this place so much.

Totally not my favorite place to go. The sandwiches aren't that good. They're really expensive and don't even come with any sides. Most of them are bland.  I've been conned into eating here a couple of times, and everytime I'm pissed afterwards that I had to spend 15 dollars on something I didnt even really enjoy and could have gotten for 6 dollars elsewhere.

This place is not that great. Shogun express has way better chicken teriyaki rice bowls and beyond. The chicken is what really bothered me here. It was really tough and extremely chewy. And that was the white meat. They're bowls are around 5 bucks which I like, but they're not even filled to the top.  All in all I came here because Shogun was closed and there aren't any other rice bowl places in Scottsdale that I know of. Eh.

Don't do it. Don't even think about moving here.  It's not safe, it's not nice to look at, parking sucks, and the management is awful. Our laundry room flooded on several occasions and getting maintenance to come by was an absolute struggle. The water was turned off at 8am-11am on 3 different occasions without warning. So when it was time for us to be up and showering for work, we couldn't even brush our teeth!! My car got towed in regular uncovered parking for having the tags two weeks expired.  One week from moving out a guy got pistol whipped by the dumpsters where everyone has to park.  I'm pretty sure I've made my point, so I'll stop before a vein pops out of my head from having to think about this hell-hole.

Came here on Christmas eve because of all the hype. The price is an upsale restaurant, but the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is like a musty old sports bar. I didnt think anything was great about the place. Reminded me of a cafeteria. There are far better restaurants in the valley for the price.

I am such a freak for this place.... Whenever I'm in the mood for fast and cheap, but don't want to sacrifice healthy choices, I always end up at Shogun. I can never decide between the Spicy chicken teryaki bowl or the Chicken caesar salad, both of which are quite delicious and under six dollars. It doesn't get better than that. MMMMM good.

One of my favorite sub places for sure. They have such an assortment of sandwiches, the subs are all toasted, and you can fix them up with whatever you want. Way more options than subway. The food and meats are fresh. The food doesn't even really compare to most sub shops. The only thing that sucks about this location is the seating. This place is really small, so it's only good for you and a friend, unless you want to sit on the wall bar.  I crave this place all the time though...so I go there often, despite the seating.

We love this Enterprise! We rented an economy car for 80 bucks for 4 days to take on our vacation to the coast. When we got to this location they had a Jeep Patriot ready for us. It ended up being an awesome upgrade and great on our trip. It wasn't filled up when we got there, but it was ok with us, because we didn't have to fill up when we brought it back. The guys here are super cool and they work quick and efficient. We'll definitely come back to this location every time we rent!

Yum, Yum, Yum. There are a hundred reasons you should love Oreganos. The food is delicious. They offer huge portions. Their salads are amazing and their pasta dishes are even better. The thin crust pizza is great to share. The staff is always attentive and super friendly. Other reasons include: The Pazooki - Vanilla ice cream a-top a huge steaming hot cookie. Belinnis - Frozen Peach schnapps, champagne, and chambord. Great atmosphere - old records and signs, oversized tables, frank sinatra playing overhead. A great patio with heaters in the winter and misters in the summer. Just don't go on a night you are super starving, because there is ALWAYS a wait at any of their locations and they don't take reservations!

I am a total carnivore, but I have dated around 6 vegans ...so needless to say I have been forced to eat a lot of food I wouldn't choose if I was eating by myself.  Let's face it...most vegan food sucks. It's plain, it looks unappetizing, and the fake meat tastes like chewy pieces of unflavored cardboard.   This isn't the case with the food at Green. It is DELICIOUS. A million different options all waiting to explode your taste buds.  I personally crave the Thai peanut bowl and Buffalo chicken wings on a weekly basis. The BBQ chicken sand which is amazing too. Don't under estimate this place. It wouldn't be as busy as it is, or stay open as long in AZ if it wasn't so incredibly yummy.

All I can say about Chuckbox is YUM. This is by far my favorite burger place in Arizona..maybe ever. I love the Tijuana Torpedo, which has a huge patty, green chiles and pepper jack cheese. I am a condiment whore, so having the option to pile my burger with whatever I want is a definite plus. By the time I'm done making my own burger, it's way too big to eat, so I have to dissect it into smaller portions..which is fun for me and highly entertaining for my friends. The only reason it doesn't deserve my 5th star is for ambiance and speed. If you're in a hurry, chuckbox might not always be the best option. But if you're in the mood for a juicy well cooked burger then go there.. now. and don't forget to stop by an ATM on the way, because this old school place only accepts cash.

Casey's is a great place to bring friends and relax outside. It's also great for a late night meal and a beer. Their food is pretty damn good and I highly enjoy their pear cider mixed with Guiness. Yum. It's always a nice change to be able to sit outside at tables, instead of cramped inside some dark bar. The only down sides to this place are it can get quite packed so you're out of a place to sit  for the night, and it can take a good 5-8 minutes to get a drink. At least they have two bars.......!

I love the crap out of Lee's. The turkey club with bacon on a huge soft home made croissant cannot be beat for 5 bucks. Seriously. They also give you peppers and a pickle on the side. You can buy an assortment of chips or desserts/pastries to go with your meal. Don't forget the boba smoothies. (Passion fruit!!) or different coffee drinks. I really wanted to try the Iced Latte..because it looked so good, but I went for the smoothie instead. I love boba. They also have a selection of different soda's and drinks. Jones and others.  You can even get gelato.  I loooove this place!

Yum yum yum! Not much to say that hasn't already been said about this place, but I'd start with the Thai Coffee and end with any of the dishes, because they've all got something to offer. I made the mistake of getting pad Thai the first time and although it was really good, it wasn't the star of the show (is it ever though?)  I love the peanut dressing at the salad bar and add it to everything because it's so freaking good!  This place gets busy for lunch even on the weekdays, so prepare for a small wait.

We love this dog park. It's always clean and well kept. The actual dog part is huge and there's lots of trees and some hills for dogs to roam around. There are also various toys and balls for the pups to play with. The people we've encountered there are really nice and social with the pups and others.  I also enjoy that there's a kids playground next door so we can hit up that one for my daughter while we're there!

Worst customer service ever. I Called and spoke to a lady asking about Holiday Pajamas this Fry's had for Christmas. When I asked about sizes, she said they were in the Christmas department, but didn't know what they had and that I could come in and look myself. I called a different department hoping someone would help me. They transferred me to the same lady and I got hung up on. Right before Christmas. Thanks Fry's.

Most honestly, one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Actually.. one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to!! The whole meal was delicious, right down to the salsa. In fact, the entire meal was filled with "mmmm's and ahhhh's!"  I was even kind of sad there wasn't one closer to Tempe, until our server informed us that the Burrito Shop on University is owned by the same people. Score!

I bought a Groupon for this place for a full exam, -xrays, whitening trays, and a cleaning. When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by the office staff, who are cheerful and sweet. The entire office is pretty big and really nice. Lots of magazines and Tv's..etc. As I went back, they told me they had to reschedule me for the cleaning and trays another da, because they were so busy. A little annoying, but sometimes these things happen.  I came back the following week and had my cleaning done and I am happy as a clam. The office wasn't nearly as busy, and it was actually pretty quiet. The staff is awesome and the woman who did my cleaning was wonderful! I felt totally relaxed and calm, which is necessary when you are getting things jabbed into your teeth and gums for an hour. My teeth look and feel awesome. Another woman took me back and did the impressions for my whitening tray. She was also really nice and bubbly. All in all I am totally happy with this place and will be returning next week to get a cavity filled.

Go somewhere else! Anywhere else! They didn't vacuum or throw away any of my trash. My car was the same as I left it with a little scent and the outside was clean. The inside was in the same shape as I left it. Save your 16 bucks and go elsewhere.

If you have a mustang (or other classic) this is the place to come. The guys in the back have been doing this for 20+ years and know what they're doing. For the people that said it takes a long time to get their car back, you should take your car to the regular corner shop down the street. If you want what's under your hood to actually look good, it's going to take longer than Joe Schmoe's auto repair.

This location has gone seriously downhill throughout the years. Sad, because the inside just got a facelift. Their vegetables (which I always get at Panda Express) are always soggy, thick, and gross. Their chicken is slimey. Most dishes look like they've been sitting for a long time and their staff is completely miserable. The one at Mesa riverview is so much better!!!

My friends devoured their burgers, the salads were really fresh and delicious, and the chicken salad sandwich was super yummy.  Also head to the coffee shop part where you can get the yummiest baked goods and coffee. (the cupcakes are soo good)

I've only been here once, but as far as that experience goes..it was amazing. We got the Rattlesnake, Little mermaid, Cinderella, & edamame. Everything was so so good. Especially for going in with zero expectations..(good sushi in az is just too hard to find) So many creative rolls, an extensive menu and the server was patient and sweet, even though we had a table of 12 + 2 Rowdy kids. $1 well drinks and $2.50 beers. The place plays music, but not too loudly.  Food is so much better than RA. Can't wait to go back again.

Ohhhh Maaaangos!!! I have been having a love affair with this place for about 10 years. It has NEVER let me down. The chips are homemade and always fresh and warm, the salsa is super delicious. My favorites are the Veggie and Shredded beef burritos, the nachos are also crazy good. The service is awesome, I love all the people that work there..and they've all been working there a super long time!  The drinks are huge. The food is fresh. I can't say enough good about this place... Just go and see for yourself!!

This used to be my favorite BBQ place. My family would all meet up to eat here every few weeks and we thoroughly enjoyed doing so, but the last two times we've gotten the same server who is a total killjoy. She completely ruins the experience for us. She says she is management, which makes me wonder what the owners of Waldo's are thinking. The last time we dined at Waldo's she accused my boyfriend (who is vegan) of sharing meals and wouldn't give our table any of the unlimited sides.  He came to drink an Iced Tea and enjoy the conversation, because clearly he can't share a meal that is chock full of meat. Even the beans have meat. C'mon. After we explained the situation, she proceeded to spend the next 5 minutes arguing with us, until the 6 of us decided to get to go boxes so we didn't have to deal with her anymore. She then tried to come back and explain that it wasn't her fault, but the owners policy and there were servers there who never follow those orders and we should fill out a comment card so they should be dealt with. (What?) We came to eat, not try to get others in trouble for not following the rules.   Besides that, she has a really bad attitude and acts like she hates her job, which is too bad because most of the other servers here are awesome.  It's safe to say we won't ever be dining here again, which I guess makes room for more enjoyable BBQ restaurants. Sorry Waldo's, worst experience I've ever had at a dining establishment.

I don't know why this place got such mediocre reviews?! I eat a lot of BBQ and have eaten it pretty much everywhere in the valley. I came here and got the usual pulled pork sandwich and potato salad. It was cheap...quite a bit cheaper than Scottsdale BBQ and a lot tastier. There is a Drive-thru here which I actually find awesome, so I can get quick BBQ lunches on the go...but it's still a sit down restaurant too. I've been here multiple times and always leave satisfied!

I don't understand any of the so-so reviews. This place is delicious and far surpasses any of the other cupcake places I've had in the PHX area. So much better than sprinkles.  The first time I experienced SL, I had almond raspberry, red velvet, and salted caramel. The sc was SO good.  Today we went for happy hour and got brandied chocolate truffle, lemon rose buttercream, and chocolate covered strawberry. It was happy hour so we got them each for a dollar. Holy crap! The chocolate covered strawberry was the best cupcake I've ever had.  I love this place. I hope SL keeps happy hour and the ccstrawberry forever!

This review isn't for Walmart, but for the bakery specifically. My daughter was turning 3 and we had just gotten home from Vacation. We were throwing her a birthday party and needed a custom cake really last minute. I went to Fry's, Safeway, and Bashas and I wasn't impressed with any of their cakes. The ones on display all looked like crap and were very poorly decorated. I was getting really discouraged when we stopped by Walmart to get a few things. We stopped by the bakery and spotted a Disney Brave cake that looked awesome. I called the next morning and spoke to Alex who went above and beyond to help me with everything I needed. That morning we went in and saw a pre-made Disney princess Garden cake and my daughter decided she wanted that. We ordered it with white confetti cake and raspberry filling.  She did such a good job with our cake. It looked gorgeous, right down to the cursive happy birthday message she wrote for my daughter. We got so many compliments on that cake and it was delicious too.  If you need a pretty cake go see Alex. She rules.

Came here on a whim for lunch and was pleasantly surprised!! This place is cute and a little funky, lots of signage and things everywhere. Definitely a more laid back fun environment. The server was great and quick even though she was the only server and had a bunch of tables. I ordered the red dragon + crunch roll and my daughter the kids teriyaki chicken for 3 dollars. We were brought out complimentary miso soup and salad. The sushi was 8 pieces but u left so full. It was delicious. My favorite part was the spicy tuna. They brought my 4 year olds meal out on a kitty plate and the representation was so cute she ate the entire thing. If you know anything about young kids, it's hard to get them to do that. This place was somewhat busy and had lots of families and coworkers on business lunch, so it's essentially great for everyone.  At the end we got an adorable little orange, whipped cream, chocolate stick boat with our check. If you're looking for fun, cheap, laid back yummy food this is the place. If you're into more fancy, stuffy, expensive sushi places this might not be the place for you. We loved it though!

Gave birth to my daughter here in March. I was excited after hearing some great things about this hospital. The staff was rude and incompetent from the moment we walked in the door. The nurses acted like they were super annoyed anytime you needed anything. It took 6 of them to figure out how dilated I was which resulted in crazy amounts of pain and discomfort.  It took forever to get into a room after waiting in labor 10 hours to finally have a planned c-section, and we were put in a holding room the first night. The room we were eventually put in was tiny and wasn't the one they had promised everyone when we took the tour and pre-registered. The food was horrible too. (yes, I'm aware hospitals food is never that decent!)  This was supposed to be one of the most amazing experiences of my life and it was a complete nightmare. You're way better off at Desert Banner which is where we always have gone after this experience. Thank god for a great on-call surgeon (wouldn't you know my wonderful doctor went out of town that weekend) and a great team + anesthesiologist who made my birthing experience somewhat decent. Otherwise this place is horrible and I will avoid it like the plague. Please think before using their maternity services!!

This location sucks. They always close early and something is always "wrong" with the Carrot Machine. So over showing up there at 9:40 and them having everything shut down or not working.

Literally the worst customer service I've ever had. It's not cool to spend a lot of money in a store where the employees hate their jobs. There was a brunette with longer hair that seemed just miserable and would not help us for anything.  I'll go to Chandler location where on, where everyone is super friendly and helpful.  Also no fitting rooms? No thanks.

This subway is always soo slow. This was my usual subway though, because they make decent sandwiches and are pretty nice. Recently, I came in on Sunday when they have their footlong specials. I've ordered the same thing on Sundays for a couple of weeks in a row. Last week I came in and ordered my usual Turkey melt and Veggie no cheese. They charged me 6 instead of 4.50 because their new machine just rings it up for them. I told them that wasn't the price and they said they would fix it. I looked at the receipt after they charged me and it was still the same. I asked for them to fix it and they said they couldn't. They didn't know how and I pretty much needed to just deal with it. 6 dollars for veggies and bread. It's not that hard to learn your machines and not overcharge people.

Their carne adovada, prickly pear margaritas, and patio are what dreams are are of. We always enjoy having a girls night or date night here, especially during cool weather, so we can sit on the patio. It is pricey, but I've never had better carne adovada anywhere!

Front office staff is incredibly rude. They have no time to fit you in, even if you have an eye infection. First appointment was in 5 days. Then when she asked about my insurance she said she didn't know if they took it, but wouldn't take the time to find out. Even though they were in my network under optometrists. If you're that miserable and lazy, find another job.

There's a reason this place is rated 5 stars across the board! It's sooo yummy and a completely different dining experience than the usual restaurant. My boyfriend was really hungry and wanted to eat at a buffet, but me being the weirdo that I am I needed to look at yelp to find one that wasnt going to be absolutely disgusting. I found this little gem and I'm so glad I did!  When you walk in you're greeted by the owner who also happens to be the cook. Everything is really fresh and you can tell when it hits your taste buds. It's not your typical buffet, but instead you're served as much as you can eat at your table. She cooks different things daily, so when you come in it's kind of a surprise as to what you're gonna get. This time she had soup, chicken skewers, papaya salad, two different curry dishes, drunk chicken, fried rice, orange chicken, and a couple others. Soooo yummy. The orange chicken was actually better than almost any other places I've ever had. At the end she brings you dessert, which was coconut ice cream and something else I can't recall. All for 7.50!  Besides the food being really tasty, it's also a really cool dining experience. If you're feeling adventurous, bring your friends, and experience something totally different from the usual. My boyfriend, who had never eaten thai food before, fell in love. MMM.

Not worth it for the money. Not an actual petting zoo. The animals all had sores and looked completely miserable. There were flies swarming all over us the entire time. Kids were getting bit by fire ants and screaming everywhere. The farmer that have us our hayride was the only awesome part about this place.  We did enjoy picking out a little pumpkin, but they could decorate with a lot more than stickers. Save your money and go to Vertuccio Farms where there is more to do and it's a dollar less.

Literally the most annoying sandwich place on the planet. I tried order the J.J Gargantuan without roast beef, and they still charged me for the Same sandwich without substituting any other meat. For another meat it would be an extra 1.50. Ok, fine whatever. I then attemped to get more mustard and they said they can't give a side of mustard without an extra charge. Really, for Mustard? No thanks. Also, you have to ask for napkins, because they don't have them accessible, and they don't give them to you with your 10 dollar sandwich.  I don't know who Jimmy John is, but Jersey Mike is a way cooler person in my opinion.  I won't be returning. The pickles are fantastic though.

Hell yeah! $3.00 dollars for an automated wash and free vacuums that will seriously suck anything and everything out of your carpets for as long as you need to use them. My car was so clean after this place, that I didn't even mind having to do the interior myself. Awesome!

I love everything about Windsor. I've been here a couple of times, and I loved them all. The last time was my favorite. We came here on Saturday night for my boyfriend's birthday and got a candlelit table on the patio. Patio's are perfect in October, and this one rules. The music they play is really good, but loud..which we enjoyed. It's busy, but not so busy that you have to sit and wait forever. I've gotten the brown bag chicken sandwich and the Windsor burger. While the brown bag has all the amazing ingredients to make an amazing choice, it lacks just a little bit of flavor and is a little dry and "herby" tasting for my liking. The burger however, is amazing. The sweet potatoes and fried okra are delicious as well. Four peaks pumpkin porter is a seasonal and we had that and the Sam Smith's cider.  (Two of my favorites). One of our friends ended the night by getting the birthday boy a Chocolate Elvis...which is ice cream, bananas, peanut butter and whipped cream. Windsor is awesome!

Brought my two year old here to get her first real haircut and it was awesome. Dana is really great with kids and my daughter was so entranced with the Toy Story movie and car she was in that she barely noticed that she was getting a haircut. My daughter has ringlets  and Dana was able to cut her hair to make her curls really fall nicely. For 12 dollars, you really can't beat this place. Awesome.

Took the birthday boy out for a night of spooky food and drinks. We had a really good time. For being that close to halloween, it wasn't over packed. We waited 20 minutes for a table inside..but there were places at the bar and the patio. We decided to wait, because all the monsters and goings on were there. We spent the 20 minutes buying drinks at the bar and walking around taking photos with the monsters. We sat outside for a bit to watch the people going through the haunted house and getting scared. Jason Vorhees was walking around the entire time making people feel scared and/or uncomfortable. Win. I had heard from friends that the food wasn't that good, but I ordered the Dr. Jeckyll Chicken Sandwich, and loved it. It was soo good.How can you even go wrong with bacon, red pepper aoli, avocado, pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, and a toasted bun?! At 9 we were at a pretty good table, so we stayed for the karaoke. Lots of people doing different music. All in all, it might be more exciting for some around Halloween, but for us it was a really good time.....anytime!

The worst Safeway ever. The lines are always backed up and the employees are SO slow. No self checkout or express lanes. If you're shopping there, no one is in the store but the checkout line is always ten minutes long.

Called this place several times, left a voicemail and event sent a Facebook message in regards to their monthly membership. No answers every time I called, no reply on their business page even though they read the message. When a place is this hard to get ahold of how do they even have members?  Thanks for nothing. Good thing there are  plenty of Pilates studios in the valley to choose from and I'd like to attend one that actually has customer service skills.

This was honestly the worst massage I've ever had. I love Thai massage and have gotten one in California and their other location in Mesa. The guy that gave me the Thai yoga slapped my back, pushed his knees so hard into me that it felt like my back was going to crack, and then pulled my hair. He was so rough (and I'm not talking about a good tough deep tissue) im talking no running, just pushing his knees and elbows into my entire body as hard as he good. I left feeling more tense and agitated then when I walked in. This was horrible.

It was my first time at SmashBurger today and I gotta say I enjoyed it. I got the creat your own, and my burger was really tasty. We also got sweet potato smash fries and fried pickles. The fried pickles weren't my favorite, but the fries were delicious. The salad for 6.99 with chicken was a great deal for how big it was. I also love that they have different flavors of unsweetened iced tea.  I will definitely be back.

Started at Lee's on a month trial and quickly realized that as soon as you walk in the door that they want you to commit to paying more, without being able to see how your toddler likes it. It felt pushy like a car dealership the moment we met with them. This place will try to sell you on everything. Whenever the kids graduate you pay 50-80 bucks on top of 100 a month, with mandatory uniforms and all the other gear that you have to pay for. Seems a but much for a young child wanting to try karate for the first time.

This place is SO good! The overall food definitely deserves 5 stars. I had the chicken burrito and it was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken is seasoned and charbroiled and the cabbage, tomato sauce, and sour cream all taste so fresh. I loved it so much the first time, I had to eat it again the following day.  The chips are great, but I didn't love the salsa that came with them. That was just fine, because their salsa bar is a huge plus. I especially loved the pico de gallo and some of their other salsas. Although the food is damn good, there were some things that made the overall experience less than awesome. First all, if you're dining in...expect pure chaos while ordering, waiting for your food and a seat, and using the salsa bar. It's usually so busy that we order take out. Some of the girls that work there mess up the orders pretty well. I've had my orders messed up on the twice now.  Even with all that being said, it's not enough from deterring me to eat from here. I crave their burritos and tacos.

I love this place. It's clean, looks cool, and you can't get much better than 4.99 for crab puff, veggie spring roll, soup and your meal. They also have boba drinks and Thai tea, which we love.  It doesn't look like much on the outside (ghetto strip mall) but it really is awesome. The orange chicken is really crispy, so be ready for something a little different than you're used to with OC. The veggie spring rolls are delcious, but the Egg drop soup was eh.  I will be coming here a lot in the future for lunch. Yum!

I saw that they had a first time special and read the great reviews before I decided to stop in this weekend to try the Versa spray tan. I gotta say, this place is awesome. The man (I assume the owner) that runs this place is super nice and thorough. It's extremely clean and quick.  I can't believe how gorgeous my level 2 spray tan is. Absolutely amazing!

Totally a cute place and I love the atmosphere, but holy crap...the iced coffee tasted so burnt and flavorless. 3.50 for a small iced coffee and it was awful. Such a bummer.

We love this place. My 2.5 year old daughter keeps asking to go back. It's really clean, and there are lots of fun activities for younger children. Some days it's pretty slow which we actually like because there's let's chaos and more room for the kids to enjoy each activity. Big bouncy castle, slides and climbing, kitchens, puzzles, buggies, etc. the best part is it's 4.95 for the entire day!  There's also free wifi and a cafe with coffee.  Awesome.

Fantastic manicure!! Kris was fast and efficient but didn't skimp on anything. My cuticles were a mess and she made them so much better. I didn't opt for gel this time because I'm trying to grow my nails really long naturally and I need to repair them from acrylics and gel in the past. They didn't pressure me into the gels and I liked that.  Like others have said, this nail bar is absolutely the cutest. I love the decor. It does get busy, but mornings during the weekday they can usually get you right in.  I wanted half moons and showed her a photo and they came out great. I'll post a photo. (The scab on my cuticle was from a precision cut I already had and she didn't irritate it.)  I'll be back!!!!!

Be weary of the servers at Top Golf. Especially ones named Hannah M. She altered my receipt and gave herself a 110% tip. When my credit card company called to dispute the charge, the manager called me back the next day and tried to refund only the altered tip. I didn't even get an apology for the altered receipt, overcharging my card, or spending a Saturday on the phone trying to get the charges reversed. You suck top golf.

This place is such a big fat yes for me. When you first walk in, there's a small bar area, but the actual place is set up so it feels really open and spacious. It's clean and the service is fantastic.  The flights come in beakers served on brass knuckle trays and they were playing old school rap. The whole vibe is awesome and everything is really well thought out.  But the real star of the show here is obviously their beers. They are so, so good. We were super bummed that the Mjango Unchained wasn't ready, they were out of war paint and the peach Lolli, but there was still a lot to be happy about. We ended up trying the cherry sour beer, the 480G, the Lolli, and the Ska hoperandi. After the flights, we went with the 480G and the Lolli mixed with the black and blue cider. I loved that the black and blue wasn't as sweet as most ciders and had more of a wine spritzer feel to it. The food we had was awesome. The Cobb wrap and the Sw pulled pork were both super tasty and I couldn't get over the crunchy fries with their ranch.  B.R.I., I love you and I'll be back a million times.

My new favorite bar. So nice to get away from your typical Scottsdale bar and walk into somewhere original like the King.  The atmosphere at the King rules. I love the leather bar, the taxidermy animals, the chalk board walls, the big booths, and the photos of Elvis. As soon as you walk in you feel totally welcome and everyone is super friendly, even the bar patrons. The drinks are cheap and they have some awesome cheap beers. 64 oz? Old Milwaukee? PBR tall cans? Hamms? Negro Modelo? Check. But my favorite is the brown bag bingo. Mystery shots of whatever numbered ball you roll for a dollar. Once you do a couple, everyone at the bar follows suit and it becomes a fun thing to watch.    It was a Monday night, so skeeball was free, but the pinball was also free and I'm not sure why. We played street fighter 2 for a good solid 20 minutes. On the nights skeeball isn't free, if you get a high score you get a dollar beer ticket.   Also, The Mac and Cheese balls are amazing.

I came in 30 mins from closing and everything was fresh and hot. They made me mixed veggies because they were out. The ladies here were nicer than any other location. We frequent panda every few weeks, because it's easy for the whole family. This is one of the nicer, newer locations and the food is better here than most.

Worst wings ever! We got both bone in and bone out. 12 dollars is highway robbery here. The bone out tasted like Tyson or Banquet microwaved wings with sauce added. The bone in was all chewy fat. So gross. The breadsticks were pretty good, so if you come here I'd suggest getting those. Thanks but no thanks!

I've been to a crazy amount of nail places in the Valley and unfortunately most of them have been lackluster to downright awful. Its crazy how difficult it is to find someone to do an awesome gel manicure.  I recently moved jobs and found this salon after reading reviews for places in the area. I decided to book an appointment with Tracey. I'm so happy I found her! I was able to get right in and although she was very busy, she focused on my nails and did an awesome job. I've gotten so many compliments in just two days of having them.  Thanks nunails, I'll be back! Again and Again!

I've been wishing for a place like this for so long!!!! Drive thru salads?! Wraps, smoothies, soups and breakfast. I love that I can come through anytime of day and get a fast salad with super fresh ingredients. I got the cypress salad with chicken and the seasonal tropical smoothie. The pesto dressing and huge chunks of mozzarella were so good!!!! Love this place, hope it sticks around.
