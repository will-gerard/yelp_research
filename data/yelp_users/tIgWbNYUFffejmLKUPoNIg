Posted a review About palms place...might be the same hotel as the palms casino, but the staff and professionalism of palms hotel casino was amazing. From the moment I walked in elda was the nicest, most helpful, courteous person I have ever worked with. The way she treated me from check-in made the entire trip amazing. Crazy how one good person, can change your entire experience. If you need anything, I would recommend reaching out to Elda at the palms!!!

Spent good money to spend the night in penthouse d ($,$$$.cc) on July 5th. It had a private hot tub on the side of the room, main reason we booked the room. Went to use hot tub about 10pm and it was ice cold and jets were none functional.  Went down stairs, they lady that checked me in, was in the bar drinking... Told her about my issue, Said no problem, she would comp a future night, couldn't be fixed that night.  Said she noted it in the computer.  Called to setup a room for this past week, to use my free room, and carol that palms place manager wanted to only comp me a standard room....less then 100.00 a night room. Wouldn't you expect to be comped in the same room you paid to upgrade to, that was none functional??? Amazing hotel, but carol and the staff at palms place was very unrealistic, and almost insulted by her offer.

This has to be one of the best places is Peoria. Great dinners, always changing specials and the best breakfast around. Great service and a fun local hang out. Anyone in the area should check it out. It's had a great story behind it too!
