Home Depot sucks! We bought an $800 welder and it was stolen from the  truck in their loading zone, while one of their associates watched. When we made a police report, the security cameras were either not working or not pointing in the right direction. They offered us $100 off if we bought another one, they give $50 off if you just ask for it-no thanks Home Depot, we will find another place to buy our equipment from now one.

After all of the correspondence and conversations, today we got a gift certificate for $800 so we can now get a welder and just be paying for one welder.   thank you Home Depot!
