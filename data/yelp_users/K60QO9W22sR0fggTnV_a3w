So, I've been to FEZ before & have experienced great service with attentive servers & have always been pleased with everything.  On this particular occasion, i was starving & convinced my friend, Luis, (who is a frequent visitor to FEZ) to grab food. We could have chosen any other place in central Phoenix but decided on FEZ, I was craving Maizie's myself. Anyway, we get to FEZ & we're seated almost immediately. We sat there for about 10 minutes when, finally, the server, Monika (with a K), takes our drink order but, at this point, we're ready to order our drinks & food. I wanted to order a pomegranate press but misplaced my ID so I opted for an iced tea instead. (By the way, great server for asking for ID, she's definitely on top of that! And I commend her for it.)   Our food arrives within 15 minutes - fantastic! So far, the experience was okay but I thought she would be more attentive than before (lack of asking for our drink orders before food) but, no, she gave me one refill & that was it for the next 40 minutes. It took us about 20 minutes to eat, & I needed another refill. Thinking that she would come over, I waited until I realized that she was nowhere to be found. We kept looking around for her. All the other servers seemed to be on top of everything, (especially a gal with a ponytail braid & bettie bangs, I hope we get her next time; should I decide to go back). She finally emerged from the back about 10 minutes later, & I thought she would check on us. Monika, went to two other tables before us, refilled *their* water & disappeared again.   10 minutes later, we were sitting there, waiting for her to make another appearance. She finally came back, gave me a refill *after* I asked & *after* she took our plates, she asked if we wanted dessert. No thanks.   My friend & I debated on whether or not we should give her a tip. We decided that the service wasn't worth a tip & I even included a note on the receipt explaining why we didn't give her a tip.   I'm in the hospitality & customer service industry myself. I go in to work knowing that I need to provide quality customer service to a) Get a great tip & B) To obtain repeat customers/guests.  For readers out there, FEZ has delicious food & drinks; I've recommended this place many times but the service, on this occasion, was crappy.

So I wrote a review before about my Fez dinner experience with a certain server; which shall remain named in my previous review.  I went in on a Tini Tuesday on November 8th to see what my friends were all raving about. There weren't too many people there but that didn't take away from the great people my friend & I met at the bar. Everyone was very social & welcoming.  Had it not been for the bartender's incredible upbeat attitude, friendly smile & outgoing demeanor I probably wouldn't have given Fez another shot. Brandon was exceptional & he was the epitome of wonderful customer service, for that I gave a great tip; which he'll probably tell you about. :) Unfortunately, he told me that he would be leaving in the next few weeks but I had a great time & I really hope that there are more servers & bartenders like Brandon.   Thanks again, Brandon, for making my Fez experience a great one!

I went here with my roommate on their $5 burger Mondays; not really expecting much but was absolutely impressed with the service AND the burgers. I definitely recommend trying out one of their nights, I'm sold & will try other menu items. Thanks, Vig!
