They offer an extensive menu of typical Chinese American restaurant selections, but also several dishes not often found in most restaurants, including several specialty noodles, soups and seafood items.   At times, they also have some Thai dishes.  They have several Lunch Specials for around $5 and quick service to go or dine in.

Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Bell location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no cheese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home!

The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian on thin crust.    We recently took my in-laws here and it was a hit with all! My nephew loved the cheese steak calzone. My mother and father in-law got a thick crust pizza, which was huge and hearty!  They may still be eating it for leftovers. Bro in-law and niece split a plain cheese pizza and said it was aewsome.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home.

Since I feel Lowe's has already wasted enough of my time, I will just post the email I sent to Lowe's customer service site.  The comments about this location can be found in paragraphs 2 and 3:  I am an extremely dissatisfied customer after trying to purchase your Greenfiber Blow-in attic insulation with the advertised free 24 hr machine rental.  I first visited store location #1204 on my way home from work Wednesday 3/23/11 around 5:30pm to obtain details on the purchase/rental conditions.  First, it took me about 10 minutes to locate a sales associate and I actually had to find someone in a different department.  She was actually courteous and professional and directed me to ask for details at the commercial sales counter.  I found someone near the commercial sales counter that offered to contact some one to answer my questions.  The contacted associate arrived and  informed me that the employees for the counter leave at 4pm.  I asked for details on the deal and he said it was a 20 bag minimum purchase for the free rental (which is what I read online).  I asked, if I purchase the product in advance can I then reserve the rental for a later date.   He stated that he couldn't give me full details on the rental deal, but if I called back in the morning to the commercial sales desk after 7am, that they would be able to reserve the machine for me.    When I called the next around 9am 3/24/11, the lady informed me that they do not reserve that machine and the best thing to do would be to call Saturday morning and see if a machine was still available to rent or come in first thing in the morning. My wife and I chose to come in at the time the store opened at 6am on Saturday 3/26/11.  When we arrived we headed straight to the commercial sales desk and were informed we had to go to customer service to rent the machine.  We walked across the store to customer service and there was some in line renting the machine.  I had seen two machines next to the product that looked used, so I asked if there were more than one machine.  I also asked another employee for the phone number to the Scottsdale store #0792 to check their availability on the machine rental, as it was the next closest store to our home.  I called this store and the employee in commercial sales stated they did have a machine available, but he could not hold it for me as it is first come first serve. By this point the customer service desk looked up on their computer and stated the N. Phx store only had one machine available for rental. Next, we headed straight for the store #0792.  We arrived at store #0792 about 6:40am.  We headed straight for the customer service desk, as that was where store#1204 had told us that is the desk that handles rentals.  Customer service promptly told us to go to commercial sales for rental, which we immediately did.  When we got to the commercial sales counter the employee did remember my call.  When he looked up in the computer for the machine he found it had actually been rented before I called. He apologized and I expressed my frustration with both store locations and that was going to take my business elsewhere.  In general, I find this first come first service policy for tool rentals does not meet the needs of the "do-it-yourself" customers I would think Lowe's would like to attract.  It is extremely inconvenient. Most of us work full-time and are trying to complete our project on what little "free time" we have.  In larger projects we are also generally trying to coordinate with family and friend's schedules to complete the project.  We DO NOT have the time to be waking up at the crack of dawn every weekend in hopes that we will be the first "lucky one" at the desk to rental the tools we need to complete our projects.   I understand your company may have had past problems with people reserving tools and then not picking them up, which may have led to the first-come-first-serve policy. However, I think there would be better options to allow reservations, like have a small deposit due to hold a reservation or a 30 minute pick up timeframe.  Those are just a few ideas.  I also would have had no problem purchasing the $200+ for the product, if a future reservation would have been promised.     Finally, at this point in time I will not be doing business with any Lowe's location and I will inform my family and friends of this negative experience with your company.  I have spent over 2 hours this week getting the run around from these 2 stores and we did find another source to obtain the materials I need to complete my project.   I will post this letter under both store locations.

Ok, I did get response from both the national Lowe's website customer care and the manager of the North Phoenix store within 2 days.  The National customer care only forwarded my email to the North Phoenix store. The manager at the North Phoenix store did apologize, admitted his employees were misinformed, stated the issue was addressed with the employees and that the problem would not happen again. However, considering I received about 3 different stories from the employees and the manager was not specific in his email, I still have no idea what the rental policy is at Lowe's for the item I wanted to rent. I will give them an extra star for responding and stating they have addressed the issue, but I will be in no rush to return to Lowe's. I believe I have found another source for the equipment and materials I need, now I just need to find the time extra help to do the project...

Pizza is cheap, but nothing too fancy.  I think a large pepperoni is still around $5, small and lunch size also starting under $4.  The quality of the pizza is much higher than you'd expect for the price and the workers are very friendly. This is a 1980's pizzeria style atmosphere, a small selection of video games, and they still sale pitchers of beer and soda.  There use to be a few west valley locations I ate at growing up, so I have some fond memories of this place.  Now it is just the Mesa location, so I stop there when I can.

I chose these guys to pick up and deliver a piano, which I got a great deal on at a yard sale back in May.  They were able to work with my schedule and fit me in within a couple of days.  Dave was amazing at his expertise on placing the piano on moving wheels, maneuvering, and loading  it.  He took great care and had a professional trailer to load and secure the piano for the drive.  Good communication and expected time frame estitmate.  Their prices were very competitive and I believe they have flat rates based on type of piano in the Phoenix metro area, which is nice to know the cost upfront.

My family has been going here since before I was born, mom and dad actually stopped there on the way home from the hosptial when my brother was born.  My mom learned how to make sweet and sour sauce from one of the first cooks. Although it has gone through 3 owners, I think in my life, they have always kept it the same.  The number selections are small compared to today's mega Chinese buffetts, but their fried rice is the best I've had on any buffett.  The other dish I highly recomend are the meatballs! My bro and I always call ahead to see if the meatballs are on the buffett that day.  They are like nothing I've had anywhere else, sauce is sort of a cross of sweet and sour and a really bold bbq sauce.  Most the other dishes are just moderate in taste and quality. The service is always friendly and quick. I reconize it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think every should try it at least once.

My family has been going to this restaurant for years.  I wouldn't classify it as traditional Mexican food, but the food and service is always good and the chips and salsa are excellent!  I tend to order the San Marcos Burrito which is like a chimichanga cover in a spicy cream sauce. The tamales are also very good, they have the standard red and sweet green corn versions, plus a unique Vegi one that has broccoli, carrots, and other things you wouldn't normally expect in tamales.  The also offer a "Mini Menu" that will save on the wallet, but is still plenty of food and have lunch specials (which are actually served till closing on Mondays)

Pie Zanos Kitchen offers a unique pizza experience.  They sell individual pizza pies that can include a wide range of toppings from the traditional to the bizarre, making it a great place for a group with various tastes or diets.  You can choose from one of their specialty pies with such names as the Volcano, Bordertown and Bo Diddley, or make your own pizza creation.  When you create your on pie you start by choosing your crust (white, wheat, gluten free, focaccia bread, or flavored crust), then choose from 8 sauces, select from 7 different cheeses, add any extra herbs/seasonings you would like, then it is to the toppings... If you didn't come up with something strange from the sauces and cheese, the toppings is where you can go crazy.  They offer over 20 veggies including such oddities as pickle slices, sweet potato, and corn. For meats you have your standards plus gyro meat, sliced meatballs and tofu.  In addition to pizza, they have salads (one that you select your veggies and cheese), sandwiches, soup, and breakfast items featuring frittatas (of course you can build your own). Finally, they do have a wine and beer selection with happy hour specials from 4-7pm.

I've been going to Stinkweeds for half my life now at 3 different locations and have always had great experience there. They keep up with many of my favorite English language bands and let me know when new release are out. If you have several bands you follow, you should sign up on Stinkweeds email list to receive weekly updates of new release. If you are having trouble finding something, you should definitely ask and they'll do their best to order it. They are also great with their phone list and give you calls as soon as the item comes in. There are a few other good, friendly local record stores, but Kimber and Lindsay at Stinkweeds are the best( the dudes are decent too). Parking lot and entrance are in the back, sometimes entering behind the Diary Queen on central is easier...

I have been eating at Sala Thai for at least 4 years now.  I thought I had done a review, but I guess my "Brain to Yelp" Implant wasn't working that day.  Anyway, this one of the best Thai restaurant I have found in the Phoenix area and they have an extensive menu that should have something for everyone.  I generally get the Thai Omelet with Pork, or if I feel like getting a variety by trading portions with my wife I'll get veg/tofu dish.  The omelet is stuffed with your choice meat, clear noodles and other good things. It is not greasy at all and has a fluffy texture.  It is severed with a side of fish sauce to drizzle over the omelet.  We have tried several of the veg/tofu dishes with Spicy Green Bean, Spicy Ginger, Pad-Woon-Sen and Spicy Basil Leaves being the highlights, but all the dishes I've tried have been tasty and fresh.  Last time my dad was in town we took him here and he ordered the Chicken Satay to share, it had a fresh grilled taste and had a nice dipping sauce.  The majority of the dishes can be prepared with your choice of meat or tofu for the protein and you select the level of spiciness you would like.  They also have a vegetarian page in the menu that includes some appetizers and entrées prepared vegetarian.   They have expanded the dining area, so now you rarely run into long waiting times that was once a problem here. One of my favorite things about Sala Thai is their "mocktail" drink selection including several fruit flavors, Thai iced tea, Thai coffee and I believe they also recently added Boba style drinks.  They use to have a dish named "Son-in-Law Egg", but I think they took it off the menu.  Unfortunately, I was never brave enough to try it... Maybe if you ask they can still prepare it.  Also, they have opened a Goodyear location on Litchfield Rd south of the I-10 for those you out west.  This is great place if you like Thai food, want to introduce someone to Thai cuisine or have a party with people with several different diet/lifestyle choices.

The Phoenix Roadrunner Park Farmers Market is a great little market to find all kinds of produce and local products. The venders are generally about 40% produce, 30% local food products, 15% percent fresh food/drinks, and 15% miscellaneous products.  If you're only looking for produce, it can be difficult to remain disciplined with so many other great local food products, just watch your budget!  I recommend avoiding the parking lot adjacent to the market, it is better to park of 36th Street and take a little stroll through the park. Some of my favorite products here are fresh chili peppers, fresh herbs, unique fruits/vegetables, local dairy products and tamales.

Great place to grab a quick lunch! Mama Mia's prepares good old fashion thin crust style pizza and the slices are huge!  They have a wide variety of toppings and you can have different toppings on each slice.  My favorite combo is 1 ham and pineapple, 1 pepperoni.  They also offer salads, subs and calzones (expect an extra wait).  There is also the original Mama Mia's at 40th St and Indian School. Special: 2 slices (cheese) and a can of soda- $4 even, (Add. toppings 25 cents). Their subs are also excellent!

Tried this place out a couple weeks ago with my Fiancee. She is Vegan, I am not, but I'm very open to meat alternatives. We both really enjoyed our food. We started with the spring rolls, which had an excellent dipping sauce. I had the Jasmine Ice Tea that had a great flavor for an unsweetened Ice tea. My fiancee ordered the Sweet and Sour "Chicken" and really liked it, which is good as sometimes she does not like the fake meat. I ordered the Spicy Cha Cha, which is breaded soy shrimp. The breading was well seasoned, crispy and not greasy. I used the spring roll dipping sauce for the shrimp and would recommend getting a dipping sauce with this dish. All in all it was great experience. My fiancee's only suggestion is the have more veggie dishes not based on fake meats.

Smeeks is a great place to look for an old-time favorite candy or soda.  I usually stop here for at least a soda after picking up music next-door at Stinkweeds, Green River and Dublin Dr. Pepper are my faves. . They generally have about 20 kinds of soda, although not heavily stocked. Today I got Double Cola and Dang, a butterscotch root beer my wife swears by.  Candy is their main selection, you will find old childhood favorites and stuff you have never seen before.  Great for stocking stuffer and and a little extra to a birthday gift.  Being that their selection is one of a kind and hard to get, be prepared to pay a bit more.  Although now that the average price for a candy bar at a convenience store is over $1, it really isn't that big of a difference.

I was a bad boy, I left my old Diamondback Mt. bike to the elements and in a shed for several years.  I took it in to Sunday Cycle to see if it was worth fixing up.  One of the service staff, Jamie looked it over giving me details of what would need to be done, break down of items to service/replace and an estimate for the overall job.  I really like this bike, used it all through college and decided to go for it.  There was only one thing that came up extra during the service, but they immediately called me to let me know about it and to see how I wanted them to proceed. Unfortunately, when they flushed out the gear pods they no longer functioned.  They actually dropped the fee for the flush and credited it towards new gear pods!  After it was finished, the final price came right in at the estimate they quoted.  It is a cool little bike shop, good music, pop corn for snacking, good prices, with a friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I will definitely revisit  for future bike service or if I decide to update to a new bike.

Unique little store specializing in fresh dairy goods from local AZ dairies. I first heard about this store from a guy at the Roadrunner park Saturday Market giving away free sample of cheese curds.  I was in Tempe today, so I decided to stop by and grab some cheese curds.  They are great!  And, a coworker from WI gives them a thumbs up approval!    Cool place to check out.  It can be a bit hard to find, it is on the SW corner of Hardy and Broadway. You drive through a gate to the parking lot, then you'll see the store on the left. Also, CASH ONLY

Stopped in here for lunch today. I have only had Jimmy John's 1 time before at the Central Phoenix Location and a year ago, and was not really blown away by their style of Subs. Today I didn't quite few like my usual Sub stop for my work lunch break down the street, so I thought I'd give Jimmy's another try. Again I found I would only give the sub sandwich a moderate score, but it was the service and the manager (at least he seemed in charge) going the extra mile after one of their (newer I'm guessing) employees made a mistake on cleaning the windows. When the employee went to the clean the door and windows, he sprayed the Windex like crazy and the fan totally blew it all over my table. Before I could even react to the situation, the manger was correcting the employee for the bad cleaning technique decision and immediately offered to make me a new sandwich even though I only had about a 1/4 left. In less than a minute I had my new sub, which I will actually have for breakfast in the morning.   I understand that everyone makes mistakes and that often at fast food joints it is an employee's first job, so I usually expect the management to make right any of the blunders, without the customer having to raise a fuss. This Jimmy John's location has delivered that level of quality in customer service and I plan on returning. Also, after looking over the menu a bit more, I think maybe I will like the subs better if I add a few of the "freebies" to my sub next time.

My wife noticed this place tucked away on the south west corner of Cave Creek Rd and Thunderbird/Cactus a couple weeks ago.  We were able to stop in last Friday for dinner to give it a try, since we both love Thai food.  When we arrived just before 6pm we were appaerantly the first one there for the dinner hour.  In the back of my mind I was thinking, great even if the place is excellent it looks like they are having trouble attracting customers.  Luckily, by time we left there were about 6 other table filled and things seemed to be picking up.  I noticed a couple low reviews on Yelp, but we had a great experience. I'm hoping those were just opening pains of a new restaurant that unfortunately led to a disappointing experience...  Since we were the first to arrive for dinner, we were able to gain a little insight on the place from our waiter.  He explained that the preparation/style of dishes are in the tradition of Northern Thai Cuisine, as opposed to the Southern/ Bangkok  style which most Thai restaurant in the valley follow.  He warned us that the spicy level of the northern style is generally higher than the southern style and recommended we order a bit lower spice level than we would at other restaurant, but he would provide us with chili blends in case we choose bring the heat level up in our dishes.  The spice level our dishes were prepared was adequate, but did leave us room to try the two chili blends provided.  The chili blends were great!  One was dark red ground chilies with I guess a bit of oil, similar to a dense chili oil you might find at a Chinese restaurant, but with a deeper more intense flavor.  The other was a dry blend of several ingredients which had an earthy tone on top of the medium heat level.  The waiter said a previous customer asked if the sold the chili blends to take home, which I hope the restaurant will consider as I would definitely by a bottle of each.  The menu selection had several familiar Thai dishes, plus to some extra unique seafood, noodle and soup offerings you can't find at other valley Thai restaurants.  Most the entrées can be prepared with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, tofu, pork, roast duck, scallops, squid, shrimp, mussel or combination of meat.  We decided to try two of our usual favorites Spicy Green Bean (Tofu) and Red Curry (Tofu), so we had a baseline for comparison to other restaurants.  Both dishes vegetable had a fresh crispness and the tofu was prepared nice and crispy.  The Spicy Green bean sauce had a greater depth and earthiness to it than I have had at other restaurants.  The red curry had a full flavor with a smooth and creamy texture, complimented by the spice combination in the curry blend.  You could definitely tell there was some difference in the preparation of the dishes than you might find at other restaurants in the valley.  This is a great place if you are familiar with Thai cuisine, but would like to expand your Thai food experience.  We both look forward to trying more dishes here!

Great place to pick up quick Indian food in the North Valley!  My wife and I stopped by here last night after reading the other good reviews on yelp, seeing the great prices on the menu, and feeling like watching a movie at home with good food. We ordered Chana Masal, Aaloo Gobi, and Vegatable Biryani. All three had excellent flavor and spices.  The spice level is pretty high, which is fine by us but if you are not into heat you may want ask if they can tone it down. The Biryani came in a bag, which was new to me but I wonder if that might be typical of take away curry in India and Europe.  Although I've never been to India, this food seemed more authentic than other restaurant in the valley. Keeping that in mind, you may want to watch for spice pods, curry leaves and whole chillies in the dishes, as the food is less processed than you may be use to.  It is good to have this new place for Indian, which offers great veggie options and meat options as well. Great prices with quick and friendly service!

Modern Grill is a new restaurant providing fresh pizza, salads, and sandwiches in NE Phoenix. They also have a bar and small market area with wine, specialty jams and other unique grocery items. Their original location is in Flagstaff and they are now expanding to the metro Phoenix area. Several items are sourced locally for freshness and almost all dishes are made from scratch. On my first trip, I went for breakfast and ordered their bacon, egg and cheese panini. The egg was cooked perfectly for a sandwich and the bacon was very flavorful. Coffee is self serve in the morning, and available in a to go cup to top of for the road.  The staff is friendly and quick to serve customers, today even passing out free pumpkin muffins! I will be back to try dinner.
