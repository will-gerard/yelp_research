I should have kept driving when we pulled in and there's paramedics with a huge Fire Engine in front of the restaurant with gobs of odd looking people standing around the commotion.  I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to.    But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp!  There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet.  I should have also noticed something was "up" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot.  But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal.  There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner.    Besides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap!  I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient.

The customer service is stellar!  The quality of the printing is top of the line, I've never seen more crisp and vibrant printing!  The turn around time is impeccable.  I would recommend this Alphagraphics for anyone looking to make a professional impression, looking for efficient and quality workmanship and looking for great customer service.

I've known Malinda for a few years through Animal Rescue since she's very active in the Rescue community (running Potato Chips Pomeranians as of late) and she's always been very kind and giving, offering free grooming service to rescued animals who were in need of a good grooming.  So I was thrilled when I moved to Ahwatukee so I could start using her services.  The grooming salon is neat and clean and the staff is very friendly.  My long hair Chihuahua, Phoebe looked and smelled great when we picked her up and I highly recommend this place!

I am not sure that anyone that works at this company knows what the definition of customer service really means.  The service is unfriendly, slow and the facility is filthy.  I've used restaurooms in gas stations that are cleaner.  Not to mention, they're not really inexpensive, in fact quite the opposite.  We had planned to get glasses but after waiting about 30 min after the eye exam with 3-people ahead of us, we decided to just take the script and go.  Now I find out after trying to order glasses online, that they didn't provide the PD (pupilary distance) on the script so we have to go back in to get that measured because when I called they said, "its not something we normally provide" - um but in order to get glasses you need the PD so what good is the script!  I freaking hate this place!

My eight (8) dogs (yes I said 8) stayed at Second Home Pet Resort recently and I have to say it was THE best pet resort experience I've ever had!  The facility is new, modern, clean, very upscale and the prices are very competitive offering discounts for multiple pets.  It was way cheaper than having an in home pet sitter and I had peace of mind knowing that they were safe at all times.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly and even was able to handle my dogs with special needs (undersocialized dog and a dog that required daily medicine).   I recommend this place to anyone that is looking for top quality amenities for their pets and top notch service.

Saw Christopher Titus on New Years Eve, they got us right in and seated, the service was great and there seemed to be no bad seat in the house.  Good atmosphere and lighting although the NYE Decorations were cheesy....the comedian was even cutting on them!  It was a great venue and will definitely be back!
