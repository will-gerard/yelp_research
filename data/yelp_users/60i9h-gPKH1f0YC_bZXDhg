Superb venue  USAC hosted Disney on Ice in April 2013.  Had a great experience with my little girl.    Location is easy to get to with convenient parking at multiple sites surrounding the arena.  The Diamondbacks ball field is across the block.  Venue has open and getting to your seats is a breeze.  Nice staff, as well.  Only knock is their hotdogs smell like ham that's been sitting out.  Had to pass on the meal because it was so off-putting.  Didn't stop us (and a BAJILLION little girls) from enjoying the show though.

Super Enjoyable for Family Time  Phoenix only has a few great places for a family day with kids. Luckily, Phoenix Zoo is rocking it. The recent and continuing renovations make the place more enjoyable all the time. It's simple to navigate, hands-on areas allow you to feed giraffes and rays and captivate little ones, and special events keep things fresh. They also have occasional deals on Groupon and LivingSocial, which can get you a good deal.   Compliments on the enclosures. They look like great spaces for the animals while giving visitors great views.  Hint: Bring a wagon for carting things around. There are a good number of play areas and activities that the kiddos want to do. A wagon lets someone manage the stuff while the other is with the young ones.

Average to a little less than average.  Staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check.  Waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there.  Didn't mind looking back at her while it seemed like she thought about asking for more.    Food is average Szechwan fare.  Hot and Sour Soup is spicier and good, but missing the sour part.  Dumplings were good quality and didn't skimp on meat.  However, their sauces were bland.  Almond Chicken is servicable... just skip noticing that they use peanuts instead of almonds and that there is barely 3 oz of chicken.  Rice was a tad dry.  Meh...

Amazing Father-Daughter High Tea / Very Good Conference Facility  Originally visited the Phoenix Ritz when my wife bought my eldest daughter and I the Father-Daughter High Tea experience for Father's Day.  It was a sweet affair-- Sophi got to dress up and I had the pleasure of serving as her first date.  Jeffrey, the tea sommelier (yes, TEA sommelier) was very kind and attentive to us dads in attendance.  He described the options, then my daughter and I chatted of tea, snacks, and little desserts.  It was a joy to watch her smile and excitement beam through. And when Jeffrey sang Butterfly Kisses, I and another dad were choking back tears as inconspicuously as possible-- "My what fine crown molding up there on the ceiling.  Ah-hem!  Yes, fine workmanship!"    Father-Daughter High Tea at the Ritz is one of Phoenix's quiet gems on an experience.  This past weekend, I was there again, but for a conference.  Very attentive staff as is the standard at the Ritz.  Even though it's somewhat hidden, the facilities are maintained well and the conference was a supremely comfortable experience.  The meals were superb and the wifi was fast.  In all, the food, service, and special experiences at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix are five-star.  However, the facility doesn't live up to what I've come to expect from the Ritz and it doesn't resonate the brand.  For example, I can't think of a picture to take at this location that would instantly make a person think it was Ritz-caliber.  For other lines, this is a five-star property.  For Ritz-Carlton, the unremarkable entry area, quaint pool, and amenities that show their age look out of place.  I feel like I'm being only a little unfair.  Still, a Ritz 5-star rating is something remarkable in my experience.

A true Chi-town experience  Getting a real Chicago Dog in Phoenix is more difficult that you would think.  Anyone can throw celery salt and relish on a hot dog.  But to get the real Vienna beef, bight green relish, and soft bun right is an art.  And these folks have it down.  Fun to also look at all the Chicago memorabilia.  My wife, a Chicago girl, ranked this place on par with an authentic Portillos.  The shakes are also a yummy compliment to the meal.  Good prices, too.  Only drawback is that we may take on the Chicago body shape if we visit Chicago Hamburger Co as often as we would be inclined.  Oooh, and I bought one of their t-shirts!

Missing the days of good Best Buy service  Visited this Best Buy for Christmas gifts. Store is clean and easy to navigate, with attractive display areas for Samsung, Apple, and video games. The knocks against it are the poor service and prices.  Looking for two gifts on our list of extended family, the prize for a Braun razor was $30 higher than on Amazon. An electric toothbrush was about $14 more. On the side, I looked at some earbuds for my computer. Decided against it as it wasn't a need and prices were high on the other items. When we stopped in at Ross a store down the row? You guessed it: Same ear buds for $20 less!   Customer service here is really odd. Walking by the computers, three people were eager to help us but two couldn't answer a quick question about video cards versus Intel on-chip video support for recent games. In the phones, a cheery lady asked if she could help. I asked her if Best Buy had any deals on iPhone 6s. She said no... AND JUST WALKED AWAY. Not one more word or a glance. Stepping up to buy a DVD on my daughter's list, there were three young guys and not one of them was at their register until I pointed at them and then the registers. You'd think a store would like to actually sell some stuff! :o)  Ah, well. Best Buys will change to Amazon Showrooms soon enough...

Remarkable foodie experience  I read about Kai in Phoenix Magazine and made reservations for an anniversary dinner for my wife and I.   It was a tour of exquisite dishes, prepared wonderfully, and coupling in Sonoran Desert ingredients and flavors that are completely novel in everyday cuisine.   Jeremy was superb in leading the service staff. We were pampered and took occasional moments to enjoy the sunset over the mountains, followed by lightning periodically igniting the clouds as night took over.   From amuse to the tribal buffalo and duck entr√©es to the desserts, it's a meal my wife and I agreed we will remember for a long time.

One of our fave places for kidswear  Nordstrom has one of the best selections for kids clothes and shoes. They have the great breadth of fashions, the service is usually excellent, and we find the brands my wife and I like-- Tom's, Tucker + Tate, Tea, Splendid, Stride Rite, et al.  Often fine some neat things on sale, too-- a superb way to exceed our budget in a fun way.  Now, if only this skinny jeans fad would pass...

Beautiful chocolate and nice people  Dropped in for our free piece of the month... and a few extra delicious items.  It's amazing how that member promo routinely gets me to buy more than I intended.  Dang chocolate addiction!  The have some new Trufflelata flavors.  We went with the Salted Caramel and the Oreo.  So good!  At one point, we were shopping and my wife noticed our baby girl had managed to get the straw in her mouth and sucked down a quarter of the liquid chocolate before she noticed.  Once she pried Livy off, she just moaned "Mmmmm" over and over, again.  (That's my girl!)  Couple new truffle flavors, as well.  All superb.  I especially liked the Hazelnut Crunch.  Service was nice, albeit a tad slow.  I forgive people when they hand me a chocolate shake at the end, though. :o)

Finally found a good pumpkin hunting experience.  My wife and I have been searching for a fun pumpkin hunting option for the past three years. We realize that Arizona desert is no Oregon or Colorado, where there were cool festivals with tons of pumpkins plated that you get to traipse through and choose from.  Still, we hoped there would be something at least close.  After no-gos in Glendale and Scottsdale the past two years-- just have a few sad rides and a pile of pumpkins stacked on hay bails-- Schenpf Farms hit the mark.    Our five year-old liked the rides, petting zoo, jumping pillows, corn mazes, and pony circle.  Our six month-old enjoyed watching the animals and people.  The food options are a good mix and it's not bad.  For adults, the parking is relatively easy, smoking is kept limited, there is music, things are actually clean.  The pumpkin patch isn't huge, but it's superb compared to the rest of the options in the Valley.  And for $42, it was a full day's entertainment for everyone.  Tips:  (1) Wear shoes!  They water to keep dust down, but you're still traipsing through alot of desert and a pumpkin patch.  (2) Do pumpkin hunting at the end.  No sense carrying the pumpkins around all day, like we saw a few people do.  (3) Buy tickets at Fry's for a couple dollars off each ticket.  (4) Have some cash. Not all food vendors take credit card.

Excellent service and food with nice rooms  Didn't realize the Westin Kierland had so much going for it.  Staying there, I was surprised how large the resort feels from the inside with the hotel, conference center, spa, restaurants, and golf course.    Check in was a tad slow, but staff were very nice and asked questions to make sure the room would fit our family.  Being across the street from Kierland Commons allowed my wife and little girls to have something to do while attended to work events.  My wife, a connoisseur of fine beds, thought the beds were somewhat hard.  I thought it was perfect.    The conference center is top notch in terms of a comfortable, classy setting with attentive services people taking care of you.  Caught myself pausing to take in the beauty of the resort's views a couple times.  One memorable things is the food.  The dinners were truly exceptional and the lamb shank is something I'll remember for a while.  Magnificent!

Excellent Conference Experience  Was at the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch for a summit for the day. Truly a great experience: Staff was super friendly and helpful, the facility is immaculate, and the food was well above standard resort fare. When one conference goer mentioned they couldn't have milk, the staff called in for some alternative food with a smile; no fuss and couldn't have been more gracious. Even the A/V people were great as they mic'd us up for our panel!  The conference areas have a great design-- distinct architecture, lots of light, enjoyable patio areas to retreat to, and easy to navigate. +1 for the free charging locker stations. -1 for the pricey parking lot fee.   Will have to look at this place for a staycation from summertime...

Surprise gem  I had not heard of the Marriott at McDowell Mountain until a conference brought me there. Driving up, it doesn't catch your eye-- something of a modern Ottoman bazaar architecture that is marked by a large, rectangular facades. But, on the inside, you are treated to shaded archways with ornate courtyards, a very friendly staff, and bright, well-appointed spaces throughout the interior. It's truly a surprise how well the hotel uses the space to be large and welcoming one you move through the entryway.  Conference facilities were spacious and comfortable. The food was very good, supported by attentive staff who were both polite and polished in their handling of the meals. The walkways were well-lit and warm, inviting attendees to talk at length.  Views are stellar and there is relatively easy access to popular shopping areas and eateries. Planes close overhead will also catch your eye. My guess from the many executive to prop aircraft that we saw is that there is a small airport nearby. Not sure if that's a bad thing for people staying overnight.   The layout of the hotel required traversing floors, which was easy enough, A plus that may mean more to me than others was that the parking was in close proximity to the entryway and hub of access to the hotel's areas. I appreciate not having to trek a mile to get in and out.   Excellent facility and I'll look forward to another conference there...

Perfect  A colleague's sister passed away and we needed to send a nice stand of flowers for the next day. Ordered online and left instructions for the location of the services, contact person, and my information in case there were any questions.  Our colleague reached out after the ceremony to thank us for such a beautiful spray of flowers. It arrived on time, was large, and fit the somber occasion with a flare of color that fit his sister. His family was touched and he even sent us a picture.  Couldn't ask for anything more...

Fast service and fair pricing  My wife had a flat after something odd cause a metal shard to puncture her sidewall while driving.  We took it the our closest Discount Tire.   I thought the first quote sounded high.  So, we called around and found that their pricing was on par with everyone else.  Depending on the fees, it was a little higher than some, and a lot lower than others.  Turns out, tire prices have risen a good amount in the past two years.  I did like that they weren't offended that we wanted to call around to compare pricing.    Work was done quickly, despite them having to order the size tire we required from another store. Nice crew and very professional.

Top-notch facility, doctors, and options.  Bit more expensive.  Tried WVVC after going to Target optical for a few years and having a change of insurance.  This eye care group provides an exceptional service experience.  Staff is quick and helpful. Doctors really seem to know their stuff and they use better technology than I've seen in the past. (I'm a fan of anything that doesn't dilate my eyes!) And they have a wide array of options spanning cheap to couture.  Two knocks-- price compared to my previous spend on glasses and contacts is almost $100 more for very similar options.  Lenses on my glasses appears to be the bulk of that.  Also, I've had to hold on picking up my glasses after they came in at the wrong prescription.    Overall superb place and people.  We are switching my entire family over as patients.

Aging Target Boutique  My wife and I are fans of Target.  They have appealing products with some designer partnerships, prices are generally good, and basically because it's not Wally World. However, this location is showing its vintage.  Staff is fairly nice. Floors and the store layout are a throwback to the 1990s.  Shelves and aisles are not maintained like I'm accustomed to seeing, even at the store on Cotton Lane.  Truthfully, it can be a real mess to walk through.  This location is also not a Super Target, so selection is constrained.  That's especially true of the groceries department, which is mainly dry and frozen foods.  If they would update this location and upgrade staffing, it would rock.  It's close to the I-10 and a collection of restaurants we frequent; is the most proximal store to the large Palm Valley development where we live; and there's unused space on the store's existing footprint.  We shall see.

We were very impressed with this clinic.  Our cat had a wound on his paw and we took him in for care.  We're used to vets that say lots of services are needed and seem to try to guilt you in to extra bills, else be given disapproving looks that you're a big meanie if you tell them "no" and you don't deserve to have pets.  It doesn't work on my wife and I, but we've seen friends and co-workers lament falling into debt because of vets who rope them into a lot in a hurry.  In this case, the vet talked about what would be best for a pet at 18 years old, listened to his history and habits, and tried to be as considerate of family emotions as the decision process.  He had a quick surgery done in less than a half-hour.  Total cost was under $200, including the visit and antibiotics.  Cat was grumpy, growling, and walked around with a blue cast/sock he'd shake rapidly between steps, but he was good to go.  The Vet even took time to advise how the next few days would go and we checked in with each other a day later.  Classy people at Palm Valley Animal Clinic.  They just earned our business for our two dogs, as well.

Could not recommend them more  Since my last review, we had our 14-year-old Shepherd/Grayhound mix pass away. She lost lower body control, experienced seizures, and couldn't potty or eat.  We eventually had to make the decision to euthanize after watching her struggle so much one weekend.  The vet and his crew were amazingly kind and considerate. The emphasis was on making Chloie comfortable.  Our 13-year-old Cocker Spaniel, who was dealing with liver failure, stopped eating much directly after.  Working with the vet, we made her as comfortable as possible and spent a good amount of time playing a little and cuddling.  She just seemed to miss her "sister" too much and would lay in Chloie's spot and sniff around for her.  Malie died peacefully one morning, about two months later.  Again, the PVAC was supportive throughout-- meds to take away pain and keep some weight on, helped us take care of the body, no crazy procedures with little chance of success, and sent us a condolence card afterward.  So, in two months, we saw a world of compassion from Palm Calley Animal Clinic.  Animals and their families are respected in every way.  We were lucky to have found them.

They have a shredding service!  Was scouring the area for a shredding service to finally purge the receipts and records I've kept since college. This location has some locked bins from a service firm that does just that.   The two dudes manning the store were helpful, the charges were par for what I expected, and I got it all done in one quick visit. Can't ask much more than that.   Looks like the have mailing services and post boxes, as well. And not sure what it is, but while I was getting my papers in the bins for shredding, three customers who were there to mail stuff griped at the staff about the prices to overnight or express things. And meanly. Credit to them for handling it well.

Still tops, but more delays   I'm a fan of Southwest on the bases of their on-time scores, low lost luggage rates, I-can-do-it staff attitude, and overall cost.  The queue system for seating doesn't bother me and I find it worth the Early Bird fee to get on a bit sooner.  The math is that it's a very effective way to administer a variable demand system.  My only knock is that after many flights with no delays, I've seen three delays on recent trips.  We ended up making up some time in the air on two of those flights, which is cool.  Just hoping it's not a pattern.

Most expensive and getting more so; Extra fees; Average speed and up time  Went with Cox based on the JD Power scores.  They must be from an old survey.  I did the installation myself and the connection still did not work.  Cox sent a technician out who found that the technician who disconnected the previous people in our house left something attached wrong.  Then I get a charge for his visit even though he marked it was their error.  Called their customer service and they marked me to have the charge reversed.  Never happened.  Tried again and still nothing.  Speed is okay and up time is generally fine.  Nothing special.  This is HFC internet and they've been doing it for 15+ years.  It's average technology at best.  More recently, they've gone from $50/month to $56/month.  As of November, it's $63/month.    So: More expensive and getting even pricier.  Using old technology.  And shady fee practices.  I can't believe I'm actually going to switch to CenturyLink!

Hooray!  A market with fresh kimchee selections...  Visited after eating at Cafe GH for lunch.  Nice little market with friendly people.  Unlike many markets, these folks have good prices on basics and don't overcharge.    Best kimchee selection we've found in Phoenix.  Options range from cabbage, cucumber, and sprouts to tofu and seaweed varieties.  They also sell kim bap (kind of Korean california rolls), which makes for a good lunch to go.  Now, if I can just find a place that sells milk tea/gogo no kocha...

Fun time in an Arizona faux-hamlet!  We've been to RenFes events in a few states and generally enjoy them a great deal. The ARF is no different. It's actually an amazing mix of architecture, ambience, cool entertainers, shops, and more snacks than you can shake a sword or wand at.   Parking was easy enough, though the traffic getting in was HORRENDOUSLY slow. Once at the entrance gates, the flow is quick and lets you wander. For the price of admission, you can really spend a whole day, here.   We bought a Hermione wand for my elder daughter, dragon wings for our two-year old, and a mix of snacks. My 8 year-old even bought a fiction book from one of the writers there, had her book for sale at the bookstore. Oh, and lots of samples of desserts and cold drinks.    The drummers were entertaining-- our little one still yells Babaloo!-- on occasion. The tightrope gal was also funny. The puppet dude was not funny for those of us with little ones. Jokes about drugs and addiction habits don't create laughter and do cause a lot of unnecessary questions from pre-teens. But, he was the exception.   Definitely worth a visit!

Flippin' fun family time  Visited for the birthday of our daughter's friend. Had never heard of the place, but glad we visited.  After some minor disorganization at Admissions, we visited the Office and were quickly led to the birthday cabana for our group.  Started off in the young kids area. The girls all enjoyed the small- to mid-sized slides and 2-ft pool.  Always have some kids who misbehave and whose parents aren't around.  They were not common though, so won't hold Big surf responsible for a few bad eggs.    We did inherit a little girl who jumped on one of our rafts, followed by her grandma yelling "It's okay" to our group. Chose not to tell her that would be our call as she seemed like a nice (albeit bored) kid.  We sent her back after about 30 minutes of playing as it was pizza time.   Staff was very attentive at the birthday party.  Afterward, the girls worked their way up to the taller slides.  Despite some fear, the kiddos all got in rafts and did at least one tall ride. Lifeguards and other visitors were very nice with the girls showing some trepidation.  They helped make the day a success.  Then, it was on to the wave pool, which is a congested cluster of people waiting for occasional big waves.  We hung out near the "shore" as so many people were bouncing into each other and because our six year-olds are only okay swimmers.  Saw a concussion. Had two people with rafts ride waves into us.  And had to tell some kids not to be so rough around little ones.  Still, the girls all had a blast and didn't want to leave when the whistle blew.   Yay!  We'll have to go, again.

Good water softener and service  Bought the Krystal Pure water softener at Lowes.  The staff seem to be fans of the units compared to other manufacturers' products.  Scheduling was easy and they arrived bright and early a few days later for the install.  They secured the necessary permits, communicated well, offered to take the broken softener, explained operations clearly, and gave me the numbers for fast response if anything went wrong.  Nothing did and everything passed Goodyear inspections cleanly when they came out.  Warranty terms are very strong compared to the large manufacturers.  You pay more for the device and less for the install, oddly enough.  I haven't had to use the warranty service, so can't say if they do a good job on the post-installation support.

Bonus points for just being Hawaiian food in the West Valley!    Plate lunches are good and what you'd expect if you call Hawai'i home.  Normal fare and combinations.  Service is okay, but ends at the counter.  Time from order to pickup can also be long, translating into the food sometimes being lukewarm.  When the crew is on, the food is very good.  However, we've also had some bland pork, fatty and meatless short ribs, and overcooked chicken on occasion.  Kind of like a luau back home...  Portions are the normal Hawaiian-style generous.  Cost is a little higher, but not bad.  The owner is a very nice lady and it's always fun to support franchisees like this.

Nice Updates and Sales Staff  I remember shopping at Kohl's in the Midwest in college. Always wondered how they offered things at such deep discounts, but the bottom line was the prices helped clothe my poor student self. Winter required layers!  Had not been to Kohl's since their remodel. We needed to get some things for our growing girls and I was pleasantly surprised. Nothing too drastic mind you, but they have improved the layout and made the spaces brighter. In terms of clothing, the staple lines are still there-- Chaps, Sonoma, Apt 9, Croft and Barrow, Elle, Lee, Levi, Nike, and Adidas. They are also mixing in some name brands like Rock and Republic, nice Vera Wang stuff my wife liked (and looked great on her), Juicy Couture, and Jennifer Lopez/Marc Anthony.   In all, I like the new store layout, they've refreshed the clothing lines fairly well, and the service staff were pleasant.

Impressive and helpful staff  Looking to buy a couple smartphones for Christmas, my wife and I stopped in this Verizon store for help. Carlos helped us as and impressive in his understanding of everything from devices to billing cycles to plan features.   Some specifics: 1) I received an email about some discounts for the holidays. At first, the system said they couldn't be stacked. I watched Carlos try multiple ways of doing the order and he found a way to make it happen in the Verizon system. An average sales person would have given up.  2) When Carlos noticed we were one day away from our billing cycle, he recommended we come back the next day, in order to avoid a billing period charge for only one day of difference. 3) When the store didn't have the right models to sell, Carlos also gave up the order to staff at another store without a second thought, so long as we got what we needed. The sale went to a girl at the 99th & McDowell Verizon store. She was just short of helpless and actually made an error that caused us to have to return. 3) Wanting to avoid the manager and staff at the 99th & McDowell Verizon store because of their ineptness, we returned to the Dysart and I-10 store. Carlos noticed us in the busy gaggle of people, swung over to check, and apologized he couldn't help since he was with other customers, But, he and the manager got us connected with the service desk staff, who started working on fixing the problem created by the 99th & McDowell Verizon store. Our wait to be helped was about 15 minutes-- understandable given the post-Christmas crowd. 4) Josue and the manager decided to reissue us pins. Josue went through the process, made the hardware changes, tested multiple times on both phones to confirm, and kept things moving for us.  This is the best experience I've had with a carrier, much less their store. They listen, are attentive, and communicate with you through the process. Most important, you get what you are looking for in the end while feeling you are a priority. If not for the crowd and (understandable) waits, I'd give them a perfect score. They were THAT helpful.

Mmmm.  Milk butterfat + candy.  The Blizzard is one of the great American inventions.  Nice kids staffing the place, marginally clean store, and they have soft-serve ice cream with peanut butter cups and M&Ms.    I think my pregnant wife would singlehandedly keep them in business.  It's also one of the few things our little girl will offer to spend her own money on if we can go. :o)

Was hoping for a great experience  My seven year-old is an IHOP fanatic. She'll notice every one we pass by and wax poetic about the chocolate smiley face pancakes. So, we were really hoping this store would be great since it's a long trek to the others in the Valley and our visit was a reward for our daughter having a good performance.  On the positive, the service people were very nice. VERY SLOW, but very nice.   Beyond that, my daughter barely ate her pancakes as she said they didn't taste good. Similarly, my wife and I commented to each other that the food was off in taste and temperature.    The delay being seated, long stretches between visits by our waitress, and time waiting for our bill added up. Syrup containers were super sticky. Booth seats were a tad messy. And we had to ask twice about the kids eating free to get things to register correctly.   This IHOP isn't bad. It's just missing the service speed and attention to detail to make it a place you want to stop in at for a meal.

Quick and cheap  I've been to this car wash a few times, always for the high option drive-through wash with no interior detailing. It's a breeze each time. I pull up, they show me the menu, I pick, they mark my window as I pay, and zoom, I pull up and go through. MUCH better wash than a gas station for about the same cost.   Groovy cool...

Excellent equestrian-istic experience  What a gem in the West Valley!  Wanted to take a relative from out of the country horseback riding to enjoy the desert. I had seen the WTRS sign when driving by for hikes and then caught their stellar reviews on Yelp! So, we signed three of us up for a ride, including a precocious seven year old.   The crew genuinely seems to enjoy their job and Debbie made logistics a breeze. Kayla was our guide: A sweet cowgirl who made the ride informative and fun. The horses were all good natured and the trip was beautiful.   We'll visit again for our girls to enjoy the stables more.  One tip: The hour ride is excellent for people who don't ride, often. Much longer and people were regretting the sensations in their knees and on their rears.

Excellent shopping... even if you feel like Igor hanging with Barbie and Ken  Great shopping mall with about all the stores you look for-- Apple, Microsoft, Godiva, Clark's, all the clothes stores.  Parking is a snap and they have some cool eateries-- 5 Guys, Modern Steak, and others on the other block.  Very clean and good for some exercise while people watching.  Main drawback is that there are so many Barbie and Ken type people.  It's like Gattica!  First, they all look alike.  Second, I feel like I should be walking in the average peoples' lane and avoiding eye contact, lest the pretty people feel put upon.  Dang genetic lottery...

Below par for an upper-end hotel  My wife and I stayed for the long Memorial Day weekend.  Great lobby and nice hotel staff got things off to a fun start.  They have a nice selection of good restaurants, the pool area is not a large pool where people are trying to hook up, and the rooms are grand.  A few things that really knocked our experience down from where it should have been.  First, when we got to our room, something smelled funny.  I finally tracked it down to some leftovers a previous guest had left in the fridge.  And by leftovers, I mean stink wad of mold-covered something.  I called down, the guest desk apologized meekly, and they sent someone to pick it up from the spot I put it outside our door.    Next, we were originally booked at the Palazzo.  They asked if we would move to the Venetian and I said sure to be nice. The room was still fine, but the bellhops had a bad attitude about having to make the trip.  One asked if we'd just pull our car around to the Venetian so he wouldn't have to walk so far.  I told him no thank you and that the hotel asked us to work with them.  He didn't complain any more, but the damage was done.    Last, when I checked us out at the desk, there was a bill for dinner at the Grand Lux Cafe and about nine beers on our folio.  Problem was the dinner charges were while were were eating with our families elsewhere in the hotel.  And neither my wife nor I drink.  I told them it could theoretically have been my 5-year old, but she never smelled like beer and it's hard to imagine her picking up a drinking habit so early in life. The charges were reversed.  Still, one doesn't expect those kinds of shocks at a hotel the caliber of The Venetian/The Palazzo.  Again, it is generally a very nice hotel that just misses on its execution.  Oh, and the pervasive cigarette smoke made us yearn for Denver or San Diego.  Not the hotel's fault on that though, and we ended up making rounds in th Canal Shops and Forum Shops a lot to avoid the smoking.  My wife and I agreed we would probably try the place again if there were a deal, but will otherwise look at Bellagio, Wynn, or the like, next time we visit Vegas.

Good French food, average service  Stopped into Mon Ami Gabi on a vacation to Vegas.  My wife and I thought it was superb 11 years ago and were happy to see they are still in business.  We both recalled how much we loved their French Onion Soup.  With some relatives coming down the street, I was disappointed by the young lady managing the hostess desk.  She wouldn't even say if or how long our wait was, "Unless your full party is here."  I could understand not being seated, but the rude tone and nonsensical retort that they can't even give you an estimate on wait time got things off to a poor start.  Then, we were seated immediately when our family members arrived.  The menu is simple enough and the food was good, but not great.  Salads were unremarkable.  The Fillet Mignon was very good.  And the final bill was about $205 for four adults, a toddler, and a baby.  Note: They put 18% gratuity on for themselves.  There were much better years ago.  And if there were better service, I would readily give them three stars.

Excellent food... but for the slow service  Was excited to try Bouchon as a Thomas Keller fan.  To be upfront, Bouchon is no French Laundry.  The latter blew me away whereas, Bouchon was excellent but unremarkable.    I had the chicken and waffles, which were superb and the waffles threw me for a happy loop with the bacon specks cooked in and the flavored butter.  Other folks in our family had rave reviews for the Tartine de Thon, Bouchon French Toast, and trout dish.  Gravlax and Croque de Madame were said to be good.  Service staff was very nice, though remarkably slow in their execution.  Couple criticisms:  (1) Service was exceptionally slow!  Ordering took about 25 minutes.  It was about 50 minutes before food was on the table.  And paying was the equivalent of a race with your chunky buddy on your back.  All in all, our dining experience took about 2.5 hours.   (2) The Bouchon Pastry Basket was grocery store caliber.  Two of the flavors came back as unavailable.  Then, when the platter did arrive, they all had cold centers.  Seriously, for $13 for four pastries, I would expect thorough reheating. (3) We sat in the back right and with things taking so long, the sun was hitting us hard.  My cousin and I started eating lunch with our sunglasses on.  As the temperature on my phone crossed 90-degrees, I called over the staff and asked to either move or have them pull some kind of shade.  They kindly put an outside umbrella against the window which helped greatly.  They were very kind in responding.  I would have liked it more if they had thought ahead reacted to our discomfort without being asked.  We aren't the only ones who have eaten at the table.  In sum, excellent food, slow service, nice staff, a few knocks on food preparation, and a some small doubts on quality for the price.

Great spot for a work lunch!  Cibo had been on my list for a while. Had a chance to eat their for a work lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff is attentive, food options are appealing, and the ingredients used all combine for a very appealing feast. Orders, drinks and bread, and meals all hit our table with perfect timing.  We had the Margherita Pizza and a Capri Salad. Both were excellent. The pizza bread was perfect and they did not make an oily mess of the cheese. The flavors of the cheese and sausage (I added) came through nicely, without overpowering. My colleage commented that her salad was fresh and also excellent.   Will be back to try some other option!

S'okay.  A bit expensive and not authentic.  Hit L&L with the fam and left missing shops back in the islands even more.  BBQ plate was good enough.  The meat wasn't too fatty, and the rice and mac salad were good.  Hawaiian Sun Passion Orange drinks were expensive, though.  My wife had the chicken katsu and kalua pork, which she didn't enjoy.  Pork was dry and too salty while the katsu chicken meat was fatty and had some extra gristle for our pleasure.    My 6 year-old had the saimin with chicken and egg.  She picked at it as it was bland and the egg yolk was a tad raw.  Overall, it is nothing like back home in Hawai'i.  The boba tea she had was a drink with ice and the tapioca was old/deteriorating.  I've never seen her stop drinking a boba tea, before.    Bathroom was a wreck.  More than anything, it turned me off eating.  L&Ls used to be so dependable for good Hawaiian food.  So hit-and-miss these days.

Just like their furniture-- Bright, Fun, Easy, Cheap, and Sticks with You Longer than it Should  Not sure why the Ikea cafe is so fun. It's not haute cuisine by any stretch. Could be the simplicity of it, the pretty good taste, or the quantity for the cost.  Then again, it may be that kids take to the cafe like Lindon Berry to white fabrics.  Whatever the case, we stop by every time were in Ikea for at least a bite of food.  Specifically, the kids love the cakes, mac and cheese, chicken fingers, Lindon Berry juice boxes... You know, as I think this, I'm realizing that they pretty much like everything.    My wife and I don't mind the chicken or even the meatballs. And the holiday meal packages look like great deals, though we've never actually bought one.

If Ikea were a cult, I'd have to join  Ikea seems to be one the cultural meccas of our area and times. Want to wander and see what you can do with your abode? Check! Need and odd kitchen utensil/plates/flatware set? Gjort! Hungry for a tasty, ration-like plate of meatballs/chicken strips/cake? Kontrollera! Just want to people watch? Take all day. There are some interesting ones in the crowds!   we stopped in for some furniture options and to purchase bathroom peripherals. We found what we needed and bought about twice what we intended. Kitchen, casita, and pantry all have do-ups, now. Also ended up eating dinner and that almond cake thing was yummers.  We have made our offerings and will look forward to the next mass...

Bonanza of Boo-Ya BBQ  A friend had recommended Joe's as a BBQ staple in the Valley for years. We swung by after the Peach Fest. Nice place and the food was super yums!  Joe's is in a brick storefront in a hopping part of Gilbert's downtown, across the street from Postino, cater-cornered from Liberty Market and The Farmhouse, and down the street from Oregano's and LoLo's.   My wife, kids, and I had a mix of food-- Sampler Plate, Half-Slab, and Kid's Sandwich Meal. All received positive reviews. As with any BBQ place, it's really about the meat. It's good stuff with a smoky flavor, tasty charring, and oh so tender. All passed the falls-off-the-bone test. The BBQ sauces are warm and are good, though a they are a tad sweet for my tastes. If you're the same, the spicy BBQ sauce option balances the sweetness some. Potato salad and coleslaw were also good.   Definitely a go-to place for your BBQ list. That said, I was told this place can get crazy busy. We apparently hit it at the right time because a fairly long line developed as we were eating.

Very good for a work lunch  Stopped in for a business and some food with a colleague.  We sat in a booth by the bar and the staff were quick with our orders, checked in with us regularly, and were very polite.  Interior design has a nice, modern look and was very clean.    I never look to be blown away by the food at these chain places.  However, their chicken pot pie lunch is very tasty and the crust was actually cooked perfectly.    Had a good meeting and lunch was well above par for a chain.  Definitely will go again.

Best macaroons in the Valley  Heard about Essence's macaroons from a friend and hit the place up.  It's a small shop-- maybe 12 table tops total, plus a bakery case near the cash register.  The selection of pastries is small, but excellent.  We took a to-go order of a dozen macaroons, a small sweets box, a carmel-sugar pastry, and a ginger soda.  All rocked.  The macaroons are everything they were cracked up to be.  The carmel-sugar thing made my little girl's day, though I thought the sweetness and slight liquor finish were a bit much.  And the sweets box of small cookies and tarts was perfect to share as dessert for dinner.  Can't say anything about the restaurant part of the shop.  Ooh, but they did have big macaroons (maybe 3.5" in diameter), which I have never seen, before.  Lady who took care of us at the register was very nice.

Enjoyed Christmas at the Princess!  I've been to the FSP for conferences in the past at it has been great. Excellent food, enjoyabe patio dining with good service, and some views of a beautiful golf course.  Just stopped in for Christmas at the Princess and our daughters had a hoot! Carolers were cool and the holiday lighting was pretty throughout the resort. The shops had Christmas fare. The fire pits made for a fun 40 minutes of warming up while cooking s'mores. Ice skating was neat to watch, though our girls weren't feeling up to trying it. And the walk around the lagoon was nice family time.  We did try to take the "train". The line was super long (1+ hours) and our girls lost interest after seeing it. We took the same route as the train on foot (around the lagoon) and then hit the light show area.  Excellent choice for a visit, though not unique enough to merit making a tradition out of it. That said, we may look at staying there for Christmas next year. It would make for a memorable experience...

Excellent traditional mall  Fashion Center in Chandler is one of the top two traditional malls in the Phoenix Metro area.  Great collection of stores ranging from mid-tier to near-luxury, clean, and large enough to wander a bit for some people watching and shopping.    Oh, and they have the best boba tea place in the Valley!

Sweet cafe... and a mecca for carb lovers  My little girl and I hit Wildflower every other week on our daddy-daughter day.  It's a nice diversion from the fast food places she usually gravitates towards (dang you marketers!).  Sandwiches, soups, and salads are all tasty.  Dessert bar is uber yum.  The layout is comfortable for eating and chatting.  And they have seasonal special-order baked goods-- e.g., cross buns for Easter, cupcakes for Valentines, pastries for Mother's Day, et al.  Only knock is the ordering can be a bit slow.

Horrible pharmacy  As a first-time user of the pharmacy, they dogged it.  I dropped off my Rx and the young lady gives the impression she is doing you a favor to have your business.  Curt with little information offered as I validated my insurance is accepted.    You apparently have to wait until the next business day to pick things up, so know it could be a few days lag.  If your order is urgent, you may want to go somewhere that understands time.  Fortunately, my order wasn't urgent.  And then they never called that the Rx was in.  We happened to be there for groceries, so I checked in.

Busy, tasty, and courteous staff for Dim Sum!  Dim sum is hard to come by in Phoenix.  Even more so good dim sum.  That's odd given the size of the Phoenix-Metro area and the asian/pacific islander population.  Phoenix Palace helps fill that hole in a shopping area that seems to be our version of Asian Town.  Food and experience are what you know if you've lived in China, only minus the grand hall.  Pastries, seaweed salad, duck, sui mai, noodle and rice dished, bok choi, and other servings were all yummers, cooked well, and with fast-paced fun.  Clean restaurant and it was fun watching the nine year-old hostess manage the surges of customers.  Staff was quick and accommodating.  As usual with dim sum, it can add up and become expensive if you get careless with taking too much.  Affordable if you don't go crazy.  We'll be back...

Stopped in for the pie. And it was good.  Family had the hankering for pie to celebrate the New Year. Ran up th road to Village Inn. The service staff was cool and I procured a Triple Berry and a Peppermint French Silk. Arrived home to much fanfare and squealing from my wife... and little girls. If only being a hero was really this easy.  Seriously, the pies were good and the crusts were perfect. We'll be back.

Magnificent Maternity Ward  My wife and I just returned from having our baby delivered at Banner Estrella.    Delivery doctors and nurses communicated well and were open throughout the surgery.  Baby was born healthy and they followed our baby plan.  Transition to the maternity ward went swimmingly and it was hard not to be impressed by the strong processes in place-- shift changes, confirming med times, checking in on baby and mother, taking diagnostics, ensuring I was with our baby when the work had to be done outside of the room.  Post-op comments on the doctor's work on my wife was positive from multiple docs.  Heck, even the food at the cafeteria was good.  Do wish the maternity ward rooms were more hospitable for significant others.  For example, a more comfortable bed (or even king-sized family bed), fridge, and bathroom space for a few toiletries would have made it about perfect.  The surgery area is starting to show its age and is a bit cramped.  Other than that, the staff was excellent all around.    Bottom line: Impressive experience because of a truly wonderful medical staff.  And the new wing will be a great addition for the maternity ward come 2015.  We were bumped twice because of a mass of deliveries.  Still worked out superbly.

Fun shopping site for high-end stores  Kierland Commons has some uncommon stores ad restaurants that we visit on occasion.  iPic is the best movie experience in town.  I'm a fan of True Foods and Zinc Bistro.  They have the best Apple Store in the region.  And the clothing stores are good for splurging.  Mall layout is also nice when the weather is good.  During the summer, it's a drag to be out there in the extreme heat.    And if you want to see a bunch of people with Ferrari, Maserati, Porsche, and an occasional Lambo, this is definitely your place.

Costco Tire Department leaves much to be desired...  My wife's car needed new tires.  We like shopping in Avondale and headed over to Costco.  The guy who sold the tires was nice enough and seemed knowledgeable about tires. Installation was completed quickly.  That's the good news.   The problem we had was that we received an ad later than day about the same tires being available for about $25 cheaper.  Went back to the store expecting the great service you hear about from Costco.  I didn't find it.  And I really tried.  The store staff relayed that Costco does not price match.  They then offered take our new tires as a return with a refund minus the installation and disposal fee.  Asking why they would keep the disposal fee, they said they wouldn't be able to find our original tires to put back on.  I questioned how I would be able to drive away if they didn't give our tires back, one technician said he didn't know.  Not believing these to be intelligent answers, I spoke with a manager.  After talking it through, she shared that didn't make sense, but was all they could offer.  I'm still not sure if that was supposed to make me feel better or worse.    I emailed Costco customer services online and got no response after a week.  Bottom line: Not the best prices. Don't stand behind their prices. Offers a frustrating customer service experience. Has service staff who are nice, but unable/unwilling to do much.

Perfect for the little kids' haircuts  Our baby girl had her first birthday and we had to get her first haircut to match. Found Snip-Its as the top rated place around for children.  Ended up getting our 6 year-old's hair done, as well.  Place is designed for kids with a fun setting and rewards for when they are done.  Our little girl was not a fan of the haircut concept, but the stylist handled it perfectly.  As for our big girl... Well, she said she still likes to get her nails and pedis done at the spa with Mommy, but liked this place for her hair.  That's high praise from a first-grader.

Good spot for patio dining  Have only ever been to HGI for meetings and breakfast/lunch on the patio. That said, the staff is always super-friendly and the food is better than most hotels. The meeting rooms and patio are clean and inviting. The patio fireplace is a great spot for conversing with colleagues between sessions on cooler mornings. (If only it was a no-smoking zone.)  Would recommend for meetings and business travelers. Have had some consultants stay at HGI and all reports are that it's a comfortable stay with easy access to things.

Good and fast... food  Some coworkers and I rely on this place as a regular standby for Chinese food.  Portions are reasonably large and the dishes are flavorful. All things being relative in the West Valley, this place is top-five for Chinese restaurants.  Not a haute eatery by any means. More like a side diner you would find in a large city.   The ladies who run the place and nice and quick. The Mongolian Beef is my and a coworker's go-to dish.  Lunch Special with a soda will run you about $11 with tip.

Simply superb  With a new house come many locks to change to be safe.  Looked up the best-rated locksmiths on Yelp and called the top three.  Two made is sound like grief to come to the West Valley.  Fortunately, Jeff was a real pro and set a time with us.  We were very impressed.  He stayed true to his estimate, was fast, made us extra keys, labeled sets, and even did extra work to ensure the bolt lock was flush on a back door to make sure it locked correctly.    Jeff communicates well, follows through, and had very fair charges.  He even interacted well with our curious little girl.  She's usually very wary of visitors.  We are sticking with him as our locksmith...

The saving grace of airlines!  Staff is straightforward and considerate.  They have the best on-time rates and lose your luggage the least.  Boarding is short and sweet... though I pay for the Early Bird option to get my pick.  They don't try to bleed you dry with fees.  And the free wifi is a nice add.  I've seen so many bad experiences with United, US Air, American, and the like.  Until I can afford to fly on chartered planes, I'm sticking with Southwest.  They are the best airline around.

VERY dangerous place-- Stay away if you must use the words "diet" or "thinner"  Had never heard of Julia Baker, before.  Yet, in the Fashion Park for a birthday lunch for my wife around the corner, we stumbled upon this beautiful little shop.  It's part chocolate art boutique and part sensory nirvana.    The front section has two cases of chocolates-- Bailey's Irish Cream, ganache, champagne, and others.  The rear has a sitting area and caf√©.  Upon entry, my wife and our 16-month old both let out an "Ooooooooh!"  And the ladies in the back both yell, "That's what we said!"  The samples melt in your mouth and take a breath away.  We bought two selections so everyone in out family could make a couple of choices for their treats.  And when I asked how the staff could make sure our purchase didn't experience a Phoenix heat-related death, the store clerk said they pack with dry ice.  Perfect!  The staff will tell you the success Julia Baker is having on a TV cooking channel.  No wonder as the images of her cakes and specialty desserts are stunning. A visit is worth putting on your bucket list and then immediately knocking off.  It may even be worth a change in religions, depending on your life choices.  Oh, we WILL be back...  ----  Update: Was at Capital Grill for a meeting. On my way out, bought a box of Julia Baker for my wife and daughters. You'd have thought I conquered Rome when I got home and they saw the treats. It was a mini-parade!

Good Food + Service with an Organic Spin  Stopped in to celebrate a friend's birthday and had not heard of Picazzo's, prior. We were pleasantly surprised on entering-- comfortable but colorful interior was inviting; patio seating was appealing; and the service staff greeted us kindly. We were seated immediately by Elliott.   We were able to order drinks and appetizers. We had the Caprese, baked BBQ wings, Siracha slaw, and cheese bread (free on Yelp! check in) hit the table with a minimum wait. All were very good, though general feeling was that the slaw was a bit milky and bland, and the wings were a tad too sweet. Still good, though.    For the meal, we went with a Vortex pizza, a ravioli, and a Mac & Cheese. Excellent stuff! And Elliott was cordial while he checked on us regularly. Never did our drinks go empty, nor were we ever left waiting. And he was super nice to our little girls.   We'll be back!

Good for a boba tea fix  Always up for a tasty boba tea.  This place is usually hopping and the nice staff has a very quick turnaround to get you back out the door.  Boba are a little over cooked some times and many options are super sweet, but the teas are tasty and the selection is fun for my little girl.  Definitely worth the visit.  Do not expect to be blown away by any subtle flavors or premium teas.  Those from Taiwan or part of Cali might find Boba Tea House offerings to be more like candied teas.

Quick, Clean Cut by a Pro Barber  Was in the area for dinner and stopped in. I only go with places with real barbers due to some bad experiences in the past. I had also read some good things in Phoenix Magazine's Best of issue about this place.  A gal checked me in, invited me to take a seat, and asked it I wanted some water. She said it would be just a few minutes, so I took a seat. Very comfortable, lots of magazines and TVs, and a pool table in the back. I wasn't seated long before a barber finished up and invited me over.   Hank cut my hair and we got to exchange some stories about Chicago. Cut my hair perfectly in about 20 minutes while I watched How It's Made... on TV.   Will be back!

Chef-created eats + Upscale Cafe = Yummers  Have walked by Nordstrom's Cafe many times thinking, well, it's a cafe.  Co-worker mentioned how much she and her family like it, so thought to give it a try recently while at the mall.  'Lo!  It is good.  Main categories are sandwiches/paninis, salads, larger entrees, and desserts.  My wife and our 10-month-old loved the fish and grilled (and moist!) vegetables.  Our 6-year-old cleaned off her plate of mac and cheese with a side of fruit.  And my experience with the prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich with salad was very good.  Their vinaigrette options are numerous and excellent.  Service was very pleasant both in ordering and the wait staff.  We'll be back.

Finally, a quality dry cleaner  After trying a good majority of the dry cleaners in the Avondale-Goodyear area to major disappointment, my wife turned to Bell about a year ago.  Now, instead of getting dress shirts back that look like they were used as work therapy for drunk monkeys, Bell sends back crisp shirts.  And they even understand the term "light" starch!    My wife goes out of her way to take our stuff to Bell.  She has a soft sport for the gentleman who owns the shop-- on rare occasion there is a flaw (I'm picky), he graciously apologizes and makes takes care of it.  And when she was pregnant, he would insist on carrying everything out to her car for her.  No more cardboard-ish apparel for me, buddy!  I can now walk freely and not have people think I'm mimicking Robocop.    They have solid and appreciative customers in us...

Not great and not horrible  Went for lunch with my wife.  Wings were sour and had little meat on the bones.  Service was slow.  Drinks were empty for extended periods, then refilled with things we didn't order.  Sandwiches were sloppy and lacked flavor.  Restaurant is marginally clean.  Prices are higher than the quality and service by a lot.    Was edible, though.

What a freaking fun little spot!    Our family had a great breakfast at this restaurant and service was very good.  The beignets were a hit with my daughter and wife.  Waffles were a perfect crisp on the edges and loaded on top with fruit and real whipped create.  Syrup tastes like cinnamon buns.  My wife's quiche was cooked to perfection with airy egg and perfectly infused cheese flavor.  And my crepe with ham and swiss cheese was amazingly tasty, large, and filling enough that I only ate half.  I wanted to finish it, I just couldn't    We'll be heading back and hoping to catch when they do their French Onion Soup...  One oddity: We had called ahead and were told they did not take reservations.  When we arrived and asked for a table, they asked if we had reservations.  Chatting with them, it sounds like they do take reservations in the winter/spring (snowbird season) and they apologized for any confusion.  Space is at a premium at this spot, so call ahead.

Excellent traditional diner breakfast  Saw great reviews of RHG on Yelp! and a bit in Phoenix Magazine. So, knocked it off my list when my cousin was in town and we met up for breakfast.   Since RHG's chili verde was noted as extra special, I went with the R.H.G. Huevos Rancheros. My cousin went with the Pork Chili Verde Omelet. YUMS! This is real comfort food in the morning.   Serving sizes are substantial. Service was quick and she made sure things landed together while keeping drinks topped off. And the crowd feels like old-town America, where the waitress new a lot of them as regulars.

Great burger, value, and service  I'm one of those people who heard such amazing things about In-N-Out from friends who were acolytes that pretty much nothing could live up to the hype. And I heard it for YEARS.   Today, I hit In-N-Out for a great burger and an amazing price, even though it's not the religious experience some rank it as. Literally. For a few on my colleagues and friends, ordering a "Double-Double" is a straight-up analog for taking sacrament.  A few things I like about In-N-Out are that the chain keeps the food simply and yummers; the staff is almost always super fast and friendly (not like some chains that seem to hire anyone with a pulse); the store is kept clean;  and they get the orders right. OMFG on the latter item. It the core job of anyone in the service industry to create and accurate order, and yet, I can count the restaurants that do it well on two hands.

Yummy Thai!  Looking for dinner in the area, we would have this place had it not been for Yelp! and the positive reviews.  After locating it next to the Starbucks, we parked and piled in.    Service was fast and polite.  There's a good menu full of options that should cover every palate.  The patio setting on a nice night is not pretty.  But, you're there for the food/service and not the sights, right?  The meal: 1) Apps: Tom yum soup and chicken satay were tasty.  I'm not usually a fan of peanut sauces, but theirs rocked.   2) The salad and dressing also received compliments around the table.  3) Yellow Curry with chicken, Siamese Salad, Beef Thai Basil, and fried rice (for our little girl) all made our group happy.  Flavors are excellent, meats were tender and flavorful, and the portion sizes were perfect.  We'll definitely visit this place, again.

Fun and beautiful ballpark for some spring training action  Have caught two games and  am really impressed with Surprise Stadium.  The City of Surprise has done a superb job of creating a family-friendly area-- the stadium, library, park, City Hall campus, and residential areas show Surprise is a wonderful community.  Parking at the stadium is a breeze and traffic isn't bad.  Getting into the ballpark and to your seats is a breeze, except for the occasional delays at Will Call.  The staff/volunteers struggled both time with visitors in front of me.  Prices are reasonable, especially if you compare to the big stadiums.  Gem or a park and am a fan...

Some Aloha on a cold, wet March afternoon  Very much enjoyed the festival. Lots of vendors to sate the yearn for island food-- manapua, lau lau, katsu, lomi lomi salmon, POG, haupia, kalua pork, huli huli chicken, and all the staples were available.  Also had some interesting new items like mac + white chocolate cookie ice cream sandwiches with coconut ice cream and a teriyaki/katsu chicken stick. (Spell check is going to make me go through all of that, isn't it?)  Dancers are a mix of very good to average, but still very fun. Our daughter was enthralled.  And the spirit was there to make it a warm event despite the weather.  Make you miss home if you're from Hawai'i.  Location is also family friendly.  Downtown Tempe is a great location for walking, eating, and spending time with each other.  We will be back!

Great food and value  Visited with employees to celebrate one's birthday. We all opted for bentos and it's amazing how much food you get for the money.  We all waddled away content... once we managed to pry ourselves from our chairs.  Tomo's has the usual variety of bento options-- all have some tempura and a ginger-dressing salad, some maki sushi, and meat options. Our group had the A, B, C, and E.  They offer one of the best bentos around and the sushi was surprisingly good.  I'm used to very hit-and-miss experiences with sushi in the Valley.  Truthfully, much more miss.  I also compelled the young men to sing Happy Birthday to our birthday boy. You could tell it wasn't their thing, but they didn't hesitate to give it a go.  It was a sad, off key rendition by all of us at the table.  Not a lick of harmony, but scored a 25% tip for earnest effort and fried ice cream with delicately placed candles!  Will be back to try, again.

Our go-to place for fresher food fare  When it comes to fresh vegetables and fruit, there really aren't a lot of good options.  Most major markets sell stuff that has been atmospherically treated and controlled to look good, but is in fact old and plucked before it should have been for transportation purposes.  They also have a "healthier" selection of processed foods.  Sprouts gets us as close to tasty and healthy groceries as possible.  If you lead a busy life and strive to hit the healthy mark without investing a lot of time into research and an apothecary-type lifestyle, Sprouts is a reliable option.    We trust what they have on the shelves, cases, and displays.  Meats are delicious and cost a bit more.  Fruits and vegetables are flavorful... and are actually cheaper than competitors when we've compared.  Selection of nuts, fruits, and grains is perfect for our needs.  And while we don't visit the organic supplements area much, it's stocked full of things that should appeal to those who know what all that stuff is for.   My only knocks: Relatively slow cashiers, people don't know how to bag (more an indictment of all stores these days), and slow response at the deli case.

A Top Option in the Valley for Asian Fare  Super L (and Lee Lees) are the standard go-to places for Asian groceries in the Valley. Super L is cleaner, more compact, brighter, and doesn't have quite the spread of options-- e.g., not as many rows, no fresh fish section, etc. That said, I generally see higher quality goods at Super L. Another nice feature is that the area hosts cultural events and festivals throughout the year.   Other pros: Good seasonal selection Nice bakery Fun mix of people who shop there Restaurant serves whole duck!

Best movers you can get  Recently used Camelback based on their amazing Yelp scores.  Heck, I know they handled Yelp's own move to their Scottsdale office.  Office staff was fast to respond and they send you supplemental information on what to expect, insurance, and prep.  They confirmed two days prior and the crew called me when they headed out our way the morning of our move.  We asked for their biggest truck to see if we could get things handled in one trip and they were great in accommodating us.  The crew we had-- Chance, Ernesto, and Adam-- were professional.  We've relocated a good number of times for work, so we had things packed and organized.  The Camelback crew were beasts in getting the entire house into one haul and loaded within about 4 hours.  They kept accurate track of their time and breaks.  In all, a 2700 sq ft move to a neighboring town took 7.5 hours.  Worth every penny and I gave a great tip.  They worked hard, put down protective materials, were careful with our stuff, put boxes where they were supposed to go in the new house, and didn't harm a single wall or door.  Chance kept track of screws/bolts and reassembled our furniture, which was an impressive touch.   They even helped unload the small stuff out of our cars after seeing it and asking if we'd like a hand.  I'm a critical person.  Still, I can't come up with a single thing they could have improve on in our move.  I recommend them enthusiastically.  Update: I forgot to mention the plastic wrap they use.  It's like prophylaxis for your furniture.  Keeps things together, clean, and prevents scratching.  Great concept and they use it liberally.

Fresh and smoooooth  Love me some good smoothie on occasion. Especially after a race, or that once every couple years when you get sick and nothing else can stay down.   Robek's has a fun young staff and has kept with fresh-tasting ingredients. They also seem to know how to emulsify things well enough not to get stuck in your straw. Cost is a tad higher. Still, it's good stuff, they are pretty fast, and the service is above par, so it's worth it. They also have a card-based rewards program.   I've started visiting this spot quite a bit after stopping my juice habit for a while. Jamba and Tropical Smoothie just stopped hitting the spot in terms of taste.

Enjoyable food and experience  Might have skipped this restaurant had a friend not really wanted to try it.  Glad he did.  Probably the freshest sushi I've had in Phoenix so far.  I'm a sushi snob and loathe anything even remotely stale.  This place had its game going with good ingredients, tight sushi rolling skills, and even some subtle flavors.  Not in the same league as Japan, Taiwan, Hawai'i, or Portland, but superior for the desert.  Service was good.  Somewhat long waits and drinks go empty for a tad, but not egregious.  Plates came out with good timing and together. Check also came quickly.  Gal who served us was nice and got the order right.  Am a fan of the Westgate are and this spot has a good thing going.  Average value.    Hope they can tighten their ship and earn good Yelp reviews on a consistent basis.

Average sushi, poor fusion, inattentive service  Tried Nakama as it's close by and looked like a fun Asian-fusion place. We had some sushi, the curry dish, a Thai platter, and fried rice (for our daughter).  The dishes were sweet and were missing traditional Asian flavors and spices.  And by sweet, I mean disturbingly so.  Like the kind of sweet that makes you grimace.  The service gal was nice, but very slow. And she and another service gal were confused who had our table multiple times.    The sushi was good enough for Arizona-- tasty, well-presented, and tasted fresh.  The fried rice was also par for the course.  We waited a good amount of time between refills on drinks, check-in on food quality, and finally the check.  On the latter, we sat for about 15 minutes until someone came by we could flag down to ask for the honor of paying.  Again, they are nice, but inattentive.

The "Creeky" dishes threw us a bit, but it's a place with good food, fast and considerate service, and very good value.  Their Hot and Sour Soup is the best we've found in the Valley and the dumplings are meaty.  One knock is that the food is not spicy for "Beijing" fare.  Bottom line: The value and speed makes this a great place for work lunches.  The good food is perfect for when you are just in the mood for comfort food and don't want to cook.  And the staff is very kind to little kids.  The owner couple kind of dote on our toddler daughter.

Good, quick BBQ  Even though it's something of a BBQ fast food place, I like Shane's. The half-slab is a lot of food and two of their sauces are yummers. The meat doesn't have as much smoke favor, but is tasty and not fatty like some places.   One cool aspect of Shane's is they have a number of options that appeal to our kiddos. They usually go for the breaded chicken tenders, but can also go for a simple cheeseburger or the Mac n' Cheese. Their pulled pork sandwich gets pretty good comments, as well. And my wife loves sweet tea, so it works that they have that.  You can come across a person at the register who will not wow you. On balance though, service staff are usually cool. I've also seen Shane's at a community fund raiser event, so happy to support a business that tries to give back to the community. No all do.  Definitely worth a visit...

Excellent Food + Good Service + Nice Digs  Being a fan of Pho, always up for a friendly first visit for fresh broth, noodles, and sides.  (Okay, used up all my words beginning with the "ffff" sound.)  Pho Van is a nice restaurant with excellent Pho.  We ordered the Fried Tofu (okay), Pho Da Biet (great), Bun Ga Xao Xa (very good), and some straight noodles with chicken off the kids menu for the kids.  All were tasty and arrived with a modest wait.  Only knocks would be on service and availability.  They were training a new dude, so we had to repeat orders and things came out at different times, so our family couldn't eat quite together.  Won't rate them down too much for that.  But, then they were out of the flavored drinks we wanted to order from the menu.  Three of them.  In a row.  We ended up going simple with water and tea.  And yes, only the Boss can enter the Yelp! discount.  Very cool aquarium.  Kids were enthralled!

Usually am a proponent of diversity, but best dang white pizza ever...  I'm usually a Chicago-style deep dish pizza lover by habit.  Went to Grimaldi's on the recommendation of a co-worker with some people on my team.  Service was quick and accurate, drinks were delivered promptly and kept full, and the pizza landed in about ten minutes.  I ordered a lunch special-- the White Pizza with tomatoes and a special order of sausage.  UBER YUM!  There's no tomato sauce on this disc of flavor as it's a mix of two white cheeses, but it rocks.  Plus, the lunch special with salad and drink comes in at under $10, plus tip.  Went back with my wife this past weekend and she loved it to.  For three people, bill came to about $40, counting tip.  Not as great a deal, but still worth the trip.    So, great deal and service, clean restaurant with nice a nice design, spectacular food, and killer lunch pricing.  Have just found a new fave.

Impressive every time  Have been back a few times since my last review.  Visited yesterday and all is still excellent.  Pizzas remain incredibly yummy, service is fast and kind, and it's an excellent choice when you have kids.  The dough they give younglings to play with keeps them occupied and is a winner of an idea.  We had one boo-boo where the server mixed up my little girl's order.  The manager immediately came out, apologized, and said it was on them.  An occasional error happens and I told him that was nice to offer, but not necessary.    TIP: We ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake to share for dessert-- makes you want to say Hallelujah after each bite.    The bill came and both my daughter's meal and the dessert were credited back.  I made it up on the tip side, but it was a forthright gesture that the place wants to nail the dining experience every time.  NICE!

Great food and setting.  My wife, 3-year-old, and I hit Christopher's with a coupon from Bing.  It was listed under French cuisine, but that's not fully accurate.  There are certainly French influences, but it's not the main theme.    Beyond that, we received knowledgeable service and the staff was family-friendly.  Food was very good-- flavorful, meat was cooked correctly to the order, and pastas were rich.  They seem to put work into some interesting flavor blends if you take the time to pick up flavors and aromas.  Desserts were a hit with my ladies.  Did notice that there was another tale on the other side of the room that seemed to be having problems with their service.  A waiter seemed to be ignoring a couple for some reason.  And we were left a few times waiting for refills and our check.  But, I don't hesitate to catch someone when I'm done waiting.  All-in-all a fine experience.  We plan on visiting, again.

Exceptional food and service.  Took my in-laws to Christopher's to celebrate a retirement and had an even better experience the second visit.  The food was perfectly prepared, top quality, and tasted superb.   Josh was our server and managed our experience perfectly-- courses landed together, drinks never emptied, he was great with our 4 year-old, and was intimately knowledgeable about the preparation of the options.  Couldn't ask for a better dinner.  Only odd thing is that this restaurant is in a high-end strip mall and splits with a small bar.  Not bad things, necessarily.  Just not things one sees often.  Then again... ZinBurger is also in that mall.

A great chain restaurant option  Simple dining proposition with no surprises: Good pastries, soup and sandwich combo, reasonable pricing, free wifi, and quick-casual service that is consistent.  Staff is friendly and they keep the place clean.  Very much like a Panera.  The cinnamon rolls are very soft and uber yum.  Have some good soups, too.  Kids menu and selection of sweet-sweet carbs works for the younglings.

AAAtrocious  So, I started out attempting to access my account online. Typed my info in and the screen said my email is already registered.  Clicked the handy "Forgot my password" link and it tells me my email address is not on file. Try again to be sure and same loop.  I call the 1-800 number and the lady asks why I called the Colorado office.  Share that I didn't and that their call system forwarded me along as AAA chose; probably because I still use my cell number from Colorado.  She says she will forward me to someone who can help with my password (in a rude tone).  I get an AAA travel agent (?!) who, predictably, tells me he can't help but that he will forward me to the web team.  I was forwarded to an IVR menu that asked if I want option 1 to make travel plans or 2 for other requests.  I press 2 and get a, "Good bye".    So, I call the other number on my card with my irritation level rising.  I share that I've been forwarded twice, hung up on once, and she's my fourth point of contact.  She says she can't help me since she's in Colorado.  But, she offers to hang on after I am forwarded to ensure I get someone.  I get another lady who says she can't help me and that I need to call... wait for it... the 1-800 number.  So, I share that I am now interested in canceling my membership.  Oddly, she was very quick and able with that.  So, I am now an ex-AAA member.  These people really need to get their interstate processes, call-forwarding, and IVR systems straight.  This is a customer experience for the Horrendous Customer Service Companies book.  Maybe they will offer a AAA discount on it.

Problems resolved and I received a sincere apology  I received a call from Ashley, their Supervisor for Member Relations.  First, she made no excuses, apologized, and said the cross-state experience is something they are working to fix.  Second, she offered to correct everything along with providing a discount to earn my wife and I back as customers.  Ashley's kindness won me over.  Within a half hour, Ashley had cleared my account and Tiffany from AAA's Web Team contacted me to fix the online log-on problems.  I am now able to access my account online.  Very good comeback...

Gracious gastronomic greatness  Had Cafe Monarch on our foodie bucket list since the flattering piece about it in Phoenix Magazine.  Originally wanted to partake last summer, before finding out that it is closed during hell season in the Valley.  My wife and I visited for Valentine's Day, instead.  The converted house is beautifully done.  Service staff isn't what you'll find at a five-star/diamond place in terms of polish, but they are none the less attentive and thorough.  Some tips: Do not forget that CM is cash only; make a reservation; is price ($45) per person; and is BYOD.  There were a number of couples disappointed to step up and find out the place is already booked until March.  Another was surprised there is no ATM.  Minor things if you remember and prepare.  Food was simply perfect.  The soup was delicate and you could play with the flavors in your mouth rather than be overwhelmed by salt or sugar or vinegar or even the stock.  The steak was immaculate in flavor and texture (he even cut against the grain).  And the dessert was an elating triple chocolate confection that mixed soft, crunchy, and smooth ganache flavors in a way I had not previously experienced.    Serving sizes are what they should be.  Nothing like the over-sized, moderate-quality options at even chain nicer chains.  The setup is each table belongs to you for the whole night and there's no rush to flip tables for volume.  Last, the chef gives the impression of a kinder Gordon Ramsey-- just as serious and meticulous, is direct with his wait crew about attentiveness, but is also kind with his efforts.  It was nice that he called ahead to incorporate our food preferences.  Was more impressive that he remembered my wife's name when we checked out.   Cafe Monarch helped make our Valentine's a superb night.  The dishes are wonderfully memorable.  We'll be back for brunch, dinners, and new food experiences.

Fun, Tasty, and Good for a Special Occasion...  Our family caught dinner here to celebrate my father-in-law's promotion.  Very nice crew and the teppanyaki was fun.  Our cook didn't have the skill level you see in Japan, Taiwan, or Hawai'i, but he was still good.  The place is clean and open.  Wait staff was very nice to our little girl.  Food was very tasty and stylishly presented.  The sushi actually tasted fresh!  Combined, the price seemed worth experience... and higher bill.

Superb food, service, and decor  I'm a fan of TFK.  Everyone in our family likes the food. It's a very nice setting for a meal and deserves some interior design awards. And I feel a tad better about myself after eating there-- as if the healthy menu someone cleanses me more than 30 Hail Marys and Our Fathers.  Our girls usually are stoked to have the Watermelon Lemonade with Almond Butter, Strawberry & Banana Sandwich.  I love the Kale Salad with chicken added.  And my wife tends to go for pretty much anything on the Pizza or Entr√©es menu that doesn't have mushrooms associated with it.  Service was the usual attentive standard we're used to.  The girl even had some hiragana tattooed behind her ear, allowing me to inconspicuously refresh my reading skills.  We'll be back, again.  I still need to try their juice bar options.

Visited this place with co-workers and ended up going three times in a week.  It's uber-yum, comfort food type of fare.  I'm not knowledgeable about Cajun food, but one person I know from Louisiana who has been to this place said it's, "Really, really good.  You have to try her Mufasala!"  And yes, I'm translating that last word.  All I recall is that is sounded like the name of Simba's father.    I have had the chicken and sausage gumbo, the shrimp etoffee (sp?), and the crab landry.  All were worth the visit.  Nice crew serving.  Fast and conversational.  It's cafeteria style after you order and have your food, though.  Self-serve drinks and table busing.  Pretty sure that if you visit, this place will be one of your regular spots, too.

Good food, Great Service, Amazing View and Ambiance  Visited for our annual family Christmas Eve Dinner.  The service crew quickly impressed with their speed and attentiveness.  Upon taking our seats, we were treated to a breathtaking panoramic view of Phoenix as the sun set.  If you want to shoot for that experience, take a 5:00 PM reservation in late-December.  The designers of the restaurant did a wonderful job.  It lends intimacy to the experience.    Dining options were worthy of the occasion-- breaded shrimp "cocktail", French Onion soup, wedge salads, steaks, fish, fresh rolls, and lava cake or red velvet cake dessert plates depending on the choices.  Not a single complaint (though I couldn't finish the red velvet cake due to eating so much and its richness).  Take a moment to get some pictures of your group on the balcony and to commiserate by the fire on a cool Arizona Winter's night.  Afterward, if you have kids, go downstairs for Christmas story time with Cavalier Spaniels, to take a picture with Mrs. Claus, and then listen to the professional carolers.    Self-parking is a breeze and the Phoenician's staff seems to always be exceptionally helpful and kind.

AKA-- Yummy Salty Chang's  Not a place for authentic Chinese food, but they don't purport it and the food is tasty.  Made the unfortunate mistake of looking up the nutritional info from the menu and dear Salt Gods is this place is good for some mighty dessication!  Many of the platters are a step away from just reading "salt lick with rice and brown sauce".  That said, salt is indeed tasty.  Their dessert sampler is one of the best options out there for variety and serving sizes, sharing, and giving your youngling their own.  I do miss the banana lumpia option, though.  Service is usually good.  Generally keep the place dark for some reason.  Children's menu is okay.  They do keep the place very clean.  They have become rather pricey, which is the only consistent knock I have on the chain.

Really have enjoyed the food and the service was pretty good.  Some of the best asian food we have found in the Avondale/Goodyear area.  Their spicy soup is actually hot! (Yay!)  Of special note is their Duck Soup and their Thai Fried Rice.  Curry is good, but not remarkable.  Broths in the noodles are rich and flavorful.  This review is for our third and most recent trip.  I need to note that it seems they are starting to skimp some on the ingredients.  While still yummy, there was not much duck or noddles in the Duck Soup this past time.  Hopefully, they keep their quality up and we can keep visiting them.  It's a small, family-owned, and family-run place, which we like supporting.

Unremarkable  Was excited after seeing an ad for this event in Phoenix Magazine. Wish we would have found something else to go to given all the options this Super Bowl weekend.  We could only find four true chocolate vendors. The bulk are really just normal carnie food purveyors.  Trees were nice and lit, but the area is run down, the grounds were somewhat dirty, and there were ample opportunities to hear short-tempered people arguing who was really rude by walking past/blocking/not letting the other go.   Out of all the vendors here, we only liked the rootbeer float guy, the cheese curds/mini donuts ladies, the the only premium chocolates booth (Xocolati?), and the Hawaiian food people.  Parking wasn't too bad at least. We found a good number of spaces open towards 60, behind the businesses. $5 and only two blocks away. That's IF you do want to go to this event.

Good Asian fusion... in the West Valley!  Usually am ambivalent towards Asian fusion because so many restaurants translate that "throw whatever in and add a Szechuan or Cantonese sauce".  Visited Eest on the recommendation of some coworkers and was impressed.  Hot and sour soup is very good  Mongolian chicken is yummers and is served is a non-Asian salad, eggroll, and rice.  Meat was a tad tough, yet moist and flavorful. Eest wings are okay-- tender with a simple sweet hoisin sauce for flavor  Service is only okay.  Nice people and generally attentive.  However, it took a while for the check, they will not upgrade your side soup to Hot and Sour and require you to order a big bowl separately, and the appetizer actually came after the meal.  Along with New Wok, this is one of the two best Asian restaurants in the Valley.

Apple products with slow service   Stopped in to buy an iPad for Christmas. All the Apple goodies you expect and a nice place, but staff is slow.   I watched the kids working here play around for about ten minutes before requesting assistance from the greeter. He said they are swamped.  Responded that I can see them and they don't look busy.  He just smiled...   Ah, well. I think the gift will still go over well.

Okay option; Be ready to spend about four hours  We've used Portrait Innovations twice.  The pictures are good enough for routine family photos as your kids grow so fast.  And with the coupons available online, it's priced fairly reasonably.  Pros: Despite your concerns with the look of the staff, you get some good photos; Bathrooms and dressing rooms are good; The ability to view, select, and have your photos printed inside an hour is helpful  Cons: They are never on time with an appointment (when you have a baby, this is a BAD thing); We've spent more than four hours from arrival to walking out with pictures both times; There is up-sell; Staff can seem disorganized and abrupt

Quick, good meal options, and nice snack selection  F&E is a few blocks away from my work.  It's a reliable, clean store for quick food options.  Vegetable selection is minimal, but they have a super array of pre-made meal options.  Snack aisle is also superior-- mochi ice cream, UK chocolate, some high-end desserts, and a mix of rare beverage options.  Checkout is fast self-service and the couple staff members are very nice.

Super slow service and okay food  Was nearby for work and we were in the mood for some pho and bun. Something of  a trend, lately...  Entering Viet Kitchen, it's a nice little restaurant new Jimmy John's. We were in a hurry and had to wave at the waitresses and bar to sit. After sitting ready to order for almost ten minutes, I again had to waive at a waitress to get service. Shared that we were in a hurry and she said okay.   Pho was okay. Broth wasn't rich, hot, or tasty; more the bland standard you expect from Asian Fusion places. Noodles were a tad chewy. Good enough to eat but not something you savor. My guest said the bun wasn't super flavorful, either. Ho-hum. And the eggrolls were much more cheap cabbage/lettuce than meat. At least the prices were reasonable.  With some attention to detail, small upgrades to the food, and a step up on the service, this place could be stellar. Alas...

Very impressive store, staff, and products  Like most human beings I know, we have a mix of Apple, Google, and Windows products in our home.  And while I'm a fan of the design of Apple products, I guess I'm in the minority of folks who think the service in their stores is just average.  I've been to the Microsoft store a few times and find the design is on-par with Apple.  This was the first time I was looking to buy.  Where the MS Store stood out: (1) Service reps eager to help when you need them; (2) service reps who introduce themselves and then let you know they're there to assist if you need without pestering; and (3) an improving set of hardware options.    It is hard not to compare since we've been pitting Microsoft and Apple against each other for so long.  From what I see, the design advantages Apple has over Windows products are diminishing.  Hardware from Asus and HP is clean and elegant... just a touch away from what Apple offers but with more variety.  Office is still the best productivity suite available, though also the most expensive.  If Microsoft gets a user-friendly and more secure Win8 done, the OS battle will bend hard MS's way.  And if they can leverage the XBOX platform with a better apps ecosystem, it will be a very fun media battle for us consumers.    Bottom line: I walked out with a Surface Pro 3 bundle under my arm to test at work.  Price was about equal between Apple and Windows bundles for equal hardware and software.  And I was happier than the last time I visited the Apple Store (by a lot).

Visited with family for Christmas Eve Dinner.  Food is very good, though note that entr√©es are served with nominal pairings and you have to order family style sides.  Noise level was a little high, but nothing unbearable.  Food quality was excellent and all the selected meats and fish were cooked to perfection.  My sister and her fianc√© thoroughly enjoyed the wine selections.  The American Wagyu was exceptional-- with that level of marbling, don't hesitate to opt for it cooked medium, if that's your preference.  The fries cooked with truffle oil was recommended and it was tasty, but not exceptional..  Wait staff was very good.  However, there were some long periods where we went low on bread and drinks.    Overall: Great food; Not a great value; Good waitstaff experience; Nice decor; Would eat at again on special occasions.

Nummy num num  One of the best Korean restaurants in the Valley.  In a somewhat seedy area, but you're in for a treat once you make it past the tattoo parlor and the rough looking guy staring folks down outside.  They serve kimchee sides with meals as you find in real Korean eateries-- all very good.  Kalbi and bulgogi dishes are tasty and flavorful.  Service is very pleasant, as well.    Cafe GH reminds of the small Korean restaurants in Chicago and LA.  May just want to keep an eye on your car while you eat.  Tip: You can hit Seoul Market across the intersection to stock up after eating.  Good prices on basics.  Best kimchee selection we've found in Phoenix.

Superb area for a day of shopping, a movie, and noshing  I'm an admitted fan of Scottsdale Quarter due to the cool blend of businesses they have. My wife and I occasionally make it a special when our girls are in school and we happen to have to vacation time we need to burn.  The iPic is on the east part of the campus that stretches across N Scottsdale Rd. On the west end is the Westin Kierland. In between are tons of shops, excellent dining, ice cream, common areas with water features, and even music lounges. Heck, for Christmas, there is even a horse and carriage decked out for the holidays like in New York!  You'll enjoy the experience. People even live there as part of the mixed-use, neo-urbanism neighborhood. design. That gives a cool 24-hour vibe.  Only knocks:  1) It is less fun during the summer heat as the SQ is an outdoor mall; 2) There are some snooty people around that are really impressed with themselves, their ungodly expensive cars, and their rich attire with jewelry (you catch some complaints that a truly first-world problems-- e.g., "the spa wasn't relaxing and should have paid me to go this morning" and "Lulu did a poor yoga class this morning and they need to hire people at [some place I don't know]"; and 3) The Apple store there is still the worst one for service in Phoenix-metro. I think the snootiness rubbed off on them.  Taken as a whole, still an exceptional entertainment-eat-relax spot. The experience is one of the best in the region.

Excellent food and service with memorable menu twists  Took my wife and kids to CD for pre-Mother's Day.  It proved to be a great choice.  The soft pretzel balls and cheese fondue was a fun, new dish to start things off.  Next was a mix of cheeses, meats, and olives chosen on a sushi-style card.  Entrees of Korean-style steak, garden salad, and grilled cheese sandwich with bacon made everyone happy.  And the monkey break dessert left us cooing before we waddled out the door.    Service was excellent from Caitlin.  The rest of the service crew reminded me of the cast of Beverly Hills 90210... without the token minority.  And as the father of two little girls, the tight pants one of the service gals was wearing made we want to buy a remote island to shelter them.  Still, the experience was superb.  The pretzel balls with fondue and the Korean-stlye steak were especially memorable.  (My wonderful wife ate a third after I shared some.  Yes, I was sad.  But, I'm a giver.)  Highly recommended and we will be back...

Primo cupcake sugar coma... Yay!  Always a hit to stop by Sweet Daddy.  They have a good number of original flavors and the frosting is perfect, if a little too plentiful for my wife and I.  Our six year old, however, thinks the amount of frosting is "just right".  Service is excellent, though they look like fit Abercrombie models.  My wife noted they obviously do not eat the inventory.  If they weren't so nice, you would be tempted to throw a cupcake at them.  The Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, Doodahh (sp?), Oreo, Pumpkin Spice, and Carrot Cake are the go-to flavors in our family.

Craveworthy Burgers and THE BEST Fries  I've eaten at Smashburger since they started the chain and opened in South Denver. Menu has changed some over the years, but I was super stoked when they moved into Avondale's Foodie Corner at 99th and McDowell.  Service is relatively quick and the people are only par for the course the times I've been into the restaurant. But the food... Oh, my carnivorous happy hoots...   Burgers are super tasty. Not huge, but the flavor, soft bun, and moistness are superb. The salads (yup, they have salads!) are also great to eat, though you can tell they aren't health food by the salt and oil in the flavor mix. Probably the best two things on the menu though are the Smashfries and the shakes. The fries are frite-style, crispy, and have the most wonderful blend of salt, olive oil, garlic and rosemary flavors. The shakes come in many options-- all have the taste of heavy butterfat, and are perfectly thick.   Definitely worth a visit, or eight. :o)

Nice little French place in the Lake Las Vegas Village.  Dropped in for dinner while staying at Ravella.  It's a small, cute restaurant with nice stall and tasty food.  They were very good our daughters, checked in regularly with us to ensure were were enjoying our meal, and the execution on our dishes was great.  The French Onion Soup is sweeter than what else I've experienced, but they make it work.  The Tartine I had and fish dish my wife had were both very enjoyable.

NY style pie on the in the West Valley  More of a Chicago-style pizza family, but we like NYPD Pizza.  Setting is an open, loud restaurant.  Ordering is quick, drinks arrive quickly, and the service is upbeat.  Pizza is actually very good-- too often, NY-style places are super oily and lack interesting flavor.  These folks don't commit those sins and you can taste your toppings.  Very good for groups.  Price is a tad high for pizza compared to the big chains.  All prices are going up these day though, and this is much better than a Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Pappa John's.

VERY mixed experience plus poor service   After seeing some great reviews for this Salon on Yelp!, I bought my wife a gift certificate from Salon De Cheveux for her birthday. Her first visit was good and she came back happy, minus some confusion on the part of De Cheveux staff how to use her gift credit.  More recently, my wife has been very upset on her last two visits. Both were cases where the stylists did very little and did not listen to what my wife said she wanted. Then, they refused to take her gift credit. I stepped up to discuss it the first time-- helping to clarify that we expected the Salon would honor their store credit. We thought their crew had a bad day and left a bit perturbed after things were fixed, but not thinking more of it.  On her third visit, my wife said it happened again.  She said she just insisted until it got resolved. However, between the poor work of the stylist (it didn't look one bit different from when she left at hour prior) and the horrible service with her birthday gift certificate, she was clear that she will be going elsewhere in the future.   I'm especially unimpressed. Way to make my birthday gift to my wife translate into frustration and dissatisfaction with her hairstyle. I bought the credit for them to make her feel more beautiful. They could only manage to make it an offensive experience. Twice.

Red Robin... Yummmmmmm  The Gourmet Burgers are the best chain burger option out there.  These things will kill your waistline, stretch your colon, cause minor heart calcification, and are relatively expensive.  And they are worth it!  Add the tower of onion rings and I think the paper in the basket is a template Last Will and Testament form.  Very family friendly with kid options galore, a diner feel, small arcade, and even free balloons.  Service can be hit or miss with younger wait staff.  Oddly, I've had three waiters-in-training with their mentors in five vists.  Good overall, though.  Carry on my burger brethren...

They are called Sr's Barber Shop, now.  Have visited this shop three times.  Usually two to three barbers and the two ladies have taken care of me on my visits.  Both do a good job to your direction.    Nice little place, usually get a chair right away, quality cut, and prices are very fair.  Can't beat that!

Amazing patios and service... Meh food  Visited for the holiday and was stoked about eating at El Chorro. After hearing of its long history, quality food, and sticky buns, my expectations were very high.   First, the restaurant has an amazing design-- tons of patio spaces with fireplaces, a semi-private grass yard, old-style rooms with all modern amenities, and all while preserving the historic nature and charm. The western theme prevails through the renovated touches.   Second, the service was top-notch at every turn. We arrived early and they were able to seat us nonetheless. Vicki quickly visited us, took orders, and started to check on us frequently and with an earnest joy. Supporting cast and the waiter from the next table were just as gracious.  Ah, but the food... Our party covered the menu: Lobster Bisque, Arugula Salad, Shrimp Cocktail, Scottish Salmon, Beef Tenderloin, Organic Turkey, Peach Cobbler, and Cheesecake. To the person, all said things were flat on taste. Aside from the sticky buns, nothing stood out. The Bisque was bitter from the sherry used. Salad was par. Shrimp cocktail were well-sized, but standard fare and sauce. The salmon had quality and a great cook's touch on its side, yet left two in our party perplexed by the off pairing with a corn succotash. Two others thought the tenderloin was a great cut undermined by being too raw and being paired with a forgettable gratin potato and completely bland creamed spinach that tasted little like their ingredients. Last, the cheesecake and cobbler were so dull that not a single person of six finished their dessert. And our family craves desserts like Frosty the Snowman likes magic hats!  I'd love to score El Chorro higher. All the pieces are there, except the food. And since it's a restaurant, that's too important to disregard.

Shrinking portions + So-So Baked Goods + Friendly Service  Stopped by for lunch at this Paradise Bakery as it was the choice of our daughter on her birthday. Very friendly staff, but I was surprised how every little thing seemed to have a special charge. Heart cookie instead of chocolate chip? Extra $2. Cheese on ham sandwich? Add $0.50. Croissant bread instead of sourdough? $0.75 additional, yo! Even the staff complained about the menu changes last year and having to nickle and dime customers.  On top of everything, the baked goods aren't as tasty we recalled. My wife complained about the severe lemon flavor in the heart cookie. Chocolate chip cookies we so average that none of us finished ours. And we NEVER leave cookies unfinished!  At least the food was good. Small servings mind you, but maybe they are hinting that we Americans eat too much and need to adjust our portion sizes down. Fair enough if that's their aim.

Doesn't get any better  Dennis and his team do a superb job.  Prices are upfront.  Dennis and his assistant are quick and easy to work with.  Quality of the work is worlds above the alter-by-numbers people at most dry cleaners and at around malls.  My suit alterations all fit perfectly.  Only drawback are the occasional customers who drive up in their luxury cars, try to cut in line, tell the staff to give them better prices, and then generally huff around the place.  Wish there were more gracious people in the world.  Credit to Dennis and crew for having the patience to tolerate people like that.  Dennis said they will be moving this summer, so will need to keep an eye on where they land.

Crepes and general French yumminess  Went to Le Chalet for lunch, today.  Cute little place that opens at 11 AM.  The sandwich, crepe, and salads are superb.  Kid's mean had a ham and cheese option with sweet potato fries that our little girl thoroughly enjoyed.  Service is quick and kind.  Drinks and food arrive promptly and the waiter was happy to share about each dish.  He prepped us that the cuisine is northern French and meal crepes are made with a buckwheat flour while dessert crepes are made with the sweet white flour and egg mixture I'm accustomed to.  Serving sizes are just right and cost for three people was about $40 including a dessert banana and chocolate crepe my wife, daughter, and I (unwillingly) shared.  The setting was cute-- kind of a French-Swiss ski chalet feel.  Not a common thing in a desert of hellish summer heat.

Good gym, bad experience with their childcare  Facilities are nice and access to equipment isn't a fight.  They do a good job of keeping things clean, as well.  You can't stop gym-goers who don't clean up after themselves, so can't blame them for that.  For classes, they can be hard to schedule with.  We've had the experience where "someone lost the paperwork" twice.  We also had a bit of an issue where a discount given by the gym was reversed by billing and we had to resolve it.    Regarding the childcare services, it's scary.  I left my daughter there once and came back to find her bawling in a corner with other kids throwing toys at each other.  The distracted teenage girls "watching" things were blabbing about their life drama without paying attention.  I asked them to handle the violent kids and they did, with apparently requisite eye-rolls characteristic of drama queens.  Another gym-goer (a police officer) and his wife told me later that the gym childcare centers are unregulated by Arizona law.  They found their kid wandering the hall once and no one could answer why or how.  So, they don't take their kids their anymore.  My wife and I followed their lead.  Really torn on the place with so many pros and cons, but it's close and ha lots of options...

Fun little ice cream shop!  We were in the mood for some ice cream in the West Valley and Yelp'd for the best option. Made our way to Scooptacular and ended up having a fun ice cream run. Was even impressed that the prices aren't killer.  The shop is kid-friendly and they have a mix of custom flavors that turn you indecisive.  You almost want a triple scoop to avoid missing a delicious flavor that will haunt you later. And the review that said the waffle cones are perfect for eating with the ice cream nailed it.  Definitely worth repeat visits and it appears there are families that make this shop a routine tradition. The staff is very friendly and knew other visitors, some by name. And from the items on the walls, the shop owners try hard to be good corporate citizens and give back to the community.  Tip: They do have a loyalty card!

Best preschool and daycare center in the West Valley  My wife and I looked at every daycare/preschool in the Avondale/Tolleson/Goodyear/Buckeye/Litchfield Park area when we moved here.  Primrose School stood out as the best option by far.  We are fans of Piaget-based learning and development programs.  The time and stage of development is important, so it's valuable if you can find a school that fulfills the character, educational, social, and physical needs of your kid.  The Velardi family and the staff they have put together teach to those goals and earnestly care for our daughter and her friends.    Over the past 18 months, we have seen very little turnover and both teachers and school staff communicate exceptionally well with parent.  Special events like the holiday show and parents night out are a nice touch.  And we are very pleased with how our little girl is developing.  We've made some long-term friends.  Couldn't recommend a preschool any more than I do Primrose at Palm Valley.

Solid Indian buffet option  Nice restaurant option next to Sprouts in Avondale.  Place is clean, food is good, and you can wrap up a lunch in less than an hour.  I'm a fan of naan, and theirs is straightforward tasty.  Service staff are par for the course-- good at getting you started, so-so on keeping drinks filled, and take care of the check quickly.  Minimal personal interaction, but that's cool if you're looking to enjoy the company of your companions.  The little TV was something of a distraction.  Would rank it a star up if they had more meat options in the buffet.  Most of it is vegetable oriented.  Nominal dessert options, as well.

One of the best fastfood options around  This Chick-fil-A has friendly staff and are quick with their service.  Food is good and sit better than the other fastfood places around.    I really like their chicken soup when I'm battling a cold-- the warmth, perfect mix of noodle and chicken, and saltiness hit the spot.

Yum + Fast Delivery  Made a delivery order from Sal's today to give the local shop a try.  Order taker was nice enough and got the order right.  Food arrived about 25 minutes later.  Faster that frozen!  The Margarita pizza was good.  Honestly better tasting than looking.  My 5 year-old commented how much she liked it and she's not normally a pizza girl.  They were nice to do a half-order of butter noodles for my daughter, as well.    Wings were excellent-- tender and moist meat with a tasty sauce.  Not really spicy, but nonetheless yummy.    Very good option for us West Siders!

Uber-yum and fun designs  Took advantage of a coupon for Cupcakes by Design for our daughter's 5th birthday.  They did a wonderful job with the "High Tea" theme, even fashioning a confection tea set as a topper.  The cake was a hit with the little ladies at my daughter's party, as well as the parents.  My wife also bought some cupcakes while there. We probably partake of sweet baked goods WAY too often, but we especially enjoyed their treats.  Cake was soft and moist. Icing wasn't overboard.  And they successfully balanced things without being so intensely sugary sweet that you fall into a diabetic coma shortly after ingestion.  The selection has cute design touches, too.  I'm surprised their rating isn't higher.  Regardless, we'll be back.

Okay in a pinch.  My wife and I stopped in here before catching a movie.  It's a fast-food quasi-Japanese place.  On the positive, the food seemed fresh, food came quickly, and things are kept tidy.  The negatives: The staff was Silent Bob-ish, the smell of bleach overpowered the food to a degree, and their teriyaki is more sugary that it should be.  I could barely taste anything else.  They committed sushi sin in that the rice was stale/dry.  The price was high for this kind of food, as well.

An actual good plumber...  In the process of moving, SW Gas said they couldn't turn on the water heater in our new place due to a bad install and potential CO leak.  Calling plumbers, we came across a bunch that made you feel as if you should be grateful to do business with them... on their lazy schedule... and with the privilege of paying them just to visit the West Valley.  And boy, could they sell you a bnch of other things you "need".  Finally Yelp'd it and we found Freddy's Plumbing.  George came out in the morning, fixed the issues in a few hours, and cleaned up haphazard venting/piping into the ceiling while he was at it.  Things look textbook, now.    We were able to move in and have hot water.  Price was in the range of the original estimate and was very reasonable.  Couldn't ask for anything more...

CuPIEcakes? Yes!  Was in the neighborhood for a meeting and saw that one of my bookmarked spots was close by-- 21 Cakes. The shop is very nice and is across from the railroad park, on the far right side despite what your nav system might say.  I took an order of their cupcake in a jar, an assortment of their cupcakes and macaroons, and two of their cupcake pie concoctions.   First, the cupcake pie things-- I henceforth name them cuPIEcakes!-- are A-MAY-ZING! Perfect crust, just the right size, and the fruit gives a wonderful balance of sweetness. My wife and I had the apple and the cherry. Both were stellar and elicited many "ooooh"s and "aaahh"s.   The traditional cupcakes were very good to my tastes. That said, my wife has named 21 Cakes her new fave for cupcakes based on their Vanilla Salted Carmel. They unseated Happy Cakes in Denver, which I never thought could be done!  Macaroons were also yummy. However, they are expensive for what you get. My wife and little girl said they'll just make those and to take any savings to put towards more cuPIEcakes and Salted Carmel cupcakes. :o)

Enjoyable Bistro with Fine Touches  Attended a work dinner at S52, in one of the rear meeting rooms. First, the service staff was very attentive and quick about their work. Plates landed together and were accurate to the order, drinks we kept relatively "afloat", courses did not linger when done, and there was plenty of engaging banter.  Food was very good and what one would expect for this type of upper-end establishment. Truthfully, the menu is the only way I can tell the difference between S52 and Capital Grille, next door. The fish and vegetables were okay... a tad bland to my taste. The preceding salad was a enjoyable. And the desserts were especially yummers.   The setting is dark, candle-lit, with stone and wood accents. Worth the visit. It's the kind if place I imagine taking my wife to for anniversary dinners in our retirement years. :o)

Superb combo of tasty food, comfortable setting, and good for you.  We started with the shrimp dumplings (pretty good) and the chicken tortilla soup (yummy though I usually hate beans).  We weren't sure about the kids' menu items.  They sound like synonyms for "twigs" and "gravel", but the apple, banana; strawberry sandwich was a hit.    Grass Fed Bison Burger and the Fish Tacos were uber yum.  My wife isn't a fan of mushrooms, but the shiitake add flavor and texture with the parmesan flakes. I chose the kale salad as my side and found myself scarfing it down.  The fish tacos were very flavorful.  Chose the Almond Cake for dessert-- small but fresh and tasty.    Left thinking, "Yes, I scarfed kale.  Who knew it could be good?"  We'll definitely hit this place again.

Movie Nirvana  Wife took me to iPic for my birthday to take in a blockbuster. Whereas once I was lost, now I am found.    Picture this: Lounger with perfect foam padding; electronic seat positioning; soft (clean smelling) blanket; comfy pillows; big arm pads; and a waiter tending your food and drink wants.  Heck with Heaven...  Video and sound are movie-quality.  Waiter was a pro and didn't pester as I enjoyed the movie with my nicely elevated feet supported at zero gravity.  Food was good, though not great.    Bathroom is fancy enough that you doubt whether you should to tinkle.    Worth every penny and a few extra.

New Fave Place for Hawaiian Grinds!  Saw Leo's highlighted on Yelp! and thought to give it a try after another disappointment at the other places in town. Very glad I did.  My wife had the Kalua Pork, I had the BBQ Mix, our older daughter went Noodle Bowl, and we got Chicken Katsu for our toddler. All washed down with Hawaiian Sun fruit drinks, of course. And took some spam musubi and manapua to go.  Food is excellent with ample portions. Kalbi and teriyaki chicken reminded me of home. I loved the mac salad. However, my daughters thought it too oniony. lol  The staff were cool. A lady who seemed like an owner or manager connected with our toddler. Very nice people.  Alas, no kimchee on the side and no poi or haupia for dessert. That's minor, though.  It's nice to get and island feel in Phoenix as the chances aren't common. And leaving with a full tummy is even better!

Sweet!  Nice shop and staff.  They have candy for kids with animals, Hello Kitty, and superheroes.  They have chocolate from the UK and even Turkey.  80s candy? They have some.  But wait, there's more: For a limited time, buy $10 in candy and you get some free salt water taffy!  Seriously, this is a fun little shop to get a fix for those of us with a sweet tooth.

Truly superb from appetizers to entrees.  My wife took me to CPH for my birthday.  It was amazing.  Again, AMAZING.  Apps: Pork Belly was sublime with perfect meat and memorable flavors.  Tracy's chopped salad earned a smile at first bite.  Our little girl liked the mac & cheese.  Had the ribs for our dinners.  BEST.  RIBS.  EVER.  The cherry-based BBQ sauce was grin-worthy.  Greens were cooked perfectly and the mashed yams/potatoes combined perfectly.  And the bread pudding was loved by all.  The staff fit us in even though we didn't have a reservation.  I think they were kind to us since we had a baby in tow.  The front staff made faces and cooed at her.  Kat took care of us and earned her 25% tip.  Orders were fast; apps hit quickly followed shortly by entrees once the first plates were cleared; drinks never went more than half empty; and she was our 5-year old hit it off.

Great upscale option in the West Valley  Took a coworker to Litchfield's for a working dinner and to celebrate a project well done.  We had heard that Colangelo and his partners bought the Wigwam and had made some drastic improvements, including to the main dining option.  Tip: You can park inside the gate and don't have to be a guest or member.  I parked outside and had to walk... apparently, just because I felt like being foolish.  Was impressed with the food quality and flavor.  They have an appealing menu for American ranch fare.  The steaks we had were cooked perfectly and flavorful without being over-seasoned.  Sides were good and the interior design of the restaurant was quiet and comfortable.  Dessert options were standard fare.    Overall, there is nothing novel in terms of food and dishes, and what they serve is executed very well.  Service staff is par for the course.  Very nice, yet a clear step away from top tier. Attentive enough though, and you aren't left to wait too long between courses and paying for thing when ready to wrap up.

Short on the menu, great on the plate.  Hit this spot for a work lunch. Wait staff sat us quickly, then got us drinks shortly after sliding into the booth and taking orders.  Food came out together, about ten minutes after ordering.  Little on the loud side.  Food options are on a brief menu. Our group had various salads options and the tortoli (sp?).  The latter is a ravioli-type pasta, plus a heart attack. Amazingly tasty with a very rich filling.  Probably a pound of butter in the dish.  I received some good advice to order it with the chicken to balance the meal out and that was dead on.  Those in our group who had the salads spoke highly of them, as well.  Fun place and one to visit, again.

Super northern-Chinese food!  If you're a fan of spicy and heartier Chinese food, this place has you covered.  It really is excellent and I'd easily give it five stars if the service was a bit quicker, there were more drink options than soda, and there were a dessert or two to select from.  Hot and Sour Soup is some of the best in the Valley, and the folks here do authentic bun and dumpling options under the Handmade Appetizers section of the menu.  The spicy dishes are actually spicy, which rocks.  And the noodle and duck dishes we had were pretty good.  Was cool to see Chinese families eating, hanging out, and conversing with the restaraunt staff.  Reminded me of the tone and feel of places in Taiwan when growing up.  Staff is also nice...

Fun little place with good noodle bowls.  Had some family in town and we hit this restaurant together.  Food is good and the staff is friendly.  They were all young and sometimes forgot to check on drinks and finished dishes, but they did circle back and were kind.  Broth for the Pho was rich and savory.  Garnishes were good, but could have been more flavorful.  Other noodle bowls were yummy.  One odd thing was two people ordered the same dish and one had a lot more egg roll in it than the other.    The Saigon Chicken Wings were a new an cool twist on a traditional appetizer.  Pot stickers were pretty good, as well.  Good value overall.

Best Mexican food I've had  Tagged this place as an eatery to hit due to its great Yelp scores.  Just visited it and I understand why.  It deserves every star it gets.  I'm normally not a fan of Mexican food and don't know what's truly authentic.  Without exception, I find the cuisine too greasy, cheesy, and bland unless I slather on Tapatio or Cholula.  No longer.  Don Pancho's food is wonderfully flavorful, meats are tender, and it tastes fresh.  Great menu with selections you do not see at Americanized Mexican food eateries.  Service is fast and exceptionally courteous.  Chips and salsas are also good.  And their flan is uber yum.  We will be back to try more of the selections we've never heard of.  I had the beef head tacos and loved them.

Good burgers. Great concretes.  No sure why we didn't try this place sooner.  Since going the first time a couple months back, we've been there every week or two.  Burgers are good.  Fries a super yum.  Dogs are okay.  But the concretes are amazing.  It's one of our new faves for frozen treats.  Nice service staff, as well.  They get food out quickly and it actually looks similar to the advertisement pictures.  The manager even made rounds to check on folks.  Haven't seen that nice touch in a while.

Top-Notch Facility-- An Avondale Gem  The Randall McDaniel complex is a sport center owned by the City of Avondale and run by American Sports Centers. It's a great facility for basketball, volleyball, and soccer events-- big, modern, clean, and attractive.  There are also some meeting rooms to the side that I've attended events at.  Getting court time during work hours on weekdays is usually easy. Weekends are full of tournaments with masses of kids and adults, so not a good time to swing by for a pick-up game. (Except Superbowl weekend, it seems.) I've also seen regional and national events listed at ASC-- NCAA championship qualifiers, club sports championships, etc-- that last around a week.    Cool to have this kind of facility in the West Valley and a fun visit.

A Filipino bakery in Arizona? Yes!  Stopped in after shopping for groceries at the Lee Lee's in the same complex and buying drinks at the Boba Tea House down the row.  Stepped in and was surprised to find ube, pan de sal, manapua, empanadas, and even adobo.  Very tasty and reminded me of Hawai'i.  Definitely worth the visit and food fix.

Another fountain of froyo fun  Trying out all the froyo places in the West Valley.  This is another good option-- similar prices and flavors, cool decor, and a good selection of toppings.  Really like how clean they keep this place.  This spot would be hard to find if we didn't see it regularly while heading to other stores in the same strip mall.  Hope they can get some street signage going.

Bowl is bigger than I thought  Hit GG for a co-worker's birthday.  Nice staff and the place is trendy and clean.  A bit loud, but not bad.  Getting to the line and choosing your food is easy.  Easier if you have long arms as the sneeze guards make you stretch to get options in the rear.  Leave your Mongolian concoction at the cooks bar, mark which starch you want (noodles, rice, burrito?!), take your number, and go sit down.  About 10 minutes later your dish arrives.   Turns out there is more than enough food in one bowl.  Most of us were commenting how stuffed we felt about 3/4 through.  Another aspect is you make your dish, so if you mess it up with odd flavors, it's all on you.  As a Mongolian place, some of the options are weird-- burrito, pepperoni, fruit, et al.  One doesn't have to choose those options, but it's still odd to see.  On the plus, it's quick, tasty, and quality eats.  Oh, and birthday boy loved the tuxedo bomb dessert.  He was in a happy diabetic coma all the way home.

Not as enjoyable  Had not visited in a while and decided to stop by for lunch. The experience wasn't poor, but wasn't as enjoyable in the past for three reasons:  (1) The food area was messy, with beef and chicken slices smeared on the bar where you select ingredient. We navigate our trays around the meet stains. (2) We would occasionally get the smell of bile or bad beer waft our way at our first table. (3) The bathroom was bad enough that the two people ahead of me stepped in, then backed right out with sour looks on their faces. I decided I could wait rather than risk any olfactory harm.  Maybe it was just an amazing party the night before that left things in less than stellar shape. The service was actually fine and the food was okay. It was just the cleanliness issues that served as a big turn-off.   Oh, and at $15+ per person on average, the bowls should be bigger...

Yummy and fast lunch for a good price  Stopped in for some Thai for lunch.  This place is across from the Wells Fargo building and gets a good business crowd.  Very friendly young people took our order and bussed the table.  Did a good job of keeping drinks filled throughout the meal.  I also liked that they made sure I wanted real spiciness for my meal. So many restaurants are timid with the heat.  Maybe I looked non-pale enough that they believed I could handle it.    An "adult" came and served us our meal.  Excellent curry and noodle dishes.  And the spice was there as desired in my dish-- just the right level to give some heat while not totally overpowering the flavors.  Eggroll and soup were only okay, though.  My associate and I came away thinking the service, value, speed, and food were worth the visit.  We'll stop by, again.

Excellent place for lunch  The space is fun and the price is right at about $12 a person for lunch.  Service staff is cool and never leave you waiting for long.  The Arnold Palmer was perfect.  Space would not lend well to large groups of more than eight, though.    Short menu of food options.  Ordering two single tacos is just the right amount of food and are tasty, though the pork was a bit tough.  Others in our group liked the burgers and the burrito.  Fudge with chocolate sauce was a hit for our person celebrating a birthday.

Darn good cookies, tea, and people!  The Coyote Oaties folks had samples at the Food Truck Festival and my wife, girls, and I wandered into their nearby store for a drink. All the drinks we could find at the fest was just short of pure sugar water!  The store is a cool throwback: shabby-chic d√©cor with lots of knickknacks, sit down spots, and ordering in the back of the long, narrow space. We ordered two iced teas and three cookies. Talking with the store person (owner?) amidst the business, she shared how they had been cooking since 4 AM for the event and needed to call someone to help man the samples station outside. When she found that they were out of the cherry oatmeal cookies, she leaned back and asked her mom about when they would be ready, to which "2:40 seconds" was the immediately reply.  On the food, they serve large cookie "wads" and are delicious! Our little girls loved them; soft, sweet, buttery, and large. The teas are also hefty and good for the money. No weak serving sizes with Mom in back!  Seriously, these folks have something great going. I'll look forward to visiting again the next time I'm near Glendale City Hall.

Too bad it's closed...  Costa Vida had a fresh-tasting menu, good loyalty program, and was an option for your gluten-sensitive friends.  Staff was nice and remembered your preferences.  They also kept the place very clean.    Sad to see it close down.

Just about saved my life  So I got the norovirus and was having problems keeping anything down.  No jello or bullion or ginger ale would stay inside for more than a few minutes.   Dehydrated and cramping, my wife bought me a Mango Magic from Tropical Smoothie Cafe with the thought that the cold and natural juices would help.  I nursed on the smoothie for the next five hours.  It stayed down and I started to emerge from the throes of what felt like a certain painful, wasting death.  After losing about eight pounds in two days, I had two Mango Magics a day the next two days as I recovered fluids and electrolytes.  Kidding aside, the smoothies are tasty and don't have the artificial flavoring taste that other places do.  I'm grateful we found them and will stick with them for an occasional meal or snack.

Meh.  Being new to the area, we had heard great things about this chain.  When they arrived in Avondale, we tried them out.  Food was only okay.  Salsa was unremarkable and like what you'd get from a Tostitos-branded jar at the Fresh & Easy across the street.  The service was very slow, even in bringing us chips.  It was rather loud.  And the ambiance was a cross of Ikea and nouveau K-Mart cafeteria.  Cool setting, though.  I'm a fan of the Avondale Sports Complex.  Great setting for families and team sports.

Nom Nom Nom... Yummy Thai  Yellow Curry and Duck Soup were both excellent.  Serving portions were generous.  And the kids meal fried rice was okay.  Service staff was super nice and the restaurant is well appointed.  On the other side, there was food on the floor and chair, along with a used napkin on the table leg where they sat us.  Probably just a rare miss.  We'll definitely visit again because the food was so tasty.  Their curry was perfect on a chilly night.

Yay for Ice Cream Trucks!  The Mr Softee truck was at the Tale of Two Cities Parade. They had a cool area with a bunch of food trucks off to the side of the booths and college buildings. Close to everything, but out of the way enough to snack with a bit more quiet and less bustle.  Had the Rootbeer Float and an ice cream cone for our girls. Smoooooth soft serve on a warm day was a hit with the kids while the float hit the spot for my wife and I. And don't forget the sprinkles!

Nice staff and great treats  Had some sweets as a reward for our daughter deciding to have her ears pierced and being brave throughout.  She wanted some purple cake pops in the case, but they were for a wedding the following morning.  So, the staff was really nice and dressed up a purple cupcake just for her at no charge.  Very cool customer service touch.  Cupcakes are awesome, if too much for one sitting.  Suggest cutting it in half to save some for later, or sharing two people to one cupcake.  Unless you have a daughter like ours.  She'll eat a whole one with no problem.  And she loves their cake pops.    I also think there's too much icing.  My wife and little girls strongly disagree.

Just short of useless  We visited this store after the Verizon location near Dysart and I-10 was out of the phone model my wife and I were looking for. Having seen the large difference in customer service and technical ability, there is zero wondering "why?".   The store that sent us asked us to visit the manager here, who would have everything set up. It wasn't. And he was too busy wandering around the store to bother, so we were assigned to a young lady. She had no idea what we were trying to do and we had to explain it a few times-- two iPhones, Verizon email offer for upgrade and discount, came from the Dysart and I-10 store because they didn't have inventory. Not sure why that made her feel off-put, but she came across as inconvenienced.   Then, the comedy of errors... Said we wanted to move to the Edge plan to share data and for unlimited voice and messaging, along with a possible air card. She argued that we would be changing plans. Confirmed it was indeed our intent, unless Verizon would let us share the data from our grandfathered plans. Nope. Get an email on my phone that an order was put through. Said I didn't sign and that I expected to do it with the phone purchase and to review things together before the order was executed. Was told it had to be separate. Looked things over on the plan change and things seem to be fine. Onto purchasing two iPhones. She can't get the scanner to work. Hand enters the numbers and I make the comment that it's a lot of numbers to type into the system. "I have to," is the answer I get. Same thing for the second phone after she can't figure out how to scan that one, either. Look over the order and confirm, but cancel the air card order since she has taken so long and communicated so poorly. AND Neither phone cuts over on Christmas... She doesn't have it set up after all. I avoid her and this store. I visit Carlos, Josue, and the manager at the Dysart and I-10 Verizon store. They fix things.  Sweet nutcrackers, these folks just about made us look for different Christmas gifts. They were so exceptionally difficult and aloof that I started to think AT&T or T-Mobile might be better. Briefly. After 15+ years with Verizon.   In the end, I'm happy to say that the Verizon store at Dysart and I-10 turned things around for us. Will continue to avoid this location in favor of that one for as long as I live (in the area).

A boba tea for your time at the mall  Very cool to have Pinoy's at the mall.  We grab a bubble tea when we visit, before making our rounds.  Black milk tea and taro slush are our usuals.  The boba are a bit soft for my preference, but still good.  And the teas are tasty.  Small selection of Filipino and other pastries, as well.

Nom nom nom.  Cheese curds!  Used to have Culvers butter burgers and cheese curds when I was in college, in Wisconsin.  Yay to the fates for bringing them to Avondale!  Met the family that owns the place and they are super nice.  Food is higher quality and costs a little more.  It's worth it.  Burgers are super yum, desserts are a big hit with my wife and daughter, and I eat cheese curds until my lactose intolerance warns me otherwise.    Non-burger options are also good-- French Dip, chicken, and soup.  Ice cream is actually custard, so it's thicker.  May be an extra good thing to stand up to the AZ hell-summer.  My work team loves it when we bring in Concrete Mixers for them for special occasions.

Best bowling in the Valley  Went bowling with my wife and little girls on a Sunday.  Uptown was very busy and we had a 1.5 hour wait.  But, it timed well for us to hit dinner before a couple games and worked out.  Staff is very nice, but seems to struggle with the rush of people constantly hitting them. Some management structure and training would go a long way toward helping them provide a better overall customer experience-- have multiple register running instead of three people figuring out how to charge a bill; not having people run back and forth from register to shoes; check-in station instead of mixing bowling/paying and check-in flows; et al.  But, at least they try to be as pleasant as possible.  The fourth star comes from having a clean, fun, youth-friendly setting.  There truly is no better bowling experience around.  The game and laser tag areas are also cool.    Visiting Uptown makes for a family-friendly excursion.  Games, frames, and A/C on a hot weekend.  Some minor improvements an they could start averaging four to five stars.

Bubble teas and sweet sweet carbs...  The West Valley doesn't have a lot of good options for people who like nonstandard Asian fare.  Growing up in Taiwan for a while, my bubble tea intake has been limited to trips to Chandler.  No more!  And my little girl loves the donut holes with her taro boba slush once a week.  I may be giving her diabetes, but she's a happy kid.  The staff is very nice and works to accommodate.  My hope is that they will do well despite the lack of street advertising.  We customers will need to put the word out so they stay in town.  The Avondale Sports Center area would be even better as a location!  Imagine: A butter burger from Culver's + Express Donut bubble tea.   Mmmmmm...

Best froyo place in the West Valley  Trying out all the froyo places in the West side.  Yogurtini is the best place we've found so far.  Prices are on par, great selection of flavors, decor is nice, they keep it clean overall, patio seating is a good option, and they have a superior selection of toppings.  From chocolate to mango bobas to sauces, they have you covered.

Yummy cupcakes  Pixy Cakes is an Avondale institution at this point. Nice staff coupled with moist cupcakes and fun flavors. Also am a fan of their frosting-- not overly sweet and they don't put so much on that it drowns out the flavor of the cake portion.  Tip: Get a couple Pixy Cakes and walk over to JT Boba House just a few steps away for some teas. Pair them right and you have a super combo of sweetness.

So much for good service  Visited Pixy Cakes today to order a cake for our daughter, who will turn two years old. After inquiring about options, a rude, older goth-ish girl said they would not take our order and kept cutting my wife off whenever she tried to ask a question.   It took about four of these exchanges until my wife was thoroughly offended and we were done. Off we went to Yelp! another, nicer place that will make our baby girl something nice.  Not sure what happened. Such an extreme reversal of a service experience is hard to understand, especially for a small business trying to do well. Only know that we will not be back.

Your Gyro yumminess  Hit this place up and was impressed by the fast service, tasty food, portion size, and nice owner.    The gyro meat is very tender and is missing the nasty oiliness I've come to expect from other Greek restaurants.  The pita fries were new to me I polished them off.  Tip: There's an occasional coupon in the West Valley View that makes a visit a great deal.

Odd name and tasty food  Not sure if the name was an accident on the window order, but this place has the goods when it comes to tasty food.  Stopped by for a work lunch when some folks at Buckeye City Hall recommended it.  Club was excellent and the avocado and spicy sauce (horseradish?) were excellent together.  My colleagues also raved about their meals.  When so many of these cafes taste the same, it's cool to see a novel restaurant in the downtown of a small city doing cool things.  Even the cafe-made chips, which I usually detest, were good.

Good Thai food with HEAT!  So, my wife and I love us some Thai food.  Saw this location in a Phoenix Magazine article and stopped in when visiting family nearby. Was a good visit and reminds me of a small Thai restaurant from back in Hawai'i.    First, good boba teas always make a meal better. My wife and girls though the boba were cooked perfectly and the flavors were yummy.  From there, the noodle dish my wife had and the fried rice my daughters enjoyed all hit the spot. I had the Sala Thai noodle dish and asked that it be very spicy. Even though I ask, I'm used to restaurants giving me something barely mild. Not here! They truly game me a good mix of heat and flavor-- perfect for clearing out the sinuses.   The wait staff is very young and I get the sense this is a family-owned joint. The crew even appeared to have dinner together at the back table when we were wrapping up and paying. We're very cool with that family small-dining experience.

Mmmm burger + fries...  Am a fan of 5 Guys.  Simple menu, good burger, and it's cool how the fries come from potato farms from different regions of the US each week.  It's like I'm a connoisseur of fries.  You can also malt vinegar them!  Service is almost always friendly.  It can be hard to get a table and there is a line that often goes out the door if it's anywhere near lunch or dinner.  And not at all healthy.  Just uber yum.

Neat bazaar of boutiques!  This is a rocking concept, with a bunch of little shops in a larger collective space that you walk through. Very much an artists collective feel to the people and goods. Lots of smiles and unique items available, clean, and bright.  We like to stop in when around the Biltmore area. KAK is good for some pastries and they come through when we are looking for uncommon gifts for relatives and friends who have everything. Feels good to support smaller businesses at the same time.  Tons of charm and definitely worth the visit. I'd love to see this type of shopping concept spread...

Kick this life bucket list challenge...  Tough Mudder was a fun + painful endeavor.  Great team experience with coworkers and friends who are up to the challenge.    Some tips: If it's cold, invest in Under Armor compression Cold Gear and some wicking cargo pants.  Use some Wet Grips gloves with the finger tips cut off. Figure out a way to keep the sand and rocks out of your shoes-- it really makes life miserable.  Don't focus heavily on running.  The ability to hammer out five to six miles is enough since you wait at some obstacles.  Tease the people in animal outfits and running in their underwear.  Then give those people hugs.  Build up your muscles for rows and pull ups.  Be ready for ice baths.  Practice getting to a full sprint in about 20 feet for Everest.  Don't worry about the electrical shock.  Unless it's painful to you.  Then, wear a wetsuit.  Last tip is that it's more mental than physical until the day after, when the bruises, cramps, and cuts catch up to you.  All-in-all, an absolute blast!

A challenging running-obstacle-bonding ritual  Still a fan of the TM after doing the March 2015 race. MUCH easier than 2013, when it was done in February, when it was 50-degrees and windy, and people were stacked up in the medical tents with hypothermia symptoms.  Coolest thing about the race is the camaraderie. Our department did it together with some significant others, friends, and relatives. We make sure everyone finishes, that we raise money for a good cause, and we get some remarkable memories for the on-course pain. Also get to meet some cool people on the course.  The course has been toned down on the suffering side, making it more doable-- only one shock obstacle at the end; more obstacles requiring the upper body strength to drag and pull oneself, and pretty easy running. Oh, and lots of mud and dust. I'm still getting it out of my nose, lungs, and ears. Yup. My EARS.   Worth putting on your life's bucket list and knocking off with friends...

Just horrible.  Pros: It's new. Nice curb appeal.  It's new.  Cons: Parking during an event will make you regret the experience.  Once you get in, you see it's a cheap knockoff of a real outlet mall.  Shops are small.  Shops sell cheap versions of what is in their real stores.  Interiors of some stores area cheap looking.  No kids areas to entertain younglings.  Minimal food and snack options, which would be okay since you're in the Westgate area, except... Poor walking access to the main Westgate area.  We'll see if I'm wrong, but I can't see this place lasting a year and a half.  It's that bad.  Worth the trip to hit Anthem or even a real mall.

Novel dessert + fun spot  I used to eat bao bing as a kid in Taiwan. Snoh makes a variety of desserts with a spin on that, all of which are uber yum. They also sell bubble teas, but we were focused on the Snoh cups this time.   Combos the fam and I had: Gotcha Matcha (green tea), Purple Fusion (taro), and Smorrissey (smores). First, the ice is actually light and fluffy, so don't expect something super dense. Next, the toppings really make the combo. The folks at Snoh seems to base around a strong flavor theme, coupled with sweetness and something chewy/jelly. It works. Oh, sweet child of mine, it works!  We'll be back to try the teas and other treats on the menu. Prices are reasonable at less than $10 per person and the service crew was cool.   One suggestion: they need a larger parking lot. There are a number of businesses around Snoh and the place is made for people to lounge. It can be hard to park and find a place to relax.   Last thought: These folks are onto something special. It may be the next dessert craze in a crowded market looking for the fun and inspired. And for Phoenix, ice-based desserts are an inspired treat on our hell-hot days.

Quick, tasty, and unique  Stopped in for a visit as some family from out of town visited, on the suggestion of a couple co-workers.  Glad we did.  Ordered the edamame, French onion soup, spring rolls, pho, bun, and an ice cream dessert.  All were yummy.  The pho broth-- my test of a noodle place-- was good.  It had richness and good herbal notes.  The French onion soup is unique tasting and my wife and I kept debating if it was great or odd.  We settled on both-- traditional elements of cheese, caramelized onion, pepper, and baguette, but with some citrus-like notes and almost bul go gi type meat.  It's one of those dishes you enjoy and are perplexed by.  Service was fast and the wait crew was nice, as well as good with our kids.  The space is small, so groups of more than eight would be a challenge for them.  But, definitely worth another visit.

Chicago memories from a hot dog and Big Beef  Okay, that lead line sounds horrible, but it's accurate. My wife and I loved Portillo's when we lived in Chicago. Cheap, good eats and an authentic Chicago Dog.  My father-in-law spent decades loving the Italian Beef sandwiches.  Prices are very good for the amount of food.  Truth is there is a lot of hype associated with Portillo's coming to the Phoenix area from folks with Chicago roots.  It's a classic and old-time fave.  Food is yummy and authentic, but nothing remarkable compared to your places with innovative chefs.  Um, it's also not considered health food.  (Just FYI. :o))  The drive thru process may also throw people the first time.  I had forgotten how unusual it is-- order with a person who walks your car to the cashier person who then send you up to the food deliverers.    Regardless, I love that Portillos and Chicago Hamburger Co are here to fill the need for authentic Chi-town fare.

Excellent breakfast place  Had a work breakfast and came away impressed. Nice restaurant design and things were spotless.  Service crew was super nice and quick to tend to everything we could ask for.  Drinks were on our table within two minutes of order, breakfast plates hit about fine minutes after the waitress walked away, and drinks were always refilled.  Food was very good, though we ordered the basics. I'll take my family to try some sweeter carb fare.  If they rave, I'll update and give a fifth star.  They're a true Phoenix gem!

Flare, taste, and service all rolled into one  Tagged Squid Ink with a friend before a baseball game.  Very convenient location, event though the name threw me at first.    Sushi is very good for Arizona.  Plating style and service are both top-notch.  Staff was very attentive, took care of us quickly, and the bartender was fun to chat with.  Even got a discount on a Yelp check-in!  Very much enjoyed the Agedashi Tofu, Gyoza, Kale Salad, and Buffalo Roll.

Fast, quality haircut  Have visited this shop three times.  Usually two to three barbers and the two ladies have taken care of me on my visits.  Both do a good job to your direction.    Nice little place, usually get a chair right away, quality cut, and prices are very fair.  Can't beat that!

Best Outlet Mall in Phoenix  Stopped by for some shopping festivities with my wife and daughters.  A little odd in terms of traffic engineering for an entrance, but it's not bad.  And when you're in, it's full of nice stores with good deals and product.  I'm generally not a fan of outlet malls-- few have anything I really would want to buy, some stores have a cheap line they only sell at outlets, and the mall designs are meh.  However, this place is fun to hang out at and show your consumerism side.  Only real knock is the food court only has four restaraunts with one more on the way.  Clean and the options are good, though.

Rockin' Food + Communal Dining Market Experience  I'm batting 1.000, today. After an amazing brunch in Baltimore, took my wife and our little girls to PPMC this evening. I so did not expect Phoenix to have a place like this.  The decor is open, with rustic-farm appointments, and a deli-like ordering area in the back. We opted for communal seating over the bar area and outside tables. Service staff was super friendly and the place was hopping.  All the food was yummers. Best described as simple and tasty fare. My burger was straight good and wasn't overcomplicated by odd pairings. My wife loved her Cubano while our girls liked their AB&J sandwiches. The pretzel app was a hit, too.  As much as anything, the collegial atmosphere was fun and made the experience better. We chatted with a skinny young woman who was demolishing her prime rib and making me feel like less of a man with how she tore through it. Fun gal and always good to meet new people in a social eating setting. Kind of like an anglo version of a luau. lol  Wrapped up, I was impressed that the meal for four actually came with a reasonable price. So, we fixed that by ordering some extra dessert to go: Macaroons!

Fun food and staff  My wife and I used to live near the original Snooze in Denver and were fans.  So, my wife was stoked when I surprised her and our girls with a visit to their new location in Phoenix.  She actually hit me and gave me an arm hug.  It's everything I remember... minus the big mural outside.  Snooze is fun, quick (apart from the lines), and high-energy.  The staff is always pleasant while orders hit your table without a lot of waiting, making it easy with kids.  The pancake, waffle, and french toast options are always worth blowing your diet on.  I really enjoy their breakfast tacos with chorizo and a dousing of Tapatio.  Definitely a place to take your spouse and/or family for an enjoyable start to the day.  And the balloon guys was really good with our daughter.  She loves her mermaid.

Excellent option for some quick, good pho or bun  Wife wanted to try the new PT Noodles place and we stopped in.  It's a small shop, but you sit quickly and orders are literally in within five minutes.  Food arrived about ten minutes after that.   Their pho broth is very tasty and had a rich quality.  Meats are okay quality.  Service staff was very nice.  My wife liked the bun and they did a simple chicken and noodles combo for my daughter that she said was yummers.  Very limited dessert options, though.  All in all, PT noodles has a great thing going.  Glad they are around for a fast, tasty, and cheap Vietnamese option.

French Yumminess and an Adaptive Reuse Infill Location All in One  Wasn't expecting an option for French food in this area of town, but caught that French Grocery was down the road from my tailor.  It's more a deli/bakery/wine shop than true grocery store.  Still, you get the fix you're looking for.    Tried two sandwich options and the garden salad from their cooler, along with a pear tart, one of each macaroon, a mousse cup, and a type of cake that looks like a big macaroon.  All were hits with my wife and daughters.  Especially the mousse cup for my ten month-old... but she would bite through mild steel with her new chipmunk teeth for access to anything remotely chocolate.    Cheese selection was amazing.  Blast my Asian lactose sensitivity.    The macaroons were best at room temp.  The big macaroon cake thing was excellent at room temp, but hard to cut because of the cream middle.  But chilled, it was easy to cut and stiff to eat.  So, recommend cutting while chilled and then eating when left to warm for 15 minutes.  Sandwich bread was a tad too hard.  If they had a true grocery selection for baking supplies, it would have been everything we were looking for.  And the shop is a beautiful conversion of what looks like an old garage or laundromat.

Time for a Detroit Coney Dog Run  I love these gems: restaurants in Phoenix where people bring the flavors of their home towns to you. What's more, they do it with so much passion, that they shine in a crowded sea of foodie options.   Adding DCG to my Yelp! list after seeing it highlighted for its top reviews, I noticed I was nearby after a morning meeting in the area. Decided to drop in for lunch.   Staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door. The owner (I think) was engaging with folks and teaching a new employee as she helped me-- totally friendly and supportive of her as she figured things out, which was cool to see. I wasn't going to order my dogs Coney style, but they prodded/teased me into it. Glad they did. The chili, mustard, and onions isn't normally something I'd go for, but it was a great combo with the hotdog. And their fries are good!  Dogs and burgers aren't haute cuisine. And that's the point. The only things that matter are if its tasty as heck and if you have fun while eating. You'll get that, here.   A cool place to visit and revisit...

Uber yum... You must try  Looked up "Taiwan" under restaurants in Yelp! craving some home-style cuisine. Found Henry's Taiwan Kitchen, loaded the fam, and off we went.  Average strip-mall location, but that's outweighed by great food.    You can keep it affordable by ordering a sane number of dishes. We did not.  Eager to sample, I ordered way more than I should have.  On the positive, I had four cartons of food for lunch the day after.  Hot and Sour Soup? Superb and like my Ma's.  Authentic options?  Yup.  Our six year-old loved the dau jiang and dan bing (cold soybean milk + egg pancake stick), which is a traditional breakfast in Taiwan.  On the dim sum part of the menu, we had the boiled dumpling, fried dumplings, and stinky tofu.  All were very good, though we weren't as much a fan of the stinky tofu, which is served with kimchi and is missing the fermented sauce that my wife and I are used to. Not bad mind you, but not what we were looking for.  The Chef's Specialties were the best part of the menu.  The Three Cup Chicken and the Henry's Noodle's were truly superb.  I had forgotten this type of excellent garlic flavor and thick noodles and was reminiscing of time spent in Taiwan as a kid.  The ginger and chili pepper flavors of the Three Cup Chicken were equally memorable-- just be careful with the small bones with this cut of chicken.  Simply wonderful!  And next time, we'll try some hot pot/shabu shabu.  I want to see Henry's skill with that defining Taiwanese cuisine.

Beautiful macaroons and great value  We've turned into macaroon connoisseurs as of late.  From New York to Vegas, DC, San Fran, San Diego, and Phoenix, we get some wherever we go to compare.  Yelp! has been our guide to the top shops in all our travels, steering us toward our gastronomic bliss.  Yet we stumbled onto KAK when we were walking around Fashion Park.  We never even noticed the little bazaar-like Union, with a collection of tiny shops.    My wife, daughters, and I purchased a 14-macaroon collection.  Flavors: pistachio, champaign, mango, passion fruit, vanilla bean, peanut butter, and peach. They are very good, though a bit harder than what we were accustomed to.  Still, they taste great and are a fun treat.  And at about $15, it's one of the best macaroon deals I've seen.

Always a good deal to be found + Nice store  This Saks Off 5th is my go-to for name-brand suits, as well as occasional splurges on clothes for our little girls, some casual wear and gifts.  The store is open and (usually) well organized.  Service staff are very nice as long as you find the right ones-- the usual scenario where some appear there to help while others appear to be passing the time.  For suits, it pays off to wait for the Buy-One-Get-One or the 40% to 50% off deals.  Casualwear and clothes for the kids are always good for a look and you'll usually find something very nice at a good price.  I don't find their leather goods and shoes all that appealing on selection or price, but some in the store obviously do.    Tip: For tailoring, they will suggest a service, but better to use Yelp! and find one.  On one purchase, a customer came back to say that the one the store suggested dd a horrible job in his view.

Good meat. Buns are carb-crack.    Why, oh why, are the Texas Roadhouse buns like crack? Add that cinnamon butter and I'm liable to eat them all, blocking any attempts from my dinner company to partake.  "You want a bun more than you want that arm," I said... to our one year-old.  It's shameful!  Ribs, prime rib, and kids options were all good, too.  Very nice to have one of these close by in Goodyear, now.    And by the looks of it, there is some law in Maricopa County that says people have to take their mothers to Texas Roadhouse for Mothers Day.  Jeez... there were so many moms in the place, you thought there were some food specials for family interventions going.

Good spot for lunch  My work crew is a big fan of Cafe Rio for lunch. Line takes a tad long, but the staff is cool, they nailed the order, and the food is actually tasty.  Never a fan of staff singing.  In this case though, they actually seemed to be having fun with it.  Oh, note that the parking lot can be somewhat crazy.  As an experience, I'd compare this straight up with a Chipotle or Qdoba, but with more cheese and less cost.  Lunch specials are a good value.  Decor is enjoyable and cleanliness was good.    Extra star for the staff's really good attitude and the pride they were showing in their city. I liked seeing the Avondale gear while they smiled, joked, and filled our orders.  We'll likely keep this as one of our go-to places.

Different, fast, and good  Was in the area with my wife and girls and we came upon Wok Box. Decided to give it a go for lunch.   The vibe is a cross between Noodles & Co. and a Pei Wei. The staff was nice and quick with our order. The restaurant was clean, bright, and appealing. And the value for the meal per person was good.   Everyone liked their meals-- Dan Dan with Steak, Firecraker with Tofu, and two kids meals. Almost all was gone. The gyoza was more vegetable than anything, so would recommend passing on those. Other than that, fun, fast, and a good bite to eat!

Amazing crew and saved us from a bind  The fact is that Dose helped us out of a bind when plans fell through for another mover. Scrambling, I requested quotes through Yelp! Marilee responded in 15 minutes! She described options and we had details set 15 minutes after that. I put in my deposit in online and went from Desperately Seeking Movers to Taken Care Of and Confident in all of 35 minutes.   We had Brandon "The Hulk" lead our crew. Amazing guys and always moving. They did a lot of protective wrapping, were fast, made great use of the truck space, and we didn't have a single nicked wall or piece of furniture to complain about. The truck was new and well cared for. Dose even too our old living room set to charity for us and sent us are going to send us a donation receipt.   Couldn't recommend these folks more. The ratings proved legit and we met some cool people in the process. A+++

Fun Mid-Sized Cultural Event  Phoenix is fortunate to have a number of these events organized by community groups-- Phoenix Chinese Week, Japan Week, Aloha Festival. It's a great chance to celebrate cultures with family. And eat good food. And our family REALLY loves to eat good food with diverse pallet options.  Chinese week has a good number of booths in a park setting downtown. Parking is adequate, with only a small hike required if you arrive during the rush. There are options for the kids, music and demonstrations, Sister Cities participation, and food trucks(!). Very nice people all around, as well.   Definitely one we keep on our schedule for each year!

Quick juice meal with yummy pastries  Am a an of their Mango a Go Go drink for the occasional meal replacement.  Staff is always pleasant and quick.  They also keep the place very clean.  Noise is a bit loud with all the blending going, but that's minor.  Tip: Try the sweet waffle pastry things.  Uber yum!

Best boba tea place in the Valley!  Really glad we found this shop on a visit.  They have an amazing assortment of flavor mixes; a cool store design; and a bevy of optional add-ins like boba and less traditional nunu.  Teas are flavorful and the boba/nunu make the tea a blast to drink.  Only knock would be the pet names for the drinks and all the options you have available.  They need to figure out a way to help customers process things quicker.  A cluster of people (including me and my girls, to be truthful) is always jamming the order area trying to decipher what they want to have.  Maybe some tablet stations where people can choose flavor options, move on to ice type (rocks/slush/et al), and then end with the add-ins.  We shall return, soon!

Good burger and service, ESPECIALLY for the airport  Had some time before my flights and it was about lunch hour, so visited Nocawhich. I tried the burger, which was actually really good. Service people were funny and quick. And my order was with me within five minutes.   Drawbacks are that it's cramped with all the travelers and the prices. It hurts to pay so much for water!  Bottom line is it's a good option for travelers for pub food and a few healthier options.

Yay! A boba tea cafe in Avondale!  Stoked to see a boba tea house so close by. It is small, but a modern and cool space with WiFi a nice crew that appears to be getting their game on. Tons (I mean TONS) of options for you boba order, so be prepared to wait for the people in front of you and then on yourself. The board has enough choices to overwhelm.  My wife and daughters liked their taros boba slushies. I thought the Almond Milk Tea with boba was too sweet. However, the boba were perfect and I can tell them to make it less diabetes-inducing for me next time.  All together now... GOOOOOO BO-BA!

Holy hell, that's good marshmallow!  Saw a piece about FiM in Phoenix Magazine and here on Yelp!. Since it's our daughter's birthday, we said "A-OK" when she expressed the want to visit to celebrate. Glad we did!  The shop is a small one in a strip shopping center. Very nicely done and welcoming. Provided you're not diabetic, it smells like heaven walking into the store. It was followed shortly thereafter by a bunch of "Oooohs" and "Aaaahs" from the kiddos. And my wife. I just yelped softly with delight.  The young ladies working the store were super friendly and explained more about marshmallow cuisine that I knew existed. They were uberfriendly with our little ones, as well. When they heard there was a birthday being celebrated, they even gave her a free mallowpop. How cool is that?  The dessert cups you create are like a frozen yogurt bar. But with a marshmallow theme. All flavors we got were enjoyed and shared. There was not a single tinge of disappointment.  Beware: This stuff is addictive and the Mallowpie I ate the following day is the best one I ever had. Soft graham + decadent milk chocolate + soft and toasted marshmallow... [insert Cookie Monster noise, here].

S'okay  Was happy to see the old Costa Vida place get a new lease and the chicken concept sounded good.   Have visited their drive-through twice now-- tacos once and burrito the other time. Okay on both visits. Nice service staff, though a bit slow. The meats are moist enough but are bland to my taste. The big turn-off for me are the avocado and cabbage/lettuce mix they use. Neither taste fresh.  I saw that they have chicken basket type meals. Will try one of those if/when I go again and update my review.

Visited after a person on the corner asked us to turn. Said okay and it's a nice enough neo-urban pub.   BUT, after waiting a little more than 10 minutes with not a person stopping by, we left. Didn't even get water.   No drinks and no courtesy = No patronage.   Maybe they're better on other occasions...

Excellent macaroons!  Confession: I love great macaroons like a baby loves milk. The almond crust exterior, soft interior, sweet paste filling in tempting flavors.  Uber yum.  Macaron Cafe is now in my top three -- following a place in DC, another in San Fran, and now their booth at Fashion Square.  Great assortment of flavors from Cassis, to Honey Lavender, to Green Tea, to Nutella.  All taste great and induce squeals from our little girls. (I love them enough to share. A little.)  The two guys manning the booth shared they are based out of New York.  When I asked them why their prices for batches of more than 12 are *more* expensive than the smaller,they said it's because the larger orders come in a premium gift box.  Then one asked if I was an accountant.  He laughed and said I looked like one of those, too.  Ah, New Yorkers. :o)  Wil be back to buy a box or two as gifts...

Very cool taco and hot dog "garage"  I'm a new fan of Sir Veza's. Stumbled across the place when we decided to have lunch at the mall and yet wanted to avoid the food court. Yelp'd it and... What? A 4-star place here? Their food shall be had. Onward!  The concept is a garage restaurant-- garage decor, mechanics rags for napkins, staff in biker apparel, et al.  Cool look and vibe, along with lots of TVs to catch the games on while eating.  Menu is mainly tacos, salads, and a big sonoran hot dog. That latter was yummy as bucks. And the kids menu hit the spot with our little girls.   A bit slow on the service and the young lady kept forgetting things in her rush. She was nice enough though and I forgive her attempt to give me diabetes with an Arnold Palmer so sweet that my relations felt the pucker. She's young and with some additional experience, she'll be rocking it.  We'll be back!

Superior option for a healthy, well-bred puppy  My wife and I did a significant amount of research when choosing option for a new family dog. We set our sights on a Cavalier based on their temperment, size, and beauty. But, with so many options to choose from and reading about the many poor health scenarios for puppies bred for quantity and not well-being, we wanted to be careful.  We found two breeders in the Phoenix area with the parental pedigree and careful breeding we were looking for. By far, Donna, the owner of Hurricane Cavaliers, was the most professional and detailed. She was fast with her follow-up, had a great list of resources, handled starting the AKC process, and sent us home with a thorough binder when we picked our dog up to take him home.   Donna was patient and answered every one of our questions. That she fosters and takes care of the retired breeding dogs was impressive-- especially when we met two 15+ year-old grandmothers. For a breed that we read averaged eight to 10 years of age, it matched out goal to spend more for a dog that would be healthy for a long time to grow up with our little girls. The dogs are not cheap by any stretch. That said, my wife and I agreed that spending less now only to spend more later in vet bills and seeing a companion suffer is something we wanted to avoid.   One note: Competition for a Blenheim Cavalier is intense. A co-worker said something about them (especially females) being popular due to the show Sex in the City. I didn't ask for more detail, but it seems to be the case. Good for us that we were entirely cool with a Blenheim - or Ruby-colored boys. Otherwise, we would have been waiting a while.

Wow  Bypassing the disconcerting name that makes me think of fiber-induced regularity, this place is A-MAY-ZING. Be warned that the long list of options makes for a lot of combinations. So, come ready to spend a few minutes putting your tastes to doughnuts the first time.  The location is trendy and vibrant. The store is bright with pleasant staff. And the flavors make one salivate. FP's menu is split into specialty doughnuts and build-your-own. For the former, we ordered Blueberry Hill, Carmel Bliss, Chocolate Cherry, Dulce De Leche, Sand, French Toast, and a few others. On the custom list, you pick from a total of around 30 glazes and toppings. As they list, "There's no wrong way to make a doughnut."  The doughnut bread is of the heavier, cake-type bread. One could stand for a meal if you want. Key word being "if". :o)   Prices aren't bad, so you can go crazy. I ordered twice as many as I intended to, just because of all the flavors and the cost.

Good, quick, well-priced pizza  It's amazing how many made-to-order pizza places are cropping up. Pieology is an excellent option if you are in the mood and it's the favored spot for our little ones. Prices are very easy to follow and a good deal.  Entering, you have some standard options, an array of ingredients to choose from, and an array of drinks. You can pile on quite a bit if that's your thing. There are also some salad options, though I've never had one and can't vouch.   The staff has been super friendly on all our visits. They are very cool with kids, which rocks. Having options the keiki get to choose from makes it enjoyable and they get to be in charge some. And the pizzas hit your table in less than ten minutes, meaning it doesn't require a ton of time and patience. :o)  Another plus: Overall taste and quality of ingredients seem to be above par.  Good stuff!

Sable... Saw Bluh... Saw... Oh my freaking goodness, that's yummy  Caught an article in Phoenix Magazine about Pistol Whipped Pastry's Sables. Rachel Ellrich Miller was described as a pastry savant with street cred that includes working for Thomas Keller of French Laundry/Bouchon fame. She's also been part of the teams at True Food Kitchen and J&G Steakhouse, which my wife and I both enjoy. So, took a gamble and ordered the sables from Pistol Whipped online.  They arrived in two days, four to a jar. Took two out to enjoy with my wife and we were impressed. PW's take on the sable is crumbly, sweet, rich, and fruity. The subtle herbs are memorable and catch your attention. It's so good that you can ignore that the #1 ingredient is butter... which is probably also the reason that we sounded like a pair of Homer Simpson clones when eating. Nom. Nom. Nom.

Expected much better. So disappointed.   Wife, girls, and I were all excited to try Oregano's since seeing construction start at their Goodyear location. Lines were always super long the times we tried and not worth the wait. So, it wasn't until recently that we were able to check the place off our list.   The staff are very pleasant and engaged with our kids. Wait was about 20 minutes, so not bad even with keiki in tow. Location is also fun with a 1960s throwback-cabin-factory vibe. Kitchen is viewable and you can see the crew working fast. Noise level is high, so probably not the place for you, if you want some quiet conversation or romance.   Unfortunately, the food was lackluster. We ordered an app plate of fries and a Bistro Classic thin crust white pizza. The fries were tasty enough, but heavy with oil. The pizza? Well, it caused sadness. The girls and I can usually polish off a large white pizza like nothing. The Bistro Classic dough was so salty that it made sections of the pizza hard to eat and we ended up having half of it left. Very little garlic taste and the cheese was exceptionally bland.  Would have said something to our waitress, but she was gone so long that we didn't have time to confer. She did refill our drinks... as she brought the check and we were ready to leave.   Oh, well. There's always Grimaldi's! :o)

Yay for FroYo  Menchie's is another option for froyo in a crowded market. What set them apart in our visit was the strongest mix of flavors. Toppings are the standard assortment, but you have everything from Nutella to Toasted Marshmallow, to Resse's PB Cup.  Setting is open and bright. Staff are nice and seem to keep things clean. Prices are on par with other froyo places. And they have a rewards program. :o)

Excellence Next to the Escalators  Swung by Arrowhead Mall after my wife read that a Macaron Caf√© had opened at Arrowhead. We wandered looking for it, before resorting to Yelp. Finally found it next to the food court escalators, downstairs. We passed it twice!  Very nice gal served us and we selected an assortment of 12. Highlights were the Pistachio, Wedding Almond, and Cassis. Dulce de Leche was very sweet and while I liked the Matcha/Green Tea, our little girls thought it was too bitter.   Top-notch macaroon and worth the stop. Now, I'll just have to be very careful about visiting often... else my body shape will take on macaroon attributes. :o(

Easy Departures and Arrivals, Good Food Options, Lots of Potential  Terminal 4 is the centerpiece of Sky Harbor with AA, Southwest, UA, and BA flying from there. The best feature of the airport is the ease with which you can get in and out. If you are packing light and pre-checked, you can literally park above the terminal, elevator down, turn the corner into the TSA line, and walk straight 50 yards to your gate. Checked bags will take you a bit longer. But even parking in East Economy to save a few dollars is quick with the Sky Train.  Another great attribute is that PHX has a formidable assortment of restaurants Nocawich, Barrio Caf√©, Matt's Big Breakfast, and more. It's a selection you would expect in Scottsdale more than an airport. So, kudos to them for putting together a gastronomic assortment that far exceeds the bus station fast food selection of most airports.  Now, if only they would renovate the airport from the traditional darker, dungeon feel in the gate areas... Oh, and the wifi options are weak and slow.

Donut Nirvana. Ohmmmmm...  Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts hot off the line are like kissing dewy sunlight and double rainbows.   Great to see a KK come to town and it's super convenient off the I-10 and Dysart. Aside from the long line of cars and people stringing out the front door to the back parking lot on National Doughnut Day (in the rain!), the wait is reasonable and the staff is super nice. And can't beat the price. :o)  Once Avondale adds the planned Noodles and Company, I'll only need to leave the West Valley when I'm in the mood for good Chinese food!

Great Boba Option  Was in Gilbert, walked by Fat Straw at San Tan Village, and had to try.   Bright and airy store with young ladies who are very nice. To my request for no milk, they said all their stuff is dairy free and the honey they use is sourced locally. Excellent! Let us try more!  Wife, girls, and I had the (1) Taro, (2) Love Story, and a (3) Snow Bowl . The Taro and Love Story were both Panda Style with white and black boba. Flavors were awesome with a good taste without being overpowered by sweetness, like most places. Related, they really do a great job with their boba pearls-- perfectly cooked, not hard nor falling apart, and not overly sweet due to soaking in sugar.   The space is good for small groups, but would be hard to sit and work. Oddly, you also can't tip. I tried and the young ladies said they don't accept and they are happy to serve us. Nice!

Tops for Macaroons and Truffles  One of the best options for macaroons in Arizona-- crisp, sweet, and wonderful flavors accentuating the nutty breading. My wife and I are especially enamored with the pistachio, lavender, and passion mango flavors.  On this occasion, we ordered a tray of macaroons and truffles for Christmas dessert. The latter were crazy good... and expensive. But still worth it!  Very nice service staff, as well. The gal who served us was fun and patient, as we tried to make up our mind on what our family members would enjoy.

A near-religious experience for our little girls...  I had not heard of American Girl dolls until the announcement the store in Scottsdale would open. That's when I connected that the Grace Thomas video and books our eldest daughter enjoys have a doll and are connected to a line of stores.  As a dad, I am very positive about what American Girl does-- positive messages; no perverse body image like some dolls; the accessories build around stories and lifestyles without as much pure consumerism (e.g., VW Bug versus a pink Corvette); and well-written developmental books that are superb. The special moments the store builds into the experience of owning their dolls is impressive and thoughtful, such as ear piercing, trying on outfits together, and eating together. Apart from the premium price, a parent couldn't ask for much more.  The store is bright (PINK!) with a beautiful bistro/1950s caf√© that is available for parties. The staff is exceptionally friendly.   We got in the night before the grand opening and managed to secure the Grace doll my daughter had worked to earn. The Grand Opening Day festivities were all enjoyable, from face painting, to glitter tattoos, to balloon animals, to performers. We got there at 5:20 AM and made it into the first groups let it. We understood that there would be more giveaways than there really were, but no harm there.   And both our seven and two year-olds had a blast.

Was in the hood and in the mood for ice cream  Saw Fatty Daddy's pop up on a friend's Bookmarked list and was having dinner down the road. Worth a stop!  Ice cream flavors here are cool-- Lucky Charms, Cherry Amareto, Netflix and Chill, and on and on... Very creamy and the butterfat makes for a smooth spoonful. The Cookie cups looked amazing, but we decided to skip since we were so full from dinner. Raincheck!  It's a small shop with lots of staff and a good amount of sitting area. It is on the backside of a shopping area, off the major road, though. Don't panic when your nav leads you around the corner, seemingly away from where the shop should be. It's only yards away.

Amazing cab! Stellar service.   My wife and I have been fans of ACS since first trying the place in Phoenix. The style of cooking with the boiling bags filled with spices is superb. Messy as heck! But, so worth it.  We usually order the king crab and Dungeness, but have also had the snow crab. All have a different flavor that compliments well with the Trifecta sauce that we go with at 3-level heat. I usually have them throw in sausage for my bags, which gives an extra smoky flavor to the crab. The kids get the chicken fingers and the fried shrimp, then share.   Service is pretty quick and I give them props for keeping drinks filled. It's a lost skill with service people these days.  We'll be back. Again. And again. Until our skin takes on the healthy red glow of our fave crustaceans...

Large, huge selection, quick lines  Read about the opening of AZIM in the Phoenix Business Journal and had to make a visit. The descriptions are accurate: The place is huge (especially for an Asian grocery store), the selection runs the gamut, and they are still getting things down with the new store opening oddities.  Examples:  1) The boba tea place in the front can't make shaved ice until next week and wasn't going to be ready with boba for the boba teas until about 11 AM. 2) Lines were super long when we arrived, but most had pared down by the time we were ready. 3) Some of the worse grocery carts! With how they wobble, squeak, and stick, I think they stole them from the homeless to have enough for the opening.    4) Well-lit and organized store with a good number of people working to constantly re-stock things. 5) Some of the mini-stores in the AZIM aren't open or are still preparing to open. 6) No authentic Asian food place with some roast duck, roast pig, or other hanging? The Asian food place in there looks like something from the mall.  7) The surrounding stores around the parking lot are still opening/renovating/preparing. 8) Cashier was a bit confused by me using a credit card instead of a debit card. Didn't take long, but was an odd thing.  9) Prices are average to good for what we usually buy.  Good overall and with some practice and time, I'm sure it will be even better!
