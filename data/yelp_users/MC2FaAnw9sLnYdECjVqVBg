I haven't even been treated at this facility and my experience has been terrible!!! The administration staff is confused, unorganized and incompetent! I don't understand how they run a business. They might have a better chance of running a three-legged race against Siamese twins.   I am trying to get an MRI in which my physical therapist referred me and sent a fax to AZ-tech for treatment.    Az-tech was supposed to call me back the same day to set up an appointment. Didn't get a call that day. Fine. Called them the next day and asked them about the fax from my doctor and setting an appointment. The receptionist was confused and kept trying to look up my information. I told her I was a new patient and there was a fax and she kept asking for my name and date of birth. She was obviously confused because asked at least 4 times in a row. For Christ's sake and all that is Holy!! Write it down if you cant remember! She then told me she couldn't find the fax and would call me back. She said "The best number to reach you at is 602..what is your number?" Why did she start telling ME what the best number to reach me at?   Nevertheless, I didn't get a call back that day.    I called the next morning and told them I need to set an appointment and I was supposed to get a call back the last 2 days. I was given their standard 4 repeated questions about my name and date of birth and then put on hold. She said they never received a fax. I asked why didn't get a call the past 2 days. The woman told me in a defensive tone that they called me yesterday and left a message. I had never received a call, let alone a message!!!! So my call history in my phone and voice-mails must be deleting themselves?    I got off the phone with them and called my physical therapist. I told them AZ-tech never received a fax to which they replied they sent the fax twice. I was livid at this point because I had to schedule an appointment with the therapists but appointment to do the MRI and kept pushing it back.    I then called AZ-tech back and told them that a fax was sent twice. They were confused about receiving a fax (no surprise) and they put me on hold. They finally found it and set up an appointment. I tried to let them know that they "need to get it together over there". And the receptionist was bewildered and asked, "We need to get what?"   I called my therapist back to then set an appointment following the MRI. I expressed my displeasure toward the Gilbert office, so she set me up with the Tempe office at a different time.   Today due to traffic and crazy construction I was running late to the appointment. I called the Tempe AZ-tech location to notify my tardiness. They told me that their MRI machine was down and they tried to call me the day before. They said they would set up an appointment at 10:00 at the Gilbert location a little later in the day. I was dreading it with my recent interaction. With their reputation I decided it would be a good idea to call that office beforehand.    When I called I told them my name and that the Tempe office had set up an appointment for me at that location today because their MRI machine was down. Literally the lady then asked, "So you want to set up an appointment for tomorrow?" I had no patience left and replied, "Did you hear what I just said?"   So I repeated my name and everything very slowly.  Of course she asked me my name again and then told me the appointment was set for 9:30. I told her that the other office told me 10:00. DONE. Needless to say, I didn't show up to the appointment. This company is all out of whack.    If you feel like being frustrated have them take care of you. And if you are desperate enough to go there, give them a good slap in the face.

So I thought I give this place a try since it was by my house and seemed like it was usually busy even on weekdays which is a good sign. Decided to go with a few buddies for taco Tuesday since they advertise dollar tacos. So we order the street tacos that were on special and some beers.  I didn't have much expectations for the street tacos because they were only a buck. But when we got them, they tasted like they were literally off the STREET! They were cold and dry and bland. Not much to them, no sauce or fixings, just dried up meat in a tortilla. They made taco bell look like 5 stars. On top of that the waitress served our beer and brought out glasses straight from the sanitizer. When I grabbed my glass it was still hot and damp, which obviously killed the beer that was in it. That was a while back and I have not been back nor will I ever go again. I don't understand why people are drawn their.

This place is like the IHOP of Mexican food. Interesting variety.  Kind of a standardized feel to the food/menu. Get a lot of food for what you pay. Pretty good above average. Got the Egg chiladas and chilaquiles. A plus that I got chips and salsa when ordering breakfast. Love me some chips and salsa! Liked the bean dip

If you want KRAFT MACARONI AND CHEESE  at a restaurant, this is the place to go!! Decided to get a quick meal for my child and macaroni cheese was the only selection for any pasta type dish on the kid's menu. And with a only a few sides to choose from as an option I reluctantly chose fries. When the food came out, what appeared before me was boxed macaroni on my plate! I was in disbelief. I asked the server, "Is that Kraft macaroni that they made?" To which the girl replied,  "Yeah...well. ..that's how most restaurants make it." That made me even more irritated, that she would go as far to say that MOST restaurants use store bought macaroni, as if I was that ignorant! Not to mention, the fries were your standard Ore-ida frozen steak fries. I thought this place was going be authentic and fresh; I was sorely disappointed. I think I was even being on the nice side saying it was Kraft, for all I know it was store brand macaroni. I'm sure this is indicative of how they prepare the rest of their menu, with premade, frozen, out-of-the-box food.
