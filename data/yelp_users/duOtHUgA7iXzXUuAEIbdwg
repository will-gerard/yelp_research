working in north scottsdale now, i thought i would explore some bars i havent been to and take in some happy hours.  brennans is a mexican sports bar. but they show more than just soccer. a decent bar area and setup of tvs all around.   20oz football shaped glasses for 3.25 domestic was a little less than a preferred deal, but i do like that glass.   free chips and salsa is a plus, and pretty good. went with the hot buffalo wings. i consider them average above. not above average, but good for average wings. under 5 bucks. (im on a never ending quest to find a better hh deal/taste than zipps, not that i want to succeed at that)  im debating whether to go back again to try out the other menu items since it is a mexican place and i only got wings. maybe probably someday.   i think the off-track betting room scares the girls away cause i didnt see one in the entire place.  this place is okay to try if youre bored with everywhere else.

happy hour is good. free munchies in the bar area, like cheese crisps, mexi pizza, quesadillas, (chips & salsa anytime), cheap domestic drafts.  margaritas are good.  other food is perty good, sides are pricey, as a side of guac is like 4 bucks.  3-7p is the right time to go.

great place to strictly booze it up.   show up at happy hour which is until 9pm, 7 days a week! (1/2 off drinks/$3 liters of domestics)   or late night to hang with some hotties.  small patio. small dance floor. which is kinda a good thing.  they have a few small TVs playing sports and movie clips in between the good selection of music.  but just to drink theres nothing wrong here.

***updated 6/25/15***   -GOLDEN WINGS (medium). still best in town. hh price remains at $6, but the nightly specials for wings has been relegated to only sun and mon nights at $6.50. i gather soon the specials will cost more than the regular price. but damn that golden medium sauce!  their new beer menu is now broken down to domestic, import and craft. which is highly unnecessary with little options they have. just a reason to tack on a import or craft tax. like a corona costs more than a ranger ipa or some shit like that just cause of the category it falls into. get real.  not much new on the food-front that i can tell. burrito deal on tuesday is decent.  and the website got a makeover.  4 starts is accurate.  -----------------------------------------------  ***updated 9/2/11***   3 years later im updating this review.  -GOLDEN WINGS (medium). still best in town. prices have gone up a bit to $6, available happy hour and mon, thurs, sat, sun after 8pm. the new chicken skewers are a change of pace for the same deal.  -specialty burgers. still rock. sweet japaleno may have taken over the top spot.  -fries. they have grown on me since then. still not award winning by any means but i like them a lot. i usually get the half and half cause the onion rings are also done very well, usually.  -focaccias. monaco is still tops. but you can just order a side of sweet jalapeno dressing with others and it turns out near similar.  -most of the other food turns out to be pretty good. but i stick to the staples above. ranch chop salad is very good, but also far from a 'healthy' salad.  -beer. big mugs went up a quarter during hh. still, the best deal around might be the $8 premium pitches sat and sun, open til 4p.  id put this up a half star if it would let me.  -----------------------------------------------  8/1/08  ive been frequenting this place for nearly 3 years now, its our go-to destination for happy hour or anytime really.. so here is my rundown..  -GOLDEN WINGS (medium). best in town. (happy hour,  mon & thur after 8pm = $5). the extreme difference between medium and hot is not worth it. good but way too hot..  -specialty burgers. most are fantastic.  ask for any sauce "on the side"! youll get more. (black n bleu is my fave).  -fries. fresh cut. not a fan, but will still enjoy them if the option is there.  -lately, the monaco foccacia or however you spell it. the jalapeno dip is awesome.  -all other food is mediocre at best. salad's salad.  -beer = 3.50 for big mug (domestic) is a good deal at happy hour.  THIS (and the wings) IS WHAT MAKES US COME BACK.  -tv's can be changed to what you want if youre there on an off-night.  -service is typically good.  -managers can be douchebags (is that new?).  -parking does kinda suck on crowded nights, but dont be so damn lazy.  i do agree with some of what 'Jason C.' says, but will rate this place higher. hes bitchin bout little things. if youre there at the right time (happy hour or after 8pm) and stick to the right food(s), you should have a good time!   [this applies to the Via de Ventura ZIPPS also]  GOLDEN medium WINGS!!!!!!

SO FAR, this is the best PIZZA ive had in scottsdale. the sauce, cheese, crust is all very good. try to savor every bite. im sick of the chain places, and others like Nello's just dont do the trick.   Oregano's is VERY close, but a very different kind of pizza if you compare to their stuffed style.   anyway, i went in by myself and had a pepperoni pizza with 2 beers. 23 bucks. could be worse but def better than delivery!

i ate at the gus's pizza in old town scottsdale, and based on a few reviews i skimmed here, im sure they are related.. a 24-hr pizza lounge are you kidding me? am i in heaven?? NO. well, this place is next to uhhh myst? whatever that place is with the flames. would love it if those flames catch this shithole on FIRE (used to be sultry dogs). never before seen this building busy or close to having more than a few customers at a time at any given time with any given name...not surprised it SUCKED.  easily the worst pizza place i have eaten in town. granted i was a bit tipsy and its near 2am.. but, i ordered what looked like a sausage/pepperoni slice and some garlic knots, at $2.99, cause the breadstix usually tells me how a place fairs on food. the bill was $8 even. turns out i got the meat lovers slice for $5.01(?). could barely tell. it took them at least 5 minutes to heat up the slice.  the knots came out a solid 15 minutes after i ordered. jeez okay. wonder how long their so-called 32" giant pizza takes to cook. this is supposed to be a 24-hr after-hour club party refuge?? jokes.   anyway the knots did look impressive for only 3 bucks. 5 fat knots. to be honest they were cooked near perfect flaky on the outside, extra doughy on the inside. and the texture was amazing oh yeah!.. WAIT. eating them however was quite the opposite. completely and utterly tasteless. neither/nor with their garlic brush, garlic dip, or extra garlic salt. everything was so bland. the bread taste just terrible. even the marinara dipping was terrible and blannnd as well. i thought i had cancer or was having a stroke for a minute. i tried to concentrate on making it taste good, taste at all. not happening.   now back to the slice. not impressed at all. to be fair, it did have a minimal 'taste'. for 5 bucks i should be able to see and taste the other 3 toppings i didnt see in the first place though. weak as eff.   now the menu looks impressive with salad sandwiches calzones etc. the 'we serve beer & wine' graphic jumped out first thing. great advertising! "ill have a..." except the part where THEY DO NOT SERVE BEER OR WINE YET. ok. idiots. oh there was a girl that stopped in to order some cheese fries. i was like 'ohh good choice....' no deal. they dont have those either, or, they choose not to serve them at that time. the dude answered like it wasnt blatantly on the menu in front of us, and very unfriendly to begin with. again. idiots.  im giving this a 0.34 star just for being another ridiculous place for pizza when *pizza pie, joe's, and best of italy* are all within view, literally. literally! and those are all better even on their worst days. this only gets that much of a score since i didnt actually try all of their food. dont expect to either.  update: are you kidding me their website doesnt even seem to exist....JERKS!  update: really, so bad i might start picketing outside there tomorrow  "soft dough, but please go! more pizza? hell no!"  update: i made them their own old town page to bash.   jeff out!  ::drops mic::

we usually just go to the bar since theres usually spots open. they do get crowded during peak hours..  okay for beer. everythings pricey overall.   stuffed pizza is awesome with the right ingrediants.  (waffle) fries are top 3 in town.  wings cant complain.  good service. Shane is adorable!  'youre so Shane, i bet you think this review is about you, dont you?'

based on the happy hour its a decent place. 4-6pm daily and i think a reverse happy hour as well. sunday is when the draft beer is flowin for $3 a pint (kiltlifter and stella) which is the best time i would like to go. i went on a friday and had a couple $5 rum drinks.   the hh food menu is the key. $1, $2, $3 items. i had the maui burger w/sweet potato fries for $3. very good.   the ladies seem to enjoy this place as well as they come flocking in when hh starts.

sandbar is an attractive place. i went there with a couple buddies to check out the happy hour. ive been here a couple times before but usually on a weekend and wasted and its pretty cool then.  we sat at the outside bar where the sand is. if i thought about it i wouldve brought sandals. im joking.  happy hour is good. 1/2 off apps and drinks, so roughly $2 domestic pints.   we mostly enjoyed the food we had. i got the carne asade fajitas. good stuff.   cool bartender and plenty of girls to round out the atmosphere.   surprisingly i didnt get wings this time, but ill be back, and will update this review.

one star is for the tvs. good amount of them, and a couple giant ones. i guess it depends what game(s) they have on them for one to care. 2 floors which is kinda cool.   one star for the possible specials. daily ones for food and sometimes nightly ones for drinks, or something, it always seems to change. food still not worth it. if you can find drink specials at a time that suits you, maybe its worth a look. otherwise, dont bother. note this as a .51 star.  this place used to have better food/menu for about the same prices. i even ranked them having the top 3 fries in town. that has since changed. i went last weekend for lunch and got 3 measly dry sliders and fries for $10. my friend got a chicken wrap for the same price. wtf. pathetic.  off track betting which might be the only one around if youre into that kinda thing, you know, losing money. but youll lose it regardless if you pay for a meal here.

happy hour 5-9p with 1/2 off apps and $1 off drinks, woop dee do. other daily specials but nothing groundbreaking.   some of their wings are TERRIBLE. stay away from the hot and sticky habanero, its near vomit-inducing. other wings are mediocre at best. i felt bad giving my leftovers to a dirty starving bum kid.

happy hour is DAILY 3-6p.   a lot to like here. a nice munchies menu with $3 items, fries, sliders, WINGS. etc. good variety of burgers and they all can be ordered in a smaller slider versions which is awesome. WINGS are dry rubbed and probably the best around old town in that style. $3 all drafts of which they have 6 beer options going.   open and bright decor with a bar. they have some exotic meats to choose from any time. and the rest of the menu looks worth trying.  WINGS.

this place is perfect to get stuffed with food and/or drinks.   ill start with the drinks. the all day (fri and sat til 7p) happy hour specials switch depending on the day. but you can get at least a bud light draft or well drink for just $1 or $2.   small bar area if you just want to drink too. nice to pre-game a cine-capri movie...or shopping?  food: build your own bowl with a pretty good selection of meats, veggies, spices, sauces, etc.. the bowl may seem kinda small, but youre not adding the noodles or sauces in it. you can even practice on their website.......it can make about 2 meals...even for me. its $10 dinner and $14 for 'all you can eat'. not sure how that works tho.  (i signed up to their club and got a free birthday bowl!). some of what i mixed in was some chicken, marinated steak, pork, beef, celery, peppers, with a crazy concoction of spicy sauces. i cant wait to get home and chow on the rest!  those wacky mongolians really know whats up. its really that simple.

happy hour 4-7p mon-saturday.  all day sunday 4p to close (sometimes earlier, guess it depends when they want to open?).   1/2 off apps and all drinks and some select sushi stuff. sake bombs 5 bucks :]  good atmosphere, not a very large place so it can get packed during these times.   sakeeeebommmbs.

i usually write about happy hours. and this place has an all day happy hour. so ill recommend it. im not a big sushi/seafood fan. but i do like $5 sake bombers w/cold sake. the korean pork tacos were awesome as well for 6 bucks. check it out. thats all.

i ordered the All-American and got a sandwich, not a sub i thought it would be. for 6.75 i would think it would be a good sized sandwich but not really. just a normal one i could make at home for 87 cents. tiny bag of chips for 1.20 is not much of a deal either. i paid a lot for a measly snack. it def belongs in scottsdale. its walking distance from work, so maybe ill give it another try. but whatev.

was at this bar once before when it was called J Chew way back when but was so drunk i couldnt yelp that night if i tried.   noticed another name change and decided to stumble in here on a wednesday night after work. there were just several patrons at the bar so it was really chill. all friendly too.   some live acoustic guitar for us which was nice (Jeordie) and they usually have live music going on every night. stopped by saturday night as well with a friend. larger crowd on the weekend obviously but still a great atmosphere.  they have a full bar. no draft beer tho which i would like but whatever.  not sure about any happy hour deals, but i work too late to find out. i do love the layout of this place. small but very open. patio is great.   bartenders are awesome, very friendly! (shout out to Holly!)  overall OTT is a great place to get hammered and/or relax. and will be trying to get back there again sooner rather than later!

sunday, or whenever the steelers are on, junkie turns into steelers nation. which is great for me since im a fan.. every tv is the steeler game, so dont think you can come in and get a different game, sucka.  5 cent beer an hour before kickoff, breakfast menu, pittsburgh menu including pierogies, drinks like iron city and yuengling. not at a cheap price, but i guess if you really want that pgh vibe, its there. jello shots for steelers touchdowns is something to look forward to.  usually a popcorn machine is present, and an ice cream bar freezer as well.  waitstaff is typically friendly, pretty, funny, pretty funny, crazy.   for the rest of the weekdays, they have happy hour 4-7p. i think its half off apps/drinks. food is good. wings are good. they also have scattered weekend and nightly specials.  definitely gets packed and douchey on the weekend so beware.  get junked.  go steelers.

when i first saw that a 'pizza and grill' was on its way i was very interested as ive never bothered with the prior establishments there.  my buddy and i went there rather quickly during opening week only to find out they did not have any pizza yet....  after a couple weeks we decided to try again and see what could become of this place.   happy hour is unimpressive with drink specials. $2 domestic bottles is an okay deal, but $13 for a shallow premium pitcher seemed excessive. but they do have a couple good quality brews.  a rather small, quiet place with a patio and 5 flatscreens. it could be a nice place to catch a Cards or Dbacks game, that is if they maybe put the sound on.  but it really came down to the pizza. getting a 12" with pepperoni was an ideal test. turns out it was decent. toppings seemed generous, but the crust seemed a bit generic. maybe their specialty pizzas are the key(?). pizza-wise they are a slight upgrade on Zipps (next door), but thats not really saying much cause im not a fan of zipps pizza.  i was expecting much more considering the word 'pizza' is right in the pub's title. really not a good enough reason to go back as Zipps is right next door with better drink deals and atmosphere.  i wish them luck.

this particular location is great for pre/post-game Pirates as its right downtown on the other side of the river from PNC Park.  lower area has seating for lunch, and upstairs is a bar/restaurant area. the bar can be seedy at times, but nice enough to have a few brews with lunch/dinner.  the food is phenomenal. the ny-style pizza is one of the best in (and out of) the city, but the variety of the menu goes way beyond. apps/wings/soups/salads/pastas/etc.. ive tried a lot of this menu and im always satisfied.  my fave item is probably the buffalo chicken hoagie. incredible. chicken-cheese-sauce-buffalo fries... half a hoagie here is a large portion. the chicken parm is also a great sub.  with daily happy hour, pirates game specials and weekend deals its a no-brainer to knock back a few and try some food.

ALL DRINKS at 1/2 price during happy hour 4-7p. appetizers as well.   first couple times around id say the food takes a passenger seat to zipps. for instance the 'sundevil gold' wings are similar to zipps 'golden' but just doesnt have that same bite, ya know. but still a lot to try. and there is not a zipps in tempe, so this is probably the next best thing.  2-3 times the draft selection as zipps as well. pacifico on draft is nice! daily (outside hh) food/drink specials to browse on the website  outdoor patio is probably nice but havent had the chance to chill out there.  a pool table and shuffleboard, tvs, etc, etc.. a fair amount of co-eds to gawk at too. ill return.

i first saw a blurb about this place in a little insert in new times i think? then a buddy of mine had mentioned it even tho he has yet to be there. well he was busy so i went over solo after work.   the main ingredient ale house is a quaint looking place, kinda like, you know, a house. a good sized patio. good to bring a group.   *happy hour is all day monday. the rest of the week is 11-6p. drafts are 2.50.   decent selection of drafts, about 8 of them. none of that bud light shit. a few were from four peaks. first choice was the ska brewing decadent ipa. 10% alc. it was damn tasty. the other beer i had was recommended by the barkeep/server Heather: odell red ale. also very good. their bottle selection should not be overlooked either. the rest is some wine junk.  would like to go back, maybe try some food, and def try some more beer :)

happy hour every day 4-7p. 1/2 off apps and all drinks and some select sushi stuff.   similar to geisha go go with the deals but the atmosphere is different. a bit larger, brighter and emptier. menu items are similar as well, but not exact. when the shades are down the place looks closed, but i assure you i dont think theyre closed..  more saaakeeeeeebommbs.

happy hour 3-7p weekdays. drafts $2 domestic, $3 premium. four peaks brews including peach. some other decent drink deals.   at the time of this post hh is all day on thursday!  sunday is 11 til 4p. 2 bucks off frozen margarita which is just so damn tasty.  the food and burgers ive tried are all excellent.   the pot brownies are ridiculous. add ice cream.  whatever you get you probably wont go home hungry.

first off, these subs are packed with goodness. the guys that work there have been cool quick and collect. the place is comfortable to sit down to eat. sign up for their text msg club and receive some decent deals cause it is a bit steep at $8-9 for a 12", but you get worth from it regardless. they have a few salads n sandwiches but i stick to the subs.  THE BOBBIE is tops. thanksgiving anytime.  CAPASTRAMI is hella good. CHEESESTEAK is for real. GRILLED ITALIAN is delizioso. but, the SLAW-BE-JO is a bit too slaw-be for me.  i look forward to trying some other items at the risk of passing up a sub i already crave..  so far, so great.

5 stars for location! (the only positive thing) 3.5 stars for competitive rent price. 3 stars for amenities. -9.5 stars for new management.   i have been here a couple years. its doable and convenient to get around old town scottsdale (food, nightlife, shopping, etc). they are currently upgrading/renovating so that may trick you.  just pray nothing goes wrong or youre f*cked. most of the new staff is uncooperative. they are the only reason i want to move out.

After a happy hour and a taco monday, im on board with this place. the combo of those 2 would be ideal.  3-6p M-F HAPPY HOUR nets you half off apps/botanas. $4 margaritas and $3 beer.   APPS. the chicken tortilla soup is the best deal and quite hearty as its served in a big ass bowl, normally only $4. the brussel sprout nachos are next best, as far as a good deal at hh goes, and interesting with the street corn queso as a topping along with a fried egg.  the chips and salsa are questionable. you can pass on the wings..  TACOS. i liked them. i tried 4. normal size and $2-3 all day mondays. they have several different sauces to add to the eats, some good, some okay. smart doing taco days other than a tuesday. but really, shouldnt every day be taco day?  also theres a little ice cream bar but have yet to delve into that part of the biz.  good first impressions but this could easily lose a star with one slip up.  #sayyestotacos
