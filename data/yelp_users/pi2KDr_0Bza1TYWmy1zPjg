I've been Altered Ego three times. The first time I came in, I had a normal haircut, and the last two times I have been back for bang trims. I have been extremely happy with my experiences at this salon. All of the stylists I've worked with are knowledgeable and very honest about hair. Bangs are HARD, especially with my hair type, and I've been so happy every time I have gotten them cut. Bang trims are only $5! They take walk ins and appointments. Every time I have called the day of a bang trim, they were able to get me in and offer me various times. I highly recommend this salon to anyone who is looking for stylists with a lot of experience and extensive knowledge of different hair types and styles.

This place seems very laid back and offers diamond ice (I haven't seen many other places that offer it here). My cousin searched for the nearest coffee place when we were out running errands and found the Street. I would not recommend coming here for coffee (very limited menu), but there are plenty of options for boba, smoothies, and diamond ice.

the coffee here tastes like berries. I was told by a barista at another coffee shop that it should taste like berries, since coffee beans are actually seeds from coffee berries.  I've had the daily coffee and cold brew and I got the same bright, fruity flavor.  the staff was very friendly and prompt with service. there is plenty of seating around, now that they have expanded. they have wifi, but it seems a little bit too loud for studying. it's a super hip place and a good place to hang or meet up with friends.

Of all of the dining experiences I've had at Rigatony's, this was the best one yet! I sat on the patio and there was beautiful weather. I ordered the baked rigatoni and my boyfriend had spaghetti with sausage and Sicilianized it (capers, onions, pepper, and anchovies). We also had the bread and salad that come with the entrees. Everything came out promptly. The food was probably 4 stars, but the speediness and customer service made it 5 stars. Our server had brown curly hair (I think her name was sandy). She was so sweet and made great recommendations. She also took care of everything we needed, without hovering over us. I highly recommend that if you come to Rigatony's, ask to sit in Sandy's section!

this place isn't terrible, but it's not good. my beer connoisseur cousin came into town, so I took her here and I feel really embarrassed. the beer selection was super limited because there was a tap takeover the night before. I had the turkey blta, which was the most bland sandwich I've ever had. we also had the flanny's favorite burger (lured by the sunny side up egg), but the yolk was almost entirely cooked (what's the point in that?). the fried pickles were mediocre, as well as the chipotle aioli that came with it. maybe I had a pretty bad impression because of the live music, which i could best compare to a vacuum... it was loud and it sucked.

I've been here twice now and I have to say, Churn is delicious. I had Vietnamese Coffee and the Carrot Cheesecake ice cream and I was not disappointed. I think the Vietnamese Coffee ice cream is the best ice coffee ice cream I've ever had! They used condensed milk and espresso. They also give you an option to add toasted marshmallow fluff, which is absolutely perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. I am sensitive to anything that is too sweet, so I stuck to a single scoop for $2.75. This place is a must try. They are open till 10pm on Sundays, which is later than other places around.

More like World of Tears! I've been here three times now and finally I have learned my lesson. Though they offer a great selection of bottles and drafts, the service is absolutely awful. The first time I went, the waitress clearly did not know anything about the beer. The second time, the waitress again did not know anything about the beers. The third time, I knew better to ask about any beers (probably wasn't going to get much help). I did go to watch basketball (since there are about 50 million TVs in the place). I had to ask 3 times to change a TV to one of the games. The first two waiters listened to my request and then proceeded to DO NOTHING and then finally, the third time, a young woman got another server to change the TV. But he changed it to the non-HD version, so I might as well have watched the game from across the street. I feel like most people would have still thought the experience was great, but unlike them, I'm not mesmerized by boobs. I like when people know about the products they are serving and acknowledge their guests.

The Pros: -Healthy, affordable food -Generous portions -Good variety with salads, sandwiches -Flexibility with substitutions  -Customizable cold pressed juices  The Cons: -Really busy around lunch time -Placing an order for pick up can take up to 15 minutes (that is, if your call even goes through)   I have had the beet salad, kale caesar, moroccan turkey wrap, quinoa, and various juices. Typically, I spend around $15 (without tax and tip) on a salad and a juice. Sometimes with dinner, I will order a glass of wine. I don't remember being wowed by the wine, but I'm grateful that they have some to offer! It's plenty of food for me, and I feel like I can eat a ton.

I've only been here once, but I can say that my experience was a good one. They have a dog friendly patio (a bowl of water for the pups and dog treats), which was great for my friends. I had the saison which was refreshing and delicious. My other friends ordered the dark ale and the IPA which they loved.   I would love to come back and try some of the food. I have heard great things about the duck fat french fries (from multiple people).  The servers are very knowledgeable and helpful. They made sure that we were taken care of and that our glasses were always full.

it was my first time at nekter, thanks to a lot of hype from my friends... and I was not disappointed!  pros: -healthy -adequately priced menu -juice, smoothie, and bowl variety -loyalty program  -good portions    cons: -hours of operation (closes pretty early, 6pm)  I would love to see online ordering as an option for this location, as they do offer it at some California locations and this one does close so early. I've heard from a few people that the juices do not taste great, but I have yet to try one. I feel like a quality, healthful juice isn't always going to taste the way you want it too.   I am stuffed after eating only half of my açaí bowl! since it is blended frozen fruit with granola, it wouldn't be good to save. I'll come back and share it with a friend next time.

I've been to nekter around 5 times since it opened and I am so happy with what they offer! I've not only tried a lot more items from the menu, but the staff is wonderful!  I ordered 2 24oz popeye açaí smoothies, and they looked a little more brown than usual (instead of the bright green color). the staff was super kind and offered to remake the smoothies for me! I greatly appreciated the extra effort to make sure their customers were happy.

Overpriced/small portions/mediocre food! The food was pretty heavy handed on the spiciness. Not a problem for me, but the people I went with were not expecting it. There was a long wait considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Not worth it, I don't plan on ever coming back. Though it is BEAUTIFULLY decorated... The decorations must be figured into the price.
