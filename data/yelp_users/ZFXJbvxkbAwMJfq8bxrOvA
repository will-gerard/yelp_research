We love this place, been going here for years, gonna hit it up today as a matter of fact!  We have had several bday family gatherings here and the food is good, the staff are nice and the price is right.  I love their Peking Duck and walnut shrimp, but they are usually only available for dinner and on the weekends at an increased price, so that kind of sucks, but the fresh sushi bar is well worth the price every time.

Over priced dried out sandwiches in a cramped spot with crappy parking.   Go to Angie and Jimmys on Camelback.

Big, juicy, meatly, cheesy burgers with an endless combination of toppings.  The fried zuccini is also a nice change to the old burger and fry combo.

Awesome hummus,  taboli,  gyro and Shawarma, baclava and the garlic dip is a must have with your meat. Great people and good service. This is a family favorite!

The service was spotty the food was lack luster, the outside dinning area was very nice. But for my money I would rather eat at Arriba's or the original Garcia's on 35th Ave.

Used a Groupon to try this gem out, the wife and I were very satified and left happy.  Try the fried avacado with crab meat.

So here we go again, dropped the son off at school, late, no time for me to eat a good breakfast, so I start craving a breakfast burrito.  My buddy tells me the other day that a new place opened up by Basha's, this is the 4th business to open in this same location and the second Mexican joint.  It's 0815 and there's no one inside the place, but the staff, this doesn't scare me away because most responsible folks are at work already, so I push on.  There are two dry erase boards with specials written on them, so i try to find the breakfast burritos in the array of typical Mexican food offerings.  The staff are busy setting up for the day and finally realize I'm there and they warmly welcome me to their shop.  A man, who I assume is the owner, because he is dressed rather nicely for someone who is slingin' burritos all day, says good morning and I start questioning him about all their breakfast burritos, ingredients and combos, he tells me they have, sausage, bacon and only beef chorizo (that's to bad because my wifey cannot eat beef), so I panic because there is no machaca, no pork chorizo for my wife and no ham.  The nice lady behind the Ipad they are using for a register asks me for my order, I ask if they are only making breakfast burritos and she crushes my heart, when she says yes, because I really wanted a carnitas burrito for later ;(.  I place my order to go(one bacon and one chorizo) I pay a little over $8.00 for them and the old Hispanic lady at the griddle gets busy making our burritos.  I ask the lady at the register if the chorizo is spicy and she says no, she's right it wasn't, but they have a full salsa bar so you can doctor your burrito to the level of spiciness you like.  By the time I'm done messing around with salsa and those little plastic cups and lids my food is ready!  Before I go I ask for a menu to take with me and the owner and nice lady assure me they have them, but after an extensive search they tell me they are OUT, that's not a good sign.  So  I head home with my food and now I am starting to worry that I'm still gonna be hungry, because these are not the typical Filiberto's sized burritos that I am used to paying $4-5 for.  I get home and the wife finds her bacon b.b. and I get my chorizo b.b. she has eggs, cheese and a few overcooked strips of bacon on top, takes a bite and adds some of the chunky (not pico) salsa to hers.  I open mine and it is soaked in red grease, like most typical b.b. tend to be and I am surprised at the child sized portion of both.  I try my burrito and it is okay, but it takes a healthy dose of salsa to make it better.  Then I decide to try the red, seed laden salsa, that I know will probably tear my stomach up later and it is HOT, limey and a little salty, I liked it!  Bottom line is I have been ruined by Filiberto's, Armando, and the list of great valley Mexican fast food joints goes on.  For the price I paid, I'm likely not to return anytime soon.  If  Cilantro's doesn't want to be added to the list of failed restaurants in this location they need to increase their portion sizes and get more variety.

A new family favorite, small plates that are expertly made and reasonably priced. We came here with a Groupon a few years back and it's nice to see that they have added the eel, soy and spicy mayo to all the tables.

I stopped by this morning (saturday) at 0515 to get 2 dozen donuts for my crew, the lights were out even though the shop was supposed to be OPEN.  You're missing out on my business today and most likely any future opertunities for my $$$.  I wonder how many times a week this is happening to your small business. Too bad.
