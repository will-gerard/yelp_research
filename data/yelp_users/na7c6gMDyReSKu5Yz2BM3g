This was a bit off the beaten path for me - but I was looking for a grocery store that had more traditional Mexican and Southwest items in stock (I was looking to make Posole for New Years Day - it turned out GREAT!).  I went to Ranch Market for the first time and it struck me as a fantastic experience - far different from Bashas and Safeway! - I wanted to browse each aisle and explore (and I am NOT a shopper!!).  I was looking for one thing in particular - Mexican Hominy for Posole - which they had several options on - but I walked out with a full cart of groceries.  I am planning to return periodically and expand my shopping (and cooking) repertoire!!  Muy bueno del Ranch Market, gracias!

I have used PreFlight for over ten years I think (wow! time flies!!).  It is extremely convenient and easy, along with competitive pricing.  I have never had to wait more than a few moments for a van to pick me up - both from the parking lot to get me to the airport, and from the curbside pick up to take me back to my car.  Much less schlepping of luggage than parking on-site at the airport as they pick you up and drop you off at your car!  There are probably some tricks as to the more convenient locations to park within the lot, I have my favorites that get me in an out quickest (not sure if I want to share these!!).  I have even used their car wash services in the past and returned home to a clean car ready for me to head home in!  They have a frequent parkers program, online reservations for those busy times at the airport - and best yet, free (yes, free) cold water bottles at the vending machines as you are leaving the parking area (this is a fantastic perk during the summer months, returning home dehydrated from flying and getting into a hot car!).  Definitely a recommend.

The Clock Doctor is a great business, that provides excellent service.  I have been there many times over the last ten years whenever I need a watch repair, etc.  Most recently, I had a watch that I needed sized and I ran through their door right at closing time with the intention of dropping it off to pick up later, but they turned the light back on, spent the time sizing it and sent me on my way.  They did not charge for this either - even though it was simple, that was amazing!  Highly recommend this business for any watch/clock related needs!

Los Olivos is a good, traditional, Mexican restaurant.  Good food (GREAT Salsa!) in a casual environment - an excellent option for a relaxed meal with good food at a reasonable cost.  Service is always good.  Atmosphere at the North location is more open than their old town Scottsdale location which has more rooms - but food is similar.

Bicycle Ranch is an excellent place for both the novice and serious riders alike.  I think it may be a little intimidating to the non-riders, however the people that work there are extremely friendly and helpful so don't be afraid to ask!  I had a semi-custom bike built there and couldn't be happier with it - and their service department has always done a great job doing quality tune-ups that are timely and reasonable.  Highly recommend.

It's almost silly writing a review for Starbucks - isn't it??  Aren't they all pretty much the same?  Actually, that's the huge upside for Starbucks that you pretty consistently get the same drink no matter what location you stop at.  This location has a great outdoor patio, along with some comfortable seating inside - and the people that work there are always very friendly.  I am amazed at how many of them remember my name and drink preference, especially with the volume of people through there.  Quite often there is a line, but it always moves quickly.  It's a good place to say a quick hi to friends in the morning before tackling the commute and the rest of the day!  The first review says it well - "All in all, it's a nice version of a chain coffee store"

Gina is amazing!  She used to have her floral shop in a store front on Raintree in N Scottsdale - but after years there she determined that there just wasn't that much walk in business - so, she moved her workspace to her home.  She's still doing flowers and arrangements and does an amazing job.  Every arrangement I've ever had Gina do has been gorgeous, and lasts and lasts (and the price is very reasonable) - it's really an art form!  So, if you need flowers, I highly recommend Gina.  They deliver all over the valley (pretty sure of this).

Arriba makes an attempt to create New Mexico food in a generic kitchen - the result is decent food in my opinion - just not great food.  The spiciness is just right and there is a good compliment of green and red chile, and good variety of options.  The real issue I have with this restaurant is the service.  I keep going back periodically (not often) as I'm drawn by the food, along with convenience and reasonable prices - however, every single time the service is poor at best.  The servers are pleasant when standing at the table, but once they are gone - they're gone! - no place to be found!  You can get parched of thirst, have a mighty hungering for another chip, or be waiting on your bill - they just disappear - and this has happened every single time I've been there!  This is really probably more of a management and training issue - as it really seems to be the culture of the establishment.

Just an update to my earlier review ... had dinner at Arriba's on Christmas Day (one of the few places that was open!) ... it was crowded and busy ... not too long of a wait for a table ... the food was very decent, very spicy, no complaints at all about the food ... and the service was better than I've experienced there before (I think it was due to table location), but still have issue with ambiance, and lack of upbeat attitude amongst the employees (although my server was just fine - the hostess staff was working with a chip on their shoulders!).

I have always had an excellent lunch at Ted's - not necessarily the healthiest - but excellent!  It is easy to be intimidated in front of the lunch crowd when the cook is asking for your order across a line of hungry patrons - but it keeps the line rolling, and you get your food fast (without it quite being such fast food!).  All the dogs I've had there were excellent (never tried anything else - why would I - it's Ted's HOT DOGS!).

Thanks YELP! (again)!  I really like this place and would have never found it if it wasn't for YELP!  I've eaten there several times now, both for lunch and dinner, excellent Mexican seafood - very authentic.  Great flavor, great salsa in a (very) casual environment that gives a lot of the local hispanic flavor of Guadalupe!  The music on the jukebox is often traditional Mexican Mariachis and everyone speaks Spanish - a great meal and great bargain!

You can see my review of Dick's Hideaway to get more of an update on Richardson's.  Dick's and Richardson's are the same restaurant with slightly different vibes - Richardson's is where I would prefer to be with a date (unless of course I'm able to get into the private dining room over at Dick's!).  The two restaurants are in the same strip center (Richardson's faces Bethany Home, while Dick's faces 16th Street) - it's pretty cool when the hostess takes you from one place to the other, she'll take you right through the kitchens (I don't know of many places that are proud, confident and bold enough to take patrons right through their kitchens - this says a LOT to me!!).  So, I've been talking about the restaurant itself - the food is incredible - have never had anything that I didn't just love - it's great New Mexico style cooking with a nuevo flair.  I've taken many of my (less cultured ... i.e. gringo) friends - and they all flip out about the food!!  Highly recommend.

Dick's and the related restaurant, Richardson's are excellent - probably the best New Mexican food I've had (outside of New Mexico of course) - they are always tops on my list when choosing a restaurant.  Service has always been excellent, and the food memorable.  For group dinners, Dick's Hideaway has a private room (often called the 'family room' in many traditional New Mexico restaurants) that will seat close to 20 people I think - an excellent place for small business dinners.  Whether eating in the private room, in a booth at Richardson's or at one of the bars - it's a great choice.

Meatballz is an excellent lunch place.  I would testify to their food - except I always have the same thing - the Meatball Parm Sandwhich (excellent!) - it's so good I can't bring myself to order anything else.  However, everyone I've been there with seem to thoroughly enjoy their orders.  The only disappointment I've had is when I had a hunger for their Meatball Parm and they were closed!!!  Subway just doesn't come close!!

Great neighborhood sushi place!  Close to home, excellent vibe and atmosphere - easy going and never too hectic.  Great service, and the sushi ranges from excellent to good (I think it is tough to get fresh fish every night in Arizona - so, some times, some of the sushi isn't as fresh as others).  Check the website for their happy hour and 'two for' specials - always helps to feed the heartier appetites!

What a great location!  Tempe has given us a great gift in Tempe Town Lake, with options for many!  While as many point out, it's not much of a lake (there is no water-skiing!), it is such a better landmark than a flood/drainage area that is dry the majority of the time!    There is a path that surrounds the lake which is great for walking, and it also gives great biking access in the area.  I always enjoy watching the boaters and there are numerous locations for a nice relaxing picnic lunch (a much better way to spend an hour in the middle of the day!).

Thank you Yelp reviews!  I would have never given this place a glance set back in the corner of a strip center - what a find!  It's a regular lunch stop now - I'll never be able to enjoy Chipotle again!  Excellent burritos at an equally excellent price - I'm working my way through the menu.  Everyone that works there is very nice, salsas are excellent, and a great patio to sit outside and not feel like your in a parking lot.

I recently 'discovered' Centro recently (recommended by a friend) - and found it to be a very comfortable, relaxed setting.  A great place to visit and meet friends.  The wines have been excellent as has the food.  The food is created in their small kitchen in view of the bar (be patient as it may take some time!), and everything I have tried has been excellent.  Every time I go in there I enjoy myself - great staff, great wine, great food - very casual and easy going (just my speed!).

The live music on Thursday night brought in quite a fun crowd - lots of fun as it always is at Centro - which is a problem as it draws me back in there more and more often!!

I'm at Temple 2 to 4 times a week - some great people hang-out and work there, and the beers are excellent (try the Smithicks!).  The kitchen has steadily improved since they opened a year ago, still has a way to go but it's a step ahead of most bar food.  The steak salad is an excellent choice, along with the queso dip and quesadillos!  Lots of tv screens so you can watch football, basketball and hockey all at the same time!! wooo hoooo!!  Monday night and Thursday nights have been great for football watching!

Temple's 1-year anniversary last Wednesday was great - all the regulars plus a ton of people that come from time to time.  It was a good time, crowded but not too much so (never an issue getting a drink - and those free beers until 8 kindof snuck up on me - dangerous mid-week!).

I keep going back to this place because it is super convenient - but, every time, I wonder why.  I am always disappointed by the work they do.  It's a very basic car wash - they do not do anything special or better than the self serve car wash at Circle K.  They do not attempt to upsell as much as Danny's Car Wash (which is why I can't stand going there), however, they still make an attempt - I always quash this attempt with a comment about waiting to see if they do any better cleaning the car than they have previously.  For todays car wash, I did a quick walk around and commented about the towel lint all over the car (he started scrambling to clean that up) - and the water marks still on the car - he made some lame excuse that if I bought their detailing service it would just take 5 minutes to clean the water marks, but that he couldn't do it!  I was stunned by the lack of attempt to do a better job once these items were mentioned - but, pretty close to my other experiences there.  They charge a premium - and deliver nothing more (but to be fair - really nothing less) than any other generic car wash - they certainly don't do a better job than anyone else.

FitLife is a small, personal fitness facility with excellent staff and a strong following.  A very comfortable setting where you can receive either one on one personalized training, or workout on a self paced program with assistance as needed.  They also specialize in training athletes, both professional and youth, so it's never a dull environment!  I have been there for about 8 years and find it useful and effective to keep my other workouts more focused.

Lot's of reviews for Pita Jungle - and I would say that the 4 Star rating average is appropriate!  Food is good, atmosphere comfortable, service decent, price reasonable ... all good!  Lot's of healthy options with a Mediterranean flair, making an excellent option for a good meal out!  I've been back several times and  recommend it regularly.  Both visits I've had seafood (a seafood stew, and salmon), both times very happy with it - and the $1.99 margaritas (all summer long special!) are a great deal!

Made a commitment (to myself) to prepare a real Thanksgiving feast this year for the first time as a single dad - and this is a trick when my skills in the kitchen are minimal!  Yelp pointed me to The Kitchen as a source for pies - I reserved a couple of Pecan Pies - and they did not disappoint!  They were an excellent finish to a big holiday meal!  I also picked up some bread there and some cookies - all was absolutely perfect.  I will be back there every time I need some quality baked goods!

Curbside Cyclery is one of the best I've found.  Mike is very knowledgeable and an excellent mechanic (at reasonable prices!).  This has become my repair/maintenance destination for all of my needs to keep my ride rolling safely (and quickly!?) down the pavement - even though it's on the opposite side of the valley from me (but I do work somewhat close).  Highly recommend - great selection and expert honest advice!

The 24 Hour Fitness Active club is a smaller facility than their "Sport" clubs - but a great place for a solid workout.  The location is very convenient for me which I think is one of the keys to a steady workout.  Lots of cardio equipment, I'm always able to get on the type of machine I'm wanting (even on Monday nights which tend to be the busiest).  The weight machines tend to be underused I think, with little waiting - the free weights tend to be busier, but again very few traffic jams there either.  The staff is friendly, and look like they're helpful (I've not utilized their training services nor needed support - except for changing channels on TVs!!).  Oh yea, lot's of TVs viewable from all the cardio equipment - great to get a good sweat going while watching a good game!!

I liked it!  Didn't expect to as much as I did - it's a bit of an upscale burger place - but, it was very good!  They had only been open a week, but things seemed to be running pretty smoothly!  My son and I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, they were quite good. Planning to try a burger when in the mood for some red meat - and the Ahi Tuna sandwich sounds great.  Best of all they have some very good beers on tap! My buddy and I enjoyed the Moose Drool (yep! that's really the name!) while waiting for the food.  Sat out on the patio - with good weather, the patio is great.  I didn't see misters, those may come later, but the patio is on the East side of the building avoiding much of the late afternoon sun.  May go tonight as they are going to have some live music that I'm a fan of!

I have been back a couple of time and really need to downgrade my original review.  The service has been sketchy at best, and the last visit my son's chicken sandwich was basically inedible (I often think he is a bit too picky about how the food should be - but in this case, I completely agreed - it was over-breaded and over-cooked with scrawny chicken pieces - he went home and made something else to eat).

I thought I would update my reviews of Lush Burger ... I recently had an opportunity to have dinner there again, and it certainly seems to be evolving for the better.  They have converted to a full service model with waiters/waitresses coming to your table (nicer than the previous order at the register approach) which seems more appropriate for a higher end burger restaurant.  Their patio is fantastic in nice weather - an easy, comfortable place to enjoy an April evening!  Food seems to have improved as well - we had a Classic Burger, and an Infusion Burger - the green chilis on the infusion burger were excellent! - along with some sweet potato fries.  A couple of nice craft beers on draft as well for the beer fans!  Overall, I enjoyed and looking forward to returning.

For tasty and fast food, this is as good as it gets for casual dining or carry out.  Have not been disappointed on multiple visits - generous portions of very tasty middle eastern food with great service.  The jalapeno hummus is fantastic, and the yogurt toppings and all of the pita's I've had were excellent.

On a Saturday afternoon we were looking for a place for a late lunch, and based on the Yelp reviews, we picked Basil & Garlic Bistro.  I've driven by the little strip center hundreds of times, and never given it a glance.  What a gem!!  Fantastic little italian bistro, we've been back virtually every weekend since!!  Claudio and Nadine and their staff are very friendly and welcoming.  After that first visit learning that they were BYOB, we bring a bottle of our favorite wine with us for a great little dinner out.  Love their Pizza (grabbed one to take home and watch the Super Bowl!!), their Stromboli's ... the Chicken Parm sandwhich ... were both fantastic.  We are working our way through their menu, really enjoyed the Pasta dishes I've tried too.    Just reading through other reviews as well, and realizing that we weren't the first to stumble upon Basil & Garlic!  I agreed with all the positives I was reading in other reviews!  If you're in the area, don't hesitate!

Excellent service, excellent work!  I have had shoes shined there while I have lunch next door (I have to remember to bring a spare pair to wear at times!), and always feels like I end up with new shoes they look so good.  But, the best was, a heel piece on a pair of carbon sole cycling shoes had worn off making it very hard to walk in the shoes (I know - I'm supposed to be cycling in them - but sometimes you have to get off the bike to get a drink!); the heel was not meant to be replaceable by the manufacturer, but they were able to create me new rubber heels for the shoes so they function perfectly.  I think the total charge was $12.  I would definitely recommend!

We decided to try Tunisian food based on the Yelp reviews.  So glad we did - it was excellent!   We tried the lamb shank and the ajja merguez based on reviews I read ... both were great.  The lamb shank was very tender and the sausages super tasty!    We will be back!

First visit, won't be our last!  Some great beers being brewed at this new Gastropub on the Westside!  Megan took great care of us, even initiating a quick brewery tour on how beers are made!  The salmon and their house ground burger were excellent!  Looking forward to our next time there, we enjoyed it all!
