I wrote a review on the Chandler location and gave them five stars.  I love this Phoenix location even more!  I like the vibe in this restaurant.  There is so much character to the building and as you walk around you see that it's huge!    Our server was a sweetheart and kept replacing our bread and butter.  I ordered my  Mizithra with the bacon on the side.  If you have ever thought this dish was overwhelming, try it with the bacon on the side so you can control how strong you want the flavor to be.  I ordered an Italian soda and they brought me a Spaghetti Factory glass souvenir!  It might just be a seasonal thing so I'd ask first in case they don't always do this.  Great food and great prices as always!

The sandwiches are good and the people are friendly.  I like that they are open until 7pm, while most of the sandwich shops close much earlier.  The prices are kind of steep for what the sandwiches are so I marked a star down.   I had the d.a.m. Sandwich and the flavors are good.  The coleslaw tastes fresh!  My husband had the bangers sandwich.  It was 9 bucks.    I like that they have the pickles in individual baggies so the lunchtime crowd can just grab and go.   Also, they sell cookies and sweet treats.  So that's good.

I've been here twice so I'll review both.  The first time there was a Tool concert at US Airways that night so this place was packed.  (Is Tool in a similar music genre to Alice Cooper?  I don't know.  Anyway...)  the wait for a table was long, but luckily bar outside served food and the line moved faster than I thought it would.  We ordered the Wildcat sampler and it was delish.  Their fries are and potato skins are crispy and flavorful.  Also, their prices are not bad.  Our second visit was on a Friday night.  Wasn't too busy, which made me happy.  Plus, our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The Mac and cheese was more like a penne with Alfredo sauce, but whatevs.  The food is all around satisfying and I'm definitely making Alice Cooperstown a regular place on my list.

I am in love with the Phoenix Symphony!  I have seen two concerts performed by the Phoenix Symphony so far and I cannot wait to see more.    Most recently, my husband and I watched the Nutcracker.  We purchased the "cheap seats," which were still pricey.  We arrived 15 minutes late (tacky, I know).  This stunt ended up being a blessing in disguise.  Since we were late the usher told us we had to sit in the balcony until intermission so that we would not disrupt the show by entering through the main doors.  There were only a handful of people in the balcony so we pretty much got our pick of seats.  The orchestra was down in the pit (correct term?  Dunno.) and we could actually see the full orchestra from that angle.  It was like panorama view!  At intermission we went to find our actual seats, but we were turned off by how crowded it was.  Plus, our seats were in the second to last row which wasn't exactly a primo spot.  Mind you, Symphony Hall is not that big so there really isn't a bad seat.  We decided that the balcony was better for us so we made our way back upstairs.  The previous concert we experienced was with Broadway singer, Cheyenne Jackson. These seats were complimentary from the Phoenix Symphony via our apartment  management.  On this occasion the orchestra was directly on stage backing up the singer.  This was a more intimate set up, whereas The Nutcracker was more grand.   The Phoenix Symphony is a great way to sneak in a little culture and to experience one of the treasures of downtown Phoenix.

Stopped in just for dessert.  Their flourless chocolate cake sounds simple and typical, but my word.  It is the most elegant and beautifully crafted flavor experience I ever had so far in my life.  Just go try it.  Thank me later.  The staff was personable and knowledgable.    I can't rave about this place enough.

I like how the menu crosses continents.  It's nice to have options.  My husband ordered the ramen.  It's definitely tasty comfort food.  Nothing like the packaged stuff were used to.  I ordered jap chae.  It was a little salty do I marked them down a star.  It would have been nice if my noodles weren't swimming in soy sauce.  The waitstaff is nice but it took a while to get our check and I was starting to get bored since we already ate all of our meal.  To leave this review on a couple of positive notes, I liked the warm bread and sweet baguettes they bring out while you wait.  And the eclectic style of the restaurant was cozy.

I always have a fantastic experience with the staff.  I seriously feel spoiled with attention!  On my last visit, my first stop was at the Nars counter.  The gentleman that assisted me helped me to pick out products that were best for me and showed me how to use their handmade brushes so I would get the best use out of them!  After I gotten all my beauty products taken care of, my next objective was to find a gift for my Aunt.  I caught the attention of a sales associate named Lulu.  Lulu is an angel!  She stayed with me throughout the course of my search for the perfect item.  We went to practically every department trying on and testing out products.  We went through sunglasses, scarves, perfumes, bags and she never left my side.  Mind you, I had told her how important this purchase was to me since my favorite Aunt was turning 50.  It had to be perfect!  I finally decided on a Louis Vuitton handbag.  It was a splurge, yes, but I was thrilled with my purchase and it was nice to talk through my shopping thought process with someone who listened!  After my shopping was all done, Lulu offered me a Perrier.  A perfect end to a five-star shopping experience!

I asked my husband how many stars to rate Wongs. His answer was "four because the place is run down, but the food is good."  I disagreed. I feel like they're almost playing on the idea that the hole in the wall places are the best.  So they're not going to jinx themselves by remodeling.  To me, it's like they know it's the "hole in the wall" label that gives them their character.  It's clean and they're friendly so I'm not gonna mark them down.  And I don't need to tell you the food is fresh and delicious.  All the other reviews already did that.

I have only been to Joe's crabshack one other time.  I don't really remember how the food was the first time, but after eating here again I know why it's not memorable.  On my latest visit I ordered a dish of crab stuffed shrimp.  How awesome does that sound?  Sadly, it was so bland!   The night that we were there was Super Bowl night and the restaurant was nearly empty.  So I was a little confused why our food took so long to come out.  It took 45 minutes and it was only my husband and I at our table.  We're the cooks watching the game instead of making our food?    The food wasn't great and we waited too long.  We won't be back.

I come here every now and then since I'm in the area twice a week.  On my last visit the dining area was a little untidy.  And the service was unorganized.  Our meals are supposed to come with corn bread, but we were told they weren't ready yet and that they would bring them out to us when they were ready.  Halfway through our meals my brother checked on the corn bread and was told it still wasn't ready.  Mind you, we were not rushing through our meals since we were there mostly killing time. By the end of our meals I went up to the counter and asked if the cornbread was done.  The cashier gave me a look like I was bothering her.  (Um, the restaurant wasn't packed with people.). She said she could go to the back and get us some.  She could go back and get us some?!  Uh, didn't they say they would bring it out to us with our meal?!  Clearly, she forgot.  We're human, so no big deal.  What annoyed me was that we didn't get an apology from her and she made us feel like we were crazy for asking for the food we paid for.  Left here full, but annoyed.

Food is good and fairly priced.  I shared a regular hot dog topped with chili and Mac n cheese.  Also, we ordered a small fry with chili and cheese.  One thing to note is that they serve the chili and cheese on the side.  We found it a little difficult to just dip the fries since the chili is too heavy to be picked up by the fries,  I recommend just doing yourself a favor and pour the chili and cheese on the fries.    The cooks seemed a little annoyed and didn't really care to answer our questions about the menu, so I knocked off a star.  The cashier was more than accommodating though and even let us sample the Loganberry drink.  It reminds me if the juice from Ikea.  Pretty tasty!  All in all, four stars.

What took me so long to try 43rd Express?!  The staff was very attentive and explained to us that we didn't have to stick to the combos, but mix and match items if we wanted to.  I had heard about the macaron ice cream sandwiches so I was very eager to try one.  I ordered the red velvet macaron with chocolate chip ice cream in the middle.   It was so good!!  I recommend eating it right away before the ice cream starts to melt.  The texture is chewy and true to the flavors you choose.  A lot macarons these days are just sweet, but this place does it right!  The owner must have seen how excited I was because he gave my husband and I each regular macaron on the house!  I thoroughly enjoyed their customer service.  Since this was our first visit to 43rd Express, we were shown how to eat the dishes by pouring a special sauce over the meal.  My dish came with a fried egg, which was cooked the way I wish all eggs would be cooked.  You can see what I mean by some of the pictures posted on Yelp.  The fried eggs are crispy underneath and around the edges, and is just so perfect.  The entree I ordered came with a bowl of broth on the side.  The flavor rich and comforting.  43rd Express is now my go-to Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Five stars!!

Nice staff.  Quick, but thorough job.  The guy advised me to stop getting colored acrylic because it's hard to file down.  I appreciated the advice.  The place is older, but clean.  Good experience overall.  I gave them five stars because I liked how I didn't have to spend all day there.  Also, the gel was opaque.  There weren't any see through areas on my nail job.

How do you give Louis Vuitton four stars?!  My review is focusing mainly on the customer service, not necessarily the products.  You either get why someone would spend thousands of dollars on bag or you don't.  And if you're going to drop big money on anything, I think you should at least like it enough to want to give it five stars.  So that's why this review isn't about their merchandise.   I went to Scottsdale Fashion Square in search of a new bag for work.  When I went into Louis Vuitton, a sales associate came up to me and asked if she could assist me.  I had done a little research on their website to identify pieces that I wanted to look at in person.  There were really only need three bags I wanted to see.  As I told her the ones that I wanted to look at she seemed a little annoyed that I wanted to look at more than one.  It might have just been her demeanor, but I think if you're going to work at a place that sells high-end items then you should at least smile.  My plan was to pick up a wallet as well.  I felt uncomfortable even asking her if I could look at the wallets because she was so cold.  I found it odd that she would stick her hand out for me to give her the wallet back in order for me to look at the next piece.  It made me feel like she thought I would steal it or something.  Also, I wasn't really able to compare each piece with each other.  At that point I just left.  I was no longer in a shopping mood.  But then I still needed a bag for work so I went back the next day.  This time an associate named Julian help to me.  From the start he was the perfect balance of cheerful and professional!  This time I felt comfortable enough to really examine the bags.  I took my time and Julian was really patient with me.  He laid out each piece that I wanted to see so that I could compare the size and structure of each bag.  Once I had made my selection Julian made sure that I didn't go home with the floor model, so that it was a brand-new piece that had not been handled by many people!    Onto the wallets!  Again I was able to have the pieces laid out so that I could compare them.  I asked him if I could get my initials hot stamped on the wallet, complimentary service that they offer.  I didn't have to wait long for my wallet to get hot stamped, which made me really happy.  Because of my experience on my second trip,  I feel confident that I chose the right bag and wallet for me.

I had such a good experience dress shopping today!  I love Nordstrom in general for their customer service, but today Pamela in Dresses was exceptional.  She help me try literally a dozen dresses!  She was so patient and sweet in helping me choose a Tadashi Shoji dress.  She even offered to walk me over to Shoes and help me match my dress.  The selection at this particular Nordstrom is very wide.  They carry all the high and designers to rival Barney's and Neiman Marcus.  There is even a spa and a café.

The customer service at Neiman Marcus is top notch.  Every time I visit the store I am greeted by EVERY sales associate, but not in an overbearing kind of way.  And lets face it, their merchandise is not cheap.  So if I am going to be making purchases I want to make sure I feel good buying my stuff!  Also, the store is clean and easy to navigate.  Bonus:  I love how their store has the NM Cafe.  Its fun to be able to sit down after shopping and be able to have a snack (or full meal).

I would highly reccomend trying the UFO bread.  It's basically fluffy bread with a crunchy cookie coating.  You will not be disappointed.  I almost didn't try it because I wasn't sure about the name.  I'm assuming the name comes from the shape if the pastry.  I looks like a flying saucer.  I'd love to go back and try more of their pastries!

I ordered the Genova pizza.  Straight up, it tasted like grass.  The onions and potatoes were still raw and I couldn't taste the basil pesto.  It tasted like grass.  The entire meal I was wishing I just ordered a margherita pizza.  My husband had a safe sausage pizza.  I ended up eating part of his pizza because I couldn't stand mine.    Still I can understand the charm of this place.  It's tucked away downtown and has a homey feel to it.    I don't know if I wanna give them another chance.  Maybe, but not anytime soon.

I used to think Metro Center Mall was an okay mall, but sadly, it's declining every time I visit.    They have that messy Dillard's Clearance store that feels like you should get tetanus after shopping there.    Also, their Forever 21 closed.  I know I can't say all, but many teens and twenty-something's consider it a staple for a mall.    The food court is horribly overpriced and there's nothing wow about any of the options.  The last time I got my toes done at the nail salon here the lady gave me a cut!  And then she had the nerve to try to charge me $30 for a basic pedicure when their menu said $20!  The parking lot is so dirty and I'm always worried that my car will be broken into or stolen.  The stories I've heard don't help.  I used to visit this mall for years because of its convenience right off the I-17, but lately, I don't think it's worth going to when I usually leave irritated.

We went here for my husband's birthday on a Friday.  Got here around 5:30.  The place wasn't packed and we had a comfortable corner table.  The restaurant is clean and inviting.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in.  If there is one place I have ever reviewed that takes the cake for best service, it's definitely Feeney's!  For starters we had their amazing potato skins.  I could tell just with the appetizer that we were in for a treat with our meal.  The potato skins were meaty and crispy and crunchy and so on point! They were so generous with their sour cream too!   On to the main course!  Two words.  Beef.  Wellington.  Now I'm sure you've heard of Gordon Ramsay and his famous beef Wellington.  I had the opportunity to try Ramsay's version at his Vegas restaurant.  Feeney's version is very comparable in quality and a much, much more economical version.  The beef was so tender and heavenly.  If I had to make just one comment, it would be that the sherry reduction was a tad saltier than it needed to be. However, don't let this deter you from ordering this dish.  The sauce is more of a garnish than a necessity to the dish.  My husband ordered the prime rib.  I would have loved to eat more of his steak too, but I was beyond full by the time     he even thought to offer me any lol!  If you're looking for a low key date night (or any night) check out Feeney's.  Just be prepared to add them to your list of local favorites.

If you can avoid this theater, do it.  There are definitely newer and cleaner theaters out there.  But if you must watch at this location and your show will end after the mall closes, make sure to park by the theater.  There is nothing worse than trying to locate your car in the ghetto at 10 at night.

Tried this place for the first time tonight.  We ordered 7 different appetizers and one egg foo young.  It was a ton of food and I only paid 34 dollars.  All the appetizers were happy hour price.  I highly, highly recommend it.  In fact, I kinda wish we didn't order an entree because we got full off appetizers.  But the waitstaff was lovely and the place is a lot cheerier than you would expect. I only knocked off a star because the booth was a little hard on the rear and the boba balls were a little mushy. Lol at that sentence.  All in all I had a good experience.  My recommendation: squid salad!

The Mercury are Phoenix's BEST sports team!  As I am I writing this the Phoenix Mercury are in the finals!!  I encourage more people I the valley to watch more of their games because they are so entertaining!  The tickets are very inexpensive so you can bring your whole family to experience what most people in the valley are missing out on.   If you can catch the light rail here you won't have to pay the $10 dollar parking.  Support the Phoenix Mercury!  The girls work so hard and put on a great game!

I can always count on Urban Cookies to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I love how their menu is constantly changing with the seasons, putting you in a festive mood!  For example, on my most recent visit (it's October right now) they had caramel apple cupcakes, pumpkin cupcakes, and spider cupcakes!  Don't be alarmed, the spider cupcake was just their birthday cake cupcake with a spiderweb designed using white chocolate.  The seasonal treats are really pretty to look at.  Also, the flavors are inventive and fun!  However, you can never go wrong with a vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting.  My favorite!  What I love the most about Urban Cookies is that the cake is always, always moist and the frosting is never overly sweet.  I'm always saying to people that Urban Cookies has the best cupcakes anywhere.  If you're new to Phoenix, or just visiting, I recommend putting them on your list to visit.  Don't forget to try the cookies, too!  After all, cookies is in their name.

I have them four stars because my mom said it always clean smelling, like Fabuloso.    I deducted a star because the equipment is old and they do not have a pool or a basketball court.  However, I understand this is because LA Fitness bought this gym from some other gym.  That would explain why the facade of the gym is so nondescript.  I like that this gym is really close to my parents house so I don't have to commute to workout.

Omg the gourmet shrimp tacos are on point.  It's like the most decadent shrimp taco you will ever try at a fast food place.  The staff is pleasant and the food is worth the few extra minutes wait.  Careful of bums lurking around though.  This isn't the best neighborhood.

Received a dozen long stemmed roses from my husband for our Anniversary.  The roses were beautiful!!  And my husband would not stop raving about how great his customer experience was.  He described how helpful they were and how the flowers had come in that day to ensure freshness.  I can definitely attest to that! Our anniversary was on October 28 and its now November 8.  They were sitting on our side table up until today!

Shwarmas, man.  Do it.  Then wash it down with strawberry juice.  Ohh and the hookahs are fun.  The staff is friendly and service is quick.  I feel like Haji Baba is more popular, but I don't know why because place is sooooo much more delish.

We ate here for brunch on Sunday.  My brioche french toast was the best french toast I ate ever had.  It wasn't to sweet or too dessert-y like some can be.  What makes this place so great is the environment.  It really feels worlds away from Phoenix.  Its transitioning into the cooler weather now so i like how they had the heaters on.  The only reason why I knocked off a star is that the prices are a little high and you have to get your own coffee and water.  I ordered hot cocoa just so I wouldnt have to serve myself.

I had signed up for the Pizza Dough rewards program to get a free starter. That was nice since it was my first visit.  Both the hostess and our server were pleasant and never left us hanging so they got an extra star there.  The food, however, was bland.  The mushroom pizza I ordered was served with white truffle oil, but sadly even the strong, aromatics truffle oil could not save the pizza underneath it.  My brother ordered the fish tacos.  This sadly was nothing to write home about either.  Our friend told us some of the other food was better.  However, my brother and I ordered items that we would normally love on other menus.  That said, we probably won't be returning to CPK.

I have been to Mrs. White's twice now and I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit.  My first time I ordered the cat fish.  It was good, but really needed to douse it in hot sauce to really enjoy it.  My husband ordered the smothered pork chops only because they didn't have any fried chicken available.  I was really bummed since the fried chicken was really all that I wanted.  Service is friendly and fairly quick.  On our second visit we had the fried chicken.  I'm hoping our first visit was a fluke because the flavor and crunch on their fried chicken is to die for! We also ordered oxtail, which I had only ever tried served in a peanut butter stew (Filipino dish).  Don't let the looks fool you.  Their oxtail is so flavorful and tender.  Deelish!  For sides I had rice with gravy and greens.  You have to order the greens as a side!  I think it compliments any of their entrees.  My husband was disappointed to find that they were out of okra on this visit.  It seems that there is always something not available when we go.  I'm not too bothered by it.  I think of it as someone's home kitchen.  You eat what's available and it's almost certainly going to be comforting and delicious.

Ugh!  Disgusting.  Last Call is the pits.  I am a huge fan the Neiman Marcus department store at Scottsdale Fashion, but this Arizona Mills hand-me-down location is wretched.  The merchandise in general is broken or dirty and haphazardly strewn around in each department.  To give you an example, you might be delighted to see Manolo Blahnik or Jimmy Choo in the shoe section, but be warned: the shoes are still $500 and obviously used or mission beads on the design of the shoe.  So really, whats the point?  I feel like a lot of the merchandise found here is belongs in the garbage, not at a location bearing the name of a high-end department store.  As for customer service, the last time I visited this store I hovered over the jewelry counter for a good couple of minutes and the sales associate never once asked if I need help.

I was so happy with my choice of cheese whiz over provolone.  Normally I love provolone, but my husband ordered his cheesesteak with provolone and it was lacking in flavor.  If you ask me, the whiz makes the cheesesteak.  Try the sweet potato fries with their house sauce.

I had such a great time at Il Posto!  We came here for dinner.  The weather was nice so we sat on the patio.  I love the ambience of their outdoor space.  It's like you're at a cafe in Little Italy.  They start you off with warm crusty bread and served with the most delicious dipping sauce.  It was olive oil with pesto and garlic.  So good!  For appetizers we ordered calamari and the seafood fra diavolo.  If you can handle a little heat I highly recommend the seafood fra diavolo.  It's calamari and shrimp in a spicy marinara sauce.  It's served with grilled bread for dipping.  It's out of this world!  For my main dish I had the cheese manicotti.  It was good, but I could barely touch it because it was so full from the appetizers.  I did take it home and I ate it for lunch the next day.   They were very generous on the cheese.  That's awesome because I really love cheese!    My husband ordered the chicken marsala.  I didn't try it all, but I snuck in a taste of the mushroom sauce. Mmm!  Our server was so attentive the entire night.  We were there with our Aunt and Uncle and between the four of us we devoured 3 baskets of their crusty bread.  (I told you it's good.). I loved how the servers were so willing to bring out more for us.  Excellent customer service.  Generous food portions.  Flavorful comfort food.  Il Posto has it all.

This is the only conveyer belt sushi place I have been to so it's exciting and novel for me.  I live the fact that you can sit down and immediately start eating.  I tend to stick with the Philly roll because they put more cream cheese than most sushi places.  I love that because I love cream cheese.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the wait can be a challenge and you can never be sure how long certain rolls have been sitting out.

Nice pleasant drive thru attendant.  Quick and efficient service.  They ask if you're eating in the car and offer you a lap mat (see picture).  I like to ask for grilled onions and extra spread.  They are always obliging.  Plus, the food is good. Duh.

I feel like this Jimmy Choo boutique is an overlooked treasure at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  The Sales Associates were so friendly and helping me.  I knew what I wanted and since they did not have my size in stock, they ordered it from the warehouse and had it shipped to my house in just a few days! (Keep in mind there is a $15 shipping charge.)  Their shoes are beautifully crafted and a lot more comfortable than some other luxury shoe brands.

I had the matador.  It. Was. Bomb.  When the barista asks if you want whipped cream say yes.  Its like this, when you are going to pay $4 for coffee it better be good.    The atmosphere is hipster, but not like they're trying too hard.  It's a nice place to hangout, or if the weather permits, walk around the neighborhood.  It's pretty.    The only downside is that if you're not walking here, parking can be a challenge.

Best coffee of any Vietnamese restaurant.  So so so inexpensive!!!  Best sandwiches, best pho, best everything.  It's the quintessential hole in the wall.  Everything is a comforting about the food.  My ideal meal here is an order of spring rolls, barbecue pork sandwich, and hot coffee.  And when we go to pay I always pick up one of those chewy green coconut desserts.  My husband orders pho and I always drink the left over soup.  For about 10 bucks, you feast.

I absolutely love The Duce!  I used to drive up Central and see the sign, not knowing if it was a restaurant, bar, gym, or store.  The fact is that it is all of the above.  Upon entering The Duce has such an unexpected element as you walk in.  When you walk through the old warehouse you stumble upon one surprise after another.  Looking for the most satisfying Mac and cheese?  You'll find it here!  Boxing and yoga on a Sunday morning?  Yup, it's here.  If my description of The Duce has you intrigued or even confused, pay them a visit!  You will not be disappointed.  Make sure to check out their hours of operation.  Monday's they are closed, but they make up for it with being open late every other day!

We get our car washes for $14/mo for unlimited car washes and free vacuum.  Excellent location for those that work or live downtown.  The attendant are friendly and there is hardly ever a line.    Of course, it's not detailed car washing, but it beats waiting in the sun half an hour and still have to remember to take out a few bucks for tip.  I'm comparing it to the likes of Danny's.    So five stars for convenience, speed, and friendliness!

This place was great!  I ordered a large with custard base, banana flavored.  I mixed in strawberries, brownies and cheesecake bites.  That's the exact recipe I ask for at Cold Stone, but I enjoyed this place much better!  What makes this place extra special is how they literally turn the cream to ice cream before your eyes.  I definitely found my new fave ice cream place!

We tried Beckett's Table for the first time last night.  I loved the ambiance of this place!  Our waitress was fantastic walking us through the menu items.  As a starter, I ordered the special, which was bone marrow topped with capers and some other things.  I had never tried bone marrow before that, but I figured if I'm going to be adventurous I'm going to do it at an "upscale casual dining" place like Beckett's Table.  As for my verdict, it was delicious.  It was buttery and flavorful!  My entree was the seared tuna with a Mediterranean jardiniere.  It was the highest priced menu item, so I figured it must at least taste great.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.  It just paled in comparison to my husband's short rib entree.  No doubt, if I had to do it all over again I would have ordered the signature short ribs, too.  It was the kind of dish that makes you really happy as you're chewing.  Oh well, live and learn.  For desert we had their award winning fig and pecan pie.  What makes this dessert extraordinary is that ice cream they top it with.  I feel like it was the star on the plate.  The pie just complemented that cream cheese lemon zest ice cream.  Even though I don't have too much to say about my seared tuna, I still gave Beckett's table 5 stars because there were just too many compensating factors.  We will be back!

I'm writing another review at the urging of my husband.  This go around I am convinced we must frequent Beckett's Table more often.  My husband and I both ordered the short ribs because it was so good last time.  Just as good as I remember so that made me happy.  Last time we ordered the fig and pecan pie with the cream cheese and lemon zest ice cream.  This time I just wanted the ice cream.  Soooooooo good.  We sat out in the garden patio.  The heater was on making the temperature just right.  Our server was pleasant and made sure we always had bread.  That's one thing we didn't know from last visit.  Bread is given upon request so make sure you ask for some.    We love this place.  I encourage everyone to give it a try!

The cinnapies are sooo yum!  And their $5 pizzas are great for last minute potlucks.  Every time I've ordered from them my pizza was always fresh and generous with toppings.  If I had to mention a downside it's that they don't take Discover and I like when business take all forms of payment.  But that still isn't enough to mark them down.

This place is great.  With your pasta you get piping hot bread, choice of soup or salad, and spumoni or vanilla ice cream to finish your meal.  Prices run around 10 to 14 dollars.  I can't believe it took us so long to come here.  The food is not photogenic so I didn't feel compelled to post pics, but what the food lacks in presentation it makes us for it in taste and price.  The decor of the place is a cross between industrial and whimsical with a splash of vintage.    Great experience!  I can't wait to go back.

Nothing is better than having a Yelp Check-In Offer.  My husband and I went here for an late afternoon treat.  The chocolate croissant is one of the best I've tried.  I appreciate that they are open until 6:30pm because it means I can sometimes make it here after work.  I ordered a hot Miel Coffee.  I'm pretty sure that translates into honey.  It's different, but it works. My husband ordered a standard iced coffee, which was good too.  The barista was very friendly.  Nice little coffee shop!

There are three Thai restaurants in this area, all a 30 second walk from each other, but this one is my favorite.  You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes, especially their drunken noodles.  Oooh.. Drunken noodles!!!  Most of the restaurants in this area cater to the business crowd so they are mostly open till around two or 3 o'clock.  Thai'd Up stays open much later into the night which I appreciate.  However, I will caution you that parking will be a challenge if you are only coming downtown to eat here.  In general, Thai food is spicy and sometimes some dishes can be compromised in flavor if you order mild.  This is not the case with Thai'd Up.  I can order my pad Thai my old and it will still taste like pad Thai!  For dessert I like to order the custard with sticky rice.  The custard is homemade and will satisfy your sweet tooth.  The food is always fresh and quick to come out.  Prices are a little high, but that is to be expected for the area.  The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean. Give Thai'd Up a try.  You will not be disappointed!

The staff is friendly and the food is good.  There was a band playing but we didn't watch them.  We stayed in the lounge and had a late dinner.  Prices are good.  Five stars because they use Tilamook cheese.  My fave!!

This location is on the corner where 7th avenue, Van Buren and Grand Ave intersect.  It's a convenient stop for those in the area wanting a drive thru dinner.  Once you enter downtown Phoenix you'll encounter only dine-in restaurants (except for the McDonald's catty-cornered from here).  Reviews for this Church's location say service is slow.  I've never experienced a long wait through the drive thru and the employees are generally nice.  Sure, the area is a little seedy, but the most perfectly brined and greasy chicken is served from their deep fryers!!

I found my new favorite nail salon.  For so long I have been admiring their gel nail designs, but since I was such an acrylic nails addict, it was never the right time for me to make a visit to The Polish Room.  I'm so glad I finally decided to take my "nails" off recently and let my natural nails be manicured.  I made an appointment and got Christine to do my gel nail manicure.  When I first arrived to The Polish Room I noticed how clean and modern the shop is.  There were a lot of customers on this Tuesday afternoon, which is really great.  The fact that you have to make an appointment speaks a lot about their popularity.  Christine is such a professional.  She starts off cleaning up cuticles and shaping the nails.  I'm amazed at how quick and precise she is.  Her designs are so beautiful and she is so creative.  During my conversation with her I learned that she has been doing nails for 13 years.    My favorite part was having the designs drawn.  Before coming in for my appointment I had browsed through past designs she had done.  Feel free to bring in pictures.  Otherwise, she is very attentive to what you want her to create.  My appointment was topped off with a relaxing arm and shoulder rub.    It has been almost two weeks since I got my nails done and they still look great.  Still shiny and no chips!  Thank you Christine and The Polish Room!  I can't wait to make my next appointment.

We've gone to food truck caravan 3 times now and these guys have been there every time.  The lines are always the longest at this truck so we avoided them the first two times.  This last time we got to food truck caravan early so we decided to try Grilled Cheese while the line was short.  We ordered the Fully Loaded which is a grilled cheese with Mac and cheese and BBQ pulled pork on French bread.  Not surprising, it was very good.  We also ordered a grilled banana French toast, which was just ok.  As good as the Fully Loaded is, it was still a little pricy.  Also, I wouldn't wait the long lines for it.  So for those two reasons I took away a star.  Other than that, they do make a nice grilled cheese.

Worth the wait!  Keep in mind there is always a wait.  They have a a water dispenser outside and benches while you wait.  I prefer to keep an eye out for the limited waiting area seating inside, though!!  While waiting, people forget the seats inside free up as those people are call to their tables.  Staff is very efficient, yet still personable to their customers.  On our last visit I loved how the hostess called me by name when she came by to check on my table.  And you don't just have one person checking up on you.  They all do!    Now, on to the food.  There is a reason why Matt's Big Breakfast is iconic here in Phoenix.  It's delicious!  The menu is simple and straight forward, but anything you order is phenomenal.  And although you've had a version of everything on the menu before, the way Matt's make it is so much better!  They also have specials so even if you visit more than a few times you can still try something a little different on each visit.

I booked the Nobu hotel for Thanksgiving.  This is the first hotel I've stayed at in three years outside of the Intercontinental hotel group.  I admit, I am a hotel snob, I expect a lot when we stay at hotels of a certain caliber.    Nobu met most of my expectations.  Nobu is a hotel inside Caesars Palace (yes, a hotel inside a hotel).  We arrived at Caesars around 1:30pm Thanksgiving day and the line to valet was a mile long.  In fact the valet line specific to Nobu said closed so we turned around and got into another valet line.  Upon getting up to an attendant we were told that the first line we were in was actually the correct one and that even if the sign said full they would take us because we were Nobu guests (and not just Caesars guests, I guess?).  Anyway, after all that, check-in was an absolute breeze.  When we entered Caesars there was a massive line of people with their luggage at the the check-in counter.  As a guest at Nobu you check-in at the concierge floor at the Nobu.  Remember, it's about 1:30pm and we got to check-in to our room immediately.    I asked that hot tea be sent up to our room since I had a cough.  They sent it up almost immediately.  Also, our bags were sent up from valet almost immediately.  I think you get the picture.  Everything at Nobu is fast.  The decor is very zen minimalist.  I love how exclusive Nobu feels.  They have unlimited water bottles, fruit, tea and coffee available at the concierge floor.  Also, their bath products are Natura Bisse.  They sells the brand Barneys, hello! :)  My favorite part of our stay at Nobu was the breakfast.  We chose our breakfast items the night before from the menu they provided at turn down.  The Nobu hotel is the only place you can get a Nobu breakfast. It was delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  My one regret is that we didn't do room service that night, because the menu looked equally good.  I guess, we'll have to visit again soon!  What's also cool about staying in a hotel within a hotel is that we had access to Caesars' legendary pool (well, pools, there's about four of them). We were pleasantly surprised to find that one of the pools was heated.  And not just a luke warm temperature. It was verging on hot.  Keep in mind that this is late November so it's pretty cold out.  I remember thinking as we were swimming, if this doesn't justify a five star review, then I don't know what does.  On the day we were checking out, they offered to store our bags if we weren't ready to leave Vegas at that moment.  Also, I had forgotten the slippers the hotel provided so the front desk kindly requested a brand new pair be brought down for my husband and I. Top notch service!  We will return.

Fantastic event!  This review is long overdue.  This year was my second year attending Check Please AZ at Cityscape.  The sample portions are huge at every station.  The lines can be long, but they go fast since everything is just grab and go.  All the best restaurants get together that were featured on the show and completely spoil us!    My favorite this year was Amy's Baking Company.  She featured sweet and savory options, but her sweet treats were my favorite!  If you are a foodie and lover of local cuisine I highly recommend experiencing this event.

Pomo, I  you.  Came in for lunch on a Saturday.  Ordered the Regina Margherita and the panna cotta for dessert.  Every single bite was perfect!  The people are nice, the restaurant is clean.    The Regina Margherita is one of the best I tried.  They provide a bottle of olive oil on the table which I did use to drizzle on each slice.  It made my pizza extra juicy.  The pizza is fantastic on its own though.  I ordered the panna cotta, something I always wanted to try.  It came out plated beautifully with fruits and fried bread with powdered sugar.  Amazing!!  I would give Pomo 10 stars if I could.

I was looking for an ice cream place late last night and found this place next to Jobots.  The flavor choices are unique and everything I sampled was very good. I got a scoop of the Greek yogurt and the carrot cake I wish I got a scoop of the cucumber sorbet, but I knew I couldn't finish 3 scoops.  I love how the ice cream is served in a takeout container with a fortune cookie.  Definitely a special little place!

Harumi is one of the better sushi restaurants in Downtown Phoenix.  The staff is always friendly, no matter how busy they are and no matter how rowdy their  customers get.  They are great at making recommendations from their menu.  My new favorite is the Ahi Tower.  It's beautiful and packed with flavor!    If you are in the downtown area I would recommend Harumi.  It's not as swanky as some of their competition, but the fish here tastes fresher and service is more attentive.  One thing to note: the rice they use is purple-colored.  If you read the explanation on the monitor you learn that it's a super-food.  I love this concept!  I have taken visitors here on several occasions and they've all ended up loving Harumi!

I didn't like coming here at first because, on one occasion, my husband saw a bug on the counter.  So it was a little bit of a turn off.    I also thought their yogurt was a little bit pricier than other frozen yogurt shops.  Come to think of it, I don't really know how much the cost is per ounce since they don't display pricing anywhere.  If the cost is displayed somewhere, I've obviously missed it on several occasions.  Its only when the cashier weighs your cup do you realize what you're paying.    The shop occupies a corner of the Alliance Bank building at Cityscape.  Its a small location so you don't have a large selection of flavors of yogurt.  (This is fine by me since I only ever get the tart yogurt.)  They do have a pretty wide selection of toppings though.  They even have store bought cookies that you can put in your yogurt bowl if you wanna mix it up a bit. I loooove their cheesecake bites!    Yogurt Time is the only one of its kind in the area that stays open after the business crowd leaves for the day.  I live in the area so they have come to my rescue on nights when I want a sweet treat!

I give the pizza four stars and the customer service five stars.  My husband and I dined in and ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and basil.  The flavor is great, but the crust is a little thicker and the ratio between toppings and crust is not quite balanced.  I will say, the place is popular though.  During dinner there was a steady stream of people picking up pizzas.    The employees are so nice and accommodating.  Our waitress always made sure we had full cups of water.  Also, I like the "rustic" walls and attention to detail in the decor.

I love speed and convenience here.  My favorite pizza is off the Starving Artist menu is the island pizza.  The Margherita pizza is good too.    There is also the option to create your own pizza with unlimited toppings for 2 dollars more, but the one time I did that I didn't like it very much.  Too many toppings proved to be overwhelming so I recommend trying one from the starving artists menu if it is your first time since the combinations are tried and true.

I was on the hunt for a new work bag so I started calling  different local stores to inquire about the handbags they had in their inventory.  Disappointed by the selection in my area I called, randomly, 5 hours away to one of the Céline boutiques in Las Vegas.    Nicole was great!  She offered to text me pictures of the bags in stock.  She sent me multiple styles and colors and was always quick to respond when I had questions.  It took me a couple of days to decide on THE one.  All through the selection process I never felt pressured or rushed.  I had such a great experience shopping with Céline even before I ever set foot in their store.  I was amazed at how quickly my purchase arrived.  I ordered the handbag on a Tuesday and was carrying it on my arm by Thursday.  On a recent trip to Vegas I made it a point to visit the Céline store at Crystals.  All of the staff was very friendly and helpful as I tried on their jewelry.  Highly recommended!

I am really glad Sydney's came to Tempe Marketplace.  I tried the Oreo/Nutella empanada with whipped cream.  It had lots of yummy filling, not overly doughy like some empanadas can be.  The current check-in offer allowed me to try their fresh homemade lemonade.  Yum!  Service was good too.  The staff is friendly and doting.  Great place!  Keep it up!

Grabba Green is a hip and healthy option in the heart of downtown.  Also, it's an ideal place to get some grub after hitting Eos or Orange Theory.    Some of the bowls on the menu combines ingredients you would not expect, but they make the dishes fun.  Also, you can put together your own combinations. (just remember to add sauce otherwise it might come out bland, especially if you're not a healthy food eater on a daily basis.)  We went on a very busy night. Needless to say, the wait was pretty long, but the staff was friendly and patient. They even compensated us by giving a card for a free drink/meal. That's a free $10 meal. You can clearly see that the folks at Grabba Green care for their customers. They just want everyone to have a good dining experience.

I'm in love with Orange Theory.  I have been going since this location opened.  I'd heard about the workout through the radio for a couple of years, but I always thought it would be too expensive or too hard of a workout.    Let me just say first, I used to hate working out.  I was one of those people who would actually get depressed when I went to a gym.  Orange Theory changed my attitude about working out!  I think the main reason why I would get "depressed" about exercise before this that I didn't know what I was doing on the machines.  And since my workouts were not effective I rarely saw results the results that I thought I should see.  So when I joined Orange Theory I was skeptical, but hopeful.  I started off with the classes a month package, but I found myself actually want to go more often than!  So I signed up for the unlimited classes package and it was the best investment I've made this year.    The classes are fun because you don't do the same thing for too long of a timeframe.  Also, the instructors Ryan, Fuego, Brooke and Colton turn on the beast mode in all of us with their energy.  All of the staff make the experience great.  They know all of our names and great is when we walk in.  I highly recommend Orange Theory to everyone!

I expected to pay a ton because I was thinking it was "gourmet" hot dogs, but their prices are reasonable.  Try the strawberry shortcake. It's a generous portion and tastes better than it looks.  The drive though is really convenient and the people working are pretty nice.  Food is better than average.  I didn't mark them down for anything because the experience was good.

New coffee spot in the neighborhood.  Located in a multi-use building (there's also a hair studio and a small art gallery there).  They have a clean, minimalist aesthetic, which I love.    The barista was super friend and took time to explain the menu.  I ordered the Cáscara, which is a tea brewed from the fruit of the coffee bean.  I ordered mine iced with sparkling water.  Very refreshing on that hot day!  It reminded me of something between a tamarind and a hibiscus tea.  I love the concept of this place!  Will definite return.
