this was my first item going to the green house. after a night of shopping and tired feet the choice was hard but felt this would take the hungriness away. we walked in caring our Starbucks cups which caught them off guard.  the service was good a little slow but good.  i pick a sandwich that they made into a salad for me. it was amazing but probable better as a sandwich but still great.  i will be going back because i was great!

this pizza is so so. i get pizza there for my husband and son. they seem to like it and they have a coupon card. so every pizza you order you get some $ off. we paid $2.00 tonight for our pizza. great deal.

LOVE THIS PLACE!  i could eat here all the time.  i always go for lunch with friends or for dinner with family.  great for kids.  there is grass for the kids to run around on.  it is like going on a picnic at the park but with great food.  we go about once a month! well maybe more!

okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!

did not like at all.  there was a funny smell in the place when we walked in.  kind of like and old persons house.  there wasn't a lot of choices.  my husband like the place but dosen't take much to make him happy.  i did not like it at all.  the food was bad the place smelled.  not much else to say.  the man that worked there was nice!  i try to find something good every place i go and that was what i could find.
