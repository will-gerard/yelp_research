This is the best location to go for all your tire needs! Brandon is such a sweetheart! The tire techs are so polite and positive towards each other as well as their customers. I had the best experience here yesterday morning. I felt comfortable, and all my worries about being able to trust anyone in the automotive industry again, were put to rest when I arrived here. They were trustworthy, helpful and absolutely there for the customer's needs. Thank you guys for the fantastic job you did & for putting my mind at ease! =)

First time here. I ordered a breakfast burrito & it was DELICIOUS!!! I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner. I drove from Mesa just to check this place out & I was seriously not disappointed!  Definately authentic Mexican food. So much YUM!

Tonight was the very first time I've ever tried the food here. I must say it was pretty tasty! I loved the Hawaiian BBQ Beef. It came with 2 scoops of sticky white rice & deeelicious macaroni salad. I highly recommend this place if you've never had authentic Hawaiian Food, Or if you have & you're just searching for something better than you've ever had - then definately give this place a try!

This location is by far the worst. They've botched our order every single time we've ordered from here. After the first time, you'd think we'd go somewhere else. We were actually trying to give them a chance. Stale chips Everytime. We're vegan, so we ordered the veggie burrito. Got home, cut it open to find chunks of meat throughout. Now to animal eaters, this would be ok....to me it's absolutely disgusting.

After checking in here today, I read the reviews and I'm really surprised. The nurses at Simon Med were very polite & prompt with getting my son & I in. We were a walk in also. And within 30 minutes we were finished! We got the Xray results same day as well. I'm thinking they have really weeded out the problem nurses, and brought in some new nurses since all of the bad reviews. If not, then they've stepped up their game quite a bit. I'd definitely go back here if in fact there ever is a need to in the future.

The lady that answers the phone is rude. And btw, they no longer accept spay/neuter pet vouchers.

If I could give this place no stars, I would. We came in an hour ago. We were walk-ins, and of course everyone who signed up online to come in has came & went. We're supposed to be next, but that was 45 minutes ago. There are absolutely no real doctors here. They are all physicians assistants. So at best they're supposed to be trained to do standard procedures, give prescriptions & move on. I've never had to wait this long, even at my own Dr's office. I will absolutely never come back to this urgent care again!

Just had this pizza tonight. It's seriously not even close to being good. The ingredients of the pizza taste very cheap as well as the quality. Now I understand why it's so inexpensive. Upgrade your ingredients Jen & maybe charge a bit more for your pies. Little Caesar's taste better than this pizza. And I hate Little Caesar's. So that's how bad this is.
