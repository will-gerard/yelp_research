My husband and I have been here twice - for anniversary celebrations. It truly is a 5 Star experience. My husband has worked in the food and restaurant industry for over 20 years and now compares everything to Kai - which is completely unfair! We have had the short story, as well as various other menu items. Everything is fabulous - presentation, flavor, the attention to detail... Menus are designed by native artists, the table decor, the interior, etc. - all inspired by and/or done by Natives of various tribes.  The service is impeccable - all employees are very knowledgeable & attentive. And the finishing touches (bottled water, a hand-signed note from our attendant & chocolates in the car that was pulled up from valet) was so personal. Kai amplified our anniversary celebrations! We hope to be able to visit again!

Tried this place at the invitation of friends, and am so glad!!! It was delicious!! So much food was brought out on our plates that I wasn't sure how I was going to make a dent in the portion. But it was so good I tried!!! Delicious! It's not a high profile place. Just a place in a plaza ... That is incredible!!

Joe's is a great place! The menu has healthy options, local ingredients, and is very tasty! The history of the building (at one time a house/residence) is cool too. There is indoor and outdoor seating, which is really nice during the cooler months in AZ. The set up is different than many restaurants. It seems to me to be a hybrid of a cafeteria and a restaurant - definitely casual.  Patrons wait in line (snakes around and out the door like an amusement park) to place their order at the window. Laminated menus are provided for perusal while in line. Once the order at the window is placed & paid for, then seats and drinks are next. Seating inside is limited to a side room that seats approx 40-50 and a long pub height table near the line to order. Additional seating is located outside in a "back yard" with shade trees, picnic tables and some tables with chairs. Soda fountains are also located outside.  The ordering and pick up area for the food tends to get congested. There seems to always be a line...which is a testament to the food! It's a local favorite. Family friendly. Healthy and flavorful options. Price range is $10-$15 per person (including beverage). On your birthday bring your ID and they'll give $10 toward your meal for your birthday!! That's always nice, right?  I've enjoyed everything I've ordered here - ever. So despite the congestion I will come back. The quality & consistency make it worth it.

Great place to hang out and converse over coffee, breakfast, or lunch. It's a local favorite so be prepared to wait - to order and to sit, especially on Saturdays. But it's worth it! Healthy options, Midwest/retro feel and outdoor seating. Rose garden, farmers market and room for kids to run outside. The only con is that I don't think the baked goods live up to the hype. Overall one of my favorite places & the San Diegan is as good as the reviews say!!

This place was good. We went on a whim. We were driving by and decided to stop and try it. The Ghosttown was closed, but the steakhouse and saloon was open. The service was friendly. It was not very busy, so weren't sure if that was a good sign. Turns out - it's a good place! The environment is very kitschy - just as you would expect from an old west town. Boots, hats, mounted animals, wagon wheels, lanterns, etc.  The menu is on an old newspaper. There is a limited variety, but something to appeal to most everyone who knowingly visits a Steakhouse and Saloon. The outdoor patio is a great place to host a large party on cool evenings, and the inside has 3 levels of seating. We were there on a live music night which was fun too!  The food was decent. Neither of us ordered steak, but we would be willing to come back and try it!

A friend introduced me to this place by sharing a donut with me a while back. The donut was SO good! I drove 45 minutes to get fresh ones yesterday, and it was worth it! The young lady who helped me with my 2 dozen donuts (wanted to give back to those who had shared with me) was nice and chose a good variety! The shop was busy (a good sign), and there were several varieties to choose from. I ate a Bavarian creme filled with chocolate icing donut right away!! It was delicious. Difficult to describe how a donut can be dense and light at the same time, but it is. It doesn't have the same grease/oil content. It was warm and so tasty!! Not skimpy on the filling either! Worth the drive. Lamar's is so good!

Great italian restaurant. Good service & delicious food! I was in a group of 12 & everyone at the table said their meal was tasty. I ordered lasagna & thoroughly enjoyed it! The chicken parmagiana was a table favorite. Even the burgers were good!

Our first time here. We used a groupon. Everything was superb. My husband is very particular, and he said "The best meal I've had in a while." We had the Steve's shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. They were large in size and very tasty. A wood flavor. Flavorful and good texture. He ordered the rib eye. I ordered the filet tips and lobster tail. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were exactly what they should be - tender, juicy and delicious. The lobster tail was succulent. Probably the best I've had. (I've not been to the east coast.) The salad is good. The bread is brought in from a local bakery - baked fresh every day. Great place! We'll be back!! This will be a special occasion place though, as the prices are a little higher than what we typically pay on a night out. 4 large shrimp = $16. Filet tips and lobster tail = $35. 14 oz Ribeye = $28. The entrees include salad and a side of either fries, sweet potato fries or a baked potato. Bread and butter are also provided. It's a great place, and very enjoyable, we're just typically more frugal - unless we're celebrating a special occasion.

Don't ya hate it when your favorite menu item is removed? (I realize this is a first world problem.) I used to go to Rubio's for their grilled mesquite shrimp burrito. Since they don't have that anymore, I don't have a "Rubio's fav" anymore. No reason to go. A friend of mine chose it as our lunch location the other day & so I went. Tried the current taco special. Can't remember what it was, so it didn't leave an impression. The mesquite grilled shrimp burrito was the only thing I ordered! If I craved it - I knew what I was having for lunch or dinner. No more.  It's been over a year since I've chosen Rubio's. It takes time for me to find a favorite, and I don't want to start over again, especially if there is the risk of it being removed from the menu! So much work thrown aside! Ha! Funny but true.

We love Oregano's! The pasta is good. The portions are good size. And if you're into chicken wings - their wings are meaty and good!  My personal favorite is the Zany Ziti, though I have also ordered the Lady is a Scampi. It's spicy, but also very good.  The service is good. Food is consistently good. And the tshirts are funny!!

Good wings! Good service. Reasonably priced. Love this place! I've been eating at NNY for over 20 years. Started at the Gilbert & Southern location, but have eaten at a variety of locations since. I've introduced others to NNY as well. It's one of our favorite places. My husband and I have tried other wings places (all the other local places that I won't advertise here) and always end up back at NNY. The flavor, service & consistency keep bringing us back!

Simply "Frost"'is a family owned company. It's a local favorite. They let you sample "or try before you buy" so you know you'll like what you order. Always friendly, always delicious. This is a place I bring visitors as no one has had a bad word to say about it. Just a few steps away from a playground for the kids (and a splash pad in warm months) it's a kid- friendly place. Be prepared for a line though on evenings and weekends. It's a great place that the locals frequent!!!

Revolution is my "go to" when I need my floors cleaned. Bill has cleaned our carpet and our tile grout and both showed the results if his quality work. I have asked him back several times for holiday prep & clean up, routine cleaning & upkeep, and will continue to do so as his thorough work is unbeatable. Thank you Revolution!!

Seriously! So satisfied again! The owner (Bill) came on short notice and cleaned up a catastrophe (child vomit in dining room) right before a family celebration! The smell and all other evidence was gone! Thank you for saving the day!!

Entered this small restaurant with high hopes of finding our new wing place. Saw the award posted and the big trophy...which was promising! However the lady at the register did not greet us. She looked right at us and then turned and walked away. She showed something on her phone to the guy at the grill. Hung receipts/orders on the middle island/prep surface. She returned to the register and counter and resumed looking on her phone. No greeting or offer to help.  My husband works in the restaurant business as a manager. He values customer service so much that he refused to spend our money here. We left. Unfortunate really, as he LOVES wings and we eat out a lot! He craves wings at least once a week. This could have been our new wing place. However, due to the lady with the long pink nails, long dark hair in the back and blonde weave in the front - Atl Wings will not receive any of our money. A little training on good customer service could really help this place out.

Love this place! I look forward to sharing it with others! The Crepes were delicious, the popcorn appetizer was fun & the chocolate marshmallow brûlée was the perfect sweet to end the experience. I was treated to the best chai I've ever had - they used Almond Milk. It was smooth, light & delicious! The decor is fun, vintage, lively & cute...the perfect combo. Of the two Crepes we ordered, the Papa K was my favorite. I can't wait to come back & try others!! And someday soon - a sweet crepe!

My husband and I really like this place. It's usually busy (good sign at a restaurant). The burritos and pancakes are big, in fact the portions are big in general. Not Claim Jumpers big, but more than enough. I have yet to finish a meal. There is always a take home container in my hand when we leave.  It's home style foods - things you want a breakfast & lunch place to have. Eggs, pancakes, potatoes, pork (bacon, ham, etc.) We sat at the bar last time we were there and were able to interact with the staff. Most were friendly, helpful, and very nice. The kitchen crew was fast and appeared to work well together.  We have been here several times and will continue to come back, as the food is good and the prices are fair. Some of the servers are excellent!!  Recently found out this is 1 of 4 locations.

This location is closed. The store closed over a year ago. The nearest hallmark is on the NW corner of Rural & Ray.

Looking forward to driving through Gill's Grounds this morning. Gill is a friendly guy with a good work ethic. He's always got a smile, a laugh and a willing heart. Good to know you, Gill!!  The coffee and tea are good enough for me to come back long enough to know that!! Well done!

The new location in Mesa is great! There is a waiting area now INSIDE, a photo "booth" stage with props and some fun interior to set the mood for fun & laughs! Such a huge improvement from their old location! We've enjoyed attending before & brought friends this time! Looking forward to fun!!

I can't rate the food. I can only rate the greeting. The hello was good, but the time estimate was deterring. "It could take anywhere from 20-40 minutes or maybe more for a table to open up based on when people leave from the first game." It doesn't encourage a person to stay. Sounds like seating is possible, but not guaranteed. We didn't wait. Went to one of the other delicious restaurants in the parking lot that was able to give us a wait time, and seated is within that time.  A little more training might be needed for the hostess desk. Uncertainty is not the signal you want to send at the entry.
