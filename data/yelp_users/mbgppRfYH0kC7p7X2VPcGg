If I could give negative stars I would. One of the used car salesman hit me with one of their cars. After being cited by Phoenix PD, he proceeded to lie about who owned the car and what insurance was responsible. Later, after finding out that Auto-Europa actually owned the car and was responsible I tried calling to get insurance information. I spoke with Jason who was rude and dismissive and refused to give me any info so now I have to hire an attorney to file a civil suit. If this salesman Joseph Pratt and the owner/manager Jason are any indication of the type of service and sales it's my duty to warn everyone of their scumbag practices.

Had service for a 2005 KLR 650. Very helpful, professional, and friendly. Standard shop rates, but very knowledgeable. I feel the service manager, Troy, really went out of his way. Wish they could work on my car! Note: they won't work on anything older than 10 years old. The showroom looks quite extensive too with Honda, Kawasaki and Yamaha in stock. Used bikes too.

Pita Jungle on Apache is the kind of place I want to love: art on the walls, specials under $10, good location, a hip vibe, and an eclectic and healthy menu, but due to poor service, mediocre food and other, better restaurants  in the vicinity I can't bring myself to recommend Pita Jungle on Apache whole heartedly if other options are available.  Let me give you a bit of background to better qualify this review: I've been to the Gilbert location for takeout a couple of times and visited this Apache location last Thursday, at 9:30 pm. It was the end of a five day fast and I had just finished a busy day and an exhausting workout, so I decided to treat myself to sit down at Pita Jungle looking forward to a flavorful and healthy experience.  The Good: The Daily Specials this night are about 10 bucks and feature a variety of grilled chicken, tilapia, mahi mahi, hummus, pita and vegetables. The location has an ASU crowd of happy hipsters tucking into their fare with good natured raucous laughter and conversation.  The Bad: Time from seating to water was 15 minutes. Service pace bad. An additional 20 minutes until food arrived. Soup arrived and entree immediately followed. Back server was mute and perfunctory. Request for additional condiments never arrived. After ordering the main server "James" _never_ checked if anything was needed, only to pick up dish and deliver bill. _Never_ asked how things were, just said "All done?". Mahi Mahi was overcooked and there were not enough pita chips for the overly salty hummus.  Summary: If you want to meet up with your hipster friends, or a desperate for a vegetarian option with later hours, try your luck. However I'd recommend the Blue Nile or ever go next door to the Tasty Kabob.

it's a nice, big place with indoor and outdoor seating, but the tacos I had that were 'on special' were bland, small and expensive. Service was a bit thready too, though I was here for an event and there were a lot of people, we had called ahead of time to let them know, but apparently they didn't take us seriously. Probably wouldn't stop by again unless it was the only choice in the area.

This theater features independent and foreign films. The Harkins Loyalty Cup is honored here. It's a small theater, but many times is the only theater featuring the films they offered. Most recently I viewed Joss Whedon's "Much Ado About Nothing" here. I'd visit again anytime.

I love, love, love this store. Other than an actual Farmer's Market I can't find a better deal on fresh produce. The also have an extensive health supplement section.  Staff is _always_ cheerful and helpful, and having this kind of store open until 10 every night ROCKS!  Their specials can be very good and change weekly. For instance, one month they were offering discounts on ALL gluten free foods (well tagged) which was very helpful to someone like me who experiments with my diet. Another week the had 25% off ALL supplements (I went nuts on Udo's and Raw Vitamin products).  Note: They normally offer a monthly flyer and a weekly flyer. On Wednesdays, the previous week AND the current week specials are vaild.  I'm not sure what other people are complaining about regarding prices. I meticulously keep a database of the products I buy, where I buy them and how much they cost. Other than a few bulk items I buy at Costco (and of course Farmer's markets) these are the lowest I've found.  That being said, I can't always find what I want at Farmer's markets, and since I shop for only one, I don't require bulk foods so much.

There are many other reviews which extol the virtues of this location. I just wanted to add some of my experiences as well as a few observations.  First off, at the time of this writing I've been in Phoenix for about a year. Learning about all the necessary places to go in a new town, I had the opportunity to rate businesses objectively (not like 'My mom always went there so I do too...')  Fry's became a standard 'go to' place. Their hours are great (5 AM to 1 AM). There are many locations, and their prices are very competitive. They also have a convenient VIP card and electronic coupon program.  Specifically to my needs, this location has a good pharmacy, an organic/health selection and a well stocked bakery and deli (for parties and special occasions). Their parking is reasonable and the lot is well kept/secure. There's also a Chase branch nearby as well as a Best Buy, Staples and Old Navy. On Wednesdays there's a Farmer's Market just across the street for everything else I can't find here.  Not all Fry's carry the same things. For instance, I can only depend on this location to carry pita bread, garlic naan, large Fage yogurt as well as the Mexican version of creme fraiche. I appreciate this greatly.  One word of caution, be firm with the staff at the deli. Take a number, insist on their attention, and don't let them gyp you with small wings or the bottom of the pasta selection. I know some of them don't care about their job, but don't let that ruin your experience. Remember: they're probably making minimum wage.  Oh, and the other reviewer's comment about the parking is accurate, although I'm not sure what they can do about it as this is a mall complex.

(For those not aware, a chakra is one of the seven centers of spiritual energy in the human body according to yoga philosophy. The fourth chakra is the heart chakra.)  Tucked away in the Town & Country Shopping Center is Chakra 4 Herb & Tea House, a unique establishment that provides herbs, teas, advice, a specialized diet menu (vegetarian, vegan and raw) as well as scheduled events.  The Store: I first found Chakra 4 when searching for teas and herbs on the Internet to accompany my raw food diet. Upon my entrance I was greeted happily by the proprietor and offered immediate assistance. Upon request, advice was given (for they had three versions of the tea I was looking for) further suggestions regarding preparation, and quick checkout. This has been the standard for service whenever I visit the Store  There are _walls_ of herbs and normally two to four staff to assist the many customers. Check out their website to see the depth of their product selection and knowledge.  The Cafe': I have eaten here a few times over the weekend (weekdays they close at 7). The food is excellent, tasty and oh, so good for you. As I said, I have been on a raw food diet and have found plenty to be had on their menu. They also have a separate menu for teas and infusions to address any number of health issues or moods.  The only problem I have with Chakra 4 is the cafe's service. Unlike the store, the cafe' is not as attentive. I have witnessed people confused about the outside seating because when they sit down, no server approaches them. I have also had to come to the counter a couple times to ask for my bill.  You should also check regularly for their hours, as sometimes they close the store for events such as a solstice celebration or cooking classes.

While struggling to maintain balance in my life, a daily practice is helped immensely by a beautiful space, knowledgeable staff and stimulating curriculum.  I've got some experience in yoga, ayurveda and have travelled a bit in Asia. I had the fortune to spend some time in Mysore studying ashtanga, at an ashram in Pune as well as vipassana in Chiang Mai.  In my travels through the States and around the world I have had the fortune to study under amazing teachers in humble rooms and exotic locales. These experiences have made me quite particular in my choice of studios.  Urban Yoga meets or exceeds all my expectations.  It is hard to get over how beautiful it is. One continually notes the nuanced attention: from the door handles to the floors in the locker rooms. But as beauty can be a thin surface, the honest appreciation comes through while coming to class every day: the classes available seven days a week many from 6:30 AM to 8:00 PM. Online scheduling, teacher summaries (and what excellent, passionate teachers!).  My favorite part? The little lending library that reminds me of all the libraries I would see in ex-pat cafes while travelling in India.  Pricing is quite reasonable also. Tip: they seem to offer some kind of package special every month.

The menu has a little something for everyone and the kitchen is amenable to customization. I enjoy the fresh, local ingredients and the seasonal changes.  A nice selection of wines, coupled with organic cocktails and fresh juices are available.  Of course, the biggest draw is Dr. Weil's partnership, although if you've read his books there are some selections counter to his recommendations.  The inside is loud (and dark at night), but there is also outdoor seating that is much calmer.

I rarely give 5 stars. That's perfect or "As good as it gets" as Yelp says. I believe this is the case with Half Price Books on Camelback  Rd.  Let me explain:  I'm an avid reader across a very wide body of topics. I just LOVE to read. I love a good bookstore too. While I go to Borders and shop on Amazon, there's nothing that beats a good discovery at a used book store.  I go to used bookstores wherever I am and Half Price's locations across the country became an early favorite. Clean, well organized with friendly knowledgeable staff and some good finds as well as a healthy selection of popular topics.  While it's not as cheap as it used to be (and not as much bang for your buck on sell backs) I have been noticing some very welcome improvements:  1) They're starting to electronically catalogue their items. They say they'll be able to check other locations' inventory next year.  2) They keep their Information Technology section up to date and well organized. As I said I work in IT and it bugs the crap outta me to see a 10 year old book (may as well be 100 years old with no value).  3) I appreciate their attention to detail in separating 'Raw Food' cookbooks from Vegan and Specialty Diets. This goes the same for the separation of Database books from Data Warehousing and Computer Languages.  4) Great Hours. In fact their hours are more comprehensive than the local Borders.  5) Great content. I'm discovering quality books in sections I never knew, this is something I just can't do online - wander a bookstore.  They do sometimes run outta free coffee. Those b@stards!

As others state this business has shady practices. They're all about the money and have poor customer service. I arrived half and hour early and they were twenty minutes late my first apoointment. Instead of a cleaning the gave me an orthodontic assessment. The second time they didn't answer my call to confirm, was delayed by construction the dentist cancelled because they had to get the airport. Wish I would've read these reviews before: (

If you know me,  then you know that I don't like to wait in line. However a friend highly recommended this place and,  after a 30 minute wait,  I'm glad I did. This has to be THE best BBQ I've had since James Gaspy and BackRiver Bob days. The fatty Brisket melts in your mouth,  the dry smoked ribs were as good as the ones Joe S. used to do and the jalapeño sausage was both crumbly and just spicy enough to be subtly tasty. This is a hole in the wall place with limited parking so carpool. Tip: get there EARLY. They open at 11, but people were in line at 10. They say til 4, but while I was in line they ran out of Rib Tips (and talking with the guy they run out each day -  they're working on getting another smoker). The beans are made from the trimmings so they have a good amount of meat and sausage in them. Highly recommended.

1/22/16 Manager M. Grey dropped a check off with full reimbursement at my place of work. Still can't in good conscience recommend this location but appreciate him taking care of the matter personally and trying to make it right.1/4/16 THEY PUT THE WRONG OIL FILTER IN MY CAR NOV. HAVE NOT REIMBURSED ME. Had my oil changed. 20 miles later smoke and a burning smell freaked me out. Professional mechanic found they had installed the wrong oil filter so oil was spraying all over (the smoke from the cat/exhaust). Was down a couple of quarts. I left many messages at the location's number - NO RESPONSE FROM J. SANTOS. Contacted District Manager Michael Grey. He initially responded but after submitting paperwork for reimbursement to SANTOS  - NO RESPONSE.
