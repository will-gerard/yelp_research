Coffee is ok. The sandwich is mediocre like you can make it at home for $7? I don't think so. I expected more. Their employees don't have uniforms but they are way too sloppy eve looks dirty. On a tank top all sloppy it doesn't look professional. I know it's a coffee shop but it says a lot. I like how they have the different coffee beans decor on the wall. That's pretty cool. Prolly won't come back

I'm very hard at reviews so let me tell you this burger didn't really had much flavor to it I got a bacon cheese burger with guacamole and mushrooms  lettuce tomato and pepper jack cheese it had a lot of cheese but nothing really had flavor it lacked of flavor and the fries I got were a bit soggy and they were somewhat too salty to eat alone. I got small fries and a coke I uploaded a pic of the burger! Check it out oh and the customer service was decent I mean I was in drive thru so not much to say

This gym has lots of potential because it has so many equipment and different things to do like racquet ball basketball it's got a full sauna steam room pool and jacuzzi. New equipment has been remodeled. Classes throughout the week. I wish they had more classes available and not just in the morning .staff is friendly

Ever since they remanaged this place . It has been great servers have good customer service and the food is pretty good. The noise level is above average . But they have no control over that really.

Food was bland and cold. Coffee was decaf . Mest up the orders, staff wasn't attentive.

Decor was great very modern and classic but fancy. Their service was great and the food was delicious. They have a small menu that they can perfect each dish which is good. Me and my bf got the rotisserie chicken and beef rib combo with came with 2 sides and was 27$ each. We also got a Caesar salad that was really good as well. By far one of the best Caesars I've had $8 I think it's pricier than other restaurants but it has more to offer and the service and food make up for it . Therefore it's so worth it

So this place is nice I got the Cubano coffee, the only down side was how clean it was they should look at little details like cleaning the glass tables often and the outdoor trash

I'm very tough in grading just because I know quality and I know how my food should taste, fries are mushy not the best and the food in general doesn't look as appetizing as it does in the pictures way far from it, it barely had any lettuce the cheese isn't melted ? I mean I would prolly give it another chance with  another meal

Place was clean and good the food was pretty good. Orange juice was really good fresh squeezed. Cucumber flavored water. I got bacon eggs and hash browns with. Pancakes the pancakes weren't my favorite they tasted like from the box but okay. The orange juice was my fav. Waitress was nice . They took long to notice me at the bar cause I was alone. It took around 4 for them to even say hello. Which is why I gave a 4 hospitality is very important for this type of restaurant. . I would come back they have interesting items on their menu.

Love their food. Everything comes out quick . Most employees are friendly. Food is fresh . It's a good place for lunch and they have lunch specials Monday through Friday from 11-4pm . From $6 includes entree and a starter! Can't beat it . Wish they had an option for a Caesar salad but they don't . I recommend the bacon avocado chicken sandwich . Only thing I found odd was serving salad on a warm plate? Lol
