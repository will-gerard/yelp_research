Many years ago, about 8-9 years ago? (jeeze), when I was in high school, my friends and I would pass this place and joke about going there. "On that's the place that will send you to the hospital across the street hahaha" kind of stuff.  Then one day, my friend Kyle braved the dares and decided to eat here. And he came every day for a month. So I decided to meet his challenge and try it. I ordered their California burrito for 5 dollars and received a burrito that changed my life. I've been a faithful burrito shack customer ever since.   The aesthetic of this place isn't much, but it isn't trying to be. They don't have ac, they have water bags to keep flys out. But who cares, the food is awesome. I, and my friends, have since moved away from AZ. Any time we are back we hit up the burrito shack. I took all my groomsmen here after my wedding for a thank you burrito. My best friend asked me to be in his wedding here. I've discussed the most important things here like life, the future, marriage, and the every day stuff like tv and video games. What does this have to do with a restaurant? Well that's just what burrito shack is. It's more than good food, it's a quirky place where you make memories with friends that last a life time.

I generally shop here for MTG supplies and miscellaneous DnD supplies, mostly dice. The staff has always been very nice and helpful. They will always give me a rundown on the deals they have going on. I called a bit ago see of they had booster box for M14 and they put one to the side for me with a free rare. My only real complaint is their pricing. They sell boxes for $105 and boosters for $3.99. This seems like standard pricing to me, but the store I used to shop at before moving to AZ sold their MTG items at a pretty high discount, though I suspect they were doing some shady business. All and all this is the store I will take my business too and recommend other people do as well.

I had a coupon for a free oil change. I took my car in and the guy at the front, I think the boss, was a real nice and professional guy. He got me set up and my car back really quick. After 10 minutes or so the mechanic told me that they have to charge me 55 dollars to do the service because my car uses a different more expensive oil. This is surprising because when I've changed it I've never had to spend more than 30 dollars. He finally lowers the price to 45 and I needed it done so I agree. Come to find out they had already drained my oil before I agreed to pay for the service. But, when it's all said and done I was talking to the boss, he explains that he buys his oil from the local dealers at 12 per quart. I said that at O'Rileys it costs like 5.30 for a quart. So either you are paying way too much for oil or just trying to make a quick buck. Either way, they are nice people, but not a place to go to for a service.

This place is great. I've had a bunch of different menu items and each one is worth reordering. The garlic fries are great. In the winter time they have really pretty out door seating, there are nice areas to sit around, and a large tree for kids to climb. There isn't anything too faulty about this place but nothing that merits a 5 start rating. But it's one of those unique spots the are great for out of towners, and it never hurts to mention it was on TV.

They have Chicago style deep dish pizza and garlic bread that is at least three feet long. How can you go wrong?

I used to eat here a lot when I lived in AZ. It was a great place. Good Greek food. I almost always got the Spartan club. Which was a huge sandwich with chicken, gyro meat, tomato, and other great stuff. It was a nice alternative to some of the surrounding greasy and heavy food.

A few years ago, I would have given this location a 5 star review but it has gone downhill since then. They used to give discounts if you only got a few things in your burrito. They have continually raised prices while giving smaller portions. I'm pretty sure they use smaller spoons. And I get that they are a corporation and that the decisions aren't always up to them, but there is no denying the value has gone down hill. It's still good food, but not worth 9  dollars a person.

Went during lunch hour and they had some good lunch specials for 8 dollars. I had an excellent chicken panini and a salad for a good price. The food came quick and was filling. I look forward to going back.
