Frequent Los/Papa Chevos customer. Somebody fudged up the last batch of green sauce at this location. Was basically green vinegar water with little/no taste. Fix the green sauce please :)

Best greek food in Chandler. My favorite dishes include the specialty hummus, chicken shwarma pitta w/ greek fries, and the lamb platter. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though!

I came to the bar and asked for the Imperial Double IPA. The bartender then said to me, "okay."
