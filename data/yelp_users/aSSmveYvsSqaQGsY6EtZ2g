VERY COOL ITALIAN/JAPANESE FUSION SPOT!  I discovered this place because it is one of the few restaurants in the area that serves Ramen. If you're a foody like me, you know what I'm talking about when I say, "Ramen" and not  that BS generic top ramen shit... But yes they serve it here! =)  The Ramen was pretty good, not as good as Japan or in my hometown Bay Area, CA but it was good!   I enjoyed this restaurant because it's probably the only place I've ever been to that specializes in both Japanese and Italian cuisine.  THEY HAVE A AWESOME HAPPY HOUR MENU which literally cut the price of some menu items in half! =)   MUST TRY AND RECOMMEND!!

Tried PPP for the first time, they messed up my order in a few different ways  1st  They called me back because they forgot what level of spiciness I wanted for my wings.  2nd They forgot my salad  3rd I ordered half combination half cheese and they gave me half pepperoni half cheese   All the staff were very nice and friendly though. They compensated us with a free medium pizza, which we were really thankful for but we still would have rather not gone through the head ache...  THE BATHROOM WAS MORE FILTHY MILEY CYRUS AT THE VMA's!!! ALL STALLS LITERALLY  HAD SHIT OVER FLOWING, AND THE ONE URINAL and ONE GARBAGE CAN WAS OVERFLOWING AS WELL... employees and managers should definitely pay more attention to that!  The location was big but did not have that many games to play with so I'm still a little confused of the target market for the establishment. Pizza was ok...

NICEST 24HR SPORT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!  I have the all sport membership and I've been to multiple 24hr Sports gyms in San Diego and the Bay Area, and this is the best one by far! I found out it was supposed to be a super sport (meaning a higher level of membership) but they made it into a regular club sport instead. So you're quite lucky if you just have a regular membership and decide to go here.  GRRRRRRREAT FOR GYM JUNKIES!!!  Even though this review is being written right after New Years and everyone decides to get fit and healthy as a New Year Resolution, I still don't have a problem utilizing the machines and benches I want.   ONE thing that I am all so very THANKFUL for is something that I always encounter at gyms and NOT have yet here. THERE ARE NO CREEPY OLD GUY DRYING THEIR BALLS in the HAND DRYER!! YAYYYYYYYY!!! (hoping it stays that way!)  KUDOS!! To the gym manager for replying to the other reviews here and trying to resolve the issues mentioned.. That's a  definite rarity, so here's what I think hinders you from a perfect 5 star rating...  #1- I told one of your employees that 3 of the stair masters were not working. (I spent 5 minutes out of my work out discovering this, and I decided to be a good gym junkie comrade and report this so others wouldn't waste 5 minutes as well.) but your employee did nothing. I believe policy is to put a out of order sign, yeah?  #2- insufficient amount of paper towel machines and cleaning bottles. I think I only saw 4? They should be easily accessible for people like me who like to make MY MUSCLES CRY SWEAT and like to be CONSIDERATE TO MY FELLOW GYM JUNKIES by cleaning after myself.  #3- I'm not trying to be vain, but you need more mirrors sir! We need to be able to check our form and see our sexy progress happening!  OVERALL FOUR STARS, AND THIS IS MY DEFAULT GYM... RECOMMEND!!

DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF SNACKS!!  stumbled onto this place looking for the chick-fil-a (there's apparently not one in the mall any longer) and the couldn't resist the tasty looking pictures! So even though we were not craving Mexican, we were easily convinced...   ***DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURES!!!***  Even though the cashier was very nice and friendly, almost everything went wrong with our order... My wifey and I wanted "Tortas" because the picture looked most appealing... She asked if they used guacamole or avocado and the cashier said they were actually out of both,  so she changed her mind to two tostadas (also looking very appealing) one chicken, one steak. I ordered the steak torta combo... simple order? right....? HOW COULD YOU MESS THAT UP???  FORGOT:   1. Beans on the tostadas...  2. One chicken tostada, we got two beef 3. My combo, I had to wait for my fries and soda to be prepared  TASTE COMPLAINTS:  1. Steak was rough, chewy, and unseasoned 2. Fries were unseasoned, and salt and pepper was not available 3. We tasked for a water cup, she accidentally put coke in it, pored the coke out and gave us water with out even rinsing the cup... ewwwww!  I saw that other customers ordered snacks like fruit and chips that looked very appealing, but I will definitely not order a entree from here again!

FINALLY!! A REALLY GOOD **CLEAN** PHO SPOT!!!  I just moved to the area for the Cal-E-Fo-Nay-Yay and in the three months I've been here I've been in pursuit of a default Pho restaraunt. On the verge of giving up of what seemed to be a figment of my imagination, I found this place.... YAY!!!  The PHO was FANTASTIC! It came in a smaller bowl I was accustomed to but it was a optical illusion because it was a quite satisfactory amount.  The ambiance was more modern and clean. (Kind of reminded me of a quan nhau... hmmmm now I wonder... lol)   Their primary server is a young bilingual latina, which I think is genius!!! I don't have to be confused if I'm ordering a orange juice or a manicure... But they of course they also have the traditional Vietnamese servers if that's your cup of tea who are also really nice and helpful.   I'M SO GLAD FOUND THIS SPOT! AND IT'S NOW MY GO TO DEFAULT PHO PLACE!   =)  NOOB TUTORIAL:  it's pronounced "FUH" not "FOE"
