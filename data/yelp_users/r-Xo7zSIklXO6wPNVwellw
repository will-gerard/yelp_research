We just walked in and then walked right out! The employee that was working was coughing and sniffing and snorting all over the food!!

I was nervous given the previous reviews but it was the closest Subway to our baseball tournament so we decided to give it a try. We were very pleased with our service. We came in with about 12 people and they brought out extra help which kept everything running smooth & efficient. The ladies behind the counter were all very nice as well.

We ordered a To-Go meal:   Where do I start: first- they didn't give us breadsticks! How do you forget the breadsticks in an Olive Garden dinner? They are the staple.  But more importantly was the service and the quality of the food. Let's start with the service: I placed our order online. I ordered the Chicken Marsala but I hate the seasoned potatoes that comes with it, the flavor of the shriveled potatoes with the Marsala sauce is not a good combination in my opinion. I would prefer to swap them out with some pasta, but I didn't have that option. I had the option of switching it out for Mashed potatoes & broccoli. Fine, not my preference but still better than the repulsive cubed potatoes. I was surprised to see that the total for my 2 main dishes and 1 kids meal was over $40, but I was hopeful. I sent my daughter to pick up our meal. When she got there she was told "um, your meal doesn't come with mashed potatoes and we are out of broccoli - so I don't know what you're going to do about that." Apparently no one in the kitchen is capable of swapping out the potatoes. Please note that she was told this as she was being handed the bag to leave. We didn't get a call or any warning. Now onto the quality of the food: like I had mentioned earlier, I had ordered the chicken Marsala. I was disgusted by the Marsala "jelly" that was slopped on my chicken "patty" and smushed into my seasoned potatoes (that I tried to not have mix in with my meal). The chicken breasts were rubbery and tasted like it might be able to double as a nugget somewhere else. In all honesty, it tasted very similar to the chicken Marsala weight watchers frozen dinner. Except that one would have only cost me $3.00.  It had been a while since I had been to an Olive Garden because I felt that the menu got really boring a few years ago (remember those cheese filled crepe's that were folded into little squares and then saut√©ed and served with chicken tenders- those were heaven! After those left the menu so did everything else that was appealing) but my daughter wanted some Italian so I obliged her request. Never again. Thankfully they are not the only option.

I just waited in the drive-thru line for over 30 minutes. When I pulled up there were only 3 cars ahead of me so I didn't think for a second that we would be in line any longer than 10 minutes - max. After about 15 minutes it was finally my turn to order at the speaker. I sat there for 6 minutes. No one said "hello, I'll be with you in a minute" or anything! I even said "hello? Is anyone there?" Thinking that maybe the speaker was broken, with no sign, I decided to drive around (I felt like that could be a good indication as to why it was taking so long). Then I sat behind another car for at least 10 more minutes. (At this point I was contemplating jumping the curb and destroying the shrubbery and finding the nearest Circle K.) When I got up to the window she looked at the register and asked me if it was my order, which is wasn't... So I told her I didn't think their speaker was working (I am giving 1 star here because she was very sweet and apologetic) so she took my order and went to get it. While she was gone I was noticing that the floor was disgusting! There was trash and food all over. Donuts that had been stepped on and walked through on the floor! It was disgusting. There was a girl working the inside counter that looked like she was being held hostage. She was visibly rolling her eyes and moving at an insanely slow pace! It was just all over a frustrating experience. I can get a strawberry frosted donut at 10 other places! Why would I want to ever do this again!?! I am giving the second star because my 7 year old did enjoy her donut!

Holy cow! This pizza was AWESOME! I am so excited that I have finally found a pizza place to call home! I can't wait to go back! I'm dying to try the calzones or pasta or the salad bar!   We picked up a pizza and I was so thankful for the little play area complete with baby dolls for my little girl! The wait was so easy since she was having a blast (and not asking for quarters for the video games!) and it took all of about 12 minutes anyway!

Staff is always friendly and so we keep returning but I'm not sure if it is just my luck, or this locations policy but the "hot & ready" slogan doesn't really apply here. Every time, when it's busy or not busy, I will order our pizza, the cashier calls out my order and they then put the pizzas into the oven. They cook quick, in like 5-6 minutes, but I wouldn't consider this "READY" it's more like "ready to cook". When it's busy, the wait can get pretty frustrating. Especially with only a few chairs to sit on.
