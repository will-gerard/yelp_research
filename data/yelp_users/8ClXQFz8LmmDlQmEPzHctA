I've been to Switch several times - I keep going back because of the consistently good service! The menu offers a variety of yummy choices for lunch or dinner; I have yet to try something there I didn't like.  And if you are looking for a great weekend brunch head to Switch.

My first visit to Hanny's was for a late dinner on a Saturday night. The martini's were amazing and the food was awesome, but I can only give it 2 stars because the service was horrible. It took forever just to get the watier to our table the first time, then he forgot about us after our drink order and I had to track him down so we could order dinner.  Food was great, service sucked.

I enjoyed my first visit to Bliss ReBar! The food was great and reasonably priced... the wine selection was impressive and I liked the environment they've created there. Go check them out!

I love this place! The food is good, atmosphere is awesome and service is friendly. The very large outdoor patio make this the perfect downtown hangout for happy hour or dinner. Try one of the sandwiches that have the pretzel buns: NOM NOM!
