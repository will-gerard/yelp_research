Dr. Salyer was my doctor and he was great!  He took the time to explain why I was having shoulder problems.  I had x-rays and the x-ray techs were nice and friendly.  I had two cortisone injections and it fixed me right up.  I would recommend Dr. Salyer for anyone looking for a good orthopedic doctor.

Burgers, wings, pizza, fries with cheese.....all DELICIOUS !  The variety and customer service is outstanding.  Everything I have had there is like heaven when it touches my lips.  One of my favorite places to eat in the valley.

What a great greasy spoon.  If sliders are what you are craving this place will satisfy your cravings.  Chili cheese fries were really good too.  I would have given it five stars but service was a tad bit slow.  Really good food and overall staff friendliness

Nasty!  I don't know how people eat here. I ordered the green chile burger and it was tasteless!  How can green chile have no flavor??  None...not even a hint of green chile flavor.  The hamburger itself was gray, tasteless.  The only thing good on the burger was the cheese and it wasn't even melted.  I don't know how they are still in business because it was disgusting.  I would never eat here again.  Not even if I was starving.

Best buffet I have ever eaten at.  The food is fresh not over cooked or nasty tasting from sitting so long.  I love that they make their sushi fresh, not that pre made garbage sushi that most buffets have.  I do think dinner is a little expensive at $16 but I have to say their food is not just your run of the mill nasty buffet.  They have awesome service and it smells nice in there.  I love Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet!

Holy giant portions!  My boyfriend and I split a plate and were still stuffed.  I ordered the combo plate #1 which came with Rolled cheese enchilada, tamale, relleno, taco,  Hatch Valley chile con carne smothered with your choice of chile.  I am a wimp so I did not choose the hot chile.  Really good, except the taco...this was totally a ground beef taco...yucky...but the rest of the food on the plate made up for that taco.  They do charge 2.95 for sharing but it is worth it because I don't see how anyone could finish a plate on their own.  They have such an assortment of flavors with their chips and salsa.  It comes with bean dip, green salsa, red salsa and a ranch type of dip.  All were quite tasty.  The best part is that the meal comes with sopapillas!  YUMMY.  They were delish.  They just need to get rid of that ground beef taco and replace that with some good ol shredded beef, that was the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars.

Ned's is such a great little sub shop.  I have been going to Neds for years.  It is a drive for me but their subs are worth it.  It isn't expensive at all and the staff is so nice.  Ned's is GREAT

Fresh, fantastic deli and market.  Their sandwiches are to die for.  I really like their fettuccine alfredo as well.  They are a little slow and the line is always really long so be patient when you go there.

This is probably the worst dry cleaner I have ever been to.  I took two of my comforters there to get cleaned, one was just a little cheap comforter from Target and the other was a very expensive goose down comforter.  When I went to pick them up they only had the cheap target one and told me that they accidentally gave the goose down comforter to someone else.  They said they called that customer but they haven't returned the comforter or their calls.  This has been going on for 3 weeks now and I still don't have my goose down comforter.  DO NOT GO HERE!!  I am going to have to take further action.  The goose down comforter was $500.  This is absolutely ridiculous !

Man.  I don't know why I keep going back here for waxing or nails.  I keep trying to give them a chance and they honestly just suck!  I took my daughter to get her nails done here and not even 20 min later they were starting to come off.  I went back about 2 weeks after this to wax my eyebrows and mustache and they totally jacked my eye brows.  I looked like they had been singed off.  Yesterday I took my daughter there to get her mustache waxed and I figured, hey can't mess that up right?  They ended up waxing her eyebrows instead of her mustache.  She said she told them 3 times not her eye brows but the lady didn't understand English and did them anyways.  My daughter is very upset.  I will not go to this place anymore.  The people are nice but they need to get with the program!

Horrible.  We live in the neighborhood and decided to stop in based on the reviews.  We sat down at a booth...and waited, and waited and waited...20 min went by and no one came to take our order.  We finally went up to the bar...waited another 10 min before we were acknowledged...we ordered a pitcher of beer, 15 wings (their special monday night is to order 10 wings and get 5 free) and potato skins.  I saw the cook only had one order in front of ours and one that came in after ours so I figured it would be rather quick.  45 min later he yelled across the bar that our food was ready.  The cook, the two bartenders stood around and talked for a good 20 min before cooking.  This is honestly the worst service I have ever had.  I will not be back.

What a great little establishment!  My daughter and I stumbled upon this little gem a few days ago and not only is their food fresh and great tasting but they have excellent customer service.  The first day I had the croissant filled with boston cream and my daughter had the cheese danish....delish....the second day I split a savory croissant of ham and swiss with my daughter and it was even more delish.  I also had an iced mocha that was perfectly flavored.  I highly recommend this little spot.

I have only had the fish tacos and the ceviche tostadas and they are delish.  I eat here at least once a week and bring the whole family.  Service is always great and their salsa is quite tasty.  I love this place.  I would like to venture out and try the molcajete.  It looks like a lava of cheese.  My food is always great.  My picky kids even love this place.  The fish tacos are my kids favorite.  I think this place is great.  Don't let the fact that it is in Guadalupe scare you!

My favorite Mexican food hands down.  I love Popo's so much I literally crave it once a week.  The portions are so huge that you can eat Popo's twice in a row.  I have had pretty much everything on their menu with the exception of their salads and fajitas.  My favorite is a toss up between the pollo especial and the shredded beef tacos.  The Spanish rice is the BEST I have EVER had....don't tell my Nana I said that!  The customer service is outstanding.  I don't know of any Mexican food restaurant that can top Popo's.  The only negative is that it is ALWAYS packed!

I had the southwest turkey sandwich which had Turkey, sweet roasted red peppers, southwest sauce and pepper jack cheese. Topped with mixed greens and avocado....it was soooooooo good.  I couldn't eat all of it...very filling.  The waffle fries were really good, well seasoned.  Next time I will have to have a beer!

Now this place is sooooooooo good.  The flavor, the meat, the quality of the bread is so fresh and soft, the fries cooked perfectly and that fry sauce is pure heaven.  Really good service as well.  I don't think there is a better cheesesteak in the valley.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is really expensive.  I think it was $14 or $15 for a cheesesteak and fries and a drink. If I were to bring my family here it would be about $60 bucks for a family of four....not ideal for cheesesteaks.  Other than that it was really really yum

Such great customer service!! Not to mention the food was fresh, fast and inexpensive for a seafood place.  I had the fisherman's sampler, torritos and chipoltle shrimp and man there was enough food for any army.  The place was packed and I still managed to eat and pay in under an hour.  Five stars in my book!

pretty good breakfast spot!  I tried something that was new to their menu and it was chicken and waffles in chorizo gravy served with an egg.  It was filling and delicious.  Customer service was great.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there was a fly that kept bugging me but I guess they can't really control that.  Very good breakfast!

These cupcakes are delicious, although pretty expensive for the size and expensive for a cupcake in general.  I have virtually had all of their flavors and every cupcake I have had was really good.  I like the decor and I have always been greeted with a friendly staff.  I would like to try them out for a birthday cake some time.  My cupcakes have never been dry, always fresh and they have the best icing ever.

What is going on with the service in this place??!  You can have good food but if your service is lacking no one will eat there!!!!    I drove to Lobby's about three to four weeks ago now, on a Sunday, I looked up their hours which are listed on their website AND on their door as Sunday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. My family and I arrived at 6 pm.  All the lights were off but there was a girl at the register.  We walked in and she said WE ARE CLOSED.  We tried to see if there was a reason the door and website said that they should be open but she wasn't having any part of our conversation.  We chalked it up to a bad night and returned again a week later on a Friday evening, which their hours are listed as Monday to Friday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  We arrived at 7:15 to the same scene of lights off but a person at the register.  It was the same girl as last time so we didn't even bother walking in this time because she was so rude last time.   I emailed them through their website asking what was going on and I have yet to receive a reply.  Who runs a business like this???  It is really unfortunate because each time we went to Lobby's we would take a friend or two so they can see how delish their food is only to be greeted by rude employees and closed doors!  I don't know if I will be back or recommend this place anymore.  Like I said you can have good food but if your service isn't up to par no one will go there!  I had slow service the last time I was actually able to eat there.  There are way too many good burger joints out there to choose from to put up with this. I am sorry but they have dropped the ball.  I will not be back.

I have been coming to this place for two years and I can't believe that I am just now writing a review.  Every time I come I am greeted with a smile.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The food is fresh and healthy.  Super inexpensive.  My favorite is the lemon rice soup. I also love their gyros, full of flavor.  The stuffed grape leaves are to die for.  The food is filling.  They deliver and are open late.

What an awesome urgent care experience!  Upon my arrival with my daughter who had injured her wrist during volleyball practice they told me that the wait would be about an hour and a half.  This is typical for an urgent care so I was prepared for this...  Well, upon my check in I was greeted with a smile from the girl behind the front desk.  She took my insurance information and paper work and was very pleasant and helpful.  We ended up being called back after about a 40 min wait.  The x-ray technician was a nice young man.  He was helpful and made my 13 year old daughter feel very comfortable.  He had GREAT patient care skills.  We were then called to wait in a room and everything was clean, nice, current and up to date.  We were then seen by a Nurse Practitioner by the name of Jan.  She as so nice and very descriptive in her explanation of the fracture my daughter had.  She came back with a splint and sling for her and I was even able to get her pain medication all in that one facility.    The entire experience only took a little over an hour and I have to say I was very pleased with the staff and facility.  I am not sure why this place received bad reviews but I was happy.  Two thumbs up from this mom!

Good, food, great service.  I had the yellow curry chicken, hot.  It was the lunch special and it came with a soup and spring roll.  Very delish.  I also tried the Thai Coffee and it is probably the best coffee I have ever had.  I have been to the Tasty Thai probably 10 times now and have not been disappointed.

Absolutely FAN FREAKING TASTIC!   I love this store.  They have the most unique items I have ever seen.  Even my 13 year old daughter is in love with this place.  They have so much to choose from and many different sizes.  I love that they feature local artists.  They are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable of their products.  This is a great local business.  I buy all my Christmas gifts here and own several of their unique purses and wallets.

Gross Gross Gross  This is probably the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten.  My fiancee and I ordered the nachos and they were a greasy mess with hardly any cheese on them.  It looked like there was zero effort when it came to making these.  I ordered the chicken chimichanga dinner and it was GROSS.  The chicken tasted like it was a week old.  I spit it out.  The chimichanga was drenched in grease as well.  I understand it is a fried item but your plate should not be swimming in oil.  BARF.  I would never eat here or recommend this place to anyone.

This place is bomb.com!  So good and so many varieties.  I never thought a burger with peanut butter and jelly would be a good thing but it is absolutely delish!  Great service as well.  It is always packed so there is sometimes a little wait but nothing too crazy.  The spicy Mac and cheese burger is to die for....best, creamy, cheesey mac and cheese I have ever eaten.

What a fantastic place!  My fiancee, daughter and I decided to try Rita's this Sat since we have driven by it at least 100 times.  I am so glad we did.  The decor is cute and inviting and the young man behind the counter was so helpful and nice.  We had a million questions for the young man and he answered every question we had with a smile.  I had the gelati, mango and vanilla, my daughter had the blendini and my fiancee had the misto, Swedish fish flavor.  OMG I already want some more Rita's.  I love the variety of choice you have.  It is vast but not overwhelming.  I love this place.

My food was great.  I ordred the Pu Pu platter and the Chicken Lo Mein lunch special.  The chicken in my main dish was tender, not rubbery and so full of flavor.  The portions were big.  I was very happy with my food.  The server did tell me that shrimp were out of season and the shrimp in the pu pu platter might taste kind of river-like and he was right, they were gross.  Other than that it was great.  I would have given them five stars had it not been for the river tasting shrimp but hey, he did warn me and I have to say the customer service was great.  The place was clean.  I would go back for sure.

I have been coming to western dental for three years and now my children are patients.  Their staff is stellar.  From the front office staff to the assistants and dentists I have had nothing but a great experience here. I love their easy payment plans and flexible hours.  More importantly I love their quality of work.  I have had root canals,  crowns and fillings and each experience was great.  I hate the dentist but I love western dental.

I had a GREAT experience!  It was my 12 year old daughter's first time eating Indian food so I asked the server what she recommended for a 12 year old eating Indian food for the first time and she was VERY helpful.  We ended up ordered Samosas, Tandoori Chicken Makhni and Palak Paneer and a side order of Nan.  The food was excellent and I couldn't have asked for better service.  The gentleman who seated us made sure we had fresh rice for our left overs and brought over some foil for our bread.  Our tea glasses never went empty.  I was very very very happy with my service and food.  I would be back again!

Awful food and service!  I always try a place twice before I write a review so I gave this place two chances and it is an unorganized mess.  It took 38 min to get the wrong sandwich TWICE.  There were two girls making the sandwiches and handing them to the poor girl at the register who clearly was a newbie.  They would hand her the sandwiches and say here....when she would ask what they were they would look annoyed and roll their eyes.  The poor girl was just trying to make sure the right order went out the the right people.  Also for this being a bakery why was my bread nasty and stale both times??? Super gross.  My bread tasted like it was a week old.  The first time I had the Turkey avocado sandwich which was BATHED in mayo.  The second time I had the club which had mayo all over the outside of the sandwich in globs and the bacon appeared to be semi-raw.....not thanks....do not recommend this place.

I love Corona.  The staff and teachers are top notch.  They really care about the kids.  My son is a freshman and is in band.  He is excelling in school and the music program is fantastic.  There is great communication between the teachers and parents.  I couldn't be happier with my choice to send my son to Corona.

I had heard about Legends on 98 KUPD and was really excited for them to work on my car, especially because of the reviews here on yelp.  I have to say my experience with Legends was dismal.  I ran over something on the freeway causing the side of my car to have some major paint damage.  I got an assessment through Geico and choose to have my work done at Legends since it was "home of the wave your deductible".    First of all the home of the wave your deductible is misleading.  I took that as, they completely wave your deductible but when I arrived I was informed that depending on the amount of work done on your car that they give you a discount towards your deductible.  Which is great but they should not say it is "home of the wave your deductible" because it isn't.    Next my car was there for FOUR weeks.  Each week I had to call and check the status to see when it was going to be ready.  No one informed me of the status and as a customer an expected ready time would be nice to know esp. because I was in a rental car through Geico.  The one thing that I did like about Legends is that they did inform me that my vehicle had been in a previous accident and the work done by the previous collision center was not up to par.  So I was finally able to pick up my car after actually more than 30 days of being at their facility.  I just wanted my car back at that point.    When I got my car back I also realized that my windshield had also not been fixed and there was still a huge crack.  At that point I called Legends and they said the insurance company was supposed to have had someone come fix it because I have windshield coverage.  I then called Geico and they told me that this was incorrect, that they had already paid Legends to fix the windshield.  After 4 days of back and forth with Legends my insurance company finally just sent out another entity to come repair my windshield.    Upon further notice they left all kinds of wax or some sort of white thick substance all over the bottom and edges of the car which I blew off but now I discovered that my rear light was not attached properly and is falling out.  I don't think I would take my vehicle back there or recommend them to anyone else.  Now I have to call them today to try to get this fixed and since I work from 8-5 pm I can already see this is going to be a hassle or I am going to have to give up a Sat to deal with this.  Save yourself the headache and do not go to Legends, don't believe everything you hear on the radio.  I was really disappointed.

This is my second year renting from Desert Valley Realty Investments and Property Management and I couldn't be happier.  I have had nightmare experiences with past property management companies but Orlando Bertolo and his staff are friendly, professional and take care of any issues that I have had right away.  I would definitely recommend  Desert Valley Realty for anyone who is looking to purchase or rent a home.

What amazing customer service and GREAT job cleaning my carpets.  They email confirmation and what to expect which I really like.  My technician was Abraham and he took his time and was careful, professional and friendly.  Best carpet cleaning service I have ever received and I am pretty picky when it comes to carpet cleaning.  My house smells fresh and clean and they got all the stains and pet odors out.  Thank you Next Level!

Awesome pizza, fantastic wings and OMG the baked fries are DELISH.  I haven't tried the cheesesteaks but I have had pretty much all of their baked fries.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because each time I go I have to wait forever for my food even if there is no one else in the restaurant.

I hate giving this place two stars because the waitress was really awesome, the restaurant was very clean and festive but the food was not good at all.  My family and I decided to try this place for their happy hour.    I ordered the grilled jalapenos which is described on their menu as  grilled jalapenos stuffed with a blend of Monterrey and jack cheese, wrapped in bacon and finished with a cilantro dressing.....sounds good right?......what I actually got were six sorry excuses for jalapenos, burned at the bottom, seeds NOT removed with sprinkled cheese and bacon bits!  Not wrapped in bacon and because of the seeds they were so hot you could not eat them.  The next item I ordered was Juana's combo platter.  This came with a tamale, 2 mini chicken chimi's, 2 taquitos, a mini quesadilla and guacamole.  Sadly my tamale was cold in the middle.  It had a green olive in it that was somewhat frozen....yuck.  The other items were good.  The third and final item was their South of the Border nachos....you could tell they had made this item first because the cheese was congealed so that when you went to lift a nacho, you could lift the entire plate.  Once we peeled off the "shield of cheese" the center was total mush, as it had been sitting there for a while.  the only chips that were crispy were the ones around the edges.  I was really sad that my family and I did not like the food because our area needs a really good mexican food place.  They do have really good salsa but their chips were store bought, as in I think it was a bag of tostidos rounds and tostidos regular chips mixed together.    So if you want terrible food with great customer service you can go to la casa de juana.

I had a California protein Cobb and mmmmm mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmm was this good.  I also had the lobster bisque which was superb.  That is the best lobster bisque ever.  You actually get chunks of lobster in your soup not little tiny bits of lobster.  Perfectly flavored.  Easy to order.  Quick and great service.  The cookie I had with my meal was crave-able.  I could eat lunch here every day.
