Great food every time we eat @ this place. The customers service is also great. This place is always busy but it worth the wait. The street taco are the bomb.

The great food but the service was bad. First we didn't get our drinks until I was done with my appetizer and we had to ask for them. Second the second appetizer (sweet potato fries) didn't even come out until we were done with the main food and we had to ask about them too.   The one stars is for the service  I would give 5 stars for the food
