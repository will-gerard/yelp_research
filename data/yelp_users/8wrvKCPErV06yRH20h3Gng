There aren't words... Just go. Like... Stop what you're doing and get here. Get chicken or burgers or pork fries... WHO CARES?! It's all so f*ing good!!!!

The meat and cheese board is out of this world, and a great way to start the meal. Layer on top-notch pizza after that, and there are few places that compare!

I had high hopes walking into the place because of the ambiance! It's really well laid out and everything looks great. I was anxious to sample the product and they had my FAVORITE - an iced toddy! However after my fianc√© and I paid $10+ for just two drinks I took my first sip in the car... Iced toddys are cold brewed and supposed to remove all the bitterness an acidity of the coffee... But this tasted like they ADDED bitterness! Truly awful and the worst I've ever had. A huge let down :( I give 2 stars purely based on the look and location of the place.

I am a burger fanatic, and I'd put these $6-$7 burgers up against the best in Phoenix. The fries and homemade chips are amazing too!

My car speakers were popping and no sound was coming out of any of them... After talking to a few guys, the electrician grabbed my keys to take a look. 10 minutes later, he handed them to me and said I was good to go! Apparently a few wires came loose in the rear passenger speakers. He plugged them in and secured them - free of charge!

All 3 courses were delicious! Staff was friendly. Atmosphere is a little confusing... Italian/sports bar and grill?
