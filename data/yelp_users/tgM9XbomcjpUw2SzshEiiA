You can't ask for a better lunch time sandwich joint than this place. The staff is friendly, and the food is always awesome. I really Love their salads and wraps, they are huge portions and leave you full, without the heavy feeling. I call my order in and swing by and pick it up. Fast, friendly and reliable.

Were originally from Phoenix, but only recently visited Ponderosa Stables for the first time. My Boyfriend and Step Daughter and I went on a 1 Hour Trail Ride, and at $39.00 Per person, I'd say it was worth the smiles it brought her. The horses are reeeeealy slow, so it's a little tougher to enjoy as an adult, but My 12 Yr Old Loved it. The trail guide was great and the trail itself was enjoyable. I hear they have great dinner rides, which we may go check out sometime were in town visiting again.

I absolutely love this cute, quaint cafe! The menu is great, it's always changing and you can tell they put a lot of thought in to it each time. The service is great, and the Mac & Cheese is the best I've ever had. They occasionally have live music, which just makes the environment that much better. If your in the area, you won't regret stopping in and checking it out.

Each of the previous reviews before me mention something that I considered posting in my review of this place. The staff is never happy, the food is always incorrect and you can guarantee your wait time to be at least 8 to 10 minutes on a good day, regardless of how many people are in line or waiting in the lobby. I've written this entire review since placing my order while sitting in the drive thru, and there are still two cars ahead of me, even after one car gave u and left the line.   All right, only two problems with my order today other than the fact that it's taken this long for me to receive it. My side of sour cream that Specifically ordered was not included in the bag that was given to me, I had to remind the  young man about it when I arrived at the window. I also just pulled away to pull over and finish this review and realized I never received my receipt!  So, I can't actually check and make sure my order is correct as it was placed.   It never fails... Which is super disappointing! It's unfortunate I love Taco Bell so much and this is the only one in the area, so regardless of how I feel and my expectations,  I'll be back.

I Love 5 & Diner, and this is by fart my favorite location. It's very clean, and the staff is always very nice. No one can beat the Oreo Milkshake, it's a must have!! My mom loves liver and onions, and while I myself don't have an appetite for them, she loves them here and prefers them over other restaurants.

I gotta say, as far as Chinese Buffet's go, this is by far my favorite, and has been since I was a kid!  I love their food, and it's always clean and busy. It's a small place, but they have a large selection, and keep the food fresh. NO ONE has Chow Mien as good as May Garden's! I love it here, and whenever I'm in town and can convince the family to do Chinese, this is my place!

Food is typical A& W food, but don't expect any sort of Customer service from this group. They got my husbands order completely wrong, and they were hesitant to correct it. When it did come out correct nearly ten minutes later, the girl slid the tray onto the table and walked away, not a word or a smile or even a hint of service or hospitality.

Pretty fast service, and this is the only sonic I've ever found that has an indoor lobby you can eat in. The staff is friendly and my orders are always delivered correctly, a big ++ for me !!

Camelback Chiropractic is hands down the best Chiro office I've been in, and trust me I've been to my share. Dr. Justin and his staff have really taken care of my Husband and I after our recent car accident. He had us started on a care plan just days after our accident, and I was in a lot of pain with a very limited range of motion. I'm far from out of the woods yet, but Charity my physical therapy trainer has been amazing, and has really helped me come a long way.  The adjustments are just icing on the cake and really bring almost instant relief to my sore, messed up neck. I plan to continue my visits to CC as I know if there's hope for pain relief, it will be with the help of Dr. Justin and his team.

They always have the best service, and friendliest staff!! Even during busy weekend breakfast hours, the hostesses, wait staff and bussing staff communicate well and keep the crowd moving in an out. My daughter hit her head on the table and our waitress brought her a bag of ice for her quickly developing goose egg, and even the manager came over to check on her.    Food here is always great, we've never had any complaints. I don't think I've eve had a bad CB experience anywhere, but we just kinda prefer the staff here. :-)

Awesome place, great sweet tea and amazing Chicken. The sauce is ok, but it doesn't quite do the Chicken justice. Very Clean place with friendly staff. :-)

Beautiful place, and a super sweet family that runs it.. The food is great, and you can't beat the service you'll receive. My Mom goes here faithfully, and they now know her by name. I can tell you the Strawberry and Chicken salad is the best I've ever had! The food is reasonably priced, and the portions are decent.   It's fun to be able to support small local buisnesses, and that's what downtown Glendale is filled with.   I live in San Diego now, but I know I'll be visiting the Spicery next time I'm in town.

I'm in awe at the lack of knowledge and professionalism that Ms. Zarling displays. I can just be happy that she wasn't representing me and my family during a recent family court matter. Thankfully, she was representing the other party in our case, because she made so many poor calls, it would have costed us so much more wasted time and money. As It is, the repeat requests to resend e mails because she had lost them, or delay of action or response because she was with her Family at Disneyland were all "issues" we ended up paying for. My responsible lawyer had to send her multiple copies of documents, repeatedly chase her down to get status updates on signatures, and even remind her of our court deadline. She advised the other party that the parent information class wasn't required, which is completely different than what the county website and courts specifically request. Here we sit one day from a court deadline and realized today that her lack of attention to detail could yet again hold up the closing of our case. After three months ( and no, no changes were made during that time) She had her client sign the documents and never had them notarized. Oops. But, exactly what I would expect from her.   Look,  I'm sure she's great at corporate/bankruptcy law, but family court just isn't her thing. Please, do your research. Don't settle with Ms. Zarling. Her partners may be great, but she's not the kind of professional you want representing you when it comes to your family.

AMAZING Street Tacos for $1.50? Sign me up! We Love the tacos these guys make, and they are always very friendly also. The Carne Asada is to die for! It's moist and full of flavor, unlike others in the valley who try to make it. We tell everyone about this place!

The staff here is always very nice, and the food is delicious! The Parmesan bread they use for the turkey avocado is amazing! It's nicely decorated with coca-cola decor, and it makes for a fun themed lunch!

I cannot believe I've waited this long to do a shoot like this! I had such an incredible time, and I owe it all to the staff at Optionz. Right from the moment I walked in, they were friendly and talkative and made me feel at ease. I'm not a small girl, but confident in myself and wanted to bring out the fun, flirty, sexy side of me. These women did exactly that. They didn't let my size deter them from helping me have a fun, memorable experience that produced some impeccable photographs. I left there feeling like a million bucks, and have incredible confidence in my final product.   This isn't just about going and having nice photographs taken,  but the whole uplifting confidence boosting experience. It's worth every penny. You owe it to yourself! You'll have great photos to share with your special someone, but more importantly you'll have that reminder of just how fun and beautiful you are, regardless of your shape, size or skin color.

Waiting to pick up my dinner order, and am super excited as always. My husband loves the brisket dinner, and you can't go wrong with their pulled pork dinner and side of Mac & Cheese. The staff is always very nice, and I love that we can support a small family owned, local business. Great food, awesome prices and stellar service, we're regulars!

Rather disappointed in this place actually. Food was good, not amazing , but good. But portion size , topped with poor service made it a place we'll skip when picking a quick dinner out. I don't get their menu. Food and sides don't go together really, and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. When we were ordering, it seemed as if we were bothering her, which was slightly awkward. Overall, not a good experience. Cool name, but not relative to the food at all. I'd say skip this place.

Incredible food, and good service. I love the huge baked potato stuffed with all the good stuff and pulled pork.   There is a small country store in the front with sodas, ice, beer and snacks, then the restraunt towards the back. Their food is incredible and full of flavor. We are a huge BBQ family and have already returned 3 times since our first introduction. It's picnic bench seating, and you eat in paper instead of plates. Which, is really cool and not at all a deterrent. I only tell you so you can be prepared for things to get a little messy :-)

I'm so Happy this place is here! The food was great and the service was exceptional. Viri was our waitress, and she did an incredible job. My husband and I came and brought our 7 year old, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a children's menu, with all the favorites kids could enjoy.   Let me tell you. The Cabin Mac n' Cheese was epic. Loaded with different cheeses and bacon! It was a perfect portion, and full of flavor. My husband had the BBQ burger and really enjoyed it as well.   We will for sure be returning. This place was good for dinner, and seems like it would be a lot of fun to enjoy during a girls night out. They appeared to have a full bar, and plenty of room for dancing also.   One of the ladies from the management team even came by to ask about our experience, and that goes a long way with me! Kudos to the staff here! Keep up the great service and you'll be spot on!

This is our new default lunch restaurant! The place is super clean, the staff is incredibly nice and the food is Epic. I've had both the Carne Asada Tacos and the Supreme Carne Asada Nachos, and I'm always full and completely satisfied. The portions are awesome! Ohh, and I love that they have a large variety of hot sauce. It really gives you an opportunity to try something new each time you come.   Oh, and for all you guacamole fans, the Guac here is amazing. You can get your first side of Chips and Guac  free if you write a yelp review, just like I did :-)
