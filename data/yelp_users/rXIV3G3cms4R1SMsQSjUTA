The person who used to cut our children's hair has left. I think her name was Shawna? Shawna was amazing. She was personable, gentle and understanding of my sons' needs, and she always gave great hair cuts. Shawna please tell us where you are! Our last two visits to Cool Cuts 4 Kids were not good experiences. The two ladies who work there now are unprofessional. One woman kept talking with the other about her very personal health issues in front of my children which they had all kinds of questions about later. The other lady is rude and handles the boys roughly while speaking in a fake sweet voice. One time she even told my sensitive son that he needs to be tougher. The rude lady does not know how to operate their gaming systems which is the only reason why my sons were willing to get their hair cut there; therefore now that Shawna is gone, the games were the only reason I was willing to drive 20min and pay for a mediocre haircut there. One of my sons was in tears when we got home after the last cut because the hair dresser butchered his hair so badly. He gets upset everytime he looks in the mirror and is refusing to ever get his haircut again. Obviously, we won't be back.

I am so disappointed. We really like the burgers here, and in the past ate here at least once a month. Unfortunately, after the service that we rec'd tonight, we will not be back. This time we decided to order take-out, and when we got home we realized that the order was messed up. We ordered fries and 3 burgers one of which was supposed to be just a beef patty wrapped in lettuce w/ extra lettuce (my son can not have wheat or dairy). Unfortunately, they put it on a bun and added cheese to it. Taking the bun off is not a big deal but it would have been impossible to get the cheese off. It is inconvenient to drive back there again, but my son had his heart set on a burger. I called Lobby's and spoke to the owner who happened to be the person who took my order when I called earlier. All I wanted to do was exchange burgers. The owner was extremely argumentative on the phone, spoke to me in a rude manner, and told me that I didn't make sense, but he did agree to make a new one. When my husband arrived to swap the burgers, the employees told him that he needed to bring our entire order back in order to swap out the one messed up burger. Then the owner came out and started arguing with my husband and told him that he should have just scraped the cheese off. They did finally start making a new burger which he had to sit there and wait for while my son hungrily waited at home, even though I called in advance. Then as my husband tried to leave the owner followed him to the door and told him that people try to pull some kind of messed-up-order-scheme on them all the time and they end up having to throw away so much food because of it. Seriously, we gained nothing from this experience but a lot of wasted time and a hungry, cranky child. We did not ask for complimentary food or our money back. All we wanted was food that our son would be able to eat without getting sick. I am completely shocked by the owner's aggressive behavior and will not be back again.  Truth be told, one of our other burgers was messed up too. It was supposed to be wrapped in lettuce, but they put it on a bun. Not a big deal, we just took the bun off of it. Perhaps, I wasn't clear enough when I ordered, although this is how I always order it there and have never had an issue before. The mistakes were inconvenient, but it wouldn't have deterred us from coming back in the least had it not been for the rude, aggressive owner.

The store is very small and extremely cluttered. I was very uncomfortable trying to get around w/my pregnant belly. They put the buying counter in the back corner of the store so you have to schlep your stuff through the maze of narrow aisles and navigate over toys strewn across the store while lugging your stuff to sell. Speaking of toys strewn across the store, do not bring your child here as they are not allowed to touch the toys. They do have a tiny play space in the back of the store, but if your child is not ok w/being left alone in a strange place do not bring them with you. One staff member that I encountered was pleasant, while the other three were down right rude.  Their clothes looked to be in good condition at decent prices, and they were fair (or at least average) in buying my used clothing. They do force you to choose cash or trade, and they won't let you do a combination. Overall, I do not think I'll be back. It was a very uncomfortable experience, and there are too many other used children's clothing stores in the valley to have to put up with rudeness.

I ordered take-out from Nandini tonight and it was delicious. While my family chose to eat burgers from elsewhere, I was in indian food heaven with chicken pakoras, palak paneer, chana masala, basmati rice and butter naan. My kids did chow down on the chicken pakoras though and really liked them. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow so I can have the leftovers. My food was hot and ready on time and the person who helped me (I'm assuming the owner) was very friendly.

We just went here for breakfast for the first time and everything was delicious and so satisfying. My 8 yr old has a lot of food sensitivities (wheat, dairy, egg and citrus) and the owner was so helpful and accommodating. He had gluten free pancakes w/the smores mix added in and he was so happy with it! He ate two entire very hearty pancakes which is quite a lot for him. Overall my whole family was very pleased. My three year old had the chocolate peanut butter oatmeal, I had the banana bread oatmeal w/PB and yogurt, my husband had the banana bread oatmeal w/almond butter and yogurt. We cant wait to go back and try all the other flavors. This is not your average bowl of oats! They also have smoothies, fruity chia drinks, baked goods, and lunch items.
