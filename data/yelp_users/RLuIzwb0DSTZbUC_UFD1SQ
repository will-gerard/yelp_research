Most of the girls that work at this location have the worst customer service. They are obnoxious and loud in the dressing rooms, They behave like children. The girl that checked me out at the counter entered my email address wrong after I told her letter for letter. Safe to say most of the girls at this location are just a bit ditzy and unfocused.   Which is always a pleasure dealing with. NOT!

Last few times I came into this location the girls were so friendly and helpful! So glad they got rid of the unfriendly girls! - Jill is so awesome, she helped me fix a bathing suit top that I had bought over a year ago. Jill should be manager of the store! She's so helpful!

we sat ourselves At a nice shady table, person I was with noticed a worker looking at us and asked if this section was being used he said yes, he then asked what beers they had on tap. His response was "lots" and not in a funny joking way. We didn't have any menus so he said okay well could we get some menus then? He then goes and gets the menus and throws them in front of us and doesn't even bother to point any beers out. We asked if they had good burgers he told us the burger special (that was nice) Cool patio, fun atmosphere. But the servers are not all that friendly. My coke was flat so I asked for a sprite, the server felt the need to tell me when he got back with the sprite that he just tried the coke and it was fine.. Unnescarry to say the least.  The guy that brought out our food was very nice. We also had the Cajun shrimp, was great! Although it only comes with two pieces of bread when we asked for more we didn't get it till the nice boy brought out our burgers so by that time it wasn't needed.

Chips & salsa are really good! Cheese crisp is awesome! The margaritas are to die for! The strawberry margarita is my favorite! It's a little loud, chips & salsa doesn't come out right away you need to ask, the decorations are great! it's a very chill atmosphere good lighting, plenty of TVs to watch sports on Sunday!

My mom and I went in this store this afternoon. I have been in a few times myself and had nothing bad to say. But this time the three girls that were in there were so overly chatty it was almost as if they were being rude. Saying things like oh my gosh you guys are both wearing pink? It's not Wednesday you should have waited till tomorrow. Just bizarre chatter that wasn't necessary it made me uncomfortable and couldn't wait to exit. Being friendly is great but there was nothing friendly about their demeanor, it was catty. One of them even complemented my sandals and said "it's really hard to find cute sandals but those are really cute " which I find extremely odd when the store sells sandals? Lol A friendly hello is great, just Let us roam the store in peace without the unnecessary comments...

My first experience at sun-gun I was sprayed by Dana and was happy with the outcome of my tan and was happy with my experience with her she's very friendly and accommodating which is why I chose to return again but the day I scheduled my second tan Dana wasn't available and the girl on the phone assured me that I'd be in good hands so I agreed to go in. When I got there there were two girls behind the desk one of them asked if I was Morgan I said yes and she said okay what are we doing today. She didn't even say her name or care to tell me that she was the one that was going to be tanning me. I told her Dana did a medium spray and I was happy with it and I'd like to do that one again, she said okay and brought me to the room. During my tan she didn't really ask me anything.. Dana was very clear with the her questions and what what I wanted this girl was nothing like Dana. She just was spraying away and was doing whatever she wanted, she asked me if I wanted my hands sprayed and I said yes because I'm not a spray tan expert like she supposed to be? so my hands turned out orange and horrible! My face is orange and I have lines around my mouth the whole tan is just bad! I don't even think she sprayed my boobs my boobs are white especially compared to my hands my hands are so orange and dark it's so bad! And she said during the spray tan that she doesn't like to spray feet.. I don't know why she sprayed my hands if she doesn't want to spray feet?? but anyway, I have spots on my feet and two of my toes on each foot are orange! Payed $49 so not happy with my tan it looks awful! - I called the salon & one of the managers answered the phone, I told her I was not happy with my tan and she said that I could come in and get it fixed or wait till the tan went away and come in for a new tan by Dana or a manager. It sucks I have to walk around for the next week looking like a blotchy orange mess..

Went in for a fill because my salon is closed on Sunday's, wasn't impressed with my French gel coat, it's messy and not even. Won't be returning.

Very clean quiet place, I've been here only once for a SL manicure and regular pedicure. The pedicure was very good! Very good products! You can just feel the difference without all the chemicals like most salons. I'm absolutely in love with this place and oh so excited to go back and pick a new color! They offer complementary wine and margaritas on the weekends! & have an app for your phone to make appointments and and receive special offers!

Very friendly staff, They always offer cold water. Great selection of polish, good place for a pedicure. They are doing lots of remodeling. Looking forward to seeing the outcome, it's coming along very nice.

I have been to the paradise valley location and the Old Town location both experiences were great! I did the sugar Brazilian wax for the first time, I love it!! Layne is the sweetest! (She is at the Old Town location) She truly is a sweetheart! She makes you feel so relaxed and calm! Get the monthly membership to save$$ it's a great deal! Layne also has some great products available for sale. ouch cream for before your wax, and an exfoliating cream that works awesome! She has tons of candy and her room is so girly and clean! Love it!
