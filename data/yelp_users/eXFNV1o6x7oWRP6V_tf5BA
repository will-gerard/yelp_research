I decided to try this place because I'm new to the area, so if I'm going to hit up a cheap nail place, might as well try and find the best one. .   I came in on a Wednesday afternoon, the place was empty so I got in right away. I wanted a shellac manicure, because I have a hard time with polish peeling or chipping right away. They have a WIDE array of shellac colors and options, so I was excited about that. I picked out my color and the guy started my manicure.  The color I picked out was a dark blue with glitter over it, and as he was doing my nails I noticed he put the glitter on first. I wondered why he was working backwards, but I waited to see the outcome because I hadn't had a gel manicure in awhile and didn't know if this was the way it was done. Welllll turns out, fool messed up my nails. He did the coloring backwards, and after arguing with another lady in front of me in another language, she told me he made a mistake and she would fix it. So she had to dremmel and soak off what he had just done, which was practically everything except the blue color and top coat, and start over. I was kind of annoyed but I didn't want to walk out of there without what I came for and I had time, so I let her do them over again.  She did a good job, although I felt it was a little rushed compared to how the other guy worked. Could've been her style, could have been that she was pissed for having to fix his mistake.   Overall, I wouldn't return. They did give me a coupon for a discount next time, but they could've discounted my services this time. Sometimes you only have one chance to make a good first impression.

Don't bother calling in your To-Go order ahead, they won't have it when you get there.

4 stars, since I haven't actually delivered yet - that's the important part, right?  So far I love Dr. Layton. Husband is also a fan. I see him every time - not a NP or PA, and he takes his time answering questions and is very down to earth.  Ultrasounds on first 2 appointments, I know others only get 2 their entire pregnancy. Blood is drawn in office, they don't send you to another lab.

My sister had her tragus pierced here. I think you have to park in the lot on University, and then walk to the shop. We were a walk-in and did not have an appointment, so the wait was a little long - but there is a couch to sit. They had 2 piercers there. I don't remember the guys name, but he was funny and made the experience enjoyable. He was quick and did a good job - I've seen some piercers struggle with getting the jewelry in. I think the jewelry was a little over priced, you can probably find cheaper on reputable websites, so I would say don't go all out on jewelry when you come here - just get something simple and then replace after it has healed to save some money.

I am still on Cloud 9 after my facial with Kari this week. I became a member after my first visit. Pricing is great for the level of service provided.   The girl up front was very polite, but was either new or had her wires crossed when explaining and signing me up for the membership. Told me about all of the perks, and then backtracked and said I couldn't use them after all, or had to add services to use them. Understandable, presentation was just bad.

Came for lunch. From what I saw, all of the seating is outdoors - so don't come here if you want to be inside or away from the heat. They do have misters. We were the only ones in the entire place, 1 waitress. Believe the other reviews when they say the food comes out SLOW and not at the same time. Half of our party was done before the other half got its food. Quality of the food was just OK, nothing to rave about, burgers come plain, just cheese, no other toppings.  Only reason I gave the place 2 stars instead of 1 is it LOOKs like a cool spot, maybe it's better at night - but I won't be going back during the day.

Two words. Sweet Pork. That is all you need to know. This place is one of my absolute favorites.  I prefer this place over the likes of Chipotle any day, wish I lived closer.  Closed on Sunday :(

My boyfriend brought home an arrangement on Friday and it didn't make it through the weekend, I was so disappointed because the arrangement was beautiful! I called Karin and she apologized and replaced my flowers the next day! She was sure to ask my favorite flowers, colors, style - and my new flowers are just as gorgeous if not more than the last. It's unfortunate the first set didn't last, but I was overly impressed by her concern and desire to make it right. You can't beat that kind of customer service.

UPDATE --  Received a second arrangement from here, and it was our last. When my fiance brought it home it looked so horrific I asked where he got it from, assuming he would say the grocery store or somewhere putting out sub-par florals, and when he told me the place I couldn't believe it. And lets just be clear, I am NOT picky about flowers - AT ALL. I sent a photo to several friends and they all said they looked horrible.  Of course I called and explained, brought it back the next day and they re-did it. But I feel like twice in a row is two times too many. Especially when you're paying at least $40 an arrangement - for dead flowers.  I would have given them 1 star but they were polite about it and offered to replace the arrangements - which was inconvenient and defeated the purpose, but courteous nonetheless.

One of the few places I've been able to find pipe tobacco.   Wish the employees were friendlier. I've been to this location twice and while the second visit was better than the first, I still felt uncomfortable. Employee wasn't overly helpful and made me feel stupid for asking questions or like I was bothering him.   I'll be back I'm sure, but I don't look forward to coming in here.

First time ever at Thai Basil. This location is SUPER small inside and they were somehow able to accommodate a table of 11 at noon. Service was fast and food was on point. Coworkers have said it can be kind of hit and miss but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Thai Basil Chicken lunch special, it comes with a salad, rice, and an egg roll for $10.

I've been to this location several times with both my husband and my parents, but never for myself.  The last time I came in, both of my parents were kicking and screaming through the entire process, they didn't want to be there or have to go through Shoe Dog, despite all of my convincing. Frank was knowledgable and patient with my grumpy old man, never pushy and worked with our requests.  Since then, they've both been back several times for more shoes and insoles. This last time I finally decided to give it a try and what a difference it has made!   Do yourself a favor and at least get fitted for some insoles. They're a bit expensive but they last awhile and your feet will thank you.

Wasn't really for me.   The food wasn't bad, I just didn't really enjoy it. It was bland and I'm not a fan of meat and noodles in water.   I probably wouldn't choose to come back here.

Besides the strange clientele that came in and out, they replaced my iPhone 5 screen in less than an hour for under $90 using the Yelp deal. They also provide a 30 day warranty.   Lost a star because there was only one employee to assist customers so we waited quite awhile, but they do have a sitting area.

This place is fucking worthless.  A half-ass Wal Mart in every sense of the word. None of the department items are ever fully stocked. They never have what I need.   Also - did I mention ghetto? For a WalMart, that is saying a lot.  One of the pharmacy techs asked my husband if he had AIDS, because the computer said ADS next to his name (which she later found out meant update his address). Like, wtf.   The photo center is just a bunch of do it yourself printers. And the employees have no knowledge.   Don't waste your time, try another store or hit up Target.

This place is great. Always clean, always have new flavors rolling through, and they carry all of my favorite toppings.  Place usually isn't crowded or hard to get to/park like some of the other mall type yogurt shops.  The owner is almost always there and super nice.  They have deals on different days of the week - double stamp Tuesdays or BOGO Thursdays!  They also have a milkbone flavor for your pup - and they have prepacked bowls you can take home and freeze for later!

I refuse to take my dogs anywhere else. I almost wish this place was my little secret and I could keep it all to myself. Grooming is great, boarding is great, training classes are all GREAT. But what makes this place so special - is the owners. Tammy is an angel sent from dog lady heaven and the comfort level that Wiggles and Wags provides and allows me to have when leaving my dogs in their care is priceless.

I must be missing something. Maybe I'm not a Thai food person? We ordered via GrubHub, delivery was earlier than promised. Food was, just okay? I didn't care much for mine - Pad Thai. Husbands was slightly better - Drunken Noodles. Spring rolls were excellent and huge! I probably wouldn't order again. I didn't care to finish mine at all.

This place gets it. Like another reviewer said, from the initial concept and consultation, to the tattoo appointment and completion - this is how the tattoo experience should be. First off, the studio is very clean and well taken care of. The vibe and decor of the place is super fun and not the typical cliche tattoo studio.   Apryl was awesome. I was both anxious and nervous to see my design for the first time but she nailed it at first sight without any adjustments. I let her chose the colors and I am glad I did, as she chose perfectly and better than I would or could have. She worked quickly but gently. She truly is an artist!  I wouldn't go anywhere else in the future.

Don't waste your time. I attempted to use Moxie Girl for 5 months for biweekly cleanings and they only came 3 times before I got fed up and cancelled. I liked the whole idea of having the same person come each time, I understand here or there they might need to send someone else, but the first girl they sent had some extreme emergency and couldn't come anymore, so they sent someone different the second and third time. As for the cleanings, they were, okay... They missed quite a few things, it was more of a going through the motions type clean... and it takes forever (4-5 hours). Each room or thing seems to be extra, so I had them clean certain areas every other time to save some money and since they weren't always used anyway. Except because a different person was coming each time, or they weren't keeping track - the areas did not get hit on that schedule.   The reason I got fed up and cancelled, was because of the cancellations. I don't know if they understand that some people actually take the time to make sure that their house is ready for someone to come in and clean it, so every morning before the cleaner was due to show up - I would spend at least an hour making sure that all of my stuff was picked up and out of the way so that they could come in and clean, only for them to call me with an emergency as to why they couldn't come. They'd follow up saying they would try to squeeze me in later that week, which also never happened. I kept telling myself I would give them another chance but after 3 months of the same shit I had enough. When you have someone scheduled ahead of time to come and clean your house, you don't have time to figure out a backup plan when they cancel on you hours before. The managers were always super polite and apologetic, but c'mon - what do you expect me to do?  So after months of being cancelled on same day - I called it quits and hired someone else for 2/3rds the price, they've never cancelled AND they clean my whole house, none of this every other time BS.  Bottom line, the IDEA of Moxie Girl is great - execution? Not so much.

I like to give places a chance. I'm not a harsh critic, and don't always let a couple bad reviews steer me away from trying a place. In this case, I should have listened.   First off, it wasn't horrible. The food was OK, nothing special. The service wasn't the worst I've had, as the waitress was attentive, but she mumbled and didn't really provide much more than subpar service.   Overall my experience was underwhelming, and forgettable. I probably wouldn't choose to eat here again.

Kevin did two home inspections for us and was very thorough. He went over all of his findings at the time of inspection, and his report followed quickly and detailed everything he discussed previously, including photos. He highlights things that should be repaired, safety concerns, normal maintenance issues, as well as things that should be monitored. He goes above and beyond and is very knowledgeable in many areas. I highly recommend Kevin!

Called Dawn based on a referral after a death in the family left us scrambling to find pet care while we traveled to the funeral. Because of the short notice, our normal boarding place was booked. In comes Dawn, I called during the day and left a message and she returned my call the same day. She was thorough in her questions about my pets in order to provide the right kind of care and services. I discussed my needs and circumstances concerning my pets and she was able to work with me.   The date of the funeral was moved and we ended up not needing pet care after all, but based on the interaction I had with Dawn over the phone, I definitely will be using her in the future.   Let's just say I put my trust in few places/people to watch over my pets - and Dawn definitely made me feel comfortable enough to give them a try.   4 stars only because I didn't end up using services - but I'll come back and update once I do!

Showed up on time, professional, and price was right. Yet I am still seeing bugs and insects. I'm not sure if it is because he only sprayed outside, as I am used to the exterminator spraying both inside and out. I hate to think they spray just enough outside to draw the bugs inside in order to get you to require their services more frequently...The last company I used, I didn't have any bug problems for MONTHS, almost a year even. It hasn't even been 2 months and I don't feel that the service performed or product used was very good. I guess you get what you pay for and cheaper service sometimes means exactly that.

Wanted to love this place. They did an OK job but the design wasn't what I wanted even after I tried to communicate it several times. I eventually gave up after it was already on my nails. He was gentle but hardly filed/shaped my nails. So some are rounded and some are squared.   Also, the lotion he used smelled like men's deodorant.

One of the more intense boxes. A little intimidating for those coming off the couch.  Every gym is different, and if you are looking for the SealFit experience, this is the gym for you. Otherwise I would start somewhere else.

I've only been here once so far, but location for me is great. Price is average compared to other groomers I have been to. Service was good and the time was also average.   The one thing that made me nervous at first was that they have an open environment where the dogs are put before/after grooming while they wait. My dog didn't have any problems but you never know in those situations so it just worried me a bit. If your dog isn't good around other dogs I would suggest asking them kenneled.

I got my food after everyone else at my table. As in, they had already started clearing everyone else's plates.   The pizza was OK. I've had better at CPK and Oregano's.   We ordered Jäger bombs and they were out of red bull.   The pizza cookie was not as good as some of the other restaurants of their likeliness.

Came in around 11am on a Sunday. I figured their would be a wait since I've seen the restaurant packed before but we must have come either before or after the church crowd because we were seated right away.   Our waiter was Dory and he was awesome. Orange juice is fresh squeezed and amazing. He asked my husband how he wanted his bacon cooked which we've never had before so that was kinda cool.   Overall the food was good, we ordered the famous Waffle Dog (kinda like a breakfast corn dog, sausage link dipped in waffle batter) as seen on DDD and it was good apart from not being completely cooked all of the way so there was a bit of waffle batter. Cool concept.   They have a pretty intriguing drink menu, we didn't order any but I can only imagine how amazing a screwdriver or mimosa is with that bomb OJ.

Cruised through the drive thru a little after noon on a Friday.  Line, while busy - moved rather quickly, I ordered an avocado salad and Mr. Pibb.  Salad was delicious. I'm a no frills kind person, so lettuce, onion, cucumber, and croutons does it for me. Ranch was perfect.  Paid just over $10.  4 stars as it was kiiiinda pricey for a salad and a drink.

Hostesses were rude. I don't even think I actually saw her face because she couldn't be bothered to turn around and look at or talk to us before taking us to our table. Checking her hair for split ends must have been more important. She's lucky the food was good enough to make me forget about the rest of her.  Beyond that, our server and the food, (OMG THE FOOD!) was great. I was bummed they got rid of the nachos, but my Mötley Cue was seriously the best sandwich I've ever had of its kind. And I've tried a lot of pulled pork sandwiches. It's weird but true. I almost cried when my server asked if he could take my plate because I was too full to finish. It wasn't heavy or soggy or falling apart, it was perfect. Guy Gieri rested the day after he made that sandwhich.  I also had the cider, pear or pineapple? Or both maybe? It was great also.  I'd come back here in a heartbeat just to order the same thing.

Came in 30 minutes before close on Easter Sunday. There was no one in front of me so I can't vouch for the wait times but I was seen very quickly, the MA or Nurse was polite and the PA was very friendly. Office and exam rooms were clean. In and out in a little under an hour.   -1 star because the girl at the front desk was kind of rude and or irritated when we came in.

Referred through home warranty Old Republic.   Our faucet broke and we had planned on just buying a new one and replacing it until I realized we could utilize our home warranty to replace or fix it.   They called me on Friday and were available to come out the next day (Saturday) but I wasn't available until Monday. They gave me a 2 hour window and showed up in the window.   Turns out the sink was a quick and easy fix - my husband felt like an idiot for not looking at it himself after I told him it was broken. So it was probably a waste of money/a service call, but the tech did knock $10 off of the fee. So can't vouch for more complex service and fixes, but they called, showed up, and fixed our problem.   If anything goes wrong within 30 days they'll come back and fix it no charge.

I wanted to love this place so bad, I've heard so many amazing reviews. Service was unremarkable. Not bad but not great.   Food: Salsa was watery.   I asked for a diet Dr Pepper, which is on the menu - but the waiter said they didn't have it.   Guacamole was too chunky, you either get all avocado or all the mix-ins, not really a combination of the two.   I ordered one of the Tortas - pork. I had 2 bites and was done. Not a fan. At all. French fries were just sprinkled with chili powder.   I'm not in a hurry to come back here, ever.

Can we talk about the Cookie Cup? Cause it's fabulous. Ice cream is delicious. Staple flavors along with some fun and unique ones thrown into the mix. Netflix and Chill? Fruity Pebbles? So fun. I don't think I've ever had a macaroon and now I don't know how I have lived this long without them. In a world where froyo is the new thing, Fatty Daddy's is still doing ice cream just right.
