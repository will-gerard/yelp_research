Such a great spot. Really great food. Beer selection is fantastic. Servers are always nice. And not overpriced at all. Definitely our favorite spot in the Tuke!

It's your standard movie theater. Nice employees, expensive snacks, plenty of comfy seating, and great picture and sound. Pretty clean and rarely crowded.

Sat down at a table and waited for 10 min. Not a single server or employee noticed us. Went to tell the hostess and no one was around. How are they still in business? We left and won't come back.

Devin and his team did a fantastic job on our reroof project. Devin is professional and friendly, really nice guy. He explained all the work and options for me to make the best decision.  I happened to be out of town during the work, and came home to a new roof and clean yard. No sign they were even there! Exactly what a great contractor should do.   Thanks to Devin and his team for a job well done.
