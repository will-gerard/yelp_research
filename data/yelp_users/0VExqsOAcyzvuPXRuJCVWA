Jacksons/Danny or whatever you call yourselves now, let me give you some advice on washing my car: 1. When the sales person writes HW on the window, it means Hand Wash. It doesn't mean pull the vehicle into the machine wash. And when your little man is notified it's a hand wash, make sure he doesn't lay on the owner's horn to show his obvious displeasure. 2. VIP wash means using a vacuum where you use the built in suction to take debris off of the carpeting. It also means dressing the interior and cleaning out the cup holders, just like the nice salesman said.  3. Don't ever have one of your finishers pull a car up to two inches away from the car in front, and have your employees laugh about it. 4. You should hang around the waiting area and pretend you are a customer. Most people there are only giving you one more chance. I'm not.

Best affordable wine list in the valley. The food is fantastic and the service is even better. Love this place. Think I'll go there for lunch today :)

Have purchased trees here,tagged them,only to have them sold out from under me later.  Won't go there again, no matter how good the staff is. Miss the old owners. Kids don't count.

What a fantastic experience!   We made our reservation with OpenTable, mentioned that it was our anniversary, and we requested a booth with a view if possible. That is exactly what we got. There are only two booths available but from what i could see there isn't a bad seat in the restaurant. We started out with a couple of cocktails and went over the extensive wine list. The captain helped us out with our menu selections, and what really impressed me was that he didn't just automatically recommend the highest priced entree. We asked to share the Lobster Bisque and they brought it out in two bowls. It was fabulous. My wife got the Pork Tenderloin, I got the Ribeye.  Not sure what varietal to pick, we asked for the sommelier, who again to our surprise, recommended a few reasonably priced Syrahs. After discussing a few of the choices we went with a 2006 T-Vine which was perfect with both entrees.  The entrees were full meals, with excellent sides. Very filling too. From the captain to the busser, the service was great. The timing was perfect throughout. During the evening, both the assistant manager and manager stopped by the table to see how we were doing.  We shared a dessert that came on a Happy Anniversary plate. Toward the end of the meal we advised the manager that we had planned on a cab ride home. He took care of getting us a cab and told us to just relax at the table until it arrived. My coffee was kept full until the cab was announced and we got home safely in a nice Escalade for a couple of dollars more than one of the discount cab services. ( that was a nice surprise too!) We will definitely come back and are happy that we found a 5 star restaurant in our neighborhood.

My wife and I have been going to Sierra Bonita fairly regularly since it's opening day. We like sitting at the bar and chatting with friends and the great bartenders and staff. I can honestly say that I have had nearly everything on the menu. Last night I finally tried the Pork Osso Buco and can now say without question, it was one of the best things I have ever had, anywhere. A huge and delicious pork shank on a bed of cheddar mashed spuds, veggies, and these incredible caramelized cipolini onions, covered in a hatch chile sauce that is making my mouth water right now. And I am full!  Every time we come in, if Nate one of the owners is around, he makes a point to come up and chat a bit with us. This place has a unique yet traditional southwestern style and identity that Nate has carefully maintained over the years. It's our "local" and will continue to be so.   Last night the food and atmosphere was so exceptional, I had to "Yelp it." Thanks!

Fail. Why? Just compare it to the old restaurant that used to be housed here and that's the only word that comes up. On further thought an acronym comes to mind: WTF

Sam Fox.  Three letters bro: WTF You had it all and you lost it.  Great concepts, great service, above average food, the only happening place on a Sunday. Now you take away the best items on the menu, dress the girls like they work in Mayberry Hooters, and leave me with the impression that you lost your edge. What happened? Did you get some sort of allergy to truffle oil?  Or are some other plans in the works?  Adios , there are other better priced venues around. So when you closing Bloom? That's another one of your creations that is better off gone. pffft....

Worst most incompetent pharmacy on the planet. Twice, received a call that my script was in, only to be told when I got there that it could not be filled that day. Arrogant snobs as well.

In the mid 90s we had a beloved Gordon Setter, Holly, who had kidney disease and was very ill. We found Dr. Mike when we was working at another practice, and were at the point of one of the most difficult decisions a pet owner could make. Dr. Mike came up with a treatment plan that greatly improved the quality of her life, and gave her an additional 8 months more of a happy life for her and us.  When Holly finally decided it was time, Dr. Mike was there to help us all through the process of saying goodbye. Since then, we have followed him to his own practice, and continue to trust him in our pet's care. His and his office's care and concern for animals is exceptional and we are grateful he chose his profession.

I started taking my 06 Honda Civic to Mohan after I had a horrendous experience with a Dealer shop. The biggest difference in going to UMW is trust. My Civic has over 145K on it and like any vehicle with that many miles, it needs a bit of TLC to keep going. What I really appreciate is that whenever there is a problem, Mohan helps you understand not only what needs to be done, but in many cases, how it happened in the first place. His prices are very fair and I never leave feeling taken advantage of.  He knows his craft and I highly recommend him.

I am done with the Armitage. I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced, the food and service was always good.   A couple of months ago, we went there for a birthday lunch. I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita. How can one mess up a veggie sandwich? How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up. Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments, especially since I wasn't the one paying.   A couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday. I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare. When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky, the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo. I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender, on the medium rare side. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said "that's how it's made." I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits. No comment from the server. I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid. My partner's "medium-well" burger was very well done. She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain, do we? We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed, since we didn't see him until the end of the meal. At that point, we made it clear that we were very disappointed, and showed him the doneness of the burger. I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp. We settled on a free dessert. He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture. Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time...   To the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before, and that there is now something wrong, have your people pay attention. Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen. However, based on what your staff said, IF it is now your intention to provide an overdone dried out sliced sirloin sandwich, and  to overcook burgers regardless of the order, then you have no business in the food business. If not, then you better get in that kitchen and fix it, because this sort of news travels fast in my community.   In my book, two strikes and you are out. Sorry but there are better choices out there, and if I am going to spend 100 bucks on lunch it better be damn good. You're just not good anymore. I will not be back.

WOW! Just try it. Delicious! Best Spring Roll I've had in a long time. The Phnom Penh soup was exotic and fabulous. The owners obviously care about their food and their homeland. I will definitely go back soon.

I've been here about 5 times in the past month and yes, though you may have to wait a bit for service depending on how busy they are, the experience is totally worth it. Tonight my trusty companion had the curry for the second time and unabashedly stated it is the best she has had. I snuck several bites myself an agree. I've had several dishes so far and my favorite is the Phnom Penh Soup, though the Loat Cha and the Katheaw Cha are close seconds. The Spring Rolls with the fish sauce are a "must have"- perfect. They have BYOB. We brought a nice Riesling with us, which is a perfect wine for this cuisine.  The fact that it is hard to find is intentional. These folks are "in it to win it" and are growing at a pace that they can manage.  Go there, be patient and when Yut smiles at you, he means it!

I really like this place. I've been here several times in the past couple of weeks and have tried several items from Pho to  Bánh mì. My favorite was a vermicelli dish that had a vermicelli basket filled with seafood and veggies. Yum! Last week I had the curry lunch special. Perfect and just the right amount of spice. The food has been consistently delicious and the service has been wonderful. After my second time, I was recognized as a repeat customer by several of the staff. (My first visit, I chatted a bit with my server on some of the condiments and what goes with what) Now everytime I walk through the door I am greeted with warm smiles and great service. I am craving it right now and may go back there for dinner! Try it, it's a great experience.

Hey goatee guy with attitude waiving your arms at me at 6:10PM tonight when I try to get my car washed at what I hope is your Employer's place of business: You are a fool.. I didn't know that you were closed at 6, the day after Phoenix had a nice mud bath on my car. I had to pull into your decrepit lot to turn around once I realized that you were closed. you didn't have to flail your arms like a little girl and cry out "you're the 15th person who pulled in here just now"  you know why Sherlock? Every F'n Car Wash place was swamped today because of the storm last night. Your boss was too stupid to realize he or she could have made a few bucks by keeping your sorry ass working a few hours during rush hour when people were driving home. Your attitude sucks and is indicative ( look it up) as to why you will never amount to anything above, well, a car wash attendant.
