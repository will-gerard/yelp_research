I ordered take out from here last night, and I love the idea of having New York filtered water in your crust. This is supposed to be the ingredient that makes real NY style pizza taste the way it does. I ended up ordering a sicilian style pizza, and got the full size pie.   My only complain in general would be the cost for my pie. Total after tax was 29 bucks, and thats a lot of money for just one pie. I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients, but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie, and theirs actually taste better! The sicilian here doesn't really stand out. There's not enough sauce or cheese, and the toppings are just so so. The crust was nothing special, and I honestly thought that Pizza Hut's pan pizza tasted better. I got the Vinny, which has five toppings on it, and split my pizza with two on one side and three on the other. I got meatballs and tomatoes, and pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs! Everything else was just so so, I can get the same thing but better at Barros, at a fraction of the cost!   All in all, two stars for high cost and nothing to back it up. I get it, a bunch of people hype up your joint and that's fine, but follow through with it and make that 30 dollar pie blow my taste buds out of the water!

I couldn't find anything wrong with Avanti. Five starts across the board! To starters, the decor is amazing. It is right out of a scene in Goodfellas, or even Scarface. Think elegant 80s chic, right down to the zebra striped chairs. The service is spot on; this isn't your chain joint with some struggling actor as your server. All the servers here know their menu and their wine pairings. The food is the icing on the cake! Everything here is authentic italian, and it is downright delicious! The boo and I had bruschetta as a starter, then moved on to the pasta trio with the gnocchi, vodka sauce penne and fettuccine alfredo. Everything was creamy and cooked to perfection, and we finished with their tiramisu, which was divine. Drinks were strong and were perfect; they have an excellent martini here! All in all five stars, this is an excellent place for birthdays, romantic dinners, and special occasions. Avanti has lots of character, check it out!

Carolinas is an institution in Phoenix, hands down. They make their own tortillas in the restaurant, and they are the best you'll ever have! They literally melt in your mouth, also try the butter tortilla, its the best carb overload you'll ever have.   A few other good things to try here: Machaca burrito or taco Bean and cheese burritos Tostadas! Red and green chile  In all honesty anything you get here will be good. Don't be turned off by the area, its not that bad at all. The worst parts of town are over west of the 17 and further west of central, like way further west! Minus one star because their hours are fucking terrible. They close at 7 or 8, and they're not open on Sundays. This makes it a pain in the ass to get to on a weekday, since I'm coming from Tempe.

This place is an East Valley institution! For starters, they have live music regularly, and they always have an annual show with Melt Banana from Japan, which is always a blast! Sound is awesome, and the cover is reasonable. Drink selection is amazing, and they have a signature drink menu as well. They have a full kitchen, and even offer breakfast starting at 6am! Perfect for those working the graveyard shift. Prices are good and drinks are strong. The decor is awesome, a good mix of pulps and movie posters and the like. All in all a solid neighborhood bar, music venue, and all around fun joint.

Rivas is a staple for 24 hour mexican in Tempe. I would consider them a step above Filibertos but one step below Los Favoritos. I usually opt for a carne asade burrito, and the only reason I didn't give them five stars is that their burritos are not always consistent. The restaurant itself is clean and they have a nice salsa bar. Not much else to say except try them out!

My god, avoid this place if you care about your vehicle. I had been taking my cars here for awhile since I was right down the street, but after my last experience I'll never come back!   I had them replace the radiator for my 2001 Acura Integra. A few weeks later the radiator starts to leak! Apparently they installed it half assed, so I took it back and they fixed it. Fine, but it should have never happened! Two months later, and the radiator starts leaking again, this time from the bolts. I can't take it anymore, and I bring my Acura to Hon-Amotive. They replace my shoddily installed radiator with a Honda factory radiator, and I haven't had a problem since.   Don't try to save money at the risk of damaging your vehicle. These chain mechanics can and WILL rip you off and do bad work.

Q and Brew is another Tempe institution, and for good reason. While everything and everyone else changes, they stick to the same old thing, and in this case it's good.   This is a large pool hall with a well stocked bar, and lots of room. Drinks are cheap and the pour is always strong! Bartenders are amazing and pleasant to chat with. They have some random snacks but nothing too substantial. Also, there are pool league nights and free pool from 3 to 6pm.   This is a great place to spend a weeknight with some friends or shoot pool on a Saturday night, definitely include Q and Brew on your bar hopping list!

Sweet local dive, a Tempe institution. Great place to catch a show, and good prices on drinks. Also, there are a few arcades and a pool table in the back, along with a juke box in the corner. Perfect for pregaming or for ending your night of debauchery. Check it!

Cheba Hut is a place I love and hate. I love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they're toasted! They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks, and a variety of tasty desserts. I hate how it can be hard to order your food cause the cashier or sandwich maker is high and slow as shit. The weed theme is amusing, but it can only go so far before it affects the quality of the service and the work ethic that a business has. Numerous times I have had rude, stoned jerkoffs answer the phone and treat me like I'm a fellow piece of shit stoner with all the time in the world, which is bullshit. I know other people have had the same problem and the management needs to address this; tell your employees to leave the herbage for their own time, and to bring their A-game to work!

I don't understand how a place like this can flourish. It kind of shows that those who play by the rules don't get ahead. Awful, flavorless pizza made by sketchy jerkoffs and delivered by weirdo sketch balls who show up whenever they damn well please. Avoid at all costs unless you want diarrhea soup for dessert.

Man, I knew this was gonna be bad the second time around, but not this bad! Ordered pizza after my graveyard shift, around 5:15 am, and the guy on the phone says 45 minutes to an hour. How the hell can a pizza that long at 5 in the morning? I hate to see what their delivery times are when it's last call. The guy taking my order rings up my total, which is a 14.99 special, with a 3 buck delivery fee and tax. I hate, hate, HATE calling places like Gus's, because their employees will nickel and dime you on everything. In this case the employee added an extra buck to my total, and surprise surprise there was no receipt when I received my order! That's not the worst part though. The pizza and garlic knots came after an hour and 10 minutes, and they were cold. COLD! What the hell kind of pizza joint doesn't spend money on pizza bag to keep your order warm? Also, the garlic knots were RAW in the middle. Not just some, all of them. My gf hardly ate anything, and I ate what I could but payed the next day with a bad stomach ache. People, why do you torment yourself? Sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery!

Wow! I can review NPR on yelp?! What a world! Anyways, one star for never having jazz on when I want to listen to it, and for having the most old, boring sounding geezers droning on a continual loop the rest of the day. I guess I'm not as enlightened as the rest of the leftists who worship this old man snooze fest.

Hon-Amotive is the best place to take your Japanese import, hands down. It might not be the cheapest, but the parts will always be authentic factory parts, and the work will always be done well. Not much else to say except that if you care about your import, stop taking it to Brake Masters and bring it here instead!

This location definitely needs a renovation. Mens locker room smells like human waste and BO, and the late night cleaning crews give off a creepy vibe every time. Treadmills are broken and in need of repair, and AC isn't always working. Get your act together 24 hour fitness!

Fine dining isn't very popular in this day and age. Most of the time a server is hired on their looks and on how well they can coax some bro into buying pitchers of bud light.   Durants is the pinnacle of fine dining in Phoenix. Straight up classic steakhouse fare, from oysters and crabcakes to filets broiled to perfection. Take a cab or come with a DD, because they have the most knowledgable bartenders ever. The only place where I can order an old fashioned and not feel like a jerkoff.  Save room for dessert, so far I've had the creme brulee, ny cheesecake, and tiramisu. All were excellent! Enter through the kitchen in the back, and tip your waiter well, these people really bust their ass to provide great service!

This was another stop on the boo and I's Vegas excursion. We opted to get dinner at the Tao restaurant next door. They offer some sort of VIP pass so you don't have to wait in line, I recommend you do this so you can skip the line of 1,000+ asians. The club itself is on the second floor, so you will have to climb some stairs. Once inside, get ready for some sardine action!  What I mean is that you will be packed like a fish in a tin. Literally. They stuff em in this place, and that makes for a lousy night. The club itself was beautiful, and the music and dance floor was perfect, but it's just too small for the amount of people they let in. Drinks were expensive and the bar was very hard to get to, and the bathrooms leave much to be desired. We didn't do bottle service here but I imagine it would be very expensive.   Aside from being a hotbed of asians, there were also lots of creepy dudes watching chicks dance. These were 50+ year old sausages just standing on the sidelines, getting their jollies watching an ocean of asians dancing the charleston. So yes, at times it can be a sausage party.   All in all, check it out if you're in the Venetian, but make sure to get dinner and a VIP stamp, otherwise you'll be waiting in line all night.

Not much to say about FEZ except they have excellent food and drinks. I usually go with the sirloin and potatoes, and its always good perfectly. They also have a good selection of spirits, in addition to a few special made cocktails. Atmosphere is perfect; modern and trendy without any holier than thou feelings. Happy hour is every day as well, go!

I hate giving this place two stars, but the service has always been inconsistent. I've been coming here since 2006, and the food has always been excellent. Service has been spotty though; during my most recent visit our server blew off two of our drink orders and I had to order from the bar myself. Honestly if they would hire some frumpy old veteran servers then I bet everything would improve ten fold. Anyone else ever had this problem?

This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!

I will begin this review by saying that I am an open minded person, and I usually find at least one thing to like about a bar or club. I am also aware of the variety of subcultures that are popular now. With that being said, avoid this toilet at all costs! We paid a $10 cover on a Saturday night to be jam packed into a hot, sweaty hipster hellhole. Drinks we're expensive and came in the crappiest plastic cups ever. If the bottom floor of pseudo artists, dancers, models and intellectuals bores you, go upstairs and indulge in a second floor of the worst people that society has to offer. Also, if you're a guy, avoid the bathroom at all costs. Find a pseudo artist or model and give them your bowels as sustenance or as art; the bathroom only boasts one stall with no door, and the stall walls are waist high. Forget about dropping a deuce here, just do it on the floor, the art crowd will appreciate you! Also, avoid making eye contact with the bathroom attendant from Mogadishu; he will insist on a tip for creepily watching you do your business. Why the fuck does a shitty little club need a bathroom attendant anyways? Music was ok but its too hard to be able to get into it when the club is dangerously overcrowded. All in all, if you fancy yourself some kind of scholar of the arts, or if you think you're a model, go here. If you went to college for a journalism degree, or a fine arts degree, come here. If you think the Cornish Pasty in Tempe is the greatest thing ever, come here. If you wear v neck t shirts out in public while sporting an amish hat, come here. If you just started riding motorcycles and consider yourself a 1% outlaw, come here cause you'll think you're the toughest biker in the world. For the rest of you, skip this shithole and go to Sanctum instead.

Great local Tempe bar and venue! The Yucca is a few steps above a dive, with a great beer and liquor selection, and fair prices. Great place to start or end your night, or to catch a gig. Also, lots of craft beers on tap in the east room, great place to try new brews if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg at World of Beers on Mill.

Gross late night subs delivered by a nice sketchy crew of degenerates. The meatball sub is made with tasty frozen meatballs from the store, and they taste like shit. Cookies are prepackaged and are probably from 2005. Delivery can take a long long time, and don't expect change from your driver. Late night dining needs to be better than this.

Reviewing the State Fair is difficult because there are so many different contributors to the overall experience. I will just lump everything into a single category for the sake of being simple.   Parking in the fair lot is expensive, between 15-20 bucks. I recommend finding an off lot that looks safe, they usually charge between 5-15 bucks for this, or you can park at the capitol and take the free shuttle.   Admission is ten bucks, but they have specials all the time. The puffin and I went on Wednesday and got in for free with three cans of food each. Good deal!   Tickets for rides are always really expensive. I've never paid full price for this sort of thing. On certain days they offer $2 rides and games, and other days they have an all day ride pass. Take advantage of these deals if you want to ride anything. Be advised, all the thrill rides feel really, really sketchy! If you get anxious or nervous take caution, otherwise enjoy cheating death.  The food is where I based the majority of this two star rating. I am a huge fan of fair food in theory. What's not to like about big onion rings, fry bread tacos, ice cream, and all that good shit? Turns out there's a lot not to like. I can't recall a fair item I've ever eaten that is memorable or particularly delicious. Everything there tastes like shit, and if you factor in the price you paid, it makes it even more unappetizing. For example, I went to Piggly Wiggly's and got a 1/2 lb hamburger with big onion rings and a large lemonade. This was $27. $27 for a glorified value meal!! What the fuck is wrong with me, and with the vendors for charging this much? At least offer some sort of price break or value meal, christ. I felt like a real turd sandwich wasting that much on crappy ass pig slop. The burger was not freshly made but sitting in a pile of old looking meat on a grill. The onion rings were cold and the onions themselves were cut paper thin. The boo got a fry bread taco with red chile and she hardly touched it. I tried it and thought it was bland and small, and that cost $9.50! Jesus, if you're gonna charge that much, make the portions bigger and make the food taste good!  I don't enjoy the thought of fried dog shit, so I skipped all the nasty deep fried snacks. Eating something like that is like going to a jack shack in a seedy neighborhood.  Every year they come up with some other perverted creation, this year it was deep fried pop tarts, I think. The ice cream all tastes like the shit you get at a crappy all you can eat asian buffet. It's grainy, it's watered down, and it tastes like ass.   Aside from the nasty food, there are other cool things to see and do. There is a free petting zoo that is awesome, and all the animal displays are awesome.   I just can't stand the lousy food, and I'm no food snob. I always hear about these awesome new items they have and can never find them. This year they were supposed to have poutin, which is fries with cheese curds and gravy. I couldn't find that stand anywhere, all I could find was the stand with the Viking Balls. Yeah, that sounds appetizing, give me frozen meatballs fried on a stick, big fucking woop.   I'll review again next year and see how it fares. As far as I'm concerned we will always go to the fair, but it doesn't deserve a high rating for the lousy quality of their food.

I've always heard good things about Famous Dave's, and even though I'm skeptical of chains, I was pleasantly surprised! The BBQ here is excellent; I had the brisket, which was tender and juicy. The real highlight for me were the different sauces. Each table has eight different sauces that you can add to your meat, and they really bring a whole new level of flavor out. My buddy got the full rack of ribs, and they were tasty a well. The meat comes right off the bone, and the sauces all compliment this dish as well. Minus one star for having weak drinks, but that is to be expected at a chain. A step above Lucille's BBQ at Tempe Marketplace. Check it out!

Went here with the boo and some friends on our weekend excursion in Vegas, and I loved the experience! If you have a fear or heights this will make you shit your pants.  The cost is average, but it's worth every penny. I recommend you get the pass that let's you ride all three rides. All three attractions are excellent, and they really push you to the edge both physically and psychologically.   There's not much else to say except that if you ever visit Vegas and have thought of visiting the Stratosphere, do these rides, you won't regret it!

Thai Elephant is my favorite place to get thai in Tempe. Expect your standard thai classics with a few twists here and there. There's also a full bar with signature cocktails, try to pomegranate martini, its amazing! I usually go with Elephant Broccoli, which can be prepared with chicken, beef or tofu. Spring rolls and tempura vegetables are awesome as well.   Service has never been a problem for me, and we usually go during dinner time. Servers are always precise and prompt. Prices are fair and the quality is excellent. Desserts are tasty, try the coconut ice cream is there's any left.

I remember coming here when I was younger. This was one of the first haunt experiences with just my friends and I, and we thought it was way badass. Fast forward to the present and it's a different story.   First of all, erase any notions of high tech thrills. This is a straight old school experience, meaning not too many crazy costumes, sets, props and way more actor scares. Done right this can be awesome and way effective, but done half assed and it can be a shit sandwich with a side of diarrhea soup.   Second, the price is pretty steep for what you get. It's 27 bucks for all access, plus 10 if you want the fast pass. If the mazes had some real quality it would be worth it, but most are just dark areas with super dusty floors.   I will give credit for their theming, because all the mazes have a backstory that follows through during your experience. There are four mazes total, with one being in 3D. All in all, go if you haven't been or want some old style thrills, but skip if you don't like getting dusted as shit and have high standards for Halloween entertainment.

Excellent breakfast joint, open until 2:30 in the afternoon. I usually get protein waffles or the Dan Majerle low carb omelette. Their protein pancakes and waffles are amazing! Good service and nice staff, and a super clean dining room and bathroom. Minus one star for undercooking my eggs sometimes, but other than that they're perfect.

My god, this WalMart is like a place in the seventh level of hell. There is no way to describe how horrible it feels to come here. First off, the customer service is awful. The employees are dumb as dirt, and half of them are clearly retarded or tweakers. Checkout is super slow, and a lot of times they will not open a new line to speed things up. Second, they are always out of different things in the grocery section, and they are super slow to restock. Third, the customers here are like a mutant breed from another world. You get tweakers, degenerates, welfare queens and their worthless stoner baby daddies, and every other low brow asshole from Mesa. On another note, avoid coming here at night, because they stack boxes everywhere to create a labyrinth to keep you trapped in their shithole grocery section. The worst part is WalMart will never need to change anything here, because there will always be disgusting pieces of shit that will come here and spend spend spend. Avoid at all costs, go to the one on Southern and Rural, they are usually less crowded.

First time visiting Hulas, and I really enjoyed it. The atmosphere and ambiance is very laid back and tropical, with tiki heads and surfer posters everywhere. Clean, friendly, and an awesome drink menu! Cuisine offers a mix of seafood and island favorites with your standard burgers, steaks and fries. Vegetarian options are readily available. Our party had no problems with service on a busy saturday night. I ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes, cooked medium rare. I'm not the biggest fan of ribeyes, and the price was a little steep, but overall the meal was flavorful and hot. I'd have to say that the real highlight here is their tropical drinks. Men, here is a bar where you can order a Mai Tai with no shame. No touristy girl drinks here, only strong Mai Tais made with excellent rum! If you're a fan of the 50s and 60s like I am, or you're looking for something new for dinner and drinks, try it out!

I had driven by Lobby's many times in the past but I never stopped to get food. A few weeks ago I decided to stop by and I have been hooked ever since! This place has authentic, fresh Chicago style food served with love. So far I've indulged in the bacon cheeseburger, italian beef sandwich and the Chicago style hotdog, as well as their fries. Everything is always hot, made to order, and very unique to the area and PHX in general. Eat here and support a great local business, you won't regret it!

Shit, there's a lot of reviews for the Cosmo. I better make mine stand out.  The Cosmo is currently the newest hotel on the strip, and it shows. Everything about this place is clean, sparkly, and awesome. The check in lobby is an experience in itself. The elevators are fast and efficient, and the casino is large and in charge. There's a sweet bar in the middle called the Chandalier, I think. It is three stories and boasts good bartenders that know their drinks.   The boo and I had a terrace studio room, and it was well worth the high rate. It came with a super modern shower and soaking tub, and the best bed I've ever had in a hotel, hands down. Flat screen TV was awesome, and WiFi was good, even though you have to pay.   Sometimes the front desk will give you a pass for the Marquee Nightclub. Use it and skip the douchebag line. The club itself gets its own review.   There are plenty of stupid assholes here, but that's the whole strip. Also saw Joey Fatone at the Bond Bar, he was surrounded by his all male entourage, which tells you something about his sexual preference. Also, check out the hidden pizza joint, but make sure to find it before your drunken slosh binge.   Anyways, five stars for good service, good bartenders, amazing rooms, lots of food choices, and for being the newest and nicest hotel on the strip. Hopefully it doesn't  turn to a steaming pile of hobo shit in 20 years. To your health!

This review is specifically about the food. I haven't been here for any drinking or shows, so I can't say how that would be. The food is another story. I ordered a pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni, an order of wings, and a cheeseburger with fries. Placed the order and got there in 20 minutes. Took the food to work and the horror began.   The pizza was cold as shit by the time I ate it, and the flavor wasn't very good. The worst part was the mushrooms! They were literally black and hard, and I couldn't tell if that's how they were supposed to be or if they were just old and rotten. Gross gross gross!   The cheeseburger was very small, but the meat was good. Not much flavor but it tasted fresh. Fries were another story. They were cold and soggy, the worst things that can happen to fries. I ate three of them and threw them in the garbage where they belong.   Wings are the reason they don't get one star. They were actually tasty, and the ranch wasn't that bad. They were also still warm.   All in all, I would say this is a great place for drinking and catching live music, but the food isn't too good. Hopefully improvements can be made.

My fiancé and I ate here earlier in the week with the family. The service was excellent, and everything was spotless. My only complaint is that I didn't care for any of the food. I ordered the Bison Burger, which came on a dry flax seed bun, with flavorless sweet potato hash. My fiancé ordered the Mediterranean Salad with no meat, and the portion was very small and not very filling. Her salad was $11, and my entree was $16. I understand the restaurant's concept and I think it's great, but I think there should be better options for those who don't want an extremely clean meal. A beef burger with some deep fried french fries would be preferred! All in all, a great option for clean eaters and those with dietary restrictions, but not for the rest of us who eat whatever we want!

This place is nice on a weekend night. Parking can be a hassle, and drinks aren't always the cheapest, but its good to be able to choose from a full bar, and not just beer and wine. Depending on the night there will either be a live band or dj; both are nice and don't stray too far from the mainstream. What this means is the dj isn't gonna play some tracks that sound like cats farting into a microphone. Check out Copper Blues, especially if you're leaving a show at Stand Up Live.

I went here during the summer, and I loved the concept. I especially like that this is one of the only bars on Main St. in downtown Mesa, right near the Nile Theater. On a Saturday night there was no cover. The decor was awesome, super creepy horror critters all around. My complaint was with the drink prices and the music. A jack and coke was 8 bucks, and a Blue Moon was 7 bucks! That's for a standard  size too, more or less a pint. The music that night was awful; 90's and early 2000's rehash from the DJ and boy did it kill the atmosphere. I would definitely check this place out again, maybe by now they worked out all the kinks.

I am not a fan of chains, especially on Mill Ave. I went here on a Saturday night, and it was packed. Be careful if its a weekend, they will close the line in when they're full and then you'll be left outside like a jerkoff with all the other beards in plaid who love dark, filling brews. This place used to be American Apparel, at least that shithole is out of Tempe. Minus a few stars for just offering beer. Not everyone wants to feel like a fat bloated beard fuck at the end of the night, get a fucking liquor license with your corporate buying power! Beers vary in in price and strength, nice selection of local brews as well. If you're really into beer though, why not support a local brewery? Theres Sleepy Dog, Papago Brewery, and Four Peaks all within a couple of miles of Mill.

I'll start by saying that I can enjoy some chain bars. I actually really like Dave and Busters, as their prices are decent and they have a reverse happy hour. Bar Louie is no Dave and Busters though.   One star and there's a lot of reasons why. To begin with, there was a wait to get our menus from our server. This is a minor hassle and I can understand how this can happen when everyone is new, but I feel like an experienced manager with a staff of experienced servers can tackle this issue right from the opening date.  Bar Louie does not list their drink prices except for wine. This is a huge pain. If it was just a bar it would be a little more acceptable, but for a restaurant menu to not have drink prices is inconsiderate. I settled on a Manhattan, which was on the specialty drink menu. It was good but forgettable; I actually had a way better Manhattan at Hanny's that was made with rye and was a lot less. Like most corporate bars, I have my doubts as to how knowledgeable the bartenders really are.   The food was very, very sub-par and forgettable. The one thing they have going is good happy hour prices, and on Tuesdays they have $5 burgers. I ordered the Backyard BBQ burger, which comes with BBQ sauce and onion rings. It was just ok, nothing memorable, and I actually like the ones at Red Robin better (those come with unlimited fries!). The boo and I got the pretzel appetizer, and this was really lousy. Eight bucks for four pretzel sticks, fresh out of the microwave, served with crappy honey mustard, average queso and tasty cinnamon sugar spread. You should get more than four sticks when you're paying that much. The boo got the Mac and Cheese with chicken. AVOID THIS. It was basically Velveeta shells and cheese with a couple of pieces of grilled chicken hidden away. Flavorless and dull; if you're going to do Mac and Cheese, at least bake it and make it memorable.   The real killer was my last drink. I thought my Manhattan was a little weak so I ordered an Old Fashioned with Jim Beam. Big mistake. I received the weakest drink I've ever been served. It was literally clear, with barely any bourbon! The server asked how it was, and being the nice guy I am I just nodded and said it was good. I should've found the manager and requested another drink. This mishap has ruined Bar Louie for me; I will go anywhere else for drinks at Tempe Marketplace.  The bill came and I saw that all the martini drinks were $10 a pop. Hanny's charges five bucks for an excellent martini, made with gin and filled to the brim. That price is absurd for what you're getting, and to top it off it was seven bucks for a Jim Beam old-fashioned. Skip this corporate cookie cutter bar, you will not enjoy it! If you can check out Four Peaks (excellent prices, food, and drinks) or Casey Moore's (same as Four Peaks). Hell, go to Dave and Busters before you come here, they at least have reverse happy hour. I really, really wanted to like Bar Louie. I love the idea of having drinks before a flick, but this place clearly doesn't have their act together.
