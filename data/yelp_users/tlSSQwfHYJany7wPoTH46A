So I went to a late lunch with the Moms this weekend.   (One plopped me out and the other is her BFF that's been around long before I was doing boom-boom and creating crayon masterpieces on the wall.)   They wanted salads somewhere downtown. And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.  So Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.  (Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have "judged a book by its cover," since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)  So I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.  Easy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.  It was salad time.   Now if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.  Is Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)  I'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)  Anybody want to join my one woman campaign?

Although I didn't know it, I've been living under a rock for what must be ages because I had never heard anything about Fate. All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.  Well played.  I wish I could say the same about Fate.  My dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger.   We didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, "Fate."   I really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake.   After entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken.   After paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.  They were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice.   It tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, "I'm never coming back here again." To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.  Fate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review. I'll just have to find someone else to enjoy it with.

I think I just don't like El Salvadoran food. It's either that or I accidentally consumed the cardboard and polymer display models in lieu of my actual entree. That was some seriously dry, bland food. Even tossing some watered down hot sauce on that pile of bland meat and carbs didn't really improve the edibility. I had the appetizer platter and the chicken with white rice and weird white sauce with a dry side salad. It was a bland, white platter of food. Plus, what's with the side salad of iceberg and radishes? Is it garnish? It's not dressed with anything and, you know, tastes just like a pile of lettuce.   Maybe I'm just an ignorant prick. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I just don't like El Salvadoran (although I love just about everything else Central American).   The pupusas were crazy delicious though. I would totally return for these. (And only these.)

You like your meat long, smoked, and spicy? They got that.   Short and thick  with an au naturel casing? They got that too.   Thin, floppy and tasting of meatloaf? Hey, whatever gets your rocks off.   The snausages here are crazy amazing and they have just about any pork related product your little heart can dream up, ground to an appetizing taste and texture with just the right amount of spice. The prices are also more than fair compared to other meat markets around town.   Word to the wise, Schreiner's is a small mom and pop and they only take cash, check (crazy, right?), or debit cards. No credit will be extended to your broke ass. And if you want to use your debit card you have to gather up at least ten bucks worth of meat in your hot little paws before they'll run the card. Don't worry, it's more than easy to do.   The people that work here are very knowledgeable and if you tell them what you like and why, they'll recommend all sorts of stuff. They have an intimate knowledge of the meat they sling. So stop on buy, shoot the shit, and they'll slip you some mighty fine sausage.

Scott's Generations is hands down the best east coast-style deli in the valley, particularly for breakfast. It's just as cheap as Denny's down the street and about ten times more satisfying and wholesome.   Their baked goods and bagels are crisp, chewy perfection. No perpetrating steam oven biscuit bagels here like Breuggers or Einsteins.  And there's plenty of cream cheese options to schmear to your heart's content.   I'm usually a pretty flexible diner, rotating through a menu to try new things, but here I get one thing and one thing only every time. Brandi's Breakfast Special for only four bucks: two eggs over easy, home fries and a garlic bagel with chive cream cheese.  I guarantee that meal will sink like a satisfying rock to the bottom of your stomach and keep you full for hours. With coffee and tip the whole thing will set you back about eight bucks.  Enjoy the surly granny wait staff that'll call you doll or sugar, and treat yourself to a black and white cookie on the way out. Trust me.

Coup des Tarte delivers exactly what its name suggests, a ravishing blow to the palette that storms your mouth by force and takes no prisoners.  The chocolate and caramel fleur de sel tart is a testament to the aphrodisiac quality of fine food, and it had me moaning at the table heedless of surrounding company, who conveniently were also moaning with pleasure after sampling the four berry tart with vanilla gelato, so at least I was in good company.   The small converted house lends a homey, romantic feel with wood floors, soft curtained windows for natural light and warm walls that were decorated with a discerning eye for color.  The tables are small and a bit crowded, but are not close enough that you will end up distracted by surrounding conversation.  It is most assuredly not a place to bring a large group of people, with a count of four being about the max for a comfortably seated party.  One thing I adore is that it's BYOB, which is a blessing because their menu is pricey enough as it is without tacking on the inevitable, exorbitant price of alcohol.  Instead they charge a nine dollar corking fee and provide all the necessary accoutrement for opening and chilling your selection during the meal.   The appetizers are consistently delicious.  The three onion tart in particular is the perfect balance of sweet and smoky, with the tart crust and caramelized onions playing up the sweet side, and the smoky bacon with Gruyere cheese satisfying the savory.  It is an honest to goodness coup des tarte in your mouth, as has already been discussed.  The chevre cheese and tomato appetizer and country pate plate were also rich and savory, the walnut bread with the pate being particularly notable, although they lacked the complexity of the three onion tart and seemed much more savory.   The entrees were perhaps the weakest portion of the meal, which was surprising considering they're naturally the most expensive.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection and wasn't too fatty, and the honey, lavender, rhubarb sauce was a beautiful compliment to the meat.  The accompanying green beans and mashed potatoes fell far short of the duck though, and could have used a more creative interpretation.  The Moroccan lamb shank with Israeli couscous and chickpeas, however, was off the charts delicious!  It was fall of the bone tender and all the components of the meal were highly complimentary.  The sea bass I've had on previous visits also suffered the same fate as the duck, with an ultimately well prepared and scrumptious protein accompanied by lack luster sides.   But ultimately it is the dessert course that is the crowing jewel of this establishment. Don't say, "Well I never order dessert." Or "But I'm watching my weight."  Believe me, you want these perfectly prepared, sweet and salty concoctions to make love to your mouth.  Every tart I have ever tasted has elicited the same sleepy smiles of contentment and pleasurable moans.  In fact, it might even be a better investment to go a nontraditional route and just skip right from the appetizers to the dessert course.  That way you can order several varieties and indulge in blissful, sugary enjoyment.

When I was a kid I would eat a pile of plain noodles with butter on them while the rest of my family mowed down on real Italian food. I think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them, and tomato sauce hurts when it ends up in your eye. But in twenty-odd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland noodles and into the realm of big girl flavors. I think that's why I was so disappointed by Giuseppe's.   I ordered the smoked salmon with asparagus pasta, thinking, "Heck yeah, lox me up and throw away the key!" Instead, I got the toddler special in disguise, a big pile of noodles drowning in butter, with flakes of salmon and asparagus floating throughout. Ewwie. The noodles were freshly prepared since it was the weekend and were a doughy delight. It's too bad they were marred by such a crap combination. I mean, you can't even toss in some garlic, onions or something vaguely resembling seasoning? Failure, failure, failure.  My boyfriend's pasta carbonara was a thing of beauty. It is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley. Most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night. Very few take the time to saute onions, garlic and pancetta, add steaming hot pasta, raw egg and parmesan cheese and toss until it oozes together into drool inducing blob of yum. Amazing good.   It's just odd that such contradictory dishes are on the same menu.   We also had the garlic bread, because what better to add to a giant pile of carbs than more bread? It was passable. Very dry and crispy, more like crouton, and topped with a delish garlicky spice infused oil. Four tiny toastettes for four bucks though. Not the greatest deal.   I shall be back. I'll just stay far, far away from the noodly combos of questionable origin.   P.S.  To all my winos out there-- corking fee of 4 bucks!

Dear Miracle Mile,  This is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.  Unless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears.   Stale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.  And then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix!   Although I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. "Next? Bread?" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. "Fries?" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. "Drink?" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!  Wait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.  Well I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car.   Wishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton, Erica

This place seriously needs to get the IPT (inventory processing team) on cleaning up the shelves. It may just be the end of the year chaos, but I don't care. I worked at Borders for years back in the day and haven't seen such a poorly organized and cluttered store in years. It may be that they were short staffed the last few times I've gone in, but this trend means that they clearly need to hire some more folks to man the floor.  Everything was so completely dickety in the sections I was checking out that it turned me off to the entire shopping experience. I got frustrated sifting through poorly alphabetized books and pushing aside a bunch of crap that should have been faced out properly but was just tossed in piles horizontally on top of the shelves or stacked all over the place with no rhyme or reason.   It was like sifting through a used bookstore's offerings, except instead of being rewarded for the search by a diamond in the rough, I'm just left paying full price for the crap.  I'll keep to the musty halls of Bookmans and Half Price Books, or the pixels of my beloved Amazon.

Mediocre and overpriced.   There's nothing "New" about their "New American" menu and underwhelmed is the most positive spin I can place on the entire experience.   It's a very limited menu with 15 dollar sandwiches and salads, or 25-30 dollar cuts of meat.  Way to cater to the vegetarians out there with a veggie burger or an overpriced "entree" of seasonal vegetables. Do restaurants have any idea how boring it is to eat a veggie burger every time you go out? Get a little creative for christsake, it's not like you're lacking possible ingredient combinations.  I had the ahi tuna burger, which was ground down to a mealy consistency and cooked until bone dry.  It was then garnished with grody, unimaginative toppings like pickles and iceburg lettuce. Top it off with a cloying sweet remoulade that did nothing to moisten the sandwich and you've got a bone dry tonsil scraper. The roasted chicken was on the greasy side but well seasoned. The couscous it came with was a misstep though. Someone threw a ton of whole mint leaves into it that made it inedible instead of "fresh," which I'm sure was the intention. The spinach dip was teensy tiny for the price, and why the heck is it served with canned, crappy salsa and sour cream on the side? Weird.  The fries were the one saving grace. Skin on, super slim shoestring cut with the perfect amount of salt. But I've had fried and battered bulls balls and they've tasted good. Fry anything and it'll improve the edibility.   Service was nearly nonexistant, although as a whole the etiquette was top notch when it was present. But it was a complete disconnect when compared to the cruddy food being slung. You're serving a French dip sandwich, not some wild Top Chef creation. Dial back on the smug.  I don't ever see a need to return to a place that serves traditional (nothing new about it!) American food I can make better in my own home. I expect more from professional chefs than chicken sandwiches and steaks.  Yawn.

One of the best quickie Mexican take-out joints in the valley for everything from simple carne asada tacos to chicharrones en salsa roja. I love that they have authentic, non-Americanized carne options like buche (pig intestines), tripas (beef intestines), lengua (tongue- best I've ever had), and cabeza (beef head). And you know what, each and every one of those weirdo meats are effing delicious. Cooked to perfection. Fall apart tender. Melt in your mouth delicious. So freaking good.  If they can make beef intestines taste delicious, you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable.   They make their own tortillas and both the flour and corn are tender and flavorful. You'll end up looking forward to that first and last tortilla-filled bite of a burrito, and you'll wish they doubled up their corn tortillas on the tacos. (And don't worry, you don't need a double banger tortilla on the taco. I've only had a corn tortilla disintegrate on me when I've left it to sit and sop up juices for ages.)  Make sure to take advantage of the salsa bar. Get lots and lots and lots of the aguacate sauce. That spicy green avocado sauce is the most amazing condiment. The red and green sauce will suffice in a pinch, but that bright green avocado sauce blows 'em away. The marinated carrots, cucumber slices and radishes are also spot on. Their strange pico with lots of cabbage is a concept I haven't seen anywhere else, but it's crazy complimentary. Give it a whirl.  The only issue I've ever had is with consistency. Sometimes a burrito will have rice and beans, other times it will be a meat-o-palooza. Not that big of a deal, and certainly nothing that will keep me away from the best quickie Mexican I've had in the valley.

After getting my first dog from the pound (Mr. Watson, the monocle-wearing schnauzer miz) I had a voucher for a free vet visit on the City as part of the deal. This place is right in the middle of my hood, so naturally we took the wee pup here for his first visit.   We called ahead of time to make an appointment and clarify that the voucher was good for one free visit and were given the all clear. So thermometers were inserted in very awkward places and our little pup was weighed, measured, and found to be totally awesome. End of vet visit we're presented with a bill for 40 some odd bucks.  After some pretty heavy complaining that, "WTF, mate? That's not what you said on the phone," they waived the initial visitation fee and let us go on our merry way. I've cross checked the prices here with other vets to get the little booger vaccinated and sure enough, they charged for the vet visit in addition to the vaccination fees.   Go to Blue Cross Animal Clinic down the street and they'll charge you the flat fee for the vaccine, no office visit or nothin'. Sure beats the crappy clinic at Petsmart too, where they charge the same straight fee for the vaccines and waive the vet visit.   I do like that I'm still on their mailing list though, and get my yearly check-up reminder for my little pupperoni.

"Great Escape Lounge the"? Seriously? Whoever addresses my junk mail must be posting business listings to Yelp now.   Questionable grammar aside, this place in a word, rocks. I want to lick the crusty underbody of its cracked, upholstered stools and have its dive bar babies. I'll wean those tough as nails tykes on a whiskey nipple and have them hustling gullible pool players by the age of six. Yeah, that's right. You just got beat by a baby that sound like a chain smoking grannie, bitch.  Picture that visual. It isn't pretty. Neither is The Great Escape.   Hell you've probably driven by it half a dozen times and never even noticed it. Maybe your cocktail radar needs some fine tuning. I know all it takes is the illusion that booze can be had for me to veer left into a parking lot and saunter up to the bar, primal "beer good" sense a-tingling.   I realize I haven't told you jack about the place yet, but the faded stucco, dated sign and busted up jalopy in the parking lot should tell you all you need to know. This kind of ambiance can only be achieved through years of hard living in the fast lane and a general air of neglect. Play pool. Fire up the jukebox. Make an ass of yourself and do the chicken dance. Whatever gets your freaky rocks off. Just don't spill my drink.  Bring cash. Or be prepared to pound three drinks to meet their ten dollar requirement for opening a tab. Ten dollars for two beers and shot. What the eff are you still doing reading this!? It's Friday afternoon. Get off your ass and go check out a little dive square at the corner of Awesome Avenue and Rock Your Face Off Boulevard.  Yeah I might be a little drunk writing this review but do you want the triple distilled Erica, or do you want the burning raw power that only some backwoods firewater to the bloodstream can provide? I think we all know the answer to that one. All you have to do is be brave enough to turn to the bartender and say, slap me fast and rotten with the hoppiest stank you got. And make it a double.   Ugh, get some.

This place is the equivalent of salt lick Thai. I could taste very little else over the heavy hand with the sodium in the kitchen. None of the mouth watering aromatics that normally characterize Thai were detectable either. Sorry basil, lemongrass, coconut milk and galanga. "Mixed vegetables" consisted of bamboo shoots and green beans (very adventurous), and the bamboo shoots were undercooked and mega crunchy. Hot apparently translates to a mild tingle on your tongue, so don't go expecting to sate your Scoville craving. And to top it all off the portions we received were meager for the prices.   I might have caught them on a bad day, but there's much better Thai to be had in the valley. Even though I live in Arcadia, I don't think there's any way I'm coming back.

Only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour, so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins.   That's cool though because I can't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o' muscle very often anyway. I can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when I do it's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be.   Saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley. Hey, we all have our vices.   The atmosphere is pure Arizona. It's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating Rawhide's folksy old-Zona and the Rat Pack old school Arizona exemplified by Durant's, with maybe a dash of Monti's La Casa Mediocre tossed in for good measure.   The bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era, with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side. The bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail, the stuff with bitters, or a girly sugar bomb. They got skills.   The happy hour is really where's it's at here. Free sliders, chips and salsa. Couple bucks off the bar bites, which are substantial meal replacements. Cheap wine, well, beer, all delivered with a smile.

This place is straight up creepy and run down. Last time I went all the G&D insignia was gone and the menu seriously said, "Restaurant name to be determined" or something equally as ludicrous. Avoid at all costs. The menu is sub-par, the service is crappy, and the decor is about two decades out of date.

Amateur Hour: How Dinner Could Have Gone Terribly Wrong But Somehow Ended Up Being Rock Solid  The setting: New Year's Eve, six o'clock, South Tempe and Ahwatukee The players: The ravenous Mr. Man and Me, a Black Mitsubishi Montero on a mission  Granted, going out for dinner on New Year's Eve is by and large a mistake. Holidays are the times when it's most likely the stresses placed on the kitchen and wait staff may result in frazzled service and a less than savory dining experience. But ramen for dinner was out of the question. (I've tried to keep that survival food to a minimum since graduating.) So what's a gal to do?   Hop into the hooptyville and cruise in search of something better than soggy shoestrings. Doesn't sound like much of a challenge at first until our two players realize that it's New Year's Even and they're pretty fucked for A) Places that still have seats open cuz all the smart folks made reservations, B) Places that are open at all cuz nobody wants to work when there's bubbly to be had and C) Places other than 24 hour greasy spoons cuz even fast food joints close on New Year's Eve.  45 minutes elapse in which our players dart in and out of establishments encountering option A, drive by potential restaurants while encountering option B, and almost succumb to option C. Enter Ruffino's, a humble little Italian Restaurant located in a strip mall dangerously close to the suburbs of Ahwatukee.   So we saunter up and politely wait our turn for the hostess to be free. "Two. No, we didn't make reservations." And the flibbertigibbet proceeds to seat two parties milling around us without even informing us whether dining there was a possibility. Again, she turns to us. "Do you have an open table for two? No, we didn't make reservations." Again, she proceeds to seat others. Lots and lots of others.  Oh no you did not just rouse the bitch from her slumber. The pursed lips, raised eyebrow and death stare begin to surface. Mr. Man senses the subtle change, "Do you just want to go and find somewhere else to eat?"  A cold, calculating response with an edge sharp enough to cut the horrid poodle hair off the twit that's been snubbing us spews out. (I can't recall what it was exactly. The vitriol clouds memory, often with good reason.)  Then our savior, a tux dressed waiter out of stage left, greets us with a smile and ushers us to a table for two in the bar area. The bitch circles three times before settling down for a snooze so Erica can enjoy a nice meal with Mr. Man.  Since it was a busy holiday they only had three seating times and a truncated menu, but that just makes it easier for an indecisive gal like me to make up my mind. Mr. Man goes with his favorite, the Veal Marsala. I opt for the Veal Ruffino, prosciutto and mushrooms sauteed in a tarragon brandy cream sauce layered over veal medallions. Yes I eat poor caged baby cows. And I do it because they taste goooooood. My meal was perfection, with a side of al dente rigatoni in marinara and perfectly steamed petite julienne vegetables. The marsala wasn't as stellar, but I'm not the one that had to consume it, so to each their own.   The meal came with garlic bread, which was respectable, and a salad that was delish! Their house vinagrette was rockin'. We also decided to kick off the evening with a bottle of chardonnay that was chilled in one of them thingys that stands by your table.   There were balloons and streamers and live entertainment in the form of a super stellar, pitch perfect showman all tuxed out and belting out classics while playing the piano. Cutesy couples were even requesting songs and dancing with their sweeties. Aww. The sap in me just melts. See that puddle of goo at your feet? That's me. Don't step in it.  There was also a nice program they were running that night where they would take you home for a flat rate of 10 bucks within a 15 mile radius so you didn't ring in the New Year with a DUI. Now that's class.  I don't know if I'd ever go back here again (leetle on the pricey side at 20-30 bucks for an entree) but if you're in the area and looking for a dining experience rather than straight calories, hit it up!

I've got some spunky glasses that try to go on adventures without me. I turn my head too quick, they take that as a cue to flap their little arms and fly off my head. I bend down to tie my shoe, they hurry to the tip of my nose for a better view. I fall asleep in them, and I'm not sure what kind of antics they get into, but I usually find them in disarray on the ground or tangled in the blankets. Maybe they just wanted to cuddle, but I'm pretty sure they're conspiring to elope to Vegas without me.   But they're creatures of habit, so it's not too often they pull a fast one on me. (Although every time they do I'm sure they giggle their lenses off as I grope for them like a blind mole-like critter.) They recently hatched a new plan, easily the most devious of the bunch. Instead of working as a team they decided to take their chances solo and rendezvous at a meeting point. That meeting point happened to be my bathroom counter.  I set them down and *plop* what was once one piece was then two. I was so shocked that I conceded a good couple of days to them. Especially since they were willing to go to such extremes to get away from me! While they gloated over their victory I was stuck with my highly unflattering, scratched and cruddy Harry Potter glasses.  After a brief hiatus they agreed to reconcile for the sake of my nose (and my ego). So off to All-American Eyeglass Repair we went! We showed up and were promptly greeted by a young man at the counter. My glasses warmed to him immediately and I could practically hear them purring with contentment. It was an ocular spa day.   He took my wily little friends into the back (gave 'em a quick massage), popped in a new screw (the happy ending on that massage), then tightened and re-bent (lil chiropractic work) them back into shape.   Total cost: zero dollars and zero cents.   My glasses must have sweet talked him while they were in the back because his only requirement was that we come back to him for all our glasses repair needs. Seeing how this is the first time in years these glasses have sat quietly in one place for longer than thirty minutes, I'm pretty sure they've put the revolution on the back burner. But the next time they start conniving, it's off to All-American Eyeglass Repair for a visit to my favorite lens masseuse!

The only thing I would change about Jason's Deli is the location. I want it much, much closer to where I work so I don't have to travel fifteen minutes to lunch there, indulge in an massive, awesome meal and end up trying to sneak a super extended lunch past the bosses upon my return.   But before I get started, I'm going to throw out a disclaimer. I've only been to Jason's Deli once due to the distance.  (My internal feud over whether to admit my inexperience went like this: We've only been once, so how do we know it wasn't a fluke? Well it was fucking delicious. So check. But maybe the next time we go it'll taste like rat jerky and the service will suck?  The croissant was buttery heaven, the soup was full of flavor, the strawberries were ruby red gems of sweetness and the meal was so big we had it for lunch and dinner! I think that's check and mate, good sir. Gah! Yeah, but we've Only. Been. Once. Is any of this getting through to you? Uh, fine you panty-waisted pansy. Post your disclaimer. You just gave me reason to rave even harder.   ...douche.)  It's very reminiscent of Miracle Mile in the way it's arranged, with cafeteria style seating and a queue (I just wanted to use that word) where you order, file through, pay for your meal and wait for them to call your magic number or bring it to your table.    First, the menu is massive with everything from fancy potatoes and pasta dishes to muffalettas and "slimwiches." There are to-go menus hanging out by the door so you can take your time wavering between the po'boy and the panini before you even get close to the guy that takes your order, a refreshing change compared to the hustle and bustle, "Move along cattle!" type treatment you get at Miracle Mile. They have a ginormous all-you-can-eat salad bar off to the side with deli salads (potato, pasta, fruit, etcetera), gingerbread muffins and tons of organic veggies. I won't lie. It was tempting. The prices are also way reasonable compared to Miracle Mile, with gargantuan sandwiches, big dressed potatoes and plentiful salads between six and seven bucks. Seriously, nothing on the menu is over seven bucks except for the muffalettas (which are fun to say, but I only have a vague idea what the heck they are).  Go with the Manager's Half Sandwich Deal. Just trust me on this. It's 6.79 and is half a sandwich (muffs excluded, but they have their own quarter meal deal for 6.99) and your choice of soup, fruit or a side salad. One sneaky little surprise, if the sandwich on the menu says it comes with chips, a pickle, veggies, fruit, whatever (and most of them do), you still get that item in addition to your choice of side! It's a mountain of food, and the half sandwich resembles what a full sandwich would at regular delis (Fancy Pants Mile excluded).  I had the California Club, which came with turkey, guacamole, tomato, sprouts, bacon, swiss, and mayo on a buttery, flaky croissant. It was the things dreams are made of. The Texas chili was pretty good, but Mr. Man's tomato basil soup was rockin', and the fresh fruit was sweet and delicious.  And when you leave, feel free to wander up to the register and help yourself to to-go box (you're probably going to need it) and a super sturdy plastic to-go cup. Seriously. This is my new office cup. It's as sturdy if not sturdier as any cheap plastic ware you'd buy from Target.   Yeah, it's official. This place is the bee's knees.

The concept is amazing, and I probably set my hopes too high for this little joint. Watching a movie and enjoying full service food and drink at the push of a button? What's not to love?  Turns out, just about everything. The execution was totally off. We were the only people in the theater but somehow the service still sucked. The food was mediocre. The second run movies were mediocre, but plenty entertaining after a couple glasses of wine, which were offered at a decent price.  I guess it's the cheap bastard gene in me that has a problem with this place. I nearly bust a nut when I have to pay full price at a regular theater and shell out for their snacks, let alone drop double the amount on a crappier second run version of the same theater fare.   I'll stick to catching the drive-in double feature with my own bottle o' wine and snacks, rather than return to this place and shell out obscene amounts of money on freezer-burned puff pastry and vino.

I'm of the opinion that breakfast is pretty hard to fuck up. If you're not ordering something hoity toity, the following formula applies: hot grill+eggs+meat+carb= breakfast. My stomach and I are proud to say inform you that J.P. Pancakes has mastered that formula. They even include some variables in the equation that will knock off your socks and spin them around your head.  It's the small, innocuous looking restaurant in a large strip mall, sandwiched between an Italian restaurant and whatever the hell was on the other side. It's not much to look at, but when the food is this good, it really doesn't matter. Just stick with it until your meal comes. And don't let the constant loop of incredibly shitty KYOT style smooth jazz scare you away. They're willing to turn the volume down, because the waitresses think it's pretty much shite as well.  They're known for their pancakes (duh), but I wasn't really in the mood for a sweet breakfast. I will definitely be coming here the next time that urge strikes though. Their oven baked fluffy cakes looked superb and come in apple, blueberry, strawberry, banana, german and german nutty varieties. Wowzer. There were even more regular pancake and Belgian waffle varieties, as well as traditional breakfast combos and omelets with some pretty cool stuff in them, like avocado or feta cheese.   I opted for the Hong Kong Omelet, with sausage, wild mushrooms, onions, Monterey jack and cheddar cheese. Ohmygod. It was delicious and HUGE. The mushrooms were gigantic, like portabella size, because they were diced into big old pieces and you could hardly discern the shape of them. The bacon was thick and crispy and the sausage was also delicious. Mr. Man got it on the side with his breakfast. Let's just say it looked pretty phallic, more like a bratwurst than a little link sausage. You'll feel slightly dirty taking a succulent bite out this sucker.  Which brings me to the homefries. They are quite possibly some of the best side order potatoes I have ever had with breakfast. Crisp, small little squares seasoned to perfection. They were delicious alone, but perfection when sprinkled with hot sauce. I'm salivating just thinking of them right now. They were that freakin' good.  It's a little on the pricey side ($9.25 for my omelet and homefries, $8.25 for eggs, meat and fries) for breakfast, the ambiance kinda sucks, and it's located in the hell of old people infested Scottsdale suburbs (side note- we got to see some old biddy drive down the wrong part of the road, twice!) but their mastery of the breakfast art is truly something to wonder at. If nothing else, go for that. You won't walk away disappointed.

I worked in the plaza where this Joe's Crab Shack is located for a year and a half, and never visited there once. The "Free Crab Tomorrow" sign brought a smile to my face too whenever I'd see it, but the word of mouth from people I worked with was that the food was mediocre. And they were right.   Today was my friend's birthday and she was looking for some seafood in the area since we were taking a lunch break. Pete's Fish and Chips was thrown around as an option, but she decided on Joe's Crab Shack. Seeing how it's her day for a super happy birthday extravaganza of fun, I conceded. And all I have to report on the experience is coupled with a shrug and an, "Eh."  If you like the corporate atmosphere of TGI Fridays or Bennigan's or any of those other places where they put shit on the walls, you'll probably enjoy Joe's Crab Shack. You'll be prepared for the pitfalls as well. It's overpriced and under-seasoned. It's dried out when fried up. It's unoriginal and bland. But if you douse everything with malt vinegar and tartar sauce, I contend that even cardboard would go down smooth.  I've been here several times on others' bill, and have left with the same lackluster impression and a belly full of grease. I've had the combos, fried and grilled, the crab sandwich, the fish and chips and the crab dip, and I really can't even rank them in order of best to worst because nothing stands out as stellar or atrocious. It's all just...there.  Plus their margaritas are weak.   Eh.

Doc & Eddy's is the crappy high school party for the non-high school crowd. It's uncomfortable and a little depressing, but if you repeat the ritual often enough it becomes a tolerable way to spend the evening. You just have to bring your own friends and take advantage of the cheap beer, because it's better with a buzz.  Don't believe me? Let's think back to the dusty basement/garage/rec room that you and all your buddies used to hang out in during high school. If you had friends with money there were ping pong tables, air hockey, pool tables or video games. Of if your friends were more like mine, a TV with rabbit ears. (Doc & Eddy's is the kid with all the cool shit you never had, even though you volunteered to use the pool table as a bed in between games to save space.)  Invariably the furniture had been cast off by surrounding rooms, relegating it to its current purgatory where collapsed cushions, cracked upholstery and wobbly tables may have mingled with bar stools and high tables, the occasional uncomfortable folding chair thrown in for the asshole that shows up unexpectedly and doesn't have anywhere to sit. Incandescent lights shone down on your little domestic beer swilling group and the walls were barren of adornment because you were too cheap to go buy some crap posters to put up over the yellowing wall paper, and mom didn't like nail holes in her dry wall. (Kinda crappy 70s seating. Nicely played, Doc.)  But you're pretty much the big shit because your parents are out of town, so you invite all your friends over and hope that some cool older kids come too. But that doesn't happen. (Cuz Eddy's at the bar acting like a skeeze.)  The creepy old dude that still likes hanging out with high school kids is staring down your cleavage chuckling with his douchewad buddies and declaring with aplomb, "Nice boobs!" The jocks are all playing beer pong or clustered around a TV yelling defensive plays at the screen, convinced that the more animated they get the more cred they'll earn with their meat head buddies. A gaggle of girls will descend upon the party later in the evening since they spent an hour getting their hair just right. They'll be wearing makeup that they applied more like spackle and dress in skin tight clothing that advertises every curve, muffin top and camel toe.   Someone will puke in the bathroom. Some other folks will get all surly and square off or shoot each other bitch eyes for the rest of the night. And you'll end up with something broken, adding to the overall depressing air of the dilapidated rec room.  But you'll do it all again next weekend.  That is Doc & Eddy's.

This place sucks.  Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, "Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!" Not so.  It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.  First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.  We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.  The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight?   The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation.   So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.

***Kiddos, if you're reading this right now, take if from me, you're gonna want to go visit the Hannah Montana website or check out the new dirt on that Zoe 101 star who got knocked up by her producer or some such nonsense because that's a hell of a lot more wholesome that what's about to follow. But if you want to learn a new curse word or two to awe your peers on the playground, keep reading. Who am I kidding? Kids don't read any more. There aren't enough flashy graphics on this page to keep the interest of those ADHD spider monkeys. So with that in mind...  I don't usually write reviews about chain establishments, but I've got a big glass of hater-ade (venti nonfat whothefuckknows) at my side this morning and I just gotta unleash the fury before it implodes and consumes me.   Ahem.  Fuck Starbucks.  Fuck them and the flea ridden ass they trotted in on.   By some twist of fate, probably engineered by Loki, I ended up with forty dollars in gift cards to this black hole of mass consumerism and corporate greed. But far be it from me to let free money go to waste, so I've been dashing in the past few days to burn these credits as fast as plastic trees can burn. The past three visits have reinforced everything I've come to know and hate about this piss poor chain of mediocre, overpriced coffee, distilling my hatred into a seething mass of vile, putrid ichors that have accumulated somewhere in the region of my appendix. I'm in a dark, dark place right now folks.  Fuck the pretentious pidgin Italian that's the closest suburban soccer moms are ever going to get to that European vacation. Tall? Venti? Grande? I'll take a fucking medium, douchetard.  Fuck the burnt beans that leave the acrid taste of corporate semen in the back of your throat. Open up wide because they're about to unload right into your willing and waiting mouth, and you're going to pay them to do it.  Fuck the people that order a grande half-caf nonfat pumpkin spice cappuccino, dry, extra hot, two pumps white chocolate, one pump sugarfree hazelnut. Translation: You're an asshat and I'm late for work, so get your five hundred calorie monstrosity out of my fucking way before I "accidentally" knock it all over your god damn pumps, you frigid bitch. The amount of time it takes you to order your drink at Starbucks is proportionate to what a demanding, micromanaging cuntbucket you must be in real life. It's fucking coffee. Like fucking Taco Bell, there are only so many ingredients they can mix and match to create new and zany combinations. Add espresso, cut with a mixer, add syrup. Presto chango. You have an eight dollar cup of joe.  Fuck the people that hang out at Starbucks too. This morning the fucking place was packed wall to wall with affluent suburbanites in their business casual reading newspapers, playing on their laptops and sipping shitty coffee. You've gotta have some place better to be. No? Really? Your life is so dull and predictable that Starbucks is the hippest most happening place you can think of to waste an extra half an hour of prime snooze time? You know what, I can't even rip on you. That's depressing. You're spiraling downward in a haze of bitter java, suffocated by the oppressive blanket of corporate familiarity and clonelike oneness. I'll let you reside in your little coffee coffin a bit longer, free of ridicule. Unless you're the bastard with a ten part order. Then the gloves come back off.   And fuck the stale baked goods and prepackaged luncheon fare at Starbucks. I had a bagel. It was hard as a rock and dryer than your mom's...I'm gonna censor that one. I had an overpriced fruit and cheese plate. Mealy apples and cheddar atop a bed of lettuce, with a wedge of brie to show you they're 'gourmet.' Suckfest. Breakfast sandwiches that I'm sure must have been display models because they bared an eerie resemblance to rubber, cardboard and sawdust. Industrial, mmm. I've also had the donuts. How on earth do you fuck up a donut?! Somehow they managed. Sensing a trend here? Cuz I'm just about beating you over the head with it. Everything offered at Starbucks is the same shit you can get at Circle K for half the price, except it's wrapped in a shiny plastic package and distributed en masse to the overweight gullets of Americans everywhere.  Know what the kicker is?   I had to manually add this location.   Five fucking pages of Starbucks locations in the Greater Phoenix Metro Area and I had to go and add another.   So fuck Starbucks.

Let me help you out here: Gollo burro, green style. Chicken enchilada lunch special, green style. There. Don't worry about anything else on the menu. Trust Aunty Erica to lead you along the path of good taste. These are the five-star, absolutely stellar staples of this establishment.  Now I have to admit that at first introduction many years ago I would have rated this place no higher than two stars. The service was spotty (as has been mentioned before) with a couple folks doing quadruple duty as wait staff, busser, host(ess), and cashier. The red sauce was forgettable, the ambiance nearly non-existent and the menu limited. But like a good mold (think high quality blue cheese) Casa Reynoso grew on me. This place is now at the top of my short list of fave lunch spots in Tempe.  The service is a little slow, but come here on the reg and you will be greeted by name and your usual order remembered. The fact that it's a family run joint is the reason why everyone does double time during the lunch rush. The ambiance is a little dated but it's quaint, and the amount of heart this establishment has compared to any other fast food Mexibertos or bland, hot garbage like Macayos is unmatched.  This is Arizona-style Mexican food, make no mistake about it. The Mecca of Mexican food is rooted firmly in Mexico and this place is the Copper State's take on it. Mounds of freshly pressed tortillas and chips made from snowy white peaks of manteca (lard), fresh salsa with the perfect amount of spice, green sauce that will blow your mind and rice an' beans that are good enough to stand on their own.  Just remember: Gollo burro, green style. Chicken enchilada lunch special, green style.  You're welcome.

I suppose I should write a review here since my little Noodle-oo is currently serving as their spokes dog in the photos.   We both love Scooby Do's. They treat my little butt-faced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that I perceive as being weird. Like that funny poofy pompadour. Mohawk it out, yo. Done. In like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass. Not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses. (He ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too. So adorable.)  The shampoo they use here is also amazing. Noodles usually smells like tacos (a combination of beef stank and corn chips) but after getting back from the Do's, he smelled like Christmas morning! Sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. He's got some gender identity issues to deal with.   The pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there. I'm talking to you Petsmart! I've taken my other pup to Smelly Dog before, but unless I need dog sitting play time after the cut, I'll go with Scooby's. They genuinely seem to like my little Noodle monster.

There are several shared characteristics of a good dive bar: 1. Cash only for cheap, stiff drinks. 2. Pool tables (or alternately, shuffle board. darts must be combined with some other lure in order to count.) 3. Jukebox (classic rock required, the top 40 laughed out of the place.) 4. An air of disrepair (rips in the booth upholstery, musty smell of smoke on the air- because despite the ban, it's already been cured into the wood.)  This place has all those things in spades.  I hardly ever end up at the Time Out Lounge because I never carry cash, but the drinks are deliciously strong and don't strip your wallet of its greenery too quick. There's an ATM there too. The pitchers and half pitchers are also pretty cheap, but if you're drinking by yourself, you're required to get the half pitcher. Apparently they can't serve you a drink the size of your head in one sitting. What wacky laws.  There are several pool tables that take up the majority of the space, but if you're going during the rush, good luck securing one of them. I'm not that great at pool, but I really enjoy playing at this place (usually with a good partner I can coast off of and then gloat with after we win) because of the atmosphere. So don't be a hater.   There's a dart board off to the side of the place in a raised area with a couch and a jukebox. My friend and I got our asses handed to us on a plate by a couple of British expatriates in a game of cricket. But tall dark and handsome can beat me any day. It's all about the accent. Surprisingly, I've never used the jukebox. But I have heard wonderful tales of it from multiple people.

Palo is the equivalent of a late night booty call, but not a first or second tier candidate. I'm talking about that last resort option that you've never introduced to your friends and rarely carry on a conversation with outside of the bedroom. It's dark, raucous and everything is kind of hazy the next morning. The drinks are stiff and cheap, so you can get your drunk going strong and wake up the next morning with a pounding headache and mystery bruises.   I used to come here all the time when I lived at the corner of Priest and Broadway because it was within walking distance and is the first bar to open on any given day. Ah, the memories. Usually relayed to me second hand.   My favorite thing about this place is the graffiti. Where else are you going to see a squatting naked chick crawling with the crabs, little claws clinging to all sorts of uncomfortable places? Well on the inside of the stall in the women's restroom is where.   Seconded as, "the dive-iest of dive bars."

I visited this cute little venue for the first time this weekend and I'm proud to announce that the whole vibe of the Paper Heart Gallery brought me great happiness. I was there for a couple quick drinks with friends at the icansmellyourbrains.com site launch party. (Awkward to say, but a sponsor of Zombie Prom, so rock on!) We arrived fairly late to the festivities, but still managed to catch part of Mad Monster Party, a really old claymation film displayed on a huge drop down screen over the stage. I was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of cushy seating available for me to relax with my two dollar PBR.  There were some excellent pieces of art displayed in the namesake 'gallery' of the Paper Heart, and the spider web of rooms wasn't conventional so it added a bit of fun as I browsed. I was so preoccupied with checking out the art that I didn't realize I had followed my boyfriend right into the men's restroom, which lacked a door for some reason. No art was observed in there, but apologies were profuse, as were embarrassed giggles.  Several of the people I was with were sad to hear that Scandalesque, a local burlesque act, will no longer be performing regularly here. But fear not, you can still catch them touring in the area, so hurrah for skimpily dressed vaudevillians! I'm definitely down to check this place out at First Friday sometime or to catch a show and enjoy the hip, urban ambiance.

One delirious food coma, a heavy dollop of cholesterol, two thick slices of saturated fat and a mild case of diabetic shock, to go please!  Translation: Let's split the sweet tea, a pile of fried chicken, some waffles, the fried okra, cheesy eggs with onions, a bowl of mac n' cheese and a slice of red velvet cake to go.   Brimstone was on the air, a haunting violin dirge could be heard wafting through my head, and a sinking feeling settled at the bottom of my gut. We just made a deal with the devil and we didn't even know it.   That or I was just too hungry to function properly.  But I do know that I would do terrible, devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles. Pawnshops would know me by name and assume I had a hard drug problem, but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!  Perfectly spiced, crisp but not overly battered, moist fried chicken that even Colonel Sanders would sell his soul for, provided he hasn't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance.   Crunchy, buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup, that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin' Waffle House hockey pucks.  Creamy, cheesy, smooth and decadent mac and cheese. A tribute to the best of Granny's kitchen and an affirmation that Kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity.  And sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good! Or red Kool-aid, lemonade, fountain drinks, or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there.  Almost everything at Lolo's is done well, except for their red velvet cake. It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste (it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor) is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland, meaty red slice. It was a disappointment.   But on the bright side, maybe this is confirmation that we didn't make a deal with the devil, cuz his cake was weak.

I have a weakness for fry bread. I've grown up with this food so it's not so much a novelty as a long time staple of this a native Arizonan's diet. It conjures up memories of taking out of towners to Canyon de Chelly to see Spider Rock, volunteering as a Girl Scout at the fry bread stand (all you can eat pillowy goodness!) and eating a "Navajo taco" with all the fixins right before hopping on the Zipper at the State fair.   Disclaimer: Erica does not endorse the consumption of fry bread before having the contents of your stomach whirred about in a frenzy of nausea inducing quasi-whip lash. Just ain't a good idea.  I pretty much stalk craft fairs with visions of deep fried crispiness topped with meaty, cheesy, beany, sweet and crunchity mmmmmm *drool*. Little did I know that full time fry bread heaven was less than ten minutes away!  The menu is simple, an indication that everything on there is done to perfection, especially the green chile, which was a-bangin' when I went. A couple of menus are right next to the register, so wait patiently for someone to pass one back to you if you're in line, or step up and snag one. You give your order to the lady at the register and it's fired back to the kitchen where it's assembled lightning fast and ready for pick up. Hot sauce is on the table and your silverware are beneath your taco (took me a minute to realize that) so take a seat and chow down!  There are the traditional tacos that consist of heavenly fried goodness topped with beans, red or green chile and garnish (cheese and lettuce), as well as dessert fry bread drizzled in honey or sprinkled with powdered sugar-- but you'll be much to full by the end of your meal to indulge unless you're sharing with a group. There are several stews (hominy, red and green chile) that come with a piece of fry bread for dipping and making lil sammiches. Or you can go the burrito route if the siren call of the fryer doesn't tempt you.  Don't forget to check out the jewelery out front. A gent with some turquoise and silver wares is usually there if you're looking to support some local jewelers after your nirvana inducing lunch.  This place is just as good as anything I've encountered on the Res, and ten times better than fair food.   And that my friends is a recommendation as glowing as the lovely sheen of oil topping your taco.

When I was a wee little chit I really enjoyed the myth of the cowboy. Seeing how I'm a native of Arizona, there were plenty of places that satisfied my preoccupation with fried rattlesnake and buffalo burgers, ghost towns and hole in the wall saloons where I'd feel like a hot shit sitting down for a sarsaparilla.   One of my favorite places to frequent as a kid was Bill Johnson's Big Apple, where there was sawdust on the floor, the wait staff carried pistols and sported Texas-sized big hair, and the whole rustic feel piqued my excitement.  I recently returned to this place after a 15 year hiatus, once for breakfast and once for a Father's Day lunch, and I was sorely disappointed that it no longer held the same mystique. It's really not the food or the atmosphere that has changed. It's the same old place it's always been, it's just that my expectations that have risen over the years. I've had some truly superior barbeque since I was a kiddo, and Bill Johnson's no longer measures up.  Breakfast is simple, with a variety of hearty combos. The hash browns were a disappointment, soggy, oily potatoes with no other flavor. The biscuits were mediocre and extremely thick, more like fresh hard tack than a fluffy treat. Eggs, fried breakfast meat and chicken fried steak are difficult to screw up, so that all came out fine. Not exemplary, but perfectly acceptable.   At lunch my father, two sisters and I had five different barbequed meats between us and a steak, with a bunch of sides to share and sample. All of the meat aside from the steak had a smoky flavor that wasn't too vinegary or sweet, as some barbeque sauces tend to be. The pulled pork and beef brisket were delicious, but had huge chunks of fat floating around in them that repulsed my gristle-hating taste buds with their texture, so I had to be vigilant. There was nothing extraordinary about the steak or the pork sausage, and the chopped pork sandwich was a bit on the dry side.   Side dish wise, I was very disappointed. The coleslaw was terrible, swimming in mayonnaise with no hint of any other flavor. The chicken noodle soup was decent, with doughy noodles, but also was lacking in flavor and contained very little chicken. The barbequed beans tasted nothing like their exemplary meat counterpart. However, the chili was quite good, with cheddar cheese, onions, green peppers, pinto beans and plenty of meat. There was not much spiciness to it, but the flavor was great. Or I was just exceptionally hungry.   For dessert we had their deep dish apple pie, which tasted the same as it would have from the freezer at my local grocer.   I was mildly disappointed by the service each time I went. The wait staff were slow and terse, and at one point insulting. My littlest sister is adopted and the woman straight out asked, "Oh, you're just visiting these good folks, aren't you?" At which point my jaw dropped, she gave the woman a quizzical look and said, "No, I live with them." That's down right rude to me, but seeing how it was Father's Day we kept on smiling and munching on home cooking.  I'm not sure if I'd return again based on the overall experience, but I know I'll always have fond memories of it from childhood.

Pizza is mega rad. I'm a sucker for chewy, bubbly crust like theirs. And you can't beat the lunch specials at less than five bucks for pizza and a drink! Salad bar is a little sketch sometimes at this location. I've seen too many young ones duck the sneeze guard and get crazy with the toppings.

I've seen enough zombie movies to feel pretty competent in my knowledge of the undead.  But book learnin' ain't the same as street smarts, which is why I dig the Usery Pass Shooting Range.  Considering the fact that we're in a relative period of peace with regard to zombie human relations, I don't feel the need to own any fire power.  I like to be prepared, but I'm not paranoid.  Luckily, I get to work in some training drills when I go out with a couple of my well armed friends.  As a bonus, it's a very structured environment for target practice, with all sorts of park rangers keeping an eye on the going ons, so nobody ends up the victim of idiocy.  Like most newbies, I dig .22s because they don't have any recoil.  The range provides targets that you can stagger at different distances and I'm pretty good at close range.  But at close range that's just going to piss off a zombie and maybe it'll slow them down long enough for me to run.  Enter the AK-47 and the Russian M-44. Now I don't have testes, but when I'm holding these weapons I feel downright manly.  Ain't no demonic, soul sucking beasties getting to my brains.  Now, the nitty gritty details.  It costs six bucks for a day of shooting and you're required to have ear plugs and glasses.  I think there is some kind of member deal through the Rio Salado Sportsman Club, but I'm not interested in shooting small furry animals and that's what the word "sportsman" conjures up, plus I don't go nearly often enough to make use of a membership.  I'm only interested in pretending that the targets are slow lumbering undead with the all consuming desire to slurp up my learnin' juice.   It's kind of far to travel if you don't live in East Mesa, but it makes for a fun morning and you even get a consolation prize, a recoil bruise and striations from the butt of the AK.  Again, manliness.   I dare say, when the zombie apocalypse is nigh, I'll be prepared.  Or at least I'll know a couple people who are.

What kind of backasswards place still clings to a "Cash Only" policy? A.) Dive bars that can't be trusted to give you a clean glass, but can be trusted to offer a complimentary sprinkle of crabs on the toilet seat. B.) Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner. C.) Cruddy breakfast diners trying to instill an aura of the "greatest generation." Why I remember a time back before that newfangled in-ter-net contraption when I had to walk uphill both ways in waist deep snow to... Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?! D.) All of the above.  Ding! Time's up. Pencils down.   Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.  I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.  A strict "No Cellphones" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.  That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.  And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.  Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!  Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?  It's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it.

When I hit a quarter of a century in years, I decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango. Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.  Now I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.  Cha, cha, cha.  MEDIZONA.  It even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.  An upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?  Intriguing.  Rabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?  Wicked fricken good.  It puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.  Wild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?  Melt in my mouth delicious.  Try to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans "haricot verts." Merde!  Roast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?  Eh.   The lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.  The service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird.   The customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.  But then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.  So I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off. No need to return.

I am a native Arizonan who was raised suckling red chiles and gumming machaca beef. I dated a native New Mexican for four years who thought green chile was the be-all-end-all of seasonings, and considered it blasphemy that sopapillas were served as dessert instead of with the entree. Now I'm seeing Mr. Man, a real Mexican that just giggles at our silly bastardized food in comparison to his mother's authentic flavor. That said, I consider myself pretty well versed in the differences between these distinct styles of cuisine, and Frank and Lupe's was a straight up New Mexican diner.   Mr. Man and I met his mother at Frank & Lupe's for a Labor Day lunch after driving around and finding that all our other dining choices were either closed or packed. And it turned out to be some pretty respectable eats for a a cute little hole in the wall.  The service was kind of slow despite the fact that it wasn't very crowded, but the staff was friendly and very quick to recommend their personal favorites off the menu. With that combination met, I didn't really mind the wait. A meal out on the town is something to be savored and enjoyed in the company of others, and that's just what we did with the extra time. Well, that and nurse Patron margaritas that whooped the shit out of any and all in recent memory.   When it comes to the entrees, I second what Ken H. has to say. With New Mexican food you can never, ever go wrong with the green and red chile. Don't go there and get something Americanized, like a chimichanga or a steak. And if your eyes start to cross once you see just how many possibilities there are, go for the carne adovada. I was obliged to order it just so I could compare it to other establishments' offerings and measure it against my own version of succulent, melt-in-your-mouth, garlicky red chile pork. Not as good as my own (naturally I like mine best), but it was pretty tasty when wrapped in a pillow of sopapilla and brought a smile to my face.  Mr. Man got Lupe's Enchilada plate with shredded beef and it was probably the best thing ordered at our table. Three corn tortillas layered with cheese and beef and topped with an egg over medium may sound a bit weird, but the flavor will make you groan with delight. Try it. It'll rock your wildest expectations.   I only have one gripe and that has to do with the filler served at all Mexican food restaurants, chips and salsa. They were made from thick, substantial tortillas instead of those flimsy lil offerings at other joints, but all they managed to do was be a flavorless receptacle for an equally bland salsa. It was heavy on black pepper and completely blended, so aside from a couple of scallions floating around, it was texture free, runny blech. No me gusta nada.

Best place for pho I have found in the valley. Get the #1 with everything: tripe, tendon, fatty flank, meatballs and the regular beef. Don't let the ingredients intimidate you. It's out of this world good!  If pho is in your future, be forewarned that the serving sizes are massive. I have never been able to polish off an entire bowl. So come extra hungry and skip the tempting spring rolls (also delicious with a killer spicy peanut sauce). Because if you've ever made the mistake of trying to stretch out a bowl of pho by taking half of it home, you know the disappointment that comes along with that cloudy bowl of watered down leftovers. Rice noodles just don't hold up well. Le sigh.  Lately I've taken to phoning in my order and picking up my Pho To Go (someone needs to snatch up that name, stat!) at the same price as the dine in option ($6-8). I have discovered the secret to pho longevity this way. Noodles and beefy parts are packaged separately and the broth is also in its own container. Nothing gets water logged and cloudy and I can easily make four meals out of one order. They toss in all the baggies of goodness too! Bean sprouts, basil, limes, jalapeno and mint in one; cilantro and spring onions in another. Hoisin and sriracha on the side. I seriously get hog wild with these additions. It's like a new bowl every time I try it!

Apparently Haji Baba isn't open on Sundays, so we decided to hit up Tasty Kabob instead of calling it off and heading home. The little parking lot in a strip mall off Apache was bustling with activity, so I hoped we would be able to score a table easier than we had tried for a parking spot. I don't like waiting for the first meal of the day. I turn into the reckapotamus from Hell, whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld.   But there wasn't a soul to be found enjoying a Tasty Kabob...it was a strange Twilight Zone of inactivity. Everyone and their mother was next door at Pita Jungle, but just because there are a lot of people there doesn't mean it's any good, just that they prefer to flock toward mediocrity, like sheep, or lemmings.  Halfway through the meal, I was thinking about flocking too.   Although the hummus came with olives, chopped tomatoes and herbs, it was a bit bland overall. The pitas were warm and delicious though, and the combination of hummus and flat bread helped keep the reckapotamus banished to the depths. It was a generous portion for two, but I found myself munching on it just to pass the time until our lunches came, not because it was exceptionally well done.  So I wasn't ravenous when my meal arrived, but I was certainly looking forward to some good eats. Alas, the chicken schwarma pita sandwich delivered the same mediocre impression. The chicken was overly dry and not well seasoned, and again, the pita was the star of the dish.   I didn't have the Persian ice cream this time, but I have in the past. It's fairly cheap and delicious, so if any of you out there are interested in trying a flavor that's certainly not of the 31 at Baskin Robbins, give it a whirl. I'm considering giving this place another star based on the ice cream alone...but I can't bring myself to. So consider it a 3.5 star experience overall.  I'm just glad the prices were reasonable for lunch, six or seven bucks for a sandwich. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit cheated. The ambiance was lacking as well, with generic cafeteria type seating (as stated before), and the service as attentive but awkward since we were the only people in there, so that leaves the food alone to shine. And the food isn't squeaking out any more stars from me.

If you haven't been here. Go. Now. Stop reading this review, ignore the fact that you just ate an hour ago, and go nosh the shit out of some of the best damn chicken you'll find in the valley.   There are only two options at this place that are on par with some of the best carne asada or red chicken you'll get from a carniceria. Seeing how the only options are chicken or beef (Or both! Go wild!), it's probably not the best place to bring a leaf eater. They'll be stuck munching on marinated onions, since I'm pretty sure the tortillas and pinto beans have got a lovely amount of lard in them, plus their senses will be assaulted by the delicious smell of succulent, juicy grilled meat. That smell by the way can be detected throughout the strip mall this place is located in, and without a fail gets me salivating whenever I walk by.   Everything is prepared lightening fast and you can eat in the place or get your food to go. The combos are dirt cheap and delicious, at four bucks for a 1/4 beef or chicken, and seven bucks for the combination of the two. Each combo comes with two torillas, pinto beans, salsa and maninated onions. Half and whole chickens or piles of beef are also available for extremely reasonable prices. They only take cash though, so run over to the Circle K at Ash and University to the money machine if you find yourself with nothing but plastic. The 2.00 fee to use the ATM will be totally worth it.

The next time I want microwaved hot wings and pizza crust that tastes like a water and flour slurry made love to a bland piece of cardboard, I'll be sure to hit up Otto's. I had to seriously blast those hot wings in the broiler to make them even remotely crispy and even then they were still rubbery. The pizza was so overwhelmingly mediocre we tossed the rest after dinner instead of refrigerating it.   Also, calling in an order and then showing up 20 minutes later to be greeted with, "Oh, we didn't start your order because we couldn't call the number you gave us back," when they clearly had caller ID and the number was misheard one off, was new to me. So was sitting there for an additional 20 minutes and watching them microwave a plate of hot wings. Never seen that before either. I don't know how you're still in business, Otto's. Not even collegiate nostalgia will get me to stop there again.

Having lived in Mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers, I don't feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me. When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.  So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it.   Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.  It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music. Unfortunately it's also on the black list of Mesa, so maybe I should find a way to reverse that programming. It's not just tweakers and mormans, it's not just tweakers and mormons, it's not just tweakers and mormons....

The Bamboo Club has got me all mixed up. Can ambiance and service compensate for sub par food at ridiculous prices? Oh, the dilemma! I like the beautiful decor and attentive service, but I also like reasonably priced entrees with discernable flavor. Let's see...nope. Well that didn't take very long to decide.  I've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing "Mongolian Chicken" or "BC Hot and Spicy Chicken," since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish.   We started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...  Everything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst: *Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce. *Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done. *Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente.  *BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had.  *Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though. *Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough.  *Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's.  *Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.  The side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?  So if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree.   Maybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.  If you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.

Does anyone remember when Mill Avenue used to be a fun place to hang out? Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel.   Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.  I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.  My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food.   Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.  Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.  Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes.   One thing I've noticed over time is that their "hot" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify.   Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.

This place really doesn't need another review, but seeing how it's my home away from home, I feel obliged to speak up from the peanut gallery.  I adore this joint as both a bar and a restaurant. It has the best patio in all of Tempe, nay all of Phoenix, no--history. Alright, probably not history. I mean, if there were a bar in the middle of some wicked beautiful natural reserve, I'm sure it would trump Casey's. But I'm not qualifying their worth based on beauty. (Sorry, dearest. I'll make sure to spend freely this weekend to make up for that slight.) The five stars it gets is based on the general relaxing vibe it exudes.  It's far enough off the Mill Avenue strip that the douchebaggery of those bars rarely flows over into Casey's. I've seen that the only gripe most people have with this bar is the occasional frat boy that wanders onto the patio, but even though these specimens in their natural environment are prone to swinging their dicks and strutting with impunity, they act different once they're surrounded by the regular clientele. The regulars could care less that you're the beer pong champion or top sorority sex kitten, can you engage in a meaningful conversation? No? Then kindly take your bulging biceps and stilettos to Scottsdale, where you're sure to be appreciated.  I love the fact that this bar attracts such a broad range of people, all of whom coexist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and happy drunkenness. The elderly come here for the oysters, the hipsters come here to show off their newest tattoo. ASU professors coexist with high school dropouts. Professional bar hoppers chit chat with weekend warriors. The food's pretty wicked as well.   French onion soup, the Hippie Sandwich, the Tuna Bacon Melt, the Fishwich (without bread it just becomes fish and chips, but way cheaper), the Oysters Rockefeller, the Chipotle Chicken Wings, the Clamstrip basket at 5 bucks a pop...it's greasy and divine. The prices aren't absurd, but are a little on the steep side for bar food, but it's totally worth it. And if you go for happy hour, there are free munchies inside near the dart board.  It's a lovely little pub with a great patio, friendly servers and decent drink prices. Go there often enough and I'm sure its subtle charm will capture your fancy (and your wallet), just as it has countless others.  Dearest Casey Moore, you hold a place in my heart and although my liver denies it, she thinks you're pretty cool too.

Me and Cerreta's have got some history. Probably because I grew up in Glendale, which is filled with boring suburbs of cookie cutter homes surrounded by six foot concrete security gates that house dysfunctional 2.5 kiddo families and promote a sense of community as deep as a valley girl's vocabulary.  So any time we visited cutesy pootsy downtown Glendale it was a memorable experience.  I've toured the factory multiple times and regardless of age, childlike glee paints the face of every person in the tour group. You'll be thrilled by chocolate rivers, marshmallow clouds, edible buttercups and small orange creatures with violent green hair and a penchant for bursting into songs that have afterschool special messages tacked onto the end. Well not really, but it's as close to Willy Wonka as you're getting here in the Valley.  Free tours on the half hour and sampling to your heart's content! Try the rectangular green ones. They're mint truffles and arguably the best I've had. Eat it Andes!! But I'm biased. I grew up with Cerreta. I stole their individually wrapped chocolates from the bins at Bashas. I went to high school with their daughter Candy--who's as sweet as her namesake. I'm a die hard fan of these home grown chocolatiers, and there isn't any other place I'd rather go to rekindle a bit of childhood nostalgia.  It's good family fun, a great date idea, or a nice distraction for the babysitters/aunties/grandmas out there (cuz you'll want to give the kids back right after they o'd on sugar).  You do get an unlabeled grab bag when you purchase a mixture of chocolates, but just channel the ingenuity of the young. Poke a hole in the bottom of each one with your finger. Viola! Problem solved!

I have seen the banh mi light, and am still just kind sorta a convert to the zealotry. It's a damn fine sandwich. I will give you that much. the atmosphere has all the personality of a hospital cafeteria, but the price was a screaming deal.   I really don't care for the cash only policy, but I understand it helps keep those prices at a rock bottom level. Personal pet peeve.  The baguette they use is chewy and toothsome, but there was way too much of a bread-to-filling ratio for my tastes. All the meaty bits they toss in there are also pretty fantastic. If you think you don't like head cheese or liver pate, try the number one and get back to me. It's got both in spades and manages to stay delicious. The cilantro and veggies they toss on the sammich also balance it all into a harmonious French-Vietnamese delight.  Too bad it's in Chandler. The valley seriously needs more banh mi and less pho.

This was a great end to a dreary rainy gloomy draining no good very bad day!   A bottle (or two or five) of wine shared among friends, great food for us to nosh, and Thomas the quintessential host to keep the good times rolling.  And chilled Patron with fresh fruit? Why we must have left too early!

This is not a place for the calorie conscious, so dieters need to swear off this place like the plague. Even the salads here are smothered in bacon, eggs, cheese and dressing. But if you feel like punishing your arteries in the most delicious fashion, I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. I've heard from just about everyone I know that this place is the bee's knees, the elephant's eyebrows, the eel's hips...and the buzz wasn't wrong.   This place has some amazing hangover food, so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. The temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point, which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over, but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners didn't drop like flies before they could be served. Two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal, but my brain didn't feel like thinking yet. However, by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty, there were empty booths all over the place, so if you're impatient, go during the last hour they're open.  Once inside, we sat at the bar, right in the path of the air conditioning vent, with a clear view of the kitchen going ons. Seeing how I drank my share of water outside I ordered an RC Cola (I didn't even know that brand still existed!) that came in a can. While waiting to order, I did some pretty extreme rubbernecking, judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others. The menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible, and after watching everyone else I was pretty excited when the time came to order.   I decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare, so I could accurately compare it to other brunch joints: eggs over medium, bacon, hashbrowns and sour dough toast. The Hog and Chick!  And. It. Was. Heaven.  It's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be. The toast tasted freshly baked, doughy yet crisp, and was delicious dipped in my eggs. Thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth. The hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises, because they looked exactly like the ones I make in my own home, greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous. There was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there wasn't a lick of processed sugar added.   And everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter.  I only wish it were in Tempe instead of Phoenix, because I'd love to try the other menu offerings. It's cheap, delicious, friendly, and some of the best damn hang over food I have ever had.

Holy effin' eff! Best happy hour anywhere in the valley!   Challenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.  I'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now.   The other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples.   Since these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small.   Several of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails!   The waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, "It'll getcha drunk!"   The Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour.   Three dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!

Happy hour and the weekend brunch are the way to go at Ticoz!   Happy hour includes a pretty generous half-priced discount on specialty cocktails, wine, wells and drafts. For a high-falutin' happy hour barfly like myself, this is an ideal situation. The sangria is crazy delicious here, with three fancy pants fruity varieties. The passion fruit sangria is one of my faves since it's a more traditional take on sangria, although the watermelon blush and kiwi chard are close seconds. The margaritas and mojitos are also pretty ace, with fancy flavors like blood orange.  A couple of apps are also discounted during happy hour for five bucks each. The chile pulled pork soft tacos were so flippin' awesome and filling enough to serve as an entire meal. Their avocado crema and some other type of colorful drizzle atop the tacos were super tasty, as were the pickled onions. The corn crusted waffle fries are also super fantastic. Lettuce wraps, eh, just okay. Interesting ingredients like dried cherries, mango, pineapple, pepitas, and macadamia nuts, with a tangy vinaigrette that kept it from being sickly sweet (as the Fez lettuce wraps trend toward at times-- sorry Fez, still love you!)  The brunch is also a staple for our mimosa-imbibing crew. Two buck mimosas? Yes, please. They'll sub cran too if you prefer a poinsettia. The southwest eggs benedict are my weakness during brunch. Two perfectly poached eggs atop chorizo-lined cornmeal cakes, smothered in chipotle hollandaise. Holy fricken orgazmotron that meal is delicious.  I also like that I have yet to see children here. Ignore your howling crotch fruit for a morning and enjoy a mimosa or a specialty cocktail before noon. Makes life worth living.

I'm clearly more of a Food City consumer than an AJ's gal, but this place succeeds in making me feel like I not only can, but should splurge on a five dollar loaf of bread to go with the homemade soup I just whipped up for pennies. I can deal with the prices because this place is perfect for the occasional uber-specialty ingredients that I can't get anywhere else. Edible flowers for crystallizing, espresso powder for my meat rubs, fancy pants mushrooms, high quality chocolate, duck fat, mangosteens outside of an Asian grocer, the works.   It's also really great for picking up a couple of super fancy high end shots of liquor in the airplane bottles. Perfect for a cheapazoid like me that wants the occasional dash of St. Germain or Chambord but sure as hell isn't going to buy the whole bottle!  I've never encountered any sass here from any of the staff either, even when I show up looking like a barely thrown together trash person.

I've been going to the Roosevelt since just after it opened, and I'm extremely pleased to see how it's blossomed into such a lovely little bar with excellent patronage. My little boy's all growed up!  I have one reason that is the indisputable, unassailable, golden rationale for why you should visit the Roosevelt: SHARK BEER! So important it deserves both capitalization and idolization.  Distilled from the finest aquatic varieties and banned in all fifty states, its pale gold, opaque frothiness will lull you into a happy state of drunkenness and sociability. The Great White Northern is by far the finest beer to ever pass these lips. I've had the wine on occasion, but compared to the deliciosity that is Shark Beer, my only recollection is that it doesn't suck.  I regrettably haven't had the full Roosevelt experience, as I've never spent any moolah on the food there. Well, Mr. Man did order the four dollar peanuts once and I tried them. Yes. Four dollars. For a pile of peanuts. Weird thing is he thought they were worth every penny. Granted, they were huge, warm and tasty, but they're fucking four dollar peanuts! Aside from that, I've heard from a fair number of people that the food is delectable and worth the price, but I've never been in the munching mood here.   Happy hour is undoubtedly the best time to visit this little bastion of class and comfort in downtown Phoenix, and every time I have been here at this hour the bar has been packed with well dressed and business casual folks. Evenings are a bit more intimate with fewer people, but you're pretty much guaranteed a seat somewhere, or if you come with a group of friends (that's my shout out to the lovely Yelpers I met here recently!) there is ample space for your group to socialize.  When you go, check out the funky little door in the central room above the bathroom corridor, and then tell me just where you think it leads or what they're hiding up there. Is it a portal to another dimension? Do they keep some red headed stepchild up there? Or is this where people who try to skip out on their tabs are detained? The mystery brings my overactive imagination great joy. I also dig the naked lady checking out a passing train picture in the restroom, which is like, big enough to entertain company in.  My one gripe is that they keep it cold as a meat locker in there, and my little toesies need dethawing in the Arizona heat after I exit the building. And this pithy reason's got nothing on the Roosevelt. (And the SHARK BEER.)

I awake, wild eyed in a cold sweat, visions of caramel creme macaroons soliciting me like high class tricks in a whorehouse, Croque Monsieurs their swanky pimps, demanding payment for service. Essence strikes again. The only way to vanquish these dreams is to lunch here on a regular basis.   I've been here twice in the past week alone and I think I'm addicted. The atmosphere, product, service, and baked goods have seduced me with their simple elegance. The only gripe I possibly have about this place is the fact that the parking lot is the size of a matchbox, and with Sacks, Cafe Lalibella and Starbucks all occupying the same plaza, finding a place to park during the busy lunch rush is like simultaneously playing Tetris and Frogger.  The atmosphere at Essence is understated in its sophistication. Windows line the majority of the dining room, creating an inviting, open air feeling and the attached patio is charming. Strong earth toned colors and cute little origami flower bouquets grace the tables. Despite the small size of the establishment there are a variety of seating options for single patrons or small groups, and I've never seen people waiting for a table, even during their busiest Friday lunch rush.  A broad array of patrons frequent Essence including hipsters, young professionals, older adults in their power suits, and even a few elders. I haven't seen very many college kids, which may because the food isn't cheap and it's probably "weirder" than options on Mill's strip. But I dig the "weird" French inspired cuisine. It's decadent and I feel naughty eating it.  Everything I've eaten during lunch has been exceptional. The croque moniseur is far and away the best thing I've tried so far. A grilled sandwich with an egg washed top layer, thin sliced ham, creamy gruyere cheese and jalapenos. It's heavenly crunchy, just as the name suggests. The open face steak sandwich is tender delicious and smothered in buttery sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of bleu cheese crumbles as a savory accent. The layers of phyllo dough used in the spanakopita demonstrates some serious painstaking dedication to producing a good product, and the chopped Greek salad was phenomenal. Crispy cucumbers, bell peppers, kalmata olives, feta cheese and tomatoes that tasted like, well, actual tomatoes, for once. Something that you don't often find and an indication that Essence uses amazingly fresh organic product whenever possible. Even the side of potato salad with whole grain mustard was exceptional.  The offerings at their bakery are just as phenomenal as their lunch entrees. The caramel creme macaroon is seriously the most amazing sandwich cookie I've ever tasted, a perfect harmony between savory creme filling and sweet chewy wafers. The strawberry shortcake is amazingly fresh and light, if not a little hard to eat. And their white chocolate raspberry layer cake is the classiest Little Debbie-esque snack cake I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. One day I vow to pick up a box of "Tasty little treats" just so I can sample a cupcake and about three cookies without having to choose among all the desserts on display!  I highly recommend this place. Just don't be surprised if you develop an insatiable desire to consume Essence on a daily basis.

I find this place absolutely delicious, but rarely end up going there when the inevitable conversation arises: "Where do you want to go? I dunno. Where do you want to go?" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat.  If you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket.   While they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new.  For about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese.   Watching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever.   Their happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.  UPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu. The salmon trumps them all. Do it.

The BEAST! Embrace it.   The Beast is what you call the divey bar off to the right with pool tables and a killer jukebox. Full bar, full menu. Open late.  If you don't know, now you know.

Let me exalt your praises, Mucho Gusto. Don't blush darling. Our love will not remain in the shadows!   Do you remember the time that you almost tried to set my boyfriend on fire? You put on an amazing little impromptu firework show when your misters got into a fight with that pesky string of lights, but you were kind enough to quell our fear and try to erase that memory with free alcohol, you wily little minx. You needn't delete him from the equation. We're usually game for a three way with you, Mistress Gusto.  That was right when the two happiest hours in my otherwise hellacious day were coming to an end. You do know that between the hours of four and six, your warm embrace and sweet nectar are all I need to forget about the dramarama of the office. The memories of your hibiscus, tamarind and mango margaritas, frosty Dos XXs and generous glasses of sauvignon blanc bring a smile to my face, especially with a three dollar price tag.  And you're always very gracious when I graze freely on the chips and salsa when I'm feeling frugal. I don't know what combination of chili and spices you sprinkle on your toasty little delights, but they're positively divine. Although they can't even hold a candle to your tasty salsa.  To help keep me from acting like a lush, which would greatly embarrass me in your presence, you offer half price appetizers during happy hour. That guacamole of yours with the pomegranate seeds has a zesty twist, while your gigantic Mexican pizza and mountainous machaca nacho plate have lured large groups of my friends to your patio and bar on many an occasion. Sharing is caring, and you're trying to teach the world to be a better place, one shrimp cocktail at a time.   When I'm feeling like a nice lunch or dinner instead of our usual rendezvous, your pozole always brings me happiness, with snow white hominy afloat in a sea of green and lots of tortillas to sop up that goodness. Your Colorado Stew is likewise as delectable, as are the Mexican street tacos. I especially dig how you let me mix and match three tacos, so I can add a red chili pork taco and fried fish taco into the mix!  Your cute little bistro setting with the beaded lamps and cushy bench seating made a delightful setting for a first date, while your exemplary menu, service and specials has had me coming back ever since. It's a good thing I'm not the jealous type, because I want to share you with all of Tempe.

I think I'm in love. If I only lived closer to Downtown Phoenix, I'd leave my mark on the Lost Leaf in the form of a permanent intaglio of my ass cheeks on a bar stool.   It's tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar. It can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists, so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign. You definitely don't want to miss out on this place by becoming frustrated after fruitlessly ducking down side streets, saying fuck it and going to The Roosevelt. While it wouldn't be a total bust, you'd be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the Lost Leaf.  That's really what won me over about this bar. It made me feel downright cozy, with exposed brick and wood, local artist's artwork decorating the walls, and the actual kitchen serving as the bar. The main room is large enough to host a large group, but small enough to be homey. The acoustics are very good (soft talkers rejoice!) and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood, but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation. There are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation, as well as an outdoor patio that's a little on the small side but, super score--there's ceiling fans!  I found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful. There are no beers on tap here, but the selection of bottles is mind bogglingly extensive. I had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and I ended up finding out that I am also in love with a brew called 1664. Looks like a wine cooler, but manages to be respectable instead of laughable.  So bring a couple friends with you and indulge one night, and then another, and another. You'll be love struck too.

I know I'm going to loose me some cool points for this one, but I feel no shame at all in shouting, "I LOVE MONKEY PANTS!"   Besides, if the Time Out Lounge crowd could even hear me at the other end of the parking lot, they'd probably just assume I was being snarky and ironic. I mean, who the hell frequents a bar named Monkey Pants? Do they have children in tow? Is there a petting zoo on the premises? Because it sounds like a Barney-Raffi-Teletubby-Wiggles sing-a-long title, not a place where adults go to get blotto.   Oh yeah? Well what's in a name? That which we call cheap fucking drinks by any other name would still get us loaded. And who are you to argue with Shakespeare? He hates your crappy emo poems anyway.  Huh. I guess I didn't know how strongly I felt about Monkey Pants until that verbal vomit just came spewing forth.  As a gesture of goodwill to those of you who I know I'll see at Time Out in the future, and will undoubtedly rib me for my irrational love of a place called Monkey Pants, I will concede the following point: it is most definitely not an evening drinking destination.   It is an excellent happy hour or weekend day drinking joint though. Discount 2.25 well and 1.75 domestic drafts between 5 and 7 (that only increase by a buck at regular prices)? Hell yes. An unlimited fount of free popcorn good for munching and launching? Check. An entire menu of good bar food if you're looking to absorb some of the alcohol sloshing around? You betcha. One of the best waitresses/bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of tipping? Thanks for consistently getting me drunk, Krista!   There's pool, shuffle board, trivia cards, board games, kitschy paintings, a fake fireplace playing on loop, leg lamps, and enough televisions to send you into a pop culture coma with their soft, hypnotizing glow. This is the type of place where I can show up at five and drink straight through to ten or later without even knowing it, and thankfully, without even coming close to breaking the bank.   I've been around for the "wacky" antics that others have brought up as negative (one o'clock shirtless shots, fish races, and thematic discounts--moustache Monday and wig Wednesday, and so on) but hardly anyone participates. And I've never been to Monkey Pants when it's exuded a "frat bar atmosphere." Come during happy hour and you're more likely to see the local flavor propped up around the island bar (I dig an island bar) than the kind of people barhopping down the Mill Avenue strip. There's just enough buffer room to keep them at bay.  So if you're comfortable enough to put aside pretension and indulge in a little kitsch, I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon!  And if that doesn't convince you, maybe these six little words will:  Bacon. Wrapped. Deep. Fried. Hot. Dog.  A nacho cheese covered coronary on a bun. I never knew death could taste so delicious.

I have been frequenting Wild Roots since it opened. (And following my fave hair maven since before she worked here!) The salon itself is very bright and open. Modern, colorful, classy and clean. Complimentary coffee, tea and water, as per usual. Tons on magazines to browse for coif inspiration. It can trend a little bit on the pricey side, but be savvy about what you want and how to package it. And don't cheap out on the tip! These ladies and gents deserve it!  I can't review this place without mentioning my absolute savior of hair, Brook. She's an amazing stylist that does a bang up job interpreting what you want based on a picture or even a couple buzz words (layering, fringe, chunky funky bangs). She has never failed to shape my 'do into a mini masterpiece.

I snub my nose at you zealous purists out there. I like my cheese steaks bastardized. Hold your cheese whiz. Drop the beef and toss on some chicken. And make sure to add vegetables. Yes, vegetables. Blasphemy, I know. Give me mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes. Mmmm. In fact, you could even hold the meat and I would be alright with that.   The hot sandwiches at Corleone's are a happy medley of these two extremes. For the purists, there's the Philly Original and for us West Coast blasphemers there's everything from Buffalo Chicken to Veggie Subs. The fries are pretty decent (it takes some real effort--or neglect--to fuck up french fries) but the onion rings leave a lot to be desired.    I've tried a couple different hot sandwiches, including the Philly Original, and it's always a greasy, messy event. The majority of the time the juice and grease of the contents melt right through the damn roll, leaving me with a pile of napkins, a mangled sandwich, and a frown on my face. (I really dislike it when my food falls apart. I usually bite of it as hard as I can to try and inflict pain on the offending meal. The food has never acknowledged my attack. It's a pretty irrational tradition.) So if keeping your sandwich in one edible piece is big in your book, I wouldn't recommend this place.   The actual restaurant is pretty small, with a long bar with stools and several high tables to enjoy your vittles at. It's also a little bit on the hot side since half of the restaurant is the kitchen, and it gets a bit noisy with all the ordering, grilling and chit chat, but it's a really lively atmosphere and they offer delivery or take out if you're in a hurry. They're open really late too, especially on the weekends, in order to cater to the Mill Avenue night life.  On Tuesdays they have a special that's pretty ace. It's a buy one get one deal on any sandwich in the place--of equal or lesser value (just imagine that in small print)--so you and a friend can eat for cheap or you've got one sandwich for dinner and another for lunch the next day.  I know a lot of people that adore this place, but it's just not my thing. Cheese steaks are not the food of gods to me, but if the thought of hot beef and cheese whiz has you gargling saliva like Homer Simpson, you'll probably enjoy it and rate it higher.

Dear Macayo's,   I would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland, artery busting Meximerican food. I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.  I will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.  Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.  The food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a duck working in your favor.   I do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante "New York City?!" commercials.   I also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's?   I'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling "Baja sauce", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker guac. You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of cilantro or lemon juice, no hint of Serrano spiciness, not even the tang of some onion, although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color.   I don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in cream cheese. I know you're into that freaky shit.  Wishing you deep fried broken dreams, Erica

If you're looking for a dive bar without the skeeze layered on thick, consider this gem.   I know, why call it a dive if there aren't painted-up hussies propped on bar stools and you're not afraid to contract something lasting from touching the bathroom features? Because it's more like that neglected house down the street owned by the Cat Lady that has chipped paint and an overgrown yard, but when you stop there on Halloween she always has those awesome popcorn balls. Or that ottoman that's a little frayed around the edges and is patched with duct tape to keep the upholstery skirt on, but it's the comfiest damn foot rest.   Despite the looks, the bar is a local watering hole that attracts your quirky neighbors. Someone brought in the pelt of a javelina they'd shot the day prior to show it off to his buddies. Ever seen one of those ugly things up close? You just might get the chance if you decide to check it out. Chuy's two doors down will serve as a neon-lit mecca for mass consumption, while Baseline Pub will remain the watering hole in the wall that's a little more mellow and a little rougher around the edges.  Happy hour is twelve hours long, from ten to ten, so they don't really have any drink specials, but the prices are cheap so that's not really an issue. Plus there's the requisite pool tables that every good dive has, so you've got something to occupy your time in addition to conversation with the locals.  The down side is that the mixed drinks are a bit on the weak side, so stick with beer. The music selection kind of sucks at times, with either country western or classic rock playing. (Cross your fingers for the classic rock.) The waitresses are pretty inattentive as well, so make sure there aren't any lapses in conversation, because silence sure drags long without something to quench your thirst.

It goes by many names. Boba tea, bubble tea... Well maybe just two names. It's really the texture that's more up for debate. Melty gelatinous gummy balls that are sproingy on the teeth is one way to describe it. Black phlegmatic chunks of mucous laden smokers lung is another. It's all about perspective.  I happen to like the gooey little pearls that collect at the bottom of milky green tea, and Eba Cafe is the best place in the valley to indulge. They used to be located just north of ASU and I would pop in before classes, until one day they vanished without a trace. I was adrift without my convenient bubbly study break fare, but as fate would have it, I was stuck in gridlock on Broadway and what should mine eyes behold? A bright red "Eba" in a strip mall across from the dairy plant.   What a sweet reunion it was! Jelly goodness afloat in milky green or black tea with one of thirty-some possible flavors added!   The black and green tea are traditional stand-bys, but if you're feeling daring, try the wintermelon tea. It has no sugar added but the natural sugar is so incredibly potent that I couldn't finish a thimble full sample without experiencing the puckered, day-uuum-that's-sweet face. After you've chosen your tea, try to narrow down the flavor additives, red bean is a solid choice but watermelon is my ultimate trump card. Mango, taro and honeydew are also pretty tasty. Then decide if you want some kind of gelatinous goop added to your drink. They have several different types including boba and coffee jellies, which I've heard are great in, well, coffee drinks.  Eba also has some light lunch and munch options if you feel like nibbling. I've had the green curry chicken bowl, which is earthy with a nice spice, but the accompanying rice was a little dried out. If you're just there for a snack, try the brick toast with coconut. Delish! They also serve gelato, but between you and me, it looked kinda nast. Eba should just stick with what it does best, wicked good tea with lovely little snot balls.

Huge expansion. Decent selection of foods! Huge selection of craft beers to add to their pre-tap days offerings. And plenty of live music without a cover (usually). All without sacrificing the dive bar atmosphere.

I have an entire box of conversation hearts left over from Valentine's Day and these little morsels are going to be the inspiration for this review. Let the taste of cherry flavored death and pastel sidewalk chalk begin!  "My man" and I decided to join a group of ten at C4 last night to enjoy the company of a quirky group of "romeo"s and "dream girl"s and sample the new Southwest inspired menu at C4.  I was impressed at "how nice" the decor was in the main dining area, since I had previously only frequented the bar and sampled some of the wretched Japanese inspired bar food. It's nice to see a restaurant "wise up" and invest a little "tlc" into reworking its image, as well as its menu. I thought that the bold, colorful Mexican centerpieces and hanging crystal light pieces were "tres chic" and when I saw the same strong use of color duplicated on the chair backs it was "true love" for me. I wanted to steal all the light fixtures, knick-knacks and tall chairs for my own home.  It was Valentine's Day and I had to order something to drink that was as frou frou and girly as my polka dot party dress, because when "ur a qt" you simply have to be sipping something just as ultra-femme. So I went for the Prickly (pear) Peach Martini and was not disappointed by its "sweet," pulpy, hot pink contents.  For apps, we ordered two platters of the tri-colored chips with three dips and the crab cakes. When it came to the dips, there was "one I love"d, the napolito corn salsa. The other two, guacamole and pico de gallo, "I hope" get better with time because the pico was bland and the guacamole was so overpowered by lime juice that it was nigh on inedible. The crab cakes on the other hand "I'm sure" I would order again because there was a good crab to filler ratio and a pleasant spicy kick delivered by the chipotle remoulade.   "Lover boy" and I split the bacon cheeseburger and the chorizo mac and cheese for dinner, both of which I wanted to be "all mine" because they were so good I didn't want to share a single bite with "my baby." I was hoping the burger would "be good" but I wasn't expecting it to be cooked to perfection and served with crisp tomatoes and a lovely pile of spring mix instead of some of the more lowly greens available. It also came with a side of fries that were more like munching on a plank of potato if you "ask me." And feel free to "call me" crazy, but they must have sprinkled "stardust" on the chorizo mac and cheese because it was out of this world good! You could ask any of the three people that ordered it at our table if that's too good to "be true" and I'm sure you'd receive the same response as mine. Spicy, tender homemade chorizo was afloat in three types of decadent cheesy bliss!  We ended the night with two dessert sampler platters, and if you have more than at least three people at the table, I highly suggest you take "time out" of your evening to indulge because it was "way" good. I am in "love" with two of the desserts in specific, the frozen key lime tart and the Mexican chocolate flourless cake. The key lime tart was "cool" and citric and I let it melt in my mouth like a bite of sorbet with a graham cracker crust and tasty little candied lime zest. The "cutie pie" slice of Mexican chocolate flourless cake was rich and dense with a deep cocoa flavor and a hint of spiciness at the end that "let it be" a bit more unpredictable and memorable than regular chocolate desserts. The borracho bread pudding wasn't as drunk as its name suggested (or as pudding-y) and the 7 layer chocolate cake was the same "you & me" could get the valley over.   The waitress we had was an "angel." She was extremely knowledgeable about all of the dishes on the menu and went so far as to open a dialogue with the chef when a member of our party needed a vegetarian, lactose free meal (who could that possibly be? ":)" ). I "loved her," and even though service was a little bit scattered, I attribute that more to having to deal with drink orders and food delivery at the same time (for a pretty big group) than any kind of slacking. It wasn't perfect and could definitely use some refining, but since that was the only minor hang-up in the evening, I'm going to "let it be" forgotten.  "I do" think C4 has the possibility of becoming a five star dining experience. It just needs a bit of polishing!  Don't agree? "Fax me." (Sorry, I just had to include the most ridiculously out of date conversation heart saying in the history of Necco. The rest of them were just too ordinary.)

Confession time, I don't really like barbeque. It's sweet and vinegary and weird and ruins perfectly good smoked meat. But the last two times I've been out for this kind of food, I have been pleasantly surprised. Maybe as I age my appreciation for tangy tomato sugar paste matures. I'm a classy broad like that. Or maybe I just need to frequent places that know how to serve up barbeque right, and that's exactly what Urban Campfire does.  They couldn't have chosen a better location for the restaurant, within walking distance of the University, and I'm wicked pleased that nasty fucking Greasy Tony's finally crawled into its dingy little hole and died. I don't even want to know how much cleaning they had to undertake in order to reincarnate the tiny little shithole as a sparkling and inviting little diner.   After swinging by this little place on a Monday night to see it closed, I was bummed and a little skeptical that it would be open at 8:00 on a Sunday evening. The neon sign was beckoning me to enter, but the chairs had already been stacked against the front windows and it looked like they were doing the ohgodit'sslowpleasecanwegohome prolonged breakdown, so Mr. Man went and peeked his head in to inquire if they were still able to do a take out order. Oh yeah, it was smoked meat time.   The menu had all sorts of delicious sounding sandwiches and the barbeque staples, and most of it was heavy on the meat, so keep the veg heads away from this butcher shop or they'll be forced to nibble on the sides. The server couldn't have been more personal and engaging as we chatted about the menu offerings and details about the new place. After listening to her recommendations I ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich with beans for $7.95, while Mr. Man got the half rack of ribs with beans and fries.   She was chatting up a storm with us about how good the food was and even gave us a sample of their special of the day, Sloppy Joes, which was bangin'! I had no idea sloppy joes could possibly shake their Manwich stigma, but the meat was tender and spiced just right and I can't even explain it. It was off the hook good and it was a fucking spoonful of sloppy joes. I still can't wrap my head around it.   Once our orders were up we trotted home and dug into massive amounts of mouthwatering good barbeque. The sauce wasn't overly vinegary or tomatoey or sweet, and all the flavors complemented one another and lovingly embraced my porky goodness. Three huge sliders were included in my order, the buns were soft as marshmallow fluff and the beans, oh, the beans! Crispy little strips of bacon high fived my beanie little friends to double team the flavor factor. The ribs were HUGE and were definitely the stand out entree ordered. They were smoked on the premises, nicely charred and melt off the bone tender. The dogs agree with me, even though they just got the bones. Beware the french fries. They're limp since they're freshly cut and fried. But they were smothered in fresh garlic, so I found a way to overlook that little deterrent.   They also have a ton of drink specials, from the tried and true bottle of domestic brew to funky flavored sangrias. And although I didn't try it, their dessert is a haystack cookie made of pretzel sticks, mini marshmallows, peanut butter and butterscotch sauce and they sound like something I would have made when I was too young to use the stove so I was dependent on the microwave for making chex mix and shit on a shingle. (I had a Jell-o cook book as a kiddo and tried just about every recipe in there, including the nasty mixed vegetables suspended in unflavored gelatin and beef stock. Weird.) They're also in the process of creating a patio out front where you can enjoy a picnic like atmosphere with the food to complement it.   So I guess I have to revise my opening statement. I'm a recovering barbeque-phobe, and this cheap as sin, make me groan with pleasure barbeque joint will definitely be worked into the regular rotation.  Since I haven't eaten there more than once, I'm giving it four stars, but if it continues to be this awesome, it'll be a five star joint for me!

From time to time I find myself wandering into Headquarters after placing an order at El Pollo Supremo. They've got a great selection of smoking accoutrement, hookah stuff (their shisha's supposedly really good), and lots of fun merch. Since I'm no longer pursuing an undergraduate degree in anthropology, I really don't have any reason to frequent a headshop. (Minds out of the gutter, it was ethnographic research...honest.) But it's a fun way to pass the time if you find yourself in this plaza with an extra couple of minutes.  There's always some kind of deal going on with the non-smoke merchandise. Buy one get one posters/sunglasses/shirts/etc. The same thing can be said for the pipes and such but I've failed to take notice of what exactly they were. If nothing else, you should stop by just to see some of the showpieces they have on display. Some of them are so intricate that I have a really hard time believing they're blown glass!  Most of their merchandise is a bit classier than the Rastachouli garbage you'll pay out the nose for at the smokeshops on Mill. No fantasy land dragon-shaped ashtrays and forty dollar tie dyed tees. (Although there will always be the requisite Marley merchandise!) I've bought a pair of nice sunglasses here for dirt cheap in the past and some of their apparel is pretty reasonably priced.  Compared to the competition up Mill, this place has a really good vibe going. Trails and Hippie Gypsy often reek so hard of nag champa and corporate shame that it's hard to stomach them, even at passing whiff. This place is really bright and colorful, managing to steer clear of the burnout/aging hippie vibe. Way classier than the liquor-porn-a-crack-pipe palooza that is DJ's and other smaller dingy shops. The staff is really helpful as well, managing to be present and ready without being overly intrusive and dead set on the sell.   So if you're checking out Eastside Records or waiting for your chicken order next door, swing by Headquarters. You might be presently surprised.

I live a stone's throw from this Safeway and never end up here for groceries. Based on experience, if I cart my lazy ass down to the Fry's at Thomas and 44th, I end up spending about 1/4 less on my shopping trip than I do at this Safeway. Everything is ridiculously expensive, even after the "club card" savings.   I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection? Or maybe it's the added cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-check out lanes. Do I really have to stand in line for ten minutes behind a suburbanite with 2.5 screaming childes just to buy a couple sticks of buttah?   And I understand carding, but do you really have to whip out the book to copy down my info and then make me sign my name like three times because my 16-year old self's signature doesn't match my 27 year-old scrawl? Come on, now. That's excessive. I appreciate that you think I'm looking foxy young for my age, but I'd rather hit up the crack pipe-selling liquor paloozas along McDowell than deal with this nonsense.  Unless I am in desperate need of an ingredient *stat* or require something special like their amazing Mediterranean olive selection, I'm staying far, far away.

Every time I go waltzing around The District (ahem, twice) I make sure to stop by this hidden gem for some extreme iced tea action. I use extreme in the sense that there's 100s of options that all end in AWESOME. White peach iced AWESOME, iced pomegran-AWESOME, four AWESOME berry tea, creme brulAWESOME. And those are just the flavors I've sampled. I could be "The Richmeister" from SNL while lavishing praises upon these teas.  Going with the white peach-a-rino, iced pomegrana-rama-ding-dong, the creme brulee-ster, four berries? Berry nice. Makin' the copies...  But I digress.  Tea Infusion has an awesome location in terms of drawing in business, so all you naysayers that are poo pooing its place nestled among chain stores can just shut it. From a business perspective it makes perfect sense. People get thirsty when shopping, especially in the desert, and this place appears like an oasis on the horizon. If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up. So I'd rather laud the smarts of a business man who broke through the corporate mold and managed to offer an independent and hip lil tea shop amid the brand name wasteland that is Tempe Marketplace than complain about it.   It's so nice to step into this place, breath a sigh of relief and shake off the oppressive crowd of consumers (and anklebiters) waiting just outside that door, especially if it's a weekend evening. And I've got to say that a nice cuppa makes the window shopping, caterwauling live band, and gaggles of giggling adolescents much more enjoyable.  Aside from a tea selection that puts China Mist to shame, they offer some munchitos that I've never indulged in like sandwiches, sides and scrumptious looking desserts. One day, Tea Infusion, one day.  The only complaint I have is with the staff.   I understand you don't make much and sometimes customers are devilish. I've been a barista before. But that's no excuse to neglect your customers or the cleanliness of your establishment. I went on a Saturday night and one chick was very loudly and obnoxiously chatting up a customer, leaving her coworker to fall behind when handling group after group of people by his lonesome. The counter was filthy and cluttered with tea paraphernalia, smoothie stuff, dirty steeping devices, and milk that someone had neglected to put back in the refrigerator. I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind.   I get the disenfranchisement you feel when being paid slightly over minimum wage, but have a little respect for customer service and the integrity of your shop or you won't have one to report to for long.

I've been having a run of really bad lunch destinations in the past week.   I was craving Mexican food earlier this week and a coworker had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree at Qdoba. Now I'm not really sure what an entree consists of at a place where everything is ordered a la carte, but figured that a burrito was as good a guess as any, so I opted for the pork.  Now, according to their menu this pork had been simmered in a blend of tangy tomatillos, jalapenos, garlic and lime juice...and their marketing division deserves props for that appetizing description, because it's all a smoke and mirror act. It tasted like pork. Plain old pork. Very tender pork, but straight up pork all the same.  Add cilantro lime rice (uh, plain ole white rice with specks of green?); black beans (at least they didn't try anything pretentious there); pico de gallo (some of the blandest tomatoes and onions to ever grace a burrito); roasted chile corn salsa (for real, now? because I couldn't taste a hint of pobalano chile or jalapeno); and salsa roja (writing it in Spanish makes it more authentic. duh.), and wrap it up in a tortilla with a diameter the width of your torso. What do you get? A bland 3,000 calorie monstrosity of a burrito that needs to be dressed up with guacamole, cheese and lots of salsa to make it edible, if not very palatable.  We got the food to go and the bag for our two burritos felt like the bottom was going to fall out. Out of curiosity, I weighed the burrito when we got back to the lab. It was over 610.00 grams because my electronic scale recorded the weight as "Err," and that's its max limit. That's over 1 pound and 5.43 ounces for you non-metric folk out there. Or if you prefer to express its weight more figuratively, it was the size and weight of a bunny, but didn't taste nearly as good. (Conejos son muy sabrosos!)  I've also tried two tacos (pork and beef, see above for insight into the caliber of ingredients) and the three chile queso dip with chips. It was, to put it mildly, a disappointment.   But if you're looking for a sterile, fast food environment (seriously, if Chipotle is owned by McDonald's...who owns this joint?) where you can take bland, picky eaters to enjoy burritos that constitute more than your entire recommended daily allowance of calories in one fell swoop, hit up Qdoba. With that info in mind, you won't be disappointed!

You know what differentiates a lot of tomato based Mexican food from fucking Italian? Oregano and basil, both of which were in your "hot" salsa today. I put quotation marks around that because I guess it was supposed to be spicy but it tasted more like sloppy joe mix than chiles. I didn't ask for a freakin' Mexitalian burrito.  Consistently the worst pseudo-Mexican food in the business.   The best thing that can be said for it is it'll form a turd. Pure fuel, not food.

The word that most aptly describes the Sneaker's experience:  Eww.  This exclamation should be accompanied by a scrunched up nose, sneer or depressed sigh depending on the intonation.  Does the smell of open sewage wafting from the bathrooms entice your tastebuds? Eww! *scrunchy nose*  Do shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*  Does the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*  I live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: "Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?"  Most frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.  I wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.  That leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed.   It seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.  The service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch.   The decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.  They've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe.   If you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.

Mind-boggling rhetorical question of the day: Who on earth chooses to have their bachlorette party dinner at Lucille's?   My down home girlie girl, who, bless her sweet heart and wonderbread palate, absolutely adores this joint.   To start, the service was absolutely atrocious. Party of eight on a Friday night. Annoying? I can see how it could be. More annoying? Losing the reservation and shoving us into a corner designed to seat five, maybe six max. A bunch of elbow bumping, scantily clad chicks all dolled, sipping fruity ass hurricanes and the like. Probably pretty humorous to observe. Not so humorous to navigate.  Put on your woo-girl face though because this is a par-tay! Woo!  Bring out the mildly scandalous goodie bags filled with penis lollipops, dirty fortune cookies and flavored lube (i.e. the tame stuff). Just scandalous enough send your Great Aunt Esther into a conniption fit. Seriously, if this was the genuine highlight of this meal, it really does not speak highly of the hot garbage being slopped on a plate at Lucille's. Woo!  And we wait, and wait, and wait.   Bread, finally! Woo!  Wait, are you sure you didn't confuse biscuits with hard tack? Because not even the scrumptious honey butter you've got is worth the dental bills incurred from teething this rock.   Again we wait, and wait, and wait.   Pulled pork! Woo!  Hold up. How does a pulled pork sandwich manage to be incredibly greasy and dry as a bone at the same time? Have I slipped into some alternative dimension? Is it opposite day? Because if so, this shit is finger-lickin' good. You best slop on that BBQ sauce to add some semblance of flavor to the sandwich and hope it doesn't soak through the bun in 2.5 seconds flat. Worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. Hands down. The garlicky mashed potatoes as a side were the only saving grace of the meal.  I seriously have no idea how this place stays in business. If it were not for the over abundance of low swingin' crotch fruit I brought to the party, dinner here would have tanked, hard and fast. It was awkward, drawn out (3 hours!) and ridiculously expensive. The best part about the experience was walking out the door. Woo!

Cheeburger, Cheeburger!  It's a restaurant called Cheeburger, Cheeburger!!  The little kid in me squealed with delight.   Like pasghetti and sammiches, cheeburgers are one of those willfully mispronounced foodstuffs that bring back a little nostalgia. They remind me of those rare days when we'd all pile in my chain smoking babysitter's Caddy and cruise to McD's for cheeburgers, cheapo happy meal toys, and a romp in the pee covered ball pin.   Urine, second hand smoke, and cheeburgers. I couldn't fathom a better combination at that age.  Then again we didn't have Cheeburger, Cheeburgers when I was a kid. If we did I'd be eating my kid's meal out of a super sweet pink hot rod that looks almost identical to the Barbie mobile, sippin' my hand shaken soda and munchin' on a cheeburger, American, ketchup. I'm in my twenties but I still wanted one of those little card stock car boxes, even if my taste in toppings has become a bit more adventurous.  Just because my tastebuds have matured doesn't make me any more decisive now than I was then. Not a good thing with a place that boasts 50 or so toppings for you burger (or chicken sandwich, or salad-- they're all based on the same "every order is a special order" model). I didn't even attempt to figure out what kind of fancy pants shake or soda flavor I wanted (100 flavors, people! 100!!) and just kept it simple with a glass of water in a mason jar. The fries vs. onion rings debate was also too heated, but a basket of crisp and delicious frings came to the rescue. The onion rings were thin and lightly battered, definitely the better of the two options, and the fries were fresh cut and uber greasy, just how I like 'em, even if they were under-salted.  In the end I went with a Classic green chile cheddar burger with the traditional fixins (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, ketchup). It was cooked to a perfect medium and the price was right, ringing in at about 5 bucks. I agree that the top bun was way too big in comparison to the bottom, but I solved that by shaving half of it off so I could wrap my mouth around that thick slab of meat, because let's face it people, the bun is just filler. It's all about the meat. It was messy and juices were dripping all over my face, and I must have gone through at least four paper towels, but hot diggity damn, it was a great burger.  The smallest burger possible (the Classic) is about five ounces or so and they increase incrementally until you reach the big mamba jamba 20 ounce 'nother nail in the coffin coronary on a bun. I can't even guess how many pieces of cheese it takes to cover that beast. I did however witness two people finish this outrageous burger while I was enjoying my dainty (by comparison) fare. Both gastric champions had their pictures taken with a gigando stuffed cheeburger (I would have worn it as a hat), and then had their image pasted on the wall of shame...err...fame.  My inner child's parting words are: "Cheeburger! Cheeburger! Go eat cheeeeeburgerrrrrs!"  My more mature counterpart: "Ahem, a myriad of combinations are possible between burgers, shakes and sides, variety enough to satisfy even the most discerning of palates and leave everyone...CHEEBURGER!!!"  P.S. Fuck Red Robin in its bony little chicken wing. This place is miles ahead of that bland dump.

I am a hummus fiend. I have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. I will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. Don't even get me started on baba ghanoush.  So it's almost a guarantee that I will like anything that draws upon a Mediterranean flavor palate.   Med Fresh is no exception.  It's technically Turkish, but I don't split hairs when it comes to Mediterranean. The pitas are fresh and flavorful, the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat (beef and chicken) are always moist and delicious. Everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen. The staff can be a bit terse at times but they're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush.   The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive, and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion, the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender. If you simply can't be pressed to make up your mind, go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety.   The pita sammich special (#16) is the best bang for your buck on the menu. Pita, meat, tomato, lettuce, weird pickles and secret sauce. Served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. Salad or fries on the side. $6.95.   Oh yeah.

I don't know how I ended up at this place. I blame in on serious hunger-starved delusions that the Caddy Ranch may have changed for the better since my last visit.    The food is mediocre and kind of overpriced for the fare. If you're looking to Caddy it up on the cheap, check out the lunch specials on the weekend or the happy hour deals during the week. If you discount the tchotchke TGI-Chili-Bee's atmosphere, it can be a pretty decent happy hour or football destination if that's your bag.  The appetizer sampler is on par for bar food and a pretty good deal for the price. The sliders are disappointing in terms of size and flavor, but the fries they come with are pretty tasty. Onion rings are grease-heavy and came out cold. Whatevs. The food really isn't the issue I have with this place. It's probably a two stars for the food alone, "Meh. I've experienced better."  What pushes this into the dud pile: Crap wait staff that doesn't seem to give a flying rats ass about your table. Straight up grody cocktail combinations that left us feeling like we were about to go into a sugar coma. The seedy vibe at the nightclub coupled with a cover to get in. And the fact that the mechanical bull is like, never on. The night life is really a little slice of the West Side in Tempe. As a reformed G-town resident, I really need to keep away or risk slipping back into my trash person ways.  Nyet. Nyet. Nyet. Three strikes and you're out, Caddy.

Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)  It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory?   So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate ("Um, I don't eat anything green...") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.  The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal.   Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours.   Let's wrap it up: -Don't bring picky eaters. -Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill. -Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours. -Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun. -Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)  I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.

I use this place for all my health issues, from lady bits to kidney stones. The front office staff is courteous and friendly. The nurse practitioners professional and personable.   I never have to wait very long to get an appointment to see the doc and once I arrive and sign in it's a pretty quick turn around. No waiting in a smelly front office for hours. The front office section is modern and bright with lots of comfy chairs. The ubiquitous magazine selection is pretty well stocked and some kiddy toys are around if you got ankle biters in tow.   Dr. Anne-Marie Reed has a wonderful demeanor with patients. She spends plenty of time addressing your needs and suggesting solutions. In addition to addressing the problem at hand, she makes sure to inquire into everyday lifestyle choices (without being nosy, preachy or judgmental about it) and offers suggestions for ways to live healthier. Improving community health starts at the individual level and knowledge is power, so go Dr. Reed!  If you do need a prescription for something, she doesn't push the hard sell on a name brand drug (unless that's the only option of course), and has always offered a generic alternative than runs me less than ten bucks at Walgreens.   The only gripe I have is that they play pseudo-news (FOX) in the lobby and I have to listen to fear mongering before I get in to see the doc. (But then again, this is Arizona.) I think the tiny candy bowl on the way out more than makes up for it though!

Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's.   I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.  Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm.   Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it.   Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.  Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.  Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price.   Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's.   My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce.   Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise.   Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.  So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison.   Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.  Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling.   I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing.   I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.

I sat in the waiting room for three hours and watched a Packers playoff game while dude almost died of pneumonia in the back. Took an hour for him to be seen and almost two hours for treatment. Everyone else was in and out in a fraction of the time compared to my walking corpse though so he's a special case. Smelled super funny but you get used to it. TV reception ain't great--I believe they use a paper clip chain as an antenna? But hey they're open late and on Sundays so what can you do.

Love, love, love A Taste of the Caribbean! The braised oxtails are heavenly, succulent and fall off the bone tender. They had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal. The plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides, and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce.   The jerk chicken was also fantastic, but since I was so busy hoarding my oxtails I didn't get to try much of it. The jerk was smoky, spicy, and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it. Same sides, so at least we didn't have to fight over those.   Make sure to try the hibiscus flower drink (sorrel) with cloves floating in it. It accompanies the earthy, spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at Mexican joints.  The atmosphere of this place is wonderfully warm and inviting. The eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the Caribbean, and the faux-rattan chairs help with the vibe too. There's also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place, but who am I to judge decor? Nothing in my house matches.   In that respect it's kind of like being invited over to a friend's house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your Kraft mac n cheese house. It's clearly a family owned joint with all ages bumming around the kitchen. Kiddos bring out water, adolescents with hip hop ring tones take your order, and the matriarchs keep them all in line. It's energetic and engaging and utterly delicious.   Next time I need leave room for the cassava or coconut cake! (Much harder to do than you may think. Trust me.)  Oh, they also have some interesting breakfast options like smoked fish and such. Don't worry, they also have regular old eggs on the menu. Check it out one morning for something outside of the norm!

This place needs some love, yo. Not the four to five star reviews saying "Yay!" and then never visiting the place again. I'm talking a serious customer base that will elevate this unique little Hawaiian joint to the level it deserves.   It's completely different from any other Hawaiian food out there. Honestly, most of that island fare is kind of bland by my standards. Bland macaroni salad, bland rice, bland pulled pork. Blah, blah, blah.  Maui Dog turns all these tired standards on their nose and tosses some wicked ridiculous flavor combos together. Who would have thought that a sweet pineapple and coconut slaw would have worked so well on dawgs and sliders? The aioli and shaggy-style island dog are also pretty fantastic.   Plus they have Spam. SPAM! I love my pre-formed, processed pork products. Mmm hmm.   Also a big fan of the fries and tater tots. (Everywhere should offer the far superior tot as an option in my opinion.) They are a bit soggy instead of super crisp, but I'm one of those queer birds that just loves soggy taters. Grease esssplosion in yo mouth!  They have a drive-thru! They take cards! The guy that owns the place is hella nice and will chat your ear off! It's colorful! And different! But not so different that it's pretentious and annoying! I can't offer any more justifications. Get your ass to Maui Dog. Amazing doesn't do it justice.

It was like some warped social experiment to see how long tables would wait to receive their order before cutting their losses and calling it quits. Maybe the Psych Department at ASU rented it out for an afternoon and we were the guinea pigs.   Instead of going on a subjective rant, I'll try and let the facts of our experience speak: -We did not see our waitress the entire time. -Some guy took our order to "help out with the food order." He seemed like a manager since he was the absolute, only person in the restaurant moving quickly and with purpose. -We waited 40 minutes with a couple glasses of water and no food.  -We flagged down a waitress (unknowing if it was ours or not) occasionally to inquire, and were placated to wait "just a little longer" each time. -Eventually, we had to leave hungry because it was a work day and we were under time constraints. -Two other tables that came in after us were served long before this 40 minute mark.  Observations of how other tables were treated during this 40 minute tease (and it's grim): -A four-top next to us spent 10 minutes settling the bill, because of an mind-blowing break down in communication that resulted in black books going back-and-forth-and-back-again a ridiculous number of times. -About eight plates were sent back to the kitchen because the orders were wrong. -The hostess had a reuben with pasta salad and spent a couple minutes wandering aimlessly for its home, asking numerous tables if it was theirs. (Not the only incidence of this happening.) -We observed two other tables of business casual individuals leave before their food had a chance to arrive, for (what we can only assume was) the same reason that we had to. -The hostess had to ask a four-top of people that already had drinks and some food to move to a different location in the restaurant in order to accommodate another party that just entered. -People began to pile up at the door to be seated and had to wait it out. Some just left. -The hostess began seating people with the warning that "The kitchen is like, really, super backed up right now, so it'll be like, 30-40 minutes to get your food. Is that okay?" (Would have been nice to get that warning and avoid the experience.) -The wait staff just kind of ran around like (well-intentioned) chickens with their heads cut off. Lots of panic, not much action. -Several tables were left un-bussed for a pretty long spell. -There was one woman (seemed like management) that just kind of moseyed all over the place without doing anything other than fill a couple water glasses. -We didn't see the manager again. (Probably a good thing since the kitchen was so backed up, but placating a restless public would have been smart too.)  Why I don't understand the clusterduck: -It's prepped sandwich ingredients. -It's prepped scoops of mayo-based salads on the side. -Or it's a quick fry drop away from a basket of crispy fries. -It's prepped salad ingredients. -It's prepped soups. -And it's breakfast items, which require a minimum of time on the grill: no elaborate egg strata or baked french toast here.   I'm going to commit a cardinal Yelp sin here by saying the following, but I've worked at delis before. It's slop and drop. Something might require a bit of time on the grill, but for the most part, assemble and go. If you've been to Waffle House you've seen the breakfast version. If you've been to Miracle Mile, you've seen it deli-style. It's practically cafeteria line-order fare.   For the prices of the offerings and the extraordinarily poor service, I just don't get why anyone comes here for lunch. (And it's only open for breakfast and lunch.)  Get yourself some veteran hosts, servers and line cooks, Stan.  (They get an extra star because I ate breakfast there once-- like most of the reviews on here-- and it was pretty good.)

I have since been back twice, once for breakfast and another time for lunch. Stan, thank you for sacking whoever was dicking off the thing last time I came in to visit.  "That'll do, Pig. That'll do." Seal of Approval.

I love this place like crazy wild good times. It's not open on Mondays and that makes me sad. For some reason I always want to front-load my week with some Beaver Choice. But the fact that they have the only authentic Scandinavian food for miles (suck it, IKEA!) makes up for this common small biz quirk. Plus it's owned by some of the hardest working, nicest folks in the business. Real Swedes making real Swedish food that will bend over backwards to make sure you're satisfied with your experience.  Get the gravlax. The lady in charge buys only the best and cures it by hand, and for the price there's no better lox in town. Get the schnitzel. Get the lunch wraps for super cheap. Just get your ass there. It's freakin' fantastic and you will not regret the decision.   Be forewarned that this place is a walk-up, order-at-the-counter type joint. It's not full service so you won't be bothered every two seconds to see if "everything's okay" when you have a mouthful of Swedish meat-a-balls. You might have to get up and, like, walk back to the counter if you want a refill of something. Oh the horror.  In parting, do it. Do it fast. Do it furious. And do it with great frequency.  Beaver Choice!!

I really want to give this place four stars. Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger, fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes.   Granted the burger is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.  I do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger, for the wimps like me out there. Regardless, I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place, because they're seriously too good to get away.   The french fries are also in the style that I like, freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.  I also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there, but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly, that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it.   Alright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star. Damn your scrumptious fare, Five Guys. Your hypnotic grease has me entranced.

Thai iced tea with condensed milk and boba. Perfection. I love the flaky soft texture of the snoh ice. I want to make sticky snow angels in a vat of it. Be bold. Get red bean or taro. Avoid the boring strawberry.

Rad food. Only gripe is that the spice level is Midwestern mild. Aside from the tiny bottle of chile pequin hot sauce, there was hardly any spice to anything. That was great for the toddler in tow, because she could eat it all, and even slurped full spoonfuls of their salsa (which was odd).   Norteno de res torta is my favorite packed with steak and avocado. Chorizo is really well flavored too (and not at all spicy). But the quesadilla maiz en estilo del rey is the way to go! Gigantic homemade corn tortilla folded over melty cheese and your choice of filling, topped with cotija and crema and cilantro. So tasty.   I've tried their namesake torta del rey before, and only recommend it if you are getting the sandwich to go because that monster is unwieldy (unless you can unhinge your jaw like a snake) and will fall apart despite your best intentions. But then it turns into a sampler platter of every meat they offer? Anyway, at least at home your glutton ways are masked from sight, and you can get as bad as you wanna be on that behemoth torta.   Aguas are good too. Watermelon for life.

Barro's is what Digiorno wishes it could be with that rising crust crap. I swear, if I could eat Barro's every day without my arteries protesting, I would. (And could, because it's cheaper compared to other pricier options like Venezia's and Spinato's.)  The cheese is high quality, salty, melty, and they don't skimp. The crust is chewy and thick and awesome with some of those rad mega crust bubbles near the edge. The toppings are always high quality and generous. The wings are thick and juicy, deep fried to a crisp and then smothered in the perfect amount of sauce. And they deliver to me three miles away, which makes me super happy.

Real deal BBQ with no equal in the Valley. By now I have tried every meat and side combination possible. If you have to prioritize a two meat platter, here's what you get:   1. Fatty brisket. Embrace the flavor. Embrace the fat. Ask for a sample while waiting in line and let it melt in your mouth. 2. Pulled pork. While the fatty brisket is best without sauce, the smoky pork is the perfect conduit for their spicy BBQ on the table. Plus it's perfect for making little sammiches with the complimentary white bread, onions, and pickles. Get it on the rib if you prefer to gnaw on the bone.  3. Jalapeno cheddar grits. How grits should be done! Creamy with the perfect texture and just enough heat and cheese to keep it interesting.  4. Those beans. Swimming in sauce flavored with the cast offs from the brisket scrap basket. Peppery perfection.   Wild cards: Pecan pie, pastrami (Thursday, runs out quick), and big ole beef ribs (Friday and Saturday, not available on two meat platter).  Been, done that, no reason to stand in line for 30 mins to get it again: Smoked turkey (boring), lean brisket (no comparison to fatty brisket), homemade sausage (good, not great), potato salad (nothing special), cole slaw (totally forgettable).  GET IT.

Seriously misled by the yelp reviews and rating. Did everyone eat the same pizza I had? Because it was awful. I would rather eat Little Caesar's terrible pizza puck for a quarter of the price with double the flavor, and a bagged salad from Safeway.   Ordered the Bronx Bomber with a bunch of meats, all really low quality. Giant rectangles of squeaky ham squares marbled with big visible veins of fat should have been a cut to a quarter of that size (and wouldn't hurt to order up from your meat dealer, because when you buy low the taste reflects that). Meatballs tasted old with an odd mealy texture and metallic tang that dominated the flavors and left a terrible lingering aftertaste. Sausage rounds were forgettable. Pepperoni was okay but flabby and not crispy, like everything on the pizza. And it's not because the toppings were packed to tight, that's for sure. Weird crust too, bland and floury with zero flavor and no rise. Despite the flabby toppings and cheap cheese, the crust was somehow burned too? All for the low, low price of $17!  Got an antipasto salad too with the house dressing, couple handfuls of romaine lettuce for $6 with salami, more awful ham I discarded, pepperoni, provolone, and onions. Again everything was chopped way too big. Don't get the house dressing either. All oil and dried spices.   I was super excited to have a new pizza joint five minutes from my house, but that excitement was misplaced. Tossed the leftovers.
