This place is awesome. I've been going to sports clips for as long as I can remember and the last time, they messed my hair up so bad I had to seek other options. V's is right around the corner and I can't believe I waited so long to come here. My haircut was on point and it was the same price as sports clips!

Came here for a teeth cleaning and paid my bill completely upfront. Next thing I know I'm getting a letter from a creditor claiming I didn't pay my bill...
