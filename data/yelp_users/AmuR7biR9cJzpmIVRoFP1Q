Bad service. They were slow to give my order even though they were only a few customers that time. Also I spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting. Not only that, the place isn't all that neat. Find a spots of dirt on the floor. If it weren't a request of my niece then I wouldn't have gone here.

*Thumbs up* This place is has some really good sandwiches, more specifically the Duckling. Ofcourse you will taste the roasted duck in it, but what I'm pointing out here is that the flavor and goodness of this sandwich is truly amazing. It really hits the spot! Oh yeah, the coffee here is great too. Service was okay so it was all fine.

This place is listed as  Good For Working. I say "nah", cant barely read the book that I had and you suggest that this place is good for working? Nah. Latte is the greatest thing that they had, all other things on the menu beside this is not good. If I would rate Starbucks from 0-10, I would go for 4 or 5.  Cakes were also overpriced. I don't know what it taste like but hell I would sped that kind of money over that cake.

Definitely 100% delicious. Even my family that I had a great of place when we were going home and talking about how great the service and the wings here at Long Wong's Hot Wings. Absolutely the right place when you want to have a dinner with your family. A must try.

I didn't expect this place to be that good in terms of the products they offer.  I got here early in the morning the check out if they sell headphones, I wanna bought one because the one I got at home was very old. So I need a replacement because its really that old.   They had a lot of selections of nice looking headphones here. The good thing about this place was, their staff. You can easily get assistance on the person in their store. That's a good thing if you don't know where's those places that you need to go.  I bought a fine looking headset and it has very good sound when we tested it. It's inside the budget I've been having, so that was really sweet so I bought it.  I'm a very satisfied customer of Fry's Electronics. Would really love to come back again.

This restaurant definitely has a nice selection of food to choose. The food taste good and really delicious. Really worth every penny for the quality of the food you get here. This place has a nice ambience which really makes it good for fine dining. The service was okay, no problems whatsoever. Although it might need a little improvement in that area. Still a worthy place to go to. I recommend this restaurant.

Its just makes me wonder how these guys make their burgers. I had this one time copying their delicious burger and failed to do so, dunno what did went wrong all I did was buy a burger and imitate the burger. Wiw, seems like these guys has a secret ingrediet for their burgers.  They also have nice fries, good for pairing with the burger.  Yum, In-N-Out burger is the best.

It's my first visit here at America's Tacos Shop. I had these three top notch dishes of Carne Asado Tacos which probably the best thing here. Next time, I wanted to try their outdoor sit for new level of experience.

When I first came to this place I was kinda surprised seeing those antelope heads on the wall. Although it kinda freaked me out a little in the beginning, it wasn't all that bad. Pretty nice actually. Place is neat and atmosphere is good too. Had a latte and breakfast burrito and it was really good. Their tea is also something. I really like this place alot.

I've actually visited Rocket Burger for several times already. One word that I can describe their service is it is CONSISTENTLY GOOD. I've tried other burger joints but they simply don't get it that when I say "well done", I mean "well done".   Anyway, my fave is their Bacon Cheeseburger and their Philly Burger (hey, I'm a burger guy!). Meat is fresh and is cooked very well. The cheese properly melted making every bite a sumptuous rush. Will be back for more my friends!

I've tried their Brulee Burger before and it wasn't that good. But, now it's different, every bite is enchanting. The entire dishes had been upgraded into ultimate level of deliciousness. I never expected these big changes from this establishment.

The lobster mac&cheese is definitely my best bet here. The taste really gets stuck in your mouth. Just looking at it already makes my mouth drool. The flavor from this food is by far the best I have tasted so far. Another choice I would recommend is the dirty chips. Really good stuff.

This place is really brilliant especially for those BBQ lovers. I had been waiting for a long line and sit outside but the most important thing was the service so kind and quick. The brisket sandwich was totally astonishing. Make sure to go earlier for quality experience.

It's my first time to try their dishes. I tried their chicken fat biscuit and enjoyed everything, especially the tender belly. Settle yourself to grab few glasses of beer to complement with your food. It's a unique food experience, best for hang out spot.

This is my initial opinion about this company since the things we have packed and loaded to their truck are yet to arrive to its destination, but this company has given us a great deal of service during the first half of the move.    They gave us an honest quote. No hidden fees for us. On the moving day, 5 guys (including the driver) came and did a pretty good job. They were professional, hard-working and cleaned up the house before leaving.   Everything was in great shape when loaded into the truck. I just hope, the same thing can be said on the other end of the move. But for now, I give them 5 stars.
