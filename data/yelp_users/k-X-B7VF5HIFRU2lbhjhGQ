This place NEVER lets me down! Hands down the best brewery I've gone too! Doesn't matter if it's Tempe or the Scottsdale location the food is amazing as well as the service.  My boyfriend and I went in the other night at 11:30pm and were greeted right away.  He tried the wood chuck blueberry cider which he let me try, it was crisp and refreshing! So good!   We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which was delicious and I love the variety of chips and pita bread. The dip to chip/pita ratio was perfect! I always hate when I get more chips than dip! It dip was creamy and the pita bread was soft and warm.   We also got the modern pizza, it had arugula and prosciutto on it. I enjoyed it! It's a tad salty but it wasn't heavy eating it and it feeds two perfectly!   I always enjoy coming here, the quality is incomparable and I've been to more than my fair share of breweries!

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was amazing!!   When we first walked in it was a little bit awkward. They don't start serving until 4 PM, which is usually their happy hour time. I wasn't aware of that's when we walked up to the hostess she said to wait for the cow bell to ring and from there it was open seating throughout the restaurant for happy hour. We had gotten there a couple minutes before four, so we were waiting along with a bunch of other people in the lobby awkwardly.  However when the cow bell rang, we made our way all the way to the back towards the patio. Being it Arizona and that it's really hot outside, this place has such an amazing cool temperature patio. Not once did I feel hot or sticky. The fans were blowing, they have misters going, and they had plenty of shade.    We basically had the whole patio to ourselves till about an hour into our meal, which was awesome! Their happy hour is quite spectacular, I can now see why there is a line out the door waiting to get in. All their drinks and all their appetizers are at reasonable prices.   Besides the price being great, the service and the food was spot on! You are paying for quality and excellent service. Tonya was our server and she was amazing, she was very kind and patient and gave us recommendations on what to order. For starters we had the pork wings and nachos, we also had two mojitos.  These were off the happy hour menu, and they did not cheap out on portion sizes, and you can really taste the alcohol in your drinks which was nice. For our meal my boyfriend had the duck and I had the  fillet mignon steak. We ordered two sides one was their green chili mac & cheese and sautéed spinach with onions. Everything was cooked to perfection! Both dishes had their meats nice and tender, not dry at all. The steak had a nice char on it and it was a very well seasoned. The green chili mac & cheese is on early out of this world! I would seriously just go back for this dish by itself! The spinach and onions were very good also, the spinach wasn't too soggy and was perfectly wilted. We we both ordered margaritas, I got the prickly pear and my boyfriend got the original margarita. I love how the margaritas don't paste super sweet and you can taste the alcohol that you are paying for this drink!!! They're very generous with their portions!   Tonya our server, was so great! She was so attentive to our table even when she started getting busy and had more than six tables to serve. I mentioned to her that it was my boyfriend's birthday and she came out with a complimentary dessert for us to split!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone! I have been to Mastro steakhouse, that's right by them, and they just cannot compete with the Roaring Fork. Their food, their service, and their ambience trumps that place any day! So if you're looking for amazing cuisine that's not too expensive this is your place!

I was very excited to check this place out with my boyfriend because people have said great things about Papago Brewers beers. I was greatly disappointed. When we first walked in there was a big giant bear that said "Please seat yourself" so we sat down at a high top table. The place honestly wasn't that busy, there was five servers and about 8 tables. I worked at a restaurant for 5 years so i understand when a server is busy and can not get to a table right away.   We waited patiently, the server finally came and got our drinks right away.  The Rose cider was really good. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, which honestly was not worth the 8$. They served a small cup of the dip and a lot of chips. Which was irritating because I am paying for the dip not the chips that are like 2$ at a grocery store.   After we got our appetizer and drinks, our server abandoned us. He never came back to check in on us. We were ready to order entrees and more drinks however after waiting for 15 mins we decided not to order anything else and opted for the check. I had to flag down another server to bring us our check.  I watched all the servers hang out by the bar, chit chatting away, sometimes the servers just walked around the place but weren't checking in on tables or anything. They were just pretending to be busy doing something.   I was very disappointed with the service, not everyone has the luxury to spend money on dining out so when people do, it should be WORTH their money.   Papago's beers were good, can't say much for the food cause I wasn't able to get service to try anything else but I might give it one more shot to update the review.

My friend and I were reluctant to go at first but the friendly hostess at the front convinced us to try it. Needless to say I am so happy I listened!   We got an incredible view right by the window and got to watch the Bellagio fountain dance three times!! The menu was a little pricey but the quality of the food is amazing. When you're walking to the restaurant you have to walk through the kitchen, you got to see the chefs at work and it smelled amazing in there.   My friend and I both got the French onion soup which isn't like the  typical kind you get at other places, it was very creamy and flavorful. They also give you an amuse bouche and delicious house bread with butter. By the time my entree came, I was already full. We also both got the classic eiffle tower burger and pretty sure that was the best burger I have had in a long time. The beef patty was pretty big and very well seasoned. Every bite I took melted in my mouth. The most moist burger I have ever had!!  I also mentioned to the hostess it was my friends birthday and they surprised her with a cute dessert!!  I highly recommend coming here for either a nice romantic dinner or just a fun brunch!

If I could give zero stars I would. I went last night with a group of people for karaoke night. We found a place to sit up on the higher level area.   Let me begin with service, our server was pompous and rude. I was the DD so I just got water but He was scolding my friends about their Arizona driver licenses and how they have to switch it to the new one. I told him that was not true, it only applies if you have a vertical driver license, they both have horizontal. He continued to argue and say that's not correct and he would "let it slide this once." I looked it up and I'm correct. It applies to vertical license and old AZ driver licenses are okay until October 1, 2020 for travel at airports. He should get his facts straight.   He also made a rude comment to us, he asked us if we were still "sitting pretty" and my friend answered "yes."  He then said, "Just like a quadriplegic beauty queen." I didn't think that was funny at all and it was offensive.  He also took about 20 mins to pick up our check from our table and we were dying to leave at this point.   We were excited for Karaoke and my friend put our names in, she asked them where to put our paper and they said on the lap top. She said it wasn't a large pile and I'm sure we would be singing in like 15-20 mins. WRONG. We waited an hour and a half.. We never got up there. What pisses me off the most was the girl server that works there sang TWICE and our personal server got to sing too. Yet we still had not been called up there? You should let your patrons have an opportunity to sing first before you staff. Even the couple in front of us seemed upset too because they were waiting to sing too. I think their should be an actual sign up sheet. Not scraps of paper so whoever is working the karaoke machine can't pick and choose who is next.   I don't think I'll be back here, the service and the lack of organization of karaoke killed it for me.

I was in need of a new eye doctor because the last one I went to was awful. It would take me two hours from my appointment time to get seen.   At 20/20 Image Eye Center, I was so impressed. The paper work was easy and fast to fill out and a minute later I was being walked back to an exam room! Linda was super friendly and helpful and made the diagnostic testing super easy, efficient and comfortable.   Dr. Shifrin is wonderful! I explained to her how my previous eye doctor visits from my old eye doctor did not clear up the itchiness of my eyes and how I couldn't wear contacts anymore. She set up a plan right away giving me eye drop prescriptions to clear it up as well as getting me fitted back into contacts. She was very patient and answered all of my questions! I even got a trial box of contacts! I'll be doing a follow up with her in two weeks. My eyes are already starting to feel less itchy! Great patient care! I wasn't rushed out at all, she took her time with me and I appreciated that tremendously!

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. We stood at the front for a good couple mins without being greeted. There was only the bartender that was up there and he was busy taking a takeout order. It wasn't busy either, there was only one other table when we walked in. However when the bar tender was finished he greeted us kindly and told us to sit wherever we liked.   We sat near the back, there was only one server around. She took a little bit of time to actually come and greet us. However, she was very friendly and got us menus and drinks right away.  After we got our drinks, another server actually came  to get our food order. She was very friendly as well and our food came out real quick! It was so delicious and it tasted fresh! I love how they serve healthy tasty food!   Overall the food was great and the service was good! I would definitely come back again!

The atmosphere here is so laid back and relaxing! I really enjoyed that. I went with my boyfriend for the first time. We walked in right around 4pm and it wasn't too busy but there was a decent amount of people at the bar top and patio. Their patio is really nice and has many tables! We decided to sit inside at one of their high top tables.   Our server came over in a few mins with waters and gave us a min to decide on drinks. It was also happy hour so a pitcher of beer was 6$ and so was any cocktail/ wine. I asked her what she recommended and she said the summertime cocktail was her favorite. I got that and it was amazing! It tasted sweet and refreshing! My boyfriend got a pitcher  of Hoppy IPA beer, he said he really liked it.   For an appetizer we had the Thai Hummus. The hummus was very good, however the pita bread that they served with it was very stiff and hard. Kinda disappointing.   For entrees I had the "Burger and cheese" burger, it had Gouda cheese, smoked bacon, lettuce and tomato with their special sauce. The server asked me if I wanted my burger pink or not pink. I have never heard of this at any other place, I'm always used to saying medium well or well done. I guess they only serve it two ways?! Anyways the burger was good but nothing special. It was a little dry and bland. I didn't really taste the sauce in it. Again not amazing but good. My boyfriend got the "grilled salmon BLT burger", his was a little dry for him as well. The heroes in our entrees were the French fries, I got regular, he got sweet potato. They were the best fries I have ever had! Each one was crisp to perfection!!   Overall the service  was really good and the atmosphere is great! It's a perfect place to come to and wind down for the day. I would totally go back for the drinks and the service alone! The food was nothing to brag about, but still good.

Just experienced the WORST service ever from this place. I am so disappointed because I come here all the time for brunch and always had great service. Tonight my boyfriend and I came in at around 9:00pm. It didn't seem super busy for a Friday Night and we got seated immediately in the first booth around corner.   We waited a good 10 minutes before I decided to go up to the hostess who was texting on her cell phone. I told her it had been a while and no one had come to greet us, she said she would go find our server. Of course when I came back to my table our server appeared.   She barley Introduced herself and asked if we wanted anything besides water. We quickly ordered our drinks and appetizer with her. She even commented "you guys are ready for me!"     15-20 minutes later still NO water, drinks or appetizer. We kept looking around for her thinking she was busy, but we noticed she just kept talking to what seemed to be her friends sitting at the end of the bar.   And what I don't understand is, if she rang up our drinks which I'm pretty sure she DIDN'T, how the 3 bartenders there couldn't run the drinks to the table?   We finally GAVE UP waiting and just walked out. As we were leaving the hostess at the front said "Have a great night!" If she wasn't so busy on her damn phone maybe she would realize that we were a table she just sat 30 mins ago and maybe she needed to ask why we were leaving?  So disappointed in this place, we were ready to spend money there and get a few drinks apps and dinner but it seems to me that they don't need our business.   Now off to four peaks where I always get great service no matter what time of day it is!

I am updating my review. After a terrible experience, the owner was very kind and reached out to me, so I was glad to come back and give the Vig another shot!   I arrived with my party around 5pm in front of the host stand, the host was on the phone so we were not greeted right away, a second hostess came up  and greeted us and took us to a table.   The service was wonderful! Our server Garrett was super nice and gave us some drink recommendations. My friend and I got the stolee blueberry Moscow mule and it was delicious! Her husband and my boyfriend got some beers. Drinks came out right away and our waters were constantly refilled which was great! I always have a water test at places to see how good service is. They were spot on last night. The only thing I would say is, sometimes we would get a lime in our mules and the other times we didn't get one. We each ordered 4 of those drinks, maybe the bartender was just busy and forgot the garnish?  I ordered the double down hummus dip and the boys got the wings. My friend ordered wrong and got The Trifecta which are sliders but she's a vegetarian and can't eat that. I told her I would switch dishes with her. When the food came out Garrett remembered what I ordered and asked if everything was alright, we explained to him about the mishap. He was so nice and without hesitation offered to take it back and to get the dish my friend wanted. I told him it was alright and man those sliders were great! The pretzel bun and the sauce were so delicious on the beef patty.   When the check came we were all set and the manager took initiative to come and grab it for Garrett so we didn't have to wait, which we appreciated because after 4 mules I was ready to go home for a nap!  I am happy I came back for another chance at the Vig because the food, service, and ambience is great and I hope it stays this way! Definitely would recommend this place to friends family.

First time here, my best friend and I were looking for a good happy hour spot and I came across this place on Yelp.  Taylor, our server was excellent and the food was fantastic! We got there at 4pm and there was hardly anyone there, then a few drinks and appetizers later this place was a packed house!   I'm all about quality service when I go out to eat and Taylor, as well as the other staff members were wonderful! Taylor made sure my water was filled every time! She kept bringing us fresh plates for every new dish we shared. Super attentive which I appreciate! The staff helped bring our drinks  and food over when they were ready from the bar/kitchen. You can tell it's great team work in there and the service quality shows it!   For drinks we each did one white and one red wine. Another server who had brought over our water helped make some wine recommendations to us.    For food we got the bruschetta which you can choose up to 3 different ones for $12. The bread was fresh and easy to bite into and the avocado, pickled onion, cilantro and jalapeño one was our favorite! We also got shucked oysters with their angry sauce which was delicious, and Taylor recommend their steamed mussels with garlic sauce and bread for dipping. Usually I don't like seafood at restaurants not near the water but man they were excellent. I would also recommend their grilled cheese with this life changing jam that they serve it with. As if we didn't eat enough Taylor asked us if we wanted dessert which we happily accepted! The tres leches cake was superb! There wasn't anything I didn't like about any of the food items we received!    Overall I'm coming here again and I think I wanna do my birthday dinner here!

It was our first time here and the night manager Christina was SUPER NICE and really sweet! She offered us a rewards card that she activated for us and when we told her it was our first time she gave us a free loaf of their house bread! Paradise bakery has nothing on this place! I don't think I'll be going back to Paradise Bakery after this...Such great customer service, I haven't had that in such a long time. We will DEFINITELY be back! :)
