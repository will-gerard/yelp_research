Had this place for the first time last night with my husband! OMG! It blew my mind how delish their food was! I got "The Special" which was a meaty and delicious burger with a fried egg on it, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions! But I added sliced Avocado! It was literally the best burger I've had in a long time.. I'd go as far as to say, best burger I've had in the last year! SO so good!

Just to start the food was decent. Can't complain too much. Now that that's outta the way here comes all the bad. This location is ridiculous! The staff is very inattentive because you'll order I've tea but they won't bring you any sugar and when you finally catch them and ask for sugar they bring you a small tray full of sweet and low only. Not sugar. Next, the music. We're talking full on norte√±as and duranguense music. To clarify, I am of Latin origin, my family is from Mexico more specifically so I would know what that type of music is or even what is sounds like. And I was born here In Phoenix mind you. HOWEVER.. The other 50 people in the building probably don't share my same ethnic background much less know what is being said in these songs that are blasting and blaring! I would expect this from macayos but not Applebee's. Overall very unimpressed or even comfortable with the atmosphere. So the only thing that was ok was the food. Just ok though. Anyway if your like me and want a good experience from a family restaurant I'd rethink this place. Just saying.

So I just had an amazing experience here. When I was ordering the girl at the register (must've been new) overcharged me for the add-ons. Well not a minute later the manager caught the overcharge and came over to my table and gave me back the overage. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before and that in itself will bring me back here. The subs were amazing but the service, the service will bring me and my family back!! #veryhappycustomer
