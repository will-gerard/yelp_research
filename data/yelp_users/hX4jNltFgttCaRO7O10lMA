I have been coming here for years and I keep coming back. Yes, it's an older building but it feels authentic. Hot sauce is one of the best in town. Order the cheese crisp, extra cheese and extra crispy. Yum!

If you go Veggie, pick a dish where the Tofu is fried in the wok, not steamed. So much better.

Tried this cleaner because of previous reviews and I am in total agreement with them. Great customer service, all my items came out great. Price was very reasonable as well.  I will be returning with more items in the future.

Wow! I was just here a few months ago. How fast can a burger place go down hill? I wish I would have read the recent reviews before eating here. I would have gone to In-n-Out in a heart beat.  Just like previous patrons have stated, the burger tastes like it is freezer burned, the 'Endless' fries are not very good, the service is lacking, the bartender assumed I wanted Med. their version is very pink and greasy as well.  Only positive is the beer.  Next time I'll drive out of my way to a close Red Robin. Everything is much better there.

An OUTRAGEous Experience!  I am flabbergasted by today's visit. After making the always difficult decision of what to eat for lunch, I couldn't get the thought of a juicy, flavorful burger out of my mind. So after ordering my typical Teriyaki Burger, med-rare, sans onions and waiting the ever long wait time of five-ish minutes. I was shocked to see a sandwich that looked nothing like the burger I had envisioned just minutes earlier.   The look on my face, dumbfounded and deflated, must have been the clue to the lady presenting me with this meal that something was not right. After explaining to her that I thought I had ordered the Teriyaki Burger, she apologetically took the sandwich back. After reordering my burger, said I could take the Tri-tips sandwich home and try it. On top of that, since it cost more than the burger, she tried to force a free sandwich coupon my way. Who does she think I am? I refused of course! You can't buy my integrity with free food! No way!    Of course I'll be back and continue to eat their delicious burgers. Maybe even the occasional Tri-tips sandwich depending on how good this one tastes for dinner.   Thank you management and staff for a great meal and service at a great price!
