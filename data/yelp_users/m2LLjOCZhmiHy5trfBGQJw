Food is always great.   Never disappointed      The Louisiana pasta with the Parmesan chicken is my favorite but with the penne instead of the bow tie.   They never complain or upcharge.      A couple of times I wanted it but could get there so I used door dash to deliver.  Great partnership.  Love it.   Always coming back to that fantastic place.

As always we had a fantastic experience here.  This time was actually exceptional. We brought our son with us and Sophia (our server) was awesome.  Sometimes when people bring kids to a restaurant the staff is put off but this place was just awesome.    Everyone stop by to say hi to him and the manager even brought him cut mango to try.   He loved the attention and we loved the experience.  Thank you Sophia for a perfect experience.

Back in 2009 I bought tires from here after my brothers friend recommendation.     The tires were reasonably priced but short lived.  The warranty is only 30days and unfortunately the tires didn't last 30 days.   The front passenger tire developed a "bump" within 2 weeks which luckily I was able to get off the freeway before it tore apart.      I went to the shop and since I had the receipt, they replaced it.   Being that the other tires on the truck, I had concerns about the others.   They told me that they would not do anything about the others unless they had similar issues.      Two days later on the way to a job in Verado, on I-10 my co-worker and I head a constant loud sound.  The scary thing is I was traveling about 70mph with semi trucks all around.      In the matter of 3 seconds noise went to an explosion sound and at that moment I passed the bridge over cottonwood lane.   Once the vehicle stopped, I was able to check the vehicle and see that my bed side panel is gone and the only parts that remained of the tire were the rings on the wheel hub.     I contacted Tire Dawgs and the only thing they told me was that if I brought them the tire, and the receipt that they would replace it, just that tire.   As for the other vehicle damage, I was told I am on my own.     I went to a different tire place at baseline and 7th st and had all the tires replaced with something with a real warranty, by a reputable company that backs up what they sell and doesn't have just a 30 day warranty.   The only reason that this review isn't a 1 star is that it was a while ago and since they moved and are still around I'm hoping that they are better than they use to be..  Be careful when you get something here.   Make sure you don't need it for the long term.

While I normally do recommend them for somethings I can tell you is that they don't pull an order until you Arrive.    It is better that you just get the materials yourself.   Unfortunately they lack what Home Depot does in spades.

We had a great experience with quality systems. I had asked them before they came out to go ahead and give the system complete check and make sure that everything is working fine  The only thing they were able to find that was wrong was the Freon was low. They replenished it and said everything else is working perfectly. My house is cool and I am very happy.  Thank you Larry and Jose!

Matt and his team have done exceptional with each customer they have.  They treat each client as family and make sure that it is the smoothest process for buying or selling a home.    Their team handles all aspects of the process and keeps you informed through out.     When it comes to residential real estate transactions, they are top notch.
