One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast, and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu. I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch.

The short: It's all solidly good--the not-too-pricey coffee, the simple pastries, the breakfast sandwiches and knishes, the baristas, and the comfortable and mellow atmosphere when going solo or meeting a few friends.   The long: Located on the southeast corner of Indian School and 36th St., in the strip mall between Tuesday Morning and Darwin's, MJ's is accessible and fairly easy to sign. The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar.   Speaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today's college-aged generation, some with interesting piercings and tattoos, fashionable and stylish by not trendy clothes--seems like there's an appreciation for staff who are unique, interesting, and good workers. It's never uncomfortable, though--meaning, I never feel too old or unhip or out of place there. Customers truly run the gamut, from quiet middle-aged women catching up with each other, moms and/or dads with kids, suit-and-tie professionals stopping in for a cuppa, people hitting the wi-fi, and angsty artsy types having heated but civil political debates.   I usually have the chai tea latte, but their coffee is always solid (I can attest to a decent café mocha), and I hear a lot of praise about their daily specials--every day, a different bean, special coffee, and iced tea. Prices are a little cheaper than Starbucks (I think it was $2.50 for the tasty mango lemon iced tea, and the larger specialty coffees can go up to $4.50), but the drinks are better. Pastries are always tasty and include a small selection of rugalah (buttery, flaky, chocolatey goodness--also available with raspberry or apple), a bigger selection of muffins, big and puffy croissants, bagels, cookies, brownies, rice krispie treats--certainly not a fully stocked French patisserie, but what they have is usually really good quality. They also serve one or two different quiches every day, potato knishes, breakfast sandwiches, and omelets.

The place is beautifully sunlit and airy, filled with fine modern clean lines and just enough easy color and art to add visual interest, not too crowded, and not uncomfortably trendy. They were well suited for my large group of friends and I, so we were excited when we decided to have dinner there.   The menu selection was decent--standard cafe fair, with sandwiches, wraps, and salads. They had a nice wine selection, although I thought their per-glass charge seemed a little pricey. Service was fine and quick enough, so I have nothing bad to say there. The highlight: The Tuna Almondine I ordered was delicious! It was not overdressed or strangely sweet like a lot of tuna fish sandwiches out there, and the almonds added a nice toasted nutty flavor without it or their hard, slightly crunchy texture getting in the tuna's way. But it's hard to mess up tuna, and I was easily able to recreate the dish at home for a lot less than 11 bucks. Okay, I can understand--it's café food. There's ambiance to pay for, and it is nice there. And someone back in the kitchen works hard to make that sandwich. Fine. But the deal breaker was the leaf salad that came with my sandwich.   Just about all of us had the same salad with our wraps and sandwiches. My salad was limp, fainted dead away. And it smelled like freshly mown grass, which is totally fine if we're discussing freshly mown grass, and not something I'm expected to shove into my maw. To be fair, my dining companions could only kind of smell what I could in their own salads, so it wasn't as big as an affront to them. Maybe I just got the bottom of the bag, since it did seem to just be a bagged mix. Plus, my taste buds and especially my sense of smell are sensitive--not saying they're great or even good, but they seem pick things up that a lot of folks don't. Everyone thought their food ranged from "good" to "pretty good." Overall, it's a decent option if you're in the area and want a nice café experience. (Read: Don't want to hit the nearest sandwich shack or deli, like my preference, Miracle Mile Deli up on Central and Thomas, or want a sit-down as opposed to a grab-and-go, like Willo Baking Co. right next door--holy yum, with beautiful desserts, and last I checked, they supplied My Florist's bread, anyway). So try My Florist for yourself, but for the price, do not hesitate to bring a discerning palate or be embarrassed to send a dish back if it's not up to par.

Rosie McCaffrey's  The short: The best no-frills bar food I've had in a long time in a dim, but clean and cheery pub environment with decent service--a good addition to a list of dependable, casual standbys.   The long:  Rosie's located on the north side of Camelback and it really sticks out because it looks like a cute, two-story Irish pub dropped down between a couple of car dealerships. Every time we drive by on a weekend night, the place is lit up and packed to the gills with a line of cars waiting to get in to park, so I can attest from that that parking is a stinker during prime pub hours. We went on a Saturday afternoon, though, for lunch, and parking in their lot on the west side of the building was a breeze. The pub theme carried through inside, even more so, with dark-stained wood booths and trim everywhere. There were a couple of handfuls of patrons starting their bar tabs early, and as we progressed through our meal, more people came in to eat and drink. It was nice how all the wood sucked up the sound, so while the place filled up slowly but steadily, it never got very noise. The walls are covered with really cool art, including giant portraits depicting Irish heroes and influences like James Joyce.   We snuck in through the west entrance and were at first confused as to where and how to get a table, but after we flagged down some help, we were told to sit anywhere and were brought a couple of menus after a short wait. We gave a drink order, and it took another short wait before someone came to take our food order. After that, service rolled along pretty well--our glasses were kept full and empty dishes were quickly picked up and taken away.   We started with Rosie's chili con queso dip--queso with beef brisket, rotel tomatoes, chilies, and tortilla chip. The dip was brought in a little cauldron surrounded by tri-color chips. Some were stale, but most of them were fine. The dip started off a little runny and seemed to be all liquid cheese, but we could taste the yummy brisket, and after awhile, we found the few precious, tender meat chunks that were in there. All in all, it was pretty tasty, even if it wasn't uniform.   My boyfriend had Rosie's Reuben with fries. The Reuben came with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Thousand Island dressing. I was jealous when I tried it. I love a good Reuben, and Rosie's Reuben is solid--grilled-crisp bread, tender and succulent flavorful corned beef, not overdressed, gooey cheese that doesn't take over--so good. I had "Our Famous Best of Phoenix Harp Battered Fish-N-Chips," which came with coleslaw, sweet potato fries, and tartar sauce. I saw several awards Rosie's had won from rags like the New Times, so I figured I should go with those blaring recommendations. I'm happy I did! The fish was crunchy, but not overbattered and had a clean taste. Both the sweet potato fries and regular fries were great--they came crispy and stayed crispy through the whole meal.

The short: Mouthwatering Cuban-influenced cuisine, awesome service, cute and warmly decorated space with a cool mix of art all over the walls. This is a restaurant I'll be going back to.   The long:  Fuego Bistro is off the east side of 7th St., just south of Bethany Home. Keep an eye out for the sign that says Apollo and turn in just north of that building. Fuego Bistro is next door to Apollo, and the small main parking lot is on the east side of the restaurant, but there's parking, sometimes makeshift, up and down Palo Verde Dr. If you're brave, or dumb, you can try to use the spot with the power pole growing out of it.   I liked the look of the place--not too loud (visually or otherwise), and cozy without looking homely. I love the art there. The diners represented an even spread, which is always nice to see. The restaurant smelled like pork, but not in a scary way--it smelled like their famous pernil asado. The host was friendly, and the rest of the service staff was wonderful--fast, efficient, and totally unobtrusive, sliding silverware and refills in as needed before slipping quietly away, doing quality control checks after we'd taken a couple of bites of each course. That was especially impressive, considering out table was just big enough for the two of us.   We split the appetizers. First we had the green chile cheeseburger empanadas with Yucatan BBQ Sauce, and fresh pico de gallo. While a lot of food can get by solely on the merit of being fried as long as they're fried well, as these were, the filling and accompaniments were so yummy. All the flavors melded together beautifully, and the pico de gallo added the fresh zest and bright flavor I wanted to start off the meal. We also had the Ancho-dusted Pacific wild salmon croquette with fresh capers and lemon buerre blanc. This was also well done and tasty, though it took a backseat to the empanada for me.   My entree was the signature pernil asado, which the restaurant describes as "slow roasted succulent pork shoulder with a mango habanero mojo sauce." And it absolutely was as mouthwatering as its description implies. This was as good as any pernil asado I've ever had, and while I can't attest to Fuego Bistro's recipe, I can definitely say it tasted like a hunk of luscious meat that's been marinated overnight and roasted low and slow for 5 or 6 hours before landing on my plate. *sigh* It came with a continuous supply of little flour tortillas, tasty chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked and delicious sauteed organic green beans.   My boyfriend has the Fuego chile relleno, which was stuffed with "Natural Chicken, Black Bean, arroz, Oaxacan cheese, Penko Breaded in a Guajillo Chile Sauce." This dish was also really good and well cooked, but I was more impressed with his side dishes--a highly addictive green chili cornbread casserole and maple chiliglazed carrots, which were the best cooked carrots I've ever had. Between my green beans and his carrots, I was totally happy. If you make veggies as if they were a boring obligation or afterthought, you lose major points. I eat my veggies first before any other part of the entree, and if I don't want to go into my main dish feeling sad. Fuego Bistro does veggies right.   For dessert, we had the Ancho dusted chocolate torte and the horchata chocolate chip bread pudding. Dessert's often the highlight of a dinner out for me, and while both were good in this case with the chocolate torte being my choice, it doesn't bother me at all that the first and second courses were the stars of the meal. Bonus points for the bartender who was so willing and gracious as to translate their extensive mojito menu into virgin drinks for us, since we weren't drinking that night. We would not turn down another round of watermelon and mango mojitos, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu.

The short: Delicious, authentic food in generous portions; polite, quick, and attentive service; clean and well-lit generic ambience.   The long: We decided to go here because we'd heard the food was great, but after reading reviews about poor service during the drive up, I almost changed my mind. I'm so glad I didn't! While the service wasn't that overbearing "fake-friendly" you see at a lot of places, the three servers who worked our table were just fine.   Located in a plain, well-weathered shopping center on the northeast corner of Tatum and Thunderbird, the place really isn't much to look at. It's clean, and during our early dinner, light streamed in through the windows.   We ordered the Pu Pu Platter, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, Rock Cod Fish Fillet with Vegetable, and Honey Walnut Shrimp, and everything came out reasonably quickly, with plenty of time to enjoy our appetizer. While we enjoyed everything, the Pu Pu Platter was our least favorite. The Hibachi's flame was a little out of control, which was hilarious, but we set the skewers on fire when we tried to char our skewered beef. The fried shrimp, egg rolls, crab Rangoon, and BBQ pork were nothing special, but the paper wrapped chicken (wrapped in foil) was a nice change as well as the most authentic thing on the platter.  The flavorful eggplant melted in our mouths, just the way I love it, but it could've used a bigger knock of heat, so I'll have to make sure to request it next time. The generous serving of honey walnut shrimp was also delicious, with plump, crispy fried shrimp and fresh candied walnuts in a sauce that wasn't too sweet or greasy. The rock cod was our favorite, with a lot of tender, moist pieces of fish mixed in with the tender baby bok choy and fresh carrots. It tastes just like my boyfriend's mom's version. And of course, the rice was fresh, piping hot, and fluffy.   While there are dozens of Chinese places between our house and Nee House, I'd gladly make the drive up here again to try more dishes and order what have already become favorites.

The short: Pink Spot's ice cream has my favorite texture--dense, almost chewy, and smooth. The flavors are spot on. Parking can seem tricky, but there's more along the side and in back, and inside, there's ample seating but with a cozy feel. Service is good, and so are the cookies we've tried.   The long: Parking out front can be tricky, especially since all the spots slant southeast, but there's more parking around the side and behind the building. Then you might have to duck under or around some patio umbrellas to get to the front door. Once you're inside and home free, though, you have a clean, open interior with couches, tables, and chairs, bookshelves with games and books along the side, and the counter lining the back wall. There's a doorway into the pizza joint next door, too.   The counter help is friendly, quick, and efficient, and I'm glad they aren't stingy with the sample tastes because I always want to try everything I haven't already tried, and sometimes I just want a taste of something I already know I like. We liked the ice cream so much the first time, we went back twice in one week. We've tried Callebaut chocolate, mint chip, chocolate peanut butter, salted caramel, and pistachio, and they all have good, pure flavors. The texture is perfect--better than any other ice cream I've ever had. I don't know what little mom and pop creamery Pink Spot is coming from (last I read, it was Karen's Kreamery), but whoever they are, they're doing wonderful things.   The baked goods are made in-house, and they're also excellent. I can't get enough big, soft, chewy cookies, and this has been a dependable place to get them. I haven't tried anything off their savory or coffee menus, but I plan to next time I visit.

Caribbean Fusion offers unique menu including many dishes beyond jerk for those looking for something a little different, friendly and efficient service, prices fairly easy on the wallet, and wonderful food!  This was my first Caribbean restaurant experience, and it was a great one. Like many overlooked dining gems, it's tucked into a strip mall on the east side of Scottsdale Rd. along with a Sleep America, a mexican joint, and a bar, but it's worth seeking out. When we walked into the darkly decorated but well-window-lit restaurant, our hostess/server, Judith, greeted us with a huge smile and continued through the meal with helpful menu hints, intriguing food information, and top-notch service. The tables were cleanly dressed, but even though it was a "cloth napkin setting," we felt comfortable in our casual clothes.  My bf ordered the sweet, fresh Fruit Fusion smoothie--a wine glass  of mango, strawberry, and raspberry purees--and I ordered the tarter and refreshing Tropical Lemonade--lemonade with mango and strawberry and mango purees (each was $5). Wanting some new flavors, we started with the Ackee and Salt fish Strudel, described on the menu as "sauteed onion, peppers, dried codfish and julienne tomatoes with Jamaican ackee wrapped in flaky phyllo pastry, served with a spiced tomato sauce." For $4.50, we received two servings of the pastry, dressed in spicy red sauce. We could slightly smell the cod, but it wasn't overpowering, and the taste with the red sauce was awesome--buttery, savory, salty, with sparks of flavor from the cod and, I assume, the ackee throughout. It was just enough to whet our appetites.  My bf ordered the jerk pork ("leg of pork marinated in Jamaican herbs and spices, roasted over open spit and served with a jerked pork sauce"), roasted garlic & parmesan mashed potatoes, and fried plantains ($10.50). Every bite I tried was delicious, the components perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. For some reason, fried plantains have always seemed starchy or "green" tasting, but these were soft with a ripe, gentle banana flavor, without the sweetness of an actual banana. I ordered the braised ox tail (braised medallion cuts of ox tail with chunky vegetables, lima beans, and dumpling spinners), green beans with bacon bits, and french fries (I'd been hoping to try the fried bammy, but they were out)($12). The ox tail was perfectly cooked--melt-in-my-mouth soft and tender. I usually don't like thick-cut fries, but while these were wide, they were also skinny, so the crunch skin-to-soft hot mashy innards ration was perfect. Plus, they stayed crispy through the entire meal instead of going mushy within minutes. Our waitress brought two hot pepper sauces, which I enjoyed--one just a regular red pepper sauce, and the other a scotch bonnet sauce.   Dessert options included standard American offerings--carrot cake, strawberry cheesecake, hot fudge sundae--and we almost skipped until our waitress described the tuxedo cake: layers of cake, vanilla mousse, and chocolate mousse topped with whipped cream. A fabulous ending, even if it wasn't very Caribbean.  We plan to go back to try the Wednesday-night buffet. Judith gave us animated and excited descriptions of several of the dishes, and we're looking forward to returning.  Update: Went to the buffet with a few friends, and we enjoyed it--there were some nice, rich, savory flavors! It was gluttinous, getting to eat as much oxtail as I wanted. Janice was right--the curried goat does not taste gamy at all. The seafood ragout in white sauce was delicious, as was the escovitch fish (red snapper, according to the bartender, who was also bussing tables and visiting with tables). The jerk chicken was a little problematic--one friend's was overcooked, and mine seemed somehow grisly, which I've never encountered with chicken. Both of us left the chicken on the plate even though the flavor was fine. It was nice to see a chafing dish filled with their tasty mashed potatoes, as well as plenty of their tuxedo cake on the little dessert table, which also offered carrot cake and cheesecake. Other offerings included a small salad bar, chicken soup, rolls, steamed veggies, and seasoned rice and peas. My friend had a mojito but said it was too sweet; the bartender graciously remade it without a shrug--yet more kudos for attentive service. I do hope that they lighten their buffet selection as the weather warms, though!

The short: Tasty Thai, very friendly service, and a clean, well-lit, comfortable, and quiet strip mall space.  The long: La's Thai is just south of the gas station on the southeast corner of Hayden and McDowell, and there's plenty of parking in front and behind the complex, with a handy backdoor if you're in the back. We were greeted by some very friendly young women and told to pick a table--plenty to choose from at 7 pm on a Saturday as there were just a couple of tables taken and a couple of people ordering takeout (more came in as the night went on). Decor is a little generic, but comfortable and interesting, with a few of the tables sporting some pretty woven cloths and some carved wood art on the walls.   We had the fresh rolls, satay, stuffed chicken wings, Pad Thai at medium heat, Panang curry at medium heat, and white sticky rice with mango (purple rice was an option, but our server said she favored white, so we went with that). The fresh rolls were going to be my step-daughter's entree, but she's allergic to cucumbers, and I was a bonehead and forgot to ask if the rolls used them--of course they did, and our server offered to take them away and bring something else for her. We decided to just have her eat the satay as her entree while the rest of us used the fresh rolls as our app. We ordered a Thai tea, iced tea, and young coconut drink (it came in a tall can that served two) to drink. All the beverages were tasty.  All the apps came together, including the spring rolls kiddo had ordered as her entree, which was fine because we switched her meal around, anyway. Everything was very good, although I was a little baffled by the big scoops of either cabbage, lettuce, or both that accompanied every dish except for the stuffed wings and Panang curry. I initially wondered if the stuff was a garnish, but there was way too much of it. It was fine with the satay, and we ate bites of cabbage with the chicken and the delicious peanut sauce it came with, although that sauce strangely started to congeal a little bit as the meal went on. That didn't affect its flavor, though. The satay chicken was wonderful--tender and moist, slightly sweet and aromatic with spices. The lettuce scoop didn't make sense with the fresh rolls, which were already stuffed with greens. The peanut sauce that came with the spring rolls was even better than the satay's, and yay, it stayed completely liquid! Neither of the peanut sauces were sweet (I swear some places use Jif peanut butter), and they had that nice umami flavor with a slightly sour edge that I love in Thai peanut sauce. The fresh rolls were, indeed, fresh--lettuce, pops of flavorful herbs, glass noodles, crunchy chopped cucumber, and fresh, chewy wrappers. We were divided on the stuffed wings. An interesting idea--a dense pork filling in boned, fried, full-size wings (not drummettes!). It was well cooked and the chicken skin had a nice crisp to it, but the filling, and thus the whole dish, was just underwhelming.  I liked the Pad Thai, although it was lighter on veggies than I'm used to; but it's exactly as described in the menu: "Small rice noodles stir-fried with shrimp, chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts and peanuts." La's is a very noodle-centric dish, but the noodles were perfectly cooked--not gummy, clumpy, oily--a good chew without being undercooked, and loose so each noodle came up separately. The proteins were also perfectly cooked--not dry and over cooked like a lot of Pad Thais I've had. As for the heat--I couldn't find it, so it was more mild than medium. I think the Panang curry got all my chili.  The curry was thick, rich, and packed with peanut flavor, again without being too sweet, and overall tasty. The veggies were cooked well with just some crunch to them, and the chicken was again tender and moist. It came with a big side of rice--plenty to make at least two servings of food.   We all loved the sticky rice with mango. Such a beautifully simple dish--a generous serving of sweet rice coated with coconut cream and two big hunks of sweet, fresh yellow mango; this was one of the best versions we've had--every component just right.  Overall, while there are plenty of good Thai spots in the area, I wouldn't pass La's Thai if I were in the area.

The short: Recommended for the tried-and-true hot dog fan looking for new hot dog experiences--bacon-wrapped dogs cooked on a flat top, dressed with some peculiar condiments such as mayonnaise, beans, onions, and chopped tomatoes. This isn't for the weak of heart, but it is for the daring dog lovers who understand this dog's attempt at being the "perfect bite."   The long: I read a well-known blogazine's article about the country's best hot dogs, and Sonoran hot dogs had a solid standing on the list. They seem to be easy finds around Tucson, but not here in Phoenix. I've heard of a lot of talk about where to find these throughout the Valley--usually nomadic carts that rove around Indian School out west (in the avenues), but this truck has a "reserved spot" so to speak in the parking lot of Guitar and Keyboard City on the southwest corner of Indian School and 20th St. Stragenly, I've only ever seen it there after the sun goes down, and I've gotten dogs there as late as 11 p.m.  When you drive up, all you see are a white van, hood up so its battery can power the impromptu eatery--an electric lantern forming a tight space containing a flat top (griddle), a table holding various condiments on ice (cotija cheese, smooth guacamole), and some little to-go containers to fill and take away, a five little plastic folding tables and chairs so you can sit and eat, communal style, and a little TV for ambiance. A woman's cooking up the dogs and sliding them into their wonderfully soft, pillowy bolillo buns, and a man dresses them and wraps them up in foil for you. The man will greet you with a nod or hello, then ask you how many dogs you'd like. He'll whisper it to the woman grilling the dogs, and within moments, you're ready to go. The little tables are fine, especially with Phoenix's typical great night-time weather, but I prefer the dashboard picnic. Just be careful about keeping your toppings in your bun--nothing like a wayward bean bouncing off into the dark crevices of your car.)  If you stack on extra condiments, put the "lightweight" stuff down first, or you'll risk having it all tumble off with your first big-mouthed bite. This is definitely the kind of food you should lean forward to eat. The place also sells a selection of potato chips, water, and soda. Bring cash!

The short: Fine for a neighborhood drop-in, offering moderately priced pizza, pasta, subs, and a few Sicilian sandwiches (calzones), as well as some Greek options like gyros and baklava, but food isn't terribly exciting--and neither are the décor or staff.   The long: Located on the northwest corner of 52nd St. and Thomas, this little hole in the wall has been serving pizza, Italian, and Greek food since 1973. The restaurant interior is straightforward and frugal--you walk in and up to the counter that fronts the kitchen, peer into the cold case to the right holding Greek treats like baklava, or head to the little dining room to the left, filled with a handful of nondescript tables and chairs.   DiVito's is open Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and closed Sunday.  The offer weekday daily lunch specials for under $5. Pasta dishes for $8, including side salad and garlic bread. Pizza starting at $7.50 for a 12" cheese.   House salad was crisp. The wings hit the spot, without covering it. They were flabby skinned--cooked through, but not fried to give it a crust. I wasn't expecting it to be battered or anything, but I like a quick fry to hold the skin to the meat. The wing sauce was good enough--a bit of heat, a bit of tang, and down it went. We ordered Mama's Special: Pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, olives, mushrooms & onions. No love for the pizza crust. It was baked just right, with some nice spotty oven char on the bottom, and the crust looked like it would be great, laced with big air bubbles, but there was no chew. I wasn't expecting a big bubble gum bite, but I like a bit of chew, and with that chew, some of the flavor that tells me the dough was allowed to rest for awhile to develop. This dough yielded instantly with a bite, then quickly disintegrated in my mouth as if it were Wonder Bread. In a backwards way, it was left to be carried by the toppings, but alas, those were subpar--the lightly spread sauce (just right in quantity, bland in quality), mozzarella, sausage, black olives, mushrooms--it was all off the supermarket shelves. The Sicilian meatball sandwich had the same crust, and it was more obvious here, in plain sight, but still a wallflower. Again, more rise time, and a sprinkle of salt in the dough, and maybe we could've been friends. I liked the innards, even though it wasn't the big globes of meatballs sweating into marinara that I was expecting. The meatball meat--just nicely seasoned lean ground beef--was scooped in, filling every inch of the sandwich's cavern (no annoying air bubble cubby holes of emptiness), and sprinkled with mozzarella. Again, not great, but adequate, and everything I wish a Hot Pocket could be, if not the calzone I'd expected. The lasagna I especially wanted to love, especially with its menu tag: "the best you've ever tasted." Here, I loved the composition--not too much noodle, not too much cheese, not too much sauce inside, though the thing was really swimming in sauce when I received it. I easily sopped that up with the very tasty and perfectly crisp garlic bread, though. I liked whatever herbs they seasoned their ricotta with, and that they seasoned the ricotta at all, since it's too often neglected in lasagna dishes. I just felt like the sauce was missing something, and it fell just flat. Maybe a few glugs of wine or some minced garlic would've given it the light bite I was looking for. The desserts were also fine. The cannoli in its fried shell wasn't traditional, filled with a slightly starchy vanilla pastry cream instead of sweetened ricotta, but it was crispy and creamy and sweet. The tiramisu was tasty, but I couldn't taste any Marsala in the zabaglione, so I declared it decidedly kid-friendly.   One of the best things about DiVito's food is that it kinda tasted better the next day, reheated. *shrugs* Maybe it's one of those things that needs a night to allow the flavors to meld? With decent prices and decent food, especially when a craving hits, I won't mind going back to further test this theory. I wish I could give them 2.25 stars: "Meh, it's ok."

The short:  This really is as good as it gets when it comes to turo-turo style Filipino food--reasonably priced, tasty, generous, and authentic. The staff was welcoming, friendly, and helpful.  The long: Located in a big shopping center on the southwest corner of 35th Ave. and Dunlap, the place is fairly easy to find (in the northern arm of the center), and there's ample parking. When you walk in, you see a typical turo-turo style eatery. Turo-turo means "point point," and they use the term because the food is set up cafeteria style, all in a steam table, and all you do is point at what you'd like to eat. You can go for a one-, two-. or three-item combo served with two generous scoops of white rice. There's also a short order menu that serves some Filipino classics, including a whole "silog" menu--which is food served with eggs, usually for breakfast--and some simple American fare like burgers  There were some traditional desserts in the pastry case that served the door and about 16 items in the steam table. My boyfriend and I went for broke because I wanted to see how this food compared to the food I grew up with. We tried the pork and chicken adobo (I'd asked only for pork, but the server didn't like that she couldn't fill a whole 12-oz cup with what was left at the end of the night, she so gave us some chicken adobo in consolation), chicken curry, beef mechado (the sauce is similar to cacciatore--tomato based wit bell peppers), beef kabute (beef and mushrooms, similar to beef stroganoff), laing (stewed taro leaves, what I call the collard greens of the Philippines), and dinuguan (pork in pork blood--not for the squeamish!). The owner also asked if we'd like to try the sinigang, which is a tamarind-based fish soup. To drink we had the sago't gulaman and a mango boba. For dessert (although really, the sago't and boba should be considered dessert for those with a normal, not-homesick stomach capacity), we tried the halo-halo special.   To the point--everything tasted great. If you order on a day your body's really craving protein, you risk suffering death by pork at a turo-turo eatery, and Halo-Halo Kitchen does pork so very well--tender and flavorful. The beef dishes were also well cooked. The curry was pretty standard--the sweeter Japanese style, and the chicken legs in it were also wonderfully tender. The only problems were with the chicken adobo where the sauce was wonderful, but the meat was just a bit dry (you'd think that would be a more common problem in a steam table setup, but because most dishes are stews held at lower temps, the meat stays moist). The laing was more sour than I'm used to--not sure if it was their taro leaves (for the most part, out here, you can only find them frozen or dried), too much fermented shrimp paste (adds a salty, pungent, umami flavor in perfect amounts), or maybe too much patis (fish sauce--adds an earthier layer of the same stuff shrimp paste does), or maybe not enough coconut milk and cream. Regardless, it wasn't bad--just not as sweet as I'm used to. What made the best dishes for me, and what makes Filipino food awesome in my mind, is the sauces. Filipino food is served with rice, and the sauce just soaks into that rice and makes that perfect bite last longer. Because of my choices, we basically ended up with two plates of comfort food, and every bite was definitely comforting.   Our beverages were brought to our table after they were made a few minutes after we sat down, and the halo-halo special came as we finished our dinner. The sago't was good, although the boba grew as the night went on, so sucking it through the straw was crazy. The jelly in the sago't was tasty, though. My boyfriend's mango boba was amazing--at one point, I jokingly suggested they'd just taken some frozen mango and pureed it, but once I said it,  I was halfway convinced that they'd actually done that. The halo-halo special was also awesome. Even though it's considered a summer dessert because it's based on shaved ice, I could eat it year around. It was as good as it gets, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (it might have been jack fruit ice cream), a generous smear of ube, and a chunk of flat at the top, the sweetened condensed milk soaking into the ice, and the usual halo-halo blend at the bottom (red mung beans, jellies, palm fruit, strips of jack fruit and macapuno, etc.). Halo-halo means "mix-mix," and they set the tall plastic cup up with a dome lid and a long-handled plastic spoon so you could churn everything together into homogenized harmony.   The lady at the counter told us the turo-turo menu changes every day, so I'm looking forward to going back and trying their other food, along with all the other food we didn't have room to try. I love a good silog, and I'm sure I could find it here!

The short: Clean, comfortable, casual environment; efficient service; and ample servings of really good food!   The long: I chose Renegade Canteen for our first Restaurant Week dinner because I'd always wanted to try Robert McGrath's food at Roaring Fork, but never got the chance. I was not disappointed! Located in the Shops at 94 Hundred Shea, on the south side of Shea and just east of the busy shopping center at the very corner, Renegade Canteen is a bit tucked away in the shopping center that looks and feels more like a business park.   We showed up 30 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation on Monday, but the restaurant wasn't full, so we were seated right away at a big table with cushy seats. The decor was a little flat, but honestly, I was relieved that it wasn't heavy on the Southwestern decor. I was also grateful for the ample lighting, tall ceilings, and all the natural material within the decor that acted as buffers to suck up the ambient sound of nearby diners' conversations. Everyone around us, from business suits to couples, seemed to linger and just enjoy the ability to talk over and after dinner. I guess that's my way of saying it was nice to be in a place that didn't try to give me a concussion with way-loud music.   Our waitress, Helene, was on point all night, keeping our glasses, bread basket (tasty, crisp-crusted jalapeno cheddar bread and brown bread), and butter plate full, and the food rolling at the perfect pace, including asking us if we needed a breather before dessert (we did!). The assisting staff clearing the plates and helping to serve dishes were also quick, efficient, and unobtrusive.   The food was all almost perfect. Because it was Restaurant Week, these menu items aren't on the restaurant's permanent menu, but in my opinion, it's a mark of skill to make supplemental menu items so well. The spinach salad with a coddled egg, bacon, pine nuts, and cider vinaigrette was beautiful--a classic combo, perfectly done. Most coddled eggs I've had were overcooked, but this was just right, so beware if runny egg scares you. The mushroom crepe with veal sweetbreads and wood-roasted Portobello, with a buckwheat crepe and some very thinly shaved fennel, was earthy and savory. Maybe a little too earthy, though, as there was a teeny bit of grit in one bite of mushroom.   The grilled duck breast, wilted cabbage, and creamed corn was good. I ordered the duck rare, and the ample portion came perfectly cooked and beautifully sliced with a thin drizzle of unidentifiable and what I thought was mostly inconsequential sauce that delivered only a lick of sweetness. Weird. I do wish the dish had come on a bigger plate, since the duck slices weren't bite-sized (unless you're really ambitious), and I had to maneuver some food to make a slicing area. The veggies were all right--I liked the corn slightly punchy, vinegary sauce, which was a nice foil to the duck, but the wilted kale was too much of a bitter finish to every bite. The Dr. Pepper short rib served with succotash with local olives and bok choy was a much better entree thanks to the perfectly cooked short rib--moist and flavorful, I could cut it with a spoon and it melted in my mouth. It was also another good chunk of meat, very thick and on the bone. I could barely taste the Dr. Pepper on the rib itself, though a swipe with a slice of bread through the sauce made it really obvious. The veggies on this plate were better, with brilliant pops provided by the beans although everything tasted like green olives, save for the legumes--not Lima, but they looked like and had the sweet taste of gigantic, in-season peas.   Dessert was a beautiful finish. I ordered the chocolate malt, chocolate mousse, and flourless chocolate cake--so much chocolaty goodness on a single plate. The malt came in a tiny tumbler with a straw and demitasse spoon to scoop out the chocolate chunks floating at the top. The warm, white chocolate mousse flowed into the sunken cake when I forked into it. It was just sweet, delicious, and kill-me decadent, and honestly, I'm glad I started with it and only had to eat half before trading with my boyfriend for the lemon ricotta cheesecake with house-made limoncello he'd ordered. This was a great sweet finish to a big meal--light, sweet-tart, and summery. But don't try to eat the "candied" lemon slice--it was still bitter by the time it came to our plate, so while it was pretty, it was a shame that we couldn't eat it.   Overall, I'm glad we finally got to check this place out, and during Restaurant Week when prices aren't as brutal. Not everything was a total hit, but there were a lot of great things going on, and there were no total misses. This is on my list for special occasion dining, especially to try one of their $25 daily specials--I have my eye on the weekend paella!

The short: Delicious, tasty flavors with fresh toppings at a decent price. Service was friendly and helpful, and the shop was very clean and cheery.   The long: Living off 20th St. and Camelback, I already had two frozen yogurt places with walking distance. I'm glad to add The Chill as a third--best of all, it's the closest to my house, and I think it's most conducive to becoming a neighborhood joint (if fro-yo places could become neighborhood joints).   Immediate parking can get sketchy, especially earlier in the night when you have to compete with the patrons dining at the restaurant next door, but there's a load of parking in the big lot facing Bethany Home and around the back on the south side of the shopping center.  We stopped in to visit on a pretty chilly night, and I wasn't surprised to see the place empty aside from an employee who was busily making sure the machines were clean. As soon as we walked in, she greeted us warmly and offered sampling cups to us. I was impressed with the array of flavors--just as many as the chains with flavors just as unique and enticing.  I'll admit, I'm a sweet yogurt fan, so I neglected to try the tart, but the four flavors I tried were awesome: red velvet cake, cake batter, pistachio, and peanut butter. The cake flavors were tasty, the pistachio was fine, but for me, the peanut butter was the clear-cut winner. My boyfriend had the chocolate, mint, and coffee, and all of those were good, too. The coffee is for die-hard coffee fans--it tasted like a decent cup of good, black coffee. The consistency was smooth and firm--no icy crystals or drippiness, which are both pet peeves in any frozen dessert where those factors don't belong. The fruit looked fresh, but unless there are blueberries, I tend to go for walnuts, almonds, and granola, and those were all fresh and tasty. My boyfriend obeyes his usual sweet tooth and went for the standards: Snickers, Milky Way, mini Reeses Pieces, and chocolate chips. There were a couple dozen additional options and a shelf of the regular sauces--butterscotch, chocolate, etc.--and everything was tidy and looked good. I'm also glad that their toppings bar was an island instead of a one-sided counter so you couldn't get stuck in a line of slow toppers mulling things over. As far as price, it was comparable to the other places, and we received a flyer with coupons at our house. I've also seen other coupons for them online (Amazon.com just e-mailed a half-off deal this morning).   For a new store, I'm impressed that everything was so together. I guess the true test will be after the place has been open for a few months, especially through the cold season, to see if they keep up with the fresh toppings and well-made, yummy fro-yo flavors. We tend to make a frozen yogur run every 2 or 3 weeks, and we're looking forward to coming back here. I want to try their Cookies and Cream!

The short: Really good pizza with a crispy-chewy crust and fresh, solid ingredients--all out of a food truck! Awesome bang for your buck at about $8 for an 8-inch pie and friendly service.  The long: During downtown's First Friday Art Walk, we often snag dinner at the food trucks, usually opting for some delicious gourmet hot dogs. This month, Short Leash was absent, but Pizza People's giant dark green truck was in its place. While I was a little skeptical about getting a decent pizza out of a food truck (more specifically, the kind of oven you might be able to pack into a food truck), I need not have worried. While the 12-minute wait might have seemed long for food truck food, and while I'm no expert, the pizza was great and well worth the wait.  My boyfriend ordered the Popeye, featuring spinach, basil, garlic, tomatoes, and green onions. Luckily, they just happened to already have a Popeye, baked and boxed, and were willing to sell it to us at a discout if we were willing to buy it and wait for my pizza to bake. Of course we agreed, and we treated it as a first course while we waited for my custom sausage, green chilies, mushroom, and black olives pizza. The pizza was still nice and hot, but not so hot that we had to wait before digging in.   The toppings were awesome--fresh and ample without overwhelming the pie. The cheese had just the right amounts of give and chew. The spinach was cooked, but not cooked to mush. And the true test of pizza, the crust, was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, thick and structured enough to hold the toppings up without buckling under their weight. We devoured it, right down to and including the bones (the crust/cornicione), which I too often leave on the plate because it's usually just substandard bread. These bones were truly enjoyable. My pizza came out 12 minutes later, as promised. I personally should've laid back a little on toppings, and somehow, a sprinkling of basil chiffonade made it onto the pizza, but it was still good. However, the crust kept flopping, either because we didn't wait long enough for the pizza to cool or because it was just floppy crust. After the Popeye, I want to think it was because we should've waited just a little longer to dig in. I still really enjoyed it, though, and look forward to visiting the truck again--hopefully it will be a frequent vendor at First Fridays, Food Truck Friday, and Saturday at the Downtown Public Market!

2.5 stars  The short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff, but it's basically just-ok carby kid food.  The long: On the south side of Thomas, just west of 44th St., turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic, but it's otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up, like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise, it doesn't stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period, and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick, though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush.   I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome, even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon, the drink was so sweet, it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo, a slab of soft-in-the-inside, perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast, somewhat slightly crisp, thin crinkle cut fries, a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce), and, of course, four chicken strips. Unless you're me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two, but really, halfway through the meal, you're so carbed-out full that you don't miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken, and true to advertising, it was fresh. Sort of crispy, but not as crispy as I'd hoped, or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I can't even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally, every time I took a bite of that toast, I'd think, "This is the most random slice of toast ever. What's it even doing here?"   So, it's fine if you're like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this, but personally, I won't be making a return visit.  Edit: I almost threw my drink cup away before I noticed the giveaway pull tab on it--I won a free slice os Texas toast! How do you like them apples? =)
