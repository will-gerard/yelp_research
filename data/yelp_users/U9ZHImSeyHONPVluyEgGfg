Great coffee, friendly folks, tasty brekky (only meal I've had there) and a cool little bar area in back serving well made cocktails. What more do you need!?

Just paid $18.65 for an Irish coffee that took 20 minutes to arrive and did not include the Irish cream when it did, despite my being told it was part of the drink. The shot of Irish cream took another ten minutes, and when the bill arrived it turned out that a shot of Irish cream cost $8. For future reference please just tell folks when the constituent parts of a drink are going to be charged individually. An Irish coffee is not a $19 cocktail.

Just got my hair cut by Jordana and couldn't be happier. The salon is new and super cool, and I dig the interior and decorating. Everyone is friendly and there's tunes on to listen to while you get styled. All around a sweet lil salon staffed by awesome folks. I'll be back with more hair to chop off for sure.
