We order from here quite often. Good food at a decent price.  The staff is always friendly. They make it to order but the wait still isn't very long.  I love their pork fried rice and orange chicken. Oh,  and the portions are large.

Don't know what happened to my other review but it is worth giving another:  I actually like taking my cars here. It is the only place my boyfriend goes. I like that they keep record for us and aren't pushy about unnecessary repairs.

Angel is so rude, lazy and disrespectful.  I go to this location almost daily and typically the staff is friendly. Unfortunately, I had to interact with some guy named Angel and my previous impression quickly flew out the window.  The pump I used wasn't working so I went inside to let them know. I was expecting them to check their system or the pump,  but instead I was met with hostility. Angel kept saying it's my car without ever verifying if anything was wrong with the pump or their system. Another customer had to interject and tell him to drop his attitude. He rolled his eyes like a little girl and said whatever. I said fine I'm calling your corporate office and he replied the number is on the door so call them.  I was completely baffled.  Other customers apologized to me saying it was ridiculous. I decided to leave before I got upset. Needless to say, I filled up at 7eleven up the street. As much as I like the girls that work there, I will not be back as long as he is there.

I wanted to like this place but I have been here three times and was disappointed each time. First, they left items off my order. Then the portions are not worth the price. I don't think I will be back

Attended an event that was held here and was impressed with the service and food. I think it may have been the best non-homemade macaroni and cheese I have ever had. We played games after and we all enjoyed ourselves.
