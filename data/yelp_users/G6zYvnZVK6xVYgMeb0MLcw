Oh, El Encanto...so much promise, so little delivery.  I chose this location for my in-laws to take me on a "Bon Voyage" meal because I had been to "Dos" and heard the ambiance was even better at the Cave Creek location. After eating here, I wasn't one bit sad that I was leaving Phoenix.  If interested, you can read my review of El Encanto Dos as well. Surprisingly, the reviews are almost opposite (you'd think they'd be similar if owned by the same people).  First look, I wasn't amazed. Of course, the pond and the ducks are great, but it produces demanding birds that the net over the pond can't completely prevent. We went early in the evening on a weekday, maybe right around 5pm and it was pretty empty. Our server was very attentive at first, but strayed a bit towards the end. I'm not going to say anything else about the service; I've only been there once and I'm hoping that bad service isn't a theme with the Encanto restaurants.  The margarita...I don't remember much about it, so I"m going to say it wasn't memorable. The food was memorable, only in that it was such a bore. I got a quesadilla and could have gotten something more interesting/tastier at Denny's. In fact, I was really astounded at the boringness of the food. Everyone I was with at the table said that they thought the meal was lacking in a way.  This visit took place in mid-May 2010, and I'm not sure if they had just gotten a new cook, or had some other issue. That is the only time I've been there, so I can't testify to much...but when I go back to visit Phoenix, I won't be going to El Encanto.

Best Pizza in Anthem, for sure. Not sure how exactly to explain it, and it isn't "rock your entire world" level pizza...but it's good. We get something like a "meat-lover's pizza" (my husband's choice, of course). And though I don't usually love sausage and all that meat, this pizza is really good.  We also love the antipasti salad--highly recommend a large pizza and a salad, for only two people we always have leftovers.

Wow. I never thought I'd be such a fan of a grocery store, but this is an amazing store. It's well-lit, well-laid-out, has the nicest staff in the history of chain stores, and has pretty much everything I want or need from a grocery store (except that it's not a Trader Joe's, but what can you do?).  Seriously...great, fresh produce...well-stocked shelves, huge selection of everything you want, great prices and even better sales (I bought a Thanksgiving turkey there for like $7 once--BEFORE Thanksgiving!). They also have an excellent pharmacy area, and even furniture and accessories, including area rugs. And grills and outdoor furniture!

I had a mailbox here for about a year, and had a great experience. Since I came in several times a week, I got to know the staff and they were quite helpful. Living in Anthem, you can feel really far away from everything, but this store had shipping services, US Postal Services (though they charge a bit extra). They have notary services as well and everyone on staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  A great thing about this location is that with your special key, you can get in to your mailbox even when they are closed. Also, the location can't be beat--you can hit the UPS store, grocery store, grab a Starbucks, some sushi or mexican food or pizza, get your dry cleaning, even get a massage--all in one trip!
