Awesome vibe and decor, even better food. When you sit down, you're served water with lemon, watermelon, mint and raspberries in it. Yum! The food is super fresh tasting! I got the beef pho & you can tell it doesn't have any MSG- it's not salty at all so a bit surprising at first but it's way better!! The owner is super friendly and walks around table to table chatting with customers. She was hugging the regulars and taking time to get to know people. Best part- it's BYOB! I highly recommend this restaurant!

This place is wonderful! They are honest and never offer repairs that aren't needed. They give you a time frame so you can plan ahead and budget for it. I take my car there for irregular repairs but also general maintenance and I've found they are usually quicker than they estimate. If they tell you it will take about 2 hours, they'll call sooner & tell you your car is done. I love that! They do all the same repairs as the Toyota dealership I was originally taking my car to but for much less money and hassle. I highly recommend Network Automotive.

Love this location. Their options and ingredients are way better than most other places in my opinion. There's plenty of seating and it looks like it's been recently renovated or updated slightly so it looks really nice. Overall, we were really impressed.

My husband and I visited the Arizona Opry with our grandparents. We're in our mid-thirties and were definitely the youngest people there in a room of 500 people.  I went with low expectations but we're leaving pretty impressed actually.  The main performer (George) was amazingly talented and we could have watched him all day.  Many of the other men were also terrific although I don't recall their names.  They each perform multiple instruments and the music is a huge variety.  We both knew all the songs except two so they stick to the most popular ones.  Yes, it's a little cheesy but it was also cute and entertaining.  Also, the food was delicious and like others noted, the portions were plenty.    My only complaint is the one female singer from today- she was terrible. I guess she was one of the twins who actually owns the place so I feel like everyone knows she's a bad performer but she's the owner so who's really going to tell her? It was bad.  She brought the quality of the whole performance way way down.  Imagine one of Kristin Wiig's characters from Saturday night live that seems so over the top it's hard to watch then realize that's exactly this lady for real.   When I asked my hubby what stars he would give them he said "4.5 or 5 surprisingly" but because of her we are only giving 4 stars.   I wouldn't go there with a bunch of friends but when family comes into town and I'm at a loss for things to do, it's actually a good option.

I visited The Orange Table for lunch mid-summer with a client and overall was pleased. Finding it is nearly impossible, we walked around for quite a while. So we were hot and famished when we finally got there!  We both ordered the chicken salad sandwich (I ordered mine without bread- so a salad). It was definitely not your typical chicken salad. It had a bit of a kick to it but I really liked it. It was just surprising but I would certainly go back and order it again. My client also liked hers.  My only complaint was the seating. We sat at one table and it was lopsided so we switched tables and that one was the same way. You know when you stick napkins under one leg? Yeah, like that. We just stuck it out but it's definitely something they could pay closer attention to.  I also ordered a latte on the way out which was delicious and the service was fast as well.

If you go there on a Friday or Saturday night, the place is packed! Oh, and if you go there at lunch time, it's packed too! That's because IT'S WORTH THE WAIT! The food is delicious, the portion sizes are adequate, and the staff is fast and friendly. Great restaurant!

My office is in Old Town Scottsdale so I have a lot of options for lunch. This little place is by far my favorite! My "usual order" is the "Man Salad" which is just amazing- lots of protein and good fats to keep you full all afternoon!  They are always so friendly EVEN when they're busy. The thing I like most, however, is simply how consistent they are. The salad is the same every time, their service is excellent every time, and they are as fast as possible every time. You see them hustling to get orders done as quickly as they can. The place is really just wonderful- keep doing what you're doing guys!

Love this place. Huge portions for the money and great lunch specials. We've been there a few dozen times and everything, from the service, to the food, to the wait time is consistent which I like.

My husband and I went to Posh last night for our anniversary. We both agree that it was the best meal we've ever eaten. I had Kangaroo as one of my meals which I can't believe but everything I had was just so delicious. We did the 4 courses which was plenty for us. We each ordered a drink. Our total was about $132 which is pricey but it was SO worth it.   The concept is so much fun! I admit I was a little nervous going in but now I can't wait to go back. I plan to start making up "special occasions" so I have an excuse to return! You have no idea what you're going to eat when you go but you will not disappointed. Trust me.   The atmosphere was another great part of our experience. There wasn't any music so it was quiet and we could hear each other to have a conversation. The service was outstanding- they're attentive but not constantly interrupting either. It's a nice place but some people were wearing jeans, others were dressed up... it's a great spot no matter the reason!  I highly recommend Post Improvisational Cuisine in Scottsdale.

I do not practice yoga. I've gone to a few classes but never consistently. I love being active and found some yoga classes too boring for me. I tried Bikram which was good for a few months then I got bored with the same sequence. I went to my first class today at Yoga Nirvana and cannot believe how pleased I am. The flow through the poses was challenging yet not impossible. The instructor was extremely helpful- he didn't draw attention to me yet gave advice and aid when I needed it. He was extremely friendly when I first walked in as were the other participants in the class. I've walked in to other yoga studios and there's an "air" about the people that I didn't like. I had a great workout this morning but also felt a deep stretch and a calmness to my mind- 3 things that I think are difficult to find in one class. I also thought the instructor had a perfect balance between talking and not talking. Some instructors never shut up and others guide through the poses but don't provide anything else. Today's class was perfect. I highly recommend Yoga Nirvana to any newbie looking to try yoga!

My new favorite - just strenuous enough but just short enough that it doesn't take long. It's just a few miles off the freeway so very easy to get to. We went on a Saturday morning & parking was still easy.

I'm so annoyed with this gym. My husband was working out there for 6 mths and had a membership for $19.99/mth. We went on Valentine's Day for me to sign up and they offered us a special for BOTH of us if we prepaid one year. We were explained one year no fees no charges for both of us (and it's written that way on our contract). They "cancelled" his old membership and gave me mine.   We went a few months without any problems. All of a sudden last month, they start charging our credit card for my husband's monthly $19.99 membership. We have to go in there, have them reverse it. The manager says the guy who sold us the membership was an idiot (his words) and has since been fired (should they even disclose this?). He said he did the paperwork wrong but that's not our fault. They need to honor what we signed and what's written on our contract.    How difficult can it be? And how many months do we need to come in there and have them fix it before they figure it out?  Also, the gym is soooo hot. When you're working out, the temp is way too high and they need to turn the A/C on higher. It's as if they heat/cool the place for the employees and not the people working out who actually pay to do so.

Shanna Tingom is an amazing person AND financial advisor! She's positive, responsive, thorough, and ethical. I've referred quite a few clients to her and they've all been very pleased. She's humble and attentive in her approach to her clients' needs. She puts their needs in front of her own. If you live in the East Valley area, Shanna should be your go-to advisor. She also went out of her way to meet w/ one of my clients who lived over an hour away in the west valley! Call her and I know you'll be impressed!

I came on here to leave Becca a positive review and was SHOCKED to read the negative ones posted. I can't believe we're even talking about the same realtor because my experience with her has been amazing.  Becca helped my husband and I find a rental home when we needed it. The listing agent was terrible to work with but Becca stayed positive and on top of things every step of the way. Once we got into the home, we began experiencing issues w/ the property manager (we should have known, she's just a weird lady). But Becca has been a wonderful resource for me. I call or email Becca and get a response right away. She gives me advice, answers my questions, and has even called the property manager on my behalf, all things she does not need to do but still does.   As my husband and I begin looking for a home to buy, Becca has been wonderful to work with as well. There was 1 day my husband and I could go view houses unexpectedly and Becca made it work- she cleared her schedule so she could make it work for us.   Becca has a very honest approach... She's going to answer questions truthfully and not just tell someone what they want to hear. My theory is that maybe some people don't want this or don't like this about her... but for me, it's a quality I respect and cherish because I know she's steering me right. Becca has been a great realtor for me and Michael!

I wanted to take a minute to update my review now that we've officially closed on our house. I look back over the past few months (we requested a long close) with Becca as our realtor and I honestly can't think of even one negative or one piece of constructive criticism. I am so incredibly happy with my experience and I want everyone to know it!   Becca's knowledge and extensive experience is definitely her strength. She was able to educate us and explain every possible outcome at each phase so that we were prepared no matter what. She would say, "We're going to request X and you can expect A, B, or C to happen." And since I'm a planner, I would then make her explain to me what the next steps could possibly be for each of those outcomes too! I never felt bad for asking "stupid" questions. I never once felt like I was bothering her. I never once felt as if she was talking down to me or was not being completely honest and transparent with her thoughts and advice.   The sellers agreed to make a number of repairs and Becca was on top of them every step of the way. I never had to ask, "So where are we at with things?" She would email or communicate with me before I ever had to inquire. I had no doubt she was on top of things from the minute we began house hunting. I had the utmost confidence in her and it made the whole process easy and stress-free.  We had a number of contractors meet us at the house pre-close to begin gathering bids for some work we wanted done. There was a couple miscommunications ON MY END and TWICE I called Becca and said, "Umm...I'm at the house w/ a contractor right now, any chance you can come let us in?" She lived 20 minutes away yet she didn't hesitate to meet me at the house. She was a lifesaver more than once.  I cannot recommend Becca enough as a realtor. Our home purchase will always be remembered as such a positive experience thanks to Becca!

I love Gerald and the team at Pool Steward. They are friendly, knowledgable and all around a wonderful company to work with.Gerald takes the time to make sure the chemicals are perfectly balanced; he doesn't just throw chlorine in the water to shock it! For the level of service he provides, I'm amazed at how competitive his rates are because I think he goes above and beyond. I have referred him to dozens of friends, family members and clients and they all love him! I never thought I'd sing the praises of a pool guy but he is just so professional that I had to take a minute to give a review.

Yup, I'm writing a review on a CHAIN pizza joint and giving it 5 STARS INDEED! This location totally deserves 5 stars!   They are super fast, super friendly and they make things right if anything ever goes wrong, which is rare. Oh, and the pizza is delicious. I ordered 3 large pizzas to feed my friends who were helping us move and everyone raved at how great it tasted. They said, "THIS is Little Caesar's?" They weren't just being nice, they were genuinely surprised at how tasty the 3 different pizzas were that we ordered.  Just go there over lunch and you'll see how busy this location is- it's because they're doing things right! They have great lunch specials too- way cheaper than Barro's.

My husband and I visited Calistro's for our anniversary a couple of weeks ago. We heard it was a paleo-friendly place to eat so we definitely wanted to check it out. We are pretty picky with our food which can be embarrassing sometimes we don't eat out a lot.   The place wasn't super busy but there were a number of tables full when we arrived. They came to the table right away and the server was very informative in helping me choose my meal. It was a new menu (put in place a week prior he said) yet he was very knowledgable about each dish. I chose the Lamb meatloaf and my husband had the pork chops.   Both of us really enjoyed our food. It wasn't boring but the flavors compliments each other very well. The server was attentive, the atmosphere great, and the manager came over as well. He talked to us for a little while and wasn't just friendly but seemed genuinely sincere with making sure we had a good experience.  We've told our friends about Calistro's since and we'll definitely be back.

Goodness gracious, this place makes me blow my diet!! Those ATL style wings & the ATL fries- I simply cannot pass them up. They are sooooo good! I've tried some of the other flavors and they're also good but I keep going back to the ATL. Also go inside and drink Kool-Aid. I mean, it's like reliving your childhood and simply amazing! I wish there were more locations around the valley because it's a little out of the way for us but there are days where no length of drive will stop me from eating there if I'm having a craving!

It has taken me a while to figure out exactly what to say during this review. My husband and I were tenants in a house managed by Gina's office for almost 2.5 years.  My biggest complaint is the poor communication that comes from Gina's office. I submitted a request via the online portal and never received a response.  After 2 weeks I emailed Gina, still no response. I waited 3 more weeks then emailed again and the response I got said, "I do not handle these requests please contact the office directly." Really? She couldn't A) Forward my response to the correct person (who is her husband) or B) Give the person who is responsible a head's up that there's a maintenance request in the system that requires follow up? I found it to be unprofessional that she would push it back on me when I had done what was asked and at that point they had already dropped the ball.  As the tenant, I guess one could say that she had no reason to care what I thought but I know the owners had similar communication issues as well. One day the owner called (we had each other's cell phone numbers) and asked if Gina's office had reached out to me regarding some questions she had. I said no and that I had no missed calls to which she replied, "I asked them 3 times to contact you and they still havent? I can't believe it." The owners and I took to talking and resolving most things on our own and simply took Gina out of the middle. If I were the owner and I had paid for property management services I would have been surely upset. The owner chose to sell the house after we moved out and she did not use Gina as a realtor if that tells you anything.  My second complaint is that they seem to try and make things more difficult than they need to be. They are not flexible or friendly in their approach at all. It's quite odd they would even want to do business that way IMO but maybe that's the Midwest gal in me talking. The list of bizarre dealings with them is simply too long to list here but one example is that we had our move out inspection scheduled for 2pm on a Tuesday. We asked to be present during the walk thru, which is our right. (It took 6 weeks and countless emails and calls just to get a response on when they wanted to do it.) The day and time were confirmed well in advance in writing. We pull up a few minutes early and wait in the car. At 2pm their assistant pulls up and says "We did the inspection this morning and need you to sign this." ??? No explanation they just chose to violate the plan that was in place and didn't bother to notify us.   You may be thinking I'm just a disgruntled tenant who didn't receive her security deposits back, I can assure you that's not the case. We took excellent care of the home as if it were ours and we received our full deposit back.

This is my favorite coffee shop to visit when I need to get out of my office & a change of scenery is in order. My husband and I also enjoy going there on a Saturday or Sunday morning, getting a coffee and sitting and reading or chatting. I haven't been there at night yet to get wine or appetizers but I'm sure it's great too. The coffee is delicious and the prices are pretty typical. The girls there are consistently friendly and gracious. I'll go pick a table and if my drink is ready before I head back up to the counter, they walk it out to you. Just a nice touch I think. They also have a punch card, something Dunkin' Donuts doesn't have which is another nice benefit.   They have outlets along each wall so you can plug in a computer or laptop. They play music but not too loudly or obnoxiously.

This place...it's all about the little things I swear! I started here using a groupon for a teeth cleaning w/ full x-rays since I don't have dental insurance. They were friendly and efficient both when scheduling and upon arrival. Most importantly, they were ON TIME. I was taken back and the hygienist was gentle and really friendly. She tried to get to know me and didn't "rush" through the cleaning. The doc came in & mentioned a few things I needed to have done but was honest about the time frame, gave me a printout of the estimate so I could plan for it and was thorough. The entire appointment was smooth from start to finish.  Later I had an old retainer come off from my orthodontist days (15 years prior). It was cemented in. I called & they had me in right away, the doc decided it was something he could repair on his own. He charged me $50 to clean the teeth before putting the retainer back on then cementing the retainer. In, Out, Inexpensive, and a job well done. Love it!  You're not going to walk in and see marble pillars or anything fancy but the service and efficiency is most important and you won't be disappointed.

Jessica and the rest of the team at ACP Accounting have been my accountants for years. I'm extremely detail-oriented and picky, I go through my numbers with a fine-toothed comb and I trust Jessica completely!!   When my husband & I were scheduled to close on a house and I needed some tax information in an emergency, Jessica walked me through what to do while she was sitting in the chair at the dentist's office!! She was getting her teeth cleaned & asked them to stop for a minute while she helped me. Can you believe that? What amazing service!!!  What accountant do you know that would do that for you?!? I couldn't believe it. I was able to get what I needed and close on the house as scheduled.   Jessica has been a great consultant for me with my business as well. During our semi-annual financial review, she asks thought-provoking questions, provides significant feedback and takes the time to answer all my questions while acting as a sounding board.   I'm so impressed with ACP Accounting, I can't imagine I'll ever have another accountant.

The only reason I'm not giving this place 1-star is because our waiter was actually really funny and seemed like a good guy. I believe the slow service was less his fault and more the kitchen taking forever (how long does it take to fry some buffalo bites?).  We had never been here before but me & 3 girlfriends wanted to meet up for happy hour so we chose this place after buying a Groupon. After they seated us, they told us they were having a wine-tasting that night and could not accept the groupon. They said you had to call ahead and because "they were soooo busy" they couldn't honor it. The owner (I think she's the owner) came over and honestly, she was just so snooty. She wanted us to sign up for the wine tasting where we could talk with an actual wine maker, but we were there to catch up and talk to each other so we weren't interested. She made it sound as if we were inconveniencing her by wanting to eat and drink at her establishment.   There wasn't a single point in the evening where the place was full so I'm not sure why they couldn't honor the groupon. It makes no sense to me and I blame the owner lady who I think just wanted us to sign up for the stupid wine-tasting.   At about 5:50PM, we realized happy hour specials ended in 10 minutes so we asked our waiter to wait a few minutes then put in another round of wine for all of us. He said, "I can't wait to put in orders. I have to put them in right away when I get them." WHAT??? Why? Says who? Here's another STUPID rule this establishment seems to have that makes no sense...  Like many of the other reviews, the service was incredibly slow. It took forever to get the food we ordered, forever to get another glass of wine, forever to get the bill, etc. Luckily we were there to just relax and chat and weren't under a time crunch. We were there for a few hours, had a few glasses of wine AND bought food- our bill was over $150 but I left feeling as if they would have rather us paid $20 to do a wine-tasting that we weren't interested in.  Overall, really disappointed in the environment and the owner's approach to talking with customers. We all agreed that we likely would not return- there are too many other places just like it that are actually friendly.

Very clean and spacious restaurant. You walk in and it smells so good! Nandini has THE ONLY buffet I will eat at. Normally I don't like buffets but over lunch, their buffet is a fave of mine. It's inexpensive ($7.95 I believe at the time of this review) and has great food and most of my favorite Indian dishes, plus it comes with naan delivered to your table.  The location is convenient- just a mile or so off the 101 at Broadway. The owner has been there every time we've gone and he's extremely friendly and talkative. I highly recommend this restaurant!

Kimberly is absolutely amazing! She's incredibly friendly and positive but she's not afraid to get her hands dirty & get the job done too! She's always professional, always on top of things and always does right by her clients. I recommend Kimberly as your real estate agent - you will not be disappointed!

I love coming home to my house after Going Greenhouse has been there. My floors look absolutely amazing- I don't know how they get them to look that good. And my husband asked, "How do they get the fridge that clean?" (it has a stainless steel front) The girls are always very respectful and courteous and I've found that their rates are incredibly competitive especially since they use all green products. They even take a minute to play and say hi to my 2 dogs who just love when the girls come by.   The best part is when April, the owner, came by the very first time to talk to me about what I wanted done. It's really customizable so if you have something that's sort of your "pet-peeve", they can make sure to address it for you. I just love that! After they came a couple of times, April, the owner, came back by to check on the quality of the work once the girls were done. Their commitment to service and quality really shows.  If you're looking for a company that is locally-owned, licensed, insured, etc AND pays their staff an appropriate hourly rate while offering training & other benefits, Going Greenhouse is perfect!! I cannot say enough positive things about Going Greenhouse. They definitely earned their 5-stars!!

I'm really surprised to see I'm the first to review this amazing small business.  I love just sitting and relaxing near our pool after Kenny leaves-it practically sparkles!  We have a tree in our backyard that does not make his job easy but he never complains.  He's there every week and we never have any issues in between visits with the pool turning green or anything like that.  He's really friendly to our dogs and although I'm usually gone when he comes, if I am there I see him take a few extra minutes to play with my 2 dogs, say hi to them and pet them.  He's really friendly and just an all around good guy when we do chat.  I hope his business does well and if you're looking for a reliable pool guy you'll give him a call. You won't be disappointed.
