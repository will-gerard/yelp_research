Great dinner with friends.  Michael and I enjoyed the Blue Moon special, blue fin tuna fresh that morning from Spain.  The most delicious roll Michael and I ever tasted!

It's been over a year and my daughters and I will only have Scott do out nails.  Scott is a PERFECTIONIST, his work is always OUTSTANDING!  Scott will not allow us to leave his shop unless we are happy and satisfied.  My gel nails last as long as 4-5 weeks without ever lifting.  They are always shiny, strong and worth the money and time.  Lee is the cutest lady who performs the most amazing foot massages.  I always look forward to pedicures when Lee give them.  I wish I could get them all the time!  I refer ALL my family, friends and acquaintances.  Pearl Nails is the best nail shop in town!!!

Street parking is not fun, only a 15 minute wait for a table, the ambience was romantic, the antipasta and pizza was tasty and the customer services was fantastic!

Great date night with Michael.  We enjoyed the summer special, salad, pizza and wine for $20.  I LOVED the thin crust, it reminded us of our favorite pizza from LaMaddalena, Italy.  I suggest to offer red pepper/spicy oil to drizzle over the thin crust pizza.  That's what we remember from living in Italy, it's so yummy!  The artichoke and portobella mushrooms was delicious!

My 11 yr old son enjoyed his bday lunch at Famous Dave's.  We were a party of 9 and ordered two "Feast" from the menu.  Teresa our server had outstanding customer service.  The food was served on two LARGE trash lids, very fun.  We all enjoyed TASTY bbq ribs, kielbasa, chicken, brisket, corn muffins, cole slaw, and beans.  We will go back again, especially for the delicious french fries.  Plenty of food, we had leftovers for the next day:)

I was so surprised to receive my order of pulled pork enchilladas...the two enchilladas were very small and the pork was hard as a rock.  They remade my order, but the wait was really not worth every bite.  I will not order mexican dishes from here.  There beautful breakfast portions are usually worth the wait & price.  Also, my tomato juice was warm.  I had to ask for ice. Very disappointing visit this time.

This store offers the ABSOLUTE WORST exchange & return store policy.   I do not recommend spending your money here.   Customer service is very poor.   Shop online if you can!

A little more than we wanted to spend on coffee and breakfast burritos, but very good.  We will visit again.

Last week I met my family at H2K for dinner.  I enjoyed the dinuguan and sisig with rice and for dessert I shared a Halo Halo with my mom.  I am alway happy after leaving this place:)  I look forward to the next visit!

My daughter and I enjoyed the vanilla creme brulle for a late dessert.  We will go again!  Instead of the small chocolate biscotti they should slice a raspberry or two for color:)

We have ended up at this buffet a couple of times because it was in the area.  However, the customer service is terrible everytime.  It is way over priced for the quality of their food.  We are never satisfied when we leave this place.

Nice open space.  Waitress needs to wear shoes not flip flops.  Ordered onion rings, but forgot to bring them to us.  We had a coupon for $7.99 fish fry, small three pieces.  The cole slaw was soggy, surprisingly the french fries were good.  Michael and I ordered gin & tonics, well drinks were $3.00 during happy hour.  You get what you pay for...they dont use the good gin.  We will not go back for the cocktails.

The selection of tea is AWESOME!  I don't go to the store to buy their tea pots or accessories just the tea maybe in the future.  The flavors are so fulfilling and healthy at the same time.  I was happy to see Robin relocate from Scottsdale Fashion Square to Kierland Commons.  She is not pushy.  She is very informative and pleasant.  She answers all my questions and makes suggestions.  I also purchase Teavana online and that is another option if you don't like the sales talk.  My favorite is Monkey Picked Oolong along with MANY others:)

My Matcha Tea Latte is in a really BIG cup.  Outstanding customer service.  Wish the location had a scenery or in the inside of the plaze.

Great location, but food is very basic.  There were pictures on a digital frame with no names or description.  The Scottsdale roll was good, the chicken terryaki bowl was nice and spicy, the salad bowl with miso soup was tasty, the Killer Shrimp roll was good, but the chicken wrap was very basic (something my kids could make at home)  The whole family was disappointed to leave still hungry.  Not our favorite place.

We loved Raising Cane's when we visited Vegas and wished we had this place in Phoenix.  Our wish came true! New hot spot, the parking lot was full of RC customers (we had to park across the street @ Olive Garden), chicken is hot and crunchy like we remembered in Vegas location, friendly customer service and friendly & fun atmosphere.  We now wish for a location close to North Scottsdale:) Whenever we are in Phx, we will stop for some yummy RC!
