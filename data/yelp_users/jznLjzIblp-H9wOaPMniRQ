The Colorado burrito is the best and what great beef tacos! The location is a little inconvenient as they share a small parking lot with 2 other businesses bit the food is. Awesome!

Fantastic gyros, amazing fries and MUSHROOMS! I have been going here since it opened about 8 years ago and it's still out of this world!

WOW!! My Mom used to make us pasty's when we were kids, unfortunatley they were never this good! The Bangers and Mash was excellent, M\my wife had the Shepards Pie which she loved! You can never go wrong here with the beer/cider choices, Strongbow & Boddingtons on tap. I will definately return.

This location is the WORST! I love 3p's pizza but I can't stand this location. If you complain about the service to a manger they will tell you flat out that you are wrong!

This location is a pain in the ass! You want a burrito? Be prepared for them to take up to 30 minutes to figure out they didn't make your order.  I love Filiberto's and will start visiting a different location.

Susan the manager is amazing! She does a great job and always has a smile on her face. The selection of specifically shoes has gotten much better at this location over the years and they continue to widen the variety and style of clothing they carry.

I love going here for a quick lunch, $3 for 2 huge slices of cheese pizza and a drink! Props to the owners for closing on Sundays! The Christina's Calzone is amazing I am not one to boast over items with no meat in them but for a Catholic on a Friday this was PERFECT!  The Staff is wonderful and you will most likely be served by one of the owners when you go.  SUPPORT LOCAL!
