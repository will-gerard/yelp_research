I took my 4 yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week.  The nice vet who examined her told us that she might have to have 1-2 teeth extracted, BUT they would call me before doing so.  Instead, the next day, I received a call letting me know all NINE of her front teeth had been pulled.  I can't believe the audacity of pulling all of her front teeth without getting my approval first.  Whether or not the vet believed this was the best for my dog, I should have been given the option.  And, if I had, I would have chosen something much less invasive for now.  Imagine if this had happened to a human child.  My poor pup, with no teeth at only 4 yrs old.  And it's irreversible.  I HATE them for not giving me the option by calling me first.

Yum! I've only eaten here twice so far, but sad I didn't discover it yrs ago. The bacon cheddar burger is fantastic and heavily topped with so many condiments & toppings, cooked to order. And unbelievably priced. What a fantastic deal, seriously.  My only complaint is those burgers are so good they keep me from trying the other choices there and at the 3 neighboring shops (all under one roof, all owned by the same guy who also owns all the Long Wongs) delicious sounding/looking selections.

Love this little, unusual sandwich place with the nicest owner, Carol. Fantastic tasting sandwiches that she happily custom orders. Really yummy, I can't wait to try more of those tasty little pouches. I will say though they are a little on the small side; and, their juice/sparkling water could use a lot better selections, but Carol and her genuine friendliness make up for it for this rating.
