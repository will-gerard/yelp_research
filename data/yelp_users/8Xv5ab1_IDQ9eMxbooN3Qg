Alright, I want to provide a fair review of this complex as I felt there were none available to me when I moved in last summer.   So, let's get a basic rundown. It's a large complex with a variety of floor plans between studio and two bedroom. Some of the units have carpet while others were upgraded to wood. I lived in the largest one bedroom.  Pro: - In theory, utilities being included can be helpful to folk trying to save money or who have bad credit. However, in the summer my AC has always left a lot to be desired and the air does not go below the mid-80s I believe. And no, this isn't a malfunction. I have them check my AC every six or so weeks. - Square footage isn't bad for the largest one bedroom. It's 780 sq feet and in the living room and kitchen, the floor plan is open. - A semi-private entry way if you live in the larger one bedrooms. I have one person next to me and two below.  - There are 3 pools? I have never used them, but I guess that's a pro if that's important to you. - A lot of families live in this complex. Now, this is more of a pro if you have kids and want them to make friends. If not, you can put it below. - They always have weird rent specials. Live low-cost move ins and waived deposits. - Pet rent is $10 if you have a pet. The deposit is 150/150. - They participated in the summer food program last year for low income families.   Neutral: - My friends have said they feel unsafe in the complex but I've never had that concern. It's old and not particularly well kept, but I've never worried about my unit. - Location wise it's not bad. It's across the street from Larry C Kennedy to the east and homes to south.   Con: - By far the biggest con is the office staff and their conflict resolution skills. Look, I get it, dealing with stressed out tenants all days is not fun, but all of these women are impolite and always look at you as if you're bothering them by coming into the office. - Maintenance. Just, dear lord. The one guy I've met is really nice, but the process is a nightmare. Every request I make I have to follow up on multiple times before anything is done, and there is no follow through or follow up by the office staff. They need to completely overhaul their system because it's inefficient and awful. - This place is OLD. The counters are so ugly and the carpet in my unit was in bad shape. - Exterior walls are brick patterned. This is a stylistic preference, but I think it's ugly. Also, the ceiling lights have a plug that runs down the wall that is an eyesore. - Rent cannot be paid online, or if it can, there is a fee. - Certain parts of the complex are loud during the day. - The kitchen keeps in theme with being old. The appliances are ancient. The stoves are gas, which is cool tho.  Price wise, I just noticed the complex is trying to charge new renters $811 for the 780sqft unit. It's absolutely not worth that much. When I asked about renewal, they said my rent would go up by $25 even though the unit below is empty and all the units parallel to my building are empty. This complex has a catch 22. The people who need this complex can't afford it and the people who can afford it can do much better. One year was enough for me.

Living in Biltmore/Arcadia, it's nice to have some local spots to enjoy vegan munchies. Loving Hut has nice staff and the menu is great. It's definitely an orient-vegan style restaurant, so if you're not a fan of Asian food, then there's less options. The prices aren't bad, though, and they have some vegan desserts, too.

I've been here maybe five or six times. Every time I come here the service is really bad. I'll come with friends for food and hookah. The waitresses don't check on water or drinks or to see if you want more. The hookah service is a little better, but not by much. I like the food for the most part and there are decent amount of the vegetarian options, but overall this is my least favorite hookah bar.

King Tuts isn't a huge bells and whistles sorta lounge, but it makes up for it in personality. It's a comfortable place you can smoke with friends and feel right at home.

A little on the pricey side, but the TLT is to die for if you're a vegetarian. It's definitely got an air of trendiness and it's a little expensive, but it's good food and a good time, so I can't ding it.

Protip - getting a fruit tsoynami with chocolate chip is a great life choice. Right next to Green, Nami has a diverse array of vegan desserts. They're definitely a little over sweet, but if you keep your sweet tooth in tow then you're in for a treat.   Just a note that there isn't always a lot of space to sit.

Green is a vegetarian staple for residents of the Valley. With a diverse array of options, they cater to every palate. I'm a huge fan of the Big Wac, but I loved the No Harm Chicken Parm when I was a student at NAU and would visit home. The only complaint I have is that they're a pretty small location, but this will hopefully change as they continue to expand.

Bragg's is an adorable little restaurant in Encanto serving up unique vegan cuisine. I got their veggie burger, which was good, but it was their strawberry jalapeno pie that was peculiar and phenomenal. The owners were quite nice and the atmosphere is quaint and rather endearing.
