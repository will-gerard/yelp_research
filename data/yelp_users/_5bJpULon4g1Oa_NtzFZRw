HONEST, nice, quick and fair prices! this is all you could ask for in any service that you need done and dan delivers. I have been there twice because I am clumsy with my iphone and he makes it like new every time. If you have done the research on screen repair you know its waaaaay expensive, but with sun cellular thats just not the case. telling everyone I know with a cracked iphone case. If only i was in phx still....

Awesome, awesome, awesome! Food is phenomenal and the guac is worth ordering. Won't be disappointed! I have now been there twice and cant wait to go back again. Torta: awesome. Tacos: awesome. Chicken dish thing that I cant remember the name?: awesome. boxed up what we didnt eat, and forgot it on the table. The server ran out to the road as we were driving to give it to us...are you kidding me? how sweet is that? go. now.

The patio could not be any more perfect. That alone is worth eating there. The food and service were great. Took mom there for her birthday lunch- she was looking forward to the French onion soup ( it's her favorite) but wasn't available - they were " transitioning"  into summer and that means no onion soup till the fall. Food was still fantastic AND when I told the server it was her birthday and asked for a candle or something at dessert, he brought out a tea light on our brûlée. Said he couldn't find any birthday candles but didn't want to dissapoint- so so so very sweet and appreciated. Nothing wrong with a little improvisation and creativity! Great place to take mom or ladies who lunch. Can't wait to try the Sunday brunch and dinner menu. Will be back for sure.

Strong pour on the margarita ( a good thing)! and that is it. The food was unimpressive and not worth it. Good for drinks on the patio. thats it
