For less than what it costs to eat at McDonalds, you can have the best lunch in town.

I took a late lunch and arrived at 2pm to pick up a package, only to find the line was out the front door.  Since I didn't have an hour to wait I returned at 4:36pm only to learn that unlike most post offices this one closes at 4:30pm.  If you have a job you might have a hard time picking up your mail.
