The food is very delicious, but they will not do separate checks and the waitress was very annoyed when we tried to split the bill.

We had a wonderful time at the Firesky Resort. The room was beautiful with a lovely view of the pool. We spent the day at the pool and Aaron the Pool Ambassador was so wonderful to us. He was constantly checking on us to make sure we had drinks and were comfortable. He was also very nice to talk with. The pool was beautiful and so relaxing. Highly recommend spending a weekend at Firesky.

This place said they were open until 10 and we went at 9 and they were closed! So disappointed and such a waste of time.

This is such a fun nail bar! Went here with a bridal party and were treated wonderfully. The people are so nice and helpful and the atmosphere is very fun.
