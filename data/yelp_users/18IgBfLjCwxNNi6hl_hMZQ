Tried the spicy ramen with egg and beef.  I lived in Tokyo and I have tried many different types of ramen.  I didn't have high expectations but I thought it was good.  I will definitely go there again.

Just came home with five orders of Pho and few apps..Called in at 7 pm. Told me 15 min to get picked up. Got there and waited until 745. Didn't mind the wait, cool place.  Problem is when I got home. Who puts Noodle in the hot broth on a to go order? Noodles are so soggy and nasty that I can only eat with spoon. Gave two stars because apps were decent. Pho had good flavor but ruined because of soggy noodles.

Delicious Korean food. Great find !  Ask for kimchi if you want some. Support Korean food!  I came across this restaurant by accident. Glad I checked it out.
