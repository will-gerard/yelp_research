I have been highly disappointed with this car wash! I really wanted them to be good because they're so close to my work and it's so convenient.   I've taken my car here a few times for washes, and oil changes, I always end up paying waaay more than originally quoted. Fine, I'm a female and they upsell my oil changes- I might need all the extra crap they try to get out of me, but a 39 dollar oil change was 180 when I paid. Ugh! but the last time I came in was for a detail.   I called ahead to inquire about the price of having my interior shampooed- I specified both the floor and upholstery. She quoted me 79 over the phone. I usually go to a car wash in North Scottsdale for my shampoos but like I said, this place is close to my job, real close, and they usually charge me 49. So I bit the extra price for convenience but after arrival I was convinced that my car wouldn't be clean unless I purchased the full detail which was on special. He offered me a  deal on this so I agreed. The deal price was 169, which would have been fine if the car was clean when I picked it up 3 hours later but it was not. There was still dog hair in the upholstery, my windows were smudged and streaky, and my wet car mats were moldy from being in the trunk, I was told when I picked it up to leave the mats in the trunk for a day because they were dry but the floor was not. I had to bring my car back twice to remedy this. Not impressed.

Dunkin donuts aren't my favorite donuts, I'm more of a K-Kreme kinda girl but the employees at this store are the best! They truly are the best example of customer service! It's clear that they are a direct example of the manager here who is amazingly friendly, patient and helpful. Armani and Stephanie always make my day!  I've never been anywhere else where every employee is happy and friendly everyday! You're definitely doing something right Lahrona! :)

My review goes out to the service department. I dropped by yesterday to get an oil change on my car, although I didn't have an appointment they were able to accommodate me. As I pulled into the service area, three employees walked by my car without acknowledging me at all.  Jason walked by and immediately greeted me.  He assisted me with buying a package for oil changes and explained everything on my inspection.  He was super friendly, professional and definitely the reason I purchased the package to return back to get my car serviced at the dealership.  Thanks Jason!

A few words to easily describe the experience I had. dirty store, extremely cluttered and unfriendly, unhelpful staff.   Go to Max Muscle.

Came here for a birthday, food was good. Service could have been a little better! Our server looked a little like he was being tortured the whole time. Being in the industry as well, I know that a little personality goes a long way with your meal and often makes up for any shortcomings with the service. I'd go again and ask for Raul next time!

The service here is terrible. Even worse when it's slow. Two stars for country music but everytime I come here I sit at an almost empty bar with no one to greet me for at least 10 mins. Being in the service industry myself, this is unacceptable.

I almost went to chipotle but this place is right next to my bank that I was also visiting so I figured I'd try it. I'm impressed and not easily so. Employees were super nice, helpful and really friendly. The restaurant looks immaculately clean and my salad tastes great! (Try the pork!) Yum!  I'll be back!
