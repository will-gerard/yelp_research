I always love this place.  So much to see.  I learn something new every visit.  I like to bring my visiting friends here to expose them.    Today we went late enough that they didn't charge us for entry.  I don't know if that's a regular practice but pretty cool.    The listening stations & activities were fun.  I went to this museum for the first time maybe 12 years ago & it's amazing to see how it has grown.  I'm curious who goes there to buy $40,000 jewelry though.  Wow!

Just grabbed an epic burrito.  This thing should come with a warning... I honestly could not finish this thing.  It was so delicious!  I think it was less than 4 bucks.  I'd know for sure but we weren't given a receipt.  The guy at the drive through was very pleasant & quick.    So stuff!

They were not very friendly, my toe nails are already looking ragged.  I've never had my nails left this long before. One lady asked another worker to help us: she sat there, rolled her eyes, turned up her nose & refused to help us.  She sat there watching tv.  I didn't know a nail shop could look so ghetto I only stayed because I was in a hurry.    Oh did i mention I didn't even get the nail color I wanted?  I will never go back here & I'll warn my friends not to.  2007 is about the last time this place looked good.

Can someone please tell me why Tammy took liberties with my child's hair?  I said a trim not to hack it & shape it without asking first.  She has curly hair that used to be allb one length.  She went crazy with the clippers to the ends.  My daughter's hair isn't what we wanted & we left with frizzy hair.

How many a Best Buy stores do I have to be ignored at?  Where the hell is customer service.  We walked around looking for help in the refrigerator section & a little beyond & for no help.  After helping ourselves & using Google to get facts on different products, we left without a single person coming to our aid.  We were there a while maybe twenty minutes.    As we were exiting i mentioned lack of service & the gentleman at the door offered to get someone for us.  We declined & bought elsewhere.

Haven't eaten here in years.  Their food is mediocre but they deliver & we are hungry.  I ordered over an hour & a half ago.  I understand it is Saturday night but really.  Thank you for confirming that this place sucks on many levels.  Last time I ordered from this place (a few years back) there was plastic in my soup.  I thought it was a fluke but called to complain & they asked for proof.  This food better be good.  I doubt it.    Never again let hunger override better judgement.  It took 1 hour & 45 minutes to arrive at my house.  I will be calling tomorrow to complain.   Just as horrible as expected.  Every dish was barely above warm.  Bland & the chicken teriyaki was hard, dry & teriyucky!  Do not eat here!  Let them shrivel up, close & allow a good restaurant to open in it's place.

Greet me when i walk in.  I've been there twice recently and both times my greetings were lackluster.    My server at this past visit seemed very preoccupied and our table piled up with our old dirty dishes.  The server from my previous visit was very new at his job but his heart was in it and he used great common sense.  I loved him, just wish I could remember his name... older gentleman... possibly Mike.  Anyway, the restaurant is always pretty clean but this time I had dried food on my fork.  yuck!    The food was good,  The calamari was great as always... never a let down there.  The fried asparagus was a great idea but not executed as well as it could have been.    I really enjoyed the Zuppa Toscano (sp?)  The salad needed more olives but other than that I was please and will return to this location in the future.    Btw the manager check on our table both time I visited recently.  I like that, I feel like they actually care about my experience when they do that.

Extremely nice staff!  But not nice enough to make up for the subpar service & mediocre food.  Cats, did I mention freaking stray cats?  As someone allergic cats I was immediately turned off.  Ok, let's break down this visit.  Waitress was very nice, a little "green," but a complete sweetheart who seemed to try her best.  My warm water was never delivered, my daughter's drink was never refilled & she never offered condiments with my daughter's leftovers.  I feel bad for critiquing her because she was so nice but she has more to learn.  On a good note, they prebussed well.  I ordered a chips & salsa tree.  Three out of the four were good but the guacamole/tomatillo salsa was missing something.  I thought there green salsa tasted store bought.  The chips weren't too salty & were nice & crispy.  At this point, I'm pretty excited to try my shrimp & carne asada.  I'm thinking it's going to be amazing & I'll finally get to try elote.  (I was definitely curious about my husband's shrimp verdes enchiladas)  Food comes & that's about the best thing I can say about it.  I looked at my corn & it was clearly drying out from sitting around a while.  There was a weird stabbed key lime on the plate as well, also dry.  The shrimp, all three of them were eh but cooked appropriately (all 3 of them).  The beans were pretty good but nothing that really stood out to me.  Ok the best letdown was the carne asada.  It was a thick slab of meat not thinner slices, which is more traditional.  I ordered it medium rare & it was delivered slightly overcooked.  I was pleased with the tenderness of the meat but the flavor just tasted burned.  I called it charburned instead of charbroiled.  I asked for tortillas for my carne & she brought me three dried out tortillas that sat wrapped up so long they broke apart as i unrolled them.  I asked for more & they weren't much better.  I tasted one bite of my husband's enchiladas & was disappointed to taste that it was covered with that horrible store bought tasting green salsa.  I did not return for another bite.   I had high hopes for this place.  :/  P.S. my tourist friends loved it.  Perhaps they just didn't know better.

Love the staff, great ambience, food & beer.  Our waiter was great & very understanding when I had him take my pibil tacos back.  It was disgusting!  I copied my friend & had an Acapulco steak sandwich.  That was amazing!  So was the artichoke dip.  Their chips were thick and fresh.    I'll totally back there again.  I felt a little guilty cheating on my favorite ale house but this place was so great I got over it really quickly.    Moral of the story: go :)  P.S. my friend said not to recommend their Negril (sp?) drink.  It was crap gin & grapefruit maybe...yuck

Family trip to this location was pleasant & quick for most.  My husband & daughter got washed & trimmed.  I only got a wash.  My wash was relaxing & I loved the product she used on me.  I do not allow anyone that works at this location to do more than wash.  I do Not trust them with my African American hair type. The lady who trimmed my daughter's hair complained to her about it being so thick & kind of knotty.  She's only ten & biracial.  She likes to play, I'm sure after a long day at school her long thick hair might bee knotted.  Do not complain about it repeatedly to a child!    My husband liked his stylist who was the same that washed my hair.  She did a good job & has friendly.  I will not allow the middle aged blonde woman do any of our hair ever again.    (I'll have to check the receipt for names)

I love that I can order honey mustard bc Cane's sauce is overrated.    The chicken is amazing though.  I am not a fan of chicken fingers usually but when I'm in this area I'm always happy to stop in.  Juicy, fresh chicken with delicious coleslaw, toast & fries this place is great.

I love having a locally owned coffee shop so close to my place.  I like this place so much I am a regular and I've told countless friends to come here as well.  I don't support them just because they are local.  I support the because the coffee is top notch (and that's from a mostly non coffee drinking person), the staff is friendly and most of them will remember your order once you've been a couple of times.    I've held meetings here and my friends with kids don't feel as if they aren't welcome.  They have toys for them to play with and a menu that the little ones enjoy as much as adults.  The blended mocha is my favorite but I also enjoy their Italian sodas!  Other notables on the menu would be the chicken wraps, coffee cake (yummy!!!! messy crumbly goodness), I haven't had it yet but my friend is addicted to the lemon bars which is a seasonal item.  They have breakfast bagels and cookies too (I am a creature of habit so I usually just get a wrap and blended mocha.  Did I mention they also have gluten free items?  Yes!  Cookies and they will make wraps into salads for you.  There are seats outside and a drive thru (which I never use bc I prefer sitting in for a while) The shop and bathroom are always clean.  There are always crafts, flyers, business cards here for people to pick up and support local businesses around town.    Things I would change about this location:   soup!  I want soup!  fresh fruit and I want big fat soft cushiony chairs!!!!  All in all this is the place for me. :)

Once again this place has made me happy.  I wish they were closer.  The tractor pizza is so amazing.

Service is slow but the waitresses are always friendly.  Tonight service was better.  I only had one drink, it was fair price.  My friend kept raving about how great beer drink was.  Our waitress was training another girl.  That trainee is going to make a lot of money bc she was so sweet.  Just loved her personality.  I didn't eat tonight but I do enjoy the food.  Especially the philly sandwich.  I recommend this place for food & decent beer selection.

My friend works at a local coffee shop and almost everyday he walks down to Rito's for a burrito.  One day I saw him have a delicious looking green chile enchilada.  I just had to try it.  Well, that was three weeks ago and I've been there at least once a week since then.    The owner Richie greets you and instantly shows you a smaller menu so you don't have strain your neck to look up at the board.  Then he will ask ya where you are from and what your name is.  He's very nice!  Even makes conversation with my little one.  I was surprised when I returned he remembered my name.  :)  I order pretty much the same thing every visit.  I love the green chile enchilada with a side of rice and also chips with hot sauce.  Today I skipped out on the rice, my bill was less than $6 and I was full after.  LOVE THAT!    The dining room is always clean, a bit small but they cater more to "to-go" crowds.  They also ask for patience because they are not a fast food restaurant.  They hand out paper menus and encourage you to order ahead.    Only drawbacks to this location would be ours and days of operation.  They are closed on Sunday and Monday and they close at 6.   I'd give anything for them to be open until 7.   I wish their chips had less salt on them but that's only because I am not a big salt fan.  I still eat the heck out of the chips and sauce though.  ha ha ha  Word of warning.  THE BURRITOS ARE HUGE!  Thank goodness everything comes in a togo container. :)

Just have to add that I'm addicted to their taco salad.  I've even got my friends hooked.  Try it.  You won't be sorry!  Their green sauce & generous serving of meat is mouth pleasing & did I mention addictive?

Believe it or not 4 stars.  This was probably my fourth visit here & least enjoyable.  Since all the other visits were so great, I graded higher.  Tiny lil place made of shipping containers.  My complaint today was overly chewy chips.  Also, the chips were caked with salt.  They tasted stale & I was given diet coke.  I didn't notice until almost home.  Ok the part where I can be positive.  Fresh food & friendly staff.  I love the verde & brushfire salsa.  Yesterday I tried the potato croquets & they were pretty good.  Hot as hell so I know they're fresh.  Then my shrimp taco was yummy as well.  Shrimp was spicier that expected but I still loved out.  In the past I've tried the beans, friend shrimp & potatoes.  None of them let me down.  They were all fresh cooked & really delicious.    I love this "sit down" restaurant quality from this cute little drive thru place with only outside seating.

Stranded in Vegas with a broken car.  These guys did great work & called all over to find my part for a good price.  My mechanic at home told me to expect to pay about $1300-1400 dollars for this repairl.  My price with them was $1354.  So I don't feel like I was overcharged.  I also like that their work has a warranty.  Scott was a great guy.

The parking lot was fairly clean abd maintained landscaping.  The bathroom and dining room we're clean and the decor was standard Cane's cheerful bright & welcoming.  I love that they still greet everyone upon entry.   Our order came out quickly.  The chicken was piping hot but the fries not so much.  I went to ask for their complimentary honey mustard because Cane sauce is good but really not that big of a deal IMO.  While at the counter I mention to the manager that my fries were not that hot.  She said ok but never offered me a replacement.  I was starving so I just walked away.   My opinion on the chicken.  It is very delicious, juicy and consistent in preparation.  I am not a huge fan of chicken fingers so the fact that we drove out of our way means there are worth the drive.  This location has faulty locking mechanisms on The bathroom stalls make for awkward moments.  I accidentally walked in on someone and the other stall would not lock at all.  Would I return, yes.  Hope my fries are hot.  lol

Citran something or other.... Holy Hell delicious!  Great selection for beer.  This was our third stop for the night so we only had beer & dessert.  I only tried the smores fondue & brownie.  The fondue was great!    All in all service, selection & desserts were amazing.  My friends & I will be back.    They pre bus, they're friendly & good at their job.  Gotta love it.  Wish i lived closer.  Oh & their host was so cute & thoughtful.  Next time I want mussels.

Today was a free meal for us provided as an apology from the manager.  About three weeks ago we were on this side of town seeking emergency food.  A long day and it was after my 9 year old's bedtime.  Probably about 9 o'clock.  The service was so horrible I parked my car and walked in to complain.  Instead of offering to make things right I was met with a blank stare.  I basically cussed as I walked out with the wrong order bc it was about 9:20 and my poor kid need to get to sleep so I let her eat the nuggets as we drove home.  Ok so let's move beyond the horrible visit of the past and talk about this visit.  I was ignored by the only person at the counter when I walked in.  The next guy acknowledged us as he was zooming off to the back of the kitchen area.  They were pleasant, not pleased about giving me free food and had to go "check" with someone in back.  I actually didn't call to complain so I'd get free food.  I called and complained because if they keep acting that way some hot tempered diner is gonna get belligerent in here.  (like in that one YouTube video lol)  They need to change their ways and actually practice better customer service skills.  I smiled cracked jokes and treated them all very nicely the entire time I was there, I even offered to pay a different in what we ordered and what they were told we were supposed to be given.  They turned it down but seemed to feel better about themselves since I offered to pay.  I'm not poor, I can pay for my food dang it!.  Anyway, food.  Fries and fish were piping hot.  Anything else was heat lamp temperature but still edible.  I am from Louisiana and I've seen a Popeye's funnel thousands of people through in a short amount of time.  I know things can be better than what I've seen at this location lately.    Will I come here again?  Probably, if I am desperate and they are open. Really?  I honestly don't seem myself visiting this particular location anytime in the next year.  I just don't have the time for slow service and mediocre food.    The appearance of the store was mediocre.  Not dirty but definitely not clean.  Crumbs on almost every table and super slow service considering we were one of two customers ordering (drive thru and dining room).    If i am being completely honest, the visit was kind of depressing.  I remember when Popeye's was a special occasion in my family because we were very poor and didn't go out much to eat.  It always reminds me of my mom, brother and I enjoying chicken that was too hot to even touch but we couldn't help try to eat it before it was cool.    This Popeye's reminds me of a stripper working far past her prime.  Someone give this chick some clothes and teach her a skill because clearly this ain't working anymore.

I am not a bourbon or gin fan.  Well it turns out, I just needed to have the right ones.   We even got to sample their Four Peaks collaboration called Humphreys.  Amazing! I could honestly see myself drinking their gin with only ice bc it doesn't need a chaser.  The facility needs better signage, the tour was short but I was thoroughly entertained.  These guys explain the process well & they really know their stuff.  I'll have to brin my husband back.  Support local business!  Yes! This one definitely.

The chefs were very nice.  Our waiter was friendly & knowledgeable.  I would have liked our area bussed more but that would have been my biggest complaint.  All in all no biggie.  That Red Bull roll should be tested for illegal substances bc that is addictive! Thank you for the great local sushi joint with service to match. My husband approved of the short skirts on the waitresses.  We didn't drink but I can imagine hanging out in their bar area with friends.  P.S. I feel the prices were reasonable as well.
