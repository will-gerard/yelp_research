Love love love this place.  Staff is friendly & helpful.  The food is great.  We just had my daughter's birthday party here.  The kids had a blast racing but really loved the bowling.  Outside seating area is great too.  Everything is very clean & top of the line.  You should go!

If you need junk yard parts this is the place to go. Everything is super organized and the staff is knowledgeable. We've used them for everything for our jeeps. Engines, leaf springs.. You name it they have it.

Every time I'm in this store & need to try something on the dressing rooms seem like they have no air conditioning.  Seriously?  We are in Arizona.  We are in the ladies department.  Ladies need to be cool to try on endless outfits to try to find one stupid thing that fits.  Macy's please turn the air down!  When I said something to an employee she said it's always hot & that I should find a supervisor & say something to them.  Give me a break.

I took my son to Grads this morning for his senior year book picture.  It was very easy to make an appoimtment.  The studio is very nice.  They have the fake tuxedo for the kids to borrow.  They have a huge room with tons of backgrounds for your regular senior pictures.  The photographer took 6 shots & let us look on the computer to pick out the best one.

The kids love this place for birthday parties.  The biggest problem I've noticed is that there is nothing for adults to do while you are waiting for the kids to play their game.  You only have the party room for a designated time.  There isn't very much seating for adults to hang out & chat (if they aren't playing) while the kids are gaming.  Most times my kids grandparents come to their birthday parties even though they aren't going to play.

Oh man!  What a donut.  This was my first time visiting here and I was impressed.   Seriously can not believe how good they were.  The place was a little divey & old but the selection made up for it by far.  We ordered two dozen.  One we ate at the shop & one to take home to the guys.  Loved it.

Went to Big Surf yesterday using a Groupon for my family of 6.  It was a great day.  I am a huge fan of this water park.  Even though it is an older water park it is very clean & the teenage workers are unusually friendly compared to the other 2 water parks in the valley.

I love thrift stores! This was my first visit to Deseret Industries.  It was very clean & well organized.   I like that the prices are thrift store prices & not outrageous.  They have a ton of vintage items & name brand clothes.  My husband got a shirt for $2!  I will shop here again when I'm on that side of town.

The only reason I'm giving them only 2 stars is that it took 20 mins. to go through the drive thru.  Seriously?  It made me late for an appointment.  I got the grilled chicken nuggets & they were amazing!  I love their food-just wish the drive thru could move a little faster.

This store can often be frustrating yet I always end up here when it's time for Halloween costumes for the kids. They seem to put the same used packaged up year after year. It's so stupid expensive for something that will only be worm for a couple of hours at most.

This is one of the best pedicure places I've been to.  They make it a point to speak English.  They also keep girls much longer than the average nail salon.  It is very very clean & they make sure to have the most recent colors.  Make sure you get a punch card when you go.  After so many services you will get $10 off.

It's a gym so what can I say?  I hate them.  I hate having to go there.  I think we should all by healthy & skinny always.  Reality says that for a gym this one rocks.  Super clean & the equipment is in great shape.  The locker rooms are clean too.  They have tanning, childcare, & a hair salon & chiropractor.  Shawn is sales is the best & you should talk to him if you need a membership.

This is an awesome thrift store.  They have tons of quality items & it is very organized.  If you go I suggest going on a discount day where you can get another 40percent off what you purchase.  The only thing I do not like is their return policy.  You only have 7 days & it has to be exchanged for another item at the same time.  Other stores like this will give you store credit to use whenever.

I have used this company off & on for about 5 years.  I've tried other companies in between because of scheduling conflicts.  This company is the best by far.  They make sure to spray the entire property & the weeds stay gone.  If by chance some do come back they guarantee the work & come spray again for free.

I've used Fast Med Urgent Care three times now.  It's a great office is you can't make a doctors appointment or have something that doesn't need an emergency room.  The office is sparkling clean.  The receptionist is informed & friendly.  The doctors seem to know their stuff.  My wait time has never been very long either.  They even have an online check in so you can get most of it done before going into the office.

Went to pick up a birthday cake for my daughter today.  Wow!  It was the best ice cream cake ever.  Great price for the largest cake $23.  The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star rating is because I wish this store had a full grill.  Hot dogs don't do it for me.  There is nothing like a hot off the grill Dairy Queen Cheeseburger.

If you need something for your home this is the place to go.  It is huge! I can't believe the selection. The prices are really good too. Plan on spending some time. They have a cafe so you can make a day of it. It's nice that the sales staff doesn't follow you around. They give you space to figure out what you need without pressuring you.  It seems like a lot of the furniture has to be put together & delivery can be a little spendy.
