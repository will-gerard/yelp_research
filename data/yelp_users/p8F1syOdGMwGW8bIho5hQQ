IF THERE WAS A ZERO THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW!!!  This star used to be at the 5 mark especially due to their salads, BBQ, and French Dip!!!!  Here's the story!      To give a little background about myself it is that I am married to my husband who is 70 and I around the 40 mark.  We are opposites in sight....He is buttoned up shirt and shorts and I am full sleeved tattoos and am more of a t-shirt kinda guy (The t-shirt in question is a cartoonish glow in the dark skeletal outline)  Don't get me wrong I do dress up well when the occasion calls for it.      On July 26, 2015 at approximately 1 p.m., my spouse and I had run errands, met with people and went home, showered and put on our CLEAN weekend work clothes.  We decided we wanted a good salad and the first place that popped into my head was Hillstone.  We get to the entrance door which was propped open by I am assuming the last patrons who had exited the building.  We walk in and close the door behind us.  We are greeted by a sweet smiling you woman all in black and asks how many; we say "Two please".  She says "Right this way".  We follow her up a slightly slanted ramp to a dead end and take a right to a standard table for four.  She places down the menus on the table and my spouse begins to sit.  As I pick my chair which was the one where my back would face the window and begin to pull it out to sit, the lady in black says "Do you have a different shirt with you?"  OKAY this pissed me off!  I turned around and shooed my hands towards the table in a "whatever" type of motion and walked out mumbling things I don't wish to repeat past 3 occupied tables, pushing the door open and realizing how embarrassing that was.  I understand if there is a dress policy (Which we did not see anywhere and later are told it apparently is on one of the doors as we entered, perhaps the one we had to pull shut.  If we were told I had "inappropriate" attire on when we walked in the door at the beginning I would not be so disappointed, hurt and embarrassed. On Yelp it states that the dress is "Casual" which could mean many a thing.  I am sure professional musicians who have stepped in the doors of this establishment have not even been questioned about the dress code.      I felt I was misrepresented as a client.  The worst thing you can do is make a person feel so inferior for the most trivial reasons and think it can just be categorized under an "oops" moment.  I am not one to play the "gay" card; however, I do feel that tattoos and the appearance of someone based on their tattoos is a different card altogether.....No!  It is a different GAME altogether!  I usually let things slide off and carry on with my day, but this was humiliating.  I don't care what people think of me, but I sure as hell do care about other people like me who have the same type of situations happen to them.    For being overpriced the food WAS wonderful!  I would take clients as well as family, friends and my attorney here to eat on occasion.  I think its time to look around for less judgmental companies to accept my hard earned money.

They just revamped the interior and it appears they can now fit more people in.  We always go in or lunch and getting a 4 spice is just fine for my above average gringo tongue.  Food is continually good... Service is always around... Owners always make you feel like family.  I can't just suggest one meal for all have been stellar.

I love this place when the loud and obnoxious suits and polos drinking martinis decide to be silent.  Great service from Corbin for he likes to be himself.  He is not robot but very professional.  Ask for him when you visit.  Love the food and sin on the lower calorie desserts.

The food has been solid the las 10 or so times we have come in for lunch as well as dinner.  They had some kitchen issues in the past and for a while we stopped going in.  A couple familiar faces as servers are still here.  Jon always takes good care of his people.  Drinks are solid and delicious.  I had the trout for the first time and it sure won't be the last.  Contrary to rumors in the papers and on the news the Z is doing just fine and media needs to get full story and records straight.  Come on in and enjoy the food....the people... And just sit back and chill
