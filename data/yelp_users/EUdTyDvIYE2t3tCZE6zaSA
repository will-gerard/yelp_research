What an incredibly beautiful place this was to have our Mother's Day brunch.  Melissa (my sister-in-law), if you are reading this, this idea was amazing!  I vote we go here again next year...thought I'm sure I will be back before then.  We drove up Mother's Day, saw all the cars, and immediately thought, "well, this is gonna be a crowded mess".  We were wrong.  Parking was valet which was nice, but we walked over to The Farm and were astonished.  It didn't even feel like Phoenix.  It felt like going somewhere green and lush...where real weather occurs and the plants are not all equipped with poison and/or spines.  I can only attest to Mother's Day so far, but it was amazing.  The food was delicious; tomato salad with mozzarella and basil, fruit salad with mint, asparagus and mushroom quiche, french toast with candied pecans, bananas and a carmel drizzle, "mom"-lettes...all of it was delicious.  There were dads playing catch with their children, beautiful pathways through the plants growing, a tractor for the children to play on...and there were plenty of umbrellas to keep the shade up and the heat down.  We found out that they serve box lunches, and I absolutely intend to be back to try their menu and to spend my day in their fields, under their trees, walking through their gardens.

Being from Tucson, I naturally think Brooklyn's is the best New York style pizza.  I went along with my boyfriend to Buono's on a recent trip to Phoenix, and watched them create pizza after delicious-looking pizza starting with what is clearly home-made pizza dough.  They then coat it in a sauce the likes of which I have never seen on a pizza before.  It was thin, and I expected a watery taste, but it was anything but.  The crust was out of this world.  It is thin and chewy and flavorful.  The sauce was bursting with flavors of tomatoes and garlic, and the mozzarella was thick but not overpowering to the other flavors.    I only had the cheese pizza here, his reasoning being that to truly judge a pizza place, you need to evaluate their cheese pizza.  I can't wait for the next trip to Phoenix to try another offering!

I came in with a group of friends on our way back to Tucson after spending the night in Phoenix.  We went in to get a table and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait.  After 45 minutes of just waiting around for our table to be ready, we went up to the hostess stand to ask what the hold up was.  The hostess told us that she had called our name and we didn't show up so they thought we "surrendered our reservation."  We were standing there the whole time, with a group of us, and not one person in our group heard them call out our name.  We finally got to sit, and noticed that the servers all have stars on their name tags, ranging in number.  We asked our server what the stars mean (he had two), and he told us it was their customer service scores.  Uh oh!  I ordered french toast, and they asked if I wanted a fruit topping, and I ordered apples.  They then asked if we wanted syrup, and I said yes to that as well.  My french toast comes out with no syrup and no apples.  I had to flag down my server to ask for these things, and even then I only got the apples.  Then, the gross happened.  We were seated right next to the main entrance, and this little kid came running up and vomited right behind us (In this kids defense, he really was trying to haul ass to the bathroom and just didn't quite make it).  Now, this vomit was not chunky, it was clear (I'm getting to why this is important).  The employees took SO long to clean it up that people ended up walking through it, since it wasn't immediately noticeable to the unsuspecting pedestrian, and tracked vomit throughout this eatery.  They never even offered to move us, so we got to sit, horrified, watching this all go down.  Next time we have a night on the town in Phoenix, we will skip right over Cracker Barrel in it's vomity gloriousness and head straight to IHOP.

I just...I find this place to be very unfair.  Why is it in Phoenix when I live in Tucson?  Why does it have way better hummus, chicken schwarma, gyros and babaganoush than anywhere I can find in Tucson?  Why do they have better home-made feta cheese than anywhere in Tucson?  Why, Haji-Baba?  Why?  I want answers!  I really love hole-in-the-wall places.  This place is no exception.  Their hummus was described to me as "creamy" and I made a vomit noise.  But it is totally creamy.  But not with dairy, it's like they put it through a mill or something, because a food processor could never in a million years make it that smooth.  The babaganoush was tangy and flavorful, served with freaking amazing pita bread that was warm.  The chicken schwarma was...I don't know that words can describe it.  Basically anything I say will make is sound not as good as it was.  Divine doesn't cut it.  Juicy, perfectly cooked, exploding with flavor...I mean...they work for now.  I will make up a word soon that adequately describes it.  The gyro was spectacular.  The meat was seasoned to tender perfection, and they put home made feta cheese on it!  The feta cheese is not nearly as salty as any other kind I have ever had, and it was way creamier.  We had rose-water lemonade, which I have indeed found in Tucson.  At the street fair.  You know, the one that happens twice a year?  I am pretty happy to find a place that has it year-round!

The Hotel:3/5  We had to come here for a business trip this week, and since the company was paying, we tried to find a very inexpensive hotel to stay in.  We found this place for $25 for two nights and the third night free.  I must say, I was expecting a teeny, tiny, weensy disgusting room.  This was way bigger than I expected, and pretty clean.  The pillow cases had some stains, and there was not a single even surface in the bathroom (my toothbrush fell off the counter and onto the floor...), but it was just what a room needed to be.  The mattress...well...I understand some people like them firm and such, but I woke up every day stiff and sore.  The location was AWESOME!  It was stumbling distance from an awesome bar call Insert Coins, that giant Fremont TV thing, and a zillion casinos and restaurants.  I loved how close it was to lots and lots of entertainment.    However.  When I was checking out, they said I had a $22 long-distance call made from my room.  I made absolutely no calls except to room service, and it turned out one of the maids made a long distance call from my room while she was in there and charged it to my account.  They were nice about taking that off, but I am glad I went to the counter to check out.  The Casino: 4/5  This casino was pretty inexpensive.  I know it sounds silly, but the table minimums were great, you could actually play pennies in the penny machines (which I won three jackpots on...yeah, that's right!  I am the Wolf Run slot machine goddess!), the cocktail waitresses were attentive, if not super chatty, and they didn't skimp on the alcohol in the free drinks.  If I ever were to return to Vegas (probably never again on my own free will), I would love to stay here again.

I'm not from the area and I was in Vegas on sort of a mini trip for a couple of days.  Just when I got in to city limits, the tire pressure light went off in my car.  I brushed it off as just a product or being on the freeway for 7 hours, and thought it was nothing to worry about.  Then, when I got my car back from the valet while I was all packed up and ready to go, we saw that my tire was nearly flat.  I frantically looked on Yelp for a place to refill my tire or, if possible, patch it for as inexpensively as possible.  This was the closest location, and we pulled up and asked if they could fill the tires for us.  They let us know that if the tire was patchable, they would do it for free.  All of the staff here were really friendly and very helpful.  They didn't charge us anything for our patch job, and got it done super quickly.  In less than half the time I was expecting.  Though I will probably never be here again, I would totally recommend going here for the friendly staff and expedient service.

I came here after going to another bar for dinner.  It was so much fun!  They had this band that was playing great songs (Sweet Caroline was the first one they played when I got in there...THAT is fun to sing with a giant beer glass in hand...swinging it above your head).  They had a two story horn, similar to the Ricolla commercials, that they blew after hoisting it toward the ceiling.  There is a woman that walks around with test tubes and a bottle of Jaeger.  Should you buy a shot from this well-muscled woman, she makes you stand, with your hands on the end of the table, whilst she paddles you.  She does not hold back.  Apparently, in my highly inebriated state, I did not think she was hitting me hard enough, and asked her to paddle me and hard as she did the boys.  MAN did that sucker hurt!  SO much fun, though!  Also in my highly inebriated state, I convinced myself that I am fully bilingual and talked to a German man in, what I thought was, perfect Spanish.  Also, while swinging my giant beer mug where I thought was over my head, I smacked it into my tooth and it chipped.  I didn't fully remember this until the next morning when I found the chip.  This is besides the point, but pretty amusing to my bar-mates and I.    The food...I had some kind of cheese vegetarian thing.  I can't remember even vaguely was it was called, but it was so, so delicious, with shoe string onions on it!  Everyone in my party really liked their food.

I recently had to go to Las Vegas for a business trip and thought we would try to see some of the sights.  We thought the Pink Pony was still around and Richard was all excited to eat there again.  We were sad to find it was no longer in business, but we were starving and decided on the buffet.  This was awful.  Most of the food was completely inedible.  It looked and tasted like it had been out for hours.  It was all greasy and dried completely out.  Richard had prime rib, which was incredibly over cooked and extremely tough.  The best part was honestly the chocolate milk.  Even the cranberry juice delivered from an outside source had a weird, not-quite-right taste about it.    I forgot my computer on this trip, or else I would have yelped and saved myself about $35 on horrible, bland greasy "food".

I would like to preface this review with this: I had no desire whatsoever to eat British food when I came here.  I was forced.  I was told it was amazing, and Yelp reviews have very rarely steered me wrong.  I walked in and loved the decor and set up!  It was very comfortable and I did feel like I was in a British pub.  Not that I have been to Britain.  But I can imagine.  I really like that they carry Quorn products.  I recently became aware of this meat-alternative and have gone a little nuts over it.  It tastes and has the same texture as real chicken.  Anyway, I digest.  I had the Quorn Chicken Pesto Pasty.  Oh my gosh, it was so good!  I was not a fan of the sauce it came with, and the service was pretty slow, which is why it got four instead of five.  The person I went with had....I don't know, but it was beefy and came with the best wine sauce ever.

I need to update my review of this place badly.  I LOVE Cornish Pasty Company!  My only complaint is that there isn't one in Tucson yet.  YET!  A girl can dream.... but for right now I have to be happy that my husband will bring me one every time he goes to Phoenix to see his family, that I get them anytime I am in Phoenix, and that on my way to and from Pine, I can have a pasty.  I still love the decor, and the vibe this place gives off.  Punk rock music, candles in liquor bottles, large, wooden tables that sometimes need to be shared with other groups.  The service CAN be a little slow at times, but I attribute this to the fact that they have to bake your pasty when you order it, which is not the quickest thing ever.  I know exactly how long it takes, because when my husband brings them home, he asks to get them raw so we can bake them in our own oven.  They have vegetarian and even vegan pastys on top of their delicious meat-filled variety.  I have gotten a tremendous variety of pastys and I have yet to have one that i didn't care for.  I usually go for something vegetarian, but I DID have the Sheppard's Pie one last time and it was amazing.    Cornish Pasty also has a large beer selection along with some ciders which is just delightful.  The servers know what beer I may want and always have helpful suggestions.  I am a big, big fan of Cornish Pasty Company.  It's always fresh and delicious, decent service, fun atmosphere and all at a good price.

Holy mother of drunken Mario Kart 64 playing!  This place is amazing!  Jason, our bartender, was funny, great to chat with, and bought us a couple shots while we played N64 (yes, I know they have WAY newer consoles, but I only know how to play N64).  The drinks were a little pricey, but not watered down in anyway.  We got pretty darned toasty in this bar.    We mainly had White Russians and Pucker Vodka shots, but Jason, good man that he is, split a shot for us of Three Olives Loopy, which tasted EXACTLY like Fruit Loops.    They have these cool booths to sit in while you play your games.  It is pretty trendy inside, and I was intimidated because I am a dive bar kind of girl.  But everyone in there was so friendly and sweet, and made me feel right at home.
