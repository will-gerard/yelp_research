My family's been coming to this place for years, and it used to be one of my favorite restaurants! Then we heard their head chef left a few years ago, and the quality wasn't as good anymore. Nevertheless, we were in the area last week and decided to try them out again. Came for dinner, and the place was pretty full! (Although, apparently the other restaurants in the plaza had closed down so it could just be due to lack of choice).   We ordered our usual dishes, and they were still pretty good! The only disappointment was the cold noodles: They were pretty flavorless, and completely different from before. But the Chongqing Chicken (Bone-In) was still crispy and flavorful! However, the portion was much smaller than in the past. Another favorite of ours is the stir-fried green pepper potato strips, which didn't disappoint. Overall a solid spot to go for some authentic Szechwan cuisine.

More authentic than places like Panda Express, but definitely not somewhere I'd go for quality Chinese food. I went with a big group and we ordered a variety of dishes off the menu. Overall their prices are low, but their food is rather one-dimensional. And they drench almost all of their dishes in thick sauces, making them feel greasy and unhealthy.  While the service is good and they have a lot of seating for large groups, the food is nothing more than something cheap and filling.

I've been coming to this little store since I was in elementary school for their shaved ice (and at a younger age, their candy selection). So I guess it's nostalgia that keeps me coming back. That, and the wall of flavored syrups you can marvel at before choosing 1-2 for your shaved ice. A bit of advice: just stick to one flavor. Though 2 flavors is nice at first, in the end they just mix together and all you can taste is sugar.

Have been looking for a good Korean restaurant in Phoenix, and this place definitely measures up! The prices are a little higher than expected, but it's a popular establishment and the staff are friendly!  I'm a huge fan of bibimbap, and I love that their hot pot bibimbap comes with Kalbi! Our table also shared a seafood pancake, and it was really yummy! A lil more shrimp than I would have liked (esp since they were of the frozen baby shrimp variety), but it was crisp and had a good consistency!  Didn't get a chance to try any of their bbq items, but their tofu soup lunch special looked good! Side dishes were okay. Good variety, but I was hoping for some fish cakes or cold noodles.

Came here for lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't too busy, unlike their weekday lunch rushes. We ordered the pad thai, pad see ew, and green curry lunch specials. The lunch specials are a really good deal, at only $8 for a large portion, salad, and egg roll! (The salad and egg roll weren't that impressive though)  I really liked the flavor of the pad thai (and that it came with peanuts!), but was disappointed because the pad see ew was really over-sauced. The green curry was good, but nothing special. So I would recommend the pad thai. The staff was also very friendly, and there's a 10% discount if you pay in cash!

Love their happy hour! I always come with a couple girlfriends, and we order a drink and a bunch of appetizers/sushi rolls to share. My favorites are the avocado egg rolls and calamari! Although I probably wouldn't come here for their regular menu since their prices are on the expensive side for the quality.  The patio can be a bit loud, but otherwise they have a good environment, and the service is great!

Tried their new Atlantic Haddock Sandwich, and it was delicious! The fish was well cooked and flavorful, and the bread was so light and fluffy! And it came with a tasty orzo salad I wish I could have gotten more of.   Also tried their soup (Chicken Basil Chili) and salad (Wildflower Salad) combo, and it was satisfying but not amazing. The salad has quite a bit of dressing, so I would suggest asking for the dressing on the side if possible. The bread that came with the soup and salad was yummy though! It's the bread of the month, and they also have samples in store, and it's available for purchase!

Got a new Chevy Cruze here and it was an awesome deal! Found an advertised deal online for an employee driven car (it was new but had some mileage on it). The actual car advertised wasn't available, but we were able to buy a similar model for the same price. It took a LOT of haggling (thanks to my mom's persistence), but we were finally able to buy my first car!

Consistently good pizza, but definitely not the best pizza I've had, not by a long shot. But the size of the slice, for the price, is a really good deal! And when you eat in, they give it to you on a platter, with a little personal pizza cutter to eat it with. The novelty of that never gets old.

I've been coming to this place since it opened, and I always plan a lunch/dinner here with friends when I'm back in town. The novelty of this place is that you get your sushi for a revolving conveyer belt! And they've spaced is so that it goes throughout the restaurant. Good for allowing people seated at booths to also access the belt, bad for if you want a certain type of sushi and need to wait for it to roll all the way around again...  I will say upfront that the quality is not the best. And over the years, I think the rolls have gotten smaller... And sometimes you don't know how long those rolls have been sitting out on the conveyer belt, waiting for someone to take them. On the plus side, the popular rolls are replenished quite frequently so those are always freshly made. You can even order from the chefs if there's something you want that's not on the belt.   And the prices can't be beat! From $1 for the cheapest, and $2 for the most expensive, the sushi comes on plates of 2-4 rolls. This is probably the best bang for your buck if you want to try a variety of different rolls. I always end up getting full on less than $10, which is pretty cheap for sushi!

Great place to hang out with friends and catch a game! The back has a lot of seating (tables and booths) and TVs at every angle so that they have multiple games playing at once! They have a pretty good happy hour from 3-7pm, with a variety of appetizers (every day) and assorted drinks (except Saturday).  Came with a group of friends to watch a football game, and we ordered an assortment of appetizers, 2 pitchers of Blue Moon, and a couple entrees to share. I got the buffalo fish sliders, because they seemed pretty unique. The plate came with 3, and although they were a little heavy on the mayo they were really tasty! Unfortunately, the curly fries I got on the side could have been crispier/more flavorful. Their steak fries didn't look too great either though. I would say their food is good, but not amazing.  Overall, we had a great experience! Our server was really friendly, and the environment was spacious and clean! Will definitely revisit when I'm back in town!

Came here for breakfast with a couple girl friends. This is such a cute place! A bright, open dining space with colorful (and slightly girly) decorations. I love the local environmentally-conscious vibe, and the staff are really friendly!  I ordered the In-Season Egg Scramble, which came with a delicious stir fry of fresh vegetables, and yummy multi-grain toast! I love their toast! Much more fun than the regular wheat toast at most breakfast places, with a yummy berry jam! My friends ordered the multi-grain toast with almond butter, which was beautifully plated (with pomegranate seed topping!) and looked delicious as well! (And is a good way to go if you don't want a large portion). The best part, nothing felt heavy/greasy!  They also have an assortment of baked goods and desserts, which looked delicious! And they have complimentary cucumber water, which was super refreshing! I'm excited to come back and try their juices as well!

A locally owned yogurt shop, with friendly staff and a wide range of flavors and toppings! I especially like the sour apple + dulce de leche twist that makes it taste like a caramel apple! They always seem to have a lot of fresh fruit toppings, and they have TOASTED coconut in addition to regular coconut! (Never seen that at any other yogurt store before)  The price per oz is more than the average yogurt store, but its variety and proximity to my house keeps me coming back for more!

Mediocre and overpriced Mongolian bbq. Came with a restaurant.com gift certificate, so the price wasn't too bad, but at a regular price of $10 a bowl, I could get more food for much better quality elsewhere. On the plus side, they have a pretty wide range of meats and flavors, and even offer recipe cards to help you compile your bowl. However, I didn't really like their selection of starches. They only had rice or udon noodles, but I really wanted something more like an egg noodle...  And though the service was friendly, the fact that they need waiters/waitresses simply to bring you drinks and your finished bowl seems rather unnecessary.

Great facility to play basketball/other court sports. It's relatively new, and it's never crowded. And for a $5 membership, you get unlimited access!   They also have badminton from 4-6pm on Saturdays!

I love the decor here! And major props for sourcing fresh and local ingredients! (So I don't mind paying the higher prices) I tried the breakfast burro crepe with chorizo, but the chorizo was dry and detracted from the rest of the crepe... But their sweet crepes (I tried the Pick me up and Vanilla bean) are definitely worth the hype! I especially like the coffee crepe - gives it great flavor without being overpowering. And while it gets pretty busy during the weekend brunch hours, the tables turn over relatively fast.

Arizona's first badminton gym! I go to college in California where there are tons of badminton gyms, so it's great that Phoenix (my hometown) finally has a gym of it's own! Now instead of a few set hours in community rec centers, badminton lovers can drop in and play any time of the day! They have monthly/annual membership options, or drop-in day rates.  My only gripe is that the facility is very small, and feels rather closed in. There are only 4 courts, and they are very close together. Of course funding a badminton gym is expensive, but I'm hoping once it becomes more established they can afford to expand!

It's located in a tiny plaza that's a little difficult to find, but I'm not complaining because it's the cheapest pho I've ever had! It's $5.50 for a regular sized bowl, and it comes with all the regular fixings! The portions are really big (especially for the XL size which is only $7) and the broth is tasty. Another reason I'm a fan: They have an option that only includes rare steak and tripe in your pho. (3D) Considering I'm a huge fan of tripe but not the other additional pho meats, it's the perfect option for me!  Also tried their spring rolls, which were $2.00 for an order of 2. Amazing how cheap it is, given that the quality is on par with what you would expect form a fancier establishment.  Overall, it's a no-frills restaurant that serves up good pho at extremely low prices!

Super cute coffee shop in downtown Chandler! They have modern, industrial decor, and also have their own coffee roaster. It's a great study/meeting space because they have a variety of tables and workspaces, and plenty of outlets along the window. They also have seasonal specials such as peppermint mocha and cocoa nib cold brew (which I tried). The cold brew was good, but the cocoa nib taste wasn't as distinct as I had hoped. I also sampled the chai, and it's delicious - more aromatic than most chai teas! The hot drinks are served in cute cups and the cold ones in mason jars!
