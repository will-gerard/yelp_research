Always a top notch dining experience. Nothing short of perfection. I recommend the burratta for an app. Ask for Eric For great service!

Unfortunately I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  The Doctor was great but dealing with the front desk staff is so difficult I left and went to another practice.  They don't  give phone messages, return phone calls, spell your name right on documents so your prescriptions aren't right... 3 strikes and you're out!  Bummer.

Got food poisoning from the oysters and sent them an email about it and they never even responded. For the prices they charge they should treat their patrons better than that.

Unimpressed.  Love the concept but for the price everything should be organic.  We spent almost $30 for 2 people without drinks. They forgot my cheese in the salad. The pears weren't ripe and the experience was just meh.  Bummer.

I wanted to like this place so badly! It was adorable but that's where it ended. It took a while to get our drinks and the waitress came to take our food order before the drinks even came out. It took an hour to get our food and then the food order was wrong. They said the reason the food took so long was because they had an issue thawing out the fish. Lovely! Then they brought out a pizza instead of the ribs (pizza was good) but the wrong order. Then it took about 20 minutes for them to split the bill down the middle on 2 cards. They blamed everything on glitches so maybe I'd try again in a few months when the glitches are worked out but you only have 1 chance to make a first impression. So disappointing:-(

This review is in regards to catering from Chestnut. We had Chestnut cater a bat mitzvah brunch this past weekend. We priced out a few restaurants and while price wise Chestnut was in line with the other restaurants, what we received with Chestnut far exceeded our expectations. Chestnut brought all the food in beautiful presentation ready serve ware and delivered it and set up all the food and picked it all up when the brunch was complete. The food was delicious and everyone ranted and raved about how delicious it was. The maple scone was the best thing I've eaten all year. Kirsten worked with us to get the best spread for all the dietary requirements as we had vegetarians, gluten free, and kosher. I will definitely use chestnut again for our catering needs.

Chestnut hosted an event for my niece this past weekend and I can't rave enough about the level of service provided. Additionally our guests ranted about the food particularly the fried Brussels sprouts and the crispy chicken.   Kirsten once again was a saint and worked with all the dietary requirements of our guests. I would recommend chestnut for catering without hesitTion and will continue to use them for catering needs.
