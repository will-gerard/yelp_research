Traders switched me out with an even better product after my initial product stopped working. Thanks for the upgrade and excellent service. I will definitely keep Traders as my go-to for smoke shop needs.

Bottled used to be one or my favorite spots to go out with ALL my friends in Scottsdale (Days and nights--every weekend!). The bouncer said that I was no longer ever allowed in because I was too intoxicated the weekend prior AND tried to knock his cell phone out of his hand. I was greeted with hostility and disrespect for actions I never did.   Needless to say, I do not think the bouncers should have a final say on whether or not I'm not allowed in and spend money with you guys.  Unless this matter is resolved, Bottled Blondes will be missing our business, not just mine. No more tables, no more invites from out of state guest, no more good clean fun in an establishment I stood by for the last 7 years. I would like nothing more than to get this resolved in an ethical and professional manner. Feel free to contact me so we can get this fixed the right way.
