I moved a few months ago and was looking for a groomer in the neighborhood.  I went on YELP and found a great first time deal for Puff n Fluff who were just down the street. I have a Brussels Griffon and it is hard to find a groomer that understands just how to do a Brussels cut and actually listens when I say I want her body short but her beard long! I also had a dog I had just rescued who was very shaggy and needed a shave badly! I brought both dogs in for a clean up. Just a few short hours later I got a call from Melissa saying everyone was ready- I was surprised how they had squeezed me in on short notice and also got done so quickly! Not only was I given a first time client discount on my Brussels, but they also gave me a very nice discount on the dog I found.  I was not expecting that. I knew at that moment I would start bringing all 5 of my dogs to PnF! The next day I even got a text message asking how our experience was and thanking me for my business. I think the customer service at PnF blew me away, not to mention the awesome job they did on the haircuts. The owner, Liz is always around and you can tell she really cares about her business and her clients. PnF might be small but they are MIGHTY! They truly care about your pups as if they were their own and they care about their customers too. I have found my FUREVER groomer! WOOF!!!

So I have been wanting to come to this joint for EVA! How-EVA, our experience was not fabulous. It was more like DRAB-ulous. Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night. The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up, so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav!)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink. The server did not offer to bring me something different, he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that. Hmmmm. There were a MILLION specials. It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list. It was baffling. The prices are NOT cheap. We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour. Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters. Well, they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood, but definitely not pork! All the server said was "Well it listed the chorizo on the menu"- Hmmmmmm. Again, we just kept them. Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand! At this point, we had already ordered the mushroom toast points, but after the oyster debacle, we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came, it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms, totally overcooked and unappetizing. We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to "do anything" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth). Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer. I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check, however, there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server, let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp.  Again, I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant, but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night, you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future. Well that didn't happen, perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares, we are well known so whatever. Well, whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts, plus now I have written a poor review, and all my FB friends know about it too. I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated. We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again. Such a shame. Customer service is dead these days... SIgh....Hope it was worth the $30 bucks guys.

I used to go to the very first Brando's on Blue Diamond Road almost 10 years ago. I've also been to the restaurant on Sunset/ Green Valley. On a recent trip back to Las Vegas I visited Brando's and WOW is it ever better than I remember! The atmosphere is always inviting, definitely a local feel but such a great change from the madness of restaurants on the Strip. The staff always welcomes you and makes you feel right at home. I chose Brando's to watch some NFL playoff games and they have so many TV's and the sound is LOUD which I love. I'd totally watch the Superbowl there. The best part is their PIZZA. Chicago style, they even have authentic deep dish. Fresh toppings and REAL mushrooms, not those fake one's most places use. Also the best Philly Cheese steak sandwich!  My drink was never empty and the beer was ice cold!  If you use the gaming machines, you drink for free too. I LOVE this place. WAY better than any chain joint I've found in Vegas. A must see!

I have been running a non-profit Dog Rescue in Phoenix for several years.  I have worked with many local vets as well.  Every interaction I have had with Diamondback has been exceptional.  Their staff is always eager to help in any way and they never keep any of my dogs in need waiting.    I've also had to treat 2 of my personal dogs, one with Hemolytic Anemia and the other with severe arthritis and my medicines were so much cheaper here.  Most recently, one of the amazing staff members actually paid out of their own pocket and personally donated a drug we desperately needed to treat a very serious condition for a dog we rescued from the streets and would have died without.    I really think people need to understand that dealing with sick pets is stressful in and of itself- let's try not to take it out on the service providers and pharmacies who are here to help.  Diamondback will ALWAYS have my continued, loyal business.

This is my new favorite restaurant. What an incredible menu and such a kind place to eat. Options for veg/an and human kind in general. We are all gentler souls for having visited this brilliant establishment. Kudos to mother and daughter dream team. SO worth the drive to Ahwatukee.

Support your local coffee shop- Buck the Bucks! The coffee here is roasted right on premise and tastes delicious! The atmosphere is welcoming and comfortable- the perfect place to work, have a business lunch or a great cuppa joe! The baristas are friendly and each cup of coffee is hand made with TLC. They really go to great lengths at Echo to provide an outstanding product. They also have a yummy sandwich and salad menu all made with fresh, local ingredients. So BUCK the BUCKS and grab a CUP at Echo coffee!

I drive all the way from Chapparal to get my nails and toes done here! Best place I've ever been! Amy is amazing at nails of all kinds and designs and Heidi is the best pedicurist. They are so kind, offering water and snacks too! Very sanitary and great attention to detail! Totally worth the drive!!!

I've been seeing Dr. Sorr since he opened his doors. I've never felt so comfortable and at home than being in his office. He never rushes our time together and he genuinely cares about my health history as it relates to getting to the root of my problems.  I recently started my Prolotherapy treatment and I feel confident this is the solution I've been waiting for to cure my chronic back pain.  I've also had immunity IV therapy and will be using Dr. Sorr for all of my medical needs moving forward.  If you want hands on, personalized care- look no further. I wish I hadn't waited so long!!
