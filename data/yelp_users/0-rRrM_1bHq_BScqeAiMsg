I would be amazed if my order was EVER right.  Ordered a thin bagel toasted.  Received a regular bagel not toasted.  Asked for potato salad for my side, received fruit.  Literally some of the most incompetent people working here.  Also their restrooms are disgusting.  Hope their corporate pays more attention soon.

I will be the first to admit I am sort of a Thai food snob.   The tom yum gai was delish! The pad-thai was so-so.  I have definately had better.  I think that overall though it is for sure worth checking it out!

Andrew was the best server! Made our experience at Upper Crust memorable. I cannot wait to go back! Best food, best drinks, best service I've ever had!

I started with a Groupon back in January and have been hooked ever since! I go to class at least 3-4 times a week.  The instructors are all great and will help you achieve that next level that often is hard to do on your own. I've lost almost 15 lbs and have so much more energy!  This is one Groupon I didn't regret buying!
