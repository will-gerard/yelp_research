One of my all time favorite spots! The basement bar is fantastic. The atmosphere, the service, the music, the fireplace, the comfortable bar stools, the clientele, are all great.  Generally my wife and I have gone here for reverse-HH, $5 wine and $5 small plates. (You cannot miss with the Tri-color roasted pepper bruschetta). Truth be told, we rarely stick to just the HH items. I can't resist the Rokerij salad (a magical wedge...get it with the turkey) and a good G&T (a nice pour and a 4.5 oz bottle of Fever Tree tonic). If HH isn't your thing, go for brunch or....dinner...as we finally did last Sunday.   A group of six of us came in for dinner, aside from an awesome meal and great service (thank you, Jamie), we lucked into coming in on a day when they were serving green chile stew (spice-tastic) and 1/2 off bottles of wine. What?!?!? It was fantastic. My wife loved the smoked turkey and the green chile pork enchiladas (thanks, Richardson's) and another member of the party claimed the top sirloin was "the best she'd ever had." A great night was had by all. If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out.

Good food and good service. I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I like it all. Don't let the westside strip mall location deter you. Get the handmade corn tortillas with whatever you order. Try the huevos rancheros, tampeque√±a, or camarones a la diabla. I also enjoy the micheladas (large and cold). Also a great stop if you are trekking across Glendale to watch the Coyotes or Cardinals.

Ongoing horrible service experiences. I have been to this location 3 times. It is the closest to my house. And, each of these times I was intending to make a purchase. Yet, each time I have left empty handed as a result of poor service and purchased the item elsewhere. Today was the last straw. Two employees said they'd be right with us. Yet 15 minutes later we were waiting as they stood around behind the counter. While waiting we walked over to the two phone models we had come in to see. Both were not working. When we asked a rep about them, we were told the stations they were attached to were broken so they couldn't charge them. We asked if they had another pair they could show us. We were told that wasn't possible (at the next store we went to it was) but we could but one and if we didn't like it we'd only be charged a $50 restocking fee to return it. At that point, we left. We won't be back. T-Mobile should be glad not all of their stores are like this one, or there would be no T-Mobile.

This food is great. As an appetizer try the green mussels with Thai herbs and spicy lime dressing, Follow that up with the Tom Yaam Talay (hot and sour soup with mushrooms, lime, galangal, lemongrass, herbs, jumbo prawn, scallop, calamari, salmon and mussels) or the amazing chicken panang.   The atmosphere in the bar is great. Enjoy a glass of wine or Basil Hayden's, sit back and enjoy some live music.   If you like Thai food, all in all you'll find Satara a good evening with great food.

Go for the Guacamole and the Sangria!   I am a fan of the Camelback Inn. It is a great place to get away from the Valley while in the Valley. It's atmosphere and elegance are wonderful and only matched by the red sangria made at the R Bar. It's fresh with delicious bits of fruit and with just the right amount of  sweetness. My wife and I stopped in after dinner one night and spent the evening finishing a pitcher of this great nectar of the gods. Moreover the R Bar atmosphere adds to the experience. We spent part of the evening lounging on a comfortable couch in the corner and the rest staring at the stars while sitting around one of the outdoor fire rings. Looking for a romantic end to the night or a great place to meet up with friends for a special escape? I highly recommend the R Bar.

Still love this place! Always a pleasure. Today my wife and I enjoyed breakfast there (served all day on Sunday -til 11 on Tues - Sat). First we enjoyed a delicious cappuccino and latte. Then, for our meals my wife had the Emily (eggs, capers and spinach on a telera roll), and I went the opposite (aka meaty) direction and ordered Porky's panini (pork patties and bacon smothered in the "biscuits and gravy" gravy  put between delicious bread and then placed in a panini press). We enjoyed both items.   We were both full and happy after that. But, you can't leave Rayner's without a truffle or pastry. We each sampled the goat cheese and dates dark chocolate truffle and the fresh plum puff. The truffle was creamy chocolate, decadent, deliciousness and the puff was light, flaky, and fruity.   This is a gem in the fabric of the west valley. Don't pass it by.

This place is a fantastic place in the westside. Great tacos, tortas, and burritos. We've had the camaron, pastor, asada,and chorizo. All delicious. There are 6 folding tables available and, of course, you can take them home. Check the hours before you go. Showing up when they are not there can be a real bummer.

While we've had numerous opportunities to try other Humble Pie locations, we've always opted for something else. There are much better pizzas in the valley (even on the west side). The pizza was cold and bland. The service was lousy.  We were incredibly disappointed and won't be going back.

Best customer service from a T-Mobile store! We were looking for a new phone for my wife. We visited another T-Mobile store in the area whose service was terrible. So we left and came to this store. Joe, our sales associate, answered all of our questions about the two phones we were debating between. He demonstrated features of each, explained the benefits of each, and ensured the phone we purchased was operational before we left the store. He was personable, professional, and customer focused. Soon I will be upgrading my phone as well. When the time comes, I will be heading here first.

Good happy hour! Delicious street tacos: costilla, octopus, pollo as a do, and braised pork,  all $1 off during HH. Also your choice of 5 of 10 tacos plus chips for 4.75 @ HH. $5 house margs and house wines @ HH. And, HH goes until 7. Well done. We'll be back for a full dinner.
