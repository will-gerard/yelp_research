After getting in a car accident, I needed to see a chiropractor and was told to try here. It is great! The entire staff is very friendly and informative. I'm no stranger to chiropractors, having seen one a lot as a child, and they do the right amount of hands on crackin' I like, combined with certain machines (The roll table rocks!).  They also provide stretching exercises depending on the area that is having most problems.  They do focus mainly on spinal issues and talk about Subluxation (when a vertebrae is out of line and creates pressure on nerves).   They handle more than just accident victims and I will continue to see them for preventative maintenance.   Pop in and try them out sometime!  They also have a masseuse on staff.

I guess I don't know what I should have expected.  I had gone to a Chevy's once many many years ago, but couldn't remember how it was.  We were at the mall and decided to give it a shot.  When we walked in, the hostess was very nice and sat us.  After that, it was pretty much downhill.  The waiter wasn't very friendly and somewhat short with us.  He didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  The salsa that was brought out to us looked like it had been prepackaged, sitting around and was in the shape of some other bowl.  It didn't taste much better either.  I ordered the grilled chicken tacos.  The beans were alright, as was the rice.  The taco was dry and bland in some areas, except in the center, where the dab of sauce was.  It only made it taste like a chicken ranchero taco from Taco Bell.  Not something I'd want again.  It's not authentic at all, which is fine, but make it taste good.  I will not go back again.

On a drive to Jerome, my wife and I got hungry after stopping at the outlet mall.  We decided to stop at the next place with food.  We saw the sign, Rock Springs Cafe, but I was hesitant to risk what would be my first night away from the kid on some "road stop cafe" that would leave me seeing nothing but the bottom of a porcelain bowl the rest of the trip.  However, there was a sign that said PIE.    I. Love. Pie.  So, we stopped.  I am so glad we did!  Once we were seated, I pulled out my phone and checked yelp.  Scary, because at that point I was committed.  I had a glass of tea and everything.  Luckily, almost all of the reviews were great.  That put me at ease.  The people were friendly and let me know what was good on the menu.  I had the chicken and biscuits.  It was pretty good, but nothing that blew me away.  I'm sure there were better things on the menu, and it was lunch, so it felt a little too heavy, but that's my fault.  But, I was still not disappointed with my choice.  My wife had a burger and she loved it.  Now, the pie.  My wife got the chocolate cream pie.  It was ok.  A little disappointing.  Nothing bad, it's just we've both had better.  However, I had the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie and it is by far the best Pecan Pie I have ever had.  Pecan was never my favorite of the pies, but this one puts it on the list.  This place was so good, we stopped on our way home from Jerome and I got a whole JD Pecan Pie, and a slice of the Mixed Berry Crumble.  It was so delicious.  My wife got a peanut butter brownie thing with chocolate on it.  She said it was good.  I couldn't try it due to my lack of liking peanut butter in my sweets.  I know, right.  But, she knows her peanut buttery sweets.  The awesome thing about this place, other than their pie being amazing, is they also ship their pies!  So, I may have to partake in the ordering of pies.  Who needs birthday cake when you can have birthday pie?

This place is delicious!  My wife first took me here a while ago and I wasn't so sure, but she kept wanting to go, and I expanded my selections.  I've had a large number of their items.  Right now, my favorite is their baked beef lasagna.  I can't seem to get enough of it.  Their pizzas are really good.  The cheese pizza and the chicken w/ white sauce one (can't remember the actual names) are my two favorites.  As for sandwiches, I'm a big fan of the meatball, but I ask for it on the old style bread, just a regular bread that is used for panini instead of the more wrap like bread (I don't really know why they switched.)  The Caesar salad is good and the meat salad that isn't on the menu is excellent.  One mention, I don't know why, but I find the tea they make here is the best of any restaurant that I've gone to.  My wife always gets the Pasta, Chicken and Broccoli, without the broccoli.  It's alright, but I want something more exciting.  The staff is usually friendly, and certain members recognize us and talk about how big my son is getting.  It's really nice to be greeted like that.

I love this place!  I eat here around 3 times a week during my lunch break from work across the street.  It's cheap and a lot of food.  The lunch is $4.99 plus tax.  A few of my favorites are the lo mein (shrimp is my fav.), shrimp or chicken and broccoli, kung pao, and chicken with cashews.  Usually I'll ask for everything extra spicy and they have no problem doing that.  I've tried almost everything on the lunch menu, and only not cared for one item, but it's just because it's not my thing.  Everything is made to order and is delicious.  As for the sides, the fried rice is great and the egg rolls and wonton soup are awesome.  The people are extremely friendly as well.  They've gotten to know my name as well as my coworkers.    The seating is limited, but it's all about the food there.  I usually pick it up and go.  They also deliver!  I'll continue to come here until I move.  It is one of my favorites!

I drive by this antique store everyday on my way home from work.  After reading the reviews, I decided to take my wife and kid to try it out.  It was amazing!  I got the Arizonan and the Chili dog.  Both were excellent and was sad I couldn't finish it because I was so full.  But, I took it home and the owner even gave me some extra chili in there.    We have issues getting my 14 month old to eat sometimes, but he scarfed down most of his lil' willy.  My wife thought hers was excellent too.  She said it's one of the best hot dogs she's had, and she's from Chicago.    I definitely recommend this place.  The owner even came out and talked to us a little and made sure everything we had was perfect.  I will definitely be going here again.

This review is for this location only.  At first, everything was alright here.  Just your typical Dunkin.  Good donuts and good coffee.  However, over time, they have screwed up my order over and over again.  First, I received no sugar and no cream in my coffee after asking for it, only to realize it when I got to work.  I figured it was a fluke.  The next day, I received no sugar.  I called and spoke to the manager.  She was very friendly and told me I'd receive a free coffee next time.  Cool.  That was fine.  The next time, I received my free coffee and was given the wrong donuts I requested.  The next time I went, I still didn't get the correct donuts.  In fact, I've been a handful of times since this occurred and they've always screwed up my order in one way or another.  I understand things happen, but every time is too much.  The line gets too long on my way to work, which isn't a big deal, but if I'm not going to get the correct order, I'm not going back.  I guess it's easier on my wallet and belt anyway.
