I normally don't go to Yelp to vent, in fact most reviews that I actually do are raves. This one warrants a review so I can hopefully ward off anyone else looking to score a deal. I really wish I did my homework prior to going in, but I honestly went because I was tempted by the coupons. I wanted a full set of acrylics and know the drill. I was immediately sat down in a chair...next to someone else still getting her manicure. I sat there twiddling my thumbs for several minutes until I was finally waited on.   However, I was quickly  just one of several customers this one lady was trying to attend to all at once. I'm sorry, but rushing through the job doesn't make me happy. After arriving home, a friend pointed out that there was no top layer to my nails! I was in such a hurry to get out....after being neglected for 15 minutes, that I failed to notice this. Apparently it costs $15 extra for a UV gel topcoat, and one, I was not offered this. And two, even if I was, I would have politely declined. That doesn't mean you should not put on ANY sort of top coat, gel or not! My nails chipped within two hours! Super disappointed I spent any money on this place. They clearly do not have have customer service standards. Do not recommend to anyone.

A few years ago, I made the decision to leave the school I had worked at for three years. I was a bit sad, but mostly I was sad that I would no longer get to go to the "Bagel Shop" as many of us call it, every day. I loved the food here and went there maybe a bit too much but, hey when you find a place you love, you keep going. The staff is nice especially Mark and they treat everyone like a regular. I sometimes still make the 40+ minute drive to just go here.
