What a great staff, excellent service and a place that remembers that "Customers" are the way the bills get paid. Although I didn't have time to get into the store before my coupon expired, I called ahead and they not only had my shoes waiting for me (because they know my size and preference), but honored the coupon which had been expired for almost a week. WOW me! Thanks so much.

OMG. Cafe Bella used to be at this location and everytime we went in, they were painting or building. The Calabria folks have got it DONE and ready to go. Went for lunch and had the Eggplant Parmagiana sub. It was fantastic. The eggplant was sliced on the vertical, rather than the usual horizontal. Very thinly sliced, lightly breaded and just so freakin' delicious!  Huge portion of the eggplant and incredible marinara sauce on the sub roll, so much that I didn't even touch the roll! It sure looked yummy and was getting rave reviews from my compadres at lunch.  Not ordered, but delivered, a mini cannoli for each of us. Just the perfect end to a scrumptious meal. Atmosphere was nice, very casual...order at counter and they brought out our food.   Mamma Mia. That was a great Italian lunch!

While the food is OK, the prices are obscene-even by Snottsdale standards. Yesterday our waiter couldn't have spelled his name right, let alone get our order straight. Fish & Chips instead of French Dip? That's hangover hearing!!! This was our second (and last) trip. No happy hour pricing and spotty service aren't a match for the nice venue-AZ has lots of pretty that comes with great food and service. Sayonara TPC.

If I could marry soup, I would do it. I mean, I love soup more than life itself, and there are days when I have a soup that makes my husband come in a distant second (and I love HIM to pieces). This is how I feel when I order soup from Vermont Sandwich Company. Today's choices, Roast Beef Vegetable & Chicken Florentine were both fantastic. Yep, I orderd a cup of each instead of a soup and a sandwich...seriously, it's THAT FREAKING GOOD!  They make these soups fresh every day, so you call in the morning to find out what today's pot of gold will be. A few weeks ago, I called the day before and not only did they not know yet what the soups would be the next day, I GOT TO PICK THEM! Holy mother of Pearl, did that make me a happy girl!   The standard French Onion is incredible, but the potato leek or corn chowder are also fantastic. Heck, I haven't ordered a soup yet that didn't put me over the moon. In store one day, got to sample the Country Apple as well...(drool).  And don't forget the cookies. Yep, Maple bacon...just saying.

While this is a beautiful property, they are in no way, shape or form ready for large conventions. With only one ballroom, we had to clear out of meetings and wait in a small hallway while the staff set up for meals. This morning we have 1 hour for breakfast buffet. There is one table with food and over 300 people to be served. Really??? And they're all lined up in the sun. I'm just hoping it won't require medical intervention.  Later today: At 9:45, I finally sat down to eat my buffet breakfast, which had opened at 9am. Yep...it took 45 minutes to get to the end of the line. About one minute (literally) after I sat down, the staff started breaking down the juice bar. They continued to refill the food and coffee, but took the juice away. The two ladies who did this, also watched as the wind knocked over some tall table decorations (hotel decoration, not our convention), and said to each other, "I knew that would happen," then looked the other way. Guess that part wasn't in their job description.  On Saturday, there was an invitation only breakfast for the convention, leaving the restaurant as the only place to dine. They had a hostess and 2 waitresses for approximately 40 tables and 100 guests. My check was delivered before my food (45 minutes). My breakfast was comped (hostess was very apologetic), and delicious (oatmeal and bacon), but I saw several others leave without ever receiving food. Not prepped for the onslaught of conventioneers.  I hate giving one star to a place with excellent food, beautiful room and a 50% "give a crap" ratio on their staff, but this rating is for convention-appropriateness.

Am glad my hubby liked his sushi, as I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences ever here.  Our waitress was not exactly a firecracker, spoke very softly in a room full of loud bikers, and didn't seem in any hurry to help us.  I am not a fish fan, but dearly love shellfish, so the grilled shrimp risotto sounded quite nice. Hubby's sushi arrived and he started in on it and was making nummy noises! When my plate of shrimp and risotto was tossed (literally) in front of me, I was expecting to be doing the same. Put a shrimp in my mouth and it was stone cold in the middle. Thought maybe this was a fluke, so went for #2. Not only was it even colder, but it had a funny taste and a fairly dry, rubbery texture.  When the waitress returned, I asked if the shrimp was meant to be cold. She said no, and asked if I wanted her to get me another dish. I asked if the shrimp would be hot this time. She said yes, and took my dish. A few minutes later she returned with my original dish, risotto re-piled in the middle, with fresh greens and the remaining 5 shrimp from my first order.   Shrimp were now warm, but VERY dry, rubbery and had a funny taste to them. When she returned again, I told her that the shrimp tasted funny and hubby showed her how dry they were. He asked if the shrimp had been frozen and she said yes.   She returned a few minutes later to tell me that I was eating my meal incorrectly. Apparently, after 50 years, I am unable to dine in a restaurant without instruction! I was told that the shrimp were intentionally bland, because I was supposed to cut them up and stir them in with the flavorful risotto and sprouts. I advised her that the shrimp wasn't bland, it tasted funny, rubbery and dry. No response. No offer to get a different meal for me. Nothing. No adjustment was made to our check and my strongly worded letter to Kabuki will be for a full refund, no gift card, as I wouldn't be caught DEAD there again..

I'm not sure how a place that has "loud" "energetic" and "vibrant" in almost every review decides that MY party was the loud one, but being threatened to be kicked out of a restaurant is not how my dinners usually go.  Yep. the food is good, if overpriced.  Yep, we had a couple of cocktails.  But we were seated in the BAR-clearly the noisiest part of the entire building and my friend was approached in the BATHROOM (really?) by the manager and told we needed to quiet down. Same manager came to our table a bit later and told us that he had received complaints about our noise level and that we needed to decide if we were going to quiet down and stay, or "shake hands and part friends right now". WOW-pretentious much???  If I'd had a gaggle of bubble-headed Scottsdale Barbies with me maybe I'd have no reason to make a complaint, but the youngest person in my "party" was 32 and the oldest 80...how noisy could we have been???  So, thanks for buzzkilling my birthday party.

Okay, seems a bit strange to have two entrances that lead to the same place, but I "get" uniqueness. Lounge looked very attractive, but we asked to be seated in dining room. Beautiful atmosphere-love the art-love the water feature. WTH is up with the wall sconces that look like sperm?   The water with cucumber slice was very refreshing and she kept the water coming. I was surprised by their excellent draught beer selection, being a wine place and all. The wine selection looked fantastic and I'm sure that we'll be back to put a dent in that wall o' wine!  I ordered the cashew chicken-mild (I'm a Thai weinie!) and it was terrific. Very large portion. Sauce was excellent. I'm not a big bell pepper fan, so next time will order without the peppers although not so many that I couldn't pick them out.  Hubby ordered the Green Curry Fried Rice with Chicken-Medium-(always test the first time out!) It was fantastic. I think next time he'll order the next step up and if I ordered this, I'd be able to handle the Medium.   Presentation was wonderful, so the food was not only tasty, but looked beautiful as well.   I'm anxious to go back and hit up the soups and appetizers, but just knew from previous Yelpers that I would be getting a large entree and didn't have the room!

We did a two night "staycation" here. It's very close to my work, so my commute was cut down to almost nothing, making for a very relaxing stay.  For a hotel of this class...very nice. Breakfast was terrific, healthy options, even whole grain batter for the waffle maker. Fruit toppings for waffles were a nice touch. Great selection of food here. Our room was nice, roomy, comfortable, well-appointed.   Staff were very friendly, the front desk had folks waiting at prime check in time. May have to do it again next week!!!

When I have "nails" I come here for my nail work. All of the employees are nice-very talented and friendly. While Monica is the main nail "artist" there is a newer employee who also does nail art-over and above the regular gels or polish. Both are quite talented (although I have to admit, I'm more familiar with Monica's work-and it's fantastic!)  They have a very clean shop, Andy is super nice and professional. They are always willing to fix one of my claws when I make a mess of something.   Prices are great as well for manis, pedis and waxing. I find it to be a neighborhood gem!

Took my co-workers out for lunch today and picked Bliss. We are all now full of Bliss! Around the table I saw Loaded Mac N Cheese, Naked Mac N Cheese, Three Tacos, Chicken Sandwich and Veggie Sandwich. As usual with this crew, the shoestring potatoes (we picked salt/vinegar) were done to perfection. All of the sandwiches were served with a small side of veggie slaw (red cabbage/carrot), which disappeared all around. Sadly there was no room for dessert, which sounded fantastic. Equally as sad...no alcoholic beverages for us, since we were headed back to work. The patio area is quite large and as soon as the temp dips, we'll be asking for that seating...such a beautiful building.

I am again amazed at how awesome this place is. A busy Friday night and the hostess gals are cool, calm and collected. I sit outside in the freezing (you know, 50 degrees!) weather for my table, under a nice warmer and they bring me a DRINK! Cool beans!  I am such a weird eater, and make that disclaimer to all our wait staff. So the polenta appetizer and a side of beets for dinner doesn't even make her bat an eye. And both are fantastic. The beets come with pears, romano cheese shavings and pistachios. (There were some greens on top, but I dispensed with them---way too healthy!) The polenta is cooked, sliced into sticks, fried and covered in parmesan (do you feel the "cheese" theme?). The grapefruit ginger wine cooler recommended by one of the wait staff was a great compliment to my selections.  Hubby had the "Big Star" pizza, a manly and meaty pizza, which he completely devoured. He had a nice small pitcher of beer that fit the bill.  We were too stuffed to even think about dessert, but we'll be back (maybe tomorrow?) to hit that part of the menu.   As stated in countless other reviews, ambiance is great, menu swell and I have to say, after the week I had dealing with snarly vendors, what a nice change of pace in the service department!  Love Churn, Love Windsor and now I officially (YELP) Love Federal Pizza!

Parking in front of Aaron's is so wonderful. The valet is always helpful and the new reservation system divine. Giving customers a beer and a photo shoot was a genius touch. Why park anywhere else?

Doug and his team helped us pull off an AMAZING beer dinner as a surprise birthday party. We selected items from the menu, which Terry paired so well with the available beers. We were lucky enough to be seated in the brewhouse and our intimate party of 12 could hear all about the beer and food, as well as hear each other talk! The beers here are amazing as well.Looking forward to tasting new food from the new Exec chef.  Thanks again Doug & Terry!!!
