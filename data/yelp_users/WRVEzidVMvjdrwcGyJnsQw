I lived in this neighborhood growing up. Every now and again, I would write down my family's order, grab the cash, and peddle my way up Granite Reef to Casella's. My mom and my favorite is their chicken salad sandwich, my brother's favorite is the pizza sub, and everyone loved their AMAZING potato salad.   The family-owned business is exactly the same today as it was when I first starting eating there nearly 20 years ago (admitting  how long it has been is hard).   Everyone complains about them being cash-only.  They have ALWAYS been cash-only, and I like that about them.  They have quality ingredients, are always friendly when you walk in the door, and time and time again, give a great product.   I live in Tempe now, and I go out of my way to order from them instead of the chain down the street -- gotta keep the local businesses alive!!   LOVE IT!

My boyfriend and I love this restaurant. Typically, we split a meal because the portions are huge.   Favorite appetizer (and the ONLY one in my opinion): Mini Tacos.  My favorite dish: Carne Adovada (but I love this dish anywhere I go)   The food is pretty much standard, good Mexican food, but the Mini Tacos rock my world. Don't order them if you are trying to be health-conscious. You will immediately regret your decision.   Great for large parties, and they cater. SO YUMMY!

LOVE THIS PLACE!   I have been going here for years, and absolutely adore this restaurant.  The place is dimly lit (even during the day) and boasts a huge patio. The bar has a bunch of kitschy crap all over the wall that is fun to look at.   Without going into a huge story about all the times I've been here, I'll just list all the food I love:  Portales Portobello, Sweet Mash, Boneless Chicken Wings (late night menu only), Cheese Crisp, seasoned fries, Spinach Salad, Spicy Crab Cakes, Green Chile Burger, Habenero Burger (it is good, freakin spicy, and comes with a glass of milk), Tortilla Soup, Green Chile Stew, Chile Rellenos, Carne Adovada Plate, Green Chile Mac and Cheese (late night menu), Key Lime Pie, and Basket of Sopas.   I bet I am forgetting some things, but basically, all I am trying to say is that this place is the bomb diggity.   OH! They also have a really great Sunday brunch with cheap breakfast, bloodies and mimosas.

The wiz wit is ... perfectly sinful (cheese steak with cheese wiz and fried onions). Jalapeños are good on it also.   My boyfriend and I stopped by there for a late night meal on a recent local cruiser ride. I can sum it up as just plain old good drunk food.  The also deliver locally. SWEET.

Reasons Why I Love CPC:  GREAT FOOD GREAT PRICES GREAT ATMOSPHERE NICE STAFF DELIVERY!!   I had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until I went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago. Ever since my first visit, I have been hooked. I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.    The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency.    Another time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch.     I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus.    My new favorite "every-now-and-again" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.     To be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner.    Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING!   Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well.    They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3! YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!   Dine in, take out, or delivery. It doesn't matter how you get it, just GET IT! Make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing--you will be happy that you did.

The sliders are super yummy, and the happy hour is good.    I love the fact that this place serves tots, and have exotic burger choices.  Two sliders is a perfect small meal, and it is fun to build a unique one.  Service is friendly, and the restaurant is clean and contemporary.

I wish I could give this place 6 stars.   We purchased the Groupon and went on the same night to unPhogettable.  By 6PM, this place was boomin.    We ordered the soft summer rolls (pork sausage), #8 (Pho with brisket and flank) and the #48 (steamed rice with seasoned grilled sliced beef).   The summer rolls were very good and came with a delish house sauce.  We hadn't received our dinners yet when a server came over and asked if we had the Groupon.  We said yes, and she explained that they couldn't accept it until the next day.  We hadn't read that on the deal, so I was a little frustrated (not mad, but just like, 'dangit!').  The owner stopped by and we talked to him for a few minutes.  We looked at our Groupon and saw that it DID say it couldn't be used until the next day.  So it was totally our over-sight.    He explained that a few tables had gotten mad and walked out, and they only did the Groupon to get new people to try their restaurant since June is the quietest month for most restaurants in the valley.  We told him that we didn't care about the Groupon, and were there for the food not the deal.  We decided we would just use the Groupon the next weekend.   Needless to say, he was very excited and grateful. I think we were more excited about our dinners though.    When our meals came out, he showed us the Vietnamese way to eat Pho and the rice and meat plate.  That was really cool.  It was obvious that he took great pride in his restaurant and food, and wanted to make sure everyone was happy.   I can't explain how amazing the food was. The #48 came with a broth on the side that you eat first to cleanse your palate.  I could have just eaten that as my meal and been totally satisfied.  The sauce on the beef was hard to explain.  It was slightly sweet, but had a lot of depth.  I was reluctant to share.   The Pho broth was fantastic.  After all of the noodles, meat and bean sprouts were gone, and we were both stuffed, I couldn't stop sipping the broth.  Seriously. It was so good, I didn't mind over-stuffing myself.   We said we would be back next weekend.  I don't think I can wait that long.

My boyfriend and I took my mom here last night to try her first taste of Thai food.   There happy hour boasts a decent list of cheap appetizers, so we ordered the shrimp and veggie tempura, crab puffs, and beef satay with three Thai teas.  All of our appetizers came out quickly and were fantastic. I love the peanut sauce that comes with the satay. My boyfriend's favorite appetizer is crab puffs, and they were crispy, and not over-fried/greasy.   For entrées, my mother ordered the Mango Delight with shrimp, my boyfriend ordered his staple of Paht Thai noodles, and I got my favorite: Red Curry.  The server advised my mother that Thai spice is different than other spice, so ordering her dish mild may be wise.   We had never tried the Delight before. It was sweet and spicy with crunchy vegetables, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. My mom absolutely loved it.   The prices are decent, and the service was good. We had a ton of leftovers (which I can't complain about!)

We had their Groupon and decided to try it on our way up to North Phoenix.  We ordered the Green Chili and Beef Frybread Taco and their Red Chili Stew to go. We ate the frybread while driving. The whole thing was absolutely bland. I found 1 sliver of beef in the whole thing. Very disappointing.   I suggested to my fiancée that maybe the stew would be better. I grabbed the bag from the floor board and set it in my lap. I took out the frybread, and instantly felt the worst pain on my thigh. The boiling-hot magma stew had soaked through the bag and sent a raging inferno to my inner thigh. Yelling and crying, I set the bag on the flood board.  We pulled into a Walgreens to grab some burn ointment and clean my jeans off.   I tried moving the bag and the paper tore and the rest of the stew spilled on the floor.    Advice for the restaurant: if you want repeat business, don't serve still-boiling stew to new customers in a g-d paper cup!.

2 stars for good food but crappy service.   I was raised on Indian food, and know what I like. I heard that Tandoori  times was a great restaurant, so my boyfriend and I decided to eat there a few weeks back. I had been looking for a new Indian restaurant and was excited to try it out.    The restaurant was busy, and we waited about 5 minutes until a table was available.  We were seated on the patio behind a pillar (bad idea). Our server came over after a few minutes to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks, and we were unsure as to what we wanted to order for dinner but we ordered the aloo tikki to start.   The appetizer took a long time to come out (about 20 minutes) and our server didn't come back to take our order until shortly before our appetizer arrived.  We ordered the bengun bhartha and chicken curry with garlic naan.   Another 20 or so minutes went by after we were finished with our appetizer before we saw our server again. He set our dishes down and asked if we wanted anything else. I asked if we could have a side of rice because I just guessed that he had forgotten it, or it was on its way as all Indian places I have been to serve rice as an accompaniment to dishes.   I told my boyfriend I didn't want to eat my meal without rice, so I waited about 10 minutes.... no rice... our server continued serve other tables and walk away before my boyfriend could flag him down. Finally, I decided to not let the already mildly cool food get colder, so I reluctantly began eating.   The curry tasted great and was well spiced.  I also loved the bengun bhartha (I have only found one place that makes it the way I like it).   After we were done eating the two dishes, the server finally came over (no rice in hand) to ask how our meal was.  My boyfriend politely asked for boxes, our rice to go (since they seemed to be still cooking it), and the check.  We waited another 5 or so minutes to get our bill, and the server says, "don't worry about the rice.... it's on me"  WHAT?? WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR RICE????   My boyfriend got up and went looking for the manager. He spoke to the hostess and found out the manager had stepped away, but she called and spoke to him. My boyfriend explained our experience, and how it was our first time dining there. The manager said that we would either wait for him to return, or the hostess could take 15% off our bill.  Not wanting to wait any longer for anything else, my boyfriend just asked for the discount.   The food was great, but the service was crap. Absolute crap. Unfortunately, due to that first impression, I don't want to go back.

I have never had REAL ramen until I came here. I had been raised thinking ramen was just noodles in a package that you boil for 3 minutes and add the contents of a silver packet (predominately made of sodium), and voilà!   This place is fantastic delicious offering ramen, udon and rice dishes with fresh ingredients for about 6.50 an item. The servings are absolutely huge, but fantastic.    My boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. It was quiet inside, but the cashier explained they just finished with their dinner rush.  I ordered the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the curry rice with a side order of goyoza. There were three goyoza to an order, and to be honest, they were small for the price.  The miso ramen and the curry rice were both very good.   We went there a week later (due to a hankering of mine) and decided to share a bowl of the republic ramen along with edamame and veggie tempura. All of it was delish.   The only downside to the restaurant is that it smells like a grease fryer.  When we left, our clothes stank like grease.     Other than the smell of grease, the place is fantastic.

I have finally found a good Chinese restaurant nearby.  I've ordered from here twice, and both times, we have been pleasantly surprised.  No super greasy, overcooked food that tastes like oil and salt.  The dishes have a ton of flavor and perfectly cooked.   The first time, my partner and I shared broccoli beef and cashew chicken with an order of pot-stickers.  Even after being in the take-out box, the broccoli was crisp and green.  We both thought the dumplings were hand-made and he loved them. The leftovers lasted us two more meals.   Last night, my friend and I ordered takeout. We shared the kung pao chicken, an order of crab angels, and egg drop soup.  Great prices, and again, still leftovers! My only complaint is that there wasn't more filling in the crab angels.    Great food for a good value.
