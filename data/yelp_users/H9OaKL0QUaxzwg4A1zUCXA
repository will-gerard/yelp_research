Course quality was great but the rangers were aggressive and unfriendly.  It ultimately ruined our day.  I'd play here again,  for the benefit of the doubt, but with the other choices in the valley, they'd better up their hospitality Little bit.

Dr. O'Connor and Sabrina do a great job!  My wife and I have been patients of theirs for about 2 months now and we're more than pleased with our HCG results.  They are approachable and friendly and more importantly have a more realistic approach to the weight-loss program.    If there was a slight crticism, I would say that it can get a little crazy in their very small office between the hours of 10am and 1pm.  It's not uncommon to have 4 or 5 people waiting to see them.   With the space being so tight, it can feel claustrophobic.    Other than that, I've had great service and great results.  I highly recommend visiting with them to see if their programs are right for you.

I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of Store Manager, Mike from Massachusetts and Sales Rep Matt for their efforts in helping me fix a weird problem today at the Verizon Store.   Long story short, I had a purchased a NEST Thermostat that ended up causing some damage to my house and so I asked Verizon's online customer service if I could return it. It was outside of the return window and a very abnormal problem so I was pleased when the online service told me that all I had to do was bring it into the store to complete the return.   The problem was that the online rep never notated the account properly for the store to complete the return and never issued the credit to my account. I told Matt and Mike the situation and they offered to help. After about 35 minutes on the phone between Mike the Manager and Verizon's support team, they were finally able to work out a solution to complete the return and VZW's original promise.   Mike could have easily brushed me aside instead of offering to help fix the problem and sent me back on the phone to VZW corporate. Instead, he stood up for the customer (me) when Verizon's customer service tried to finagle a way out of their return promise. That's true customer care - and I am very appreciative.    Thanks Verizon Tempe Team!

I really enjoyed Vovomeena.  The food was excellent and the portions are great.  I would be hesitant to eat there again on a weekend, though.  It was so busy (good for them!)  Hit it up on a lazy Thursday AM for a great, chill, relaxing breakfast.  The Japanese cold brew coffee is very very tasty!

I was very pleased with the service I received this morning from Bird Dog Plumbing.  Last night, our Kitchen sink drain got plugged up pretty badly and wouldn't drain. As an awesome (gross) bonus, there was just enough room for sewer gas to seep through - making our house smell like a cesspool.  I called the guys at Bird Dog simply based on their proximity to my house. The 5-star rating was a bonus. They were very pleasant on the phone, and were able to slot in a stop at my house to fix the drain. Their team of 2 was fast, efficient and very friendly.  They rooted the plugged up drain and checked all my connections to make sure I was good to go.  Bravo to Bird Dog. Will definitely use them again. Hopefully, I won't need them too soon though!

I love The Clever Koi.  They have a killer lunch special - a $5.00 bowl of ramen.  After putting all the fancy stuff in it (meat, egg, bok choi, etc) - it comes out to a still-acceptable 10 or 11 bucks. Delicious. Also, the pork belly bun is also excellent.  Every time we've been there, we were greeted warmly by the owner and had good service at the bar. The bartenders are also excellent there. I really like the French 95(?) cocktail - a mix of champagne and whiskey. Weird but mighty good.  They have a good discount on cocktails at happy hour, too.    Hands down, the Clever Koi is great stuff. I go there as often as I can!

Jerry is a welcoming host at this little sandwich shop. The food is delicious and I really like the interesting selection of breakfast sandwiches available. Get there early and grab a fresh baked muffin too because they are mighty tasty!

Visited The Kettle Black for the first time this week and was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance and location are great, and the appetizers were very tasty!    Every restaurant has some growing pains along the way. Ours was some intermittent service delays - we had to get up from our seats and grab our own side plates, for example. But I chalk it all up the chaos of a grand opening and look forward to going back and upgrading my review to Five Stars when I try the entrees on the menu.
