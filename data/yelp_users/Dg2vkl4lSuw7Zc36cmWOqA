Everyone's food upon arrival was great. Very disappointed with the server/service. Everyone's food came out yet not my plate. They brought my soup and salad but how could you forget the entr√©e? Just slightly confused there.

Staff was very fast and friendly. Came in for a synthetic oil change when it was close to closing. Even though there is a overall low rating I loved my experience and will be returning due to my great experience

You can usually expect good food and service at Outback and today was completely opposite. Came out for my moms birthday dinner and we didn't even care to mention it so we could leave even sooner.  Hopefully they correct their lack of service.

Honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely worth the trip from Mesa.

I originally gave a good rating at this location but I find myself back here due to some errors on my basic oil change. The technician didn't tighten the filter enough so my car lost oil and they didn't reset the gage to prevent my oil light to come on. It's a hassle when you have a 40 min wait based on one of their errors.

I previously gave a bad review only to reverse it on my next visit. The staff was very fast and friendly.  Our sub's came out in very good time and the quality was on point. Very positive experience here! Can't go wrong with the Turkey Bacon Ranch either!

They have a awesome $5 large one topping which includes a flavored crust of your choice. It's a perfect offer to take them up on at anytime!

Overall a great location right in the heart of Tempe! Their cheese curds and BBQ bacon burger I ordered were cooked to perfection. I did order their Maroon and Gold brew which wasn't very impressing, let's just say a similar taste to a Coors Light... I did taste test a couple of their other brews with who I was with which were great! Will be back soon!!

Had my favorite, shack stack, order of crinkle fries and a mango lemonade. Delicious! We also ordered a strawberry shake which was on point. I do think the prices are equivalent or even a tad more than NY (felt that way) which my friend agreed.
