Go somewhere else! This was the worst chix fried steak I've ever eaten. the meat tasted ground processed then re assembled. ..the gravy was separated and u could see the grease oozing out of it. not to mention my over medium eggs that were over hard on bottom side and sunny on top...snotty eggs ruin it for me. potatoes were good but no options to add onion or peppers.one half star only because service was nice young girl but not thorough with coming back around or knowledgeable about how food should be presented. ...I would never have brought what they served me out to a customer and claim that it was normal. stick to the toast.

I took my other half here for fathers day to try the wings, I ordered a grilled chicken salad. It was the worst salad EVER! I couldn't even eat the chicken on it. If thats what it was. It had grill marks on it but tasted boiled, microwaved, dry, and absolutely no taste for $8 bucks. I let the waitress know that the chicken needed improvement as she took my full un-eaten plate away. She laughed and said that's why she orders the breaded.  Really?  Won't go outta my way to eat there again.  BTW the wings were about a 7/10. Since we had other plans, I went hungry the rest of the afternoon.

i dont give out a five star to easily.... here's the low down... PROS: Excellent service. ..fresh  homemade food  (i had the chic fried steak amazing) Delicious  homemade  jam  ..Best biscuits and gravy in valley (could almost pass as my own). The coffee is flavorful not watered down chicory. CONS: Serving portion could be your next 3 meals with a price tag to match.

Great pizza by the slice with Wisconsin mozzarella for $3.00... nearly ate the whole huge slice.  Definitely will be back!

Great food!  There is no place like this on the east side... very unique. Loved the fish and chips ( I actually replaced chips for loaded baked potato)
