This place is terrible with deliveries. If this is the closest pizza place then I would suggest you don't go here or order carry out and pick it up yourself. The last 2 times they have been between 60-75 minutes to deliver. They also don't have the audacity to make it up. Carry out - don't do delivery!!!

NOTE TO TATUM LOCATION MANAGEMENT & REGIONAL MANAGEMENT & GM: This gym needs to put a portion of your budget to go back into this location. The machines are so outdated, no one can turn to an FM/AM channel to listen to the tv's it's 2015 LA Fitness.  Lastly- please clean this gym thoroughly every day. At least clean the shower and renew it. The mats are brown, dirt everywhere, shower rods are so rusted they sprinkle rust on the ground from the curtains, etc. I'm surprised the health department hasn't closed this location down.   How many negative reviews and complaints will it take to motivate you all to take action and get this done. I hope you actually manage your reputation because at some point this will come back to haunt you. It's pretty sad how much mountainside fitness and other competitors out perform your gym especially this one. Please make things happen and actually invest back into your locations. PLEASE!

Bomb food. Little pricy but so good. Great burger too. Closed way to early of NYE though.
