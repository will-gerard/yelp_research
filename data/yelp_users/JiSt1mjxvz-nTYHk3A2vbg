My (now) husband bought me a beautiful necklace from Shane when we were dating. He purchased my engagement ring there, and I went back to get my wedding ring from them as well. He also purchased earrings, a bracelet and a necklace for me to wear on our  wedding day.   My husband had raved and raved about how wonderful Shane Co. had been throughout all these purchases. I have not been there a few times and can say I completely agree!  All the salespeople are genuinely nice people who actually appear to enjoy their jobs. They do not work on commission so you wont get the pressure you get at many other jewelry stores. They have beautiful merchandise and are always willing to work with you to solve any problems and to find exactly what you are looking for.  I would recommend Shane Co. to anyone looking to purchase jewelry and have a great experience. I plan on going back for any future purchases.

This place is consistently great. Awesome service, great food, delicious beer! We love going before catching a movie at Studio Movie Grill or just to grab dinner and a few drinks! Highly recommend!

This place is good but there is a long wait to see an allergist - I typically had to wait 30-60 minutes past my appointment time so plan ahead. Otherwise, everyone was nice and helped me to determine what I was allergic to :)

Susan is great! The day after my wedding i decided to cut my hair short... a new style for me.  They were able to fit me in at the last minute and were one of the only places open on Sunday that was not out of control $$$$. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I came to this salon. The decor is nice, everyone is very friendly. They did am awesome job with my hair and the prices were great!  Been back twice since and I love it!  Highly recommend! The only thing I would change is I wish they had a separate waxing area instead of using the hair wash station chairs. Otherwise great!

My husband and I were married at The Wigwam in March and we couldn't have been happier with our venue choice. We cant say enough good things about the wedding coordinator Allison - she made everything easy! The Wigwam grounds are beautiful, the ceremony site is wonderful and the staff are very accommodating and friendly. My husband and I would recommend The Wigwam to anyone wanting to get married or get away. We cant wait to go back!

I recently went to Abuelos because it was in the middle of where I live and where the people we were meeting live. I was not particularly impressed. The food was bland and was not very good. The salad was awful - it was basically lettuce smothered in cheese and beans and had a weird taste to it. The tortilla chowder also had a strange taste and I could only eat a few bites. The others at my table said their food was just ok - they ordered burritos and fajitas.  The only redeeming thing about going there was the delicious margaritas! I got the Island - with coconut - it was delightful. Otherwise, I would pass.

Love Buffalo Chip!  I've never eaten here but I dig the atmosphere! Fun crowd, pool table, live band, awesome western decor, live bull riding.... all in all a fun way to spend the night if you are looking for something fun and different from the typical Phoenix bar!

This place is awesome.   A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose. They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees. These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.  The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.  They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it.   I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.  Highly recommend it if you are in the area.

The food quality is solid, the people are nice and they have a great selection of beer! They actually carry my favorite beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown - which is great because not many places have it. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high - so happy hour is your friend :)

My boyfriend and I recently went to this show and saw "Murder at the Vampire's Wedding." Although we felt the cast tried to make it fun, we really were not impressed. The actors often came out of character and when they were in character the show was very hokey and pretty lame. They tried to get the crowd involved but it came across as them trying too hard and most people did not seem very impressed - most acted involved to avoid being called out and made to do something even more ridiculous. Additionally, the food was really bad (we went to Cocos). We were counting the minutes until we could leave and will definitely not be returning.

This was an ok Fry's store but much sketchier than others I have been too - granted we were there at night. I would recommend going to another one if possible. There was a guy standing out front without a shirt just hanging out, lots of people standing around in the parking lot, and a security guard in the store.

This place is wonderful!   We found out that our puppy had luxating patella and needed surgery on her knee (one for now, eventually both). We did some research and found that it is very costly. I called University Animal Hospital even though they were in Tempe (we live in N Phoenix) because they had gotten excellent reviews online. As it turned out, they were also the least expensive option for Luna's surgery. Dr. Koch had wonderful reviews so we decided to meet with him and decide if we felt comfortable getting her surgery done there.  Dr. Koch was excellent - way beyond my expectations. I have been to many vets and he is by far the best I have ever encountered. He is extremely kind and understanding and wonderful with our puppy. He explained exactly what would be done, why it needed to be done and made it simple and easy to understand. He was very upfront about everything and even though we were told by a prior vet that she needed all these extra tests, Dr. Koch said we did not. He did not charge us for anything beyond what we needed. He made a very stressful event much more manageable and much easier.   The week after the surgery, Dr. Koch called us every day. Even after, he called us a couple of times a week to check on her and was always available to answer questions, even on weekends. He always returned our calls very quickly.  I highly recommend University Animal Clinic and specifically Dr. Koch to anyone. It is worth the drive for us and we will not be taking Luna anywhere else from now on.

I like this theater - it is always clean and the staff are friendly. They dont let you bring ANY food or beverages in so make sure you finish your coffee before you arrive (learned that the hard way). I usually only go here for a weekend matinee as the prices can be a bit steep otherwise - for later movies i prefer Studio Movie Grill. This place also has the kiosks so it makes getting tickets easy and you can typically avoid long lines.

Went here for happy hour with some friends after work a couple of times.   The service was great,  the atmosphere was pretty cool and the food was better than expected. The specials are decent - they give discounts to all you teachers out there on Tuesday nights.  If you are looking for a chill sports bar to watch some games, eat some bar food and hang out with some friends I would definitely check it out :)

Very good! Set up like Sauce. I got the spinach and mushroom scramble and my husband got a burrito. Both were delicious! Eggs were light and creamy and hash browns were cooked perfectly! Loved all the vegetarian and vegan options. We will be back!

I am not a vegetarian but I enjoy vegetarian/vegan food on occasion. I have seen this place for a while and never made it in. I went for the first tme recently and the food was excellent!! I definitely didnt feel like I was eating vegan food. The prices were great and the service was decent. The only thing that wasnt my style was that the tv only shows the leader of their cult talking about their beliefs. However, this really didnt affect me at all because I went with friends and didnt really watch the tv. Due to the nice atmosphere, the awesome prices and delicius food - I will definitely be returning.

I like this place.  Can't beat a car wash and vacuum for $2.99! There are some things I would change but overall for the price it is completely worth it! The air dryer works but not perfectly so I usually carry a towel to wipe off my car to prevent spots. There are some vacuum areas where you can park where you can use one vacuum for one side of your car and the other for the other side which makes it easier so you don't have to squeeze the vacuum all the way around the car. Bigger cars might need to back in to get the trunk vacuumed but I am able to get everything clean by pulling in front first with my CRV. Overall very impressed I will continue to visit whenever I need to get my car washed!

I come to this location once every two weeks. Great selection of organic vegetables which they rotate so people who buy mostly organic aren't always stuck buying the same vegetables every week. The employees are usually nice and willing to go out of their way to help... only downside is sometimes it is difficult to find someone to help.  Some of the cashiers are a bit quirky but they mean well. Some reviewers complained about long lines but I haven't had a problem with that... however I typically go during the week.  I enjoy shopping here.

I called American Home Water and Air because our AC was leaking water out of the bottom and it was running down the roof. They were able to come out the next day and fixed it on the spot - apparently the line was clogged in two places and some parts needed to be replaced. They were on time, fast and very reasonably priced. I will definitely be using them again!

I had some dents in my windshield and it was recommended that I get it replaced. After doing some research online, I decided to go with Blue Chip as they had very good reviews. I emailed them to set up an appointment and Kelly was very quick to respond to all my emails and answered all my questions. They were able to work around my schedule and promptly scheduled an appointment. The teach showed up right on time (to the minute) and was very nice and helpful. He completed all the work and it looked great! He also answered all my questions and was very professional. Also, because I went through my insurance, they are sending me a $50 rebate check in the mail! I would definitely recommend using Blue Chip and have already recommended them to a couple of friends.

Came here for the first time the other day. Got a brow wax and a pedicure. They did an awesome job with both and I love the atmosphere - very nice! Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it is a but pricy! I got a basic manicure for $20, which is not bad. However, they have many other options available - unfortunately they are quite expensive and I was not able to add on any of the items individually. I did get nail art on my toes and they did an excellent job! I will be returning, but only for the basic pedicure. :)

LOVE this place! Went back for a second time last weekend and had so much fun! The first time we went we saw it on groupon - looked like something fun to do. We loved it so much we went back a second time and had even more fun. Great comedians, great staff, low prices (drinks $5-6, most expensive food item about $9, admission $10-15), and cool atmosphere. Most of the acts were awesome and the headliner Laughlin was hilarious! I laughed so hard I cried!! Howard, the owner, is super nice and super funny and he remembered us which was awesome. Can't wait to go back!

Delicious and healthy food! I am all about eating healthy and cutting out pesticides and this place fits the bill. Their food is fresh and delicious and they have a wide range of foods to fit many different diet choices. I will definitely come back. The only drawback is the vegetarian options are a little more expensive then most other places.

Went here for brunch for the first time on 7/26. There were 6 of us. When we arrived at 10am, there was only one other table seated. We all ordered - my husband and I both ordered the breakfast burrito without bacon as we are both vegetarian. Time passed and everyone received their food except us. Our friends wanted to wait, but after about 10 mins we insisted they eat, as their food was getting cold. Another table seated 10 mins after we arrived also ordered two burritos, and received their food while we were still waiting. We asked the server multiple times and were told they were on the way. We think maybe they got ours by mistake. 50 minutes later (after the other table had eaten and left a while ago) our meal was finally delivered. At that point, everyone else at the table had finished their meals. My husband and I are both vegetarians - he took a bite and got a mouthful of bacon. We sent them back and then had to wait another 15 minutes for our meal and ended up getting them to go. All in all, we waited for a total of 65 minutes for 2 burritos with eggs and potatoes.  We were really hungry at that point, but neither of us liked the burritos, finding them bland. At no time were we offered any compensation for the error and only received one rushed apology - the server said the kitchen was really busy (but as we were the second table there after a 2-top,  our order should have gone in before the rush). As a former server, I was appalled at the lack of customer service and empathy when, not only did we wait a ridiculous amount of time for a simple dish, but the dish was not made correctly and violated our diet. Thank goodness it was not something more serious like a food allergy. I understand that things happen and would have given them 2 stars (they have great coffee) but no one working there seemed to really care. Needless to say, we will not be returning to 32 Shea.

This place is wonderful! My husband and I went today to get massages. He got a swedish and I got a prenatal massage. My therapist, Rick, was very nice and accommodating. He did a wonderful job and I feel great! My husband said his therapist, Tricia, was excellent as well. You cant beat the price at $55 for an hr massage, and they also have military discounts. We will definitely be returning!

Do NOT go to this nail salon.  I have been to other Regal Nails and they have been fine - good prices, so so atmosphere, but worth it for a pretty good pedicure at a good price (19.99).  However, this particular Regal Nails was awful from the beginning. When I went to the desk the woman (the older of the 2 women working that day) was the one who was available. She took me to the chair and when I put my feet in the water was REALLY hot - dont get me wrong I love hot showers, hot tubs, etc but this nearly burned my feet. She then made small talk while doing my pedicure, which really hurt. She was rough and didnt seem to care when I repeatedly winced in pain.   She was chatting with the other woman (who also worked there and was giving someone else a pedicure next to me) most of the time and often just stopped what she was doing with me in order to look at the women and  finish her conversation (at least 5-7 times). Often while holding my foot in the air during the massage, It was very annoying.  When she was done, I wanted to sit for a few minutes to let the polish dry and she nearly threw me out even though no one was waiting. She came over and grabbed my purse and started looking for my wallet to return my card!!!! I took the card from her and told her I would do it. She then grabbed my legs and began rolling down my jeans, to which i again told her I could do it. She grabbed my purse and drink and sandals and tried to shove them on my feet. I grabbed my stuff and left. I was in such a rush to get out of there that I didnt even notice what a shoddy job she had done (I still had some of my old polish on the sides and she had gotten polish on my feet).   Not that this would excuse this behavior but it was the middle of the day, not even close to closing, and as I said no one was waiting.  I will NEVER return to this salon again and hope they improve their service if they hope to remain in business.

I was getting married and looking for a place to get my nails done along with my bridesmaids the night before the wedding. I saw a Groupon for this place and called prior to purchasing to confirm they could fit us all in around the same time. I was told this wouldn't be a problem.  I purchased the Groupon and called to make the appointment and was told there was no way they could fit us all in the night before because they only have 1 nail person after 4pm. This doesnt really make sense to me - not sure why they would cut back on staff once people get off work (this was on a Friday). I told them I had called the day before and they said it must have been a new person who gave me the wrong information. They then told me that some of us would have to book during the day and the other two could come at night. Although this was not ideal and I was not thrilled we made it work.  My bridesmaid called the week before and then the day prior to confirm the appointments and they said we were all set. The day of the appointment, they called one of the girls and told them that they had double booked and couldn't fit her in at all that day. When we got there we told them that this was the second time that this had happened and that we were unable to come tomorrow due to the wedding. They managed to fit her in but seemed unhappy about it.  The first group went during the day and the girls who did our nails all "seemed" nice. Then, the other two bridesmaids came later that night. The nail person was talking trash about us (not realizing the person she was talking trash to was also in the wedding party) saying that it was our fault they double booked and saying how she didnt like the nail colors the bridal party had chosen. My bridesmaid told her she was in the wedding as well and the nail person stopped talking pretty quickly but the damage was done.  The moral of this story: Go here if you want bad service, a good chance of them lying to you and/or screwing up appointments, and then talking trash about you when you leave.

I like this place a lot - my husband and I get $6 groupons and go whenever there is a movie out we want to see. The chairs are really comfortable - although I usually like to sit at the counter seats because sometimes it is hard to see otherwise if someone tall sits in front of you. The food is just ok - usually we eat first - but we love catching movies and a few drinks here! :) Especially for $6 - cant beat it!

I purchased the groupon for a 2 hour basic cleaning. According to the groupon, a basic cleaning includes the following:  "During basic cleanings, a pair of technicians sweep, mop, and vacuum floors, and scrub windows, blinds, and light fixtures. They clean and disinfect the entire bathroom and scour kitchen appliances, including the fridge, oven, and microwave"  I was not at all impressed with the service. The cleaners arrived late and left early. I asked them to clean the main living room, the kitchen, one bedroom and one bathroom. In the kitchen, they did not clean all appliances as stated. They left many spots uncleaned. The oven had sauce on it from when I cooked last night that they never cleaned and the counters were not cleaned well. In the bathroom, the floors were done but still very dirty. The living room and bedroom, the lampshades and the artificial plants were not dusted (as well as the wooden bed frame). The little they did dust was not done well - they did not move things - they just dusted around them. In the kitchen and living room they did not shake out the floor mats (they left one folded on a chair and the other was never moved). When I went to put the one on the chair back where it belonged after they had left it was dirty and made the floor dirty again as it was never brought outside and shaken out.   When I emailed them about the service, they said they would come again for free. I emailed them 3 times and called and it took them over a week to get back to me. When they finally did they said they could schedule something over a month and a half away. I have emailed them back several times since but still have been unable to set anything up. They have HORRIBLE customer service! They take FOREVER to get back to you and when they do they are vague and make it difficult to set something up! When they do show up they do a crappy job.  I will be contacting Groupon immediately advising them to never work with this company again. Go with someone else!

Absolutely delicious! LOVED the ambiance - my husband and I sat on the patio and it was perfect. The service was out of this world and the food... oh the food... if this place wasn't on the pricier side (and rightfully so) I would be here every night! My new favorite restaurant. I don't eat meat and was a little concerned about having something to eat - when I let the server know and asked for recommendations, he told me about a leek and potato ravioli special that was one of the best dishes I've ordered. My husband ordered another special, halibut with squash blossoms, and he loved it! We also had their cornbread and guacamole and a salad to start - both of which were insanely good. We can't wait to go back!

My husband and I had some staining on the bottom of our pool from the previous owner and wanted to get it taken care of. We called Bullfrog and they called back the same day (I called another company that shall remain nameless and they never returned my call). Everyone was super nice and my pool looks great! They were able to accommodate my schedule and were always available. Highly recommend! My pool looks great! If you do go with Bullfrog, use the Yelp deal! :)

I called Bird Dog Plumbing because we were having some problems with two of our toilets and one of our sinks. They came out to the house and looked at all three, telling us that basically we just needed to replace the toilets (they were both older - in the home when we purchased it) and that the sink handle needed to be replaced as well. They told us how to do it and didn't charge us a cent, not even a fee to come out to our home! All three workers were extremely nice and helpful - we will definitely be calling them the next time we need a plumber!

Delicious and healthy food! I love how they use all local ingredients and how their menu changes so often. Our server, Jonathan, was excellent - he was very informative and nice - he checked in regularly but was not overbearing or intrusive in the least. A little pricy but the food was delicious! I will definitely be going back.

Just had my car detailed (got a Groupon) and they did a really nice job. I have to be honest, I was expecting poor quality due to the other reviews on here. However, two people showed up early to my home and took about an hr and a half for my CRV. The car is very clean and looks great! The people were very nice and even helped me as they were leaving to put the antenna on my car (I'm pregnant and they didn't want me to have to climb up, even though it was off when they got here). Bonus - once they come out once they told me they will always honor the groupon price for future detailing! This seems like a smaller company than many, so expect to wait a few weeks to get on the schedule, but I was very impressed with the quality of work and the price and will definitely be using them again!

Best.tacos.ever! Hands down. I found this restaurant on Yelp and had to check it out.   The ambiance is crazy!! It is brightly colored and the decor is based on Mexican wrestling so it is very... unique. I thought it was funny and definitely different... but good different! I loved the Mexican music playing in the background!  The food was incredible. When my husband and I walked in, the people behind the counter asked if we had been there before. When we said no, they told us we could sample all the meat. I dont eat meat, but my husband jumped on the chance. Every one he tried was followed by "oh wow!" or "oh god this is delicious!" etc etc. He ended up getting a beef burrito and I got vegetarian tacos. It is similar to Chipotle in that they make your meal in front of you and you decide what toppings you get. Both of us LOVED our meals - and the guac was delicious! The meal was fast, inexpensive and awesome!   We cant wait to go back! Thanks Yelpers!
