Cook line is slow. Another Yelper said it best. "Good food but run like a kids lemonade stand." Management, you make people wait unnecessarily. Food is good and hot. Try waiting in your own line and you will see what I mean.

Kaibab Animal Hospital in Scottsdale is one of the best. When I needed my dogs fixed, I gave them a try. Dr. Wright and his team made it a simple process, when I came in with my two doxies in tow. The office is very clean, which made me feel good about the health of my pups. After that, Kaibab became our veterinarian of choice. Both doctors educate you about the suggested procedures beforehand - no surprises. We now take our dogs in for routine exams and the normal services that rambunctious wiener dogs need. I love that you can schedule online. I highly recommend this veterinarian for those in Scottsdale, east Phoenix and the east valley.

Always a first class experience when you come to Souvia Tea. The owners are as welcoming as the the tea is delicious. Great atmosphere. This award winning business has a great story. Really enjoyed my experience here.

I ordered a shirt from Brand X pretty much 100% online and submitted my own artwork. They did a very nice job of calling me to confirm my order and talk through exactly what I wanted. They sent me a proof along with my quote and then a second proof after a wanted some minor changes. It's very clear that the staff works as a team and they did a nice job on the shirt that I had produced. The reason for a four and not a five star, --- The website was a little bit clunkier than some of the other T-shirt design websites online, but I wanted to spend my money locally. I wanted to spend my money in Tempe. I would recommend this store.

If you are an entrepreneur and you love small business, you will love Infusionsoft. As one of their original clients, I can say the passion for small business success at this company is unmatched. When I first met the founders in the very early days, they were creating basic databases. They have turned their love for relationship marketing, problem-solving and helping entrepreneurs into one of the fastest-growing and most successful companies in the industry. If you are looking for a CRM with lots of power and features, this one is for you. Some people have and will make negative posts about this sales and marketing CRM platform. Infusionsoft is a bit complicated, and in order to be that powerful -- and if you want to be successful -- you must invest the time and money to attain the success they have assisted thousands of companies reach. They provide top-notch training and small biz conferences like #ICON to get your sales machine off the ground. I give Infusionsoft five stars.

This is one of the most unknown treasures in Phoenix ... And is a wonderful educational experience for children. This well thought out exhibit has extensive hands-on activities to engage kids physically and mentally. Lots of time and money was invested in this exhibit, so be sure and leave a nice donation so AHA can maintain the quality of the experience. Just minutes from Sky Harbor, the Phoenix Zoo, Tempe, and several major freeways... This is not to be missed.

My company, Sonoran Studios, is a member of ASBA. We are an Arizona video and motion graphics production company. The Arizona Small Business Association is an amazing resource for small business owners. We have been a member for over seven years and find ASBA very beneficial to the operation of our business. ASBA holds a number of business expos and training forums that help small business owners grow and improve their businesses. One of the best benefits of becoming a member is the healthcare insurance that you can purchase here. In my dealings with ASBA, the staff has always been very responsive and highly professional at every turn.  On a political front, they watch out for the interests of small businesses at the state capitol. This work is mostly done behind-the-scenes, but is a huge benefit to the bottom line of small business entrepreneurs. I have attended a number of the expos and have always made great connections with high-quality leads and with other business professionals. The membership fees are extremely reasonable compared to similar organizations. I have nothing but praise for ASBA, and would encourage other small business owners to join. -Neil Schneider, CEO

What a gem at the airport! Stopped in and had carnitas, Brussels sprout salad and sangria. I have eaten at the other location, but this one is just as good, if not better -- and at the airport! WOW. My server, Regina, was pleasant and helped keep us moving. Don't hesitate to try Chelsea's at the airport in Phoenix, AZ.

This place was great at first until they decided NOT to clean the equipment. Sweaty equipment for you? Join here. After several requests to staff, I am turning to Yelp. 50% of ellipticals have operational issues too. Staff said they can't find anyone to clean. Oh, but I can find a new gym.

I had posted a complaint about poor equipment cleanliness, but they have definitely improved. For that, I thank management. Keep it up.  Up to 4 stars.

I don't write a lot of reviews so for me to write a review means it was a great experience. I'm not a wine drinker, but I really enjoyed Postino in Tempe. The atmosphere of the restaurant is incredible. The staff was very attentive and the food was great. The service was fast and I can't emphasize enough how friendly the staff was. The prices were fair, especially the five dollar mini pitcher of beer. I will definitely come back.

First time visiting Orange Table today was just before the ASU football game. The staff was able to handle the crowd very well. The food was tasty, I had the corn beef hash and scrambled eggs. I really liked the fresh squeezed orange juice. Our server was courteous and prompt even considering of the place was packed. Will definitely come back and recommend it if you're in Tempe.
