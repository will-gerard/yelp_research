I don't get my nails done a lot. Can't remember the last time I had a manicure. I had a holiday party and realized that I really needed one. Smiley Nails was empty and able to take me right away- I was the only customer.  It was the person that did the manicure that I have an issue with. I did not get her name, I don't know if she told me, and don't remember seeing any tag or sign at her station. She demonstrated the ability to speak English well enough to find out what I wanted but did not speak for the rest of the visit. I don't mind people who are quiet, but she kept making comments over her shoulder to her coworkers in their native language- that is just rude. Also, I had a nasty papercut on my thumb that had just scabbed and stopped hurting. Despite me telling her twice that it was a scab and not dirt, she scraped it off- ouch. I've seen some reviews that were positive but it looks as if it is a specific employee who is getting them. If I had known that, I would have asked for them. I will not be going back. I actually do plan on continuing to get manicures- my nails really did look better, just not there.

I am writing this review specifically for the Doggie Day Camp.  My puppy (8 month old chihuahua mix) needed someone to watch him during the day for a week. We hadn't looked at a day care/camp yet, since there was a family member home at the time.  I was able to find all of the info I needed on the site, and it was easy to print and fill out ahead of time. They needed vaccination records also.  My dog LOVES this place, and the employees. He gets excited every time I walk him near a sliding glass door now, and also wags his tail and goes up to anyone wearing a blue shirt (employee's wear blue). They know him by name and that he is on a limited ingredient diet. They are always as happy to see him as he is to see them. I am biased, since I believe he is the best dog that has ever lived, but the fact that they like him is key. He gets a Pawgress report card every day, which is cute, and it tells me whether he ate, pooped, and how he interacted.  I was worried that he would forget his potty training (they have a room for that, inside) but he did not. We probably could leave him home all the time, but we send him at least once a week because he loves it so much. You don't need a reservation either, once the dog has been there. That is nice when it is a last minute thing.

Fry Bread is really a lot like fried dough, but this restaurant takes it to a whole new level. My favorite is the beef and vegetable stew, but they have tacos and dessert stuff too. All centered around fry bread of course. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable. There is not wait staff. You order and they call your name.The night that I went most recently was a busy night because of a fair that was happening on 7th ave, so the food took about 10 minutes, but usually it's pretty prompt.

Good overall. Only went for color safe shampoo and conditioner, but they have a good variety of hair care products for every type of hair- including treatments for damaged hair and for ppl who spend a lot of time in the pool. Not a huge store but it appeared to have a good selection in general. Staff very polite- asked if I needed help but didn't hover when I said no.

I have only been shocked by amazing customer service at a repair shop one other time in my life, and that was in 1996. Usually when I deal with car repair issues the defenses go up and stay there. The staff at Marshall's has done the impossible- change my mind and prove to me that even though a good shop usually has a full schedule and charges a good chunk of money just to open your hood, there are exceptions and occasionally someone commits a random act of generosity that makes your day. How many people really walk away from a shop, after their new to them car has broken down and been towed, with a smile on their faces? It wasn't my car, it was a friend's, but it was so nice to deal with a business that told the truth, even when it didn't make a profit! We were 35 miles away from home when my friends just over 100,000 mile car, that he'd bought less than a month ago, lost most of it's accelerating power while getting on the 101. We were fairly alarmed and got off the road to check it out. There was not anything that we could see causing the problem and neither of us wanted to be involved in one of those stories that start with- "The car was still moving so I drove it", and end with "if I had just had it towed I wouldn't be shelling out a couple thousand bucks to replace the entire transmission."  The car was towed there at about 3pm and the error code was pointing towards a really expensive tranny repair.  We were bummed, no ride available for at least a few hours, and who has extra money for a car problem, especially after just buying a vehicle? They said they'd get it in and check some stuff out that afternoon, which was great. Even greater? The mechanic came back and told us that he couldn't find anything wrong- he had driven it to make sure. He had called the transmission shop that he uses when he can't  diagnose a complicated problem, and the the error code was one that printed off 4 pages of things to rule out before it would be possible to guess what the actual problem was well enough to fix it.  They said that they would be more than happy to keep the car overnight, send it to the other shop for more diagnostics, and then to bring it back and fix it. Then- something rarely heard in a business that wants to make a profit. There was nothing going on that would prevent the car from making it home, and that it might be more convenient and a whole lot easier to take it back to Glendale and go to the transmission shop that he had been given the name of.  That was so cool, but even cooler to hear- No charge! The prices are clearly listed on the wall behind the counter, and it was $120 just to hook it up and read the code #. They had done that, driven it, called some people that knew more than they did, and then just passed on the info at absolutely no charge. I think we were out of there by 4:30.  I will be purchasing a car soon, and a good shop, with honest staff who don't have a problem consulting another business when it gets more complicated than they feel comfortable with, and who actually cares about the customers enough to just make  sure the car isn't really broken is exactly what I want. Now that I know that one exists, I will make every reasonable effort to get my vehicles there for maintenance, scheduled repairs, and, with a decent AAA membership, unscheduled and highly stressful breakdowns.  I did not know that people still did business this way. They must be doing a lot of good repairs to be able to give completely honest advice that doesn't make them a cent.  There was a vehicle on every lift being fixed, so it wasn't a slow day. This didn't happen because they had nothing better to do. Apparently it's just the way they run the business. Thanks guys! The car is home and the customer is very pleased.

This place has amazing service and I'm still having a hard time believing that anyone would sell glasses at the price I paid, or really, why other places like Lenscrafters can get away with charging so much. I just recently started wearing glasses, and am hard to fit. I have a smaller than average head, and one ear a bit lower. I went to Lenscrafters first and dropped a ton of money. I only had 2 2 sets of frames to choose from because of the size issue. Wire frames, looked ok, kept bending back to original shape, which for me, made them uneven. After getting numerous re fittings done at Lenscrafters I decided I needed something less pliable and found this place through the other Yelp reviews. Excellent service, the staff took some serious time to find the ones that fit- and they had tons! When they gave me the total I asked how much the frames were. She laughed and said I must've been to Lenscrafters. The glasses were $29, she recommended upgrading to antiglare which brought the price up to $79. I was so psyched I ordered a pair of sunglasses too. They took about a week, but were totally worth the $ and the drive. I know I'll end up going back and getting more, with those prices, they can become an interesting accessory and not a painful expense. I saw a family with a bunch of kids- all wore glasses and all I could think was how on earth would these kids get glasses if they had to go to one of the expensive places...

This Michael's is TINY. Probably ok for general craft stuff, but if you need something specific you should probably go to a larger one. I went on a Sat evening to get some cotton yarn for a crochet project. The one brand they had in stock was on sale that day (I know, crappy timing). There were only a few choices left, at a larger location I would've found something.  Unfortunately this store has such a tiny stock to begin with that the stuff there was not enough quantity even if it had been in a color that didn't suck. If you are actually making something specific this location is too small to count on for supplies (at least when it comes to yarn crafts). On the positive side, the layout is better than some of the other craft stores. The staff was helpful- I didn't get what I wanted but someone did go look in the back.  I do like the fact that Michael's has good prices and there is always some kind of yarn on sale. It can really suck you in. Makes me wonder if there are any 12 step programs for compulsive yarn buyers;)

Another yarn store that I get sucked into and can't seem to get out of without supervision. The downside is that the yarn, while great quality is VERY expensive. If you are looking for the highest quality this is you place. They carry all of the blends that are easy to work with, in every type of fiber. The staff is helpful. They have a lot of classes but most are geared toward knitting. Most places dothough, it's trendier thatn crocheting right now. They are pretty comfortable letting me wander around for 2 hours and will ask if they can help me a few times, but don't overdo it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the lack of inexpensive yarn. It's all pricey, none cheap or in between.

I love this place. With ZPizza next door, you can go for dinner and dessert. The Pink Spot is my favorite though, because they have breakfast food, from waffles to huge burritos to every coffee drink under the sun. Also smoothies, chocolate covered frozen bananas, and my favorite- chocolate covered frozen cheesecake on a stick. You can order online and pay with paypal. Any place that can deliver chocolate frozen cheesecake on a stick deserves 5 stars!

Move here and have nothing? This is the best place for stuff like plastic baskets, glass kitchenware like cups, bowls, and the serving stuff. Also all the the small stuff you need for your kitchen and bbathroom. And where else can you get a package of 50 pairs of chopsticks for $1? The products are decent if a bit unfamiliar. Use your own judgement. I wouldn't buy their condoms unless I was ging to use them as ballons....

Don't bother. I had an appointment for an oil change on a Saturday afternoon. The appointment was for 2pm. I booked it several days ahead so that I wouldn't end up sitting in the waiting area for a long time.  When I made it I specified that I would be waiting, they confirmed day before.  I arrived and checked in 1:50pm. At 2:40 I noticed that my car had not even been moved from the place I had parked it. My boyfriend went to ask if they had maybe done it and put it back before we even noticed. They apologized for the wait, and said that it was being done right then, and would be finished in a few minutes. My boyfriend pointed to the car in the lot and asked again if maybe it was finished and they forgot to tell us. Manager- "I don't know what the hell those guys are doing out there." He went and talked to the guys in the garage and they did start it a few minutes later. He did not charge for it, and gave me a coupon for half off of the next one. So I have to give some credit for that. The rest of the experience really made up my mind though. First of all, I know it gets busy and a manager needs to be able to trust that his employees will do their job, but this one was not keeping tabs on the employees and they were NOT doing their jobs. They fix people's brakes for a living.The manager is reporting that they have provided service that had not been started. In the hour I listened to the service managers conversations with the customers that were picking their vehicles up, I heard him tell several customers that he had done more work than they had authorized and charge them up to twice what they had been quoted. It was necessary and required for safety reasons. Same crap has been pulled on me and I know better now. I just don't trust them, to the point where I checked my oil that day to see if it had really been changed. It had been.
