We have driven by this area so many times and we were looking for a restaurant with a patio/outdoor seating and decided to finally stop by Saturday night. It wasn't as busy as we thought it might be since there were many cars parked in the lot. Yes, it's dated inside but we didn't let that stop us and reading the menu before we asked to be seated we thought we'd give it a try . I ordered the puttanesca and the Hubs has spaghetti and meatballs. Pretty safe choices. It took sometime for the water and Sprite my other half ordered as well as the bread basket to come out. When the bread arrived it was only two slices, hmmm and I am a HUGE carb fan. No biggie I can just ask for more. The soft drink was finished and we had a ibt of a wait for the server to come back to check on us to order a refill and bread. It took almost 20 minutes. Then the food came out, oh boy! I've never tried what I ordered and it was ok, it could have used more sauce, i LOVE my pasta to be saucy and this was a bit too dry for me. As for the Hubs he said the sauce was watered down and mediocre and that the meatballs had a strange after taste. Not sure why but he thinks they were frozen, pre-packaged. He also thinks the dish needed more flavor, more herbs maybe?  I felt bad for him because he was really hungry and has been looking for a great Italian place to add to our list of go to eateries. Sadly, he only was able to eat 1/4 of his dish. Mine? I finished it but it could have used something else, more flavor maybe?. I forgot to ask for red pepper flakes as I like heat in my food. There were a few large parties out there with us and when they left the tables weren't cleared away so it was kind grungy feeling being out there near dirty tables. Other diners came in wanting to sit outside but when they pointed out the dirty tables they were taken inside and the dishes still were left uncleared. It really killed the ambiance. The server also brought us someone else's bill. I noticed the total was too high and had to get the sever to correct it. When he brought it back it was still wrong and not cancelled as he said he would do. My other half was getting angry so I had to walk inside to talk to the Host ( I believe he was the son of the owners) to get the correct check. Geez! Needless to say , we won't be back. It's a shame because the menu was promising and the patio was nice for this time of the year but it's not worth it for the mistakes on the billing and the dirty tables. The search continues for a great Italian restaurant . Hopefully with outdoor seating! :)

This evening we re-visited this restaurant with an open mind since out last visit. We were welcomed and seated quickly. Our server let us know what the specials were for tonight and brought our drinks quickly. I ALWAYS have a difficult time choosing when there is Eggplant on the menu and wind up going with something tried and true. Our server told me that the Eggplant Parm was a good choice and very tasty so I ordered it. With extra sauce of course and salad :) My other half ordered the Chicken Parm (but he was torn between that and Salmon) . A bread basket was served as well and it was nice . I love the olive oil and balsamic server on the table! The olive oil surrounds the separate container of balsamic in what appear to be a cluster of grapes.  The weather this evening was nice enough for the patio but since it was windy we opted for indoor seating. Several other diners came in and started to fill the place and our food arrived in a reasonable time. The salad was nicely torn and mixed well with dressing , It wasn't a quick squirt either on the lettuce and was blended in well with the tomato. The fresh pepper was a nice touch. The first thing I noticed was it was the food was hot and the eggplant was sliced thin. I've only ever had it served as a thick slice and this was great. Lightly bread and cooked well. It was VERY tasty and the BEST I've had! YUM! I put some of my extra sauce on it because that's my thing.  My husband was quiet on his end and when asked about his dinner he said it was the greatest he's had in Phoenix so far. The only thing he didn't like was the veggies. Let me tell you they were fresh and steamed and not frozen. We were served large stalks of broccoli and a large slice of carrot and to me that is Heaven, to him, hmm not so much. But on the bright side , MORE for me! :) We don't always have dessert so we passed on the tiramisu . Maybe another time. Both of us believe that we must have come on a bad night the last time we were here. The food was tasty, the server was spot on and the experience was very pleasant. The consensus is that we will return again. So much more to try.  As I mentioned on my previous visit, the menu has quite a bit of choices and a pretty good selection of adult drinks if you want with your meal. Next time we hope t0 make it out to the patio before it gets too hot to enjoy an outdoor meal.

Wow..there has been a  reason why we've not been to Macayo's since we moved  here. The food: Bad. Yes, it's a chain and not authentic . We both ordered the cheese enchiladas. Mine with black beans on the side I found the  the tortillas were hard and stale. Yuck. I thought it was just mine but my husband made the comment so I knew it wasn't me.. The rice was a salty so I used some sour cream to take the edge off. That by the way is a side item, extra cost. It helped. The waitress asked how it was. I spilled the beans and waited for the manager or a remake. Didn't happen.  The drinks: We sat in the bar to wait for our table to be ready. She was overwhelmed and there was a wait..our table was ready before the drinks. Waited and got them to the table. Pricey for a drink in a soda glass not a Margarita glass. No, we didn't have the ones in the mariachi guy's head..lol. So, I caught the manager. Told him about the food and the waitress and how there was no remake , etc. He apologized and took the bill. We got a small discount. Will we be back? The husband has spoken...No. He didn't feel it was worth it even just for drinks. I agree.

My husband and I were out for a movie and dinner Friday night and decided to eat someplace different . Yes, even we get stuck in a rut and we wanted to try our luck here. For a Friday night we were pleasantly surprised that restaurant wasn't jammed packed and with a lengthy wait but we were seated quickly near the bar. Our server offered drinks and we got them in a flash with chips and salsa. The green one was refreshing and very yummy. I had no problem finding vegetarian options, which I find is usually the case when we dine out. I LOVE black beans and was happy these are on the menu. I ordered the Veggie fajitas, I know so "typical" but I was in a playful mood and they sounded so darn good. My other half was perusing the menu and a bit shy to order fish (his favorite by the way) since most places over cook it or serve it plain and dry. Salmon is his to die for food and so it was this evening. We had about a hour or so before our movie and the food arrived quickly so no worries there! My husband dug in rather hesitantly into his fish and I into my aromatic sizzling vegetables. I was munching down when I realized there was no sound coming from across the table. Haha.. he was thoroughly enjoying his fish! He said there was flavor and that the fish was cooked to perfection. Moist and not dry at all. The sauce he said was delicious. Coming from him that is a Gold Award :) We had enough time to finish our margaritas and make it on time to our movie without breaking a sweat. The decor is colorful. There is a central area that reminds you of a courtyard . It was pretty busy there the night we were there and the bar looks very friendly. We see there are lunch specials and the Happy Hour has some tasty looking tapas style offerings so we will definitely be coming back for HH.

Having come from L.A we were used to sit down Chinese restaurants ,not fast food like Panda Express, so we have been dying for some place like Wong's. We have just moved into the area and spotted the restaurant across from Fry's supermarket and decided to go in and look at it before trying it. Yipee! A sit down restaurant, outdated, yes but they actually use tablecloths and napkins. We came back the next evening and we were pleasantly surprised at the offerings. Different types noodles, different protein selections and for me? Different veggie dishes with Tofu that can be added. The hubs ordered Sweet and Sour Pork, Pork Fried rice and a beer and myself Kung Pao veggies with added tofu. All I can say is YUM!  Portions are more than enough for two or three, so we had leftovers for lunch and late night snack. We have since been back several times and tried other dishes and they were just fine. Service has been great, no problems. We are asked if we would like to order something to drink, I prefer water or the hot tea that comes with the meal. The ladies there are very friendly and attentive. Water is refilled literally within seconds of emptying the glass. Now, we have been lucky to get there when it's not terribly busy so the food comes fast. My hubs says he's not sure if its microwaved as others have thought on previous reviews. As for me I think it comes fast because we have been the only ones there or only the second seated table on the premises . Yes, the decor is dated. It could use an update but I think the food is the treat. Hubs says the bathroom is clean, I haven't visited the women's restroom yet. Everything else has been clean and tidy when we have been there. We will be back!  ...more items to try :)

Rawhide Steakhouse was awesome! My daughter was visiting from out of town and we decided to go there  before she left AZ  :) We are so glad we did! :) The 'town" is cheesy but you have to expect that from an "attraction". We thought it was a couple of notches better than Knott's Berry Farm Calico Gold mine area. The Sheriff and company made us laugh and the town was a quick walk through but it is a small venue and we think it would probably be better during the weekend with more folks roaming around. We skipped the wristbands and shopped and explored. It was very nice. The Steakhouse was WOW! It was a rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. Checkered table clothes and gas lamps for lighting on the table. We were seated quickly and must have gotten there at the right time for dinner since 5-10 minutes later lots of people showed up. Our server was quick and brought the salads really fast. Not to self: Skip the salad since the entrees are rather large. I ordered the Veggie platter thinking $13 was a tad expensive for a veggie platter (the only real option for Vegetarians) but it was DELISH! There was LOTS of asparagus on the platter with all kinds of seasonal veg and the veggies were not frozen! My other half ordered a rib eye thinking he would never find a decent piece of steak again and was pleasantly surprised. LOL, I am so used to him turning down steaks due to chewiness and fat and this one he said  had flavor ,was very tender, was seasoned perfectly and cooked as ordered. Best steak he has had in years.  He regrets not ordering the Porterhouse but thought it would disappoint.  It is definitely next on his list to order there! My daughter had the chocolate cake. It was moist, rich and filling. No complaints. We even enjoyed live entertainment! :)  Hubby was extremely pleased when he heard Ghost Riders being played. Yes, we will be back for dinner again, most likely on the weekend.  If you have out of town guests, it might be a bit typical of an attraction, but the people that work there made sure we were all having fun and the food was great. You might want to give it a try! I'm glad it took my special visitor for us to finally stop talking about going there and actually doing it!

I have been to the Rainforest Cafe when they first opened and went back two days ago since my daughter was visiting from out of town. We knew it wouldn't be reasonably priced but what a sticker shock! $66.00 for three people and no appetizers! The place has seen better days. Yes, it was noisy with the "rain" and the "animals". The fish tanks looked nice though. I eat meatless and had the veggie burger with onion rings, my other half had a cheeseburger and fries, my daughter had "rasta pasta". The Rasta she said had a funny oil film on it, and my daughter thought it was part of the sauce so she mixed it in. She said it tasted funny and kind of rancid. My burger was ok but was a bit mushy. The cheeseburger was average. It was all over priced but the bonus from it all is that we all got sick from our meal there! :(   I had a "sour stomach" (read between the lines) until this afternoon and hubby also. I was the worst of us. My daughter had an upset stomach but didn't get what  we were reeling with.. geez! As for waiting for water and drink refills we had the same problem as others had at this location. I was very disappointed and of course we will NEVER be back again. What a shame. If you go, beware!    It was suggested to me when I first did this review to contact customer relations , which I did,and have yet to hear back from anyone there.  Sad.

Awesome meal, location and atmosphere. This was my birthday experience and I was looking  for some place new and boy was I not disappointed. My other half and I were pleasantly surprised with set tables  outside the main door and the rotisserie grill.  We didn't have a wait and that was a plus for the Mr.  On the patio I felt very comfortable since there are heaters and one huge, gorgeous fireplace! :) I chose this restaurant because of reviews and the food  selection for my other half. Me? Not quite as selective but I found two meatless meals. I chose the veg burger and he chose salmon and the deviled eggs app. Yum for the eggs. Tastey and lots of egg yolk goodness . The Veg burger is made in house and you can't go wrong with that. I usually request mustard or sauce but in this case I didn't need any. A bit messy but that happens with a fresh , house made veg burger. No complaints here. Oh, and the fries? Heaven. Not salty, not spicey but they had a wonderful seasoning on them I loved.  Hubby did too since I decided  to share. His salmon was  moist  and tender. He is NOT a vegetable eater so the cabbage and baby potatoes were pushed aside. (sigh) This evening we didn't partake of any alcoholic beverages but they offer many selections. And dessert? While there was something I might have tried, sadly, I was too full . YES, we will be back. I want to try the veg tacos and we saw lots of good looking food being served that needs to be explored. Parking: Small parking lot but they offer complimentary valet. Definitely a must try for Brunch :)

Another wonderful time here.  We stopped by after having dinner  somewhere  else. My other half kept dreaming of Chelsea's Kitchen and gazing over here as we ate our meal so I suggested a drink or two and maybe dessert here and we stopped by.So glad we did. We sat at the bar on the patio ( which is sooooo relaxing) and the bartender helped us.She was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. Too bad I was somewhat full ,but I still ordered  the red velvet cake with Gelato and it was yummy. We shared the cake. And between me eating the cake and my other half enjoying the frosting we finished it. Come for dessert...a nightcap or the full meal here and you won't be disappointed. I'm a fan of this patio!

We've been coming here since we moved to Phoenix and it was great. Never had any problems with the food , or service or the restaurant. Mind you, we've been here weekends and week days. Busy or slow time and no issues. I have enjoyed "brunch" time on Sunday's sitting on the patio sipping a mimosa and eating Huevos Ranchero. But this past year the quality has just seemed to have gone down. The food is not as tasty as it used to be , the quality seems as if they have changed suppliers to save on cost since the textures on some of our choices has been a bit off. Two months or so we went in for dinner and the enchiladas just seemed like the cheese was thrown in and microwaved. The spicy "Mexican" flavors were non existent. And my husband kept pointing out the lack of cleanliness inside as well. The decorations are dusty and there were cobwebs! Ouch! Last night we went in and there was just no flavor and the tortillas for the enchiladas tasted old :( There are other places to try.  I'm still looking that great Mexican food!

My first time to Mimi's...I wanted to love this place but can honestly say I was disappointed.  So granted, it's Super Bowl week and all, this location wasn't busy. A plus so far. I ordered  Quiche Florentine and the Hubs ordered sautéed sole and artichoke frites. The frites..oh em gee! They remind me of chicken nuggets minus the meat of course. I love them! Now the not so good. The wait. Mind you it was nearly empty  and we waited 45 minutes for our meal.Too long .  We almost left but the bread basket and our appetizer curbed the appetite and we made it stretch. My quiche was good, cooked well. The hubs fish wasn't  really sautéed , it was mushy to even be thought of as sautéed.  He finished it tho.  The saving grace was the artichoke frites..yum. I want to like this place, really. I want to come back because it's inviting and on Sunday's they have brunch and lots of people waiting to get in. I might convince my man to come back. They have more fish for him to try and fish soup. I can't spell it but will find that pesky word later. The service was spotty. Had to ask for refills on our drinks quite a bit. :(

I moved from CA to AZ and was looking for someplace to cut and color my hair and my husband get his cut and we found Salon Vega while shopping at Home Depot (the old location) on Dysart. Julie was awesome! She asked me what I was looking for, helped me with great ideas and took care of my husband and myself. She really made me feel comfortable and my husband was very relaxed having his hair done where there was lots of women. :) We have ALWAYS been been helped without an appointment as well as with one. Violet is great too...ANYTIME we have had out hair done by someone new they always make us feel great AND look great too! The new location is easy to get too also.

I recently decided to have my hair color changed and although I asked for Julie I was told she might be in but not sure. I asked for a call if she wasn't and would wait later so my phone number was taken. Sadly she wasn't in and I needed the color badly (roots showing, very bad) I said all right to Olga. I wanted to go back to blonde but was told not a good idea with my color and gray on there. So between the long and short of it and her boss they told me they could only go light but highlights would help (extra charge of course). My other half was there and not happy and when it was all said it and done I have light brown hair with BLONDE highlights. Why couldn't they make the whole color the blonde???? Hmmmm.... To say that I was not happy is an understatement :(  And don't even ask what my husband has to say about this .... Sad , because I liked this place.

My other half and I were heading over to our bank in this area and noticed a sign about car buying from AAA and realized there was an office there! WOW! My hubs needed to get his disabled license plate taken care of and was dreading going to the MVD so we thought we'd check and see if they offer this service and lo and behold they did! Boy, you should have seen the relief and huge smile on his face as it was taken care of! We waited less then 10 minutes to be helped and the woman who got the job done us was very friendly and fast! Thank You for being there AAA and so close to home.  We will be back soon for travel needs!

So where to start ... Well, I just got off work and the Hubs and I decided we wanted to grab something to drink and maybe some breakfast so we by passed our usual spot and drove here since we are new to the neighborhood and this one is near our home. First of all the place was dirty. Dirty tables, trash on the carpet and not many people inside. Since I wanted to wash my hands I found the ladies room and WOWSA!  It was filthy , no toilet paper and soap. I sure hope the help has their own place to wash up before they cook and serve the customers! While we were seated all I could hear was the servers complaining about who was leaving and breaks.  We heard someone come in after us and loudly announce " Is this the best you can do?"  when he was seated. They placed him by some shady people. Even we were seated by the table where they fold napkins by there was other booths open.  We finally had our order taken and the food came out quickly and was decent BUT we wanted a refill on the coffee.  I had a pleasant conversation with my Mr. and he finally had enough so we got up to leave. Here comes the best part. We walked to the cashier , she asks rudely for the check. We told her we never got one and that we waited for it and refills but got neither. She ignored it and asked for the table we sat at. Obviously she doesn't care about customers and what they have to say. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and asked if there was manager and all she could say was $14.52. That was the total for our bill. I asked again and without even looking at me ,reaching her hand out for our payment she finally told me there isn't one. Not until 6am. So needless to say I told her I guess you don't care about customer service. She didn't bat an eyelash. We will not be back. Even if this is in my neighborhood we won't give it the time of day. I will choose someplace else that is more pleasant and cares about how their customers are treated and welcomes them back. Very disappointed. Don't bother with this location. Try anyplace else. I give it  ZERO rating but it won't let me choose that.

We've driven by this restaurant a few times and found it inviting that the Hubs and I decided to stop in this evening for dinner. I have to say this place has that industrial look and the vibe is kinda cool. While I did read other reviews and checked the menu on their website I thought this place would be nice. Wood fired pizza? 'nuff said. The server was very pleasant and clued us into what the restaurant was about and the specials. Happy Hour is all day Sunday- awesome! :) Sangria for us both. My other half didn't care for it so he ordered a domestic beer and was much happier. Food: We shared the Zucca chips and you MUST try them for an app. The Simple Salad was anything but. It had all kinds of  tasty bits on the plate, Greens, grape tomato, toasted pine nuts, Gorgonzola and a  vinaigrette.  I have to look for meatless options and there are a few.  I asked and you can request meatless sauce for the pastas. So I ordered the Spaghetti and loved it. Yes, I know kinda a "meh" moment but the noodles were actually thick ,which I loved and found to be al dente and quite filling, The sauce is tasty and you can see the tomato in it.  Ha, I didn't request red chile flakes . I normally do that if the pasta or sauce is lacking flavor. Not this time! The menu says they hand make their own  pasta too. Now for the Hubs: He ordered Salmon. His complaint was that it was to be grilled and he found it dry and hard as if it was frozen then grilled. And it was a small serving size. No flakiness or ease of cutting with the fork.  I looked at it (mind you I don't eat meat) sadly I have to agree . Oh, yes, and it comes with spinach and a grain that was similar to couscous with mushroom in it . I asked for the name but forgot it :(  My mister is NOT a veg eater nor does he eat the "fluff" as he calls it that comes with the protein, so I nibbled on it and found it chewy, and nice. It was still a no go for him tho' (sigh) We sat on the patio, which I thought was fine because of the fireplace. My other half thought it was a bit noisy since it sits on the street and we could hear literally hear the conversations from the tables around us rather clearly.   The gas fireplace was nice but they turned it off for some reason. The bar looks like a fun place to sit and enjoy. If my other half was to rate this restaurant it would be a 2, me? I say a 2.5 since  will split the difference with him (from a 3) .  Will we be back? Probably not since he wasn't happy with his selection. The way it was cooked and the portion size for the price.

This evening my other half and I returned to North in Arcadia. I had spoken with Chris, the manager about my experience and since he was eager for us to return and my Hubs was willing to try another meal here ,we came in. We were seated promptly. Inside for this occasion and I wasn't disappointed. Why? Because we were close to the kitchen and I could see them actually slicing meat for the Board appetizers as well as fresh pasta being assembled for cooking. There was a hand pasta roller so I can only assume I missed them actually making the noodles :(  The Zucca chips.. AWESOME! My hubs actually told me that this would be the only time he enjoyed eating a vegetable. Ok, so they are fried  but oh so delicious! Mm mm... Mmmmmm. I decided to try the Margherita pizza since  I sawit being served  the last time we were here and salad. I did not regret it!  It was wood fired and had some "burned" spots but that is what I LOVE! Just ask my man and he will tell you that when he's ready to throw out the burned BBQ I demand it. Sorry,but that is the best part and so it was here. Although that wasn't really burned pizza, it was the tastiest part. :) And the Hubs? He ordered the Rosemary chicken that included roasted vegetables and au jus. He was absolutely delighted with his selection (ok, minus the veggies. Ask and you will be told they are against his religion. LOL).  His only wish was for more au jus. I tried  a piece of the charred broccoli and for me, perfection! I love charred food . So much so that  I might ask for these next time we visit. Chris even stopped by to see how we were enjoying ourselves and we appreciated it. Will we be back? I think so.  Parking is easy since there is complimentary valet parking. The indoor seating was fine.  We've been on the patio and would probably ask for a location near the windows or the shrubbery since the corner seating was a bit noisy for the Mister . The bar looks fun. There was a few people that rode in on bicycles and were seated there. From what I saw they were having a grand ol' time. Service was fast,food was hot and drinks were cold.

Tonight we dined here for the first time and we were not disappointed.  FINALLY some place that serves really fresh and wonderful tasting food :) I had the falafel wrap combo with pita chips and hummus. I loved the flavors from the fresh greens and the hot falafels. For me, I need more of the sauce because I like my wraps a bit on the wet side. I wound up eating it all , no leftovers :(  My other half had the Shish Kabob platter with chicken and beef. Although he is not a fan of poultry  he found the chicken well seasoned, juicy and the marinade to be awesome. And the rice... he's not a carb fan but loved it!  We found everyone behind the counter very pleasant, helpful and cheerful. Lots of interesting food items that I need to try for sure! As one reviewer said "Skip the burger and Go Greek"! .....  Well, at least once and you won't regret it. We're just sorry we haven't been in before now but we definitely  will be back.. again .. and again! Thank You Pita Kitchen!!

My other half saw a commercial for Tres Amigos around Christmas Time and has been dying to go. We made it last month and again today... I must say they have gorgeous furniture and just our style. We love the Mexican Rustic look and found many pieces we would love to own as well as decorations. The employees greet you when you walk in and ask if they can help you right away but they don't hound you like other places do. We shopped and purchased some beautiful items. There are also items for your yard or patio and really cool ceramic pieces as well. Definitely will be back.. again and again!

We  moved into our new home almost 6 weeks ago and the pool was a hot mess! I wouldn't even touch it, bleh! My husband tried some chemicals and it was a bit better but still no where near where it should have been to my liking. He tried several pool supply companies and lots of advice . We had a problem with the filter so we were referred to Michael and Affinity . The filter needed some work and he got it going. Helped with turning the pool water from green to crystal clear and now I can say that I was able to enjoy it this past weekend! Michael fit us into his schedule and worked with my other half to get the pool ship shape .  My hubs is extremely happy that we found Affinity and Michael and that this season will be great by the pool. Thank You for great service!

LOVE this location! We always make it a point to see movies here since they have the leather, reclining chairs in all the theaters at this locale. I haven't had to wait but maybe 2 minutes in line to purchase my tickets. The concession stand serves the standard movie fare but it's been ok so far. No complaints. My other half LOVES the coke machine even though he doesn't make any changes to his standard selection of Dr. Pepper at least he knows he can tweak the flavor if he wants. LOL.. of course I had to show him how to work it and he still forgets what button to select :) The only draw back is that sometimes I wish I had brought a blanket because the seats are so comfy.  Only once did we have an issue getting the handicap seats for the Hubs but the manager apologized and offered us another showing.  YES, please try this location. Once you get used to the seats there the other guys don't even compare.And the employees are pretty friendly. Tip: Remember to use the larger bathroom area in the middle of this location since the one at the front only has a few stalls.
