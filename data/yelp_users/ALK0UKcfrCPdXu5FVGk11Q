Nice place to relax by the lake, sip a great hot or iced coffee and enjoy some terrific cheesecake while reading a good book or doing some work on the laptop.

Recommend the beef head and tongue. The lamb taco is really two so well worth it. Very authentic and if you are looking for real authentic Mexican tacos then this is the place!

Service was excellent and food was great too. Pricing was decent but seating is limited so first come first served.

Great service and excellent place to get breakfast. The eggs Benedict were made perfect! You won't be disappointed by their omelettes either

Service was just ok, better than the last time. Ordered a burger medium well, got a Rare burger! Way over priced mediocre food. Drinks were good once we got them.
