What a great place to take the kids for a fun day!  Camel rides, petting zoo, great play areas.  It's not the San Diego Zoo, but it's not to shabby...

I enjoy the Springs Rolls and the Pho soup.  The decor is nothing to write home about, but the food is pretty decent.

Having some sushi at Temari in Gilbert.  Sake is the owner, has a binder with new creations he thinks of on a daily basis.  I would highly recommend this place for great Sushi!!!!

I've been to Liberty Market several times now.  Good food, lines can be long, outside seating is pretty nice especially during the cooler months.  I would highly recommend this place.

Went there for a kids birthday party.  Had a fun time, plenty of things to do for the kids, nice play areas, fun mini-train to ride around the park!  I would recommend to others that have kids!

Ran in for a quick lunch, had the cheese burger special.  Good food at a fair price, bartender (Stephanie) is a great gal.  I've always had a good time!

Ok, how can it get any better?  Hanging out in a Suite, free beer, food and of course a Suns win, didn't look that way early in the game but the Suns came thru in the 2nd half of the game.  Go Suns!

I use to frequent this establishment a couple of times a week for a Breakfast Burrito, however, on one of my visits the gal behind the counter seemed to have pink eye.  It's rare that I will go there now...

Stopped in for a quick lunch, Taco special.  Good stuff!  Also picked up some beef to grill.  The prices for the groceries are pretty decent.

I love this place!  Visit at least once a week for the #2 combo w/peper jack cheese to give it just a little kick.  The employee's are always very polite and the restaurant is always clean.

The service today really was disappointing and slow.  They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties.  It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order.  Funny thing I was the only person in line.  Normally, we never have any issues with this location.

It was my first time to the Children's Museum, the kids had a blast and were wiped out afterwords... I would recommend Museum to other folks w/kids!

My first time at Pho Van in Chandler.  Had a order of the springs rolls and a nice bowl of pho soup.  The restaurant was clean and the service with good.  I would highly recommend this place to others.  I normally visit Saigon Pho in Chandler, however the quality of food has gone down hill lately.  This is now my fav Pho restaurant!

I placed an order online for curb side pick up service.  When I got home we found some items missing...  For a company that has a pretty detailed online ordering system, this was such a let down.  To top it off, this wasn't the first time I have run into missing items or the wrong order.  I'm a firm believer of giving a second chance, but come on guys... Let's at least try to match the good service you receive inside the restaurant.  Not a good experience mate!

We enjoy going to this theater and the folks are always friendly and provide great service!  We have always had a great experience and enjoy going to this location.  Would recommend purchasing a loyalty cup to keep your cost down.

I have used Donaldson Watch & Repar a couple of times now for my TAG watch repair/service.  They have been very easy to deal with and do a professional job!  I would recommend this place if you need any work done on your watches, etc.  They also sell watches that there store.

Recently had an appt with Dr Jonathan E Wold @ San Tan Eyecare, the visit went very well.  Not that long of a wait, great service by everyone that I met.  I would recommend Dr Wold & San Tan Eyecare if you are looking for an optometrist in the Gilbert area.

Ordered chicken wings along with our pizza, I guess that gal up front didn't know that there fryer wasn't working... needless to say didn't get the wings... oh well.  The kids had fun, except for that one game that took our coins and didn't deliver the opportunity to play... did get a refund... will not be visiting this location anytime soon...

Come on guys, we recently received a deliver menu for this location.  We called to place a take out order.  Many items are no longer offered, no Greek fries,  etc.  why send out a flyer that is not correct.  The sandwiches were all bread, I was very disappointed about the quality of food and menu.  We will not be going back!  Stay clear of this place.
