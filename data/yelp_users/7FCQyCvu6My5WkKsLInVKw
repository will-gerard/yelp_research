I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink. Nothing was fresh, everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work.

These guys are so helpful and kind. They will never rip you off. I went in to change a headlight and one of the owners recognized that my ABS sensor had started to fail (this is common in prius'). Since he owns a (gen 1) prius himself, he was familiar with the problem. I had gone to the dealership previously and they quoted something like $3000 to fix the sensor. At Precision Imports they found me a slightly used sensor and installed it, all for $800. I appreciated that he fixed my headlamp and helped me to fix another issue that I hadn't even asked about, all while saving me some cash.   This place is crazy busy though, it's always hard to find a parking spot, but you know that business is good if the lot is full.

Oh my goodness, I got the very best service here. I had a beat up antique sofa and loveseat set reupholstered, the wood refinished, and the foam replaced. My sofas are MAGNIFICENT right now and they were completed in a reasonable amount of time. I am never ever getting rid of them. These are so beautiful that I will pass them down to my children! I got great advice from the very beginning on how I could make it affordable to have my sofas redone (I am a teacher, in AZ so you know I'm just above the poverty line). Rick was great at suggesting fabrics and finishes and let me bring the sofas in myself to save on delivery charges. I had them deliver the couches at the end so there would be no way for me to mess them up. They arrived on time, exactly when they said they would. I could not be happier with how my sofas turned out.

I heard so much about this place and thought I was about to have the experience of a lifetime. I had cheese enchiladas and took home a dozen tortillas. I wasn't impressed by either. The enchiladas were bland and the cheese looked like store bought shredded cheddar (it wasn't even elted all the way). The tortillas were pretty dry even though they were still warm when I bought them. I won't be going back.

I love this airport.   My family is in California and I fly a lot for business so I spend a lot of time here. I love the volunteer ambassadors in purple, I love the free wifi, I love all the art throughout the terminal and the art gallery in terminal 4. I haven't tried out the new restaurants yet but I love that they brought in some local favorites instead of chain restaurants. Barrio Cafe and Le Grande Orange are the most recent but I believe Humble Pie will also have a location in the airport soon. The security line is generally  busy but moves fast. I am very happy that PHX is a TSA Pre location, that will speed up the security lines even more.

I am originally from New York so I was skeptical at first but the bagels are amazing, better than any I've tried in Arizona. Truthfully, I've only visited once, but when I arrived at 11:30am on Monday morning the sesame bagels were just coming out of the oven. I had one with lox cream cheese and an americano. The cream cheese is thinner than I expected but still delicious. The whole meal was just like I remembered from home.  I also loved how they were playing Cyndi Lauper's greatest hits as I ate. I forgot how positive all of her music is. The location is small, and in a mini mall near Sprouts, Sally's, and the Goodwill. A nice little mom and pop shop with excellent bagels.  update: I've been back several times and it's still delicious. I haven't caught the fresh bagels again, but I now know that they have vanilla soy milk available for your coffee. So if you're lactose intolerant, REJOICE! You can enjoy a regular old coffee with cream in it without an upcharge (I never understood why other coffee shops charge extra for soy milk anyways).

Va Dang is pretty darn delicious. I prefer Pho Thanh, but thats my taste. I like the broth better at Pho Thanh, however Va Dang has way better deserts available.

These are not east coast bagels, but they are pretty darn good for Phoenix. Plus the prices are easy on the wallet and the lox & cream cheese are fresh. They have lots of bagels to choose from and the people that work there are super friendly and helpful.

We arrived on a Friday night at 6:30 with no reservations. We got a drink at the bar while we waited 35 minutes for our table. This place has a beautiful interior, a lovely patio with trees and heaters, and quick attentive service.   Now that I've got the good stuff out of the way, I thought the food was bland and overpriced. I paid $18 for a tasteless serving of short rib tacos. The meat was tender and juicy but had no flavor *at all*. I did enjoy the small kale salad on the side of the plate and the fresh corn tortillas were amazing but the main part of the dish was pretty boring for how much I paid for it. My dining partner had a cheeseburger, which was pretty good in comparison, but those are pretty hard to mess up, but for $13 it could have been better also.   Another reviewer mentioned the lack of people of color. I noticed that too about this place but I feel that way about a lot of Phoenix establishments, it's a remnant of the enforced segregation in Phoenix that ended not too long ago. All in all I was not impressed and I would not go back.

Carly's is a mainstay of the downtown area. Carly's was here and popular among the locals way before this recent downtown Phoenix renaissance. They have a full bar, are open late, and have live music most nights. It's a cozy spot to have a snack and a drink, or to meet friends. You won't have a phenomenal mind-blowing dinner here, but you won't be disappointed either. It's a reasonably priced soup, salad, and sandwich type of place. I personally always get the nicoise salad and sometimes the nutella croissant for desert. I probably go here once a month because it's such an important part of this neighborhood and because this establishment supports local artists by allowing them to perform their music and hang their art here.

I have been coming here for years and I love this place. Literally everything on the menu is delicious. Although to be honest, I have only tried their pasties and their deserts. I know that they serve salads, I just think that is a waste of a meal, and i can make a pretty excellent salad at home. I switch between the vegetarian and the meaty versions fo their pasties and they are both delicious. So vegetarians, have no fear.   The drink specials are very nice as well. I like to get the enormous mug/pitcher of hard cider with my meal. SO GOOD!  I was very happy when they expanded. Sometimes it could be hard to get a table. I'm looking forward to them opening up the patio. I am not sure if that is complete yet.

super fast, super friendly, super healthy.   My favorite drink is the "buzzkill." It's not on the menu but it's a breakfast buzz without the espresso. I love that they have a drive thru!

I am very sensitive to strangers being in my personal space. I rarely go to the doctor, I don't get mani/pedis and I only deal with one hair dresser. So when I needed to see a chiropractor I was nervous. Not only did Dr Majidi make me feel incredibly comfortable, but he solved my back issues! I have scoliosis and I sit at a desk all day and so I have a lot of neck and back pain. I know I should probably visit him once a week, but even with my once a month to once a season visits, the effects are immediate and long lasting. I've been his patient for about 3 years now and I love going into his practice.

I love this place. I have been coming here for many years, mainly for the Saturday night Solstice party, but sometimes also for the other nights as the offerings have expanded. I really love the upstairs balcony dancefloor because you can dance under the stars and sometimes even the full moon.   The crowd (in general) is very welcoming and unpretentious. Most people come to dance and enjoy the music. You can dress up if you want to or you can just kick it. This is one of the few places that I am comfortable, as a woman, going to by myself. I don't have to worry about being groped or harassed. It might happen, but the security crew in here is on point and very protective of their (well-behaved) patrons. The drinks are well-poured and well-priced. I love the heavy-handed bartenders!  The owners of this bar expanded and own some of the surrounding properties, so they now offer even more musical choices, though BarSmith is still the epicenter. There's salsa, banda, house, techno, tech-house, hip-hop, grime, dub-step, progressive, minimal, ...even jungle and DnB at one point... I mean I can't even list them all. Plus things change, different people will run different weeklies at different times. This bar is an institution for downtown Phoenix. I remember when it was literally the only place to go. Even with new spots opening up this is still a stong hold for good music.  The parties and the type of music played here can be kind of seasonal, with the exception of Saturday nights, which is the night that started it all, and kind of the foundation that the bar rests on. Saturday night upstairs is based in deep house but genres are so fluid, so upstairs has a healthy mix of deep-house-related music. On Saturdays the downstairs is a really solid hip-hop night too. It's nice to go between the two floors, they complement each other, like wasabi for your sushi. I could go on forever about this place!

This place put the dirt in dirtbag. I hate saying bad things about a place but this bar captures all of the bad things about Tijuana (not Mexico, but the complicated border town with high crime and low American morals). The drinks are OK. This place caters to a younger uncultured crowd. I think I was just too old to be there and I'm in my mid thirties.

Just ate here with my boyfriend and I was very impressed. We did not make reservations but it was a Sunday night and I didn't really take the reservation thing seriously. I would imagine that it might get busy on a Friday or Saturday night and require reservations though, because the place is not huge. Not small either, but very cosy.  We both ordered the "whole meal" thalis. My boyfriend had the maharaja (all meat) and I had the combo with dal, chick peas, and chicken curry. The biryani that came with the food was the best I have ever had. I would go there just to eat the biryani alone. The naan was top notch too. Everything was delicious. I was really surprised for Arizona.  The thalis also come with chai and desert. They were very accomodating when I forgot that chai is brewed with whole milk (I'm lactose intolerant) and they traded mine out for a delicious dark tea.  The service was a little slow, but still great. The restaurant was almost full while we were there but it was never too noisy. The modern Indian music was a nice touch too.

I love this spot. It is my most favorite pho spot, possibly in the entire US, definitely in Phoenix. The service is terrible, but I expected that. I think only culturally American spots would even consider service an important quality in a good restaurant. This place focuses on the food. It's all about the delicious (and surprisingly inexpensive) food.

I just got back from my first wax at EWC. The front desk was very nice, everyone was very nice. I really liked my waxer as a person, but she was not very thorough.   It was my first time there, but I had been going to another waxing spot. Even though your first "bikini line" wax is free, I paid a little extra to get a "full wax" (+$16) and the "inner thigh" (+15). Despite getting these add ons, I still had a lot of hair left over and A LOT of wax. So much so, that I thought about using Nair when I got home. I didn't b/c I know that I'd be hyper sensitive right now, but I really wanted to since there was so much hair left over.   I know that each esthetician is different, so I am going to give them one more chance with another esthetician, but I was disappointed. I did like the use of the different gels to reduce ingrown hairs and such and will report back later if they actually work.

The service was friendly but abysmally slow. There were a lot of people working and for the size, the place was pretty empty, but they were generally disorganized. It took us over 2 hours total to have a 'quick' breakfast.  I had huevos rancheros and the tortilla was either old or overcooked, it was so hard. The beans were well flavored.  My friend had the biscuits and gravy and said they were good.  We were staying at the hotel behind the restaurant, so the location was incredibly convenient, but I wouldn't go to this restaurant again. There are too many other choices close by.

This is a great coffee shop and a great center point for the neighborhood. At first I had my reservations about the place because I loved HoodRide that occupied the building before, but after so many years, I see how this establishment has made a huge contribution to the growth of the downtown community. I love that they are open 24 hours. I have stopped here after a hearty night out (and before driving home) on more than one occasion.  This place has the very best chai that I can find in AZ, maybe even the best chai that I've ever had (outside of just about any Indian household). I respect that they make their own chai blend. You can see the bits of tea and ginger at the bottom of your cup. It is flavorful and delicious. Otherwise, the turkey, jam, and cheese crepe is my favorite (#9?), but I also order the veggie omelet and the sweet crepes from time to time.  I haven't been in for brunch in a while, but when I lived downtown, I remember them having delicious specials that are not on the regular menu on the weekends.

I'm a huge fan of the food. The bar itself is a little too rowdy for me, but I'm not into sports bars. I had the slam dunk shrimp and I am smitten, who thought to put buffalo wing sauce on tempura shrimp?!?!? It's out of this world. I also got a kids quesadilla with fries and it was ok. The shrimp were the real superstars. As a vegetarian, I will definitely be back for these guys.

I went here to get a french bikini wax by Jewell. She was super sweet and very professional, thorough, and FAST! Today was the first time I have been seen by her and I was so impressed that I bought a 3-pack of waxes! I definitely want to see her again.

I love the food here and it's pretty much one of 3 vegan/vegetarian spots in Phoenix but the service is UNBELIEVABLY slow. I don't even walk in the door if there is a line. Even with no line it took about 20 minutes to get an acai bowl on a Wednesday at 10:40am. Don't ever come here if you're in a hurry, but it's a lovely place to sit and chat a whole morning away with a friend.

I meant to write a review sooner, but got busy with work. I got the best service here. I was kind of blown away.  My bf got my windows tinted here for me but got them tinted too light. I called back and they were more than willing to help me re-tint the windows on my Prius (even the tiny triangular ones) and even offered me a discount on the re-tint even though my bf chose the lighter shade himself. When I arrived Chris talked me through my options and he tinted all of my windows a darker shade. He even lent me his car while I waited for the tinting to be done (~4hours). On top of it all, we talked about how I was tired of the political bumper stickers from 2008 & 2012 that I still had on my car and how I couldn't get them off myself. When I came back for my car he had taken them off for me. How sweet of him! Of course I tipped him.  These guys are super polite and they know about tinting. They do a great job and go above and beyond to give you great customer service.

Just delicious.  I had the veggie combo which was way too much food for one person, and I took more than half of the plate home. The restaurant was pretty empty when I arrived at noon on a Wednesday. The service was slow but not as bad as the other reviews describe. I probably waited 5 minutes to place my order after I closed my menu, then my order came out about 10 minutes later. It was during the winter holidays so 2 young boys who called the chef, "mommy" were being cute off in the corner. I will definitely be coming back often.

Oh so yummy.   My boyfriend and I came in with our two dogs after hiking around Papago Park. We had the patio to ourselves when we first arrived, and this gave my dogs time to get used to the atmosphere. We happened to get there during happy hour and got caprese salad and humus nachos off of the happy hour menu. The humus was really flavorful but I expected something different with the name "nachos." It was essentially humus scoops on pita wedges drizzled with balsamic vinegar with a few pomegranate seeds and diced red onion for decoration. It was delicious, but not so much "nachos." I expected more toppings. The mozzarella in the caprese salad was also tasty, it seemed very fresh possibly even locally made. For the main event I ordered the brie hive and my boo got the sriracha burger. My Brie hive was exactly what I was looking for. The combination of toasted sourdough bread, warm brie, crisp apples, prosciutto, and arugula(?) was spectacular. I would definitely come back for that sandwich. My love really enjoyed his burger and it smelled great and looked so very juicy from where I sat. For our sides I got the regular fries and he got the greek salad. Both sides were good enough but the sandwiches were really the stars of the show.  I also want to say that they were very welcoming to our two dogs. The chef brought them pepperoni dog treats to munch on and our waiter brought them a bowl of water. I thought that was very thoughtful of them and showed that they truly love animals. I really appreciated that added kindness.  When the restaurant started to get busy around 6pm we decided to leave. Our dogs were getting skittish with all of the people. I would definitely come back and next time try out some of their craft cocktails and their smores.  Just one small negative, they are right on University and that can give off some traffic sounds. There is also a low hum coming from the big power grid across the street, but you can only hear these clearly if no music is playing and you are sitting outside on the patio.

I've only been here once but my first impression was very good. I heard that there was a patio and that the place was dog friendly so I brought my two poodle/terrier mixes. I sat in the patio and ordered inside. My dogs were pretty calm in that space even though it is right on university. There is astro turf through the entirety of the patio area with various types of seating.  I enjoyed the kale cleanse and tri-tip protein plate that ordered. Everything came out pretty fast with the exception of my drink, which lagged behind other people who ordered after me. Oh well. When it arrived it was DELICIOUS. I can't wait to try their other drinks.  I visited on a Sunday. There were a good amount of people there hanging out but I wouldn't say that the place was busy. There is also a huge chessboard and shuffle board(???) to play out on the patio. It looks like a nice place to hang out, but I wonder how crazy it gets during the week when all the students are around. I'd definitely go back during the weekends and during the breaks, as it seems like a really chill space.

I've heard lots of good things about this FOOD TRUCK.   The day I checked them out they were not serving the blackened fish tacos that everyone raves about. I am pescaterian, so my only other choice was the veggie stir fry. It was pretty terrible. Though the veggies were fresh, it was almost ALL bean sprouts with just a few squash, carrots, red peppers, and about 3 tiny pieces of kale. Veggies are pretty cheap, so I expected more for a $10 plate. The rice was really old and hard :( I wish they had a rice cooker in the truck to keep the rice fresh and chewy. The window person was REALLY nice, so they at least have great customer service. If I try them again, I definitely won't get the stir fry.

oh my. I just came from my first meal at this place and I can't believe how delicious everything was. I really was expecting run of the mill Chinese food (I didn't exactly know what Taiwanese food is like) but I got so much more. I ordered the hand shaved noodles, pan fried with mixed veggies and my beau got the 3-cup chicken. Holy crap! I think we might have ordered the two best dishes on the menu. With each bite my eyes would grow wide and I would hum a little to myself, it was that delicious.  The pan fried noodles were garlicky and delicious. The noodles were thick and chewy, exactly how I like them. It's like each noodle almost has the consistency of meat. It was yummy and filling. The veggies were bok choy, bean sprouts, carrots, and green onions. There was also egg.  The 3-cup chicken had the best flavor! It was a ginger/teriyaki (?) sauce and the chicken was cooked just right. Tender in the right places and crispy in the right places. I believe leaving the chicken on the bone also lent to the delicious flavor.  We ordered two taro drinks. My boyfriend got it prepared in the regular way with milk and I got mine made with soy milk (because I can't do dairy), both were lovely. The server didn't want to make it with soy because he didn't know how it would come out, but I insisted and it was great. We also had the red bean donut for desert. I missed the sesame outside, but the donut itself was warm and delicious and not too sweet.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find this place down the block from my house. It's a medium/small-sized restaurant with a good amount of tables, but I probably wouldn't bring a big group (6+) here on a weekend.  One small tip, don't sit at either of the 2 tables by the door in the winter. Every time the door would open I could feel the polar vortex chill my bones.

I haven't explored the whole menu but what I had today was delicious. I went in by myself because I had to try the forbidden rice in sushi. I thought it was an upcharge that you had to request but every roll comes with the wholesome purple sushi rice. I ordered the seaweed salad, miso soup, an H3 roll, and hot sake. All were magnificent. The service was amazing, almost everyone that worked there checked in on me without being intrusive. I will definitely try this place again.   (I may give them a 5 after I've eaten there a couple more times)

The food here was so very delicious! I went for Sunday brunch and had the Good Juju smoothie and the Arizona bowl with cauliflower scramble. The good juju was ok, I'm not a huge fan of the cinnamon, but the almond and coconut combo was nice. However the Arizona bowl was *phenomenal*. It's a little bowl but packed with fresh veggies and flavor. At first I thought the bowl was too small but then I couldn't even finish it! It's a rich, dense, and saucy bowl of cooked veggies. The service that day was pretty mediocre. Every one was exceptionally nice and kind but they messed up different aspects our order three times (!!!). If they weren't so darn sweet and charming I might have minded but I enjoyed the staff's company and didn't mind sticking around a little longer chatting with them. Plus I got a delicious and nutritious meal at the end.  I really hope they open up one of these in downtown Phoenix! Green is so unhealthy, and Bragg's needs a friend who makes smoothies and juices! I'll definitely be back.

The food is really delicious here of you like BBQ. The prime rib and home made sausages were phenomenal. Come early so they don't run out of their most popular dishes. I didn't care for waiting in that extra long line and then having to sit outside on picnic tables but at least they were friendly and provided free tiny water bottles so you didn't have a heat stroke while you waited to put in your order.

The food is delicious but there are not a lot of choices for vegetarians. I had the bean and cheese burrito. It was tasty but TINY (it looked like a big flauta) and came with a couple waffle fries. For $6 that was a rip off. I also had the elote (they called it "eskites?") Which was pretty authentic but I wouldn't order it again, too much mayo. The decor *is* nice, and I guess that's what you pay for. The service was TERRIBLE. We walked up to the counter where one women was counting the drawer and the other woman watched and weren't even acknowledged by either of them as we stood and waited in front of them. After a while I greeted them and then the one watching politely told me they'd be with is in a minute. I get it if they are training or something but it happened again when we wanted to order desert. A new cashier just stood there pressing buttons on the register for almost 2 whole minutes. The service staff are in no hurry to help you. The old fashioned ice cream was heavenly and I would go back for desert (only).

I came here on the recommendation of a trainer at LA Fitness up the street. I had a pound of snow crab legs in medium trifecta sauce. They were so delicious, I was scooping the sauce out with my fingers to eat even after I finished the crab legs! My only complaint is the forks. They brought out cheap plastic forks when I asked, as opposed to the tiny forks made for eating crab and lobster. They did have crackers, scissors, bibs and plastic gloves, which I appreciated, though next time I will make sure to bring my own forks from home.
