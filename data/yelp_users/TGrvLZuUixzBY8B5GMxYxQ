I am rating this a "one" because the service was so very bad! They weren't very crowded but it took forever to get our food, the waiter didn't apologize for the delays or anything.  There were three of us, my husband ordered a basic turkey burger and it was so bad he couldn't even eat it the waiter saw that he didn't eat it and never asked if it was okay or anything. The other two meals were average the muffin was great! I wouldn't go back the that location, may try a different location to compare.

My recommendation, do not go!  Tonight's dinner could possibly be the worst experience at any restaurant ever.  Our server was short with us and seemed to have no time and it wasn't even busy.   The food was pure grease with cheeses and sauce. La Torretta was over priced and the atmosphere was plain and seemed quite dated.    I don't know who might have posted the other positive reviews but I can only guess it's family.

Being in business here in the valley for 30 years we have used many catering companies.  Bruce Brown Catering by far has provided us the best service, best staff and food you can only dream about!  I would recommend Bruce Brown Catering for all your events from 35-3500 people!

Went to dinner this past weekend with family to one of our "regular" places". We have found over the past year that Charleston's has not been near as consistent as it used to be. Our favorite meals seem to have lower quality meats and they have changed their menu so salads are no longer included.  It's really no longer an average priced place, but it's become very average food :(

I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!  From the beginning Josie was amazing, answering my husbands questions ( and he called many times ).  Knowing this was a big move for my in-laws, she was right there responding to every call.  We finally signed the contract and moved my in-laws from CA to Arizona. What an amazing job they did!  Alex was the lead and with my elderly family he spent time understanding their fear of moving so far and made them feel comfortable that everything would be fine.  It was better than fine!  Alex did anything he could to help with each step, going as far as just going through boxes to find sheets so they could sleep in their new home the first night.  I can go on and on, but you would stop reading :  Be sure if you can get Alex as your lead to do so! I am sure after working with them, everyone there is awesome!  Thank you Camelback Moving

Today was my first visit to Touch of Tranquility and what an unexpected treat!  I have had many massages in my day, but none have every come close  to  this wonderful one !  Angda is a new therapist there and one would have thought she had years of experience! She talked with me to clearly understand my needs and worked to be sure that she treated every area accordingly.  I recommend the spa, but highly recommend you request Angda!  I am now a client of hers forever :)  !!

I purchased an Earnhardt car in 1974 and I told myself, never again. Well here we are 2011 and I thought, let's give them another shot...somethings never change!!   I went in for my first service on my new Hyundai Sonata and wanted to report that it was a terrible experience.  First, I tried to book it online and told them I was going to wait.  Then I figured, I better call and see how long it was going to  take.  I was shocked when they said 2 to 3 hours.  For a simple oil change  So, we decided to re-book it for the following morning and brought the car in Tuesday afternoon (around 4:45PM) and they told me that  they would have it finished the following morning and would pick me up with the shuttle the next morning.  I get a call at 8:30 AM today that the car is finished.  They said the shuttle would pick me up leaving at 9 AM.  I got several calls from the driver saying he was running late.  He finally picked me up at around 10:30AM.  I pay for the service and the receptionist tells me my car is outside somewhere and I should push my key until I hear the car----in other words it is somewhere in the lot.  I got out to get the car and it was filthy even though they said they would wash it.  I went to the cashier/receptionist and said my car is not washed.  She told me to come back on Friday---two days later.  I said, really, why do I have to come back again?  At first she made up an excuse like,  There was a storm last night.  I said, what does this have to do with my car not being washed today?  She then went on to tell me that they are re-paving the parking lot and the wash would not be turned on for two days.  Really?  Talk about customer service.  If it was me, I would have washed the car by hand.  And that's what I did when I got home and was totally dissatisfied with the service.  If I get this kind of hassle for a simple oil change, what can expect in future?  I do not recommend them!!  FYI, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM NO STARS IF THAT WAS AN OPTION!  Well, it only got worse... My fault, I loved my car hated the dealership and still let my husband buy his new car there after all this.  Well his salesperson Jack/Jacques seemed so nice, had a French background and with a husband from Brussels, it seemed great until he said, oh.. don't worry about that, I'll through it in. ....3 months later, he won't take our calls, no response from voice mails, so never will I have anyone I know buy any car from any Earnhardt dealership....They don't honor what they say, and they give even bad car dealers a bad name....   Think 10 times before buying anything from them!!

My mothers retirement home had a reservation for 30 people at Chompies  tomorrow.  The community called to confirm today and Chompies said they didn't see the reservation and they were to busy with TV stations coming to accommodate them.  The community even had the persons name that took the reservation.  There is a big promotion on tomorrow which they didn't even offer to provide them for a different date.  There are a lot of upset seniors. It's very sad, something they were all looking forward to!!

I am very sorry to say I did not read the bad reviews before making my purchase.  Today on schedule the carpet installers arrived and I must say the were very polite and neat.  They did a great job, I would recommend these sub-contracted installers anytime  but,  due to Empire Today doing something wrong when they got to my Master Bedroom, they ran out of carpet!  Wow, what a surprise! Empire is now saying they can complete the install on Tuesday ( today is Saturday ) which of course means someone stays home from work to manage this.  The dispatch was also very nice but how could this possibly happen?  I did place a call to the salesperson who apologized and basically you could tell she was sorry she ever gave me her phone number.  She was the least helpful of anyone, very disappointed as I expect the sales person to be the one doing anything they can to work things out, sadly not this one!  We will see how Tuesday turns out, if the dye lots are the same and what happens next. As of today, it's a major ONE STAR for Empire Today.

I can't say enough about Melissa at Canvas Salon!  I have been going to her for color and cuts for over 8 years and at least twice a week a stranger comes up to me asking who does my hair  It's so crazy that at Motor Vehicles when I went to update my license, the photo girl asked if she could take pictures with her camera for her stylist!  Actually, the same thing happened at my doctor's office.   If you need PERFECT color from the expert, call Melissa today!
