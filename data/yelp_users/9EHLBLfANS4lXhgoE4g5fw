Atrocious!  We called over the phone to see how long the wait was and if we could put our names down. They said of course and that we would be next for a table when we got there. Upon arriving the manager met with us and told us, ' we dont do a wait list over the phone but we made a special case for you but dont do it again.' Saying it very loudly so everyone else waiting would hear. It was so rude and uncomfortable! Why didnt he just tell us that on the phone when we first called that it was first come first serve? We would have waited. Upon sitting down the entire meal took 2 hours!!! It took forever to get our food and only half of it came. The food was so-so and over expensive mimosas. The water smells like fish..... go ahead smell the water before you sip. You'll understand what I mean. Absolutely disgusting place, I have no idea why it has such high reviews.
