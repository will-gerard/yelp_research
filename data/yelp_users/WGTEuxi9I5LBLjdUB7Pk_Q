Wow. WOW. WOWWWWW!   Man. THIS PLACE. Fantastic. Utterly awesome inside and out.   The patio scene here is great. The food is great. The jams are great. The people are great. This is an all around great spot to grab some delicious food. I tried the fish po'boy, the PB burger (name?), and the fries with pulled pork. All were choice. Hell, even the coleslaw is pretty damn tasty. Check this place out, sit back, take it all in (the neighborhood adds a little bit of sketch to the whole thing, but it makes it feel kinda quaint), and get stuffed. Oh, and be sure to put hot sauce on everything.    Jesus, I am still in a food coma...

Not a fan. Maybe I did not get the right thing. Who knows. I did NOT enjoy my Chicago-style hotdog, despite all of the reviews saying how good the dogs are here.  My friend experienced the same thing. Granted, these "Chicago-style dogs" were not on the menu and had to be improvised, (which I am shocked they were not on the menu...) and they were also missing some key ingredients.   It was an average to below average hot dog that I could have done better at home. I would take a Sonoran style hotdog or a Chicago dog from a little road/parking lot stand any day over these hotdogs.    IMHO, check it out and see for yourself, or save your money and go elsewhere.

Simple, healthy, inexpensive.  Come here if you like the above + teriyaki.  Also come here if you lift heavy weights. This is where bodybuilders hang out.

Earlier this morning I took a trip to Georgia. Wait a sec... I never left Phoenix!  Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is the spot to beeeee, when you want something hot, delicious, and savoryyyyy.   Seriously though, the waffles were on point, the chicken was on point, the service and atmosphere were on point, and the hot sauce game was strong.   Waffles: Buttery, soft, fluffy. Chicken: Juicy, hot, tender, and seasoned well with just enough crunch. Syrup: Syrup. Hot Sauce: Exactly what hot sauce should be with chicken and waffles.   If you have that craving (you know this craving), this is the place to satisfy your needs.   Stop reading, you've made up your mind, just go and get lost in that sauce.

Atmosphere: Pretty cool! Nice and big patio, industrial feel inside with all of the brewing equipment in view, and a mix of yuppies and college kids for lunch!  Food: Fantastic. I've had two of the burgers (today was the Lamb burger) and they were both AWESOME, but the lamb was the best!!  Beer: Great beer. Hop Knot is one of my favorites, and Kiltlifter does not need an explanation.   Service: Pretty good; lot's of young yet competent servers. Even during a busy lunch it does not take very long to be helped.    Go check it out!

Jeff is a top-notch guy with top-notch services!   I somehow managed to lock myself out of my apartment tonight, without my phone, and without a shirt... luckily I had pants on! Long story short I have a security bar on my patio glass door and it fell back into position when I was outside... Anyway, with the help of an awesome neighbor, I was able to get on Yelp and get a hold of A 1 Minute Key Service. Other places wanted to charge me $90+. What a buncha crap. Jeff was busy at another job but took care of me and gave me an A+ price. He even had to drill out my lock (it was a wafer lock) and still charged me a very decent price, including the cost of a new lock.  Good man.

I love this place. The beer is plentiful, the girls are pretty, and the food is delicious. Nothing beats coming in and getting three giant pretzels for about a dollar each. The service was excellent, Lissett and Marleena  (I made sure to get their names just for this article) were both very helpful when it came to my beer selection, plus they provided plenty of entertainment for my friend and I. The patio makes for a great spot to drink and socialize. Thank you Mellow, I had a great time!

Fantastic frozen yogurt!!  Aloha makes some damn good stuff. There has been a new flavor (or a few) every time that I venture over there. The music is great. The service is fantastic and friendly. They make their flavors in house using real, fresh, and simple ingredients! On top of all of this, the prices are pretty good, the mix-ins are plentiful, and did I mention that this yogurt is fantastic? 'Cause it is.   Chocolate fro-yo + some almonds/nuts + some snickers chunks + some carob chips + some peanut butter cup crumbles + plus some shredded coconut + some fresh banana + some peanut butter + some nutella = HEAVEN. RICH, TEXTURED, CHOCOLATE HEAVEN.

Some friends and I checked Jamburritos out at First Friday in downtown Phoenix.  The people working the truck were pleasant. The Cat Fish Po'Boy was pretty good, my friend from Louisiana said that it was a valiant effort. The special of the day, a Pineapple Pork Po'Boy, was not very good. They ruined it when they put "nacho cheese" on it. Same with the nachos. I get it, nacho cheese is nacho cheese (belongs on nachos...), but that is like the shitty cheese you get at a baseball game, ya know what I'm saying? Put some real nice cheese on there. $8 sandwiches should not have $0.08 cents worth of shit cheese on them. Nor should nachos from a good food truck!  I might try them again, but would be hard-pressed to get anything besides the Cat Fish Po'Boy.   Maybe they were having an off night...

Hoooooooo shitttttt.  This place. Lemme tell you a bit about this place. You walk in. At first you think that you look like you don't belong here. But you do. 'Cause this place sells love. And I don't mean sex. I mean taco love. Taco love is a sacred kind of love. If you don't know about taco love, take a knee; I'm gonna tell you allllll about it.   You start off with the carnitas. The deliciously grilled, perfectly seasoned, slightly smokey goodness of pork that just wants to be wrapped up in a tortilla and put in your mouth. While you're at it, throw in some camarones (that's shrimp for all you non-españoles). They have the tastiest saucy glaze of goodness all up in there. Cooked just right. If it were pasta, I'd have to say al dente. Then check out a little grilled steak or maybe a little al pastor. Throw a cucumber on your grilled steak if you're into that kinda thing... This is taco lovin'; everyone is different... Go ahead, get a little freaky with it. Oh and did I mention that they give you sweet, caramelized, big ole onions to do whatever with? I didn't. But now I just did. I say put them on your carne asada taco, but hey that is just the way I like to experience some down south taco love. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say these are better than the street tacos in Rocky Point. Yes. I said it.   The horchata is choice. Primo. ¡Excellente!  They have menudo and other stews that are served all day.  They grill the meat out back.  The salsa bar is fresh.   The girls at the counter like to dance and have a good time, of course after they give you great service and what not.   I could scrounge enough change (~$1.30) (!!!!!!!) to buy a taco in about two min outside of safeway - not my thing, but it could be!   Huevos rancheros served all day too. Imagine that. Breakfast whenever.   The cherry on top: you get the nice mexican jazz party music playing in the background too. None of that mexican country crap. The real stuff. The jams.  And that there is taco love. You finish up and leave. With a belly full of love.   You should go here. Get some taco lovin'. Write a little yelp review about it and let the world know how good you feel.  This is the kinda love that people go to war for.  Oh and those spicy carrots from the salsa bar were not very flavorful. I dunno what it was, but they were missing something major.   Ok, now I'm done. See ya!

I have eaten at other Hot Bagel locations and have had a good experience. I would rate these experiences a solid 4 stars. However, yesterday I was served one of the saltiest meals I have ever eaten. I was even drunk at the time and it still tasted like crap. I got the Taylor Ham w/ egg and cheese. My friend said his sandwich was also very salty.  Plus, the ham was very thin which was disappointing to me. Yes, I understand that Taylor Ham is expensive, but you can just shave off a few small pieces and call it good!  I hate to say it, but Denny's can make a better sandwich than the one I had yesterday.

I used to visit this place many years ago when I lived in town. Dr. Robert and his wife are such awesome people, who care about you not only as an individual, but about your health and well being.   The roller tables are quite relaxing, and included in the treatment. The receptionist (I forgot her name /: ) was always warm and welcoming, greeting me on a first name basis and building a friendly relationship with me. I very am excited to visit them tomorrow!  The doctors here were always generous and helped me out financially, as I was a poor student with back issues. They did this on merit, with the hopes  that I will be able to come back in the future and support their business. I will DEFINITELY be back and will pay extra to make up for all of their generosity.   Please do not dismiss this fine establishment just because another reviewer was upset. You should totally give them a crack!! (haha get it? a crack... cause they crack your back... )   :D

Random 5am doughnut craving? Well fear not, Arizona Donut Co has you covered!  The ladies working there will (hopefully) greet you with a cheerful smile and help you keep your glucagon (opposite of insulin) levels in check. They have all of the classic varieties that you'd expect but these taste as if they were made with love. They are heavenly and soft and delicious.   A dollar and some change for a dozen fresh doughnut holes?!   Sign me up!  Oh and the ham and cheese croissant was pretty good. The ham was a bit lost in that croissant, but it was good. I might just go ahead and buy the plain croissants, bring them home, stuff them with ham and cheese myself, microwave for 10 seconds, and then slowly melt into a puddle on my kitchen floor while my brain releases all sorts of happy chemicals.  Damn. That there's a good doughnut.

I ventured in here a few months ago (took notes) and am finally writing a review. I was in the area and was having a serious craving for sushi. Needless to say, this is one of, if not the highest rated sushi bar in Glendale, so I took the bait. Anyway, my first impression was a busy restaurant with terrible fluorescent lighting and barren walls. The awful, whining sounds of country music playing overhead leaving me wondering why the hell I was listening to country music in a Japanese restaurant. Who knows.   Anyway, I sat down and was promptly greeted by my server. She took my order and rushed off to the next table. I noticed that KC, the sushi chef, was cranking out orders one after another. His cuts were precise and his methods were fluid. I was getting excited thinking that I would soon be trying that very sushi he was preparing.    Crab & Cucumber Salad = Tasty & complementary. Low sodium soy sauce = nice to have. white pickled ginger = my favorite, I hate the pink stuff. salmon nigiri = fresh. and a generous portion. sushi rice = not too shabby.  rainbow roll = large and fresh.   The service ended up being a bit shoddy throughout the night, but I suspect that the girl was a bit overwhelmed with the rush. She seemed absent but might have just been thrown off by my style of ordering one item at a time from the bar while I enjoy my beer+saki. She did however load me up with ginger when I asked for extra.   I would give the service a 3.5/5   I give the atmosphere a 2/5  I would give the food a 4.5/5  Oh and for salmon nigiri and a rainbow roll my total was only $12...   Price = 5/5.   If I am ever in Glendale, I will most definitely be back and I would recommend anyone to come enjoy some fresh, quality sushi!!    Check this place out!!

Well, someone better go pull the car 'round, my knees have buckled. Too much flavor. Make sure you sit down when you try this. I don't even think I have had true BBQ until today. My life has been a lie.   My friend J and I must have gotten there just in time (around 10:40 on Saturday) because there was a good sized line already and it kept growing and growing. We walked right up to what we thought was the back of the line and were questioned by a couple guys if this was our first time while everyone else just stared. Turns out that was the front of the line... To the back we go! Note: the line starts by all of the outdoor seating (southside).   Anyway, we waited for what seemed to be about 40 minutes with our hunger growing exponentially by the minute. We finally found ourselves standing outside of that little plastic curtain that separates the desperate from the confident. We could finally see meat. Hell we have been smelling delicious smoked goodness for the past 40 min, WE COULD FINALLY SEE THE MEAT! The line moved forward and we were finally in. We made it. The owner was behind the counter cutting meat like a mad man with surgical precision. You are not paying for fat and other shit. You pay for the real thing here. So much meat. So much variety.   Although the owner was busy trimming away, he had plenty of time to entertain and jest with the customers. He had this almost sarcastic sense of humor about him that kept things lively in there. It was cool to see someone that involved in their passion and business. Waiting in line can make people grumpy, that is why the owner likes to hand out samples! What the hell is this "fatty brisket" that I keep hearing about?   Boom. Here is my opportunity. This is it. Here we go.   ***Please excuse me while I have the first BBQ induced seizure ever recorded***   There was no sauce. It didn't need sauce. What the hell kind of BBQ doesn't need sauce!? Why did it just melt like that? I hardly even had to chew it. What the fuck is going on?!   That was easily one of the top 10 things I have ever put in my mouth.   I don't think this is BBQ, people. This is something else. Either every "BBQ" meal I have ever had has been completely wrong, or this place is just selling something superior and calling it "BBQ". Either way this place is way out of the league. It is not fair for other BBQ places. It is the equivalent of a teenager beating up a five year old. But hey, I'm not complaining!  I digress though, I ended up getting the pulled pork sandwich and have no regrets. I will be back. I will get more. This place is clean, well-run, and the BBQ is dripping with passion and love. Come see for yourself.  Note: The shade can be spotty at times so be sure to wear sunscreen or bring an umbrella if you are sensitive to the sun. Camping chairs are great to have too if it is before 11.

Excellent shop. Sweet lounge-esque atmosphere. Good music, pool table, trendy design.   The staff was friendly, the juice was plentiful, and they let you drip test.  I needed a new o-ring for my cap and they hooked it up/put it on for me. They also hooked up some cotton (yes I know it is cheap, but not all shops would do this!) and let me use their tools to set up for my newly purchased flavors!  They also supply a line of all natural flavors.  10/10 would come here again for anything vape related.

Excellent Indian food. EXCELLENT.  They have a ton of delicious stuff that I have never had/heard of, but expect tons of veggies, chicken, potatoes, and curry.   The lunch buffet (yes, a GREAT Indian buffet), was under $10!!!!! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!  Seriously though, if you want some awesome Indian food here in Tempe, this is the place to go.   Check it out.

This was my first event here in Phoenix and I must say that it was a pretty good time! The cinema/bar combo was an awesome idea and I hope to come back and watch a show sometime. The movie itself was some crazy 80's movie that I'd never heard of and frankly was not half bad! The hotdogs provided out front by Short Leash were also pretty good and very creatively flavored/dressed. I look forward to exploring more of that the Phoenix area has to offer and meeting more Yeeps up here!  Thank you Lindsey!

Awesome vibe out at the patio bar, we felt like we were at the beach! The manager and owner are very friendly and excited to be apart of this area and hope that their new restaurant gains popularity. The concept for this restaurant came from the same guy that owns all of the US Egg locations around town. I've never been there so I cannot relate any similarities or differences, but this place has a pretty cool thing going. The location is pretty close to ASU, right on the light rail path, and has some awesome interior decoration/design. Jazz music is their jam. I like that. They also happen to have one of the best sign spinners that I've ever seen. Anyway on to the good stuff:  We ordered Chicken & Waffles with a side of Jalapeno Mac n' Cheese. I'd say it was pretty good, but not on the same caliber as something like Rosco's. Perhaps it was because I got the breast (I normally prefer dark meat). Anyway, the chicken was flavorful and cooked perfectly, but there was still something awry. The waffles were golden and crispy, also cooked to perfection. Perhaps I prefer a thinner waffle? I cannot quite put my finger on what was wrong. The hot sauce choices could be a little better. I opted for Cholula vs. Tabasco, but I feel like they need some Louisiana hot sauce or some Franks. Maybe I want crispier skin on my chicken. I still do not know what was missing. Anyway, it was not bad, but it was not quite like the chicken and waffles that I have come to love.   The manager recommended the mac n cheese, but my friend and I were not fans. It lacked flavor. It was bland and needed more of a cheesy taste. Perhaps some ham or bacon, or a sharper cheese. Hell even a little salt and pepper might work. I ended up putting hot sauce on it and that helped a little but not a lot.   I am interested to see how this restaurant does in the near future and look forward to checking it out again. This place has some serious potential to be a fun little spot.  Go see for yourself!!

Well that sure was disappointing.. I wanted to like it. I really did. I came in with high expectations and left with some crappy taste in my mouth.   It was the "soft opening" at the new Nourish cafe, people were excited, and there was a 50% off deal for students. That drew me in. I was immediately greeted by a pleasant cashier and told that they were technically still in training so I took that into account and lowered my expectations a little. I took a look at the menu and saw that they had a "burger" option which was your choice of a 1/4lb or 1/2lb grass-fed beef patty, with lettuce, onions, and tomato, wrapped up in some kinda tortilla thing. There was an option to add bacon, cheese, sauteed onions, sauteed mushrooms, or avocado for an extra charge. You are also given the option of a hamburger bun or a sourdough bun for an extra charge. I decided to go big due to the 50% off and added bacon, cheese, sauteed onion, and the sourdough bun (recommended by the cashier) to my 1/2 lb burger. So far, so good.  The cashier was having trouble ringing up my order and had to have someone come over multiple times, over a period of at least five or ten minutes, before my order was entered correctly. This I shrugged off because they were in training and I know what it can be like to be new to a restaurant. Anyway, I ended up getting my burger a little while later, but to my surprise, it did not come with the sauteed onions. I brought it back up to the counter and they immediately apologized and gave me some complimentary iced tea while I waited which made me happy. They said that they would just have to "fire it up" again in order to make my order right. I was not sure if this meant warm it up with the onions, or make another burger. I figured that they would just reheat my burger so I was a bit worried that it would no longer be medium rare. Again, they are in training, so I do not mind too much. Shit happens.   Well, I ended up getting my burger back in the end and sitting down to eat with my friends. First bite. Char. All I can taste is char. What about that delicious grass fed beef? Nope. Just char and some sourdough. I was kinda disappointed at this point. Everything looked and sounded so good. The prices were high so I guess you expect more too. I commented to a friend how this could use a bit of this delicious chipotle ketchup that I have at home. I get about half way done and decided to save the rest as leftovers. A few minutes later I hear a waitress bring another patron his burger and she offered him chipotle ketchup! Man, I wish they offered me that. It woulda covered the crappy taste really nicely. I also wish that they toasted the bun a bit.  Will I come back and eat here? Maybe. Probably not though. Sure, it is convenient, but the prices are a bit steep (I paid $7.50 with the 50% discount!). The prices are probably high because they use high quality, fresh, and nutritious ingredients. I think everything is gluten free and they are conscious of many food allergies. This is great for people with food restrictions. For someone who luckily does not have a food allergy, this place is too pricey (in my opinion), especially when food comes out tasting like my burger. I will give it another try if the prices come down or they have another special, otherwise, I wish them luck and hope that they improve over time...  Don't take my word for it though. Maybe I just had a bad experience. Go check it out for yourself! I hope your experience blows mine outta the water!

I've been able to try the food a few more times now during catered events. The vegetarian foods are not too shabby, the meat is terrible, and ordering in the restaurant is still a bit expensive for the portions and quality of cooking that you receive. The service has improved a bit though.  Please Nourish, PLEASE learn how to cook meat. Your chicken is drier than any other chicken that I have EVER been served at a restaurant. Many of my friends have agreed about this. Please figure that bit out. It is a shame that such great quality meat is prepared in this manner.   If you want the public to have a wonderful experience here, learn how to cook meat properly, make sure that the service is top notch, and maybe even lower your prices a little. If you can only do one of those, pick the meat! If the food is great, some people will still pay the prices, regardless of the service, as long the food is fantastic!

Man, I love Thai food. So much diversity and layer after layer of texture and flavor; all with just the right spice. Chanpen does not skimp when it comes to flavor. Their food was delicious. Excellent. I got two entrees just so I'd have those coveted Thai leftovers when the midnight munchies kick in. Panang Curry and Pad See Ew.   This place could definitely use a bit more night time ambiance. The overhead fluorescent lights were a bit distracting and sterile. If they had some softer lighting dispersed through the restaurant, that would take this place to another level. Some soft music would be a plus too! All that stuff doesn't really matter though cause the food was so good.  The service was slow and a bit inattentive, but once the food came out, I stopped caring real quick. I had stepped into another world. After my meal, I was brought some complementary and homemade coconut-pineapple ice cream. F@*$ing delicious. Thank you Chanpen. I will be back. I will bring my money.  Food-wise, this place is easily among the top Thai restaurants here in Arizona. I may have to find a way to marry into the family.
