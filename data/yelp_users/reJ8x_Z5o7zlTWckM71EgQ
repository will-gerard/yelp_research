I started taking my Honda to this Midas in early 2009. Keith who is the store manager there has always been helpful upfront and honest about my car. He would tell me what had to be fixed that day what could wait so many miles to be fixed later and what he would charge for each option. The front desk man is also always nice. It only took one stop in my new Toyota at Toyota service center on Camelback to realize how good I had it at this Midas. I brought my Toyota in this month and they did the oil change for 30 bucks and the car inspection including tire rotation alignment etc. while Toyota wanted to charge me over $80 for the same service.  I recommend this Midas to people and if you ask for Keith or Richard or Bill you have the same experience I have.

My husband and I still take our cars to this Midas! Mike and Keith are excellent at customer service and know their stuff about cars! My Toyota Corolla has recently had fan belt issues since February. Midas has replaced one of the belt for free because it was still making noise within a month. They have also tighten it down multiple times with extra checks and no charge for that. Can't say enough! Thank you!!

PHENOMENAL!!!! HONEST!!!!! GOOD MAN BRIAN-saved my doggy!    I will be giving Brian all my business for as long as I am in AZ. I went there based on the yelp review Friday after Midas couldn't figure out the reason my car alarm was randomly going off. This was noon before a 3 day holiday weekend and Brian took an hour to sort out the circuitry and unhook some wires to see if anything made a difference. He figured I would need an actuator for my driver door since it's the main lock communicating with the key fab. He did that after the weekend and only charged 145 for it (wouldn't let me pay him on Friday)!   The very next day I accidently LOCKED my keys in my CAR with my DOG in it !!!!   95 degrees and dog in car, is a CRISIS. First I called a locksmith so they were on their way in 30 min then the police who said it was an emergency and were sending the fire truck. In the meantime I dialed Brian to see if he had recommendations how to get in best. He actually said he had a box of old keys and they might work so HE DROVE TO US and beat the fire dept and locksmith and opened my car on the 5th key try. Cancel 911 and locksmith, BRIAN to the rescue. Honest dependable service at a reasonable price. He is very knowledgeable and easy to understand and talk too. I don't know anyone else who can say they can call their mechanic anytime and have him pick up the phone willing to help. THANK YOU BRIAN!

On a Sunday we noticed our washer leaking a small amount of water on the floor. We left messages at 3 places on yelp and by 8 am Monday E&J  had called back and scheduled a same day service! They are very reasonably priced and friendly. Our aerator was at a weird angle. Eric ran the washer 4 times and no leak. He was finished in an hour. Our washer is a double stack in a small closet so we really appreciate the level of service and no complaints about squeezing in. We will use them for all our appliance needs.

My lettter to united regarding online and phone reservations: I have an issue with your website. I looked at booking tickets from PHX on Friday. At 11:15am, PST, I started my process and spoke with a lady named Jem. She said book online after answering my question. So I get online and find the flights home for $490 per person. I begin my booking and about 10 min later after entering information for everything including payment, I press "process" and I get an error message. So I proceed to wait half an hour and try again. This goes on until 1pm then I'm back on the phone with customer service because I can't get the website to process my payment. In the 45 minutes I'm on hold I finally receive the answer that the price has now changed to 636, then in 10 more minutes its 690 per person. What is wrong with United, this is dishonest, I start booking a flight for one price and have to pay another because my payment won't process online. Finally, the lady tells me she has escalated my issue and I'll receive a call back in 24 hours. That never happened. Today, Tuesday Sept 17th, I try again to book online at the $490 per person price and receive the same error. So I get Shea, employee ID 1-L, who after 23 minutes has no explanation as to why I see $490 but can only offer me $596 per person. This is the most ridiculous online booking process and worst customer service I have ever experienced with an airline. I wish I had a choice in airlines, but United is contracted with Great Lakes to fly into my hometown. Finally, after 23 minutes of arguing, Shea transfers me to Lisa in the ".com" dept. Lisa is professional in hearing out my problems and resolves them in the next half an hour. Consider fixing your website via I.T. and empowering your employees, like Shea, to resolve issues as Lisa is able and you'll retain business instead of lose it. In fact, she's the only one I would hire for my personal business. I'm extremely disgruntled by United and can't be the only customer upset by such service.

George is wonderful! Not only is he a locally owned one man show who is a genuine man unafraid to work hard and get the job done! I just came home to my carpet's and I always think WOW George did it again. I found him here on yelp and will continue to write reviews as I will always use him as my carpet cleaning man. I own a 55 lb dog and no matter how much you vacuum and spot treat, she still brings in mud on those paws. However, a visit from Paradise Carpet Cleaning really leaves the house looking like paradise. He uses great products that are safe for animals and kids. If you have any questions for cleaning on the go stains he will gladly answer and give you background information as well as how to's.

I recently have endured 2 shoulder surgeries. I did them one at a time so I would have a functioning arm and another in a sling. In February I traveled to Las Vegas and back to Phoenix. The flight attendants were wonderful assisting me in getting my carry on suitcase into the overhead bin and another passenger got it out when we arrived at our destination both ways. I was pleased with my service. This last weekend on May 18th I received the same assistance, boarding first with my assigned seat a being assisted to get the luggage in the overhead bin. My left arm is only able to lift 5 lbs overhead at the moment as it is in rehab. My right arm is in a sling because of my most recent surgery. This morning May 21st on the flight 190 from Idaho Falls, ID to Phoenix-Mesa, I was boarding as usual with my assigned seating and was asking for help from a flight attendant named Kerry. I did not get to explain that not only because of my disability and sling but my weak left arm that I was unable to lift my luggage.Kerry point blank, interrupted my request and said, "We are not allowed to assist with lifting luggage into overhead bins, I can check it for you. You'll have to ask a passenger, we see 600 people a day and can't help with bags" I was astonished since I hadn't ever been denied standard customer service with my disability. I laughed at her and said "What a joke?!? Everyone else has helped on my previous flights."  At this point I proceeded forward requesting assistance with obvious irritation. I had never heard of a policy or procedure of the sort. SO I took the liberty to read thru your contract of carriage. There is nothing that says a flight attendant won't or is not allowed to assist. Discrimination is listed under the disability section and how Allegiant will comply with federal law.   I asked for her name from another flight attendant, who reported back to Kerry. Kerry then came and accused me of not coming to her for her name. She hadn't walked by or I would have asked. She reminded me that she was following policy and offered to check my bag for free. Kerry continued that I would be removed from the plane if I caused any more trouble. I replied that I had been helped before and this was terrible service and she needed to go away. Personally, I have very little experience with such terrible customer service and I was not going to send this but the situation continued. During our flight, after the captain turned off the fasten seat belt sign another flight attendant was opening overhead bins for three other customers and getting them their computer bags and purses. When she was digging in the bin above me she said, "We're not supposed to be lifting these since we see 600 people a day."  That seemed to be directed at me as no  one else looked up and she looked at me. The women I was sitting with said, "That's inappropriate." Now I've been dis-serviced, discriminated against and harassed. Are flight attendant's truly required not to help passengers with luggage? If so, perhaps you should add it to your Contract of Carriage. Furthermore, consider putting up signs that say "Flight attendants may not assist you with your luggage." I think it is absolutely horrible that Kerry and her co-employee acted in this manner and that I, having been through enough, endured it in front of the rest of the flight. I will be seeking more advice on how to change this for other disabled Americans. I have flown with my service dog before as well and was assisted with my luggage last December. Until today, I was pleased with Allegiant.

We came for valentines day and it's crazy busy all the time!!! Great food but we waited 20 min for our check so the server brought us two free dinner gift cards!!!! Amazing way to over make right what's been done wrong... Slow service at the end to get our check was more than compensated for and we will for sure come back again

I cannot say enough about the integrity of this man! Dove is honest, knowledgeable, and open. He asks many questions so he can get the job done right. Not only that, he is very reasonably priced. He came in just under another builders quote for our patio roof. We ended up going with the other builder because they were more all-inclusive to the different projects we needed for the entire home. However when I had extra questions that weren't explained properly, I reached out to Dove and he gave me his expert opinion. I owe him a consulting fee, but he doesn't charge one! If you need a contractor for carpentry and big wood projects, Shapira builders is your company!

We stopped in after a hike for breakfast. The outdoor patio is adorable and dog friendly! They brought our pup water and a treat bag of biscuits and cookies. My husband had the chilaquiles verde and I had the huevos rancheros- both lick your plate good! Bursting with flavor! I recommend asking for a side of hot sauces- they brought a chili lime and medium warm, both great flavor enhancers. We ll be back for sure! The happy hour looks great too!

We had tickets waiting at will call to see Al Madrigal on a Friday night and there was 1 PERSON WORKING!!! All proceeds for this 730 show go to our favorite rescue ROCKSTAR RESCUE. We waited in will call for over 20 minutes when a couple offered us tickets. We went upstairs to go in but unfortunately we were sent back to will call to get tickets that could be scanned. Of course we were pushed further back in line which meant another 20 minutes and we hadn't moved more than 6 spots. So we left. We'll donate to Rockstar and take Stand Up Live off our list of place to go. They are in severe need of staffing and are overwhelmed. On a Friday night there is no excuse for having one person working will call if you want to start shows on time and please your customer base.

Our diposal stopped working and smelled funny, so I hopped on yelp to look for a recommended plumber. I called at 8pm and Eric answered!! He said to try the reset button but because of the smell we may have a lemon and burned out our motor. For a flat rate of $325 his service could replace our disposal! We set up an appt and Edward came out to fix our disposal a day later. He said it was just jammed and he showed my husband how to fix that issue going forward.  NOT ONLY was our disposal ok, but he didn't charge us a service fee at all. He said "We are not here to rip you off."  THIS IS THE TYPE OF OLD SCHOOL SERVICE/COMPANY THAT HAS GONE MISSING FROM AMERICA. We will never use another plumber again!

I scheduled carpet cleaning 10 days ahead because life is really busy in the fall. The day before my husband and I vacuumed and prepared the house (moving furniture, rugs etc). The day of Shawn called to reschedule or come later. A couple people called out. Later didn't workout so we ended up trying to squeeze in the next morning at 8am. 730am we get a call a hose is broken and it will be 825; this wouldn't be a problem without prior commitments at 9-1045 and at 1130.... Then miraculously Matthew appeared at 755!!! He's my favorite. Always polite and does a great job. Shawn called to say he was on his way himself because of the short staff, miscommunications we already had Matthew so Shawn headed to another job. Even though they couldn't clean is our scheduled day they offered a great discount and followed through.

Inheriting the BRCA-1 gene wasn't an easy thing to learn. However, I saw Dr Carrie Cashman for my breast removal and she recommended 3 plastics docs for reconstruction. I had a terrible experience with one of them, he basically made reconstruction sound like no big deal, no need for physical therapy and showed me tear drop shaped implants. I decided to get a second opinion on this "too good to be true" reconstruction. I landed in Dr Kalnoki's office, SHE IS THE BEST! Not only did she spend 2 hours with me at my consult, she explained why you need therapy and what shape implants (not the tear drops because they'll flip and you'll have awkward boobs), all about risks and benefits and how to choose whats best for you, as an INDIVIDUAL.  She's done a fellowship and has immense knowledge. I woke up from my mastectomy with reconstruction happy as a clam! My breasts look almost identical to before they were removed and redone! Dr K monitored me closely and her office staff, Tammy answers all my questions....Holly helps you schedule and Kris knows about insurance. They are wonderful. Being a gym/swim gorilla they kept me on a tight leash and didn't sugar coat anything. More offices need to be like that! I am going in for some fat-grafting procedures to make sure my breasts are even closer to normal. Dr K takes your own fat and injects it where you have divots and dimples. She has a very keen eye. If you don't believe me, head on in for you consult.

We heard about this at our pharmacy, because a patient inquired about IV vitamins and looked up "The Drip Room" online to see what it was about. We called The Drip Room and asked a staff member what medications were in the extreme party drip. He said he didn't know the names of the medications and all that he knew was that it was anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory. Online it says pain medicine. When asked where the medicaitons and IV's came from he said in "internationally renowned compounding pharmacies" but not the names of these pharmacies. We further inquired about the news on the meningitis from compounding pharmacies. He stated he had never heard of any such outbreak. SO they are clueless. He said there are naturopathic doctors and nurses there to give the IV and paramedics on staff. (???)We were told we could never get enough vitamins through our diet or supplements, no matter what we only get 30%. He said that the best is IV, then a shot and then sublingual through the mouth (anyone else know this is under the tongue). This place is a crock of crap. Who really wants to trust someone to give you an IV of "vitamins" and "medicines" when they don't know where they come from. Nevermind the contamination of the bags and where they are ordering from may or may not be accredited or legit. BE CAREFUL.
