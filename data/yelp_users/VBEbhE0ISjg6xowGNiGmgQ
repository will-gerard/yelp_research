Probably the nicest restaurant proprietors in The Valley. These people are AWESOME.   Blue Fin is a great lunch place...healthy, fast, inexpensive and tasty. The atmosphere is simple and clean.   The only bad thing about this restaurant is that they're not open late enough, and they remain closed on the weekends.   But again, the number one draw to this place is clearly the people. The owners are wonderful, and so is every other person who works there. I can't say enough!

This is one of those places that really pisses me off.   The food is very good, the beer is even better, and the atmosphere is super-cool. It's just the type of place we need more of in downtown Phoenix. It's even open late!  Unfortunately I have to give it one lonely star because the service so often SUCKS. More than once I'v been told that because I don't have a reservation I'd have to wait up to 45 minutes despite the fact that the place was less than 50% full.  The final straw was in the middle of July, when I was asked to "please wait outside" for my table. Are you kidding me? The food ain't THAT good.

Let's see, what do I like most about this radio station? hmmmm...  I would have to say, the fact that they pay me. But I should also mention that it's the best country station in the (well) country.   It also has the best morning show in town: Dave Pratt in the Morning.  Check it out, 5am-9am every weekday.

Convenient and tasty. I work right next door to this place, and it's like my office's cafeteria.   The best thing about this restaurant are the wonderful people who run it. They're always very friendly and helpful.   They feature a surprisingly diverse menu that ranges from the obvious (gyros and pitas) to the not-so-"Athenian" (egg salad sandwhiches and ruebens).   One thing I really like about this restaurant is how generous they are with their high-quality indgredients. You can really tell they don't cut many corners.  It should also be mentioned that they have the best Greek salad in town. It's delicious! (just get it without the onions, thy're way too strong)

Just about everything you can ask for in a lunch place: tasty, efficient, healthy and reasonably priced. A little expensive, but reasonable.   I really like this place. Almost everything I've ever had on the menu is good, including the often overlooked rice bowls (which I actually prefer over the wraps).   The vegetables they use in their wraps and bowls are fresh and delicious. Whatever you decide to order, try to make sure it has broccoli in it...it tastes like they picked it this morning.  They're a little short on sides (I'd pass on the chips and salsa), and the parking is a pain in the ass.   My biggest complaint about this restaurant is (what else) it's only open for lunch. HELLO! There are people who live in downtown Phoenix! We need places at which we can eat dinner! Contrary to popular belief, this is not a zip code in which people work during the day, have lunch, and then depart. We are here at night too! Feed us!!!

Cool place, great for a weekday lunch (as long as you don't mind smelling like Mexican food for the rest of the day).  The taco is the best I've had in Arizona, and the super-nachos are so big, it's kind of embarrassing to walk through the restaurant with them.  Also - the bakery is excellent! You can visit twice a week for a year and try something new each time. The stuffed churros are particularly delicious.

This place sucks.  AJ's already pisses me off for being so ridiculously overpriced, but  this location is dirty and poorly run to top it off.   Ok, to be honest, it's not THAT dirty or poorly run, but I did once buy a refrigerated package of hummus that already had mold on it.   I would probably give this place 3 or 4 stars if not for the prices. The prices are just stupid. The beer selection and salad bar are ok, but again, did I mention how maniachally expensive everything is?  I also don't cook a lot. So maybe this place is useful if you cook a lot and you need some ingredient you can't get anywhere else. But in that case, you'd still have to be the Prince of Dubai to be able to afford a lamb chop and a jar of imported chutney (or whatever people who cook put in their food).

This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food.   Unfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!  I suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted.

Outstanding! A Valley Legend!  This is one of my all time favorite Valley restaurants. Great food, very warm and friendly service, and great drinks.   Might I suggest the Pollo Cubano or the Cho Cho. The latter may be one of the best kept secrets in Arizona.  We need more restaurants like Havana!

Great sandwiches and a BEAUTIFUL atmosphere.   The Farm is a perfect place to spend an afternoon with a huge group or just one special person. If you're going, try to reserve some extra time, there's a lot of nice walking to be done and it's just not worth going if you can't relax and enjoy the environment.  A couple words of caution: Don't bother going in the summer. The whole experience is about being outside and, well...  Also (and this is the restaurant's only real downfall) the sandwiches are PRICEY! Most average around $10 and that's before you add on a side or drink.

What a sandwich! Not a lot of frills, and the sides are underwhelming, but if you just want a really good toasted sandwich for lunch...Sticklers will hit the spot.   And it's downright cheap!  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars, is because the service was a little course, and the place was REALLY busy without a lot of seating space. Plus, it's only open 'till 4 PM! And not at all on weekends! DOWNTOWN RESTARANTS THAT ARE ONLY OPEN FOR LUNCH ON WEEKDAYS DRIVE ME CRAZY!!!!!!!!  Come to think of it, the fact that I was willing to give it 4 stars despite all that is a testament to how awesome their sandwiches are., because there aren't many other good things to say about it.

My second favorite deli in the Valley. It's behind only the legendary DeFalco's.  BTW - isn't it funny that a Jewish guy's two favorite delis in the AZ are ITALIAN delis? what does that tell you abou the general quality of Jewish delis in AZ?  Anyway, this is one of my favorite downtown lunch spots...like most downtown places I WISH THEY WERE OPEN LATER!!!  Good sandwiches, good pasta. The tuna, the vegetarian and the caprese are particularly good. Only one choice for bread, but it's tastey.  Great giardinaire.  The owner's not that friendly (especially for a neighborhood place), but I think he's just shy.  No sides! that's a big problem with this place...it's basically chips or a lonely sandwich...and I HATE a lonely sandwich.  Oh, and it's a little pricey for what you get.  Overall, the quality of ingredients still makes this place a 4-star stop.

Malee's is one of my favorite restaurants in The Valley. It's the type of place we need more of; good, friendly service, tasty ethnic food, and a very urban feel that might make you forget you're in a suburb.  Everything I've ever had on the menu has been delicious, and the interior is comfortable and cool. The best thing about Malee's is that it's hip without trying to be.

This is by far the best deli in all of the Valley (OK, that's noy saying a WHOLE lot), and may also be the best sandwich place too.  Every single thing on this menu is great, from the caprese sandwich to the lasagna. And don't forget about the Italian sausage...delicious!  Plus, the people are super-cool and the environment is friendly and comfortable.  Only two drawbacks:   1) The wait, especially on the weekends. This place gets busy, and it takes them a really long time to make stuff.  2) The bathroom still uses that old cloth towel rotator thing...you know, the one you have to pull down in segments? That thibg is really gross, and may not be at all sanitary. Seriously, do they just keep using the same one huge cloth the whole time? Does it get replaced, or do the just wait for it to dry and then rotate it back in? Either way, I don't see how that's a good idea.  Ok, sorry I spent so much time on that. For God's sake, I gave this place 5 stars you'd think I would concentrate a little more on the positive!

OK, let's face it: there are better steaks in the Valley. As a matter of fact, if you just took the steak at face value, it might not even crack the top 5.   But Durant's is not just about the steak, or even the food.   Durant's is a classic in every sense of the word, the type of place that can rarely be found anywhwere in Phoenix. It's also a lively and classy night spot, something that didn't exist anywhere in downtown Phoenix for years, and as several new places have developed around Durant's overe the past few years, it has remained consistent and cool.   And that's what Durnat's is really about. Yeah, the steak is pretty good. The seafood's alright. The bread with the hot garlic butter is awesome. But Durant's is just COOL. It's classic Vegas, Rat Pack-style cool, and you feel it from the moment you walk in.

This may not simply be the best Mexican restaurant in the Valley, it may simply be the best restaurant, period.   The service is cool but friendly, the environment is hip and still inviting, and the food is nothing short of brilliant.   I eat there as often as possible.

This is probably my favorite Valley destination for standard Mexican food. As soon as you walk in, you can tell it's steeped in Valley tradition...  If you come by when it's not busy, you can sit at "The President's Table" which is the table at which President Bush sat when he dined there with Jerry Coangelo, Bob Brenly and Artie Moreno.  If that's taken, ask for "The Mayor's Table", where The Morning Mayor Dave Pratt is known to sit when he visits.  Now I'm no fundamentalist, but I still can't deny that "The Presidential Special" (two enchiladas, rice and beans) is probably the best traditional Mexican dish I've ever had in Arizona.   Somewhat surprisingly, the shrimp taco is also REALLY good.   If you stop by, make sure you ask for their very friendly owner, Zippy. Ask him to tell you about some celebrity who's come by in the past. His stories alone will make your evening.

Good pizza, really cool atmosphere, and make sure you save room for dessert, because the crepes are awesome!  It's also a really great place for a date. The pizzas and salads almost seem taylor-made for two-person sharing, and the atmosphere (despite the crowds) is very romantic.

Gotta say, I love Chelsea's Kitchen.   It's sparse and loud, but the service is always good, and the food is excellent. Specifically, I think they may have the best veggie burger I've ever had. The tuna tacos are almost as good, when they're on the menu.  Speaking of things that aren't on the menu, they sometimes have a summer melon salad with almonds and avocado...holy sh*t, it's refreshing and delicious. But again, it's never on the menu and only available seasonally, so make sure you ask for it.  I go with Jenn H. all the time, and her favorite is the short ribs with the fried egg on top. Far from kosher, but extraordinary nonetheless. And for what it's worth, Chelsea's was featuring short ribs far before it became the standard of every hip eatery across the nation.  Overall this restaurant is a strong, consistent star. Plus it's open late...and you know I like that.

It's tempting to suggest, "an egg is just an egg". You hear that kind of thing a lot, and admittedly, there have been plenty of "legendary" breakfast places that have made me feel just that. Matt's Big Breakfast is not one of them.  What makes MBB unique is the quality of the food and the quality of the ingredients they use to make it. True, there menu is small, and when you read it, nothing particular will jump out at you , but that doesn't mean there's nothing special on it. For instace, everybody serves hashbrowns but these are without a doubt THE BEST hashbrowns I have ever had. The omlettes and eggs are great too.   No doubt, Matt's serves five-star food. It only loses a star because it's a little pricey and the wait is usually waaay too long. Maybe I shouldn't hold that against them, but I do...so get over it.   Also, their lunch is just average, and of course, they close far too early.

My friend KP loves this restaurant.  ...he's the guy who can clap 12 times in one second. Very impressive.   Anyway, he knows a thing or two about Mongolian Grill, and I have to agree with him on this one.   What's not to like about YC's? Who would hate on this place?  Affordable, tastey, comfortable, fast.   That KP clearly know what he's talking about.

To say I don't get the appeal of Chino Bandido would be an understatement.  I don't really need to say anything about this place...just look at the picture above! That's what the food looks like!  Need I really say more?  Well, I'm going to:  OK, so they serve both Mexican and Chinese food. SO WHAT? It's not even like they serve a hybrid of Mexican and Chinese food. You know, if they served Kung Pao enchiladas, that might be interesting, but this is just Chinese food and Mexican food next to eachother in the same aluminum takeout bowl (yes, even if you'e not taking out). Oh, and by the way, did I mention it's SHITTY Chinese and Mexican food.   That being said, if you love Panda Express, you might like the Chinese food at Chino Bandido. If you like super-over-fried, heartburn-enducing flavorless cardboard, you might like their Mexican food. And If you like using plastic silverware to try and cut through said cardboard as it sits in said aluminum take-out bowl while countless shirtless 10-year-olds drool over every dirty inch of your favorite restaurant, then this might just be your favorite restaurant.  On the plus side, they give you a free cookie.

This place is a lot of fun, and the food is delicious.  My only knock on it is that it's really crammed and really busy, which makes it a bit uncomfortable and hard to get in.   That being said, if you're not in a hurry, go with some friends, have a few of their wonderful sangrias and order lots of food. You'll have a blast.

Perfect place for a casual lunch or a quick dinner after a day of shopping. It's nothing special, but it's comfortable, tasty and affordable. Uncomplicated, high quality pizza and salads...plus the lasagna is pretty good too.

There's no shortage of options if you want Middle Eastern food in Tempe, especially around ASU. Luckily there's no confusion about which one is THE BEST.  Not only is this the best Middle Eastern retaurant in The Valley, it's also MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF TEMPE.   The chicken Shwarma is delicious, and the hummus is the best in the state. For a cheap meal, try the "hommus deluxe" with chicken or lamb. It eats like a meal.   Tack on a delightful staff, and a comfortable atmosphere, and what you have is probably the most underrated restaurant in Arizona.  "Best hummus", "best Middle Eastern food", "best restaurant in Tempe", "most underrated"...I know, that's a lot of superlatives - this place deserves each one.

To date, the best sushi I've had in AZ, bar none.  Fresh and delicious.   The rest of the Japanese menu is just as extraordinary, and the staff is helpful friendly and welcoming. Not too stuffy either!  Overall, one of the very elite restaurants in Arizona.

Boba tea is my favorite addiction, and this is by far my favorite place in AZ to get it. I travel from downtown Phoenix regularly just to get my fix, and on my way I pass several other options that don't even compare.   There are a lot of great flavors to choose from at The Boba Tea House, but I would suggest the standard "boba tea with boba". Don't be freaked out by the tapioca at the bottom. It's sort of an acquired taste, but once you get into it, it's a beautiful and obsession.

You know those places that refer to themselves as Chicago or New York "favorites", but people from those cities have never actually heard of them?  Well , being a Chicago native, I can tell you that Rosati's was not necessarily one of my "favorites", but it IS a place at which real Chicagoans eat, and it's pretty good!  Not great, and frankly not even as good as the Rosati's in Chicago, but it's still a cheap and easy way to beam yourself out to the midwest for an hour or so.  Stick with the thin crust pizza. Although Chicago is mostly known for it's deep dish, thin crust pizza cut in squares like ths one is actually what most Chicagoans eat on an every day basis.  When people argue about "Chicago pizza" vs. "New York pizza" I always think they should use the thin crust pizza rather than the eep dish. It's much more easily comparable.   Don't get me wrong, Chicago deep dish pizza is one of the country's greatest delicacies, but it's moe than just pizza, and for that reason it really can't be considered in the same conversation ith other pizza from around the country, or even around the world.   Why did I just go off on that tangent? No idea...has very little to do with Rosati's.

Probably the best all-around every-day restaurant in Phoenix. It offers all 4 points: good food, great price, healthy choices, and fast service.   And for those of us who live in downtown Phoenix...We finally have a place that stays open more than 20 hours a week! Thank you God, for giving us Pei Wei!   And to all those other establishments in the downtown area that are only open Monday - Friday 11am-3pm, let Pei Wei be an example to you. There are people living down here, and we will come out and eat at restaurants that offer good food at good prices and stay open!!!

I was a little dissapointed with the new Pischke's.   Admittedly I was never a huge fan of the original, so maybe I'm not the most qualified to post the first review.   The menu was pretty limited. I had the mozzeralla and tomato sandwhich with soup. The soup was cold. The sandwhich was boring.   Maybe I made a mistake by not going with the burger or pastrami sandwhich (both looked really good), but nothing I had made much of an impression. The service was nice, but overall the concept seemed pretty uninspired.

Pretty damn good.   The salads are pretty average, and so was the gnocchi, but they call it "Pizza a Metro" because they're known for their pizza...and the pizza is delicious.   I'd go with the vegetarian, I thought it was a lot better than the margarita, which was also pretty good.   Did I mention the people were really cool? They are, and that's important. Plus the bread they give you at the beginning of the meal is awesome.  Let's face the real facts here: You can come to a Metro with some friends and get a really good downtown meal for under $10 a person. What more can you ask for?

If you haven't seen the Phoenix Neutrino Project yet, you're a stupid person.   The Neutrino Project is an improvised movie created by three troupes of improvisors right there in front of the audience. I could get into the details of how they do it, but I'd much rather just encourage you to go see it yourself. It's never the same, it's always entertaining, and it's honestly one of the most unique artistic experiences you'll ever be a part of.   And if the show itself isn't enough, hang around afterward. The cast  is always lingering outside after each performance (usually slurping up a few beers), and they're very approachable and easy to interact with. If you ask one of them which one "likes melons" you'll have a new group of friends for life.  Anyway, if you get a chance, there's a show once a month at Space 55 in downtown Phoenix (7th street and Pierce). You should really check it out...I mean, you don't want to walk around your whole life being stupid.
