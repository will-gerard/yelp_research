Fantasia Crystals and Northern Winds have a great selection of everything. You can find a large selection of stones, statues, incense, totems, metaphysical books, essential oils, tools for rituals, etc. I go in every few weeks to buy incense and usually leave with a few new gemstones. They are constantly getting new inventory.  The staff is all super knowledgeable and ready and willing to help. I've interacted with everyone. They remember their regulars and they treat you like family.  In fact, I went in one day to ask for some metaphysical advice and Beth spent a good amount of time assessing the situation and walking me through various ways to help solve the problem. And it worked :)  This is a great shop!

The dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly.  The volunteers in kitty city were another story.  I've never had people make me feel like less than a human being than I did there.  A human being who came ready to adopt this afternoon had one of the cat volunteers given me the time of day.  I'm really sad cause I am a cat lover and our cat died in November.  The dog people were so nice I thought for sure kitty city would be the same.  I fell in love with a kitten in minutes but the attendants gave me either funny looks or completely ignored me for a family that was still looking around.  The service here broke my heart.  They are doing such a great service for animals, but I didnt feel welcome.  I'll have to find someplace else to go.

Fantastic service! I lost my car keys and my insurance company sent Gabriel. He was professional, friendly, and quick. I had two keys made for a reasonable price.

So these guys are pretty awesome!  My car was misfiring.  The first place I took it to said it was just my o2 sensor...it wasn't.  The second place was going to charge me upwards of $500 just for the diagnostics.  Ron quoted me a reasonable price to perform the diagnostic tests.  They also charged a reasonable price for labor and gave me a list of the other work I need to eventually have done.  These guys are honest and fast.  I'll be going back to them for sure.

They're great! I mean I was already a fan of them being a no kill shelter. The service was fantastic. A little over a year ago, we went in ready to adopt and asked about this sweet puppy who was super active and playful in her cage. The volunteer told us she wasn't ready, but he was happy to check the breed for me. He took some time to find her papers and it turned out she was ready to go home. We met her, but had a few other dogs to see so he kept her paperwork until we made a decision. We adopted the pup The process was simple and quick.   The only thing is I wish they'd do better checks on adopters. While I was paying some drugged up looking woman was returning a beautiful blue nose pitbull she'd adopted earlier in the day because he didn't like cats. Poor pup. I'm from New York where they perform an hour long interview to assess your suitability for adoption.  Either way, this is the best pet shelter I've been to in Phoenix.
