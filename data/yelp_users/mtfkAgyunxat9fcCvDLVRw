I've been looking forward to checking this place out for a while, and it did not disappoint.  We had to say good bye to family at the airport, and so wanted a decadent distraction to followup the sadness.  Fancy phosphates and floats served us nicely! You know how classic diners and decor are trendy now, and places are trying to make their restaurants look like they came through a time machine?  Well, this place is the real deal--an authentic 1920's soda shop, now surrounded by a vintage shop (it used to be a drug store).  The place is just wonderful to walk into.   Our waitress was unbelievably friendly.  You could tell that the 50's look for her was not just an act--it was her life.  Not only was she friendly, but fast as well.  From the menu, I tried a kiwi phosphate, a tiger's blood (cherry/coconut) Italian soda, tuna sandwich on sourdough, Navy bean soup, and a float to top it off.  All was delicious.  The tuna was not flooded in mayo and was the fattest tuna sandwich I've ever had.  The cole slaw on the side was also a bit dry (little mayo), which to me, is a wonderful thing.  A little pineapple acted to enhance the flavor further.  I am persnickety about slaw, but this I liked.  The drinks were deliciously fizzy.  For desert, we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake bunt cake.  Moments later, the waitress came back to tell us that sadly, she did not have a piece big enough to sell to us, but that there was a small piece left that she could simply give to us for free.  We agreed and added a float for good measure.  The float was pistachio ice cream and amaretto soda.  Unbelievable!  Hands down the best float I've ever had.  And I love that the spoons come in a shot glass of even more soda.  That way, when you eat some of the ice cream, you can add more soda.  Brilliant!  Oh, and the free piece of bunt cake?  It turned out to be the size of a normal piece of cake, but for free.  And it too was delicious. The stores that flank the restaurant served as a good distraction while walking off a few of the hundreds and hundreds of calories consumed.   The only real problem was coming down from the sugar high about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson.   I will be back.  And next time, I'm going to be crazy and try the "dill pickle" phosphate.

It's official, and worth an update--the dill pickle phosphate is way too potent for anyone except the greatest of pickle freaks.  That said, I cannot recommend more strongly, the dill pickle sundae.  Yeah, I know, it sounds like there's no way that would work.  But it does!  The flavor is dominated by the vanilla ice cream with a slight and somewhat lingering hint of dill.  It really does work.  Ok, I admit it might not be for everyone, but try it.  Really. And if not, still, swing by this wonderful little slice of Americana if you find yourself up in Phoenix.  What a wonderful little place!

Oh I am spoiled with the small-town feel of Tucson International--now if they wold only get some quality flights!! I've never flown out of Sky Harbor.  Seems like any other large-scale airport on the surface. So why only two stars?  The driving around to find where to park is horrible.  They need to remember that most people don't frequent the airport.  So they should be obvious and deliberate with the signage.   Also, the elevator from the parking garage to the terminals is a little confusing.  It literally went from floor 3, to 2, to B, to A, to 1.  Alpha-numerics embedded within themselves?  Again, keep it simple for us dummies who don't live the commuter jet-set lifestyle.

Made my way up to Phoenix and Tempe last night for the rare visit and stopped by Four Peaks for the first time.  I'd had their 8th St. Ale and Kilt Lifter prior to the visit, but was looking forward to sampling a few of their other beers.  All were excellent.  The oatmeal stout was delicious, even to this self-proclaimed "hophead".  It appears that they have a couple different IPAs on tap regularly--the Raj, which is an English style and the Hop Knot which is the more traditional, florally over-hopped American version.  That was the way to go in my opinion!  They also had a seasonal called Double Knot--a double IPA.  Absolutely delicious and potent at 9.1% abv without killing the hoppiness with an overly alcoholic taste--a difficult thing to pull off with a double IPA in my opinion.  Also had dinner on the front patio while there.  I had fish and chips.  Fairly standard for pub fare as far as I was concerned although I did really like the chips, which were really just very nicely seasoned thick fries.  The new Nimbus in Tucson has set the standard to me for the fish portion, and this did not top that.  Still tasty though and a fair portion.  A friend of mine got the salmon BLT, which looked quite tasty. On a Thursday night, the place was packed.  But there was still a fair amount of room to get to the bar for a drink while waiting for a table, which really only took about 10 minutes (we were told the wait would be 15-20).  We sat outside on a nice patio that runs the length of the front of the bar.  Heaters are abundant for those chilly AZ february nights.:)   If there was a parking lot, I missed it.  There's on-street parking however, but you might have to walk a few blocks once you find a vacant spot. Wait staff was young, friendly, and energetic, but not overbearing.  They gave us our space while we had our meals. The interior is huge, nicely decorated, and clearly a brewery when you make your way towards the back.  Plenty of seating, plenty of room to stand as well. For those who want to take home some "souvenirs", they do sell beer by the growler (as well as provide refills after the initial bottle purchase).  It looks like they also run the gambit on "Four Peaks" clothing as well. Overall, a great place to visit, but if you're from out of town, watch carefully--the turn onto 8th St. is easy to miss.

I went to Ikea with expectations of simply being overwhelmed.  While I wasn't too far off about that, I was also pleasantly surprised at what I didn't expect.   1) Food--wow, I will come hungrier next time.  Neat food items at ridiculously low prices. 2) Knick knacks--I had no idea Ikea had such a great selection of tiny items to finish off any room.  Great deals found included a reading lamp and a stainless steel dish drying rack. 3) Finished rooms as displays--it's refreshing to actually see what some furniture items would look like in an actual home room. 4) No bags--yes!  America needs to be weened from it's obsession with disposable plastic bags.  Be warned--this store will knock you off cold turkey.  Bring your own bags (preferably cloth reusable) and save yourself the stress. It's a drive from Tucson, but I could see a yearly trek to Ikea being worth it.

Does it deserve only 3 stars?  Maybe.  But if you're a kid at heart, which I am, or if you have kids, then this is a jewel in the furnace of the greater Phoenix area. The place is expensive.  But if you are paying full price then you didn't do your homework--there appear to be deals for admission all over the place from what I've seen.  As for the size:  I was expecting it to be far smaller than it actually was.  I really was pleasantly surprised.  No, it's not the Boston Aquarium.  But really, it's not your grandmother's fish tank either.  There's plenty to see with many exotic creatures.  There's touch-zones where you can see what starfish feel like.  There's a movie theater, which was playing a Spongebob movie when I was there.  There's even a play zone for the kids.  And of course, there's the obligatory "exit through the gift shop".  I managed to get through there with the most minimal of purchases. The pros:  The underwater tunnel through the main tank; the pop-outs in numerous tanks where you can sneak in from bellow and be surrounded by the tank's inhabitants; the abundance of puffer fish! The cons:  The price; the fact that it is connected to a mall (although this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be); the giant crab tanks really need to be bigger; informational signs on who's in what tanks are often ambiguous. The rumor:  The main tank is being outfitted to house a sea turtle some time in the near future. Overall, don't go here expecting an aquarium like you'd find in Boston or Newport.  If you're excited to see some neat fish in a well managed aquarium, you likely won't be disappointed.
