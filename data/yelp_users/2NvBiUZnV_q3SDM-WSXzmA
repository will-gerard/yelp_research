My boyfriend and I were in the area, wanted to try something new, scoped it out on YELP. Thought it would be good because the reviews were good. Only one menu off to the side in the whole place. One girl was working, no greeting, went up and asked her about a menu item and could have cared less. She didn't ask if it was our first time or try to help in any way, was tossing things around, must have hated her job. Could barely hear her when asking the type of bean or rice we wanted. Absolutely would not come here again. The impression from just the employee not having any sort of customer service skills was enough for me to not want to come back. The food was decent, had a salad and nothing to write home about. You can just go to Chipotle and get the customer service and good food.

This place is amazing! The sushi is displayed in a spectacular manner!  The catepillar roll looks so realistic with its cream cheese eye balls :) Fresh and yummy ingredients! Service is great AND there is a DJ in the kitchen too, after 9:00 it's like a club!

This is the salon to come to! It is so clean, the ladies are professional and so good at what they do. The hairdryers come down from the ceiling and their product smells so amazing from shampoo to leave in conditioner. I feel there leaving like a new woman!
