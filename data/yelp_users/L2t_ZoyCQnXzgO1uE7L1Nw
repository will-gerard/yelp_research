Very solid Thai place. I have the fried spring rolls, which was good (crispy flaky crust, but the filling wasn't anything to write about), the vegetarian tom yum soup (pretty good, but honestly I've had better tasting broth), and the winter curry.  The curry was interesting, but the kabocha squash (which i'm a fan of) didn't seem to fit in right with the curry.  The curry itself was good and the dish was a good effort.  My gf had the vegetarian pad thai.  She thought it was good, but a little too soupy (too much fluid).  Also, they offer most things spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10.  They said 5 is good, but I tasted almost no spice.  I'd go for a 10 next time.  From what I read this places is among the best in Pitt, and I can see how this might be true.  Next time I'm in Pitt, I'll definitely consider coming back.

Overall very impressed with Pittsburgh brunch!  The menu looks amazing Great selection of omelets.  The french toast my friend had was amazing.  Unfortunately my cassoulet wasn't what I really expected, but otherwise a great experience.  Check it out for yourself!   Notes from my visit:  Biscuits and sweet potato with jalape√±o butter - pretty good  Carrot orange ginger juice - a bit heavy on the carrot, but if that's what you're looking for.  Cassoulet, sunny side up - I was hoping for more of this dish, but there were too many ingredients going on to really stand out as an overall dish.

Yummy, the crepe hotcakes were delicious!  I got the "Morning After" which is two eggs, sausage and crepe hot cakes.  I was told this is a must go to in Pittsburgh and I have to agree.  I was stuffed after this.  My gf got the veggie omelet and she said it was so so.  It's all about the crepe's here really.

Duck club is legit.  Roasted duck, applewood bacon, red wine tomato jam, aoli.  The Mine That Bird cocktail is strong but delicious  I'll be back

They offered original and honey dew.  Honey dew tasted right, but I felt like original.  I bought original with strawberries, taste is up to par.  It's not self serve and the price for a small was 2.99, one topping for 99 cents, 3 for $1.49.  Too expensive for what it is.  It's more expensive than Maryland / DC prices.  Probably worth going to a cheaper place as there are no real benefits for the price.

Stopped by here for lunch.  Got the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie.  Savory, scrumptuous, complex.  Sorta like a chicken pot pie, but with a twist.  Also got the fresh orange juice, which was on point.  The ambience is probably the best part, it's open market style.  Felt like being in Portland or something.
