Sushi was sub par. Sloppy roles and warm fish. The guy making the sushi came up to the bar where I was sitting and freaked out because I asked him to change the channel on the tv. He said, "I'm too busy for you." I don't think he spent that extra time on my food.   Not coming back to this place, although it's the closest sushi to work.

The Picasso exhibit was a nice distraction from the Vegas craziness. We went early afternoon on a Thursday and there wasn't much of a crowd inside. We were able to enjoy the exhibit without feeling rushed and the audio guide helped a lot.   The exhibit seemed a lot smaller than the advertised amount, only because some of the paintings were part of a series and it showed the same piece develop over time.   They offered a discount for M life members and at $16, it was was a great break from the craps table.

The food is above average but the service is not the best. There isn't an assigned server just random people coming up to you. They are nice but they all seemed really busy running credit cards batches and taking care of the business side that they never came back to check on me or give me more water. I'd come back but expect more of a fast food feel to the service.
