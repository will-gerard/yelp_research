LOVE Saba's, it's one of our favorite restaurants. It's a small hole in the wall greek place, seems family run, great menu and really affordable. The gyros and platters are SO good and the hummus is the best I've ever had. The staff is fabulous, always friendly, fast service! This place is good for lunch or dinner.

Love this place, great Thai food. We ordered Panang, Egg Rolls, Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai. Everything was amazing except the Pad Thai. They use really thin noodles, which I've not seen before. It wasn't my favorite, but everything else was delicious. I would definitely go back!

I don't get all the bad reviews here. This is the closest bagel shop to my house, I've been about 5x. Same experience every time, they are always quick, good/friendly service and the manager is very nice and helpful. For a chain bagel store I think this is as good as it gets, no they aren't NY bagels, but we aren't in NY are we! I've got no qualms with this Einstein Bros!

We love WCG, it's our old standby. Always consistent, good food. The desserts (obviously) are insanely good. The bread pudding is the best I have ever had. My husband usually gets the ribs, he loves them and I've gotten the chicken fingers (so good), SW egg rolls, chicken madera (so good) and the WCG salad which I love. It's a nice atmosphere, low lights and very clean. They have happy hour in the bar area with a special menu, not sure what time it starts, but it ends at 6PM.

Solid Northern Indian food, this is one of the only Indian restaurants in our area, so we were happy to stumble upon some good Indian food. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Rogan Josh, Naan and Veggie Samosas, all were delish! This place is also good for carry out, they have a lunch buffet we have not tried, full bar and also work with a few delivery services such as Door Dash and Eat24. If you're in the area and craving Indian it's worth a stop!

I honestly have no idea how this alrline is still in business. They pride themselves on cheap flights and 24/7 customer service.  1. The flights are NEVER cheaper, they nickle and dime you for every single item. I have never paid less that $350 for a ticket.  2. Their website sucks. You can't do anything online so you are forced to call their customer service number where you will be on hold for AT LEAST one hour. 3. The only thing keeping these guys in business is the fact that they fly direct from smaller airports. That is the ONLY reason I ever fly them and everytime I dread it and question if it is even worth it.  If I could give them negative stars I really would. Their Facebook page has disabled reviews, I wonder why!!!!!! Hate you very much, Katrina

We went here based on a recommendation from FRIENDS and I have to say it was not a good experience. The food was subpar at best and the service was AWFUL. I honestly think there was something wrong with our waiter, he was extremely slow in more than one way and that's putting it nicely. First we were seated in a booth that was so small I felt claustrophobic, we asked to be seated at a table and that was fine. A few minutes later another couple were seated at that booth, she could barely fit, like her chest was actually resting on the table top and not by choice. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Rogan Josh, we asked for both of them to be mild, they were both so spicy my husband couldn't eat it. Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised to hear they served Pellegrino, I was brought back down to earth when they brought it out warm and served it with ice. I never understand why restaurants do this. IT'S SPARKLING WATER, when warm and mixed with ice it turns flat almost immediately. All in all we had a horrible experience, unfortunately the owners have no idea how to run a business. I wanted to give them feedback about the Pellegrino as that's an easy fix, but by the time the meal was done we figured it would be pointless and we we're probably right.

One question.  W T F ?  1. I am only giving this hotel two stars because we had prepaid online and ended up needing to cancel our second/last night and the manager refunded us no questions asked.  2. This is not a boutique hotel people, so please stop calling it that. It is VERY confusing. This is seriously an old Holiday Inn that they gave a major makeover. That is all. There is no restaurant, the bar is not even closet to trendy, the pool is not luxurious, there is nothing unique or full service about this hotel.   3. The room appears to be fine at first look, but the bathrooms are tiny and the beds and pillows are not comfortable. The furnishings tried to be modern, but it's like comparing IKEA to Horchow. Basically, we were not expecting the Four Seasons, but were definitely not expecting the Holiday Inn Express.   4. This has been my most confusing YELP moment ever. It has been given 4 stars on other review sites as well. The only thing I can figure is that a lot of people are quickly passing through for work and it's fine for one night. You aren't expecting a lively, trendy, fun atmosphere.   5. One plus - free wifi.

The rooms are lovely and cheap! We had a room Saturday night and we got it for $99. I will say the walls are the thinnest I have ever experienced, but for the price I can't complain. The roomservice is great, 24 hours and they also have a lot of restaurants and a few different bars/1 club you can go to. It's a nice one night getaway from Tucson.  Oh yeah....and you can gamble and play poker..lol. My bf plays Texas Holdem there and I do the electronic roulette. It's alright!

Food was awesome, staff seemed awesome minus our waitress that was a frazzled mess the entire night. She was nice, but forgot everything and was extremely slow. Def one of the nicer, better restaurants at Wild Horse Pass Casino.

After reading all the great reviews I decided to make my 82 year old grandmother an appointment at Focal Point. I called and specifically asked for someone who knew how to do older women's hair, she wanted a cut and style. You know the style, short and curly - grandma hair. They recommended Chrissy. Though Chrissy was very sweet, she had no idea what she was doing. $84 later my grandmother left with a mop on her head. Extremely short and STRAIGHT hair, she wasn't picking up on the clue's my grandma was putting out either. We immediately went to another salon, had to get it recut and styled. The new stylist was so shocked, she showed me chunks of the most uneven hair I've ever seen. Honestly the worst experience we've had at a salon, sadly we won't be back.

Where do I start?   We purchased our new home at the end of last year, based on Yelp reviews I had Eduardo come out to give me an estimate for a yard clean up. $600 later the yard looked much better and he assured me all my plants had irrigation and that we would wait to Spring to begin yard service.   Spring approached and he came out again to do some work on my irrigation, much more affordable than some of the larger companies I called. Later I realized all my aloe plants were turning brown and the centers of the plants had died. I had Eduardo come back out where he informed me those plants did not have irrigation, obviously annoyed, he added the irrigation to them (the center of the plants never came back, they are still dead, the outter leaves are starting to come back and turn green). I also stated that I wanted my grass to be green, it was very brown. He said they would fertilize it, etc. to get it going.   Later we started yard service with KO's, mainly because I thought his prices were good ($65 every other week) and they provided decent service even though it was clear there were some communication issues. By this point Summer was approaching, my plants were blooming and flowering, things looked great, but my yard was still brown. Turns out they never did the fertilizer, once I inquired, he said they would need to up the water/irrigation on the yard because of the heat and that they would in fact fertilize. This did help, but I was bothered because I feel like my lawn service should be telling me these things in foresight, not telling me they would work on it and not following through or waiting for me to notice the problem and then them backtracking. Also, they were supposed to reseed the lawn and completely missed that window, so I still have big patches in my yard where no grass will grow, apparently I'll have to wait til the Fall for this.   When things were starting to look nicely, plants flowering, etc. one day I come home and everything had been cut back. I called him and stated I NEVER wanted the flowers trimmed off or cut back. Fast forward one month, finally blooming again, I come home and they were all cut off again. I was not happy. Everyone else in my neighborhood had blooms, but us. Now here I am having to wait another month for flowers.  There were other issues, the crew not coming on the right day, leaving my pool a mess with debris, Eduardo telling me he would come on a certain day or time and not showing. We also had an issue with a potted plant. They were supposed to plant a palm in a particular place (centered), Eduardo actually placed the pot where the plant was supposed to go and his guys planted it a foot to the right. We literally pulled it out of the ground and replanted it in the correct place, I will say they did not charge us for that which I appreciated.  Bottom line, KO's biggest problem is the communication. There is none, you can speak to Eduardo, but half the time he forgets and you have to remind him or it doesn't translate correctly to his crew, or a completely different crew comes out the next time and has no idea. I want my lawn service to be proactive, someone that tells me what needs to be done, not me asking them all the time and having to play catch up. If your plants and grass are dying when you have lawn service something is wrong.   I have now started with a new guy, recommended by a friend and I have to say it's the same price, even less for fixes on the irrigation, etc. and it is NIGHT AND DAY. He was here 3x longer than KO's and got EVERY weed, it's perfection honestly and he knows not to cut off my flowers and to let me know if something needs attention before it starts dying, etc. which I obviously appreciate!

What can I say I am a complete sucker for a protein style hamburger, add onion from In-N-Out! I love that I can stay low carb even when on a road trip in a desperate situation. Arizona is a big state! Thanks In-N-Out, you're the only fast food place I will go to!

We recently tried Nori and had a really good meal. The atmosphere is nice, cool bar area and an outdoor patio section. They have a decent drink menu and lots of yummy rolls. We had the baked lobster roll and the crunchy roll, both SO GOOD! For sushi this is one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood, they got the food and ambiance right!

Went based of Yelp reviews and got a win. It's a total (BYOB!!!) hole in the wall, but very clean and 100% authentic, only one person spoke English and that's exactly how I like my Asian. We ordered the Beef PHO and the coconut chicken and beef, both were amazing and let me tell you the bill was $15, we left a $15 tip.

I love Nekter, it's one of my favorite juice bars, though I go for the acai bowls and smoothies. It isn't cheap, but the smoothes and acai are the best!

My grandmother has been in town for the Winter and likes Penny's. I have to say I would give this place one star if not for Valentino, he does a good job. My issue with this place is the front desk staff. I have never seen anything like it. They get the appointment completely wrong or  change the appt. on us last minute every single time. Just yesterday they called to change her appt. from 11:45AM to 1PM due to "a timing conflict." They also claimed we had a scheduled a standing Tuesday appointment through June, which makes no sense because she is leaving in March. They are just so unorganized and all around nightmare customer service, I would not recommend this salon to anyone especially for the price, $35-50 for a haircut.

Wow, I was so impressed by this shop! As other reviewers said, it is very organized a HUGE! They have everything from clothes to strollers, cribs, toys, bouncers, small furniture and maternity clothes. I'm not sure why they are falling under the $$$ on Yelp, it's definitely not expensive, I would say $$ max. I got 7 perfect condition items today for $25, my items ranged from $2-6 each. They also had a 10 for $10 onesie section. They have sales often and give you a frequent shopper stamp card. I will so be back here and often!

I really like this place! It's a great spot for a loungey drink indoors or on the patio, they have pretty good food and great service. I love the vibe and they have heat lamps and blankets if it gets too cold. One of my favorite places for cocktails and the decor is fabulous!

I love living across the street from a Dutch Bros! Great, friendly staff, amazing coffee and a drive-thru. There is always a line, but it moves quick. You can also go to the window and order.  I love their mochas and freezes! They also do a punch card, I've gotten at least 6 free coffees! Can't beat it!

Honestly, we wanted to love this place and like the other lower reviews we agree it was subpar BBQ. Based on the rave reviews I guess our expectations were too high. My husband had the BBQ ribs ($14 for a 1/4 slab) as well as the Schmikey sandwich ($6 served with a pickle spear). On the positive note he really liked the brisket sandwich, but said the ribs and sauce they used were just OK. I ordered the basic pork sandwich, we also got a side of slaw, fries and mac and cheese. The pork sandwich was OK, but really saucey and all the sides were extremely bland as many of the other reviews said. I also had an Orange Fanta in a glass bottle that was flat. I can tell they are trying hard and I wish them luck, but we won't be back. I've had much better BBQ for the price and for the people saying this is the best BBQ they have ever had I feel bad for them! On a final note we were there for probably 40 minutes and when we got home my hair smelled like a camp fire. I just can't, semi scared to post this review as I've seen the owner leaving some not so nice comments on other people's negative reviews, but here goes nothing.

We tried Tottie's for carryout last night and it was delicious! The packaging was perfect, everything wrapped up well and neat. We ordered egg rolls (4), beef panang and pad thai, asked for it mild and they delivered. I was really impressed. They don't have the liquor license yet, but are working on it. As soon as they get it we will definitely be joining them for a meal in the restaurant. Great neighborhood addition!
