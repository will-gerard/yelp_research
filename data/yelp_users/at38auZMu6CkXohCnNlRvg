My wife and I had the pleasure of enjoying the Large Philly Steak is fairly lean and tender, thinly sliced, griddle fried with olive oil, splashed with onions and topped with a solid amount of tasty melted white American cheese in a 10" Italian Bread roll along with an order of crunchy and tasty French fries.  Touted as the best in Arizona, and although enjoyably tasty and fresh, in my opinion (for what it's worth) it comes just slightly short of what one would call a true Philly! The diner-like eatery is clean, nicely arranged with both indoor and outdoor seating, as well as great personal attention, allowing for a comfortable and gratifying quick lunch.  As one to have had Phillies from across the country, including its hometown of Philadelphia, and can understand variations on the Philly theme, I tend to be a traditionalist in the sense that if a Philly Cheese Steak is not traditionally prepared, it should be called a 'Philly-Style' Cheese Steak!  I rationalize this statement under the same pretense just as I have reviewed and written about the traditional 'Cuban Sandwich'.  Despite Best of Philly's derivation, it is, within reason, a very, very good sandwich.  Regrettably, nowhere on their menu do they offer the 'real' thing which undoubtedly would include the deli roast beef of rib eye or occasionally top round steak griddled and chopped into virgin olive oil, afforded melted provolone cheese, with preferences like of pepper, sautéed onions, mayo, mushrooms, maybe some hot sauce, along with salt, pepper, and/or ketchup, and it would be too costly to fly in the bread from PA... don't get me wrong though, we're not in Philly and this is the closest to a real Philly I've run across in Phoenix - keep it up guys, we'll be back for more.  Bon appétit!

Whether you're a fan or not of the nature in the great outdoors, the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix will awe you into enjoyment! Nature lovers will love the way the gardens are both laid out and naturally set. The incredible access in its layout allow both convenience and access to every section, without encroaching on the beauty beheld here. The staff and structures as well as the complete package are worth every penny paid to enter, and then some. This is the place to visit while in Phoenix if you are sincerely interested in getting to know the southwestern natural environment in a one stop setting. Don't miss Gertrude's Restaurant for not only good food, but special events and regularly scheduled local artists performing. And, throughout the year, special events are fantastic. Our favorite is the Luminarias during the month of December, celebrating the Holiday Season with incredible lighting of the scenery and musical ensembles in multiple locations throughout the facility. In Phoenix, ya gotta go to DBG, it's always incredible.

This your typical Burger King fast food joint with their regular brand menu and special offerings. As an occasional junk food eater I've over the years dutifully tried everything on their menu at least once. This is one location that stands out in the general area of very good - in general.  So as to make it easy to gauge each of these eateries, when I do try them, I've devised a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being outright down and dirty nasty, and 5 being the best a fast food joint can be! I gage: cleanliness; service; product quality and consistency; convenience; accessibility; taste and the personnel's attitude and customer service level. This place scores 4.0 of 5. I may come back here and do recommend it!

Although wanting to visit the Phoenix Art Museum since making Phoenix our new home, I was drawn to visit as not to miss an opportunity to experience the Andy Warhol Exhibit.  That exhibit was not a letdown, neither was the Museum as a whole!  I was amazed at the size and scope of the institution and its fabulous array of art work on display.  The institution has an amazing array of activities abound, depending on how much time you desire to spend there.  They offer lectures and talks, varying and changing exhibitions, a fabulously amazing restaurant for this venue, and an enviable layout conducive to the admiration of incredible works that include American and Southwestern art to Contemporary and Latin American showings.  My only recommendation to those who wish to enjoy Masterworks from American, Latin American, European and Asian paintings and/or sculpture and even fashion, is to visit their website to best plan your formidable and enjoyable visit.  This is a must visit when in the Valley of Sun!

Having the opportunity to regularly travel by air and auto across and occasionally outside the country, not a professional hotel reviewer by any means, and not a regular business traveler - but as a primarily pleasure and needs traveler, I have developed as what I believe is a concise a method for measuring the worthiness of each airport visited.  My criteria are: 1) ease of access to and from public or private ground transportation [Score:4.0]; 2) convenient and safe parking [Score:4.2]; 3) access, accuracy and convenience of check in and check out [Score:5.0]; 4) atmosphere, ambience, public facilities, lounging areas and access to an office center and Wi-Fi [Score:4.0]; 5) overall customer service - including but not limited to Hospitality, Support Services, concierge knowledge, communication, attitude and demeanor [Score:5.0]; 6) quality, cleanliness, value, convenience, amenities and comfort of rooms, beds, room safe [Score:4.5]; Taking all the aforementioned categories, I've devised a scale of 1 star to 5 stars with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best a hotel can be! This hotel rates a: 4.45.  Most positive point(s) at this airport are: the Griffin Club services and amenities and the Revive Spa services .  Most negative points here are: the distance from city center.

As an overall fan of B&N everywhere, I must say this one is very nice.  Great coffee and goodies to compliment a book lovers atmosphere.

Usually when deciding on a first time visit to an eatery, especially to an ethnic cuisine, regardless of its status and published reviews, one hopes for the best, and expects the worst!  The anxiety was totally unwarranted for our first visit to the Thai House.  This very unassuming little restaurant in typical suburbia packs a positive wallop in all things culinary.  Whether you're into Thai food or not, overall the place is nicely appointed, clean, comfortable and the service was better than could ever be expected.  This little gem generally hits the spot, but they've taken to heart A focus on few very good, as opposed to many OK dishes.  These folks are to be commended for their offerings, manner and hospitality with which they approach and serve each patron!

Great, if you like loud and congested... Maybe?  I've noted in other reviews that I'm not all that keen on sports bars, but I must say, although not concretely impressed with the first time visited, it's a few steps up that your typical TV-swamped pubs! The beers are good and cold - can't mess that up, but some of their eats fall short. I was especially unenthusiastic with their "Bottle Caps" (thinly sliced Jalapeños and batter fried). Really, really cold Draught Blue Moon and a well-chilled Angry Orchard.  I categorize much there other offerings as pretty much standard fare. Seeing some of their eats from afar though, I will be coming back to try some of their other good looking samplings.  Like other similar venues, it's very noisy during peak hours (one of my issues with sports bars). Cozy and crowded inside, smoky and crowded outside.  But if you do like sports bars, this local watering hole is great for some loud drinking and talking. Another bar recommended to the die-hard sports/eats/scream crowd!

My wife and I have frequented many a fabulous Applebee's across the country and have always been fascinated by their ability to offer very good food, great atmosphere and some of the best service of any chain eatery around.  Something really wrong seems to have happened at this location. Food was just okay, and the service atrocious.  With multiple tables clear and available we were told there was a twenty minute wait.  When asking about the tables that were clean and clear, we were told they were reserved - at Applebee's? Another family ahead of us, made the decision to go next door to IHOP!  We eventually did something we've never done before, we confiscated one of the various empty tables.  By the time dinner came around, we found the servings were adequate, but the taste and apparent quality of our fare was less than noteworthy!  At this visit we tried the Club Grill Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries which was nothing to write home about, and the Fish & Chips with French Fries.  As a traditional Fish & Chips lover, and often ordered at Applebee's, I found the fish and its batter was considerably bland, unlike many others I've enjoyed over the years in many another Applebee's.  Although the server was nice and very apologetic for the inconvenience, and the on duty manager also apologized, we found the incident very discomforting and aggravating to experience from what usually has been a favorite. Hopefully this a one-off incident, but it may take a long time before I frequent this Applebee's again. Consommateurs d'être prudents.

Come on Pirates!  Joint has potential, freezer case fries are tolerable, but the over-fried/battered tasteless Mrs. Paul's wanabe is not worth the price nor the visit.  After getting my order, reluctantly wishing to enjoy this 'fishy' meal got worse with the totally filthy seating/eating area - dirty and grungy floors, grimy tables, unwiped doorway and a trash can you don't want to go near to put trash into!  Health department where are you?  If you don't believe me, see my pics.  My re-visiting this place is best described in the words of the Raven: 'nevermore'!

Pho Thanh's Restaurant menu shows a hearty variety Vietnamese eats, and their Vietnamese noodle soups Pho top the list. They offer many, many varieties, but in just one size each super reasonably priced and delicious.  My wife and I consider ourselves Pho connoisseurs, addicted to this fabulous warm comfort food from back east.  Being relative newcomers to the Phoenix Area, we have begun our Pho finding adventure of discovering the best the region has to offer.  After hitting a few local joints previously we've discovered how good Pho Thanh is!  The staff is prompt, accommodating, succinct and helpful - not to mention the huge dining area, its cleanliness and appealing environs.  Don't expect fine furniture, creative décor or table linens, as this is a neighborhood soup kitchen, but, til now, our fave for Pho!  My wife's favorite Pho Tái (Slices of rare eye-round steak) was tender and tasty. My all-time favorite, Pho Tái Nam (Slices of rare eye-round steak and well-done brisket) was exquisite with fascinating whiffs of aromas that scintillate ones palate and desire for the homey broth.  Not all Pho Joints are created equal.  Pho Thanh, unlike many other places locally, offers you all the amenities and condiments (other places make you ask for it - if they have it) fully required accoutrements to compliment and perfect the bowls of aromatic decadence. Their servings will include platters full of lime wedges, bean sprouts, jalapenos, fresh cilantro, along with a great table selection of add-ons!  If you're a devout Pho lover, or a novice looking to expand your horizons in the comfort food arena - Pho Thanh is for you.  We highly recommend them, and plan to continue enjoying their fab Viet foods beyond Pho!  Bon appétit!

Although having vaguely heard of Tapas Papa Fritas, and a connoisseur of excellent Spanish Cuisine - I didn't pay much attention to this eatery, I am very astonished to say, because of its name - Fried Potato Snacks!  Boy was I wrong!  Being of Spanish heritage, I was flabbergasted with Tapas Papa Fritas' traditional atmosphere, an atmosphere emitting Basque, Andalusian, Moorish, Castilian and Asturian regions feel, décor and food!  This appealing and large eatery smacks of being in Spain!  From being almost obscure in its external surroundings, once you step up the path to the front door, past the traditional-style plant-filled veranda, see their fabulous outdoor seating area, you have arrived to the old world of España!  Having grown up in a Spanish-Cuban atmosphere, I am well versed in the fare offerings, what I should anticipate both traditionally and in any nouveau prospects.  I was impressed and satisfied!  While absorbing the atmosphere, we were seated near a window whereby we had the opportunity to admire both the inside and outside, as we experienced a fine bottle of Pinetti Notte Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie 2014.  My wife and I were pleased to see some of the old-world as well as fine-dining traditions followed by our Server, Sina who showed his expertise in not only fine proper serving, but old-world rapport, pleasantry and knowledge.  Elegant service from table cloths, silverware and the use of an enoteca for wine.  As newcomers to the establishment, we decided to try something that would give us the widest array of samplings, so we started with their Tapas Deluxe Special which included: Gambas al Pil-Pil, Chorizo, Txistorra, Stuffed Dates, Queso Manchego, Chicken Skewer, and a Lamb Shank - all prepared and served to perfection.  And, just as is in the Old World, no rush... patience, enjoyment and privacy abound.  We then went for the main course.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed (I did too) her serving of Paella Valenciana in a traditional style with saffron rice, fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, tender chicken, extraordinary txistorra, peppers, onions, tomatoes and peas - beyond delectable it was!  I proceeded to have their incredible rendition of Conejo (Rabbit) Romescu Catalan-style, with a soft to the palate peppery tomato almond sauce over an excellent rendition of traditional saffron rice.  If you enjoy rabbit as I do, this dish is for you - amazing!  I believe it needless to say, by the end of our meal, we had no room for dessert of which they have a wonderful assortment of Spanish selections.  It is no wonder why this eatery has received the accolades it has on media, from critics and awards alike -the food, the atmosphere, the staff, the accoutrements and the vibe are magnificent.  Our profound kudos to Chef Joseph Gutierrez and his incredible art.  As unfortunately so many 'Traditional' Spanish in the Valley and across the country tend to do, sway to changing the great things which don't need changing from our past - the only nouveau here is the first time patron.  We look forward to visiting them as frequently as possible to get our taste buds wrapped around more of their fabulously authentic cuisine, Flamenco shows and live Latin music during the weekends.  Can't wait for the next visit.  Excellent ambience, service, hospitality and food - next time I'm going for my favorite: Zarzuela (Seafood Stew - some may know it as Spanish-style Bouillabaisse)!  Bon appétit!

Many times I preface my comments with a disclaimer that many gastronomes carve out negative reviews when they are dissatisfied in a fit of retribution, and those pleased won't spend the energy writing much, thus making many reviews somewhat slanted! I try to be even-handed, not holding back the negative, but try underscoring the positive - always my 'opinion' and those with me at the time.  Gertrude's falls into a peculiar category in my reviewing.  A restaurant that has achieved a well above average category in both foodie social media and professional critics alike place the demands of staff, management and chef to be on the ball all the time, and strive for the consistency that is appropriate to its accolades whether a main dish, soup, salad or sandwich.  That did not happen during our visit recently.  Gertrude's seems to strike me as an eatery that is trying to be a fine dining experience, without the dining experience!  Despite a reputation that under Chef Eldridge back in 2013 offered Gertrude a 3.5 of 5 on Howard Seftel's list - leaving aside his mention of and my agreeing with his "you-got-to-be-kidding" comment on his 'bread' issue, I agree across the board.  When you consider Yelp's 3.5 of 5, Open Table's 4 of 5, Zomato's 3.8 of 5 and Robrt Pela's tribute to new Chef Matt Taylor, we could not agree with such praises.  Upon arriving, you almost immediately are overwhelmed by the 'welcome tourist' mentality.  This is not an eatery you approach for both consistency or fine cuisine.  Ratings seem to boast extraordinary fare but they do not appear to pride themselves in giving the customer the best possible food experience, you just get the impression that the diner is there to be stiffed with exorbitant prices, for highly boasted dishes that are on par with much lower grade dining establishments - of which we have plenty in the Valley of the Sun.  This was a meal that was in no way worth bragging about for its value, originality, excellent taste, presentation or the overall dining experience.  As for the prices - you positively do not get what you pay for! Our experience with our high expectations for their Farmer's Soup was far too much cream with extraordinary blandness (salt and pepper please); the French Dip's beef was relatively tasteless, far from being tender with an undecipherable aioli and the au jus dip incredibly frail; and the Chicken Sandwich was nothing to write home about - my wife did not finish it!  Our recommendation - have a drink or two, maybe an appetizer.  If you're in a rush, they'll help you leave quickly - if you're not in a hurry, there's the Gift Shop, they won't rush you out of there! Bon appétit is not the word for Gertrude's!  Happy dining, el Gástro Ecléctico!

Perfect southwestern hospitality and yes it is an 'American' pub!  As many of my readers know, I'm not a Sports Bar fan, but since this is a Sports Pub, I gave it a chance.  A friend and I were out to grab some beers, a game and hopefully some traditional public house food. This unpretentious sports pub grabs you the moment you walk in. With its Saloon bar, café/diner look and wtw TVs with memorabilia combination, it is a great change of pace from the big box, run-of-the-mill so-called sports bars you'll find anywhere! Mike, the owner, and all his folks not only know hospitality and wear great smiles, with stupendous service, but have an incredible array of offerings! My Buddy ordered their Green Chili Burger with New Mexico Green Chilis, Pepper jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato and homemade spicy mayo!  Made uniquely flavorful, you have to try their good old fashioned, traditional Lamb Shepard's Pie (SP)... incredible! As a SP lover, I was amazed at how well the ratios of onion to garlic to thyme to rosemary were, not to mention, just the right amount of Worcestershire sauce... just enough for taste but not overwhelming! Echo 5 is the first sports anything I've liked, and is highly recommended for the folks, ambience, comfort, hominess, hospitality, great tastes and plain good food... Bon appétit!

One of the quirkiest and eccentric eateries I've ever visited and thoroughly enjoyed!  This two-story unconventionally designed and laid-out establishment, contains some of the most peculiar and outright bizarre curios and knick-knacks ever seen in a restaurant!  Where ever you decide to sit in the place, you'll be overwhelmed by anomalous, irregular and outright eerie paraphernalia that for the most part is highly unidentifiable.  A real stuffed horse, in drastic need of re-sewing it's stitches!  A turn of the past century wagon hitch that appears to look more like a giant wooden toilet with provocative artwork inside!  Despite most of the stuff is hanging over your head, and somewhat intimidating, this place if fun.  The food and overall atmosphere is awesome and terrific too!  Great service, thanx to Natalya, but she seems to represent the rest of the staff well.  Although their menu isn't ultra extensive, everything had so far has been great.  Their 'You Little Devil' consisting of six deviled egg halves, piled high with bacon and chives are fantabulous, especially when washed down with ice cold San Tan Hefewiezen Ale.  The servings of Panko Shrimp including five plump and tasty jumbo shrimp, hand breaded with Panko and excellently golden-fried, served with interesting house sauce was well worth every bite taken - left wanting for more.  Our large group of 9 folks included at least two that had been regulars 'back-in-the-day' of this weird and curious joint dating back to the fun and festive as well as misty and smoky 70's - dating ourselves here aren't we?!  A batch of pizza's were ordered and no one seemed to have any complaints about them, so either the beers, 'tinis and 'ritas were doing their jobs or the eats were downright good!  If you're in the mood for a good time with friends (or without), like to be in the midst of a fun, strange, outlandish and somewhat unbalanced environment, this has got to be the place to experience from outperforming service from staff, to the off-the-wall bric-a-bracs and knick-knacks or trinkets throughout, this is for you - not to mention the tasty fun food too.  You can be above ground upstairs with a great bar and, get this, a real honest to goodness Creature from the Black Lagoon PinBall Machine, or downstairs surrounded by, and even topped by the weird of the weird... or outside in a fabulous courtyard with bar, firepit, misters and more!  By the way, this place really looks like a Mission when you arrive!  Though by far not haute cuisine, nor nouveau anything, this is a place for the fun food aficionádo and pleasure for the atypical gourmét.  Bon appétit to the Connoisseurs of enjoyment!

Bonefish, where to fish the most delish!  I said it once and I'll say it again.  Bonefish Grill, in my book continues to be a Seafood lover's place if not paradise!  Of all the fish and seafood restaurants my wife and I have had the opportunity to try across the country, Bonefish Grill (BG) continues at the top 10 Seafood eateries in the country - regardless of which one you try. With over 200 locations across the country to boast of, and despite the volume and their size, they have found the secret of keeping their quality successfully good, service as good and as exemplary as humanly possible, excellent attention to detail and an ability to adapt to their communities and environs!  We just recently visited one of their newest restaurants, just five days after opening.  This is a time in a Restaurant business that the restauranteur wants to go by quickly because of how hard it is to avoid errors and disasters.  Let me say, they will not let you down.  We did not spot any disasters, only the opposite.  Recently having moved to Phoenix, one of the few restaurants we missed greatly from the East Coast was BG.  But now they're here, and let me tell you that it is the Fish and Seafood place to go.  The place whether you have simple or discriminating tastes.  We decided to order from our old BG faves to see if they kept their excellence across the country.  We started by cooling off with two refreshing cocktails - a Moscow Mule and a White Cosmopolitan Martini... both perfectly prepared as if the bartender had been doing them for years!  We continued in with a fantastic rendition of a large Tuna Sashimi.  Perfectly prepared with just the right amount of sesame seeds, and cooked just right!  Prepared elegantly with each required ingredient.  My wife and I can continue to say WOW! when having it.  As I've said in the past, most of their offerings tend to always be in my top ten list of always well prepared and served.  This new location is fantastic that it has the opportunity for you to dine in their regular dining area, their casual bar surround booths, and the actual bar and very, very nice, is their ample outdoor seating area.  Our next picks for dinner included Chicken Tacos with an incredible execution of Lump Crab & Corn Chowder with some bacon - simply marvelous.  Although I also had my serving of the fabulous Chowder, I had the Tempura-style Battered Fish & Chips.  Enjoyed every morsel and tidbit.  Being the fan of their east coast rendering being North Atlantic Cod, I was glad to find their use of Alaskan Pollock which like Cod is a mild-flavored white fish with a delicate and flakier, yet slightly denser in texture.  Not my all-time fish, but worked very well with their fantastic batter.  We topped off our meal with their fantastic Brownie - just great... 'nuff said!  I only have one question for corporate: Bouillabaisse, Cioppino, Caldo de mariscos, Riblji paprika, or Zarzuela - will we see a rendition of Fish/Seafood stew anytime soon?  I must also mention that Bonefish's commitment Nationally to its professionalism, services and attention offered by both our Server Colette, and knowledge and caring by the Floor Manager Rhonda, cannot be found in a more upscale bistro. Whether you want to lounge at the bar, or dine in the restaurant, we highly recommend it!  By the way, be ready for crowds in the near future though, this joint is going to be really, really very popular.  We'll be back again, and again... Keep it up Bonefish!  Profiter et bon appétit!

Southern Rail is Top on my Scale!  Kudos to Chef Justin Beckett, Southern Rail's Foodist Awards 2013 Top Chef who made it Food and Wine's Places to Eat in Phoenix and Zagat's #1 of 11, not to mention #8 restaurant on Seftel's top 10 and his staff!  But the awards are meaningless lest the eatery equals the significance of the honors - and by Jove the "Rail" does just that.  Since moving to the area, I had been hankering for some really good comfort vittles, refreshing Southern cuisine that is, and Restaurant Week helped make that happen!  Our weekly date night at the Southern Rail recently was started with a fantastic local wine, a Lawrence Dunham Vineyards Viognier 2012.  A wine rendition bringing back memories of the lush Viogniers we enjoyed while living in Virginia.  This version is full bodied yet with a lush and easy character are expressed the apparent longer growing seasons in Arizona.  With the wine, we began the incredible tastings with their cornbread muffins made with black pepper and honey butter - an incredible muffin.  For starters, we gave in to ordering "Rail's" appetizers of a great tasting and extremely well prepared fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese and pea tendrils and their smoked chicken and andouille gumbo ya ya with white rice and green onions - a fanciful rendition of a southern standard.  I loved every single spoonful - I was sorry it was gone so soon.  For the main courses, my wife thoroughly enjoyed the Grand mama's Meatloaf - my wife summing it up best said... "this has been the best meatloaf I've ever had!"  Meanwhile, I had the brilliantly prepared portion of cider brined pork loin served over brown butter whipped nicely sweet potatoes, sided by very nicely prepared collard greens - no, not vinegary.  We both enjoyed a sampling of their home-made "super" creamy grits.  So much enjoyed, that I can honestly say, I cannot remember when was the last time I had them this good.  I even asked for the recipe nicely, but was courteously denied access to it - 'bummer'!  We finished off the meal with an order of beignets with powdered sugar.  I must say though, that of the total delightful dinner extravaganza, only the beignets were not what we expected - but nobody can be perfect!  For anyone who has a love of Southern Cuisine, whether as comfort food or nouveau cuisine, Southern Rail will astonish your taste buds.  The location is a fabulous piece of restoration, redesign and history along with a comfortable, homey and yet modern atmospheric approach that is desirable, laid-back, and aesthetically pleasing to both the ambiance and comfort!  The initial views on approaching the location, is as if reaching a circa 1950's new drive-in-style structure, but once inside, everything from the incredible bar area, to the tables and seating areas, not to mention their airy and nicely landscaped and appointed outdoor area are fabulous and appealing.  Their desire to combine great food, great atmosphere, great service and great ambience has been flawlessly accomplished, and reserves us the right to continue to frequent this Chef's Masterpiece.  Chef Beckett and Staff, please continue to amaze the Gourmét and the Novice of your splendid artistry, as we plan to continue to enjoy it.  Gástro Ecléctico rates Southern Rail at the top of the heap.  Bon appétit ya'll!
