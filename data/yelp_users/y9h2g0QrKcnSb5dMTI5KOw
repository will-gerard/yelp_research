Definitely the best Italian cuisine in the valley by far.  They're specialty handmade pasta is like nothing you've ever experienced before. To top it off Marcellino has perfected the chocolate cake. The ambiance, the food, the service it's all amazing. Highly recommend

A friend and I went here for our first time for my birthday dinner...the food was delicious unfortunately the service was awful which is the reason for 2 stars. We ordered escargot,  oysters rockafeller, crab legs, ahi tuna, a $70 bottle of wine, snickers cheesecake, lava cake, and cappuccinos. So not only did we try quite a few items we also spent a lot for 2 people. From the moment we walked downstairs and met up with hostess and got ignored for a few minutes when we were the only ones there. I mean the hostess was five feet from us and only gave us a weird look until another gal came and sat us. The server seemed as tho we were a nuisance from the moment we sat down. They refused to assist with blue cheese stuffed olives and had to ask several times for a side of olives and blue cheese so we could stuff a couple ourselves. How can you claim fine dining and not have blue cheese stuffed olives for martinis? Ok that was just the tip of the iceberg. Did not get bread until main course and several requests. Not once did anyone refill our glasses of water. I actually had to get up myself and get the pitcher of water to refill our glasses. We topped off our own wine glasses every time. Our table was a mess. Plates wouldn't get cleaned off unless I asked. And don't order a cappuccino because it's definitely asking for too much. We are advocates of local fine dining but bad service can definitely ruin the overall experience. Dissapointed

I have taken the opportunity to give this place several more tries and have really come to enjoy the staff and especially the food. I guess they had a bad night but clearly their norm is great food and service

Most rude service ever! Expect eye rolling and annoyance for asking any questions. Do not support businesses that do not understand customer service. I definitely WON'T!

Huge selection of rum and unique cocktails prepared by a very knowledgeable bartender. The rum flights are a great way to taste the different types of rum

Horrible! Made an appointment for my boyfriend and I to get pedicures. We showed up 5 min early. We were greeted nicely and sat in a pedi chair quickly. A girl quickly starts to work on my boyfriends pedicure and tells me someone will be with me shortly. Well 55 minutes later boyfriend is done and no one has even acknowledged me. I asked a couple times and got no real response. What happened to ladies first? Or common courtesy? Why make an appointment? I would not recommend this place.

Food was good unfortunately the bartender was completely out of line and rude. We walk in to have dinner and watch the bronco chiefs game (I'm wearing a bronco jersey) and sit down at the bar to be greeted by the bartender very rudely say my team is going to lose and he is going to "piss in my drink". I can take friendly rivalry but this is absolutely no way to treat a customer. His demeanor and attitude was disgusting during the entirety of our meal. Needless to say we left after our meal and watched the game elsewhere.

Flies, blaring music, and more flies! I've been here a few times before and had an ok experience. Nothing special but have a good selection of salads. So I decide to bring in a couple clients for lunch to talk business and enjoy lunch. Well instead we (5 business professionals in suits) got seated at a round booth fit for a family with children at pizza joint. Music was blasting we could not hear each other talk. We asked 3 times to have the music turned down and they would turn it down 1 notch. When I addressed the manager she stated that it was already much lower than it normally was...but the last 4 or 5 times I've been here the music was no where near this disruptive. We're in Phoenix trying to enjoy a relaxing lunch not in Scottsdale! Majority of the lunch patrons were business professionals from nearby businesses. Music this loud is not relaxing. And I was probably one of the youngest patrons so don't get me wrong I love my share of loud music. But during lunch amidst a busy day is not the time. And if the music was not annoying enough the flies made up for it. We had 5-7 BIG flies swarming our table at any given time. Constant swatting and covering our food...gross. The food is good nothing spectacular but good. Definitely not worth dealing with the music and flies though. This is probably my last visit.

Everything about this place states high quality service with honest staff. They are clearly the #1 community tire shop for a reason. Techs are extremely knowledgeable and honest. Owners and staff are fantastic and very involved in the community which is also a bonus. They have 8 locations so be sure to check one out next time you need car maintenance.

Rude welcoming by owner. Store was completely empty and owner yells from back of salon "what do u need". Walked out before giving a dime to a business that doesn't understand service

Different than any crossfit gym you've ever been to. From the moment you walk in the door one of the many coaches greets you immediately and gives you the tour of the gym. Pointing out all their unique amenities available to all members. Not only does the support and motivation from the coaches set SCF apart from it's competitors but encouragement from the other friendly members definitely creates a very welcoming community feel. And to top things off they are also active in helping the community and host monthly events to give back. I'm hooked!

If you're looking for a very large selection of breakfast options this is the place. There's something for any taste bud plus beer, mimosas, and bloody Mary's. The owners and staff were extremely friendly. Overall we had a great experience.

Great variety of menu items. Quick service. As soon as you walk in one of the kind servers walks up to meet you and go over the menu and make recommendations. The owner is very kind and cares about service and his patrons.

Chantel is awesome! Very experienced with eyelash extensions. Sweet, friendly, and personable yet still professional. I was scared to change to someone new for my eyelashes but so glad I did. I will be back in 2 weeks. Easy online booking too. Go see Chantel if you want perfect lashes!

I took my 2 westies here for the first time to get a full groom. 1 of my westies is a puppy so this was his first time at the groomers. I was a bit worried he was going to be difficult because he is just so hyper. But they called me an hour and half later to tell me they were all finished. When I went to pick them up I was not only amazed at how great they looked but also how much the entire staff was excitedly talking about how much they liked them. I could really tell they were treated well. My westies were so happy and excited it definitely eased my comfort of going to a new groomer. I will definitely continue taking them to Elegant.

Food was decent service not so much. Would we come back? Probably not. The bartender called my boyfriends order of water no ice demanding lol. Could be a place to stop for a beer before or after a cubs game...if you don't need quick, correct service. Service was below par on a slow night...less than 25% full...I can't imagine it during busy spring training hours.
