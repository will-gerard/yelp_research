Start out with the cheesey garlic bread topped with fresh tomatoes. Grandmas homemade sausage recipe is one of a kind. Order the Numero Uno, you won't be dissappointed.

I have been working in this area for 12 years and have to say this is my fail safe lunch spot. I look forward to receiving their daily lunch special email as it frequently lures me in. I have several favorites on the menu but really enjoy trying their creation of the day. They always have three unique items to choose from. The go to items in my book would be the salmon blt, chef salad or the French dip sandwich. None of these are your run off the mill variety. The portions are above average with top notch quality and fair prices. Fun and comfortable place to spend your lunch hour.

Best Italian food I have had. Carbonara and alfredo are excellent accented with the homemade sausage. I agree that this place is located in an odd place. After you eat here you won't believe this place is located in a strip mall. Would have given five stars but kinda slow with the entrees and the check.

I have three for sures here. My favorite is the  grilled curry chicken. My other two stand bys are the Hawaiian BBQ mix and the Kahlua pork. The beef noodle soup is also worth a try. Good portions at an acceptable price.

The combo sandwich is awesome..great bread. The hot giardinera pepper mix is great on everything. Kinda pricey (combo &small fry no drink = $10.76) but worth it to splurge once in a while.

Boo!!! Stale dishwater China Mist iced tea. Had to dump it. Ordered a salad that took 15 minutes to prepare because the chicken wasn't prepared for the lunch rush.  No personality behind the counter. Not impressed

Did not get excited to go after a second piece of pizza. Needs some training in the team Dept too.
