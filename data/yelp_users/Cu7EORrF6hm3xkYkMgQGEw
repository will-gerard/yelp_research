Heidi and her team are a class act! They recently catered Tempe Chamber of Commerce's Women in Business Conference and I LOVED the lighter, fresher meal - you NEVER see that at a conference! And the deserts were just the right size for sharing so that everyone could enjoy their favorite flavors.  Thank you for making the day with your hospitality, Heidi!

Orange Table Tempe is the best! The staff is so friendly and the food is amazing! I'm in love with the Smocha Mocha and could eat the banana fosters French toast everyday. But I really like their lighter fare! Great options if you are trying to be mindful of your eating or want to indulge. A must stop for anyone visiting Tempe!
