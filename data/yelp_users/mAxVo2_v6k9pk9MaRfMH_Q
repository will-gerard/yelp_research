I get a gel manicure every two weeks and sometimes more if they start lifting. My nails grow super fast so the top part of my polish gets caught on stuff and start coming off. Well, I haven't had a gel mani in 3 weeks and it still looks perfect!!' Thuy was my nail technician and she is the best! She takes pride in her work and she doesn't rush! She gives wonderful pedicures also! Her massage was on point! I will only see her for my nail services from now on!

the restaurant itself was absolutely beautiful. i loved the interior. decorations, layout, ambiance, everything. i felt like i was in an upscale scottsdale restaurant. the food though wasn't so great. it was lacking flavor and was not satisfying. we ordered the last 2 rolls on the menu, which was the most expensive so we figured it ought to be good. but no, it wasn't! we also ordered the scallop poppers, which wasn't bad, but it had a distinct taste...we were still hungry so we were gonna order one more roll, but the food was so horrible we just decided to leave the restaurant hungry. we went to mcdonalds down the street and that was a lot more satisfying.   i still can't get over how beautiful this restaurant was! if only the food was better...
