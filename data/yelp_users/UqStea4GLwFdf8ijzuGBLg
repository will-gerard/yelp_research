Great Mechanic!  Very trust worthy and tries to save you a buck wherever he can without sacrificing quality. Shop has that small town atmosphere where your dealing with the owner the whole time, he also remembers your name type of car when you walk in whether your on the books or not. Shop is pretty busy, he'll try and fit you in same day if he can but if not he's usually able to get you in the next day.  Very reliable and nice, have never had to see him for the same problem twice. If the problem is different than what was originally expected, finds something else or is gonna be more than what he guessed it would be he calls to see how you'd like to proceed so that there are no surprises when you go to pick up your car.  Highly recommend this auto shop.

Every Tuesday morning after PT, love this place! Good place to go alone because they have an old school diner bar but also great to go with friends.   Large breakfast selection, sure to please everyone. All the food I've experienced was excellent but now I stick to the half order of biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs, that's more than enough.  It is a little more expensive than your typical breakfast place but the quality of the food and service makes it worth your while. Ask for Cody, she is the best server they've got.  Just a heads up, their rule is that they don't split checks no matter the size of the party. Along with that your only aloud 2 credit cards per check, everything else must be cash. Still worth it though.

Had a great time, would definitely go there again. Tickets were $17 bucks with a two purchase (drinks/food) minimum, we went to the 9 show which was drinks/appetizers only. The 7 shows your able to get there much earlier and eat dinner before/during.  It's a lil more expensive than your typical bar but that was expected since it's a "specialty" place. Dress for guys is polo/button up, either would work as well as "classy" shorts in the summer.  The headliner followed two opening acts, both of which have had Comedy Central and/or talk-show or TV appearances so they weren't random no namers... Weren't big names though obviously. All three entertainers were funny and the party I was with had a blast, would definitely like to return to the Tempe Improv.

Can't go wrong, always the best place on Mill! If you can stop at only one bar... It's Mill Cue Club!

Freaking amazing! A MUST try!  I had the Prosciutto Wrapped Hawaiian Ono, again... AMAZING! This place is awesome, can't say enough great things about it! The staff did an exceptional job. Their $5 happy hour menu is a pretty good size with pretty good portions, would recommend two if your creating a meal.  The prices are good for the happy hour selection but the full meal menu prices are  a lil steep ($25-$35, couple items up to $40) compared to surrounding restaurants but well worth it. I will definitely be visiting Roy's again as well as recommending it to others.

This place is ALWAYS dead! The fullest I've ever seen it is every seat at the bar (roughly 20 seats) plus maybe a couple tables. The only reason I'm willing to come here is because I have stupid friends that like this place. The only positive is their "Street Tacos" that I like... Which are cheap.  Overall, this place is at the bottom of the fun list... If you get pulled here, get their "Street Tacos!"

Food always taste great but sometimes they lack on the selection and take awhile to update the popular dishes. Service is horrible but the only thing you really need the servers for is to get a refill, if your drinking water just ask for a pitcher. Price is great also! Two pieces of Nigiri for $1 and half rolls for $1.50 or $2 depending on the roll.

This post office is one of the worst I have ever visited!  Most of the time I am there they only have one person behind the counter and the line is huge. I stood in line twenty minutes and the lady had the same person at the counter the whole time. I had to leave cause I was afraid I'd be late to work, I had an hour but there were still 7 or 8 people in front of me.  Also, their displays are always all messed up, I grabbed a floppy package that was on top of at least 10 others labeled as small flat rate... I finally get to the cashier and she said it wasn't flat rate, they must have been missed placed. It's a freaking post office, how stupid do you have to be to miss stock the 20 items you carry?! I said okay, where are the small flat rate boxes? She points them out and says I'll have to get back at the end of the line and that I also had to pay for the floppy package that I'd "used". It ended up being cheaper just shipping the floppy by the time it all added up, but she didn't mention this till I had already "used" the flat rate box she pointed out! Hate this post office!

Great place to go workout or relax! Workout here every Tues/Wed/Thurs with the Marines at 0600. It's a perfect location to start a run, you can run around all or half of Tempe Town Lake, go through the hilly paths of Papago or even head down Mill to "A" Mountain or ASU's Main Campus.  The scenery is great and there is a huge open grass area along with a playground and softball field. The bathrooms are kept very clean and there are consistently cleaning crews picking up and doing maintenance. It's a great place to go workout or relax.  The only downside is when there is going to be a big event because the parking lot is kind of small. At times to make matters worse, they've shut down half of it to accommodate for the crews setting up the events days before hand.  Overall, awesome park... Thank you Tempe!

Best apartments I have ever lived in! The apartments are in great shape, inside and out... Everything is relatively new from the kitchen appliances, laundry room and fixtures... It all has a modern look that is clean and sophisticated. Tons of grass for my dog to run around in as well as a pools and a sand volleyball court that's relatively close to all the apartments.  As for the tenants, everyone for the most part appears presentable and keeps up with the look of the complex. Driving through the parking lot all the vehicles are well kept and look nice. There's dog poop stations everywhere and people actually use them, it's great!  Definitely the place to live if your looking for a new home.

Good food and good service, place has a lot of potential. Only been twice and just happened to be the same bartender both times, she remembered what I ordered previously to the "T" (food and drink).  Pretty good selection with your typical bar foods (burgers, wings...) plus a lil extra with pizzas and Mexican. They take the typical though and change it up with different types of "buns", combinations and for the burgers even patties.  Both times I ordered the Truck Stop Burger but and subbed for their chicken patty (awesome), added grilled onions and guac. It was good stuff!  Would encourage the mixing and matching of they're burger combinations.
