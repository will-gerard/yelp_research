I crave Chinese food at least once a week and wanted to try something different from the usual place I always go to. Ordered for pick up, price is decent and food was nice. I ordered orange chicken combo which includes plain fried rice, a cream cheese puff and a veggie egg roll. The lady said I would be getting soup with my order also but I never got it. I didn't really care about the soup honestly though.The portions are filling, this isn't my favorite Chinese place but it would be my second choice. Definitely will be back

Best Chinese food I've ever had. Cheap and tasty. I tried the all you can eat buffet before, delicious and only 5 bucks and some change. Tonight though I ordered to go and the food was just as good. Sesame chicken, orange chicken, fried rice, lo mein and eggroles. Gosh their eggroles are heaven. You get so much food for the price, I got the smaller combo and oh boy it wasn't small at all. So so so good! The owner Judy is so sweet too, great service! I'll be back :)

I just left this place with my friend, the only pro is that the waiters were super friendly and the service was fast, got our food pretty quick considering it was busy. We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap, my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries, they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy, plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap.

I'm giving this particular Sally's location 5 stars for a reason. The employees are super nice yada yada yada, haha but they actually know what the hell they are talking about when it comes to hair, makeup, styling tools, ect. I went to a salon recently to get my roots done and they totally screwed up my hair :( so I decided to start doing my roots myself. The lady at Sally's showed me ALL the products I would need down to a T, and she also told me in detail how to use them.  She told me what makeup to start buying for my skin tone and she showed me some styling appliances that wouldn't be too damaging on my hair. I've been to a couple different Sally's around the valley and this one is by far the best.

Alright my friend and I came here for dinner because its fairly close to my house. Our waiter was fantastic! Always was there when our drinks were running low, didn't have to ask her twice for something and she was just very polite and professional. The food was so amazing too, the specials are always delicious as well. I seriously recommend this place if you want tasty food with a nice atmosphere. Ive come here multiple times and its nearly becoming my favorite place to eat out at. :)

Had dinner here last night. Awesome chicken smoked BBQ sandwich and cornbread is delicious. Service was excellent, people were very nice even though I didn't know what I want and took some time to order. Place is clean, free refills on drinks. Will be back

My boyfriend wanted KFC so I took him to this location because it was the one closest to us. Well we went through the drive thru and there was only one car ahead of us, we waited 20 minutes until the car in front finally got their food and left. I was a little pissed because we went through the drive thru for a reason, for fast service! So, when I pulled up to the window, This girl (red head) was frantically trying to get our order together and the people's behind us. I then saw another employee (dark hair) just standing there, texting on her cell phone! She was just letting this poor girl handle all the orders and food herself. I think they should fire that girl that was screwing around on her phone because there are plenty of people who need a job and will actually work too. My boyfriend yelled through the window "get off your phone and help her" but the girl just looked at us, walked away and continued to use her damn phone. Not professional at all, please fire her.

Went for my friends birthday and it actually was a pretty cool place. Has two sections, one for comedy and entertainment, the other side had pool tables. Nice selection of drinks, people are very welcoming. I heard theres another location with a Pranksters so, I gotta go check that one out too :)

My friend took me here for lunch and it was sooooo good. I didn't even know this place was here, it's hidden by all the other buildings around it but I'm super glad my friend introduced me to this place. Will be coming here more often.

Well let me start that this place has been around for forever, so they must be doing something right. I remember going here with my family after all my silly plays in elementary school and I still go here, I'm now in college. The food is really yummy  and the price is inexpensive. The restaurant decor is a little funky but I don't go there for that. The people who work there are super nice and will take very good care of you. They have weird hours on Saturday though, which is my only complaint. They open around 4:30 pm but the food is so worth it.

I was craving fried rice and lo mein but I didn't want to go to Panda Express. So I decided to try this place out because of the good reviews, plus it's only 3 miles away from my house. I didn't dine in, I called them and ordered for pick up. I got the basil fried rice with tofu, lo mein noodles with tofu and the steamed veggies with tofu (I absolutely love tofu!!!!) the steamed veggies also come with white rice and a brown sauce. I thought all of the food I got was going to be side dishes since everything was only 4.99 but nope, I literally got 3 big entrees. You get a lot of food for what you pay for. The lo mein was delicious and the veggie plate with steamed rice and brown sauce was mouth watering. The basil fried rice was a little funky because of the basil haha it's really good but then you get hit with an intense after taste of basil. I can handle it but people who absolutely cannot stand basil should skip it or ask if they can get the rice without the basil. I just threw some soi sauce on it and it was yummy. I only gave this place 4 stars because I don't know how their dine in experience works but next time I will definitely go here to eat instead of calling in. I also will try some of their entrees with meat in it to see how it taste. So all in all, the food was great and the price was even better. You gotta try this place!

I never knew there was a Sephora in this location before! I went inside and easily broke the bank. Had a nice selection of pretty much everything. Love this place, will come back here more often.

Love this place! I have bleached hair and i always go there to get my roots done. I agree with someone elses  post tho, the manager at the front counter is rude but everyone else there is super nice. My hair always ends up feeling so healthy after i leave this place even after all the damage i do to my hair. One girl even taught me how to touch up my roots myself to save money. So, i only go there now to be pampered :) give this place a try before you judge!

Wow sad to say my experience this time was complete crap. Where to even begin haha, well I came in to get a new hair color(I am platinum blonde And I wanted to go a Carmel brown) She said she was goin to do an all over foil with the caramel color throughout my hair, that way I will still have some of the blonde hair that was already still in my hair. When she was washing the color out, she used a toner to tone down the blonde I still had in my hair. Well the first toner didnt even work, so she used another type of toner, still didn't  even work. So, she just ended up drying my hair as is. It looked pretty nice, I liked it. She offered to add more caramel colors to it so I said yes. I think she expected me to say no because she was like "oh well, we already did so much today, maybe you should schedule another appointment with me and we can just continue then." Ummm okay??? Why did you even offer then? So when I went to pay, she said it was 140 dollars. I thought to myself that couldn't be right because it didn't seem like she did that much work for it to be that much money. I asked her why it was that much and she said "we colored your hair one whole color then added highlights and toned your hair twice" She ended up charging my for the toners that didn't even work on my hair, which is fine I guess. But she never colored my hair one color then highlighted it. She did a foil on my head with the caramel color, the highlights that were in my hair were from the blonde hair I had when I originally walked into the salon. I looked online and for a full foil on your hair, it's 80 bucks not 140. I wouldn't mind paying so much for my hair if she ended up putting all that work in but she didn't. She completely over changed me for services she never did. I told her that and of course she got all snippy and threw a fit. I just paid it and tossed a 20 dollar tip her way, which she didn't deserve. I'm not coming back here ever and unless you like being over charged for things your stylists didn't do then you should avoid this place too.

I always pass this place when going to Target or Game Stop and I always thought it looked nice from the outside. So I went here for lunch today to try it out. The food was delicious, they had pizza by the slice, which I thought was really convenient. So, I ordered a slice with pineapple on it and a side of fried mushrooms. It was super good, pizza was cooked on point  (Not soggy or anything) and the fried mushrooms were cooked perfectly. My friend kept it simple by ordering a burger and some onion rings, which he said was one of the best burgers he has ever consumed.I only have 2 complaints: 1) drinks are a little expensive, you should come during happy hour or Sundays because that's when the best drink specials are. And 2) our waitresses head was up in the clouds. It wasn't even busy but we has to ask her twice for a refil on our drinks and when we got our food, she went in the back and never came out. We had to hunt her down for the check. I would definitely come back though :)

I've been here a total of 4 times and every time has been great. The bartenders are friendly, they serve you right away,  the service is good, they really try and take care of you. The man working suggested some drinks I should try and they were all very good. I've ordered food here 2 of the 4 times I've been here and it's tasty, better than expected for bar food. Prices are decent not too expensive and the bathrooms are clean. This is one of my new, favorite spots to have a couple of drinks and have a good time.

Why does everyone like Starbucks? Its always busy and It's overly priced, overrated coffee. I only stop by here if I forget to make my blend the night before and if I am going to school/work and I'm too tired to function. Well I stopped by here around 9 am and the drive thru was super packed (of course) so I went inside. I looked around, only saw a couple of people so I thought everything was going to be all good. Well I ordered an iced coffee, nothing too complicated, the guy asked me my name so I told him. A few minutes later the guy was calling out Sarah a bunch of times and I looked around and I was the only female in there. I just assumed this Sarah girl had left early. Well 20 freakin minutes later I still didn't have my coffee so I went up to the front and asked the dude where my coffee was. He said he was calling my name a bunch of times but I didn't come up to get my coffee. My name is Callie, like California. Not Sarah. I don't know how he managed that to mess up. When I finally did get my coffee, it tasted like crap. Circle k has better coffee than this. I'm going to stick to making my own brew, saves me some more cash anyway.

They had a special where you buy a 100 dollar gift card for only 50 bucks, great deal. Even though they were super booked, they were able to get me in early on Saturday. Bri did my hair and she did an amazing job, my hair is super damaged and fine and she was still able to lighten it without frying my hair. She massaged my head while washing my hair, I almost fell asleep because it was so nice and relaxing. After she dried it, my hair looked and felt so healthy and soft. Bri even recommended products to me without being pushy about it. I ended up picking out something to help reduce the damage in my hair, it was 15 percent off products too! Even more off if you bought more than one. The bill wasn't bad at all, very reasonable for a high end salon. The two front desk ladies were very sweet and helpful too. Janet is one of them and she rocks! Will definitely be back :)
