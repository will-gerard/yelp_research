I think my sister and I have tried almost every place in the west valley.  This one I will definitely return to.  Great pedicure!!!!  Priced well.  I could always use a long massage and this one was about ten minutes.

Worse $15 I have ever spent.   A joke of a pedicure. Little to no massage and the buffing of my feet was terrible.  They might be worse now.  Save your $15 for the delicious sushi next store.

Best car buying experience ever!!! Joel, Will and Scott were amazing!!! When you are ready to get a new or pre owned car do not go anywhere else!!!!

If you have all day to sit and wait for food and drink that is just ok... run to this place.  If you expect normal service and not to wait 30 minutes for a margarita then go anywhere else.  The server was very flustered with only a few tables.  When we spoke the manager/owner, she did not care that service was bad.  They really only care for their regulars... in fact so much that regulars who walked in 30 minutes after us were invited to quickly put their order in before us.  I have visited this place twice in the last two weeks and both times I felt like an inconvenience.  If they only want to serve their regulars they should close for a private party EVERYDAY!

This is the best place.  Great prices, they get the work done quick.  Keep it local and get your tires and auto work done here. Cheap oil changes.
