The grooming services here are not good. Each groomer is different and depending on their knowledge, they may or may not give your dog the correct cut for their breed. We have a West Highland Terrier who is rarely groomed properly.   We used to overlook the grooming issue up until recently. We asked the groomer to give our dog a shorter cut for the summer, as in the same style but just shorter in length. When we got him back the groomer had completely shaved off all of the dog's fur, basically leaving him with a buzz cut. Also, they must have cut him because there is a spot that keeps reopening, bleeding, and matting his fur. It has yet to heal and it has been over a month now since his appointment. We are taking him to the vet and he may have to have surgery in order to correct this mistake.

The best smoothie shop in the valley. The family who own Paradise Juice is always friendly and they are very quick when preparing your order. They have an extensive menu of smoothies, juices, salads, and sandwiches, all made with fresh and healthy ingredients.

Great nail salon. Very spacious and lots of room for customers. The employees are willing to stay past normal hours to work with you when they are busy.

As someone who used to work in retail (not at Nordstrom but one of their competitors), I will say that this is an excellent company. People complain in their reviews that the employees are concerned about making their commission-well obviously! That's how they make most of their money. Pretty much all retail companies use a commission structure for paying their employees. If you want better service you need to stick to one  sales associate to show that you are a serious buyer and not wasting their time.   Nordstrom has the best quality, brands, and pricing of products. It's hard to find good quality items at a decent price anymore but Nordstrom has them. Free shipping, easy returns, price matching, and ordering for you in store are some of the best perks that Nordstrom offers.

Delicious, authentic Italian food. It's usually pretty busy but I've never waited long to get my order. My family has been coming here for years and it is always a great experience.

Delicious & super reasonable. Pretty fast service as well. I always have a good experience at the Iron Chef!

I got food to go from here last night. I ordered the AZ burger which was good but they gave me the most stale, inedible fries I have ever had. Not cool when the meal cost $13.00-not including the tip I gave them.

This place is amazing! It's the only option in Old Town for late night Mexican food. The only downside is that the line is crazy long and they only have 2 people working so it takes forever to order.

Staff is very friendly and professional. However, the food is way too rich. My brother and I both felt sick afterwards and we ordered different items on the menu.
