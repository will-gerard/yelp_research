This hole in the wall quite possible has the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Deffinitely the best Wor Won Ton soup and pork Egg Foo Young. Great for carry out and they have a large delivery area!

Sold me the world's worst phone without telling me the Droid was comming out in 2 weeks. Stuck with a Samsung SEGA for another 6 months. Does all tech stuff great. Sucks as a phone. Can't hear, drops calls repeatedly, (could be Verizon's Network too). I can't wait to get rid of it and possible Verizon too.

My wife and I decided on take out tonight and Outback was our choice. We used the online ordering through their website. Blooming onion, 2 orders of babyback ribs, shrimp ceaser salad. Used their curbside service which was quick and easy and took the food home. Unfortunately, in stead of the blooming onion, we had Auhi tuna instead. So back to Outback I went. Talked to Marc the manager, who for my trouble removed the charge of the onion and gave me one for free, told me to keep the tuna and try it and gave me a coupon for another b-onion on my next visit.  Wasn't too happy I had to drive there two times in one evening, but was very happy the way the Marc and the staff handled my problem. I would/will eat there again.

Fast and friendly service. The staff does not ignore the customers but engages in conversation while your smoothie is being made. The smoothies are great too and you get good value for your $$

Stopped in for a  Bagel-Dog. They had only one on the shelf. Looked as if it had been pre-cooked once or twice. After asking if there were any others, I was told, "Nope. That's it." So I left it and walked out. So much for my Bagel-Dog. It will be a long time before I go into that place again.

Went to have a key made.  Big sign on the door:  "We Are a Dog Friendly Store Please Don't Leave Your Pet in the Car!"

Food is good. We do take out from there a lot. Enjoy the Gyro platter with the lemon flavored rice . The saganaki was a bit of a disapointment and over priced, but the calamari was excellent and great value for the price.  The chocolate cake was tasty but again a bit high priced

Tool home a large sausage pizza from there last night. They make their pizza with a thin style crust and use home made sausage. The people were friendly and actually talked to you while you wait, unlike many other resturants. Only problem was the sause on the pizza was way too sweet. A bit to much sugar was added where I prefer that the tomato sauce be a bit more tangy then sweet. Other than that the pizza was good.

Had a men's prayer breakfast there at 7am yesterday which the cafe owner Big Joe graciously hosted. Most ordered the $2.99 breakfast special which includes; 1 egg, homestyle potatoes, bisket & gravey. Really enjoyed it all.
