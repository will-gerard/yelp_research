My fav restaurant in Arizona!  Everything just works!  Do yourself a favor, call a few days in advance and reserve a table in the cellar. Dark, sexy and the perfect setting for a date. The bartender Steve is by far the best there is.  Try to arrive for happy hour and order the small plates. You wont want a meal after you eat them. $5 each during happy hour or $9 each during peak times. Also to get the deal, you have to be seated AT the bar and not at any of the surrounding tables. Kind of lame but whatever.  My dad is a big steak guy who lives in NY and gets only the best. The Rokerij's steaks rival some of Manhattan's top joints like Sparks!  Beer selection is solid, although they could use a few more draft selections and the wine list is good.  Again--don't even bother dining upstairs. Enjoy the dark cellar, dimly lit by the fireplace, with The Cure, Coldplay and other great bands rotating on the cd player.

Ethan is the man!  I have been coming to see him for quite some time and what I probably like best is that he tells me what he is going to do in terms of color--after all he knows what is going to look good and I trust his judgement. Then he grabs you a beer or a glass of wine and then gets to work.  The salon is way cool. Kind of artsy with a rock and roll edge. Everyone is so friendly from Pablo to the new cute blonde girl who works up front who is ALWAYS smiling and dancing!   If I ever leave PHX, this is a place I will truly miss.   I am honored to call E a friend and always leave the salon laughing after hearing some of his latest stories!

I dig this place and let me tell you why...  They have awesome selection of skis, clothing and everything between.  The manager does a good job of steering you towards the more expensive jackets, so keep that in mind. The staff is generally pretty good here and helpful.  They have a better selection of Spyder gear than any other place I know of outside of CO.  Rental gear is sucks... maybe that is part of the plan...give you crap to ski with so you want to buy your own good stuff!  One of the best things is that you can buy your lift ticket for Snowbowl and a host of other mountains right in the store! Hey if it's the same price as on the mountain and saves you time not having to wait in a lift ticket line...count me in!  So get your rental gear here and your lift ticket and save the time and hassle on Snowbowl.  Lookin forward to a great 2011 ski season!

Such a great place!!!!  The wine selection is awesome and the bruschetta rocks!   If you are still hungry, walk across the parking lot to LGO and get one of the better pizzas in AZ!  PERFECT date spot!

I haven't been back in a while, but I really like this place.  When my parents had a place over at the Pointe at Squaw Peak, I was in search of good NY pizza.   I stumbled upon this place back in 96 and loved it!  I think there are plenty of other quality pizza joints out here now that are as good, if not better, but I would not hesitate for a second visiting Pat's.

Awesome.  So much better than parking on site.  Safe and good prices keep me coming back.  Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day.

You had me at hello. You had me at hello...  For me (and my dad), I am all about first impressions, and if you have bad salsa than I am not likely going to return. Or if you make me PAY for my chips and salsa--FAIL!  Pancho's salsa rocks the house!   Their food is great and call me crazy, but I like eating in their seedy bar.   Their frozen margs arent too bad either.  If you want authenticity--this is the place!

Great hike with your dog!  Took my 6 yr old dog for her first mountain hike and she kicked ass!  We hiked the south side of the mountain up to the stone hut at the top. Great views to be had and really reminds you of how lucky you are to live in such a great city!

What a great little spot!  Went last night and I ordered the pho and she ordered the chicken soup. We both loved our food and would go again for sure. The pho was so good, I finished the whole monsterous bowl!   The owner (I am guessing he is the owner) was working and was very helpful.   Don't be discouraged that this is located in a strip mall.   Do yourself a favor and give it a try. It is cheap and worth the experience.

These guys make a damn good pizza!  I usually get chicken on pizzas, but skip it here. It is very watery and not high quality. Dominos has a better chicken topping. Go with the roasted red peppers! I do agree with a previous reviewer, they are a bit stingy on the toppings.  Don't get me wrong--this is the best pizza you will find in AZ.  These guys take their time and even have a water filtration system to balance it the same as NY's water. Think the water doesn't matter when you are making the dough--Think Again!   Also give the house red a try. I usually do not enjoy the house wines very much, but at Grimaldi's, it is actually my fav.  This is a great place for a first date--you will not break the bank and you can really enjoy some quality pizza and wine.

THE best grocery store on the planet!  You get the freshest veggies and top o the line meats from the butcher.  Everyone is beyond helpful and makes going there very enjoyable.  Skip the pizza they make and head to their salad bar! Great stuff!!  Also, the bread that they make and sell is the best. Only three ingredients, so its void of all that crap that you don't want (or shouldn't) in your body. But a couple loafs and throw the extra in the freezer.   AJ's is more expensive than Safeway, but if you are looking for better meats and veggies, head there. You can get better prices for wine and beer at Safeway, however AJ's has a wine expert there all the time to help guide you towards something that you haven't tried but likely will enjoy. Actually the guy there pushed me towards a bottle of Malbec on sale for around $10 that I loved! Wasn't trying to upsell me to a $40 bottle.

I came in skeptical and left a believer!  This place is great! I am not a vegan nor a vegitarian, so when my friend Dave suggested this for lunch I was concerned.   After a bite of my mock chicken rice bowl with peanut sauce, I was all in. The lime aid is awesome too!  Don't confuse vegan for low calorie though!

I do not like you either.  I mean its obvious you must not like me, serving shredded chicken in a burrito that tastes CANNED!  You call that salsa? That is hot sauce in a cup. Come on. I like spicy food, but give a guy some options here.  No bar area either...thats kind of lame.  So yeah, we won't ever be friends. I'll be down the street at Pancho's instead.

Elsa's Chicken Sandwich....THE very best!   Whoever Elsa is, I would like to meet and thank (and possibly make out with). This chicken sandwich is perfect.  Tender flat white meat covered in a dragon sauce with green peppers and pecans. My gf couldnt stop eating my fries and the drinks...don't get me started! Everything features a VERY strong pour.  Tip your bartenders well! They are really taking care of you here.  Like cucumbers? Try the tasty Moscow Mule! Vodka with cukes and ginger beer served in an old school copper mug. One of the best drinks out there!  The atmosphere is fantastic and I have been coming here for well over 10 years.   They always have some cool art featured in the place and the location is a bit off the beaten track...meaning less tourists and more locals.   For the tourists reading this that are coming to Scottsdale--You're Welcome.

FANTASTIC!  The sweet potato fries steals the show.  The burgers are great and the beer selection is only second to the Yard House. I may or may not have had six too many beers on more than one occasion.  There is a reason this place gets Best of Phoenix every year!  Hip, good prices and the best sp fries I have ever had!

Average slices. Nothing special.  Not sure how much they pay the New Times for being nominated as PHX's best slice, but I disagree.  I will say the prices are good and the girl who works the counter is always nice.   Way better options out there, but if you are in a hurry and live close to this location...

Smoke and mirrors...atmosphere vs substance....  I am NOT a fan. This is your typical Scottsdale spot that puts their efforts into the decor (which is REALLY nice) and not into their boring menu.  Skip it.

THE very best wings!!  The raspberry-chipotle wings are unreal. If there is breading on this, I can't tell! Tastes like premium white meat chicken that is cooked to perfection.Truthfully they are so good, I have yet to eat anything else at this place and have been going for years.   The beer is served ice cold and the wait staff and bartenders are very friendly.  This is a great place to hang out and catch a game.  Doesn't matter if you come with a group or roll here solo, this place serves up quality food at great prices...especially  happy hour!

After reading everyone else's reviews before making my way to La Piazza, I prepared myself for poor service and possibly bland pizza.   Sorry guys, but you are way off.   I arrived at noon and got seated right away. The waiter was attentive and had NO problems there either.   The pizza was delivered hot and quick to our table. We ordered a pie with Schrieners sausage and carmelized onions and it was VERY good! Now I am not saying it's the best I ever had, that will always go to Sunrise Pizza in Rye, NY...but I would put this certainly in the top 10 in AZ.  This is a very casual place and could probably use some updating on the decor, but the pizza is good and I would certainly make my way back here.

This is my fav "fast food" place out there!  The first time I tried Which Wich was when I was working the NHL All Star Game in Dallas. In the local mall's food court, I saw this new sandwich place. So I grabbed some sandwiches for my coworkers and we all loved it!  I noticed they put one in Westgate a couple years ago and have been going quite a bit.  The sandwiches are hot and you really get what YOU want. Sorry Subway, now you know why I haven't emailed or texted.   The turkey, chicken and hummus are great sandwich choices. Do yourself a favor and for an xtra $2, get double meat.   I eat lunch here at least 2x a week!

The Costco of Italian restaurants.  Terrible food and service.  Listen, I get Italian family style dining. In fact I am a fan of it, especially being from NY. But what you serve I wouldn't feed my dog.  Please leave.   Thank you and good day.

Great pizza and the waitress was SO patient with us, as we closed up the place.  We had one of their pizzas with sausage on it and it was out of this world.  The wine selection was pretty good and was in a hip and comfortable setting.  This also is a great date place and I have to agree with another reviewer--it matches up with Bianco's...minus the 3 hour wait!  I still give Grimaldi's the lead...but just by a nose.

You know, this place has now surpassed Grimaldi's for me. Their pizza is exceptional. Great selection of toppings and a great atmosphere.  Just go man. Just go.

So I went here for lunch the other day expecting good fish and chips...well I was wrong!  They were fish sticks! Who the hell serves those anymore?  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and nice. The highpoint of my lunch for sure.  So MAYBE I had a Guinness for lunch. What I didnt expect was $7 for the pint! Am I seriously back home in NY right now??   FIsh and chips and MAYBE a beer + tip = $32 for lunch!!  Total rip off--never again.

These guys can make a great pie!  You know what I really love about them? You can walk in at any given time and they have a huge selection of slices. I am not talking about your boring pepperoni or cheese as your options, I am talking about chicken with roasted red peppers, buffalo chicken pizza, two kinds of Sicilian, white with tomato and many more.  Certainly the best pizza in Ahwatukee, though that is not saying much. They do make my top 10 in AZ.  They make a mean chicken parm slice. Grimaldi's needs to take a page out of their book to understand what chicken on a pizza is supposed to taste and look like.

While the food is decent the service sucks. Personally I hate the place but I'm dragged here each weekend to endure the conversation of a kid working here who tells me that 45 mins is a standard wait for a breakfast burrito. No more. Today was my last visit. Note--Not all the servers are bad. A couple guys here are really good. I know everyone wants to enjoy a mock sausage scramble...but step up your game on service.  Oh and get high chairs with buckles for infants that work.

FINALLY! Good Italian back...wayyyyy back....in the Tukee Foothills.  I have to give them credit...they have some balls. I mean every other place that opened business in that same corner location in the Safeway plaza died a rather quick and painful death.  My lady and I ordered some takeout and I had the lavosh and she had an amazing pasta dish. They make their pasta from scratch and use organic foods too.  The best part was picking up the food and noticing the local beer selection...on tap!   Hint for new restaurants--get the local brew on tap...you get major props and repeat customers. Word to your mother.  Next time we are going to eat there!

Mike gave me a fair quote over the phone to install a 30amp outlet outside my house. Was very helpful, explained what he needed to do, was on time and I would absolutley call him the next time I need any electrical services.  Listen--if you want a no hassle experience call Good Guys. You can thank me later.

Love this place. Jeff knows his craft and I dig the "you have to be in the know" to even find this place. Luckily its damn close to work. Maybe a little too close.  Nevertheless he makes excellent beer and I'm a fan.

The pizza is Peter Piper quality. If you like good pizza learn from my mistake. Skip this place.  The sauce is nasty. They put too much on and it kills any potential for a decent bite.  The veggies are average and the meats are OK--glad they have chicken as an option.  No matter what you put on it, the sauce overpowers the pizza as a whole.  Much better pizza over at Jimmy and Joes for lunch. Dinner? Grab Grimaldis.
