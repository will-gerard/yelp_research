Had my eyes done two years ago and am scheduled for breast lift, build in bra, augmentation and rhinoplasty with Dr.  Robert G. Bonillas on May 22nd.  I feel very comfortable with Greenbaum and my doctor after the last results I will stay overnight this time and leave with a pain pump this is a great facility.

It took moving to San Diego and using a different store to realize how FANtastic THIS store is! Always PLENTY of skilled staff, always FAST and personalized customer service as if you are purchasing a BMW.  Amazing, big thumbs up!!!!

We came tonight to hear #Urban #Poetry in #Downtown #Phoenix. Supporting the arts instead of thug life, we were shocked to see the owner call and kick out the poetry group for curse words on their t-shirts and poetry they do not like (no one even took the mic). Meanwhile, the empty venue was filled with patrons the comedy troupe brought in ordering drinks and dinner that would have been better down the road. The Duce may have censored our evening, but they have now also censored their clientele.  My husband said it would've been more proper to let the event happen and then not allow it to happen again if it was something that bothered you but once you agreed to it and this many people put in effort behind it put it on their calendar mark it off as a night to go out on the town you don't screw your customers that way. and yes of course he should've done his homework which I'm sure now he will put a process in place but that doesn't affect all of the people that were there last night. If he wants this kind of white homogenous restaurant he should've opened in Chandler not downtown Phoenix. So rude, so uncalled for, so done with that place and their TERRIBLE parking and $160 vest sweatshirts. Who do they think they are? Solace was watching the entire place empty out into nothing as we left.

Best place in Downtown Phoenix for a great time.  Gorgeous surroundings.  Upscale.  Yet down to earth and diverse crowd.  LOVE IT!  Love the Concierge Manager Michael, he makes everyone feel VIP.

Bob Faith is the real deal, I am a cynic and he makes me go DEEP!  If he wasn't great, do you think Johnnie Carson would have had him on the show?  Gia Heller, President www.TheNationalBusinessExperts.com

Wow I thought you had to use strong chemicals to get a house clean boy was I wrong.  Not only are they sticklers for detail but their products won't hurt your pets or children.  Big thumbs up.

Fast, early pick up at the ballet! My heels were killing me and we were starving and there they were to two damsels rescue!  Even more impressive when my husband showed up they had a second pedicab to make sure we could all fit!!

Terrible customer service. Went through the drive-through ordered nuggets they never asked if I wanted to sauce figured that out a few miles down the road had to turn around so I didn't eat them dry.   Get back have to wait in line again and they offer absolutely nothing for the waste of my time and additional gas mileage.  Poor customer service.

I hired Randy Keith of Premier Piano Shows for my April 2014 wedding.  My husband is a neo classical composer, and we trusted no one else to play his songs at our wedding.  In addition, Randy also played modern songs, Billy Joel and got the crowd singing along with him.  Whether solo, or with his beautiful bride by his side (often dueling wife!) Premier Piano Shows is sure to be a hit with any of your guests!  Subsequently, I own 3 businesses and we have hired Randy for Corporate Gigs as well.  Always classy, always on time & always a good time.
