I have to give this hospital five stars because they saved my life. After being in a different hospital for over a week then being released back home I got sick. I went to chandler regional emergency room with pain in my chest and couldn't breath. The doctor did a scan and saw black spots threw out all my lungs and she then started all sorts of test on me. I was emitted to the hospital and continued to do more test and was put on antibiotics. When they didn't work the doctor chose to do surgery and go inside my lungs to scrape out samples  to test. I ended up having  pneumonia and something else. I was treated very well by the staff and was treated for the pain. The only complaint I have is the food was horrible.

I took my Grandpa here and the doctor was really good with explaining what was wrong with his eyes. I have nothing bad to say about this place so far I will be coming back time and time.

Last time I was here I ordered the sesame chicken and scallop beef. I enjoyed the sesame chicken and the only thing that I didn't like about the scallops and beef where the scallops where just plain. Make sure if you pay with your ATM card they don't use it as credit like they did with me when I asked for debit so I wouldn't get charged credit card fees.

This golf course is very nice and a fun place to golf. The driving range is rite by the golf shop and restaurant. The Course is kept very clean and I really like the way the course goes three the mountains. The view is nice from a couple of the coursers holes.

I have gone to Teds a couple of times and like it a lot. The chili dogs are really good and come in 6 in or 12 in. It gets really busy and the line can be long at times but seems to go fast. The only thing I don't like is the feeling of being rushed when you order but other then that it is worth the hustle. The onion rings and shakes are really good too. The menu is very simple with just a few things on it and instead of having a ton of food they picked to perfect the few items they do have. I would recommend trying this place at least once and I think you will be hooked.

I love the food here the only thing is it can get pricey.  The burritos are huge and come with rice, beans, meat, salsa, lettuce, sour cream and other options. You can also choose a bowl instead of burrito the has all the same choices like a taco salad. They have a few things for the kids to get also.

Hole in the wall but somewhere  to fall asleep. It's down the street from the strip so as you can imagine the freak show you get to watch. It's in a very busy place.

I wanted to update this review because I have notices a change in the way the apts are ran lately. I am  very impressed with management lately in wanting to help solve issues and I feel they are doing a good job at running the place.

I've had Rosatis before and the food is OK in my opinion. I think they are a little over priced. I had it delivered so I can't comment on the restaurant. The food was delivered fast. I ordered a Connolly and thought it was OK nothing special but the fish and chips where good. Overall I would try them again but not my first choice.

Good place to go and enjoy a latte or your favorite coffee. I like getting coming here to relax and use the WI Fi on my phone because with AT&T I don't get unlimited data. The service here has always been good and the staff is friendly. The parking lot is large because it is in a shopping center. I love Starbucks so this is one of my favorite places to go.

The five stars are for the pharmacy at this location. Lamontae and the other younger guy are awesome. I must use this Walgreens a lot because they both greet me by my first name every time I walk in which is nice. When an employee takes the time to remember your name it's a nice personal touch that I enjoy. I am always welcomed with a smile and friendly attitude when shopping here or picking up medicine. The store is like every other basic Walgreens. This location has a minute clinic  with a PA who can take care of most basic health needs. The pharmacy has a drive up window if you don't feel like going in the store. I like how it's open 24/7 both the store and pharmacy.

This is close to my house and is open 24 hours a day so I come here allot. Its McDonalds what can I say fries and burgers. Lately I like coming here for breakfast and get pancakes with  iced coffee which I enjoy. They have dollar parfait's that are good. This location has two drive threw that get backed up sometimes. I'm sure most of you have had McDonalds and this location has all the same meals and burgers. The food is always good and seems to be fresh here and the workers are friendly also.

I was thinking of moving in here and really like the place. I will write more when I move because all I can talk about is how i was treated when looking at a place. The places i checked out where nice and homier and the staff was friendly. I like that the lake is right outside your door and you can go o it just cant swim. I think its going to be a good place to move and i Will let you all know how it goes.

I order food from here a lot for my grandparents. It's a small place in the Fry's shopping center. I personally like the orange chicken, sesame chicken and beef and broccoli. The food is good here but I do think it is way over priced. The family meal is good and comes with two main dishes, egg roles, shrimp, rice and soup. This place is worth trying if you like Chinese food.

Excellent service I received at this location the many times I've been here. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The manager went out of her way to talk to all guest and ask if the service was good or how could it be better. I already know how to activate my bank card but it was nice of the lady helping me to go out to the ATM and make sure it worked properly.

This Fry's in Queen Creek has a Starbucks and also a little sushi bar next to the cakes. I enjoy the cakes from here and the cake boss cakes are on special. This location also has a bank and a machine to put money on electric if you have pay as you go electric as I do. You can go grocery shopping and get gas. Also you can go to the bank, rent a movie or get your hair done all in this little shopping center. The employees are very nice and help full here as we'll.

I have to say the only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because of one of the delivery drivers that work here. I still don't know his name but I will update it when I find out because I've never had a delivery guy that is as friendly and helpful as this guy. I enjoy the mild hot wings and cinnamon sticks here and order them a lot. The driver knew my name after a couple of times and always gives me coupons and info on the best deals so I can save money. I thought that was very nice of him and he deserves to be recognized for going above his job to make his customers happy.

Bruschetta is really good here. They offer tours of the olive groves and have a wide variety of olives to select from inside the store. They also have Sandwiches and Italian ice cream to choose from. Over all it's just a nice little place to go and have lunch or just visit .

First time here for the Christmas light parade and had a great time. Love the lake and how the bridges are lit and reflect off the water. Would love to go in the day time to check out all the restraints close by.

I have not ordered one thing here I didn't like. Some of my favorites I order are the pastor tacos, Burritos are big, shrimp cocktail, menudo, and love the fried ice cream. I enjoy the fruit drinks they serve fresh. The staff is friendly and keeps the place clean. The pace is small so it gets full fast and not many seats.  Next time I would like to try the hot dogs here and see if its as good as they look. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I think it's to pricey for hole in the wall Mexican food. If you are thinking of trying it I believe you will be happy you did.

This place was really hard to access by wheelchair. I noticed the inside was not the most appealing. The art work on the walls where nice and painted by the cook we had . The reason I found out it was his paintings is when I was pushing my grandpa out to the car he gave my girlfriend a card and told her he liked the way she handled herself and had a job for her. Come to find out he is an artist and wanted my girlfriend to call him which was not cool of him and can only imagine what kind of work he had for her. The baked pancakes where good but got really doughy. All the other food was average. I don't think I will be coming back here again after my girlfriend was uncomfortable with her experience.

I have to say I'm not real happy with the way I have been treated the last few times here. I was having an asthma attack and the doctor had no clue what to do. The doctor released me when I should of been put in the hospital. I was at home after being released no longer then 30 min when I was rushed back not breathing and was put in the hospital. The first doctor should of taking better care of me and I should of never been released.

First time here and looks realy good and its in a nice little shopping center. The meatball sub was really good. The two girls that work here are very nice and helpful. They have a nice dessert selection. I will be coming back here to try out more of what they have. So far the food has been good I will update when I try more.

This was the first time eating here and my girlfriend and I realy enjoyed are food. I ordered lobster and steak and let me tell you it was awesome. I was impressed how the cook chose to throw out the first lobster do to he felt it was over cooked. The cook  also came to the table and made sure we where satisfied with the food which showed a lot about his love for the food he makes. After eating my delicious lobster and steak I got to experience for the first time fried cheese cake and ice cream and I will be coming back here to try more of the food for sure.

The teachers are very nice at this location and work with you. They will warm with you if you are having trouble financially. There is plenty of parking. The medical assistant program is hands on and they try and place you with a job after you graduate.
