Expectations for urgent cares are low and this one represents well.  I had an appointment at 11am for a pre-employment physical with two other people in the waiting room when I arrived. The lady at the desk probably doesn't care to work there much. She was rude, requested information from me, and did not say simple things such as please and thank you.  I was finally called back after an hour. They performed the needed tests, saw the doctor for 90 seconds, and I was done.  For what I needed done, it was the bare minimum. The wait time was dumb. Staff couple be happier. I left there in a bad mood. Happy Monday ya'll!

Everything I have had here is great. Breakfast buzz and protein burgers are a weekly staple in my diet. Staff is friendly. It can get crowded and limited parking. Must try and you will keep coming back for more!

I took my dog here to do a self-service bath.  When walking in, the place appeared messy and dirty. When assigned a bath tub, the receptionist pointed out the shampoo and conditioner (which is not marked and there were about 4 bottles on the shelf). They provide a scrubber, brushes for very long haired dogs, a 'blow dryer', and towels. The supplies were covered in previous dog hair. The bottom of the tubs were rusted. The sides of the tub could have been taller because my dog could have easily jumped out. The walls came up to above her knees (a lab/boxer mix) As I read in other reviews, the water temp was difficult to control.  The price was appropriate and it got the job done. The staff was fine. I would probably check out another place next time due to the cleanliness.

I've been here multiple times with mediocre experiences. The last visit was disappointing. My friend had a sudden urge to use the restroom where she vomited and had massive diarrhea. When we checked out and were asked how everything was, she kindly told them that something she ate quickly upset her stomach that led her to need the bathroom. The cashier said, "Oh, I'm sorry." We had to quickly leave before another episode would happen. I was very disappointed in the response we were given and unable to get ahold of a manager when I called to follow up.

Best bruschetta ever! The waitress was great. She allowed us to have a great dining experience without hovering and pushing us out of the place. Drinks were great. We went on a Saturday night and there was a live band. Would return!

The best thing about this place was our funny waiter. The fries texture felt like they were rolled in fur. Drinks were decent. Lamb was nothing special. One visit was enough.

Crossfit Blur is an energy filled environment that kicks your booty into gear!  When I initially met the trainers, I felt very comfortable and at ease with my fitness goals in their hands. The gym is unlike global gyms. It has a very open concept and simple equipment. They have little challenges within the gym that really motivate you to workout more in order to achieve your personal fitness goals.  I have been a member of LA Fitness and used to watch all the muscle heads walk around there. Crossfit Blur peeps are very easy going and everyone is welcoming of new members. We all remember our first day and it's great to see new people come so far doing Crossfit.  I highly recommend trying the gym out and bring a friend. I have been a member for 7 months now (they've been open for 9) and am not interested in looking anywhere else. They have free classes on Saturday! Here's their website: http://www.crossfitblur.com/#!home|mainPage  Like them on facebook! :)

Service was great. Food amazing. We had the pork shoulder tostadas, bone marrow, and duck entree. Waitress was very knowledgable of food and had great recommendations. I would certainly return.
