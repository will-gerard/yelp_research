If old people know breakfast then when you walk in you realize this must be the right place. We were seated immediately and the service was just as fast. The food came almost as quick as McDonald's but it was real food.   They have 22 different toppings for the pancakes. From Craisons to peaches, Oreos to trail mix and they finish off the list with whatever. They have a fairly big menu with what seemed like many original dishes.  I ordered the Power house. Some skillet type thing with chicken, jalapenos, onions with pico de gallo and salsa. It came with sour dough toast and I had a side of petite pancakes. The side of black beans on the side mixed with pico looked gross but they were very good. The petite pancakes were huge and they were good. Simple, fluffy and tasty. I tackled them first and tried the skillet after. I simply couldn't finish it all but it was good.  The wife ordered the Crabby One crepes. Crab as you could guess, brie cheese, spinach, shrimp and mushrooms topped with hollandaise sauce. She said this was quite good, especially once you got into the brie.  The tea came with a large carafe and two tea bags. Nice touch if they are not going to serve loose leaf. It was more tea than I wanted so that was a nice feeling.  It couldn't be classified as cheap for $34 but it was pretty good. One of the few places we ate at in Scottsdale that I would go back to.  By the way, it seems that old people must know breakfast!!!

We sat in the lounge because the Colts were playing the Cardinals and found a table with a great view of the many TVs. That was probably the best thing about the evening.  The corn chips were warm and fresh but unfortunately only came in a very small soup bowl. We did order more and they came but at the same time as our food.  We had to order pico de gallo as the complimentary chips only came with salsa. The pico de gallo was ok but not fresh and not worth ordering. The salsa was interesting. Not my favorite, but at least tasted fresh.  I had a miller sharps and I don't think I have ever had a colder "beer". Of course Miller Sharps is nonalcoholic but either way, very nice and cold.  I ordered the carne asada. It was not real flavorful. It was tender and good but not great. It actually tasted like a decent steak but I wanted that special spice that makes it Mexican carne asada. It did not have it.  My wife had the beef carne picado and you should too...if you like your dish to have two jalapenos to each piece of tasteless beef. I guess I can't say it was tasteless, it tasted boiled to me. My wife ate most of it but the two little pieces i had were enough for me. I could only muster up enough courage to have on chunk of jalapeno as well. I really enjoyed the re-fried beans that came with her meal. Unfortunately mine came with regular beans that were not that great.   The service was very good. Pleasant, quick and friendly.  I wont go back, I wish I had read some of the reviews first.

After spending a few days in the general Phoenix area I was very pleasantly surprised to see this part of town. Finally some grass and clean neighborhoods. We did go to Old Scottsdale for supper but that was at night and it wasn't this nice. We came here for breakfast because, well... its the The Breakfast Club.   We decided to sit outside on their patio which was nice, even though it was literally along the road. A little noisy and next time I would sit on the other side of the building but nice anyway.  The service was prompt and we were sitting within seconds of arrival.  The menu was good. There were quite a few interesting things that you may not see on another menu. After careful deliberation we tried the Asparagus, Ham, Cheese and Onion custom omelet along with the Mignon Benedict for myself. On the menu as "Mignon with Harris Ranch Filet, Saut√©ed Spinach, Bordelaise & Hollandaise"  I thought what a great idea, Eggs Benny with a steak and to boot I had it with shredded hash browns. The hash browns were deliciously crispy and the fresh fruit on the side was good. I ordered the sauces on the side which I would do again but this was quite good. Tender steak, spicy hollandaise and some kind of mushroom sauce. I would order this again.  My wife enjoyed the omelet and it did look good although I didn't try it. the idea of asparagus with eggs didn't really appeal to me. She said the exact opposite in fact, declaring that she loved asparagus in omelets. Maybe some other time for me.   Any way, this is the first place in Scottsdale / Phoenix that I ate at and would recommend or return to. Pretty darn good.

The decor was that of a 50's Mexican diner if there is such a thing. We hadn't even sat down when the chips and salsa arrived. That was nice.  As usual, we ordered pico de gallo for the chips which was just ok. Not fresh made but at least not out of a jar like the salsa tasted. We had the steak fajitas. I can't say anything nice about it. It was the same plain, bland fajita that you can order at any chain store across Canada or the USA.  The service was good but not enough to bring me back.  I think this is the step between Taco Time and an authentic Mexican restaurant. You should skip this place.

We decided to sit outside because the night was so nice. The "patio" was along side the road and speakers filled the night with really, really loud music. It was so loud it was kind of funny. We couldn't hear the waitress or each other sometimes. A nice touch but a little over done.   We had the crispy soft shell crab as a starter. I took one bite and the wife took about six. The rest stayed on the plate. Don't order this.   The Ultimate Shrimp Tempura arrived next. It was pretty good, something I would order again. It would have been better with a little tobiko but I suppose I am not really a sushi chef...   We had the Tunacado as well. The only thing wrong with this was that it wasn't double the size. The Tuna was fresh and so was the avocado. The sauce in the middle was really good.   The next thing to try was the Tuna Tataki. Being that the Tunacado was so good. For some reason it wasn't quite as good as the Tunacado. Must have been the sauce or something. It was still nice but the Tunacado is better.   We also ordered the Zonie roll. Spicy Salmon (which we substituted Ahi for), cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno and topped with avocado and sriracha. After I ordered it I decided to Google sriracha. Turns out its Thai hot sauce. The Thai know how to do hot. I enjoyed it but it only came with a dab on each piece of the roll and any more would have been overpowering. I really liked the fact that we could substitute the salmon out and the Ahi was great.  Maybe I am a sushi chef after all...

We were told about the neat shops in Cave Creek and that we had to go. We decided to spend an afternoon in the 104 heat walking from shop to shop to look at seriously over priced western furniture. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  We drove through most of the shops and restaurants to see what was available and after stopping at one that was closed for lunch, we picked the Horny toad.  The rustic atmosphere is the first thing you notice. It is kind of like an old mine shaft thing, except it had windows. Different at least.  They had three kinds of nonalcoholic beer on the menu so I was happy right away. My wife had some trendy sarsaparilla.  I ordered a cheese crisp which was a corn tortilla baked with cheese, onions and tomatoes. It came with a side of salsa and for $1.25 I think this may be the best appetizer I have ever had. What a simple idea. It was a taco shell broke in half with lots of melted cheese and a few onions and tomatoes. Dump a little salsa on it and wow, its great.  We also had an order of hot wings. They were OK but I would try many things on the menu before I ordered them again. They smelt great, hot and vinegary but the taste was a little bland. The more I ate, the better they got though. Kind of a buttery, spicy vinegar taste. Like I said though, just OK. The home made blue cheese was a nice dip and it was too bad we only got two pieces of celery.  I ordered the half rack of BBQ pork ribs. When I asked if I could switch the fries for onion rings I got a flat out no. I thought for a small charge this may be possible. I did get the pound of ribs I was promised so I can't complain about that. The ribs were average. They were BBQ'd at least, not boiled like some places. I'm not sure what this place is "known" for but non of the things I tried will bring me back.  My wife had the Broiled Icelandic cod which she ate about four bites. Seriously, there was so much left on the plate that when the waiter came and picked up the plates I couldn't believe he never asked if it was OK. It was broiled with some onions and some kind of powdered cheese or something. Anyway, skip it.  While we were there, another table proclaimed loudly that the service and the meal were absolutely excellent. We had the same waiter and he was certainly friendly but good at best. Not sure what they ate but I can be sure it wasn't what we had. I'll miss this one next time I'm in town.

It seemed like we drove for quite a while from Old Scottsdale for some Mexican food. At least it was very busy, so that was a good sign. We were greeted and seated within seconds while our drinks and free chips with salsa followed soon after. I can't say I love the flour chips mixed in with the corn chips but the salsa was quite good with either of them. We lapped up the small dish they gave us and asked for more. They brought a huge bowl and we ate it too. We also ordered pico de gallo for the chips. It was very good as well and I found myself mixing the two on my chips.   We had the Carne Asada which came with vegetables and rice. I had a side of re fried beans because Carne Asada seems to go with re fried beans for me. The steak was a real steak, no skirt steak here. It was quite good and it had all the "Mexican" flavor that I was hoping for. Cooked to order and seasoned deliciously, this steak is worth coming back for. The beans were ok, just re fried beans and not worth ordering as a side. The vegetables were just that, but it was all worth every penny because of the steak.   The waitress suggested the honey flan with caramel sauce and whip cream as it was her favorite. I'm not sure I've ever had flan but it was delicious. The dessert was kind of like a thick pudding but I loved the texture and I loved the taste. I thought I was too full for desert but I finished this.  The service was very good and it was very quick. The whole meal for two came in at $45. Nice place to eat.

We don't have this fast food restaurant in Canada so I had to come back here after a stop in Montana three years ago. I remembered the burger to be delicious. I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good.  I had the original burger and the onion rings. I can say that while I ate every last ring, they were good but certainly not great. I had the burger the way it came and maybe I added bacon last time. It was good, I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint. Its not going to unseat the Big Mac or even the Quarter Pounder in my mind but it was good. I think maybe i could eat here once a month, tops.  My wife had the Guacamole and Bacon burger. She really loved it. I don't know, not my thing but she insisted I try it. After saying no thank you at least six times I finally graciously accepted a bite. Like I said, not my thing.  She also had a creamsicle milkshake which tasted just like a creamsicle. Again she enjoyed it.
