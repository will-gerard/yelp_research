Best restaurant in Phoenix. Having moved to Phoenix from New Jersey a year ago, I was getting nervous about not being able to find a restaurant that came close to what I was accustomed to back east. Amano's exceeded every expectation. I am just mad at myself for not trying them sooner.

Haven't been back here for a while. Went on Friday, horrendous service, no silverware, no water, no order taking, no one brought our check to the table, when they finally did, no one came to pick it up. Seemed like they were too busy with other things. Food was decent, but after the service we got, seemed horrible. No management whatsoever! What a shame!

I must say that after my second visit to Gene' s in two years, I find him to be the most honest and knowledgeable mechanic in the valley. If you live  anywhere in the valley, and want a "REAL AND HINEST"  mechanic, make the trip to Gene's. You won't regret it. Forget the big O,'s and discount tire upsellers!!!

Just had our iron door installed today. WOW!!!! What a door!! Beautiful, plus professional installation. We got the door only, no jamb, to replace our existing front door. Price, quality, professionalism, you can't go wrong with Allied Gate!! Thanks Allied Gate!!!
