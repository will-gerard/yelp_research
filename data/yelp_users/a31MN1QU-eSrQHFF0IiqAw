After bowling at a few other alleys and being disappointed with their customer service, my husband and I decided to come here and check it out.  The first time we bowled here we knew this would be our go to alley to bowl at! We got the summer passes and have been here multiple times a week for a few weeks now and every time we've had a blast! The lanes are clean and if you come in the morning it's generally kid free (nice for practice). Except for the one time they didn't have any lanes  because there was a field trip but that's understandable.  The staff are so incredibly nice, and always happy to help. The people who bowl here are great, and the pro shop is the best one we've been to. Everyone in the pro shop has been so helpful! They corrected my ball drilling from another pro shop who made it too tight. Jim in the pro shop also does private lessons; after one lesson my husband was throwing a more consistent ball every time, he also gave him some excellent pointers. This is the best alley in the area, we love it!!

After I flew back into town my husband and I decided to go here for lunch, since it was close to the airport and the food was excellent (up until this visit)  I ordered biscuits with the chicken gravy, my husband had chicken and waffles and we got a banana pudding to go.  We got home and we both felt kind of off, nothing major. Then around 6pm we decided to eat the banana pudding that we got earlier, yes it was refrigerated the whole time. Maybe a half hour after that I was bent over a toilet puking my guts out and dry heaving. This continued the whole night and I had to call in sick at my job. I ended up going to urgent care because it was so bad. There was really nothing they could do but give me anti nausea medication and make sure I wasn't dehydrated. I had full blown food poisoning.  Here's the part that makes me not want to EVER return here; my husband called the establishment and asked for the manager, when he told the manager I had food poising and was really sick, HE HUNG UP.  So instead of saying he'd look into it or he would check the batch of pudding or gravy , HE HUNG UP. Really good customer service right there. Not to mention how sketchy that is for not owning up and being professional about it.  So we called the Heath department and they said there have been multiple cases of food poisoning in the area....  This was the only meal I had eaten that day, so I know it wasn't something else. I won't ever come back to this location, and I'm cautions about the ones in better neighborhoods. After missing a day of work and sitting in the bathroom puking for hours, this place wasn't worth it. Stay away!

Facilities are nice, pro shop is WONDERFUL but don't bother coming on league nights, if at all.  We were constantly insulted by a few members of the league next to us. We left after the first game because after spending $400 we had such an unpleasant time. We bowl frequently and know what "lane courtesy" is but apparently the leagues think they're beyond that. They lost our business permanently. We will be going to uptown alley now, because they actually care about their customers.

I stopped coming to this Safeway for multiple reasons, I only kept coming back because it's the closest Starbucks. After today I won't be coming back period.  My caramel macchiato had absolutely no caramel in it.  The cashier was snooty, I believe her name was Shaylie.  I think they should actually properly train their baristas like a regular Starbucks would because I've had my drinks screwed up and half a**ed continuously and they're never friendly.  This is the closest grocery store to me and I'll happily be going out of my way to go elsewhere.

Every time I come her thinking my experience will be better, it just gets worse.  The place is filthy, clothing is damaged and the staff is rude.  There was one cashier working trying to check everyone out quickly, when she called for back up someone finally showed up 5 minutes later and seemed inconvenienced that she had to actually do her job.  I was standing in the customer service line because there was ONE cashier and she said to wait there.  When the other girl showed up she took the people behind me in another line when I had been there waiting before them. Then she called me over and said "you're standing in the return line, just so you know".  And normally I would've just smiled and said sorry but when there was ONE cashier ringing people up there what else was I supposed to do? That was totally unprofessional and absolutely rude. I'll be going out of my way to shop at a different Ross because this place is a disaster. Not worth the hassle, plus the socks I bought had a giant hole in the foot.

I go to this location a few times a week being that it is closest to where I live and work. Normally I go here and have no issues, the staff is fast and friendly and they almost always get the order right. However, I went here today and I think it's safe to say I won't be back even though it's the closest dunkin to me.  My husband and I went in (we're the only ones in the store) and waited 4 minutes before anyone even spoke to us and took our order. To which the 'shift lead' Kyle I believe walked right past us, and didn't say a word.  Finally a young kid came out and took our order, but didn't ring it up (so I waited to pay and receive my order) and took 10 minutes to make 2 coffees and grab a donut. I wasn't rang up until after he had remade one of the coffees, and had to remind him to grab the right donut.  They were only focusing on the drive through when they also had customers inside the store with a very simple (but apparently complex) order of two coffees and a donut.  I'm very dissatisfied with the customer service received, or lack of. Especially from a manager. That is not only completely unprofessional but also unacceptable from management. That itself is why I will not be back to this location.

This is hands down the BEST gyro place in town. The gyros are very generously portioned, the meat is very fresh and tender.  The owner served us today, which is something you don't see that often. The staff is nice and it's a great atmosphere! We live closer to two different gyro places but this is definitely worth the drive!

Traci is the BEST. She's so sweet and does an amazing job. She's also super gentle. I don't think I'll go anywhere else to get my nails done at all!  She does so much creative nail art but also rocks the simple and classy such as a French manicure.
