One of our fav date night stops. We get cheese fondue, white chocolate martinis and chocolate fondue. Tonight we were there for cheese and one drink only. We sat at the bar, and The bartender was great. He made us white chocolate martinis even though they were not on the drink menu. He also gave us drinks and fondue at happy hour prices. Wow, we didn't even realize that there was happy hour pricing so that was a great surprise for us and then an extra large tip for him.

The people at this store are very rude, they have long wait times and don't care about customer service. I got my son an iPhone 6s 64 gig for Christmas. The phone is defective (shuts off every hour or so). I called customer service and they let me know returning it to the store was the best/fastest way to handle the exchange. They told me they would do it but it would cost an extra $100 because I got the phone in a special deal online at verizonwireless.com. They gave me no options except to charge me an extra $100. The store manager said her hands were tied because there was an issue in the system. After 90 minutes, we left without a phone and very dissatisfied. I've contacted Verizon through Twitter and they are trying to solve the issue and coordinate an exchange with the store. After calling to see if they had the phone in stock, the manager was again rude. I just don't get it. Why are they being rude to a business and personal client???

I've gone to Fusion Nails for 4 years. Over the years, I've learned to only go to Lynn as my nail tech. She is fast and does fantastic work. Each time I've had to go to someone else, it was terrible. Call ahead and make an appt with Lynn. She gets 5 stars, the salon 3 so I settled on 4.

We have visited this location at least 10 times over the last 2 years. We came in this time for ice cream for my husband and daughter. My other daughter tried one flavor of frozen yogurt but decided not to get any. I paid and then asked for the receipt because it seemed high for 2 yogurts. There was a $1.00 charge called custom. I asked the young cashier what the fee was for. She said, "well your daughter sampled without buying so I charged you."  I asked her to please tell people on the future. It is deceiving to charge people without explaining. I understand people taking advantage of the samples, and that was not our situation.  We will visit the other local frozen yogurt stores in the future.

Husband and I visited for a special date night. The whole experience was good, but the 5 stars is specifically for the ribeye steak. I ordered it medium rare. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. Extremely juicy and charred just right. If you go, get the ribeye!

Love Scott, his company and service. He has been our carpet guy for 6 years. The carpets are always clean and smell fantastic. We've recommended him to multiple people, and they have all been thrilled with his service. Small, locally owned company and they show up at the time they tell you (instead of a window). The prices are really great as well!

I have a very restrictive diet right now. They completely accommodated me by making a meal not even on the menu (grilled chicken breast with saut√©ed veggies and no butter). Not only that but it was delicious. Service was very fast. Thank you!

This is my "go to" for a healthy, paleo friendly lunch spot. The salads and bowls are both delicious and fresh. The juices are fantastic and made right in front of you.

Really great local salad/sandwich deli. The owner is great and always available for a chat. They walked me through the entire menu. Wifi was available, and I was able to meet a colleague there for lunch and get work done. Please visit and keep this local place in business!

A fun place for a treat on a hot day. Ice treats stuffed with ice cream and yummy toppings. I got peach stuffed with vanilla ice cream and topped with sweet cream, this was a recommendation of the owner. It's delicious. My kids also loved it. They got blue raspberry stuffed with vanilla ice cream and sprinkles and also pina colada stuffed with ice cream and sprinkles. The decor is fun also.

This is my very favorite burrito place. It's locally owned with family recipes and HOMEMADE tortillas made right in front of customers. Mario, Gilbert, Darcey and the team are amazing. Such a wonderful addition to the Chandler community. The green chili verde burrito is top notch.

I stayed at the Scottsdale Resort and this is the main restaurant. I ate breakfast here twice and dinner once. Joseph was my server each time and he was fantastic.   Dinner was a 5+. I got the weekly specials (Sun-Thurs). $19 for the special of the week and includes a beer or glass of wine. I had trout with a cream sauce, roasted veggies and wild rice. Served with a flatbread with caramelized onions and grilled tomatoes.   Breakfasts were 3.5. Service was excellent as was the vanilla lattes. The main dishes are overpriced for breakfast and just not that great. Opt for the breakfast restaurant on the 3rd floor instead where the prices are a bit better and there is a buffet option.
