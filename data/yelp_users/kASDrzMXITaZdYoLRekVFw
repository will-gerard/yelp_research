If you want top-notch service, this is the dealership where you should buy your next Porsche!  Go see Nick Amar and he will take great care of you.    We purchased our last Porsche from Nick and were so pleased that we brought our friends to see him and they purchased their first Porsche from him.  We have another couple getting ready to purchase a Porsche and we will be introducing them to Nick.    They have a huge selection of new and used Porsches!  We are from Tucson and feel it is well worth the two hour drive to purchase and have our car serviced at Porsche North Scottsdale. We have purchased several vehicles (Audi and Porsche) from the local Tucson Porsche/Audi dealership and will never deal with them again.

Okay, we go here a lot because its just down the road from my mom's house and its convenient. But every time I leave, I say I'm never coming here again.  This time I mean it, I will drive the extra 10-15 miles to eat somewhere decent.  If you just want eggs and toast, fine - hard to mess that up.  If you're wanting a bit more, go somewhere else.    The food is below average and the service is just bad.   This place used to be good years ago when the original owners first opened it and they also owned the Feed Bag in Apache Junction.  Now I believe this place is run by the 3rd owners and it has definitely went dowhill.  The decor has not changed since the place was built.

This review is only for the food and drinks on the patio.  The view is beautiful!  But the food and drinks were lame.    I used to work here in the late 80's and the kitchen was so filthy that I swore I would never eat there again (food was good back then) - I can tell you stories!  This past weekend we were at the Renaissance Festival and since my mom lives near the resort  we thought we would give it a try on the way to her house. I don't know if the kitchen is clean (one would hope) but the food quality is definitely poor.

I really like this place! Since we live in Tucson and my mom lives in Gold Canyon, this is my girls and I favorite place to dine when we're in the area.  I have never had a bad meal here! The service is usually pretty good but sometimes you have to ask more than once for something.   I think they have the best green corn tamales I've ever had! (way better than Tucson Tamale Company's tamales)    The patio is very nice and large so the tables are not jammed together. They have a full bar and the margaritas are YuMmY.

I have eaten here on three different occasions.  The first two times I would have rated them with 3 stars.  This last time I am being generous with 2 stars.  The food was mediocre but the drinks were good. Service was slow.  Our food came out and it was lukewarm. The rice had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. My husband had ordered a chimi and it was soggy.   I really like the salsa selections with the chips.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this jewelry store!  If you like one of a kind, unique pieces of jewelry - this is your place.  If I win the lottery, a majority of my winnings will be spent in this store!  The staff are knowledgeable, friendly and extremely nice.  If you are looking to have a custom piece made, this is the place to go.

I really like this venue.  I've been here for a couple shows and I like the intimate feel of the theater.  My only complaint - the bar situation.  Two bartenders is not enough to serve all those people!  There is a parking garage across the street so parking is not a problem.  It is located within walking distance of hotels, bars, and restaurants.

I cannot count the number of times I have been on the Dolly Steamboat and I enjoy it each and every time.  This last time, I actually got to see the mountain sheep - finally after 30 years!   Super easy to book/pay online and then you are guaranteed a spot which is especially important in the winter time when the winter visitors are here.  The twilight cruise is breathtaking with the vibrant colors of the Arizona sunset.  You will not be disappointed and this cruise is good for all ages.

The food is 5 star quality; however I have been coming here for 25 years and the decor has not changed - it is getting a bit tired looking.  I would take away a star for the decor if the food wasn't so darn yummy.  The food is AMAZING!  My favorite is the jaeger schnitzel and I highly recommend it. The soups change daily and I have never had a bad soup - even soups that I normally don't care for are wonderful here.  I always get the soup instead of the salad bar because you can eat salad anywhere, right?  If you are a vegetarian, this is NOT the place for you!  If you are watching your caloric intake, this is NOT the place for you!    You know how they say you eat Chinese food and 30 minutes later you're hungry? When you eat German food, 72 hours later you are hungry!  German food is heavy and rich.

I've been going to this place for YEARS!  I miss it so much now that I live in Tucson.  They have great pizza and garlic bread.  My favorite pizza is meatball with tomato (cooked, not added after pizza comes out of the oven).  My mouth is watering just thinking about this pizza.  Mmmmmm.......

I know this is an iconic restaurant in Scottsdale and was hoping for much more. There are only a few flavors of ice cream.  While the Top Hat sundae and the malt were good, the ice cream cone was just so-so. The ice cream does not taste home made - I'm guessing Blue Bell???  The decor is tired - I remember this restaurant looking exactly the same way 25 years ago!  The service was poor and our waitress barely spoke above a whisper.

My husband, mom and I came here after hearing from a vegan friend how wonderful it is and seeing the great reviews on Yelp.    We decided to order a variety of appetizers and planned on ordering our main entrees after the appetizers.  However we were so disappointed at the quality of the appetizers that we decided we had tried enough and left.  We had the samosas, buffalo wings, tofu satay with peanut sauce, and eggless rolls. The buffalo wings bordered on disgusting.  I was so disappointed because that is my favorite item to order when eating at Veggie Grill ( CA locations) or Native Caf√© (locations in CA and other states). Green -  you need to take a lesson from either one of those two restaurants on how to make amazing buffalo wings!!! The remaining appetizers were just okay, not great.   About an hour after we ate, all three of us were having tummy issues and making emergency trips to the bathroom.   I really wanted to love this place as it is hard to find Vegan restaurants!

Wow! We found this restaurant on Yelp and we were not let down!  This is a tiny place and it gets PACKED with people lining out the door for lunch so get there early if you want to be seated right away.  We had the fried tofu and I wouldn't get it again as it was bland but the rest of the food we ordered was fantastic.  We are vegan and they accommodated us by leaving out the egg and offered tofu as a protein.  We had the vegetable fried rice and the coconut curry.  We asked for it to be "very spicy, Thai spicy" and she said "we can make it a 5 or double, triple or even quadruple that" so we asked for it to be "double" and it had just the right amount of heat for us.  We will be returning!

What a disappointment. I've watched Pawn Stars for years and thought this would be a fun thing to do and see. We took the monorail to the end of the line and was lucky to find a taxi to take us the remainder of the way. We arrived about 8:45 and there was a line of 30+ people already! I thought it was open 24 hours a day but learned in line that the doors open at 9am for people to shop/see as the rest of the time its only open for people to pawn/sell.  We heard that there can be a wait sometimes 2-3 hours! I would have been very ticked off if I had waited that long to get in after I saw what was inside.  This place is a dump! The items in the cases are not displayed well, the cheesy signs "Item featured on Pawn Stars" are handwritten on dirty looking paper. The items that were in the case were so overpriced, you could buy them new for the same amount.   Do not waste your time and taxi money to come here! You will not see any of the Pawn Stars crew - we were told they come in early in the morning and leave before 9am unless they are filming.

I love this exhibit! I try to go every time I'm in Vegas as it changes all the time. I've went 6 months apart and there were many new wax figures - totally worth going every time. It's fun to see how big/small these famous people are as TV definitely skews your perception.

Located inside the New York New York hotel.  The food was just okay.  Since I live in Arizona and get great Mexican food, this place left little to be desired.  I thought the salsa was bland and they didn't have a spicier salsa available.  My girlfriends and I all had different entrees and we all agreed that the food was not very good.

We should have known that this buffet had gone downhill as there was no line at 11am - just when the lunch buffet was beginning!  This used to be so good and worth the wait. Now it is very mediocre and we will not be going back.

We happened to wander into this bar & restaurant and we are so glad we did! The outside is not very impressive but when you walk in, there is a HUGE bar!  The wait staff were super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The menu is your typical bar food menu but the food quality is not the normal bar food!  The portions were big - we had the waffle fries with cheese and I think this is the best cheesy fries I've ever had. They were crispy and the cheese was browned nicely. We also had the onion rings (very tasty) and spinach and artichoke dip was super delish.  We learned that they have live music every night except Monday. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Scottsdale.

We came here for breakfast one morning and it was yummy! I had a potato skillet (can't remember the name) and my mom had french toast. The food was made fresh and tasted great.    I've dined at other First Watch locations and have never been disappointed.

My husband and I stopped in here one night right before 11pm after a concert. We walked up to the door and saw the hours posted on the door saying they close at 11, so we turned around and started walking away when a waiter opens the door and tells us "We're open!" so we go inside.  I believe they're open until 2am on Saturday night.  We are vegan and this restaurant is not geared towards the vegan crowd; however, they do have a garden burger on their menu.  They were so kind to make vegetable fajitas for my husband.  There drinks were superb with the Cadillac margarita being one of the best my husband has had!  Tony was our server and he was amazing! We sure enjoyed talking with him.  He loves working there and was so enthusiastic about his job (his 2nd job for many years) and his family.   The atmosphere here is 2 stars but you need to overlook that.  The patio is way nicer than the inside.   Give this place a try and support a locally owned business in downtown Phoenix!

OMG! This place was ah-mazing!  Some of the best Chinese food ever!  We have stayed at the MGM many times but never tried this place - shame on us!  I had the Singapore noodles which had just the right amount of spice. My friends all ordered various items and everyone was very happy with their selections.

We've been here several times and we've never had a bad meal. The drinks are wonderful - my favorite is the French martini (I don't remember the full name but that is close).  We've tried quite a few items on the menu and the only one that was just ok is the fish tacos - they were strange because the piece of fish they used was so big.  The stuffed portabello is good, the street tacos are good, the beef & mushroom risotto was ok, the Krisi flatbread is AWESOME, and the bruschetta was good as well.    We will be going back for sure!

We attended this event today and loved it! The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded.   This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry, there will be food near by.  The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain.   There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy.

I have been here several times as a vegan and as a non-vegan and I have to say the food is amazing.  They have a separate vegan and/or vegetarian menu and you will not be disappointed!  They have a great selection of cocktails too!   This restaurant is located inside the Aria hotel on the strip.  It is always busy but I don't think I've ever had to wait more than a few minutes to get seated.  I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas!

Cool concept but the drinks tasted like they use poor ingredients and cheap liquor. Life is way to short to drink cheap liquor!  The food was just okay - nothing spectacular. I would not come back here again.  The server, Jeff,  was plain annoying and mostly a smart@ss. Do not sit in his section!

This is one of the few times Yelp has let me down. We love Caribbean food and was excited to try this after reading the good reviews.  I would give it zero stars if I could and I rarely feel that way about the restaurants we visit.  We arrived a few minutes before 11am and had to wait outside for it to open. At 11am, the owner opened the doors and let us in. The dining room lights were off and the blinds were closed so she began to open the blinds and turn on the lights. It was very hot in the dining room.  We assumed she had been in the back prepping food for opening but we assumed wrong - more about that later.  Another gentlemen walked in the same time as we did and while we were looking for the menu, he said he wanted a to-go order. He asked for a couple items but was told "we don't have" so he finally settled on jerk chicken.    I went up to order while other half went outside to sit at the table on the patio as it was way too hot to be inside. I too was told on several items that "we are out". I was ready to give up but finally settled on the jerk chicken and the chicken curry.   Now after reading the reviews, we were prepared to wait quite awhile for our food and was surprised when it arrived almost immediately.  The first bite I took of my curry - it was crystal clear that it was leftover as it was cold and the sauce was separating. Since I have no idea how long this leftover had been in the fridge, I opted to not eat it. The plantains were delish and the rice/beans were just okay (not much flavor).  My other half eat his plantains and rice and beans but was avoiding the jerk chicken so I asked him why. He said he didn't want to get food poisoning as we had a 2 hour drive back home! He did take one bite of the jerk chicken and said it was exactly as he thought it would be - reheated slightly, cold, very greasy and slimy on the outside.    Now we know that the owner was not in the back prepping food as she had just arrived minutes before unlocking the door!

Love this place! Wish we had one in Tucson. I've been here twice and both times it was amazing.  After eating here the first time, I actually crave it sometimes.  They were very accommodating to making our dishes vegan for my husband and I. The vegetable broth is very flavorful and I love the spicy mix they have by the soda fountain to add to your bowl.    The noodles were perfectly cooked and the vegetables were very fresh! My husband tried the seaweed salad too and said it was very good.  We will definitely be back!!!

OMG! This place was really good. Now I have been here and had awesome service and other times, the service has been really bad - like wait 45 minutes with only a few people in front of you bad.  I have been here at least 4 times and each time they have teenagers running the place with no supervision. Two times the teens were fast, friendly and provided great service and the other two times, I would have walked out if we didn't live in Tucson and were able to visit more often as my kids really like this place.  I love love the ice cream and I like how many flavor choices you get to create your very own unique flavor!  I wish it was open on Sundays as that is when we are in that area more often or hint hint - open a location in Tucson! Preferably the north area! :-)

I found this little gem of a place thanks to Yelp! What a find!  It definitely doesn't look like much from the outside but WOW the food was aaaahhhhmazing!  It is very small but if there is a line - it is worth the wait.  I had the Mornin' Monte and I highly recommend it. My friend had French toast and said it was delish. We both had the country potatoes which were good too.  I look forward to trying other items the next time I am in Chandler!

We had an awesome meal here.  The pretzel balls are so good - you need to try them! We also had the rock shrimp which was amazing. I don't even like shrimp!  We also shared the fish & chips and they did not disappoint us either.    I tried the Peppers & Peaches martini and it sounds weird but was strangely good - I wouldn't drink a lot of them but 1-2 is fine.    Now I wish Fox would open one in Tucson so we don't have to drive all the way to Phoenix to eat here!!!

I was excited to see this show after reading all the positive reviews - I was looking forward to a night of raunchy fun.   This show was not funny, not raunchy and the jokes were very lame. The hosts are annoying and the girl's voice (Penny?) is like fingernails on a chalkboard! Ugh, find someone else to tell the stupid jokes and do the stupid puppet show.I was not offended by the use of the "f" word - I use it quite frequently myself so that is not the reason I didn't like the show.   Some of the acts are impressive - the guy on the chairs was cool, roller skating duo was lame, bubble girl was lame and the body guards were very good. Tightrope guys were good too.  I just don't understand all the 5 star reviews. I was bored and tempted to walk out several times. My significant other slept thru most of the show if that is any indication of how "exciting" this show was!

Very small but clean place with vegan options. They give you a choice of spiciness on a scale of 1 - 5 with 5 being the most spicy.  I said "Make it a 10" as it cannot be too spicy for me.  My food came out and it was a 2 at best. Disappointing.  However, the food was delicious and I would definitely go back! The kitchen looked spotless (there is a window to watch them cook) and that is always a big plus for me

I found this gem of a place thanks to Yelp! I was needing to grab a quick bite before going to the Phoenix Children's Hospital as I did not want to waste good calories on bad food!  They are super super friendly here! The service is terrific - cannot ask for better.  I had a bacon cheeseburger with BBQ sauce and asked if they had fresh jalapenos (they did - yay!) and added at no extra charge. The burger is very large - I didn't try the fries. Everyone looked happy with their food and it all looked wonderful.  I would definitely go back if ever I'm in that part of Phoenix again.

O.M.G.!!! Hands down best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand!!!  Do not let the outside appearance scare you off  - as they say, you cannot judge a book by its cover and it is so true about this restaurant!!!  I was here with 3 of my friends for lunch on a Saturday, two of them had never eaten Thai food before.  We all loved it! Unfortunately for us we live in Tucson but we have all said we will be back!  I love love love spicy food so I was happy to see at the top of their menu they had a 0-5 spice level when ordering.  I told the waitress that I wanted my food to be a 10 if possible.  :-)  She said no problem and then came back to me after bringing our order to the kitchen and asked if I wanted my food "Thai style with Thai chilis"  - YES PLEASE!  Wow, I was so happy when I got my food!  The drunken noodles were amazing!  I can hardly wait to go back and take my husband this time.  This is a hidden gem for sure!

My girlfriends and I were in Vegas and heard about 80's Night with a Live Band karaoke on Tuesday nights.  It was so much fun! The band was pretty decent considering the some of the "singers" but we enjoyed ourselves and danced and danced.  It was Taco Tuesday so we had tacos and they were pretty good.  My only complaint - why are there no vegan/vegetarian tacos offered on the Taco Tuesday menu?

This was such a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  We decided to try a variety of items.    I ordered the "Freedom Toast" with "Spiced and Sliced" - it was just okay.  Definitely nothing to "bragg" about.  My husband ordered the "Frank Lloyd Bite".  His pancakes were very tasty - by far the best of all the food we tried. The hash browns were strange - how do you mess up hash browns? The biscuit and gravy was not very good at all as they were dry and not very flavorful.  The eggplant bacon was absolutely horrible!!!    We also ordered the vegan sausage patties and the jackfruit barbacoa - AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!  My husband takes one bite and says "Yuck. Here you try this! You can't believe how bad this is!" So I take a bite of each and he is not exaggerating, they are so disgusting.   As we are sitting there, we look up and notice the air intake for the A/C unit is covered in at least 1" of dirt/dust.  Ewwww!!!  The rest of the restaurant is "decorated" and I use that word loosely in funky d√©cor; especially the bathroom with the plastic/yarn items.  We both had upset stomachs after we left.  We will not be back.  I would give this place 0 stars if I could.

Okay I am giving this 1 star because of the shady business practice.  If I was rating the place on ambiance and drinks, it would be a 3-4 star.  We were approached in the casino to come "have a drink on us" and handed a card. Okay, why not? We were thirsty - it is Vegas after all!  :-)  When we get to the hostess stand, the hostess tells us "It's buy one get one with that card" - okay not a problem as we planned on having a couple drinks!  The waitress hands us an iPad that describes the drinks in detail and they all look yummy.  So hard to choose which one to start with!  At $18 each, we are expecting them to taste as awesome as their description.  When we go to order, our waitress informs us that the "buy one, get one" is only for well, select beer and wine.  I think this is total BS that the poor waitress has to inform us of this restriction.  Fortunately I had checked in on Yelp and they have an offer of "buy one, get one" with no restrictions so we used that coupon.  But we only had 1 drink and left.    Come on Fizz!  You lost money on that bogus "buy one, get one" as we would have stayed much longer and drank but this type of business practice is not cool.

Very few times Yelp has let us down when selecting a new restaurant to try but unfortunately this was one of them.  I do not know how this place can have 4 stars!  I am beginning to think these reviews are by people that do not know what good food is supposed to taste like.  First of all, both Yelp and their website states that they open at 8am. They open at 10am.  We live in Tucson so we were excited to try this place out on our way to Scottsdale. Not cool that they weren't open at 8am like stated.   My husband ordered the Vegan Breakfast Burrito and I ordered the My Favorite French Toast. We also ask if the jalapeno poppers are indeed jalapenos (not sure why my husband asked this question but I guess he had a feeling) and we were assured that they used jalapenos.  We also ordered a side of the apple Soyrizo hash.  Our food arrives and I wish I had taken a picture of my plate.  The description of my French toast reads: Creamy Coconut Custard| Berry Coulis| Cinnamon Sugar Bananas | House Granola Seasonal Fruit Side.  Yah right!  There was no sign of creamy coconut custard only two slices of barely buttered bread with a smear of berry and an entire whole banana with no cinnamon sugar laid across the dry bread.  It had no flavor, the whole banana was weird (should have been at least sliced) and was just not good.  The apple Soyrizo hash was soggy apples, soggy sweet potatoes and soggy white potatoes with no Soyrizo whatsoever.  This "hash" had zero flavor and after two bites, I couldn't force myself to take another bite.    My husband's burrito while looked like it should taste good was not.  He said he didn't know how they could have all these ingredients and not have any flavor.  He ate half of it because he was hungry but the rest of the day his stomach hurt.  The "jalapeno" poppers arrive and it is some sort of mixture on top of quartered red bell peppers! Now I am very allergic to bell peppers so we tell the server that we do not want this dish and since she had taken our order my husband reminded her that he had asked if they were in fact jalapenos.  She said "Oh yeah! I'm sorry. I can refund your money" and we took her up on that offer.

I have only tried the Banana Foster ice cream (must be over 21) and WOW IS IT GOOD!!!  Each time I go to Vegas, I make a point to stop in here.  There are probably 50 other flavors but I couldn't tell you if they are any good since I fell in love with the Banana Foster ice cream on my first visit.

This is the first festival of this type held in Arizona. A nice variety of vegan/vegetarian foods and booths.   I gave it 4 stars only because I feel $25 per person admission fee is a lot since there were only 30 booths.  Apparently there was a Groupon but we live in Tucson and wasn't aware of one available. My suggestion to the organizers of this event, please advertise in Tucson!  I will attend again next year to see if there is more participation.

Happened to find this gem on Yelp and was skeptical as there were only a few reviews. However, we learned that they had recently opened so thought we would give it a try.  I am so glad we did!    We are vegan and they were very accommodating to make our food vegan.  Everything we tried was outstanding!    The owner came over to ask if we liked everything and I said to him, "This is the 2nd best Thai food I've had in the Phoenix area.  The first is a little house that seats about 10 on Broadway in Phoenix" and before I could finish he said "Chan Pen?" and I said "That's it!" and he replies, "My aunty owns that.  She taught me to cook".  Well no wonder I liked Thai Season - that explains everything.

What a disappointment. Do not waste your time coming here unless you don't mind scratched, dented or dirty items.    We live 2 hours away, received an email this outlet was opening and we were so excited as we order from Frontgate quite often and like their products.    The store is huge but in total disarray and the only items I could find in perfect condition were the packaged sheets, towels and bath mats. There may have been some bar stools that were not banged up but by the time I got to that part of the store I was so unhappy by the offerings that I was more than ready to leave.  I couldn't believe that they would have rugs that were dirty and moldy on the showroom floor!   This is a high-rent area and with a store of 36,000 square feet, we expected this to be like every other outlet-type store we have shopped.
