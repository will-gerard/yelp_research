Nice place to have some beer especially before 5 since draft mini pitchers are $5 which gives you 2 pints to 2 1/2 pints all depends on the poor of the bartender. But it's nice just make sure to have some mosquito repellent or itch cream cause we got eaten by mosquitos while sitting outside when it is such a beautiful day!

Love this Place!!! The chef really knows what he is doing. It is always a hit every time I go there.  I truly love this place it is a great place for sushi! The Miso soup is awesome, my daughter sometimes can not get enough of it, I will admit sometimes neither can I.

Office is small it's weird, 80's feel and so is the doctor (Rosen). He kept pacing when we were talking to him before he gave us the paper work to fill out, he was making me nervous! I did not like that he charged me a $2.00 fee to run my visa!! Who does that anymore!?

Salsa is always good the hot & the mild. I wanted the machaca with an egg in a chimichanga rather then in a burrito, they did it and it was so good! Can't remember when I had a chimi (or anything fried) and this met my expectations and then some. Looking forward to next time.

I had a great time @ Romeo's Euro Cafe for his 3rd Tuesday, 3 wine pairing courses which included a salad, a main dish & the dessert that even impressed me, all for $30    I recommend doing this experience, we had a great time. The ambiance, the people combined with good food and wine was like having dinner with friends. We walked in as a two top but left as part of a large group that filled this little cafe. I am looking forward to next month!

It's a really nice place, clean, everyone is really nice. It wasn't that busy when I came but it was steady and still got my food pretty quick and nice & hot. My eggs were done how I asked them it was all very good. It's great to come to a place where the locals walk in and the staff knows them by name and chat with them even the newbies, like me, to make everyone feel at home.

Worst service, the food was not good either! The tortilla soup was so under seasoned! Do the have cooks, a chef who knows what salt and pepper are!

Wines was a great priest good selection too. During the happy hour I had the Ahi Poki that is perfect for one person especially me since I don't eat a whole lot. The deviled eggs were also a fav and a good price not too bad to share one ;-) lol

Atmosphere here is nice, live the Dia de Los Muertos theme they have going. Drinks are good, not much on draft but definitely a place where a majority of Scottsdale can get a taste of a variety of Mexican beer. The food, well the Duck tacos although good the menu should have read "Tapa's" or appetizer's $4 for 1 baby street taco. Not a good deal, not $4 worth either! If I go back ill make sure to eat somewhere else.

I love how it's a very "welcome, come relax & enjoy" feel to the outside area. The beats are great! For my bday not long ago I was brought here and had the chicken & waffles the last 2 years...... Never disappointed. Thanks for all the fun, great beer & awesome food!

Happy hour prices are great. But live music is better here. It is a great place even just to sit and have a couple of beers and relax.

Ok I have to give it the 5 Stars, our burgers, The Primetime & The Magic Shroom, were cooked right (mid rare) this time, everything was perfect. We are not dessert people (especially with a pastry chef in the house) but we're convinced to try a shake so we got the Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel shake and it was really good, not too sweet it was great with the little bits of crunch thru out. Definitely worth trying again. I appreciate the management inviting us back after our boy so great experience the last time, it was great. Also our waiter, Hashem was really awesome attentive and very nice. Look forward to next time.

Constantly good food, it's always hot and does not take a long time. This is the best place I have had Vietnamese food in a really long time. It was my best kept little secret but this is a gem that everyone should enjoy. I recommend everyone to try it at least once! Love at first bite.

Great mini pitchers for $5 everyday before 5pm! Awesome deal. The Roast Beef sandwich was amazing, the Turkey & the Autostrada (better w/out the spicy pepper relish for me) were really good as well. All sandwiches were big enough to split for us, all yummy to share

OMG so worth the drive from Old Town Scottsdale! This was the best "orange chicken" I have had anywhere in AZ!! I went for the Fried Steam Buns, if I could have only ate more, I would have kept ordering. Everything was so good, I got so caught up in the food I forgot to take a pic of the food. I am so looking forward to my next visit!

Our server, Erin, was a 4star rating but the food needs work. Once we ordered it took a very long time to get our food when other tables of 3 & 4 who arrived & ordered after us got their food before us-not good. Then to top it off our eggs were raw, runny is one thing but the whites were raw and the yolk on one of my eggs was also partially raw. We tried to get the attention of the manager (tall guy there) but he never came over to our table unless it was to check on the group of guys next to us. I loved it when it was The Orange Table, they may have the same menu but the quality has yet to be desired. I will give it one more chance, thanks to our server Erin, hopefully she will still be there.

Tried the Gringo Burrito & a side of plain potatoes and it was good, not greasy at all. But the Guava Mimosa's are fantastic! A must try next time I am going to try their signature Bloody Mary, the real thing looks just as amazing as the picture, definitely a meal in it self! Oh and our waitress Rosa was awesome!

We had the Malnati's salad that was the only thing that tasted good coming out of the kitchen. We ordered the Malnati's Chicago Deep Dish, a sausage and spinach deep dish and a thin crust pizza and we could not figure out if it was the cheese or the sauce that just didn't taste quite right. Something was off and the waitstaff just told us it must be our taste buds that differed from theirs (the restaurant) but 6 people, 3 of whom are chefs and the others of FOH & 1 food writer I believe we have a good idea of how things should taste. But somehow all 6 of us had it wrong. Needless to say, if I do go back it will be only because I could not get out of a family gathering and I will not eat anything unless it's from the bar .
