Great customer service, very prompt and efficient. Nicole is very pleasant and on top of things!  Awesome location right on the greenbelt, plenty of parking and the property is very clean!  Only downfall, we live on the first floor, so can hear the people walking above us and some items in the apartment (i.e. refrigerator, blinds, shower) are a bit outdated. But the front office said they would happily replace anything that needs fixing!

Amazing food and great friendly customer service. Family owned and operated from chicago. High quality home style eats. I love this place! Hummus, house salad with village dressing and falafel pita are my faves!

I have been here plenty of times and the food is always great and service is spot on! They will accommodate special requests with no problem! I love the Tom Yum soup, and they were kind enough to make it vegetarian and add noodles! Also the green curry and red curry are favorites, along with the coconut mango sticky rice for dessert!

Apartments seem nice and located right on the greenbelt near old town scottsdale. But I have never dealt with worse customer service in all the apartments I have rented. I came in on a saturday and waited 20 minutes to talk to the only employee who was working. He was casually taking his time with the couple, which is to be expected, but failed to greet me or offer any literature while I waited. After showing them the model, he went on to talk about his favorite foods and his trips overseas, without any sense of urgency to help me out. Then when they finally left, he answered the phone and tended to other tenants who had walked in, not giving me any attention at all. There was no follow up after I was shown the model. Since I liked the location I figured I would move there. Every time I called, I had to leave a message, no one answered the phone. It would take a day or two for him to get back to me. I handed in my application, and a girl called me back that day. I was very happy that she seemed much more in to customer service than the man. But that was all. She said she would call back in two days after the application process came back. She did not. I called the next day, and of course had to leave a message. She never returned my call. I had to call a couple more times to get a hold of her. She sent me the lease via email and the dates were wrong, so i emailed her back. She never returned my emails. I told her I wanted to see the apartment the day before I moved in to make sure it was what I wanted before signing the lease. She never called, nor returned my messages and emails asking for this. I got her temporary assistant on the line who said there was nothing she could do, as the manager had gone home for the day.  So the day I was suppose to move in, I went to another complex. I figured if the customer service was this lousy as a perspective customer, how would it be if I ever needed something fixed, or anything else I was having problems with. Within 2 hours, I had looked at an apartment, filled the application, signed the lease, and moved in! The best thing about Chazal, besides the location, is how good it makes other apartment properties look! Oh, and of course, I never had any sort of follow up to ask why I hadn't moved in the day I was suppose to from Chazal....

The food is good, service is ok. I waited 20min for a toasted bagel with cream cheese, lettuce, tomato and avocado. For the bagel and a juice, the cost was $15. A bit pricey I think. The last time I went, I ordered two sandwiches to go. The wait was again extremely long. And when I finally got around to eating my sandwich a few hours later, they had put the side of fruit underneath the sandwich so the bread was really soggy.  I won't be going back
