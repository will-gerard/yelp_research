Great choice near the Charlotte airport.  Clean, comfy beds - new and/or well maintained facility - delicious breakfast, and reasonably priced for all that you get.  Fortunately at HS you can get dinner, which is necessary here because there isn't that much too choose from nearby.

How in the world is this place a preferred property on our corporate travel site?  Two theories: either our company had its sales meeting here within the last 5 years and negotiated the sweet rate (which is possible, since it's our brand of paper products in the bathrooms), or it was August and no one goes to the Arizona resorts in August due to the heat and/or potential for monsoon weather.  I stayed in the villas, which were very nice.  Each room had a kitchenette with sink, fridge, and microwave.  The beds, covered with crisp, white linens, were quite comfy, with lots of fluffy pillows.  The bathrooms were nice and new.  Only odd thing was that the window to the outer hallway (down which all the guests walk to enter their rooms) was in the shower.  High speed internet access was free and easy, and the TV was a new hi-def flat panel.  Our sweet room rate also included breakfast in the lobby grill, overlooking the golf course (the tee on the island).  The breakfast included had plenty to choose from: two eggs, choice of meat, choice of bread, and hashbrowns.  All was quite tasty, particularly the array of jams that came with the bread: jalapeno strawberry, pear and rosemary, and blueberry.  My favorite was the pear and rosemary, but I did have second bites of all of them.  After nights of heavy food, my coworker opted for the fruit plate instead of the included breakfast, and by the time he got fruit, coffee, bread, and OJ, it ended up costing him $30!!  That's a little steep for a la carte.  The staff was friendly enough, though it was annoying to have to keep valeting the car since there wasn't ready parking by the lobby.  Also, when we checked out a 5am on Friday morning, we weren't the only ones, and none of our bills had been pre-printed, even though that must be something they do since the woman behind the counter asked us if they were correct.  Would I stay here again?  Maybe if I had more time to take advantage of the amenities.  Otherwise, I'll probably try to find somewhere nearby with hotel points.

Please note the date of this original review (4/09) and that it is prior to closure, renovation, and reopening with same name and sign.  Based on reading the reviews of Charlotte Yelpers (instead of out of town guest Yelpers), if you find this review appealing, you should head to Diamond or Pinky's. (1/11).  -----  I knew it had to be good when our friend reminded us every five minutes (revelry-induced short-term memory loss) the night before that we'd be going to Penguin and we had to be there right at 11 to avoid the crowds.  Sure enough, at 11:05, there were already folks there, and by 11:15, all the tables were full.  Fortunately we got the corner booth.  We were waited on by at least 3 servers - great team work guys!    I was the only one bold enough to start with a beer - the rest of them are Carolina kids who can't stand the thought of not ordering Cheerwine in the bottle - and the waiter said that he'd like one as well, so I knew I was going to like this place.  We got an order of the sweet potato fries and the fried pickles to start.  The sweet potato fries were a little on the dry side, which I would actually consider a good thing, since that means they weren't too greasy.  The fried pickles were a little on the floppy/soggy side and over-battered.  The first few were great, but we should have stuck with the small order, since the last ones to be eaten were not as good as the first.  This place is so cheap!  Maybe I'm just used to high Atlanta prices, but everything seemed to be so generous for the price!  I opted for the pimento cheese, which ended up being a little too rich for my stomach after all the sp fries and the fried pickles, but I still managed to snag a few bites of Jimmy's corn dog, which was on the sweet side, but still excellent mustard.  Some days you just want burgers and corn dogs.  Most days I want fried pickles.  Will we be back?  Definitely, and promptly when the doors open.

I've been renting for years at this Hertz with no problems, even got some nicer cars like a Prius (which I love since it's my personal car, and that makes it easier to remember where you parked and how to handle the car).  But my most recent rental was quite the ordeal.  As a gold member, all I had to do was pull up to the exit for them to print my contract.  However, when I did, I was told that the car was on rental hold.  The guy politely explained that all I had to do was drive through the gate, drop off that car, and then pick any car from the gold area for the same price.    Unfortunately, once you pull through the gate, there are no signs to explain where you should park.  And none of the other employees was as nice as the guy at the exit.  When I tried to park in the return area, the guy at that counter condescendingly asked why I thought I should return a clean car to the return area, then only pointed out the customer loading zone where I was supposed to be after much prodding.  Once I got there, there was no one to take the car or the keys. And it seemed that every car in the Gold Choice area had a name already assigned to it... but that could've just been me, since I didn't really know where I was going.  So I just went back to the counter inside, where I had to wait in line again, and then was given a car that was $50 more than the rate that I was quoted for the other...  I'll stick with Hertz while the company is paying, but I'm looking elsewhere when it's my own dime.

We were walking around Old Scottsdale, trying to settle on a place to get a relatively quick bite.  When our first choices were further away than anticipated, we opted for Old Tortilla Factory, thinking from the description that it might be a tad kitschy.  When we saw the patio, we thought, "not too bad" and decided to stay.  Unlike the other reviewers, our server was friendly and helpful and attentive to our requests.  I was not, however, terribly impressed by the food, even those famous tortillas.   We started with the queso fundido, which was very watery, and not nearly as flavorful as I'd expect.  This was served along side some red pepper tortillas with jalapeno butter.  The butter was good.  The tortillas were ok, a little on the dense/doughy side for my liking.  Admittedly, I prefer corn, so I was biased from the start, but they tasted just like any other flour tortillas I could find at a supermarket.  For the mains, we got the chicken calabacitas and the pork chile verdes.  The sauce on the chicken was the highlight of my meal - creamy, garlicky, full of flavor.  The chicken underneath was moist, and the accompanying relish was quite tasty.  The pork chile verdes was disappointing.  The pork was dry, the sauce was watery, the potatoes undercooked.  Definitely not worth it.  The drinks were good.  The patio atmosphere was relaxing.  But the food wasn't worth the cost.

When I asked the vendor to pick somewhere "local" for dinner, he suggested Four Peaks as a fun college place.  Sure enough, this is the kind of place college kids would love - lots of beer and huge portions of classic bar food.  While we were waiting for some others, the server suggested the nachos for the table.  The nachos came piled high on a double plate, with heaps of chicken and cheese, with beans and such on the side.  The flavor was actually pretty good for bar food.  After all that, I wasn't terribly hungry, but I decided to try the shrimp ceviche tostadas, just to have something more nutritious than chips and cheese.  Again, the portion was huge, and the flavor was decent, but the texture was just soft enough to make me wonder if the shrimp was sufficiently pickled.  But enough about the food, this place is a brewery.  I had the peach ale first, and it was good, but waaaay fruity.  I know, I'm the one who ordered a fruity beer, but most of the others I've had just hint of fruit.  This one tasted like peach syrup had been added.  I followed that with the Kilt Lifter.  That was a good beer - plenty of flavor without any bitterness in the aftertaste.  I also got a taste of the special Kilt Lifter that was aged in a bourbon cask, and that was some darn good beer.  I'd definitely go back when back in Phoenix, though maybe just for the beer, not the food.  After all, the bar area was picking up as the "older" patrons were headed home to bed.

Thanks for my friend and ex-Phoenician, Leeanna, for recommending the salad here.  I was headed to some other place that I'd found on Yelp, but was having trouble finding it, when there was Oregano's!  Having had In-N-Out burger for lunch and wanting something light, I remembered Leeanna's statement that she never even tried the pizza here since the salad was that amazing.  So I pulled in to the packed parking lot, past the crowd of folks waiting for a table, and headed for the take out counter.  I opted for the Junior versions of the signature salad and the veggie wedgie.   I sat by the door, since even the bar was full, but didn't wait more than 10 minutes.  The salad was yummy and HUGE, even though I only got the Jr.  I don't particularly care for raisins, so I guess I should have asked to get one without, but it was still delicious.  As with the salad, the veggie wedgie Jr was still HUGE.  I hadn't realized when I ordered it that it came with waffle fries.  Everything had gotten a little spongy and soggy in transport, but that's my fault.  The flavor was still delicious - great combination of eggplant, spinach, tomato, cheese.  I'll definitely come back for more next time I'm in Phoenix.

Disclaimer: This review is only for lunch at the club house.  My primary colleagues in Phoenix love to come to the club house for lunch, particularly since it's just a short drive from their office off of University.  I've been here a dozen or so times in the last 2 years.    We've always been promptly seated, even yesterday, when we needed a table for 9 and all of them were seemingly taken or reserved.  The service is just as friendly once you're seated.  Their menu has some great variety - salads, sandwiches, and southwestern flavored entrees.  My favorites are the flat iron steak salad (steak, avocado, sprouts, and potatoes over greens) and the vegetarian tamale.  The guys that I eat with rave about the tuna salad.  One bummer is that the lemonade isn't fresh (it's powdered).  You can't really taste it in the AP's, but you can when you're drinking straight lemonade.  The view from the patio is nice, even for a non-golfer like myself, so if they offer to seat you out there, I recommend it.  #Yelp365 - 168/365

Birthday dinner with a party of 10 meant that we got to sit right in the middle of the restaurant, since we were too many for the octagon fish bowl room that's right by the hostess stand.   Some of our party was straggling, so we sat and ordered our drinks.  I'd been warned that the margaritas were pricey, so I opted for the orange-raspberry sangria, since I was only drinking with dinner and then being the DD for the bar crawl afterwards.  What a disappointment.  Not only did it not taste like orange or raspberry (more like mango?) but it also didn't take anything like wine or anything alcoholic for that matter, and not in a "wow that goes down so easy because I can't taste the alcohol" kind of way.   I tried my friend's red sangria, and it was worse - it tasted off, not just bad, but as if the wine in it had gone bad.  Once the stragglers arrived, pitchers of margaritas were ordered, and I got to try one - all sour mix.  Did that thing even have tequila in it?  Seriously, for those prices, I would expect a buzz, and I did not get it.    Fortunately the tableside guacamole was delicious.  Not sure why they can charge more at these places for you to see them make it in front of you - except that does prove that they're starting with fresh avocados, which I imagine is the main source of the expense.  They got it right - good balance of salt, jalapenos, tomatoes, and onions.  Not as good as mine, but best I've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The cheese dip was not as good  - too chunky for my taste, as if all the cheese hadn't melted thoroughly enough or properly (like when you try to melt low fat cheese).  The salsas had great flavor, as did the chips, which were already salted (good for me, but bad for your blood pressure).  Trying to be good, I opted for the veggie enchiladas.  Though not what I expected based on the description, they were good, and I don't even like corn, which is mostly what they tasted like to me.  There was zucchini was diced to be about the size of the corn, so really all I tasted was the corn and the sauces on top.   Both the green and the red were delicious.  The rice was blah, but the beans were quite nice.    The server did an excellent job of separating out our checks, and didn't even include the usual automatic 18% gratuity, but you could tell that we weren't her favorite table.  She kept coming back every few minutes at the beginning asking if we were ready to order when our full party hadn't arrived, even when we told her that we'd wait for them.  And the other staff was aggressively removing stuff from the table, as soon as you put your fork down or you started getting air from the bottom of your beverage.  Also, in the process of clearing the chips and salsa, the server spilled almost an entire dish on John's sleeve, and didn't even flinch!  The whole thing made the dinner feel frantic, not enjoyable.  All in all, I would say go if you're craving some good guacamole and a Mexican beer, but eat before or after at somewhere where you get more value.

After a long week of only mildly successful work south of the border, I was ready for something easy and comforting, and my Phoenician friend brought me here.  I was immediately tempted by the "buy the bottle retail and we don't charge you a corkage fee" and opted for the MollyDooker Boxer, which I don't see that often, but is quite tasty.  Also helps that they can recork and let you take it with you so that you can optimize your cost and your wine experience by choosing the best by the bottle.  For the meal, we split the apple manchego salad and the avocado pizza with prosciutto.  The salad was fresh and tasty and had the right ratio of spinach to toppings, though was a little heavy on the dressing.  The pizza crust was very crisp (in a good way) which was the perfect offset to the smooth texture of the avocado.  Kate said that she was worried that the whole thing would be mushy in the mouth with the avocado but that she was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked with the crispy crust.  For dessert, we of course opted for the gelato.  The feature flavor was lavender-pomegranate-rosewater, and was a heavenly aromatic concoction.  We only got singles, and I don't think I could have handled more than that because it was quite flavorful.    Sure, the parking is limited, but the valet next door is free as long as you validate.  Hope that I get some more trips to Phoenix in the future so that we can go back and try some of the stuff from the cute grocery!

I'm really glad that our Charlotte friends live in NoDa so that we can just walk up the street to all the neighborhood bars.  We've been to Solstice a couple of times now, and it's always been nice enough to enjoy the porch, so I'm not sure what the inside really feels like.  I love the back porch/patio area.  We were able to sit and enjoy the twinkle lights while the others played Cornhole.  There seems to be a good selection of beer, being that they have High Life and Magic Hat No. 9, which is enough to keep me happy, though I wish the High Life was on draft.  Also, their bathroom is decent.  Always a plus for a girl who's stopping at all the bars in the neighborhood.

We visited here with friends who have the annual pass to take advantage of all the cool recreational activities available.  We came for the live music on a Saturday night.  The parking lot, which isn't paved, was pretty full, even at 7.  They checked our bags and our chairs to make sure we didn't have any contraband.  After finding a spot by the course closest to the building, we got in line for the food and drink.  They've got a plethora of craft beers to choose from, with almost all of them being local.  They've also got a few food choices - (cheese)burgers, hot dogs, fish tacos.  We got cheeseburgers for $7 each.  They're simple: burger, cheese, bun, with ketchup and mustard available.  They took a while to serve us since they were quite busy.  The burger was decent - a little dry.   We honestly couldn't hear too much of the music, but we were mostly there to socialize, so we didn't mind.  Having glimpsed the rest of the facility, I'm eager to return and check out all that they've got.  If I enjoyed it this much just in spectating and passing, I'm sure I'll think it's awesome when actually doing the activities.

Tired of the good ol' boy type places that the vendors keep picking, I used the Yelp! for Blackberry app to find this place just around the corner from where I was working today.  We had to wait a few minutes for a table to open up, but as soon as one did, I reached for the Spicy Tuna (not that spicy).  I also grabbed the cucumber salad (more sweet than tang, reminding me of my grandmothers bread and butter pickles), the seaweed salad, the rainbow roll (decent fish, but the avocado was dried out), the maguro (far more pink than red...), the salmon (a little on the slimy side, but it didn't smell or taste funny, just weird texture), and tried, at the behest of my less sushi experienced colleagues, the baked scallops on top of a california roll (just plain weird - the top was a combination of crab and baked scallops with some cream sauce, which I'm still tasting now, 4 hours later...).    This was the first conveyor belt sushi place that I've been to in the US, but I knew that just like all sushi in the US, it wouldn't be as good as what I'd had in Japan.  Even considering, I don't think I'll be recommending this place to the rest of the team in the future.  This is a good place to introduce people to sushi, and it's cheap, and fast (once you have a table), but if you've been to Japan and had the real thing, this Americanized version just won't cut it.

For those of you who have yet to experience it, let me just say that there is something so comforting about seeing a "People Love Us on Yelp" sticker in the window of a popular restaurant in another country when you've been wondering around without access to the app and are almost too tired and hungry to care where you actually eat.  With that said, thank you Edinburgh Yelpers for this treasure.  After a full day of walking and touristing after a full week of pub grub, we were ready for something different.  I'd tried to find an Indian place recommended by the guide book from memory, and failed.  So we headed back towards our guest house, remembering several busy Indian places on Leith Walk.    Shezan drew us in with the bright and modern decor, self-described in the menu as "Bollywood."  We were seated immediately, and eagerly perused the menu trying to figure out which dishes were the cause of all the tantalizing smells from those around us.  We decided on samosas, chicken tikka masala, chicken karahi, a side of saag, rice, and naan.  The samosas (3, with a selection of 3 sauces) were crispy on the outside with fluffy and flavorful fillings.  The mains were amazing, particularly the karahi.  The karahi had so much flavor but without filling heavy.  It was plenty spicy in a way that had just enough heat to wake you up, but not so much to cover the other flavors or make you reach for something to cool off your tongue.  The naan was huge - the size of my head.  Perhaps I'm just accustomed to other restaurants that cut it into peices rather than presenting it in on big piece, but I've never seen naan this large.  It was crispy on the bottom and fluffy on top, delicious.  The food definitely deserves 5 stars.  The service, not so much.  It started off well, but even when we'd cleaned our plates (and yes, there were no morsels, not even of sauce left), and there was nothing left in our glasses, it took several minutes to get the attention of any staff to ask for the check.  It's probably us not being accustomed to the European way of lingering at a table all night, but still felt like we'd been forgotten.  That aside, I'd still highly recommend it.

We wanted to see wild and scenic Scotland, without having to do the driving and navigation ourselves, and without feeling rushed.  So we joined the 3 day Isle of Skye tour, leaving on a Monday at 9am and returning on Wednesday around 6pm.  The mini-buses were nice, even with ours being completely full (yes, even the fold down seat by the driver). The guides were knowledgeable and decently friendly.  The schedule was pretty flexible and relaxed, with frequent comfort stops for food, shopping, and toilet breaks.  And when we were on the Isle of Skye and the weather wasn't exactly optimal, Stewart even took a vote as to what we wanted - venture out to Neist Point, head to a castle, or tour the Talisker distillery. Our requests for accommodations were met, though I think the price ended up a wee bit higher than the range advertised when we signed up for the tour.  And our B&B did request payment in cash - just fyi.  While I appreciated the less than strenuous days, and I could see how driving a minibus would make you want a nice long break, I wish we'd gotten started before 9am each day, or at least the successive days of the tours.  I highly recommend for a great way to see the country without having to navigate it yourself.

This review is only for the gelato.  Yes, I also had some beer from the pitchers, and I did see the credit card charges (really, for that?!), but I let everyone else at the table make those decisions (including picking the $$ beer), so I can't be held accountable for remembering what they decided on.  Gelato! Gelato!  We'd started drinking down the street at Dolce Vita, and I'd gotten that salty, bloated beer taste in my mouth.  And I was in the mood for something sweet, but not sugary cocktails.  So I was overjoyed to see the glowing gelato cases as we walked in the front door!  I opted for the cappuccino and hazelnut.  Flavor was amazing and texture was almost as good as what I'd had in Italy.    I was entertained by the girl who was disappointed that they didn't have Nutella and didn't seem to appreciate my suggestion of getting chocolate and hazelnut.  Seriously, your tongue will notice the difference in texture more than the difference between that and actual Nutella gelato.

Met some friends for lunch when headed from Atlanta to Raleigh for the weekend.  They live in NoDa and picked out the place.    It's cozy spot with dark wood, specials on the chalk board, an interesting beverage list, and a small but varied menu.  I opted for the crepe special, with broccolini.  The crepe was yummy - filling but not overly so.  It was a nice break from the usual salads and sandwiches that I eat for lunch.  Anyway, there are 2 reasons this place gets the extra star that says I'm a fan - service and soundtrack.  The people were really friendly, gave good suggestions, and very patient with us.  As for the soundtrack, I don't remember the individual songs, but I remember them all being ones that I love and that fall into that category of upbeat in a relaxing way.  All in all, definitely a great lunch spot.

This is now my favorite hotel for my trips to Phoenix.  Every time that I've checked in, I've been offered 2 bottles of water.  Not sure if this is due to my corporate rate, which also includes breakfast.  It could also be my Hilton Honors membership.  Check in has always been fast and easy, even at 12:45am, when the security guard had to let me through the interior set of glass doors.  Rooms are nicely lit and freshly decorated.  White linens let you know how clean they are.  The showers have glass doors, which isn't my favorite, but again, it lets you know how clean they are.  The provided toiletries are Neutrogena brand.  The rooms all have a mini-fridge, coffee maker, and small microwave.  The TV has 50+ channels, including HBO.  The rooms have wireless and wired connections.  I consider that a plus because wireless is often unreliable in hotels of this size, with signal strength varying greatly between rooms.  Plenty of good amenities: The fitness center has several tread mills and stationary bikes as well as some free weights and some weighted balls.   There's a pool and hot tub out front. The business center has a couple of computers and a fax/scanner/printer. There's a pantry with microwavable items and ice cream.  The breakfast is extensive - eggs any way that you'd like, french toast, waffles, fruit, etc.  As previously mentioned, there's a free shuttle to the airport. It runs every half hour, I believe, at least during peak times.  #Yelp365 - 167/365

At the recommendation of you lovely Edinburgh Yelpers, we had the cab drop us here after our 3 days in the Highlands to get some great views of the city without having to haul my pregnant self up Arthur's Seat.  We were not disappointed.  Arriving in the gloaming, we enjoyed lovely views of the surrounding areas and enjoyed the people watching as dozens gathered to relax on the several monuments and vistas and watch the sun set on the beautiful city and the Firth of Forth.  There are several signs giving information about the monuments as well as the geography of the area, so it's educational as well as beautiful.  Worth the exercise!

My first spring training game was a good experience, thanks to the friendly folks and nice set up at the Salt River Fields at Talking Stick.  Parking was easy and plentiful.  I walked up aisle Q, reading about the Diamondbacks and I gradually approached the third base line.  The friend I was meeting was at the home plate gate - no problem, there's an aisle on the back side of the concessions that makes it easy to get there.  When you build something new where the land is plentiful, you can design it to be easy to get around.  I was most impressed by the sunscreen dispensers in the outfield lawn area, which seemed to be doling out Coppertone Sport SPF 30 (which happens to be my favorite because it glides on easy and stays put).  We wandered around the whole park to check out the different foods available, but decided on the classic dogs and beers by homeplate.  I got the Arizona Dog - bison with green chiles and onions.    With concessions in hand, we walked down to the 3rd based line to talk to the Diamondback players as they slowly made their way towards the dugout shaking hands, signing balls, taking photos.  Once the game started, we sat in our comfy seats with a great view of the field.  After a few innings, we headed over to the Rockies bullpen.    There are great views from all over this park.  I love that everything is open so that you can really see what's going on both on and off the field.  There's also a good mix of shade and sun.  I hope work brings me to the area again next year!
