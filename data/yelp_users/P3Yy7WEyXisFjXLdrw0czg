I will never go here again.  The blond had nothing but attitude with me over the way I wanted "my salad" and she gave me dirty looks when I was telling her what I wanted in it and how I wanted it made.  I like everything mix together not just piled on top. ..

I had great customer service here. I called and got a free oil change and when I got there they were all nice and great conversation with them. I got a quote with some things I wanted to add to my truck. And they were lower in price then another place I went to by $400.00 I will be going there to add some things to my truck. Thanks

I would love to think Christina in the bakery department for saving my day. I tried to bake a cake for my boyfriends son and the cake just came out horribly wrong when I was decorating it. I called her up and she said right away she's got a cake for me she is awesome and a lifesaver and I think her very much... The cake is exactly what I was trying to do.

I went into this subway three times too many. everytime I go in there and I like a specific way my salad is made. These employees roll their eyes and have giving me attitude. I normally go to the subway at 19th Avenue and Thunderbird I'm going to continue to go back there no matter how out of the way that subway is. I get better service there. this subway has nothing but a bunch of children working at it. Their friends walk in they stop your order to chat. very unprofessional. The employees here roll their eyes every time you ask him to do something different. and then get a huge attitude about it. Isn't subway a place where you get your salad and your sandwich is made fresh the way you order it? I thought it was. I will never go back to the subway again. I would advise anyone else from going to the subway.

This was the worse service I have ever gotten from any safeway. Normally I have fantastic  service. But not here. I wanted a sandwich so I was standing at the deli and no one was there but one employee who clearly did not work the deli area. This lady walks out and started talking to the guy about some other employees problems. First off I didn't need to hear about it but I guess I did. Zoyie, (or how ever you spell her name) took her sweet time talking and making his sandwich... I stood there thinking of just grabbing some sushi and leaving, but I wanted a sandwich. I was standing there 7 minutes. Yes I was looking at the clock. Then this other lady Alizabeth walks over says can I help next person. I said yes, and that chick blew me off smiled at someone else and started talking to them. Then after about 10 minutes standing there Zoyie says can I help next person. I said again "YES!!! I was next in line." Told her what I wanted. Took forever to make my sandwich. Then I told her I wanted artichoke hearts also please. Her comment was "ooh you do know they are extra," and she said it with an attitude. I said "I know they are extra. It is not a normal item for a sandwich." I should have just grab some sushi and left. I will never go back to this safeway again for anything. AJ is a mile away and I don't care about that extra dollar I will spend on a sandwich. I know I will get better customer service there.

Nina use to be at a different  salon. And now she is here. I would recommend  going to her for all your nail needs and waxing. She is the best. I am a dog groomer and my hands are always in water and my nails never lift. I have even gone a month without getting my nails done and still no lifting..
