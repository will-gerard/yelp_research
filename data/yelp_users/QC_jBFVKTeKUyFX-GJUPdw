Just finished eating here with my family. The food was absolutely awful! All the meat was dry everything was very greasy. The lo mein was orange and tasted like chemicals of some sort!! Definitely will not be going back EVER.  Also very expensive $70+ 4 adults and 2 kids

If you want a car buying experience without the pushy sales guy this is the place!  I loved the laid back atmosphere.  I found the car I wanted and despite my poor credit Tim made sure that I left in that car with a manageable payment! I love my honda accord from The other guys automotive! I'm taking my mom here to find a car and would recommend them to anyone!
