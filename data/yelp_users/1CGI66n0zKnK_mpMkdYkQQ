So, ignore that feeling that you are going the wrong place and/or walking into an abandoned warehouse to certain death...This place is fantastic for all your pet supply needs. They have a $25 minimum so be prepared to wander the shelves of the warehouse, picking up collars, pet toys and much more. The prices are ridiculously low in comparison to other pet places and the front desk people were pleasant at check-out (after locking my bag in a dog kennel during my warehouse perusal). They are only open during the week till 4:30pm so plan accordingly.

Let me count the ways I love this place...Three different restaurants, succulent sales, beautiful scenery, shops, farmer's market....The Farm at South Mountain is officially one of my favorite places ever...In the world.   Great breakfast. Excellent lunch. I cannot wait to try dinner here.   Oh, the bacon, chicken, apple, date, tomato sandwich and the delicious cherry, white chocolate bread pudding, I adore thee. If going on a weekend, make sure you give yourself a lot of time. Take some time to wander, enjoy the grounds and the rock wall. Then go have another slice of the bread pudding, 'cause it's worth it.

I have fairly simple nail needs so I tend to just wanting a relaxing pedicure occasionally in a nice, clean locale. I really like Bamboo Nails and I've always had a good experience here, including the time the two techs working with me had a long conversation on politics, education systems, classical music and karaoke, so hey! I especially like the pedicures here with the salt scrub and paraffin wax treatments.

Tasty toasted sandwiches with a little side of weird and a whole lot of pot references. But, back to the sandwiches...The signature garlic herb bread is fantastic and they have a ton of options. Plus, the staff is super nice/laid back (I'm sure everyone is shocked by this) and will make some pretty great suggestions. My last sandwich here was the pinner KGB, a roast beef sandwich with mushrooms, bell peppers, and Swiss with extra horseradish sauce plus the works (lettuce, tomato, onions, oil, vinegar, Parmesan cheese and oregano). Added some Pineapple Yerba Matte iced tea and I was super happy. I wouldn't bring your conservative mother-in-law to this place due the the giant blunt sculpture hovering in the back, but anyone else who loves a good sandwich will adore this place.

Operative words for this place are cheap and tasty. Get anything with carne asada. It is actually in a shack, so don't expect too much ambiance other than large wooden tables full of construction workers and college students from down the road. I would suggest calling your order in ahead as the line at lunch can get long.

Came here for the partner's birthday and we had a really wonderful evening. The staff was really nice and our waitress was the perfect blend of friendly, funny, and attentive. We both had lobster and filet mignon, split the steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes, and then ended the meal with a chocolate souffle and creme brulee. (So, really, as stereotypical as you can possibly get with a steakhouse dinner.)   The steak and lobster were prepared very expertly. the broccoli was only so-so, and the souffle was definitely undercooked and a bit gooey. I REALLY wished they had bruleed the brulee before it was sent out so it had been freshly put together, but it was good none the less. All in all, it was still a very classic steakhouse, and we had a great evening.

For a hand wash place, I at least expect them to wash off the wax on my window they wrote on themselves. After waiting for ten minutes in an empty lobby trying to pay and then receiving my barely wiped down car, I will not be coming back.

Chatty baristas, tasty coffee, mismatched furniture without any pretense, board games, live jazz, uber (the biggest drink size) upgrades on Wednesdays, a motley selection of snacks, free wifi, and hodgepodge of college students, grandmas, locals, bikers, hipsters and more, Gold Bar reminds me of my very first coffee house back in the day. when I first discovered the glories of caffeine and people watching. This small little joint  is not a swanky place, but it is like a bit of home, albeit home with chai tea, almond joy coffee, and espresso.

Super friendly and nice service with lots of healthy (-ish, let's be honest we ordered the Monte Cristo French Toast) breakfast and lunch options. We split the Market Hash (yum!), the Monte Cristo French Toast (perfect balance of salty and sweet), and I got a Kale Tonic (which my love took a hard pass on and I quite enjoyed). Wish it was closer to where we live as we would come here all the time!

I'm snobby about sushi after growing up in LA and living in SF. Sushi Kee is delicious and I will totally drive myself to its strip mall destination in Mesa whenever I want a fix. Everything generally comes with a standard salad and miso soup (which are fine), but the star really is the sushi. Sashimi is no joke and there are tons of rolls from which to choose. We got a bizarre array of nude rolls, dragon rolls, unagi...so good and fresh. This place reminds me of the low key and awesome sushi restaurant I grew up next to in LA. Plus, everything goes on Happy Hour special prior to 6:30pm!

Garishly pink, old school ice cream parlor with adjacent arcade in the heart of old town Scottsdale. I adore thee, Sugar Bowl, even if ice cream and I do not get along particularly well. Pass on the food (there are numerous better places for dinner nearby), but definitely stop here for a sundae or a scoop. (And, maybe some arcade games...Ahem.) The last time I was there, the place was full of hipsters, families, prom dates getting ice cream, older couples, pretty much everyone. It's pretty great.

My very, very soon to be husband and I worked with Joe and Beth on a custom engagement ring. And, I could not possibly love it more! I get constant compliments (like two a day everyday) on the design, graceful diamond halo (of 42 diamonds...which makes me irrationally happy to have the meaning of life number in diamond halo form), and the clarity and sparkle of the center stone.   We ended up going to Schubach as a center diamond was not particularly important to us both, we wanted to look at several different options from natural diamonds to lab grown to various moissanites to Amora gems, and we also knew we wanted a custom design. Overall, our experience here was fantastic - we went in to look at ring samples, described how we wanted a combination of two samples rings. Next, we got the CAD mock-ups super quickly and then several slight revisions. The ring was then completed after confirming the final design. It was a tad big on the finger when we went to pick it up and was resized promptly.   The work is spectacular and I adore my ring, nicknamed Liberace as it's, well, a bit larger than life and fabulous. I could not recommend Schubach more and would love to have several family pieces reset by them in the future.

Great, simple food prepared amazingly well with easy service and a casual yet upscale atmosphere - I really, really like this place. My mom was visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to head to dinner in Oldtown Scottsdale. After nixing The Mission due to deafening noise level, we headed to Bandera where we had a fabulous dinner. Started with the deviled eggs (they were okay - I am not a fan of surprise celery in anything-  but needed a little more spice.) Skip these and get the skillet cornbread! I had the filet mignon with seasonal veg (broccoli) and mashed potatoes and the mom had the Loup de Mer (seabass) with marcona almonds and herbs plus veggies. The fish and steak were both perfectly cooked. We also got a couple very well balanced cocktails and the nice, unobtrusive waitress brought out additional chilled martini glasses to keep our drinks cold during dinner. I am looking forward to going back as the view of the open concept kitchen has convinced me I have to try a lot more of their menu!

Yes!!!! This place so reminds me of the by the slice pizza places in NYC and Boston that I used to frequent with (ahem, possibly too much) regularity. We wandered in after grabbing coffee at Cartel next door, and I am totally sold on their slices with toppings. The crust is thin, tasty, and with just the right amount of bite. Can't wait to try more items as they all looked great. Love the cute, very clean, and homey feel of the entire place.

Great hummus and tasty plate options for lunch in a little grocery store stuffed full of spices, snacks, and sweets. In terms of lunch places, I wish I was a bit closer as I would come here all the time! Food is fresh, well-seasoned, and just plain good. The baklava options at the counter are great, too!

After living in Boston for a long time, the land of the worst Mexican food ever, I yearn...YEARN...for good Mexican food on a consistent basis now that I'm back in the Southwest. Serranos, though not the ultimate foodie experience as it tends very traditional, is delicious. Free bean dip, chips and salsa are an easy way to my heart, but followed by enchiladas or a burrito fundido style with a house margarita...Yes, please! I've always had really great service at this location even when they were swamped. Plus...there's always the bean dip to tide you over till you order.

Should you be sensitive to loud noises, fear crowded spaces, or cringe at a sea of be-speckled people sitting in front of macs, Lux may not be the place for you. However, if you enjoy a busy slice of downtown Phoenix, delicious espresso, tattoo watching, eating pastries outside, and freshly prepared breakfast, I would suggest you try this place out. The traffic flow of this place drives me insane, but then I have some coffee, maybe a cookie, and calm down to watch the word move by likely to a DJ-spun beat.

Went to inquire about a dinner for around 20 to 25 people. Was blatantly told they don't do that in possibly the rudest way ever by the not-busy in the slightest manager. Not only will there be no dinner here, I will also be making a request that all 120 people traveling to Scottsdale from Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and out of country do not eat here while they are in town as they will likely just be met with brusque attitude and the worst customer service possible.

The Cornish Pasty Company is fantastic. I've had many, many of their numerous options and my particular favorites have been the Lamb and Mint, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala (which was quite spicy!), the Lamb Vindaloo, and the Rosemary Chicken. The Peanut Butter and Jelly dessert pasty is pretty tasty, but it simply does not compare to the Sticky Toffee Pudding (best with the ice cream option). Sides are also really good - I really like the Oven Chips and the Broccoli and Cauliflower Bake.

I've had my tiny monster mutt for just a few months, and after sampling a bunch of different dog parks, this is by far the best one. There are two sides, one for active (ahem, larger dogs) and passive (generally the smaller dogs) dogs. Both have large grassy areas, water and plenty of places to perch (though, er, keep those legs away from the side of the concrete blocks...many things have been sprayed upon those surfaces).  Besides the two sides, the owners here seem really responsible, keeping careful watch on their dogs and making sure there aren't any signs of aggression. I'd suggest making sure you bring your own water as the fountains are a bit underwhelming. Just be prepared for attracting a large pack of water-seeking canines during the hot months.

Had a wonderful facial from CeeCee and my skin looks amazing! It was relaxing with a great massage.

If I lived closer, I would go here all the time!

Delicious! Your waistline will not thank you for coming here, but every other part of you will be ecstatic about the glorious, fattening fair. Pancakes are fluffy, the hash browns crispy, the sausages delicious, etc. I vote you go full force and get the Wildberry Bliss pancakes or French Toast, either stuffed with blueberries, layered with mascarpone cream (I would eat this on cardboard) and berry glaze with a side of berries. Go early on the weekends as it can be a wait.

Cheap. Tasty. Good carne asada. Hot red and green sauce upon request. I love their rolled tacos with guacamole, smothering in before mentioned hot sauce plus a horchata. Extremely ugly interior with a lonely claw machine in the corner plus an always amusing clientele set.

Supposedly known for their wings, Native New Yorker needs to perhaps find a new wheelhouse, specialty or business concept as their signature offerings are...meh at best. This location in particular is like a bizarre vortex of awful, truly weird layout, odd glass rooms full of overall wearing men, and dated fixtures straight from 1999. After being offered "half price strippers," you will then likely wait an inordinately long time whilst perched on a sticky booth. It's certainly an experience with lots of sauce options...which does not make up for the overall lacking of everything else in any way.

I love dive bars. I love live music. I like local joints with character...yet I have been here numerous times even with regulars and I still am not quite comfortable at this bar. Live music most nights on either side of the bar. Lots of hoodied dudes with beards and vapes on one side with the other side populated by a diverse group of people united in their joint efforts to relive the 90s. Sound is loud, but unclear and muffled for concerts. Bonus points for hard cider options, but massive negative points for somewhat iffy parking lot encounters on the way to and fro. So, Tempe adventures through the safari of the parking lot + rousing coverband renditions of the greatest 90s pseudo-punk hits + good beer selection on the newer side = Yucca Tap Room.

Cult Classics shows get five stars from me. As a discount movie theater, this place is nifty. Movies are $2-$3 depending on the day for slightly on-the-cusp of DVD release flicks. I like the funky vibe, wacky displays and kind of grass-roots feel though the Raggmuffins of Rock are...uh, interesting/the thing of nightmares. The seats and projections are outdated and a bit mediocre, but really, who is going to complain when you can go see a film for $2 and the snack selection is also discounted accordingly?

I've lived in some very coffee-centric places in the world (SF, LA, Boston, overseas) and this is a good place to grab some espresso in Scottsdale. The baristas are super friendly and funny, a nice change from the exceedingly pretentious coffee-slingers of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Decor is a nice blend of retro and modern, music can be a bit deafening.

Amazing. Delicious. Fantastic. Gorgeous. This place is the best.   Went for my birthday dinner with the family in the spring, and everything on the menu was glorious. The setting is romantic and chic. The service was impeccable. The cocktails from the bar were fantastic. And, the food....SO GOOD. The menu changes every week based on local availability and freshness. I ended up with prawns and lemon ricotta cheese fried in a squash blossom, lump crab and burrata salad, perfectly cooked filet mignon with delicious mashed potatoes, and a tiny butter rum cake for dessert. This cafe quickly went on our list for revisit as soon as possible.

Love this market! The produce from both Blue Sky (love their kale, lettuce, spring onions) and McClendons (peppers, carrots, squash, etc.) is really great. This market tends more toward food products than produce, but it's always a good time. Stop for a coffee by the gates on the eastern side, sample all the different chocolates and sauces, buy some bread (great gluten-free options abound), and then hit up the produce sections. Get there early though as it gets crowded (and hot) after 10am.

I feel like I experienced an entirely different place than the majority of these reviews.   The noodles in the bun were overcooked to the point of being  completely mushy and the dipping sauce was highly questionable. The rice paper wrappers on the gi cun were super rubbery and yet squishy at the same time.The Pho was okay...Nothing to write home about.  I absolutely love Vietnamese food, but I will not come back here.

I admit I was more than slightly terrified to try sushi in Maricopa given the town's ability to produce at best mediocre food. BUT, Say Sushi was good, the service was super friendly, and they have happy hour every day plus $1 appetizers when you order a sake bomb. I'm totally sold for happy hour and look forward to trying the more Korean options like bibimbap on the menu in future visits.

Convenient to ASU, friendly service, simple warm ambiance, and pretty decent Thai food. I've had AMAZING spicy Pad Thai here and then the next time it was only so-so, so the consistency is a bit hard to predict. I really like that they offer different levels of spiciness for their menu options (personally, medium doesn't seem spicy at all to me). I enjoy the fried tofu with sweet and spicy sauce, the papaya salad (order it spicy!), the Pad Prik King (green beans, carrots and lemon leaves stir-fried with your protein of choice), and either the Pad Thai or the Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles). Service has always been extremely nice and prompt.

I've been here a bunch and the food is always delicious. It's a bit on the pricey side for veggie fare, but I just tell myself I'm back in Los Angeles and get to enjoying my iced Pom milk latte with my $14 breakfast bowl. The coffee is really great, especially when it includes their house blended non-dairy milk. I tend to like the breakfast options more than lunch, the Pom Muffin, bowls, and scrambles always well cooked and tasty. For lunch, the nachos....are not good so avoid those, and get one of the salads, bowls, or sandwiches instead. Service can be a tad spastic, and you do have the sense that the regulars get way better service post-yoga class than any newbies in town. They have a lovely pastry/dessert case up front, too, so grab a gluten free power bar, a cup of coffee, and get prepared to eavesdrop on people extolling the virtues of hot yoga and wheat grass.

This place was hoppin' on a Wednesday night! After perusing the weird items at the adjacent Tuesday Morning as we were waiting for a table, we eventually got a seat on the patio, some of the only people to brave the chilly 70 degree evening in Arizona. We got calamari, the capellini pescatore, and the baked rigatoni. All the main dishes come with their antipasti salad and ciabatta bread. Now, my home town is largely Sicilian and I lived in Italy for a bit. Rigatony's is super solid, homey Italian American food. It's like what Macaroni Grill should be with a bit more soul and liberal use of garlic. The marinara sauce for dipping or on the pasta has a nice kick of fresh garlic, the ciabatta was delicious, and I hoovered down my rigatoni with ultimate ease. My partner in dining/life and I both agreed this would go in our rotation for easy comfort food. We're fans.

The ol' partner and I are getting married. And, we do not like cake....Enter, looking for delicious pie for a large nuptial shindig. We contacted Traci at Pie Snob to arrange a tasting, and went forth to sample four different pies, Blueberry Lime, Caramel Apple Pecan, Green Chili Apple, and Banana Cream. The crust was perfect, flaky, savory, just the right texture and doneness. All the fillings were amazing, our standout favorite the two types of apple pies. The Green Chili Apple Pie is AMAZING (especially warmed up later with some vanilla ice cream), but the Caramel Apple Pecan pie was the overall crowdpleaser. Seriously, this is some delicious pie! We will definitely be ordering a whole bunch of wedding pie from Pie Snob!

Best karaoke in the valley by far, cheap drinks, non-pretentious dive atmosphere, and surprisingly good bar food (well, for the most part - skip the salads). Service can be a bit spastic sometimes, but is generally well humored and nice. They do karaoke every night at 9pm, earlier in the week for those evenings when you just want to sing and try out new stuff. Friday and Saturday karaoke gets down to business though so if you want to sing, get there early.

We hosted our wedding reception at the Clayton this May and it was simply amazing! Claire and the whole team were wonderful, responsive, and so warm. The setup was flawless and they even allowed us to try a couple of the decor components such as the large ribbon curtains prior to the date to ensure they worked. For the reception, the service was gracious and prompt, the food was fabulous, and there was not a single issue in the whole evening. Our guests have been telling us that it was by far the best food they have ever had at an event, they loved the diverse selections, and everything felt like it had been made with great love and care. As a party space, the Clayton was fantastic - We decided to host the cocktail hour on the first floor, serve dinner upstairs, and return back to the first floor for the reception/dancing/karaoke portion of the evening. Since the venue is so modern and simple, you can really make it work for whatever you want (as we did a gold dinosaur/fiesta colored wedding, we can attest to the flexibility of the space!) Overall, we could not have asked for a better venue, better service, responsiveness, and fun location. Thanks again to Claire and the whole staff!

The Herb Box is by far one of my favorite places for a weekend lunch. It's such an eclectic little jewel inside with fresh and well prepared food. I've sampled a good portion of lunch items, and it's all been good, steak salads, enchiladas, a very odd toast/salad/fried shrimp bonanza of weird.  It's is a very Scottsdale locale so I do somewhat worry that my eyebrows are not waxed enough or my nose straight enough to lounge in the patio by the canal. But, the drinks are good, the service is lovely, and beyond the weird shrimp toast, the food is great!

I've been here many a times for breakfast and it's good. However, today we sat on the patio for about 20 minutes without any of the many, many wait staff even acknowledging our presence. The wiener dog mutt friend was with us, but he was behaving amongst all the other patio dogs. It felt like we were actively being ignored when all we wanted were some eggs. After numerous meals here, this very much soured the experience. So strange.

LUX was amazing from start to finish. We met with them to discuss our very general wants (bright colors, lots of texture, crazy floral elements for our non-traditional wedding), and they got it perfectly in their very prompt and fully broken down quote and mock-up. The flowers that arrived for the wedding were fresh, colorful, and so fun. They also did a wild variety of table settings for us as well as awesome cocktail decor, all the wedding party flowers including many flower crowns, and more. Plus, they also designed a large 8' tall "wishing tree" out of  manzanita branches and an awesome succulent base! Overall, LUX was a wonderful vendor, great with communication, and provided a superior service for a very reasonable price. And, really, the flowers were amazing with such great attention to great design and balance!

At first glance, the breakfast menu is seriously underwhelming. However, having now had the house Eggs Benedict with black truffle hollandaise sauce and chorizo over fresh tomatoes (with actual taste!), this place is going into the delicious breakfast rotation. Service was great (we were the first people there and wary of being alone in such a large restaurant), and the coffee was super tasty. Breakfast burrito, custom omelet and the eggs benedict were all perfectly cooked, the roasted potatoes on the side a serious star of the morning. Love the super modern Latino decor throughout the restaurant and The Saguaro Hotel.

Oh, AZ Burro breakfast burrito, how I adore thee. Then again, everything I've had for breakfast or lunch has been excellent. Love the breakfast bowls and salads... My one and only (incredibly minor and unimportant) gripe is that they are super liberal with the coffee creamer. SO. MUCH. CREAMER. EVERY. TIME. But, that doesn't really matter when you can stuff a delicious turkey, bacon and egg breakfast burrito in your face.

Sweet potato stuffed poblano pepper as a side - Remember these words as they will be important when you order. Good food with both a southwestern and slight bistro flair. Casual dining with somewhat of a bicycle theme. Super peppy waitstaff and a nice outdoor seating area with a couple fire pits. Good beer selection and quite good cocktails. Repeat - get the stuffed poblano pepper!

Long on my list of quick lunch places to try, I finally made it to Hummus Xpress. And, I have hence determined this is an immensely dangerous find as I work nearby and will have to give them all my lunch money in exchange for tasty Mediterranean food.   Similar to the Chipotle-style of choosing your ingredients (and having no one to blame but yourself if the combo is questionable), you first choose between a bowl, salad, pita or plate. Then all the options begins...   Chicken, braised beef, falafel, veggies, or gyro leads to a selection of 7 hot veggies ranging from lemon kale to fried eggplant. Then you made choice on 6 different hummus flavors (cilantro jalapeño actually has a bit of a kick!) Then salad choices (tabouli, kale onion, lentil kale) to finally finish off with an impressive array of toppings. Everything is full of flavor and cooked well, and the staff was efficient and nice.   I'm already plotting my next bowl for my return visit.

So, so good. Great enchiladas (oh god the fresh cheese), amazing burros (get the bistec with red sauce), cactus tacos, giant tortas, and more. Don't let the former Denny 's look from outside throw you off. This place is great. Service is friendly and on top of it plus the chips and salsa are delish.

Eh. If you are under 23, still using your mom's credit card, and haven't traveled anywhere outside of Arizona, this might be the place for you. I am heartily unimpressed as I don't think the hassle or the price range is worth the experience. Fairly self-important door staff (sigh, why? Just why?), overpriced drinks (it is a club though so I give them a pass for that), and some okay music. In the end, I would rather just wait to go out in Los Angeles or Vegas. Make "reservations" if you want to go on a Saturday evening.

Cheap, tasty, fun and super cute inside - What is not to like? Plus, they have happy hour!   We got the Combo Caribe to start  which is fried yuca fries with jalapeno ranch sauce, giant squished green plantain chips, and sweet plantains served with crema for dipping. Yuca fries would have been improved by being a tad smaller and crispier and I wished the jalapeno ranch was spicier, but all in all very good. Sweet plantains were the obvious winner of this trio, and I shall be back to eat many of them.   We then got the chicken and veggie empanadas and the pulled pork (pernil) along with simple cabbage salad, Earl Grey iced tea and watermelon agua fresca. The empanadas were light, crisp and delicious. I really cannot wait to try the more exotic offerings!

I really love this place - Especially for the 1/2 & 1/2 options when I'm feeling particularly indecisive. The salads are wonderful (though a better proportion in topping:lettuce ratio in the half size.)  I really like the Perfect Pear Classic salad, the Wild Chop salad, and my new great love the Pear Blossom salad, pears, almonds, yellow raisins, quinoa, feta, and mint with a poppyseed dressing.  I've tried the Mediterranean Mac & Cheese (roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, arugala, feta and cheesy pesto) as well as as the Creamy Mushroom Marsala pasta (caramelized onions, mushrooms and roasted garlic), but my favorite is the Athena's Garden pasta (zucchini, arugula, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and garlic basil sauce) as the garlic flavor is quite strong and delicious. I really like that gluten free pasta is not extra and you can add a protein, salmon, chicken, sausage, etc., on to most things.   Service here has always been great and very attentive.

Love the bizarre array of buildings, lush garden, and bevy of rescue exotic birds cawing loudly at you as you meander through the beer menu. Perch is tucked away behind the main downtown area and it has such epic promise. Our service was slow and spastic, but nice. The Bird Food, caramel popcorn, fried jalapeños, and bacon lardon was...weird and sticky. But, with the option to order lots of tiny beers to try a ton, some interesting menu items, and an awesome locale, I will so be back many a time.

Happened upon this place on its grand opening and I have been coming back ever since! Really, really adorable and pretty decor inside. Very nice technicians and a great pedicure with hot stone massage (yes, please!). My nails have always looked great and the polish has lasted a long time.

Great coffee, a very nice setting near enough to everything ASU but far enough away to not be crazed, and tasty vegan pastries. I'm a fan.

Tasty smoothies, coffee, and a friendly staff! I love this place and its vibe, modern coffee house with a bit of an industrial/etsy twist. Don't be fooled by the black out windows in front (which makes it look closed and empty) and head on in for a snack or two.
