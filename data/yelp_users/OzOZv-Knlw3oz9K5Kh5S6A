Stayed a total of 2 nights / 2 nights (10-10-08 / 10-12-08) in one of the South Tower rooms. Got to say I had no complaints with the hotel or the staff. Big, clean rooms with a 42 inch plasma TV. Decent sized bathroom, not too big not too small. The staff was friendly and helpful. For the price, it's got to be one of the best hotels in downtown.   I personally dig the classic Vegas feel of downtown, so staying here is fine with me.   Got to say the only complaint I have is that they didn't have any $5 Blackjack or Craps tables. Considering the economy and the fact we are in old-school downtown Vegas, I would think they would bump down the minimums?   Oh, and that "Defending the Caveman" show looks absolutely stupid and lame. I really hope they ditch it by the time I return back to Vegas!

Bobby Flay comes off as arrogant premadonna...his attitude on TV comes through as someone who's got a chip on his shoulder...  Yes, he may be egocentric but I'm giving him this; He has mastered the craft of blending southwestern flavors in ways never seen before!  After deciding to take my old man to Vegas for his 55th birthday, I made reservations at Mesa Grill. Knowing that my father appreciates southwestern spices and flavors, I knew it was going to be an adventure for both of us. 8:15 PM reservations on Friday night (10-10-08) and we were seated immediately. Started with some Black Widow Mojitos and some shots of Patron Silver. The mood of the restaurant was definitely busy and loud (not overly loud...I was able to have a nice conversation with my father). I wouldn't recommend it for a &quot;romantic&quot; dinner between two people. I did love the vibrant southwestern colors that covered M.G.  We ordered up a Smoked Chicken / Black Bean Quesadilla for an appetizer. Cut in four equal slices, these little triangles of taste bud bursting goodness satisfied as well as brought mass excitement to what was coming in the main course. The flavors that popped from the chicken were amazing, very tasty!  My father got the Chipotle Halibut (which he raved about for days after the trip, stating &quot;The best meal I have ever had&quot;). I got the Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye with Green and Red Sauce, which was extremely tender and full of flavors of chills, garlic and grilled aged beef...well worth getting if you are a steak fan (ask for it medium rare!).   After reading some of the reviews pre and post my visit to the Mesa Grill in Las Vegas, I have got to speak from the heart...and from the heart of someone who likes to enjoy a good meal...  - If you can't hang with the high end cost...DON'T GO! I look at a meal like this as experiencing art and taking in everything as an experience as a whole. Food, at this caliber, shouldn't be consumed as a burger from In-N-Out or a Pizza from Round Table. It should be enjoyed bite by bite. Some people just don't understand how someone could drop a C-Note + for a meal...but then again, some people can't and don't understand the arts.   - Small portions aren't necessarily a bad thing, especially if you take it bite by bite and enjoy what you are tasting. Buffets are all good when you are down to get stuffed for a good price. Here, you pay for high quality dishes that will be sure to stuff you if you take your time and enjoy it.   - The dishes I tried definitely brought the heat! Amazing flavors that aren't afraid of leaving some sweat on the brow! (The Black Widow Mojito is really a refreshing beverage when eating some of the more spicier dishes).   - While I heard about the poor service, the staff were on the ball (consider this was on a Friday night from 8:00 - 9: 30 PM). Very friendly and helpful.   2 Black Widow Mojitos 2 Shots Of Patron 1 Smoked Chicken Quesadilla Appetizer 1 Chipotle Halibut Entree 1 Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye  Total W/ Tip : $180.00  Yeah, Bobby Flay has gained some respect from me and I'll be returning to his institution for sure!

Spinners is a must stop when playing Vista Del Camino. Either because you might want to pick up some new plastic or maybe (like me) you want to replace a lost disc in one of the water hazards that come into play on the course. Whatever the case may be, Spinners is a convenient place for us disc golfers who love the sport. It's located in the strip mall located near the tee pad for hole 12...just look for the flag banner with the Spinners logo.   The store is quite small in size, but they pack a ton of products into the space they have. Everything from discs to apparel...baskets and bags...finding what you need shouldn't be a problem here.   I enjoyed talking with Ashley about Arizona disc golfing and about the sport in general. I mentioned to him that a buddy of mine who used to live in Arizona, but now lives in So. Cal suggested I check out Spinners....told him his name and Ashley immediately knew who I was talking about. Small world!!!   They also rent bikes as well for the non-golfer.

I'm going to echo Gabe L's review by saying that the food and atmosphere was good but the service was quite bad...even as there were very few patrons in the restaurant on a Sunday evening.   It's funny, I arrive at my brother's house and he says we're coming here for dinner and I mentioned how I bookmarked this place to try for morning coffee...let's just say I didn't come back for coffee due to my first impression.   We sat ourselves down at a table and waited several minutes to receive a menu. Our waiter was kind of abrasive and not very personable to say the least. We ordered up a few beers and one of their cheese platters, which was really good. I ordered up a Pretzel Roll Roast Beef Sandwich and side salad which was really good as well. We ended our meal with some of their caramel flavored gelato which was super creamy and amazingly light.   According to my brother and his wife, the service is usually much more together and we were visited by the waiter from their last visit...a much more happy and personable guy. Usually I can overlook bad service when the food is good but it seemed like our business wasn't really appreciated on this visit (although the other waiter was super friendly and happy to hear I was from out of town). At least I would have expected some kind of "sorry for the slow service" apology but it never came. When I visit again, i might return to attempt another go at either dinner or at least coffee. But until then, I can't give this place my blessing...even if the food is above par.

Let's see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that's not a surprise (pun intended) considering you're attending a sporting event...even spring training.   But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, you're lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, I'd live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year.   I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean.   Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!).   I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!

CPK who????!!!!  Why, oh why can't this place have locations in southern California??? Stopped here with my brother and his wife after a spring training game over at Surprise Stadium. I was super hungry so I was really interested in what these gourmet pizzas were all about. Mind you I grew up with a father who would make homemade gourmet pizzas that were super, super good (still my favorite pizza...will likely be apart of my last meal if I ever am sent to death row).   Anyway, we walk in on an early Monday evening and the place is pretty empty. We sit down and order up our drinks. I tried one of their organic iced teas...not sure which one I got but it was super good and refreshing. The decor and feel of the place was warm and calming, with a lot of Picasso'eqe art lining the walls.  We started off with one of their natural chopped Italian salad. Being all health conscious, I was suspicious on how good it would taste and boy were my concerns unneeded. Despite having smoked ham and salami, the salad was super light yet extremely flavorful. Loved their Italian dressing as it was also light...they also didn't drown the salad in it, so it was lightly covered with the dressing. All the produce (Lettuce and Tomatoes) were organic and the croutons were gluten free...a really nice way to start the meal.   We decided upon trying the Chipole and Chicken pizza with the Bagel crust (I think that's what it was). Whatever the case, it was GOOD! And the thing to put it over the OK mark was the Bagel Crust!!! All the toppings were super fresh.   We ended the meal with one of their baked apples and vanilla ice cream. Another tasty, yet light creation. Walking out, we noticed that we must have arrived just in time because the place had filled up all around us, including outside where the weather was beautiful. The service was really friendly and attentive as well.   Good thing I have family in AZ because I think I must come back to try some more of their health wise meals.

One of the things I noticed about Avondale Arizona is the abundance of chain restaurant establishments, especially north of I-10 off of Dysart Road. But if you venture on the south side of the 10, you will come across TJ's.   TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is about as un-chain as you will find in these parts. A true mom-and-pop diner that serves up meals that scream comfort. My experience here came on the morning I made my way back to California after nearly a week on the road in Arizona visiting family. I can thank my brother and sister-in-law for taking me here on this morning visit.   Arrived to a near empty restaurant and sat down and ordered up their Ham and Mushroom omelet which came with four golden pancakes. The omelet was simple and fresh and the pancakes were fluffy and reminded me of my grandmother's pancakes (just a little beyond golden brown...but not burnt). The Hot Chocolate was out of this world good...super chocolatey and smooth with the dollop of whipped cream on top.     The service is friendly but real cut and dry about things...like "tell me what you want and make it fast". I kind of like that about this place as it's a real locals spot (witnessed locals talking about family and life with the waitress and each other). I also found it amusing that the cook came out and observed our order being taken...I guess he wants to make sure there's no mistake or screw ups in between us and him.   Avondale is lucky to have a place like this...seriously...with a town full of chain restaurants, TJ's gives Avondale some much needed character when it comes to dining options.

This was my last coffee house experience on my southwest road trip and unfortunately it ended on a sour note with Blue Sky Java.   Honestly, I hate giving bad reviews due to a few small details but in my opinion these are some important small details that were missed on my visit.   First of all, when I pulled up...two girls were sitting outside and one of them happened to be the only working barista. Granted things might have been slow since it was later in the morning after the rush of morning commuters, but it kind of shows bad work ethic when potential customers are pulling up and the working staff are hanging out in front (especially when there are a few customers inside who might have wanted to make another purchase). Whatever the case was, I walked inside and ordered up a Carmel Macchiato and a bagel with cream cheese.   Looking around, the place has a definite aviation theme and has some chairs and a couch where patrons can sit around and watch tv or read the morning paper. While I personally didn't feel it to be cozy as some, it seemed like a nice place for locals to have a cup of joe (granted I base my experiences off of my locally eclectic and culturally diverse coffee house in Long Beach).   The girl hands me my drink and while it was super tasty, it was a little bit on the lukewarm side. Not saying I want it scorching hot, but a little hotter would have been nice. But I did love the flavor of my drink.   But my real beef came to when I was handed my bagel. It was toasted...then thrown into a clear plastic carrier with a small single serving of light cream cheese...a plastic knife and a napkin and closed and handed to me. Seriously??? I mean, you can sit outside and hang out with your friend but you can't take the time to cream cheese my bagel???   I guess the crux of my issue with this place is that there feels like there's a lack of sincerity between the establishment / staff and the customer. Maybe because I was a new face??? As It seems by the handful of yelp reviews that the locals love this place. But I didn't feel the love on this visit.   According to their website, their current location is going to close on March 30th due to a rent increase that can't be met. Let's hope they open a new location so they can continue to serve the locals and maybe improve so that out-of-towners like myself are impressed by what they have to offer. Because there's a lot of room for improvement.

NOFX said "Never Trust A Hippy"...  Wonder if Fat Mike ever had a burger here? Because I'd definitely put my trust in these hippies as they know how to make a mean, mean burger.   I was seriously blown away by this place on my first and only visit here. It's funny because my trip here was in due to a few factors. One, I was on my way back to the west side of the valley (Avondale) where my brother lives, after a day of disc golfing in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills. My original eating destination was closed and in a "Plan B" move, I bust out my Yelp App and this place came up as the first suggestion. And with a name like Two Hippies Gnarly Burger Joint...it was a must see and must taste.   The look of the place definitely fits the name. Walking in, you see a hodgepodge of 60s psychedelia, vinyl records, VW bus toys and pictures of classic rockers like Frank Zappa, Jerry Garcia and The Rolling Stones. The menu hangs behind the counter, all done up on a chalkboard. There's even a back room called "The Man Cave" where you can drop in, tune out and pig out amongst vinyl records and other pictures.   It's a build-your-own burger joint where the list of toppings is pretty extensive. You also don't have to do a burger...you can do chicken, portobello mushroom or even cheese steak. And you also have a choice of bun as well...the name of the game here is CHOICE!   They also do various flavors of lemonade...with at least 7-10 favors to choose from.   For this visit, I went with a burger with sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, mustard, guacamole, Swiss cheese on an onion roll. This came with a side of their beer battered onion rings. I also tried one of their peach lemonades. I was able to use my Yelp check-in discount and got my lemonade for half price. Score!   So where to start??? The burger was messy but heavenly!!! Super fresh ingredients and while I thought upon ordering that my burger was going to be a bit too "busy" with all kinds of different flavors, it worked nicely. The onion rings were super light and the actual onions were fresh. The lemonade was refreshing, especially after a day playing golf in the hot Arizona sun. I pretty much destroyed my meal...I mean I SLAMMED it!   I decided to take another lemonade for the road and Sherl (one of the managers, along with her husband) laid on a "MYSTERY" lemonade to me in order to see if I would be able to guess it....  And sure enough, I got it right...and the first person to correctly identify the flavor. So if you are intrigued by this review, go in for a burger...some onion rings...talk to Sherl (she is super nice, very friendly and personable)...take in the "groovy" atmosphere and try to guess the "Mystery" lemonade (or any of the other lemonades)...I guarantee you will not be disappointed.   And to tell the truth, this place is so good I'm really wishing Phoenix was only a few hour drive away...it's that good!

Vista Del Camino DGC (also known as the Shelly Sharpe Memorial DGC) is one of the two courses featured as part of the annual Memorial tournament held every late Febuary / Early March. The other course being Fountain Hills. The course is situated in a public park located smack dab in the middle of Scottsdale. There are two lakes that come into play, which for a So. Cal player who rarely deals with water holes for the most part makes playing here a bit more tricky and challenging.   The first hole is adjacent to a parking lot off of Roosevelt. It's best to either have a map of the course handy when playing or at least take a picture of the posted map so you are aware of where to head next, as this course does have an odd flow if any at all. On this visit (mind you it was also my first), I arrived around 8:30 AM and the park was mostly empty minus a few early morning joggers, people walking their dogs and the occasional senior citizen taking a stroll. I am told that the park does get busy with non-golfers, so be mindful of others who are using the park. There was only one other golfer on the course, who started shortly after I tee'd off on hole 1. You are immediately confronted with a water hazard on the first hole, which according to Ashley who works at Spinners On The Green (disc golf store located near the tee on hole #12), he's witnessed many just move on to hole two because the water shakes their confidence. I personally ended up nearly acing the hole using a Blizzard Destroyer (158 gram)...it's definitely a hole that is meant to intimidate you right away but rewarding if you play it well.    The majority of the course is quite open and flat, playing around some decent sized trees, grassy fields and pedestrian pathways that are considered out of bounds. Again, it's important to know what basket your throwing at as each hole has many different pin positions. A few holes play on the side of slopes near a school and some holes play near apartment buildings, so be careful not to shank discs or they will end up lost or hitting someone's window. Hole 8 was personally one of my favorite holes since it plays rather short with it being on a slope...shoot it too hard and your disc may skip out of bounds (onto the walkway or into the lake)...shoot it too far right and you may end up out of bounds onto the sidewalk / street. Hole 9 is likely the most trickiest drives of the course as the lake is to your right and the walkway to your left is out of bounds, leaving a small landing field in between. This is where the basket is. I had a nice drive with my Blizzard Katana (157 gram) but it stayed stable (straight) for too long over the lake, missing the grass by maybe 15 feet...landing in the lake. I attempted to get the disc out with one of the iron rake devices (which is sold at Spinners, I borrowed mine from a buddy of mine who used to live in AZ and gave it to me for my trip) but had no luck.   The back end of the course plays along the flat short grass fields of the park until you make it to hole 18 which does bring the water into play.   This course was quite fun in all, but I actually found it to be quite easy, minus the out of bounds pathways and the water hazards. I ended my round 3+ (including a lost disc in the water and missing a mandatory...pretty much par'd everything else...plus 2 or 3 birdies). I bet the course becomes more difficult with wind and people enjoying the park, but today I found the course really relaxing and fun. This is definitely a go-to course if you are in the Phoenix area.
