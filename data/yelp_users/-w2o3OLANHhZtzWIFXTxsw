I just had my third appointment at this office and I am so grateful I found them! This is also my third attempt at working with an endo for my thyroid and I feel like I finally found somewhere I can get it controlled with. The office is very clean and well maintained. Every staff member has been knowledgeable, polite and helpful. Scheduling has been super easy for each appointment with plenty of options. I had an 8am appointment today and I was in my car 25 min later. I didn't wait at all today or the last 2 times. I haven't felt rushed in my appointments either, every question answered and very thorough. I met with Dr. Alamir and his Nurse assistant Melanie Westfall, both were excellent. I also had blood work done here and it was super quick and easy. I usually don't bleed and have to get poked a few times or even come back a different day, but he got it on the first try and it was perfect. I have my next few appointments scheduled, my TSH is finally in range, and I highly recommend them.

While going through our home warranty, we had fosters come out to diagnose our pool problem. The repair guy never came in the time they said he would, after 4 messages, which were never returned, we gave up. The next day we get a call that the guy diagnosed it as a clog. The guy absolutely never came out, my dog would have let me know, and he said it was a much different problem than what it ended up being after we had someone else fix it. He wasted a lot of our time and it took a lot longer to find someone else to come fix it. Also, because of his bogus diagnosis, we are having trouble getting the home warranty to cover what the actual problem and repair was. So upset with fosters, would never recommend them. Never had them return any of our messages either. If I could, I would give ZERO stars!! Use someone else.

After trying 3 other places in fountain hills that were all closed, we were so happy to find Sofrita open. Just stopped in for happy hour, and was pleased with their deals. It was pretty quiet on a Monday and we didn't feel rushed at all. Food came out fast and was all really good. The bruschetta was good, with lots of options to choose from. I would definitely come back here to try more of their menu!

So excited to find this delicious spot to close to our home! Stopped here after work to grab take out and everything came out hot, fresh and amazing. We had the philly gyro, which was the best, a chicken and steak entree plate, falafel and baklava. It was all excellent, and we will definitely be back!

I have been using insectek since July 2014 when we moved to the Scottsdale area, and I am glad I did! Gerrit M comes each month and is always exactly on time. He is super thorough gets everything. I have never had someone get all the spider webs and just really know what my house needs. With a toddler and 2 small dogs I like the product they use and how safe it is. We have not had any pest problems since using them. I definition recommend them! So much better than previous companies I have used in other homes.

Most amazing BBQ I have ever tried! Their brisket is absolutely perfect. The ribs are smoky and delicious. Sauces and sides at the perfect touch! Just yum! If you have the chance, try this place asap!

I have been to Salt and Lime three times now and it's safe to say I will be back many more. Two of the times have been with my crazy toddler and everyone has been so great with her! They bring her drink and food quickly and help with anything she needs. The service has been excellent each time, everything comes out correctly and quickly. The food is awesome, and their happy hour specials are amazing! I have tried almost all their tacos and love the combinations! The braised short rib was my favorite, with The ahi tuna being a close second. I really enjoyed the pineapple salsa out of all of their salsa choices! So good, can't wait to go back!

Highly recommend Mr. Appliance for any repairs you may be needing! Chase is wonderful and is amazing to work with! They have excellent customer care, they are fast, and very affordable! I recommend them to all my family and friends when they need something done. You won't regret having them fix your appliances.
