Ok Every Starbucks have a great coffee, tea, great snacks and free WiFi, but this one is special one (in a positive way) and I would drive to here although I have other Starbucks on a walking distance cuz of the great patio that they have. It's in the mall, and always crowded with nice people, I've met few nice friends here.  The best thing about it is that they have outlets for laptop chargers next to every table outside (unlike other starbucks who dont have outlets on their patio's), which makes this place smokers paradise :) The mistes on the patio are on all the time during hot AZ summers, and it's real refreshing experience having your coffe and do some work on your laptop here. WiFi is fast and reliable too.

Awesome food! Very helpful and pleasant staff. Always fresh and delicious DUDE! Great place for take out food. Convenient place with their own parking spots. They are accepting orders by phone, and have great lunch specials. My favorite is their chicken teriyaki bowl. Don't forget to get loyalty card, one free meal with purchase of 10.

Awful  place. Don't go! They will rip you off. I had my car overheating and I had to stop at their location and get it fixed asap because I had to be at work that day. It was just the thermostat that needed to be replaced, and other mechanics will charge no more than 110$ for that. They told me that beside the thermostat the radiator hoses needed to be changed and I don't know what else. I agreed because I had no other choice at the moment. They charged me 360$, and told me that it will be an hour work. On the end it was 5 and a half hours of work. Totally DISHONEST mechanics. You don't want to go there if you want to save yourself lots of money and stress.
