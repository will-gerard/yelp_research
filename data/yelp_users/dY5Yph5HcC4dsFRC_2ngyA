Food is basic chain food-nothing special but the service is horrific!  Went to dinner during a ballgame and could not get basic service even though it was not crowded.  They could have twice the bill if the servers stopped by once in a while. I will never go again. Next time I will eat before the game or in the ballpark. Don't waste your money with this place. Very disappointing considering our bill was 75 each times 5 people. Very bad experience.

I have been going to Jordan's since the mid 1960's and it has been a family institution ever since.  I grew up going for tacos every single Friday.  Birthday's and all family visitors were whisked to Jordan's and thus the traditions began.  I had a server named Lottie for my entire life until she passed away.  Servers stay there and there has to be a reason for that.  The food is "comfort food" and just reminds you of something that you've known your whole life.  My children grew up on Jordan's every time they went to Grandma and PaPa's house.  By the time they left for college, Jordan's was the first stop when I picked them up at Sky HArbor.  Even today, I buy it and take it to all my kids when I leave to go out of town.  I've had to get very creative packing it on the plane.  People who don't "get" Jordan's should go to a tourist trap and be happy.  This is old school and a family restaurant that has made generations of people very happy.  Jordan's holds a very special memory in our family traditions.

I have been a member since 2000, but only used my membership for the car service calls up until a few years ago when I discovered many more reasons to use the membership perks.  I have used the DMV services regularly and haven't had to go to the DMV since.  LOVE it.  The people are helpful and really take the time to explain what needs to be done.  Then about 2 years ago I made the decision to take my first international trip.  I had the pleasure of getting set up with Annette as my travel planner and I can't begin to express how knowledgeable and helpful she has been.  Her tips, patience, and attention to details have made the traveling planning process a great deal of fun.  I've had to move the dates twice, and plan many side adventures and Annette has given advice all along the way.  I was nervous to go on the trip, but felt that Annette has been instrumental in the process.  AAA has a gem in an employee such as Annette and I look forward to planning many more trips with her leading the way.

After going to 5 or 6 places in the area, I was lucky enough to find this location. Bob is extremely knowledgeable and makes sure that the customer gets what they need. As I was looking at beds, I heard him helping other people and he treated them so well that I waited for him. He really helped me compare so I could get the right bed for my guest room. I highly recommend this store and the salesman named Bob.

I reluctantly got drug to this restaurant becasue I had been there several years ago and had NOTHING good to say about it.  Well that has completely been changed now.  I have a close friend who selects this restaurant everytime it is her choice and now I have become a BIG FAN.  I have been there about 9 times in the past 6 months and every single time I have eaten there, it has been superb.  The service has been impeccable.  We usually have Steve and he is very attentive and remembers us each time we come.  I love some of their specials, especially the peppers.  Each Italian entree I have had has been delicious.  Their deserts are fabulous.  I especially love the eclair cake and lemochello.  My friend also loves their cannoli's and their pork chop dinner.  The place is in a strip mall, but who cares???  The food is great, the service is exceptional, and the atmosphere is clean and nice.  We had a dinner group meeting there a few weeks ago and the 3 other women who had been there for the first time were quite impressed.

There is no better place to go for fresh delicious donuts. If you get there early, the selection is amazing. I've been late in the day where there is not much left but went ahead and tried what they had left and that was still amazing.  You will never get donuts anywhere else if you go here. They are definitely worth it.

This a a great local place where you can get diner food and be treated like they are happy to have you drop by for a meal. The first time I went, I felt like an outsider because everyone seemed to know each other and the servers. The second time I went-the servers remembered me and welcomed me back. They even remembered what I drank. Needless to say-this a a friendly local place with simple good food at an affordable price. They must be doing something right because there is always a nice crowd of people but you can still get a table. They top off your drinks the entire meal!!  I enjoy this cafe and frequent it often.

I just went for the very first time. I was having a nostalgic moment and decided I would hit the local branch near my home. Growing up, my mother bought several Kinds of Easter Candy that were always in the basket. Then she continued the tradition with my children. My mother passed away 8 years ago and this year I suddenly remembered the candies. I went in last week and immediately spotted the candies. The service was delightful and they seemed happy to help a newcomer. I mailed all the candies to my grown children who were delighted with the memories created of their beloved Grandmother. I'm really happy that I sauntered in and I plan to continue the tradition as well as starting some new ones.

I used to live in the delivery area and raised my kids having delivery every other week from House of Yang. I now live about 25 minutes but still pick up orders every few weeks. The food is consistently prepared and there are many great options. I've tried many of the dishes and have never been disappointed. We used to get a variety of orders and eat family style but if you are solo, they have great lunch combos. I highly recommend House of Yang.  The places in my delivery zone are not as good and thus I continue to grab take out. Try it.

Spent the entire day there for Sunday Funday football games. There was good and bad. First the service we had was exceptional. Our server was attentive, gave refills, kept up with our many orders, and kept all the checks separate for about 5 different sets of people. We stayed so long because of her service. There were some hits and misses as for the food. Beer cheese pretzel appetizer was terrific and we ended up having 4 or 5 of them between our large group. The soup was alright-nothing special and the grilled cheese was a triple decker (way too big with the mozzarella and cheddar on the sandwich. Fries were good.  Great beer choices and the television screens were perfect for watching with a large group. The bathroom floor (upstairs) was so sticky that it was gross.  We all had a great time, and the server really made a difference. She wasn't flirty at all-she just paid close attention to us all.  Based on the service, I would return and our group said the same

I love this place so much that I get take out from here on a weekly basis.  If I have company that want to go to authentic local food (nothing fancy), then I head to La Fonda.  Easy to get in.  Nothing fancy, but good food and good service.  Their servers have been there a while and always remember me which is a nice touch.  Their tamales are made fresh and are DELICIOUS.  Their salsa is fresh and yummy.  The place is "old Scottsdale" for sure, but you will enjoy it.  There are always a lot of people eating, but I never seem to have to wait.

I was invited here for a birthday dinner and had a wonderful meal along with pristine service. We both had salads to start. Perfect size for an appetizer salad. Not too small and had lots of fresh veggies. I had the filet mignon and my friend had the prime rib. We both had sides (potato and asparagus. The meat was a perfect medium rare as ordered and the sides were simple and tasty. The atmosphere was dark wood and reminded me of Houston's. The service was terrific. Friendly, refills, and we didn't have to remind her of anything. All dressings were on the side as asked. Will definitely go here again and will highly recommend.

We walked in to grab some drinks and seated ourselves on the patio. After 25 minutes and never having anyone come and get our order, we re-seated ourselves inside. Still no one approached us. (There was no hostess so you were expected to seat yourself. Finally we moved to the bar and after some effort got the bartender to come over. We ordered several rounds of beers and margaritas and nothing was said to us other than a few grunts. We finally found a taco form and ordered a few.  We gave the form to the bartender and he took it (again without responding to us). The tacos were good but the service was horrendous. Won't go back as there are many places to spend your money that actually want your business. It was pretty empty on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. perhaps the bad service is a factor.

I forget about this place but when I end up there I always enjoy it and have a great meal. Went there with a friend last week. Service was good and refills flowed. They also regressed the salsas which is always appreciated. Had the combo with tamale and enchilada. Tasty for sure. Took some take home for the rest of the family and the server also made sure we packed up the leftovers. I will remember that I want to return. Nice family place.

I have heard about this place for years and in fact my son raves about the fish dinner he gets from here. I finally went when a friend dragged me for trivia night. So glad she did because this place is quite good. The atmosphere is eclectic and very comfortable. You feel like they want your business which as a customer I certainly appreciate. my drink was refilled over 4 times and I never asked. The food was delicious. We all got something different and each of us said it was great. We also tried a desert to share and it was enormous and definitely was good for 3 or 4 people. We weren't able to finish it. I highly recommend this charming place and I plan to return and try some of the dishes I read about in the reviews. I played it safe with a green  chili burger but it was spectacular. Very unique.  My friend had the appetizer tacos which she said were spicy and delicious. The other people both had specialty burgers. Loved this place-will return.

I have been here so many times and tried many of their options. You can't go wrong with their half sandwich and soup (which comes in a tiny bread bowl. All of their sandwiches are great and they make them to order. The breads are so fresh and all ingredients ares but fresh each day. Their cookies are tasty and only $1. Go there-you will be glad you discovered this gem. You can even order a toasted cheese with tomato soup for a comfort food extravaganza. I add avocado and tomato to the sandwich and it is over the top.   Love this place and I've introduced many people and they all have enjoyed it. Also-the service is super friendly and they always remember who you are and what you like. Plus-they have wi-fi!!!

I call this place "Fancy Fry's" because it is a step above all other grocery stores. The only reason I lowered the rating is that they have free wi-fi that seldom works. When you report it, one of the managers made it clear that it was free and they don't have to fix it. I used to spend a lot of time there as I was tutoring, but stopped going when they couldn't keep the Internet running. I highly doubt they built such a beautiful area because they don't want people to frequent the food court area. They need to get their internet up to speed and make sure that employees know what to do when it goes down.  Most of the employees are terrific.

I'd prefer you not go so the line wouldn't be as long! Just kidding because this place is the real deal. Whatever you order will be authentic and delicious.  The tamales, Burros, tacos, enchilada's are legit!  No matter what you get, add a dozen of their homemade tortillas to be blown away. It's obviously great because every time I go, there are many other regulars waiting for their fix. If you call ahead, you will get to pick up your order at a separate counter and will get to skip the line.

Both of my kids used to frequent this place and tonight we finally all went together and got take out for a group of people. Needless to say, it was a BIG hit!  We got the jalapeño hummus and regular hummus and both were delicious.  The pizza puff and fries were top notch. The gyros was delicious and the meat was so tender. The Greek salad and Greek gyros salad were spectacular.   The sauces were delicious and every single person was thrilled with their food.  This restaurant is now on my radar and I plan to be back many times!

I love this place and wish it was close to me. We go when we are leaving town on the way to California and have never been disappointed. Service is always friendly and skilled. The food is good old fashioned  comfort food. Highly recommend this place. Breakfasts are great and have all the biscuit and gravy options as well as traditional breakfast fare.

I started the process to find a carpet cleaning service by asking friends.  None of my friends were really happy with the last place they tried so I hit Yelp and called 4 or 5 places.  I selected Epic based on the reviews I read and their professionalism when I called.  i ended up booking them to do my carpets and my couches.  When the guy arrived (on time), he cleaned the carpets and they looked terrific.  He then went and looked at my couches very carefully and advised me that the labels said that it needed to be dry cleaned.  He discussed the situation with me and I decided to wait.  They had another worker who specialized in dry cleaning the couches and I scheduled him for 2 days later.  When he arrived, he read the label and checked the fabric and explained the differences in the two procedures.  I decided to go ahead and steam clean them and they looked amazing when he finished and dried beautifully.  I appreciated how careful both technicians were and that they cared that I was happy with their work.  Also, I received followup calls after both services to make sure that I was happy with the service.  I will definitely use this company again and have already recommended them to others.

I wish I could give this place 10 stars! I love tamales, BUT I am very picky that they not be too dry.  These tamales are AMAZING.  I've tried most of the tamales, but look forward to getting there and seeing which ones are fresh.  So far my favorite are the Red Beef, but I love all of them.  I prefer that they are all take out because I like that they focus only on tamales.  if they became a restaurant, I imagine they would start adding all kinds of other items.  Tamales are difficult to find AND good ones are even harder to find.  I am grateful to YELP for turning me on to this great place.

I love Greek food but I have eaten here at least five times and I will now only go to it if a friend chooses it. The acoustics are awful and I feel like I am hearing everyone except who I am with.  No one who serves customers has a smile. If I spend money I expect the servers to act like they enjoy their jobs. I love to tip but at Pita Jungle I feel like I am giving money away to servers who hate their jobs and are annoyed with anybody that they must serve. This is my first negative review. It's such a nice place so it annoys me that the service is subpar. I've had better Greek food just about everywhere else I go.  I had high hopes for this place, but it is just not good (especially for the price).

I've been going to this restaurant (several locations) for over 25 years. It is reliable and has some great meals. I especially like the #7 Best of Everything sandwich.  I often order it for delivery but usually my order is incorrect. Usually I just go with it because it is too complicated to call and have them correct it every time   I leave notes every single time about the errors and asking that they double check order. It never matters --it is always wrong. I called a few times ago because even the pizza was wrong. (Wrong size and toppings). They corrected it because the other house got my order-- never adjusted price.  If I were running the restaurant I would want to make sure that the customer got the order they made.  I hope that they get their delivery system improved because I really enjoy the restaurant.  I actually do delivery orders weekly from the restaurant (probably about 20 times). The order has been correct about 4 times so there is a strong likelihood for a problem. Missing dressing, sides, or the wrong entree are common problems. I like the food and sometimes I just need delivery and the choices for restaurants that deliver are limited. The delivery people are VERY nice and I appreciate their good service.

Been here many times but stopped going because they time how long you can use their internet (short time) and then it turns off. Doesn't matter if you are with a large party and everyone is eating. Internet is times and management cannot turn it back on. Too many other places want my business and will provide Internet so I can work. Won't miss Paradise Bakery.

I have been going here for many years and I will go out of my way to ship everything through them. They care about every single person that walks in and take the time to find out what your needs are so that you don't "overpay" for shipping services you won't need. They provide excellent service and I feel like I am going into a neighborhood business where "everyone knows your name". I highly recommend them for all things shipping!

We were there with a group of about 15.  Our group was there for about 5 hours. We all ordered in waves and the server did a great job of keeping track of us all. Refills were hard to get-in fact I don't think we got any. Beers and shots were handled just fine. Only half the group ate and everyone was happy with their food.  I would go again but the high stools get so uncomfortable after a few hours. Definitely a reason we moved on

I was lucky the day that my friend referred me to One Love Boutique as it taught me the difference between waxing at a nail salon and waxing by a trained professional.  WOW.  I regularly book facials and waxing with Amanda, but have also used others when she is out of town.  First of all, the place is CLEAN and trendy.  Everyone is welcoming and it is an organized business.  The owner, Amanda, actually has a Business degree as well as her other training.  She is savvy and knows what she is doing to meet the needs of her clientele.  She carries Jan Marini products, has a small boutique of clothes, and all kinds of other little perks.  I HIGHLY recommend this Salon and know that fellow Yelpers will not be disappointed.  QUALITY QUALITY QUALITY!

Was on the patio for a private party. It was so hot and I desperately wished I could go inside and cool off. The food was served buffet style and was an assortment of appetizers and were tasty traditional bar food. The buffalo chicken sliders were delicious. We were very impressed by the great service and our glasses were never empty. I was only drinking water and tea and they were refilled continuously. I will definitely go back and order off the menu. There was a nice crowd there and the staff seems friendly and accommodating. Definitely glad they are in the neighborhood

Went for dinner with 2 regulars who recommended this gem. The service was terrific and he suggested some dishes which we tried. I had the soup of the day (corn chowder) and the brown bag chicken sandwich. Both were amazing. One of my friends had a salad with the daily special pot pie. He said it was delicious. We had delicious cocktails and enjoyed the night. The restaurant is trendy and comfy with delightful patio seating. I will return and can't wait to take other friends here.

I read all the reviews on Yelp and planned to head over tonight. We certainly were not disappointed as everything we had was every bit as good or better than all the rave reviews. Lots of special touches and each item was delicious. We had the burger, pulled pork, and toasted cheese along with some sides.  The owner and employees were friendly and gave impeccable service.  I have definitely added this place to my list of "go to" restaurants. Yes it's in a strip mall and casual!  Perfect for lunch or dinner.

I think these are probably the best donuts I've had out. Remind me so much of donuts from my childhood and ones my Grandma made in her kitchen. Very friendly and appreciate the business. Every time I go, I feel valued as a customer.  It is not close to me but I drive over there just to pick them up for company. The variety is so nice as well as all the other menu items they have. Give it a try. It's a gem.

I was searching for a computer guy knowledgeable on dual platforms. I have both a Mac and a PC to deal with and Aaron is the REAL deal. He is so knowledgeable and researches extra things after he leaves to provide even further service. He handled my printer, modem, router, and the computers when Cox and HP could not get the wireless printing to stay working. He have us so many tips to write down and refer to that have actually saved me a lot of money. He right away explained why the brand new $160 combo router and modem would be problematic. Saved me money and now it all works great.  I recommend this guy. I have referred him to others who have called me raving. I have him on speed dial and he's my first call for computer related issues. He's reasonably priced and well worth his fees.

Vincent is the kind of small business that YOU want to support.  He is organized and maintains a professional demeanor.  I called 3 places that I had referrals for and chose Vincent based on the reviews and his professional behavior.  He emails reminders and confirmations.  He arrives on time and does a complete job.  He also pointed a few things out to me about my windows that I should pay attention to.  I have referred him to several people and will definitely use him again.

Mike is GREAT.  He answers right away and sets up a convenient location to meet and fixes the phone in 15 minutes.  I can't believe how professional and fast he is able to do the work.  He brings all the parts and tools with him and changes out the screen.  It is certainly NOT easy to do this, but he makes it look like he has done it thousands of times.  highly recommend

I haven't had a bug problem for over three years, but started noticing gnats and other tiny bugs.  I found Watts Pest Prevention on Yelp and called for information.  After talking to the knowledgeable office girl, i still wasn't sure if I would create a bigger problem spraying and then drawing out more bugs.  The owner called me and went over options in detail.  I decided to move forward and got a followup call from the office to schedule.  They are SUPER organized and sent me an email confirming my time and letting me set up an online account.  I received a reminder call the day before with a 2 hour time frame and a promise to call with a 30 minute warning.  Germaine arrived just as promised with a call letting me know he was on his way.  Germaine came in my house and assessed the bug problem and gave me advice how to proceed.  I was so impressed with his professionalism and knowledge.  He answered all our questions and made sure that he checked everything carefully and then sprayed inside and out.  I will definitely start regular service and refer them to others.  VERY IMPRESSED--VERY professional company.

The atmosphere is fabulous.  The weather was perfect and we were able to sit in the Yard area and stayed most of the afternoon. We had Yesterday's soup which is a great concept as the flavor is always better next day (as the menu stated).   Also tried the pretzels, Fish and Chips, and sampled many beers. Our server was tremendous.  He was a musician who made our day much more enjoyable as he engaged in fun conversations with us as he took care of us.  Service was perfect--we wanted for nothing!  We weren't very hungry so I will definitely go again and try some of the other menu items.  Can't wait to go back.

I have eaten here about 5 times. The food is good but the service is quite frustrating. It starts off great and then the service goes downhill. Refills for drinks are impossible and when they deliver the food it is impossible to ask for a condiment because the server just disappears. Once they up-sale cocktails and appetizers, the friendly service is gone. The last 3 times we could not get out in under 2 1/2 hours and never got a refill for the non-alcoholic drinks and waited over half hour for the check. We finally had to trap a different server to PLEASE find our server to get our check. Frustrating. I've stopped going and when asked I have suggested another restaurant where my business is valued. I feel that 5 visits is enough.  By the way I always tip over 20%, was a server, and genuinely never complain about service unless it's warranted. Service has to be good start to finish, not up until the order is taken.

Met a large group of women there for a birthday happy hour. Had the daily special drink which was delicious. It was an orange vodka based cocktail. We ordered most of the appetizers and shared. The Brussel sprouts were good but not as flavorful as others I've had. Others enjoyed the chopped salad. The pretzel, sausage and cheese place was a hit. The service was excellent and we all enjoyed the patio experience.  I would return if I was in the area but probably wouldn't go out of my way to get to midtown for it.

I met with my dinner group there tonight.  It was selected by a gal who frequents it. There were 5 in our group. We started with the delicious blood orange margarita's that the server recommended and they were delicious. We enjoyed chips, salsa, and the fresh guacamole as the appetizer. I ordered the short rib tacos, and others ordered enchiladas, fish tacos, and grilled fish. The sides were beans and rice.  Our service was outstanding with refills given frequently. The atmosphere was modern and comfortable. I would definitely go again and would recommend to others.

I saw this pop up down the street, read the reviews, and headed there today. This is my new "go-to" spot for subs. Atmosphere  feels so upbeat and there were friendly sandwich makers eager to explain the options.  Lots of firehouse references and decor. The sandwich I had was "the Italian but I will try others. I mentioned I had been there to several friends today and they all have it a big thumbs up as well. So happy to have this shop in the neighborhood!

I found this bakery by accident because I was having a baby shower and a birthday party and 5 days before the event, my baker had a serious accident. I called Sweets Unlimited and they rescued me. I was very impressed with their professionalism and concern that my events go off without a hitch. I did not want fondant used except for the small decorations because it just does not taste as good. They did everything with the cream cheese frosting I wanted and I was so happy. All of the guests were blown away by how delicious the desserts were because beautiful cakes normally taste so bad. I will definitely use them in the future and highly recommend them to others.

This place has been on my radar for a while and we finally got there yesterday. We ordered a variety for takeout so we could try lots of items. I especially like that they have 1 size pizza (indication to me that it would be good). New York style-we got pepperoni, onion, and basil. Delicious-we will definitely call ahead and puck up again. Had a sausage calzone which was tasty-just the right amount of everything. Got the baked Ziti which came with a nice little side salad. Simple greens with a few tiny tomatoes. Nothing special but it was fresh.  Nice touch that they have fresh Parmesan. Will definitely head back. I'd give it a 5 if the salad was a little more substantial. Glad this place is in the neighborhood.

I've been back several more times. Sad to say that they haven't gotten the service issues fixed. You just need to go and realize that you have to accept what they bring and how they serve it. Condiments that you want and service are just not going to happen. Example: breakfast toast served with no butter or jelly. Server disappears and doesn't return until you beg to get the check.  Asked for salsa with the eggs and also didn't get that. The food was ok but when you pay for a meal out, people tend to want the things that they expected. I agree with others that the tables are too small (chairs too). LOUD most of the time unless you sit outside.

This center has the friendliest people and is more welcoming than most places. There are a variety of class times and all of the instructors are simply amazing-so much fun. Highly recommend this center-they have fun activities in addition to the classes. I've met some terrific people.

I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this place. It is so clean and relaxing. I prefer a quiet atmosphere so I can chill. They have free wi-fi which is nice to relax while watching a program on my iPad. I've been there 6 times since they opened and each time has been lovely. It can get crowded so you should be patient or plan in advance. They have several options for pedicure and manicure so there is a Price that will work for everyone. I had gone for 8 years to my former salon and I have switched to Herbal Nails.  I'm thrilled they are in my neighborhood.

I couldn't be happier that I found this gem in my neighborhood. I am always "thinking" about projects I need fixed or repaired and this shop really does it all. I had a dad diaper bag that I wanted to embellish with some patches without interfering with the aesthetic look and functionality of the bag. I was able to make my son's diaper bag reflect his alma mater and it will be a hit. Markel went over the details with me and when I arrived for pick up, he remembered me and the bag was ready. It was beautifully sewn and I couldn't be happier. I will be back with more projects!   PS--he does so many other things! Shoe repairs, watch batteries, etc

I went here for the first time and I am definitely going back. The food we had between us was all fabulous. The soup was terrific. I had the chicken tortilla and it was delicious. The DC chicken sandwich was good and I plan to taste other sandwiches in future weeks. The Internet is  great. The customer service is outstanding. Every single employee is smiling and helpful. It is obvious that the owner is working with the staff. He introduced himself to us and then we saw him helping the staff all around the store. He was friendly and encouraging to the staff and I love seeing that. The desserts were delicious. Can't wait to go again. Already told a few of my friends about it and I'm thrilled it is in the neighborhood. If you like Paradise Bakery (which I don't) head here instead. Hands down-this place blows them out of the water.

I am thrilled that there is a new place in the neighborhood and am truly hoping that it does well.  I will definitely try it again because I see the potential and think I may have ordered the wrong thing, but it is all I can review.  My daughter had the BBQ chicken sandwich with cole slaw and she liked it.  She said, "It's no Honey Bears, but very good".    I had their special Dank Sandwich.  The nice cashier repeatedly said to me when I asked about the sauce that it was a "relish sauce".  I guess I should have ordered something different, but I usually like to try a specialty.  The meat was tender and delicious, but it was not  BBQ sauce at all--it was like straight relish.  Don't get me wrong, I love relish so I figured it was infused into the BBQ sauce and would just give it some flavor.  I ate half of it and that was enough because the relish overload was just too much. I also thought if they named a sandwich after their business, it must be a favorite.  It is not something I will ever order again.     Sides we tried:  mac and cheese, cole slaw, and beans.  The beans were delcious and I would definitely get them again.  Mac and cheese was bland, but ok to eat.  Nothing special.  The cole slaw was also fine, but nothing special.  We would have tried the Apple Pie, but they were out of them.    All in all, I will try it again.  I read all the good reviews, and I think i will try some different items.  I HATE to give this place a low rating, but I am hoping that next visit will be better.  The service was excellent and the people are friendly.  It is also priced right.  I will definitely edit this review if I have a different impression.

I accidntally found this place when my car got towed to the AAA Repair shop across the way.  The AAA guy recommended Kneaders so we walked across the parking lot to Kneaders.  What a treat.  The bakery case is extensive--so many beautiful choices.  The service was friendly and welcoming.  We had sandwich and soup combos and both were delicious.  The bread was fresh and tasty.  We were pleasantly surprised and then grabbed some treats to go.  I had a BLT specialty sandwich called Dave's BLT that also had cheese and onion on it.  Really delicious--would definitely get it again.  Can't wait to go back.  Need to explore the menu because there were so many things that we wanted to try.  I can't emphasize enough how fresh the food was.  Also the place was CLEAN and decorated in a very friendly way.  It just feels warm and inviting.

Had been wanting to try this place since it is in the neighborhood.   Pros Menu has many options and fun variations. The BLT includes avocado and fried tomatoes. Yummy We had some appetizers which were both delicious. Zucchini and fried pickles.   The menu had so many fun choices and we wanted to try many of the options.   Looks like they have an interesting whiskey menu-they had some unique options The person who sat us was friendly and gave us the impression that service would be great even though he had no idea if they had Hudson Baby Bourbon and did not check   Cons We were told when we sat that Kristen or a similar name would be right over-well there was a girl in the bar watching all the other tables and she never came. Made direct eye contact with us repeatedly but never bothered to see if we needed service. We were in her area and clearly had nothing (no drinks, menus, etc. After 20 full minutes we were able to grab a waiter from another area and see if he could get us menus, drinks and take our order. He was very nice and said he would get us started and find "Kristen". Again she never arrived so we asked the guy if he could help us. He did and gave us great service. I would have told someone as I left but I couldn't even figure out who to tell.   The food was good but I prefer to have some service as I can't take my own order into the kitchen. I did figure out the whiskeys once I got a menu. Service is a real issue here. The bartender seemed to be talking to a table of her own friends and that is why she was unable to serve us. Would have liked refills   I would have given the food 4 stars, the menu would have gotten 5 stars but when service is that bad, I just can't do it. Will I try again?  Not sure
