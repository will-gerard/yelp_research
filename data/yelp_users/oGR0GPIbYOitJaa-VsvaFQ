The BEST barber shop in Phoenix, Scottsdale. I am a longtime customer , offers excellent prices and outstanding customer service.. Michael the owner is always in the shop - very little turnover with staff. Try a straight edge shave    Its awesome - live a little !!!

I am a Long time customer - Resturant offers homemade cooked food and from scratch .. Resturant is family owned and operated not a chain Resturant- worth the trip and money!! Owner is often working and in the store to see hello and supervises his staff. Broasted fish and chicken are excellent when you fall off the diet.  Many good Italian dishes and pizza is good too. Excellent cold cuts and cheeses and utilizing bread.

This place is small and stifling,, dirty and little effort and thought about the customer experience ( decorations, lighting, hostess stand, signs,). I stood in the doorway Saturday night and waited for 7-10 minutes for someone to seat me or even make eye contact. No signs just be seated or wait to be seated ? Strange but I couldn't have just taken a table anyway, because the 3 or4 tables that were empty were still  dirty and unattended..  Not at all on the ball for sure! Good indication of the food servers and pace of service!! Overwhelmed and only seating for 30-35 people MAX.. Tables are on top of each other.   So I walked back to rear counter , soda or serving station, I assume cashier ? and was approached by a lady and asked what I wanted? I said dinner and she replies me too !! I couldn't believe it !!!, I assume she is the owners wife? if so , I suggest telling your wife to stay home. , if she isn't I would TERM her., SHE IS COSTING YOU BUSINESS --- if you want to be a comedian get out the restaurant business.. NICE FIRST IMPRESSION ! --NOT   At that point I knew this place is a disaster ( go with your gut) and she is not interested in quality customer service or friendly service. I despise shitty attitudes and unfriendly people AND dirty restaurants where  tables are empty and dirty and you have to sit next to them and eat your meal. Come on ,hire a damn busboy for $8 / hr ( I was one years ago), these high school kids want jobs to.. . This business thinks small and could care less about growing there business.  So I walked out and drove .5 miles to My Big Fat Greek restaurant ( old faithful) and had a excellent dinner once again, so much for trying something new! Don't waste your time or your money here!

Took the family for a birthday dinner,  Bread was the starter and olive oil and was the best part of dinner.   started with blue cheese wedge - average at best only a couple red onion slices and two tomato slices - no cucumber no bacon, no crotons.  Other order was eggplant with pasta it was again average at best - egg plant was paper thin not recommended. The other dinners were chicken parmigiana was the better choice, really cutting corners- maybe there attracting tourists but not locals- I give over under in 2 years..   As I checked in I received a 20% off for one entrée and the waitress had to take my phone and track down the manager to verify my $4.00 discount- LOL--How funny and very unprofessional is that- chasing the manager through the kitchen with my personal phone thinking I was trying to get over for $4.00--unreal!! Just think average plate is 25 plus if I was worried about money I would of chosen a chain restaurant ( Olive Garden is a better choice and quality better) try North , Guidos, or Giuseppe   Or Nina's Restaurants all in Scottsdale /North Phoenix close by.  I've eaten here before and this establishment is going downhill- there are many better choices than Nicks - don't waste your money or time!!  The  good news was the waitress Toni was attentive and polite but so are most professionals.

Over priced and small portions for the $$$. Don't waste your time or money . Service is average , .. More of a bar, no draft beers I find odd, Tons of better sushi restaurants in Scottsdale  and Phoenix !!! Just believe in YELP they rated this 3.5 , I should of listened to my friends:)..

Impressed  , stopped 2 x before and the wait was to long . Made reservations for 5 this time.;).. Friends had recommened and raved about Becketts and had this on the short list for awhile. It was everything as advertised, ambiance very casual , GOOD Food, excellent service (  Adria was very good and made good recommendations ) and fair prices . Recommend the Osso  Bucco pork but not a bad meal by the group . Sunday is AZ winery special which is a nice touch , must try the Pimms cup cocktail excellent! Can't wait to go back!,!,

Not that good . Average at best.. No Bok Choy and Pho was served warm  this was first.Spring rolls were good but $3.50 per roll are overpriced. Very limited menu for my liking - Pho Dalat in Tempe off Elliott Rd is preferred , much better food  , better menu options and price is more favorable. I could not recommend  the Rice Paper , I am about the food !!!

The ratings by other Yelpers was accurate .. YELPERS! Food is expensive and average ... $15 Marg with Don Julio... $4.00 taco's ( small ) and stuffed chili with chicken was$19.00 , ... best item was the fresh of the guacamole& chips.. -- probably be back for Happy Hour sometime but will pass on dinner or lunch ..  2 for dinner and 2 drinks each and the bill was 90.00... Oh we'll..

This was our First time we tried Bianco Pizza , we heard so many good comments about how great the pizza is!   The ingredients were fresh but I guess my expectations were so high and they undelivered. 1 salad , 2 drinks 2 pizza all for $77.00 plus tax and tip totaled $96.00...   Oh well Cibo pizza knocks it out of the park compared to this resturant. $15 personal pizza is not worth the money, service was average same as the food and drinks..   My Moscow mule was served in a glass - sorry but mules should be served in a cooper mug - get a clue .. Drink was weak and not very good.  The way to sum it up is average restaurant and not worth the wait , money or time!! Sorry just being honest ..  Ciao

Had 2 bikes repaired - came in at 5:50 to pickup my bikes  ( 2 young guys) stayed late adding accessories that I wanted at the last minute- they went the extra mile and installed them without being pissed and had smile and seemed glad i was there as a customer -- you don't see that These days -- even though that I  kept them late. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this shop..

Consumers beware - check Register of Contractors-- BBB. We paid Tom Henson cash up front to repair our pool- City had red tagged it for incompetence in work and does not meet code. We never met the owner but Tom the son is a pathological liar and subbed the work out to a non license contractor.   Classic bait and switch - company has numerous claims pending and lost his license , protect your family this guy is psycho to deal with !  Our pool still leaks what a nightmare- spare yourself the stress !

Carley ( owner) was awesome a true professional and well worth my time and money she is very meticulous.  Office room was  set up cool and very comfortable , I had no trouble relaxing more of a high end Spa feel something you would find at Camelback Inn or JW Marriott . I would highly recommend her business to my family & friends.
