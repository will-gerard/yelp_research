Second time getting my oil changed here.   The guys here are friendly and have excellent customer service.   Very quick and easy to get in for an oil change at the last minute.

For the pharmacy:  I have been using this pharmacy practically my entire life. Aaron is great, he remembers me and my family by name and is willing to answer any question.   Just recently the only person I encounter here is a short middle age woman with dark brown hair in a pony tail. She's rude. She lacks personality and a tiny customer service smile. I dread picking up prescription from her.   When I have my hand out as you are HANDING me my prescription normally that's when you place it in someone's HAND. Not just smack it down on the counter and walk away. She is a total B**ch. Should stick to filling the prescriptions because a personality lacking robot would be a little nicer.

Brandon was a great help. My car battery was dead and he got me in and out within a few minutes.

WORST dining experience.   The dinner was for my best friends birthday and her two sisters birthdays which fall the day before.   We called two hours prior to make a reservation for 9 adults and 2 children. We were told we couldn't make a reservation. So we ended up getting there a 7 to wait. We told Kat it was for 9 and 2 babies. She put us down, but when she did it was for 5 people. We again told her 9 adults 2 kids. She seemed very confused by her job. After reassuring that 9+2=11 multiple times she put us down for 11 people even after continuing to get it wrong when talking to the other lady tiffany. Honestly these woman were incompetent. I'm not sure if they could even handle rolling silverware but they definitely shouldn't be running the front.   She never asked for our name or gave an estimated wait time. After 15 minutes of waiting she told us our table was being set up. Almost 30 minutes later they came and called for our table, another group was confused for us and they gave the table we had been waiting for away to another group. After we told her she called the manager. Finally they went and looked for a place to seat us. We waited and hour all together even after being told only a few minutes for the table to be set up.   Once we were finally seated we were thankful. We had two waiters and both introduced themselves and took our drink and appetizer orders. When one came back he only brought the appetizers and one side of the tables drinks. We asked again for our water and bread and waited about another 10-15 minutes. Still no one brought those who had nothing to drink, something to drink or bread. We finally asked two guys clearing tables to bring us  water and bread. I also canceled my drink and only wanted water because I had already been waiting too long. We finally got some water but AGAIN had to ask for bread. Even though I canceled my drink they ended up bringing it and asked if I just wanted it since it was already made. I said I guess, even though it was canceled. (They ended up charging me for it, even though i told them it was canceled twice).   The manager came over a few times to try and set things right even though we were all extremely unsatisfied by that point.   By the time we did get our food everyone was ready to leave and they were already about to close at 10 anyways. So we asked for boxes to take the food to go. 15 minutes and no one comes with boxes. Finally someone comes back and asks if we need boxes.... Even after we already asked. Waited again, finally after more waiting we got boxes. By this point I had enough. Honestly if you need two waiters for one table one of them shouldn't just bail out and never come back. It was one waiter for all is us but after asking other people about 5 different people had to take our requests.   Needles to say it was a complete disaster and a fantastic way to ruin 3 people's birthday dinner.

The fact that you can't use debit outside is a little annoying. But when credit is the only option you would think the machine would at least ask for a zip code!!!!  Anyone could steal a card and fill up their tank here. I wouldn't be shocked if it happens all the time here since it's practically methville around there.    Fix your debit machine on the pumps or at least require a zip code!

Cecil made the loan process a breeze!   The special they have on personal loans at 7.9% can really not be beat. That is what brought me in after being referred to them for a personal loan.   The customer service couldn't have been better! I appreciate that the staff is personable but professional and even laughed at my stupid jokes. :P   I would refer my family and friends.   Thank you guys!

I go to quite a few Dunkins in the area and this one is by far the best. All the employees here are friendly and remember me. Although the drive thru is slow sometimes. I feel as though the long played our speech at the intercom might have something to do with it. Some times I feel like they're joking with how slowly they say "Weeeelllcome tooo Dunnnnkin Donutsssss, whattt are youuu drinkingggg?!" But other than that they're pretty quick and don't cut you off while you order.  I've sent my coffee back a few times for tasting watered down and have never had a problem. They're always so nice and quick to remake it for me.  I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the annoyingly long speech at the intercom.

My appointments here have always been good. This is the only office I have visited. The staff is great in their original location are great, very friendly and quick to get you back on time.  At my last annual visit I was directed to a different office they have adjacent to their normal office. The waiting room is tiny, only a couple of chairs and it was baking hot in there. The staff in this office is rude and also gave me the wrong pre-visit instructions for an ultrasound. When I arrived for the ultrasound there was no one even in the office. Only a couple waiting with me. I asked them if anyone had been there and they said no, that she left to go across the parking lot to their main location.   Oh and the walls in the patient rooms are very thin. I could hear what the patient and doctor were talking about in the room next to me. This is an invasion of patient privacy.    If seeing Deandra as normal means I have to continue to be seen in this office I will happily change doctors or move to a different office all together.

My experience was better than expected being that its always packed in here. I came in shortly after the mall opened without an appointment and man was it already super busy! Thank you Apple for having like 30 people working at once. I was helped the second I walked in. My visit was because the camera on my 6+ stopped focusing after only 8 months of owning the phone. The guy was super friendly and told me to stand by to talk to someone else to make an appointment. So I did luckily only had to wait 30 minutes for that appointment. I let the guy know what was going on and he instantly said they would replace the camera which was free because of the warranty. Glad because I believe it saved me around $60-70. Was told to take my case off and come back in 45 minutes. So I did and it was all pretty and new again!!!  Only thing that really annoyed me was as I was talking to the guy about my phone a man was standing next to me because he too was having something fixed. And apparently because he wasn't being helped at that exact moment he decided to chime in after every question the Apple guy asked me about my phone. Like I said "It doesn't back up I'm not sure why" he responds "hah like it just doesn't back itself up"...... uh yea bro that's what I said. Then I told him "I'm not sure how to use iCloud or where it all goes"   so he makes a comment about me not knowing how to use iCloud! ALRIGHT DUDE, A & B CONVERSATION, C YOUR WAY OUT. Lol! Could even tell the apple guy was like alright guy, shut up!   Overall good experience, just hope I don't have to come back. Never had any issues with my Apple products before!

This place is awesome! I had never been but stopped by after needing scrubs for school. The girl working was very helpful and offered to clear my hands and start me a fitting room right away. They have great prices and everything was easy to find. Was also very excited when she told me $14.99 and $9.99 items were 50% off that day! I bought 4 scrub tops and two bottoms for only $40!  I asked for business cards and received a calendar that let's me know what deals they have on each day.  I would definitely recommend them and already have to my classmates.

This Nello's is ok. I do however like the one on Alma School and Guadalupe much more. The service is fine. I have been twice to this location and I order the buffalo chicken pizza every time I come to Nello's. Usually it's really good when at the Alma School location. This pizza is actually the reason I come here to eat. However, this location does not make it right. There is just something so weird tasting about it. The first time I had come and ordered it I thought it was because it was under cooked but my second visit reassured they just don't make it the same between the two locations. Also annoyed me that I asked for a ranch to go and they just gave me a lid for the ranch I already used even though I had half a pizza left?

I love this place!  Seriously, where can you get this amount of food for the price? I suggest getting the small bowl because the big one is enough for 3 people to eat if you pack it in right!   I was bummed though that their ice cream machine wasn't working. Their register too was messed up so they told me to check my bank account. I was only charged once but they should get it fixed!

Don't understand the discrimination review. I'm 23 years old and covered in tattoos, someone easily discriminated against, however the staff was really helpful and sweet.   Love hallmark for small gifts. Stopped in for a few small things for my mom for her birthday. They have these funny little plush dolls called "dammit dolls". I want to go back for a few more, they're good little gag gift.   Wish their sister store in chandler mall didn't close down.

I hate that this is the closest Walgreens to me. The Walgreens I lived by before was SO MUCH better than this one. The staff were alert and quick and offered great customer service. This location lacks severely on customer service and a little bit of urgency when ringing up a customer.   The last time I was in here was for allergy medicine. All of their allergy medicine was on sale. So I chose the 5 pill packs that were marked 2 for $8. Took them up to check out and they rang in at $12 EACH. I told the Asian looking older woman what the sale sticker said and she literally just said "no, other customers had the same problem" ........ Ok? Well if your merchandise if marked wrong you think you would fix it. So I went to the back of the store to check they price, the fully stocked shelf clearly said 2 for $8 but had the wrong merchandise under that tag. I'm sorry but I do believe that you should honor the pricing because your staff placed it and LEFT IT EVEN AFTER KNOWING.  Already being annoyed I returned and told her it's fine I don't want them. She literally just stared at me and said "you pay now". No..........Take them off. She couldn't comprehend that I didn't want to buy them if they were marked at $8 but rang in as $24. Yea no thanks. Might I mention this woman is SO SLOW. I questioned if she even knew what she was doing.   Needless to say I left pretty angry. Not a way to treat a customer especially after they say they don't want the item and you basically insist they pay for it. And honestly I'm not ever in the biggest rush but I do have places to be other than Walgreens. But come on!!!    Came back in today and she literally is snailing along ringing up the woman in front of me holding a conversation after the woman was done paying. Started to ring me up when I couldn't even get to the pin pad because she was still talking to someone else. The cosmetic lady yells over from their huge enter and exit barrier that she can ring me up. I said no I'll wait here because I wasn't interested in walking all the way around then over to the cosmetic counter when I could almost be done at the current register. This layout is horribly inconvenient. I've never been to a Walgreens where they block off the doors and make you only exit out of one. Even after I said no I'll wait here the woman at the register tells me to go be helped by the cosmetic woman. What about NO do you not understand?  PLEASE get some staff who are more alert and interested in getting someone checked out and out the door. I've never had experienced a Walgreens like this.

SERIOUSLY SOMEONE PLEASE get that woman Aida off the front register. This woman is RUDE and lacks even the smallest bit of customer service. Every single time I come in she is here and I almost want to walk out and leave just to not have to deal with her.   She will not smile. She will not say hi. She won't say have a good day. She doesn't tell you your total. She literally just gives you the nastiest I hate my fucking job face the entire time you're in her presence. She throws all your purchases in a single bag and I mean throws. She does not PLACE them in the bag. So don't buy anything that can be smushed or broken because she doesn't care.   She literally threw my basket after she took it off the counter. Like wtf? I would gladly put it back just to not here an empty plastic basket smash onto the hard floor because you threw it all pissy.    Seriously who the hell is paying this lady.

This Walmart is scum. I mean you can't really expect too much from Walmart but come on!!  It's very dingy in here and the layout is completely different than other Walmart's other than the grocery side which still has weird placement for most things.   The people shopping here are bizarre and mostly all drug addicts.   As for the workers, the greeters are nice. The cashiers are worthless. I always use the self check out to avoid their workers.   The other day when I was there I was checking out and the self check out wasn't reading the weight correctly. The machine kept saying remove items. It went off and stayed stuck like that multiple times and the worker of course just stood there and watched. Finally it did it again and she just stood behind me and started laughing..... Wtf? I turned around and looked at her. What the hell is so funny? You can't do your job? I literally threw my bag into the cart and the scanner finally shut up.  She would have had no idea if I actually put an extra item in my bag because she just stood their being completely worthless and proceeded to laugh.   I feel like I'm in a foreign country walking in here.

About two weeks ago I was rear-ended by a truck. I have never been in a car accident before. Initially it was a big shock, for two days I had a constant headache. For me headaches are extremely rare so I knew something was not right considering my upper back and neck were in pain as well.   I was referred to American Chiropractic and I am so happy I decided to go to them. I have never met a team of people who are so kind and personable! I knew initially from my first phone call that I was in good hands.   My first visit I was a tad nervous being that I have never been to a chiropractor before but they really put me at ease. After x-rays and examination, my pains were proven by their findings and they set up a treatment plan for me. I will now be visiting a few times a week until February to get all back to "normal".  Being that I wasn't expecting to be in a car accident (who really is) such a long treatment plan kind of sucks for me. Had I been scheduled to visit weekly to an office with staff who are less than desirable the process would be miserable. I feel so lucky that I wound up here and I have a good feeling my visits will fly by.   The staff is incredibly friendly and professional. They work with you side by side at each day and treat you as more than just another patient. I usually show up 15 mins early for my appointments and they take me right back. They are quick and very knowledgeable. The office is also updated and clean which I appreciate.   I would definitely recommend them to anyone!!!

I heard about this place a few months ago on the radio while at work. So i decided to pay a visit. It was pretty easy to find the CD's i wanted, a few they didn't have but i was super happy about the ones they did have! They have a bunch of funny/unique toys, accessories. The employees are friendly and fun to talk to. And everything is super cheap! Best part about this place. I could go to Best Buy and spend $20 on a new CD, or come here and spend $25 on 6 used but not damaged CD's. This place is awesome and I'd recommend it to anyone.

We were told the wait would be 20 minutes and ended up being an hour. I think they under estimate wait times that's for sure. When we were finally seated it was in two separate booths which made it impossible to talk to each other.  Slow to get our drinks but once we finally ordered our food came out quick.    Bathrooms were dirty and outdated.

For the price, I do not know if it is worth it, not much to see inside. We arrived right after they opened and waited in line for probably 15-20 mins.  When we left the line was seriously over 100 people and almost stretched all the way to the casino carpet!! Those people probably waited over an hour for a 20 minute long overpriced exhibit. If you really want to take your family, arrive right when they open! It is no way worth waiting in a line like that.   The pricing of items in the gift shop surprised me though they are fairly priced. The photos however are a rip off unless you purchase them in a package with a ticket.

It has definitely been awhile since I have been here and boy has it changed!  I remember it being packed, people everywhere, all the rides well-kept and fun, the food was relatively good for a buffet, not so much this time. I would say it's been a few years since I have been here, its run down now. Probably comparable to how Jeepers went downhill quickly.   The eating areas seemed dirty. The food was not good, and I mean I wouldn't think it would really be amazing since it's a game place with a  buffet, but no its pretty bad, not to mention it was all cold. I remember it being fine, not so much now. They really don't have much of a selection either, seems now there is more salad bar than anything else.   As for the games, they have a decent selection. Most games do seem overpriced. I'm wondering if the price of their games has something to do with the lack of business considering it was a Friday night and practically dead in there.   The rides are old and in need of an update, and the young employees running them look miserable.  This place really needs an update to keep it comparable to competitors and to keep customers coming back.  As for me, I will not be coming back even if invited like I was this time. This place is NO GOOD.   Save your money and go to Peter Piper, where games are .25-.50 and the pizza is actually good.  Plus that way you won't have to pay an admission when you don't even want to eat or play in the first place. The only reason I found out the food sucked it because I was forced to pay $12 to enter and figured might as well get something for my money.

Eh. The idea is cool but unfortunately this place doesn't meet me expectations.  The seats in the theaters with recliners are awesome! Tons of space and the chairs are comfortable. The service was fast and the employees are very nice.  The last time I went, we were in one of the larger theaters due to the moving being a new release. The service was still fast but these seats are so crammed together. They do not recline and your knees are maybe a few inches from touching the seat in front of you. They are still the cushion type seats but are not comfortable due to how close they all are.  As for the food, falls flat and it's overpriced. I would compare it to the microwaved food from Applebee's, but honestly, it is worse. No flavor and cold. I would guess the tickets to be the same as a regular theater due to the price of the food but the tickets are also more expensive. I know there are plenty of other theaters in the valley with big comfy reclining chairs and the ticket prices are normal.    My last visit the movie was at 10:30, we arrived very early and waited. It took them over 45 minutes to clean the theater and we were not allowed to enter until 10:30, the start time of the movie. This was an inconvenience because they started it up right away giving no one time to really get settled after waiting for the staff forever. I've never had this happen before. I've always been able to enter a theater at least 15 minutes before the previews to get settled in. Maybe they need more staff for cleaning the larger theaters when there are new releases.  ...... And to be honest eating mediocre food in the dark that I can't first see scares me a little.

Good and bad. My favorite Forever 21 for shopping and accessories but the employees at this one suck. It's impossible to find someone to help you because they're all walking around with their nose in the air. Trying on is always a nightmare with a huge line. They won't let you bring and friend back to wait so you can show them your try ons and help choose. Oh, and its hard to forget that the fitting room walls are covered in boogers and smeared makeup.   Needs friendlier staff and a good cleaning.

Let's start with the cashier, don't call me Hun and sweetheart when I'm just trying to buy gas.    2nd, on a Saturday night, how about more than one worker. Having to stand in line behind 10 people buying crap is ridiculous when I just need gas on number 12.    More staff please.

For Vernice is at the fuel center:  I came to the Fry's on Country Club and Baseline in Mesa, yesterday 1/27 to fill my tank and use my fuel points after I just got my car back from 3 weeks of repair due to a rear-end accident. I swiped my card and added the .20 cents off a gallon and started to pump my gas. Immediate the gas started pouring out of my car all over the ground, twice. I came to the cashier to ask for her to refund my .20 cents to my card, which she was unable to do so she gave me a slip with a number to call to have it refunded, as I did not get any gas into my tank. I called the car place which had been repairing my car for the past 3 weeks, because its 30 miles away I couldn't just bring my car in so I was advised to try pumping the gas again but very slowly. I have never had an issue before pumping gas into my car as it is new. Flustered, I started crying out of frustration and embarrassment. Because I needed to try and get gas again and was afraid of making a mess I came back to the cashier and let her know I was going to try pumping it again. She immediately said not to worry and that she would come out and help me, which she didn't have to do.  I felt so bad that I made a mess of gas all over the ground, but instead of being frustrated at my mess she was so willing to come out and help me. She gave me a hug because she had seen me crying and she stood there and slowly pumped the gas in my tank so it would not over flow. The fact that she was willing to step away for a second to help me when she wasn't required to meant a lot. I'm very thankful for her help.  Seriously in the world today there needs to be more people like her. Its pretty rare now that I find someone with customer service like hers.  Thank you Vernice!

The driver of this tow truck was getting on the freeway and almost clipped the front of my car. My fiancé had to slam on the breaks while we had our 2 year old in the back seat and I am pregnant. If he would have hit our civic on the passenger side he would have possibly killed me and my unborn child. The negligence of this driver is amazing.   After making some weird motions with his arms at us  he continued on and dangerously cut off another vehicle!!!   You or your drivers need a lesson in driving and sharing the road!!!!

My 2nd family and I LOVE Peter Piper. By far our favorite pizza.    It used to be tradition that every Friday we all met up at the Mesa Riverview Peter Piper. It seems after the remodel of that one it was a lot nicer, however it's so insanely busy that we stopped going. This Chandler location is much more desirable. The staff is nice, its clean, and the food is mad quickly. The game area is easy to make your way around because it's not as packed at the other location.  The BEST pizza.

Seriously AWESOME!  This is my kind of place. You can shit talk and be shit talked. The embarrassing hats they put on are hilarious and the birthday dance is even better.  If you cant take a joke and are easily offended I would recommend eating somewhere else.   The slushy bar outside it great. I seriously hope they open a place like this in Arizona because I would visit all the time.   Can rate much on the food because all I had were fried pickles. They were good along with my drinks. I will for sure be back next Vegas visit!

2 stars because I like the convenience of having a self check out.   1 star for the dirty dressing rooms. Generally you need to take your shoes off when trying on clothes. The floor is nasty covered in clumps of dust and the walls have bloody looking smears.   And I purchased a portable charger. Get home and open it to find out it was already opened and someone stole the charger out of the box. So now it's literally useless. Will be returning it.

Ok I get it. Ross probably isn't the most desirable job in the world.   Well first off it's a complete disaster in here, but that's typical of Ross.  My annoyance is at the cashier. Didn't get his name, 30 something year old short male working at 7:30 on Feb 26. Not that anyone will look him up.   Anyways, rings me up. I grab my single bag off the counter because he couldn't hand it to me. The receipt prints on his receipt printer on HIS side of the counter facing HIM. And he literally just looks at me and says "there's your receipt". I sorry but I'm pretty sure you are able bodied enough to hand me at least my receipt, when hand me my single bag was too much for you.     It really doesn't take much effort to pick a piece of paper off your printer and hand it to a customer. You made me reach over and rip it off.    I can guarantee this guy is one of the people that thinks $15 should be the minimum wage.   Well guy, you suck.

It's sad to admit but I'm a Dunkin Donuts regular, and considering I order the same thing at least 3 times a week I think I know what my coffee should taste like. The girls who work here are rude. I've only once sent my coffee back because it tasted like water. After telling the girl it didn't taste right she acted like she didn't understand or wasn't willing to make me a new one. So I tell her it tastes watered down, and since she wouldn't make a new one (every other dunkin has always made a new one) I asked her to add more chocolate. She walks over to another employee and so rudely says "it tastes like water!", basically making fun of me to the other girl.  I received my coffee and left only to be unsatisfied for what I paid for. Ever since when I return I always get a nice girl talking through the intercom but once I pull up to the window get treated with a snotty personality. Seems like they might need some male staff or a new manager.   I would suggest trying another Dunkin if you want good coffee and pleasant service.

Geidi is incredibly rude.   Was just in looking for my size in pants and bending down looking through the sizes. There was a rack of hanging jeans directly next to me. As she stood there talking loudly to another coworker about something not related to her job apparently she ran out of patience with me bending over looking. So instead of waiting to put back go back jeans, she squeezes in the tiny 2 foot space and smacks me in the head with jeans as she tried to smash them back into the rack.    Like how rude are you? You couldn't wait 20 seconds for me to stand up and move so you just try to squeeze between me and another rack?   Nice customer service you snot.

Best part about Dos is it's cheap.   Want to get drunk, have a good time, and not have to worry about prissy people? Dos is your place.  Service always seems ok, I never really have to hunt anyone down for a drink if I'm sitting at a table. I usually get the nachos with beef, they are awesome!! The mini chimis are good too but definitely try the nachos.  By far the best place to sit back and people watch. It's like a super entertaining zoo there.   Dos will always have a place in my heart and it's definitely my go-to bar.

We were quickly seated. Unsure what to order we looked over the menu, and the menu flyer that was advertising some type of meal and desert deal on Wednesdays. While looking at what to order and comparing pricing with that advertised deal I believe our waitress came over maybe 5 or 6 times asking if we were ready to order. I swear this was in maybe a 15-minute period. She was nice but this was annoying. When I put down my menu that's a good sign I'm ready to order, but I was still looking at it.....   My steak was good, not completely well done but not enough to complain over. My drink was great but I ordered both sides broccoli, half was cooked to my liking, the other half was not.

PLEASE STOP MAKING ICE COFFEE WITH HOT COFFEE!!!!!   Half the time I come here my coffee taste like shit and I throw it away after two sips.  It's obvious the coffee most times doesn't have enough time to cool before its used in ice coffees. Hot makes ice melt, if not already obvious. So when you make peoples coffees with HOT COFFEE in ice it taste like water with a splash of coffee and it's disgusting. I can tell just by the watered down color of the coffee when you hand it to me. Usually I try to taste it first to have it remade but sometimes I don't have time when everything is handed to me at once and people are waiting behind me.  Last time I asked my coffee to be remade. You know what the chick did when she remade it? PUT COCONUT IN IT. And what happens when you're being a bitch and putting a random flavor in someone's coffee and that random flavor IS SOMETHING THEY ARE ALLERGIC TO?   Idiots. Do your job, it's not that hard and when a customer complains about something they paid for tasting like shit, REMAKE IT RIGHT. Don't be spiteful and mix random shit in it, especially something someone can so easily have an allergy to.   So again today, I will be throwing away the coffee I paid for. Thank you 5:30 AM workers.

TJ Maxx, I love you.  The amount of visits I make here is disgusting. Honestly, I think I need to seek help to save my wallet from another beating.  But honestly what's not to love about this location! I always walk out with something I love!  It's mine and my best friends go to place to discuss how CUTE everything is and buy things we don't actually need.

First time I've had Cold Stone in probably 8-9 years. We didn't know what to order when walking in so we decided to stand and look at the board in front and behind us. The guy working told us to step up so he could take our order, well we weren't ready. So, we stood trying to make a decision and he had to repeat himself, again. Yes we get it worker, when we are ready we will step up and you will take our order. WE ARE NOT READY! I wanted to yell at him. Pretty annoying and the customer in front of me was a total weirdo. We just wanted our ice cream so we could leave.   The ice cream was good, but very messy.

E, Cruz as it states on my receipt needs to get off his phone while ringing someone up. Not texting, literally talking to someone on the phone. How disrespectful and unprofessional. Not to mention it took longer than it should have for him to get behind the counter to ring me up for gas. Only to practically look at me like, "uh what do you need".   I'm pretty sure this is a gas station and that was the register. I probably need some damn gas because your pump won't allow a PIN number for debit.    Idiot.

The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because their pizza is my favorite.  My 2nd family and I used to have a tradition of coming to this location every Friday. Service was always good and they always remembered us well. It was always a little busy and messy from leftover food but we would just request someone come and clean a table for us.  It seems ever since this location was remodel it's gotten out of control. This place is PACKED. It literally is so bad you cannot even walk to refill a drink without being trampled or almost knocking over or stepping on someone's child. It probably has to do a lot with this side of town but the customers are ghetto. I probably would not recommend bringing small children here because they will most likely be trampled or assaulted by another child. There is even a police officer on duty inside. I am going to guess it has a lot to do with people not watching their kids and the potential for someone to easily take someone's child.   Because it is so packed the food is slow, and if you actually find an open table it's most likely still covered in trash. I would suggest saving your night by being ruined by other people's children and visit another location. It's not really possible to enjoy yourself with the amount of people packed in this building.

The guy working the drive thru here is awesome! How could you be having a bad day having this guy talking to you all goofy.   His name is Woody!!! Woody is awesome! Best customer service I've had out of all the Dunkins I have been to across the valley.

This subway sucks. Its pretty clean and all but the girl who always ends up making my sub does a horrible job. Sometime i wonder how hard it can honestly be to make a tuna sub, but for some reason she appears to have a difficult time. The first time i went i just let her do her thing, but after getting home and eating my sub must of the bites were sauce, veggies and bread, no tuna. Every other subway i go to spreads the tuna with a knife just like they do with everything else but i guess not this one. So the last few times i went in i specifically asked her to spread it with a knife, she said okay and looked for one. After looking for 3 seconds and not finding one she just continued to make my sub with 3 big globs of tuna. Might sound ridiculous but its not that hard to find a knife and do your job the right way.

Purchased a drink for $17 after tax. I can tell the drink would have been good but the cup being new and not rinsed out made the drink taste like straight up plastic. I opened it and smelled it and it was the smell of plastic and tasted the exact same. At first I thought the machine must have had cleaning chemicals left in it. The cups need to be rinsed prior. Was disgusting and a waste of $17 plus tip.

Came here for the fight.   Was extremely packed but even though it was so full that people were standing our service was still quick and attentive. I didn't eat this time but I do love their wing strips.  Wasn't happy that the girls taking cover charges were literally less than a foot behind my chair and bumping into me the whole time and being extra annoying, they were not very professional!

Nothing bad to say. I've only gone to one other place where I was cut and had yellow nails, I figured all nail salons would be similar. Not XO! I always leave with exactly what I wanted and the staff is all very friendly. They also offer a punch card which is very convenient if you come frequently. I would recommend them to anyone.

First time ever getting my car washed her. Apparently I didn't pay attention very well to the signs because I just wanted the bug explosion on the side of my car cleaned off. I pulled up wondering where the machine was to pay like most quick car washes. A guy came up and actually took my payment which was a little surprising.  Was expecting the big machines that come down and scrub and spray soap all over my car. Nope, it's a team of guys doing it! It's actually kind of funny, you feel really awkward that they're scrubbing your car while you're in it. Honestly I wanted to laugh and smile so just kept my phone in hand. At the end they even dry it off and scrub your wheels.  I feel guilty that I didn't have any cash to tip but now know next time to have some on me! They were all really kind. And I do think it's pretty awesome that this company employs actual people when they could just have the same machine every other car wash has.  I'll be back!

I've been shopping this TJ Maxx and Homegoods for years! I love it! It's always been very organized and clean.  One thing I also like is the employees are there working but not chasing you down asking if you need help constantly. That is something that drives me nuts. Seems like they are always out restocking and adding new merchandise.  It's very rare that I come and leave with nothing.   I do wish they had more Homegoods stores in the valley.   By far one of my favorite stores!

Alex was awesome! I've never been on my own phone plan so he was very helpful trying to figure it out. There was a bit of a struggle getting my number pulled from Verizon but he was patient and didn't give up trying. I expected to come in and either leave with nothing or spend a few hundred $ out of pocket. He set me up with the plan I had heard of from a friend. Price is very reasonable and I got the new iPhone 6+ without having to pay out of pocket for the phone. Very satisfied with the great customer service and knowledgeable staff.

I don't think I've had a more annoying delivery order. Took 50 mins and multiple calls to get my sandwich. I even asked to come pick it up but it was already on the way. I tipped the guy still even though I wanted to give 0 only because he was nice and I felt guilty. My sandwich isn't even what I ordered and even paid extra for different meat. Freaky fast delivery? How about order some more staff!   I called to let her know it was wrong after the long wait and she said they would send me the correct sandwich. No one delivered the right sandwich.

We love TOGO's. There is never anyone in here when we come, so I'm not really sure how this place stays open. It's in the strangest complex and honestly I would have never even known about it had my friend not told me. They should relocate this place to a good corner for sure!  We always come for their special on Saturdays. I really like their bread, it's actually a thick decent size bread. Nothing compared to the nasty flat bread at subway. They do not skimp on the toppings either. Warning though, if you ask for extra mayo/mustard, wait for them to apply it first then decide if it's enough. They will literally drown your sandwich in it..... like A LOT.   My only negative so far is that I placed and order online to be ready at 3. My boyfriend went to pick it up and it wasn't ready. They made him wait awhile for the person with a large order in front of him only to find out they never even made our order. I thought that the point of ordering ahead was to have the sub ready to pick up when you arrive. It took them some searching to even figure out what I had ordered online. This was a little disappointing, and this was the only time my sub was also really sloppy like it was all just smacked in there quickly. I would think after the miscommunication with the order they would offer some type of coupon for a returning visit, but nothing.

First time here. I enjoyed my dinner a lot! Ordered the Alfredo Supremo with chicken. I ate the whole dish.... which was bad because it put me into a food coma.  The decor is nice and the service was great for us having a party of almost 20.   I will return.

First time in for dinner before my sisters graduation. I really enjoyed the decor. The burrito I ordered was surprisingly larger than I expected although it was pretty difficult to eat but a fork helped with that. Only complaint really is the tight space and the music was way too loud. Almost had to yell across the table. Otherwise good, I'll be back at some point to try some tacos.

Definitely the cleanest neatly organized thrift shop I've ever been too. Everything is organized nicely, a very easy shop. Found some awesome home items at a great deal!! I will be back.

I really like the couch with movable chase lounge I purchased from here almost a year ago. It has held up nicely but doesn't get much use. I can tell the cushions will really start to flatten out when it gets more use but the price could not be beat.   Walking into this place is a bit of a shocker. Its massive in there and the warehouse is even larger but it sure offers a huge selection of just about any home furniture you could need.  When I picked out my couch, it was not in stock and took about 3 weeks to get it. I do remember also not receiving a call by the date I was told it would be in. I had to call myself to confirm and it had already been there waiting for me but no one let me know. The process of picking up the couch was easy and they loaded it and strapped it down for me.  I hope to come back soon and purchase a rug and most likely the matching chair to my couch. I was impressed by the amount of help there was from sale associates on the floor. I do however hope that the next item I purchase is in stock.

Everyone hates me for this.... Buttttttt I don't really like this place.  I mean it is a cool environment, the service is good and everyone is nice. However the food is not good at all, and I don't drink beer. So I can't really rate based off the beer. However, I have not ordered food since trying it because I was that unimpressed and they don't really have many options.  Also the last time I went the bathroom was pretty gross. I would expect them to be a little more updated and definitely cleaner. Seemed weird that the whole bin of cleaning products just sits on the floor in there under the sink. And the sink looks nasty.

This place makes me laugh.  They have some very cheap clothes and you definitely get what you pay for. They have two locations now in Chandler mall. One location is in place of Love Culture and the other took the location where Wet Seal was.   Being that they are the same store, in the same mall, they are pretty different. The clothes seem the same however the customer service is different. Both stores lack in customer service but the downstairs location is horrible. Everything is up high and if you need to get something down good luck finding someone to help you besides whoever is behind the counter tagging merchandise.    What is funny to me is the downstairs locations music. It is music singing about Jesus on repeat. Talking about "Callllll outttt to Jesus!!! If you need to know Jessssussss is the answer because he is Jeeeesusssss". Literally, I had fun coming up with lyrics to the songs as the continued and honestly, I was pretty accurate with which lyrics would follow next. This seems a little odd, and it's definitely annoying to shop to. They are selling trendy clothes, put on the radio I can guarantee you would get customer to shop for a few more minutes. The music drives me insane.   Even funnier is going from the downstairs location to the upstairs the music goes from only talking about Jesus, to talking about bump and grind, and ass and titties. Probably should find a happy medium between the two, just sayin.

For being a quick drive thru car wash this place is great! I always pick a cheaper wash because I don't like that the tire shine leaves stain marks on the plastic parts of my car. However, even their cheaper washes are great and seem to get off all the gunk I'd really have to scrub at.   The best part are the FREE vacuums! The free vacuums are actually the reason I drive out of my way to come to this carwash. And its great, I don't have to deal with anyone.  The only negative I have found at the vacuums is they seem to lose a lot of suction when someone is using the one directly next to yours. I've only ever noticed this once since there is usually enough space to have no one next to you.

Updating my review as of today.    Never really had an issue coming here until today. I only get the $6 wash because the tire shine on the upgraded wash stains the plastic on my car.   Today the wash hardly dried my car?? This has never happened. Usually there's a few drips from under my mirrors or license plate which is normal. Not this time. Was soaked on the left side. When I got out I took photos to post on Yelp and the guys asked if there was a problem. I said yes... It's not dry. So he said to run it through again.   Second time... Still just as wet. I literally dried my car off with a blanket I had in my trunk.   I get a $6 wash isn't going to be amazing, buts it's always done the job until now. Never had issues with my car being dry before? It's like it pushes your through the dryer way too fast or one isn't working?

Anything and everything, they've got it!!   Plan at least an hour in here. You'll need it to attempt to hit all the aisles.   Super random but I love their shopping carts.    Downside, the bathrooms are nasty. But this mall is also super hood so I guess I can't really expect better than a porta-potty type cleanliness.

My first time trying Smash Burger. I don't think this was really the greatest first experience.   A coworker and I ordered online to pick up our food at 12 on lunch to avoid a long line. I was told the time waiting in line here and waiting for food was way too long for fast food. That was confirmed while waiting on our "to go" food. I was observing the regular line.   We ordered our food to be ready for pick up at 12. We got there about 12:02. We stood under the sign that said to go online order pick up. The girl working the food counter noticed us but seemed to purposely not turn around to ask if we needed help for a good 5 minutes. We had to ask another person waiting if we were in the right spot.   Finally she turned around and asked if we had a 'to go' order. She said back my coworkers name, as if she already knew that's why we had been waiting. Mine was a separate order. His was not bagged to go, it was sitting under the warming light things in a tray to eat in the restaurant. The worker requested them to bag it to go, which took about another 5 minutes.   The waiting was really awkward. They seemed to not have enough people working for a lunch time rush. The customers waiting in the regular line backed up to the door didn't seem to be moving.   I thought it was rude that it seemed as though she purposely ignored us. We were in the right area too. She didn't even seem to be doing much but waiting? It was really odd.   I give two stars because although my food was cold and I could tell it was made way prior to 12 when I requested, I can tell the food would have been good had it been warm or didn't taste as if it had been siting around for awhile.   Maybe it was an off day but the experience wasn't a good first impression at all.

I have literally been coming here ever since I have had teeth! Dr. Kohler has always been fantastic!! The way they renovated is beautiful; it looks like an upscale office. Have always had a great experience. They really remember their patients and make you feel right at home. I also enjoy the newer young girl at the front desk, she's super nice and really chipper. Definitely a good way to start your visit if you're one of those people who hates going to the dentist.

I've grown sick of this Dunkin, the staff used to be awesome. I came literally every day and even knew them by name. Now it's all new people who are rude and treat customers like a quick number. After coming here for years and getting the same coffee I understand exactly what it should taste like. It seems as though EVERY time I come now my coffee taste horrible, completely watered down. I'm not sure if they're using too hot of coffee for iced coffees or if they have no idea how to make a simple iced with mocha cream and sugar. Wish they would get their old staff back or at least teach the new staff how to correctly make simple coffee. Maybe have a training where they taste test or something! Very disappointed. Their coffee should go back to .99 because it's maybe only worth that much. And if someone brings back in a coffee to be remade a nicer attitude would be great. I'm also never the person to return something I normally just suck it up or throw it out but I'm sick of wasting money hoping it will be good the next time.

The atmosphere and décor are really nice and make for a fun place to eat.  I got the tacos; I never order tacos from anywhere. Felt like they were missing something, like a little spice, but were overall good. Also the brownie with ice cream was bomb!  Our server was very nice and quick to serve out table of 5, + 2 kids. Even better is the fact that they have groupons, which we used.  I will most likely be back and plan to try something different.

Sherry and Judy were fantastic. They deserve every tip they get. For such a busy place with people in and out I wouldn't expect even mediocre service at best. They were very kind and attentive. Judy even specifically asked for them to bring out the sprinkles and brought them all the way to our table for my god daughters ice cream just to make her happy despite us even requesting them.    The food is just regular buffet food. Nothing amazing however their dessert bar has some good options. I wish we had come for dinner and not brunch but for the money probably won't eat there again. I'm not huge on buffets but it was easy. I wish they would have had pastas and what not but assuming they were lacking due to it being brunch.   The stars are for Sherry and Judy.

My visits here have been great. Heather is very knowledgeable and professional.  I like this new location, the front room is very spacious and they have a good selection of glasses. Unfortunately, for me this time my prescription changed so I have to get another pair of frames. I have a wide face so finding frames that I like that also fit my face is somewhat difficult. Bradley is great at helping out; he has a good eye and really listens to what you like. This time I was set on getting a pair of D&G frames. They do have a few in their selection but none that looked good on me. Luckily, he suggested that they could order me a few pairs to try on that are the same size as my current glasses. I'm really happy this was an option since I was so set on a specific pair that they didn't have.  Oh and it happened to be a theme day for them on the day of my visit, I believe 80's theme (so funny). It was a shock seeing Heather walk in all dressed up and Bradley in tiny work out shorts. I appreciate that the staff here is so personable and it was definitely a good laugh.  I am unsure of the name of the younger girl who got me signed in and took me back to do a few tests originally. She is also great!

This place deserves 0 stars. I'm incredibly surprised that based off the reviews nothing has been done about this establishment. I came in with my friend and stood at the front counter waiting to be seated for 10 minutes. I could understand this kind of wait if they were busy, but it was silent and all we could hear standing there was the obnoxious chiming bell in the back notifying the employees that customers came in side. Even after hearing the bell repeatedly no one came to seat us. Finally a employee comes strolling out of the bathroom and her response is "oh, no one seated you"? Finally she walks us to our seat and hands us menus telling us our waiter will be with us soon. So we sat for a few more minutes  and heard a few employees talking about customers behind us. Our waiter finally appears walks by our table shrugs and says "ehh I'll get them in minute". We instantly decided to leave because it was apparent this restaurant didn't want our money. As we got in the car I looked in side to see 3 employees at the front counter all smiling and talking about the fact that we left.   Drove a few miles down to the IHOP on power where we were seated right away and had great customer service. Our waiter here was actually professional. Even watched him help an elderly woman out side.
