Hands down the best flour tortillas I have ever had. I had a carne asada burrito and I couldn't tell you what the meat tasted like because all I can remember is that tortilla. It was soft, thick and flavorful, it definitely made the burrito.

The ONLY place I will get my haircut.   First, I have been going here every 2-3 weeks for 4 years and have never seen a "list" (as one reviewer said there was). It's a place for gentlemen (hence, the name), and since I've been going there, it has been on each other's word who is next in line. Me, personally, I wait for my favorite barber if I can, but I'm not rude and will take the next barber if no one is waiting.  OK, to the barbershop: This is where a man goes to get his haircut. Nice comfy seats, private flat screen at each station, barbers in uniform, straight razor with hot cream finishes. Sure, you may have to wait 30-60 minutes, but there are complimentary soft drinks, water and coffee. They are always friendly and they are good to their regulars.   I have waited so long to post my review because it's been my little secret and I only tell my buddies that I like to go there (and they are all hooked, too). But, after seeing negative reviews, I couldn't bite my tongue anymore. You're going to spend more money than at a Super-Cuts, but you will get the clean, fresh satisfaction of a professional haircut. Professional appearance is important for my career and I don't risk that on cheap haircuts.

Total waste of time and money! My wife and I were celebrating my new promotion, but unfortunately our favorite sushi joint, Sakana Sushi on Elliot, was closed for remodeling. A woman who had also shown up said that Sushi Eye on Warner was good and so we thought we would give it a try. First impression was the place was nice: very cool, hip decor, nice house/chill music, very trendy. The menu looked great, nice photos of very lavish sushi, and priced relatively high, so we assumed we were in for some good sushi (with a 4-star rating and the prices). Then, it was all down hill... I ordered a Combo and my wife ordered some Gyoza and a roll, eel sauce on the side (please!). Gyoza came out, no plates. We waited several minutes for our plates then just decided to dig in. She came back for refills, no plates. Not that big of a deal, but... My wife's roll comes out (Golden Cali Roll) and it is extremely "fishy" tasting. I say "fishy" because, yes, I know it's fish, but it's imitation crab and that's about it, shouldn't taste like a medley of fish. My salad (below average) and soup (PIPING HOT) comes out. I decided to let the soup cool a bit, as I went back to it, my combo came out. Still, I'm not annoyed yet, but, this was a little annoying. (Still no eel sauce). I got into the Cali Roll, it was good, teriyaki chicken, good, rice was a bit dry and tasteless, then teriyaki beef... COLD! My soup was still too hot to sip, my beef was cold to the touch. I am not one to send things back, but I said to our waitress "I am very sorry, but this beef is cold." She was apologetic and took the whole plate back, which I was OK with considering I still had some hot soup, brought my plate back minus the beef and said there was a fresh serving coming. (No eel sauce...) Then, my wife decided to venture into my combo plate, took a Cali Roll and to her surprise, there was wasabi in the rice (she is not a fan). As we looked over at the sushi bar to see if we could figure out the deal, we saw our waitress in the sushi prep area (oddly) waving around money. WTF?! Dirty money around raw fish, nice! Then, we noticed, there was no manager in/around the restaurant. This place was smoke and mirrors. It looked trendy and hip, but the food was terrible, definitely not even close to what we paid. My beef came out, hot, which was nice, but it was rubbery. At this point, I was pretty much done, as was my wife. Well, at least I had a new promotion to be happy about, but dinner left us with a bitter end to the day. I would suggest you not eat here, unless you go for 1/2 price happy hour, then it MIGHT be worth it. Venture up Elliot to Sakana and have a quality meal for a better price.

I was a bit creeped out the first time I ate here. I took my wife's younger brothers because they had seen it on the Travel Channel, so I thought I'd try it out. Being a large man, I got to eat for free (score!), but only had one single and some fries, but enjoyed watching my teenage brother-in-laws try to finish their doubles (haha). I've been back several times with mixed experiences. It really depends on your nurse: sometimes you get a nurse who is very talkative and makes sure your order comes out real fast and hot, and sometimes you get a nurse who is watching the clock. It's not the best hamburger I've ever had, but I enjoy the do-it-yourself condiments (jalapeno and mustard for me), and the fact that you know you are going to get CHEESE and BEEF, and in good portions. The fries are tasty, but inconsistent. Sometimes they're crispy and tasty, sometimes they're flat and soggy. I guess they could work on consistency.

When my wife and I first moved to Maricopa, we were disappointed that there were very few "authentic" restaurants. We saw Tacos N' More advertising they would be "opening soon" and we couldn't wait. The wait was WELL worth it. First, the food is very authentic. I lived in Mexico for a year and this what I was missing, right down to the refrescos in glass bottles and Mexican style ice cream bars. Second, their service is amazing. They are the definition of family owned and operated, and they always greet you with a smile and ask "Where have you been?" Finally, Tacos N' More is about as close as you get to home cooking because you are not limited to the menu. The fact that they have a menu is absurd because you can order any item any way you would like it. I always feel dumb asking "Can I get..." because they always answer "OF COURSE!" A must dine-in for any Maricopa resident, and a great stop if you venturing through or going to the casino.

We liked and will be back again, but we could've done without staff wearing open-toe shoes in/around the kitchen. Food was good, portions were good, staff was friendly, just need to work on being TOO casual with the attire.

I hate the dentist, let's start off with that...  In March, I woke up one morning and my face was swollen. I went to work, but I felt a fever coming on and the swelling was increasing. I called Foothill Smiles and they said they were booked. I told the receptionist what was going on and I could hear her concern over the phone. She put me on hold and came back with "Can you be here by 5:30?" Phew! Got over to them and they got me in just before they closed, so off the bat I'm impressed. During the X-Rays, I explain "Look, I know my mouth is a mess, I am terrible with my teeth. Please, I'm not interested in lots of work, I just need to get this done." They assured me they would only focus on my issue at hand and they did. The procedure was awful (the pain), but the doctor and staff were spot on. The billing person didn't rush me (even though they were staying late) and worked us through several options, didn't up-sell us on anything. I had to come back in for a root canal and bridge, so this one visit turned into 3, but they were very accomodating with my schedule, and called the day before each one to remind me (I need that, I forget everything!).   Fast forward to today... I got a call last week for my "check-up" (again, I forgot, thanks!) I went in knowing I would need more than a cleaning. On my last visit, I found out the doctor I enjoyed had left to her own practice, so today I met Dr. Hilton. So, remember, I hate the dentist, but I'm also afraid when the dentist is younger than me (makes me tremble). My first instict "Sh*t!" We go through X-Rays (with Bonnie, who was there for my extraction, she rocks!) and Dr. Hilton. The doctor points out everything going on, and he seemed to have a good grasp of what was already going on with me even though I had been there maybe 10 minutes. He pointed out several root canals, but only one he felt was urgent, and some other work (some roots that are dead... I told you, my mouth is gross!) He was upfront and said "If you have the time, let's get this done, or let's schedule it for very soon." I was concerned about finances. The finance reps (is that what they are?) came in and I was overwhelmed. Sorry, this is going to have to wait. I was bummed to not be able to afford the procedure. They came back 5 minutes later and said "Sir, we have changed our policies on in-house coverage, and you appear to be pre-approved. If you don't mind, can we go through it." I said sure, but if you've seen my mouth, you've seen my credit report. BOOM! Approved, and for more than I needed! So, let's get the work done! They get me ready for a couple hours of work (and warn me ahead of time it will take awhile). Not going to lie, and you might not believe this, but Dr. Hilton was so good at what he does that I fell asleep in the chair. No, I wasn't not given anesthesia! Once they got working on the root canal, since it seemed like a long time, I closed my eyes, and I think I startled them when I woke up snoring! LOL! I also have to point out that Dr. Hilton played assistant to his assistant, often getting his own tools and running the x-ray machine for her (that was a first for me!).   I know that when I go back for the rest of my work, I am requesting him by name. But I still hate going to the dentist... HA!

Terrible customer service. Went in one day, turned away but made an appointment for a week later. Showed up at 10:45 A.M. for an 11 A.M. appointment. All I needed was an oil change and for them to run a "Check Engine" diagnostic. They told me "45 minutes to an hour." Returned at 1:30 P.M., over 2 hours after I dropped it off and they hadn't even pulled the truck into the bay. They're response "Sorry. You can make another appointment." Are you serious????

My wife and I ate at O'Shays tonight after a long day of errands and shopping. We had eaten there before, and although we weren't super impressed, we just wanted a quick sandwich that wasn't fast food. Well, to my surprise and delight, it was All-You-Can-Eat Prime Rib night, and prime rib is part of my DNA. To make a long story short, 3 trips to the prime rib bar and I'm a happy man now. Our waitress offered us to-go refills on our drinks, how can you not smile after that? I went in for an average meal and came out feeling like we had gone out for a special occasion. I would give it 5-stars if they had a designated hostess. We always seem to be wondering if we just seat ourselves or if we should just wait.

Most Chick-Fil-A's get 5 stars. This one gets 2, deducted one star for each time my order has been wrong in the last 3 visits. First, order a sandwich and nuggets, got a sandwich and fries. Next time, ordered two spicy sandwiches, got two regular ones, also asked for mayo, got 1 packet, um.... Tonight, ordered 1 spicy, 1 regular, was told I had to pull aside and wait for the spicy (no big deal), I said "No problem, just please remember the mayo". They brought the order to me, I quickly checked to see if it wasz there (no mayo), I look up, she's gone (gee, thanks, I waited for you). Love this place, wax excited to get one on my route home, but Im not coming back to this one. Terrible management when you cant get your product out correctly.
