This place is super close to my house so I visit pretty regularly. Tommy and Nick are two of the awesome servers usually out on the patio and I always have a good time with them as my servers. Sunday nights they have  $3 you call it's which is always a blast. The food is also pretty good... my favorite are the chili cheese fries. If you're younger like me (22) you may want to stray away from Friday or Saturday nights... since most of the local Ahwatukee cougars are out on the prowl but it does make for some interesting sights if you do venture out on these nights... but I prefer to stick to the weekdays. All in all a good place to hang out, catch the game, or shoot some pool! GO!

So far I've only been to this place one time but it was pretty awesome. I had a caramel latte and it was the best latte I've ever had. This place makes their OWN CARAMEL!  Heck yeah! The coffee guy was super friendly and remembered the friend I was with and everyone else who worked there was also very friendly. Go check this place out!

My fiancé and I walked in and immediately were put off by the live music, a young girl singing and playing acoustic guitar but, despite our better judgement, decided to stick with Vintage 95 due to our lack of a back up plan. We were seated in the very back, closest to the kitchen and registers, presumably because she and I were the youngest (and most heavily tattooed) patrons in the restaurant.   We were sat directly next to a repugnant couple of 50-somethings who simply would not and could not stop groping each other. Not even reasonable PDA, like her hand under his shirt onto his nasty hairy chest.    My fiancé and I came here to celebrate my promotion at work and we were looking for good cocktails. I prefer whiskey/bourbon cocktails and their online menu looked promising, but the menu we received was incredibly limited in comparison.   The cocktails were decent enough and fairly typical. We ordered the bruschetta which was the best thing we ate, although not by much. We each ordered a flatbread; I had the italian and my fiancé had the vintage, which she felt was entirely too sweet. The sauce on my italian flatbread tasted like chef boyardee.   As the night went on the young girl's live music became more irritating and her voice more shrill. Frankly, I don't need to hear multiple Sara Barielles covers while I'm trying to enjoy my sub-par meal. To accompany the undesired entertainment, a little girl who apparently had just come from a ballet recital began dancing in the middle of the restaurant.  Our server was honestly a little below standard but she was probably the best part of our dining experience, so we weren't offended. By the end of  the night we were more than relieved to be out of Vintage 95 and will not be coming back.  If you enjoy over priced sub-par food, 50-something PDA, and 6 year olds in tutus dancing to abrasive live music then Vintage is for you.

I can't say enough about how awesome our wedding photos came out. My wife and I had a pretty unconventional wedding - and R2 handled it perfectly. We had our wedding at night outside and knew It would take some good photographers to capture our ceremony and reception and they nailed it!   We got our pictures back wicked fast and got our wedding book within two days of approving it (I actually think it came NEXT day).   Everyone was super professional, fun, and got stuff done when it needed to be. They were what you want and need on your wedding day.   So glad we went with R2 and can't recommend them enough!
