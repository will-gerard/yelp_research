The food was great, my boyfriend had the pizza and I had the steak... believe it or not, it was the best I have had in a long time! Not something I would expect for somewhere known for its pizza. Even though everything we had was delicious, the five stars are for the great customer service we received from the moment we walked in until the time that we left.

I came here for the first time earlier this week since I was in the area and read the great reviews on Yelp, and was completely disappointed. I ordered the house chicken and the flavor was too overwhelming and the veggies were soggy. I also ordered their vegetarian roll and thought it was gross - instead of putting in a ton of veggies, all it had in it was avocado, cucumber, and cream cheese.. And about 90% of the filling was cream cheese....  Cream cheese sushi = not cool.  Seriously, go somewhere else.

It only gets a star because I HAVE to leave one to be able to review this place. I saw the bad reviews and thought it might just be because it is below average but still edible for she that is rushed, nearby, and just needs to eat.  WORSE Chinese food I have had my whole life... I mean as hungry as I was I could not force myself to eat it. I ordered the house chicken and the sauce had NO flavor and was just overly salted sludge. My boyfriends Mongolian beef was also absolutely disgusting. To make matter worse, but not surprisingly, I felt sick for the rest of the day. DO NOT EAT HERE.

WORSE customer service EVER! My boyfriend and I were even staring at the girl working there wondering at which point she would smile. Everyone was just rude and the pizza was absolutely terrible. It was slimy because of the grease and the dough was undercooked. Seriously, don't waste your money.

This salon is absolutely amazing! From the moment I walked in every single employee has exceptional customer service. I went in for a haircut with Cassondra, this being my first time here. She is so incredibly sweet, helpful, attentive, and most importantly did an AMAZING job! My hair is thick, long, and can be quite difficult... and it finally falls nicely into place even when I do not add product and just let it air dry! I am never going anywhere else!

Love this place! I lived in Queen Creek for about 8 years and had never been. We had the cheese platter, panini sandwiches, salad, and gelato- everything was fresh and tasted great! The service was also very good, everyone was very kind.  Next time I go I am also going to have to take some goodies home.

Lunch Break's food is always fresh, tasty, and so far my experiences have been that they have my order ready in a timely manner. The customer service here is FANTASTIC, everyone that works here is very sweet - the kind of place that definitely develops a relationship with their regulars. I started going here because it is near my work and have found that I now crave those veggie sandwiches on the weekend which means I do my best to get my fix during the week. :)  Highly recommended!!

Last Friday was my first time airbrush tanning, and needless to say I was very nervous. First of all, my face was still a little red due to a few poor attempts of sitting out by the pool in hopes of catching a little color, though I was definitely not striving for red. Next, my skin was INCREDIBLY dry, which I know is not necessarily something ideal right before spray tanning.   Ann was absolutely phenomenal! She made sure to ask me all the right questions, and therefore was able to pick out just the right shades and drops (I added a little bronze shimmer for only $5 more) so that I would no longer look red, and had the best color ever!   My boyfriend, though he claims to love me pale or any way, definitely likes the tan... and if he approves, then I know it was a job well-done!   Book an appointment with Ann - you will NOT regret it!!

I've been wanting to come here for a while now as I have heard good things and of course the reviews on Yelp are great. Biggest disappointment ever. My fiance and I got a carne asada quesadilla, carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, and a bean burrito. They were all incredibly bland and I cannot for the life of me understand all the hype. All I can think of is that 99% of the people that go have already been drinking which of course must make the food somehow taste better than it is.

The company I work for contacted AZ Video Marketing to help us with editing a video and David did a GREAT job - responds to messages and inquiries quickly, is incredibly professional and a perfectionist in his execution, amiable personality, flexible, and great pricing for such high quality work.  We will definitely be using AZ Video Marketing in the future!

I had the sweet Thai basil with tofu... It was amazing! Everything was fresh and very tasty. I ordered for pickup and the girl at the register was incredibly sweet - she gave me a bottle of water since it was hot outside even though I had also ordered some Thai tea. It is only a couple of minutes away from my work so I intend on coming here often. :)

Great, great company! Dustin is absolutely phenomenal! He is professional, informative, courteous, punctual. He was very patient answering all of my questions and was incredibly honest as to the work that needed to be performed. So happy that they have all these well-deserved reviews so I was inclined to call them!

Absolutely the BEST!!!! I Seriously come here all the time, at least twice a week. This is in no way a hit-or-miss kind of place, there food is consistently delicious.   Being from Mexico (Baja), I am incredibly picky when it comes to tacos... I moved here back in the summer of '05 and this is the only place in all of Arizona where the tacos, from the taste of the meat to the wonderful salsas, taste just like the ones from back home.   When you dine in, they always bring you some free chips, and there salsa bar has a great variety of yummy topping to throw on their already yummy food.   And guess what? If you're a sushi fan, I have had two different rolls so far and they are both AMAZING!   Besides all the culinary masterpieces, the family that owns this small business are the most kindhearted and hard-working people I have ever met. Go and you will not be disappointed.   A mis amigos hispanos: Si quieren unos tacos como los de casa, las mejores salsas, y el mejor servicio, TIENEN QUE IR! Despues de comer en Tacos Kissi, preparense para los antojos todos los dias!! Jajaja...
