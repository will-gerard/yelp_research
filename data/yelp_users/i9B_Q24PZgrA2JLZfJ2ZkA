Absolutely loved this restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. Empanada was nice and crispy. My entree, Encocado de Camaron, was very well seasoned and had some Indian influence. Loved the plantain crisps that came with it. Definitely will return!

The food is great, but the restaurant is shady. I placed a large order through GrubHub and waited for for over an hour and a half until the expected delivery time. Then I waited another 30 minutes for good measure, when I called GrubHub they talked with the restaurant and they were informed by the restaurant that they did not have a driver and they did not make the order.   This is appalling to me, all the restaurant had to do was contact GrubHub and tell them they were not able to complete the order. I would not have been happy, but I would not have waited two hours with no food being made. This makes me re-think whether I should even return to the restaurant to eat in.

Great food! Haven't had anything there that we didn't love. Make sure to make reservations though -- there isn't much seating!

Experience was great! The decor and staff did everything they could to make me feel exceedingly comfortable. My therapist, Cara, was great and kept me  comfortable during my treatment. I will say that the amount of coconut oil used surprised me, as I was slippery with oil. This was great however, as I was able to use the showers and try their skincare products. I will definitely be back!  I even joined the membership program!
