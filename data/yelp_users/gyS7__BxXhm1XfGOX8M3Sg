Love this place. I have been coming here for over a year now and have never had such good nail service. Very good at acrylics, almond shape nails, and gel mani and Pedis. Everyone there that's worked on me has been very polite, friendly, and nice. I absolutely love it. They always have a movie playing too which is nice.

Portions are very misleading, the small to go is smaller than the in store option. Got my order completely wrong. Not worth a revisit.

So good! Just picked up a chicken Caesar salad wrap and a southwest Caesar wrap. Delicious. And great portion size too. Very fresh.
