Authentic early 20th-century soda fountain, authentically friendly staff, seriously yummy sandwiches and the best soda I've ever had!  From the street, I wasn't really sure what to expect but I'm glad that I finally ventured on in... There's a little clutter amidst the antiques and nicknacks but don't let that deter you (it's all kind of fun to peruse after you've indulged in a sundae), it's a tasty if not sentimental experience, they'll be sure to make you feel welcome, and you'll be glad that you stopped in (and they have lots and lots and lots of ICE CREAM in there, which is all you really need to know).

My second visit to the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch... the first was a wonderful experience in their small casita rooms many years ago.  I was surprised with a weekend stay for my birthday -- an upgraded "McCormick-King" room, about $200 per night, a very generous gift (a promotional rate for the resort's post-renovation reopening).  The first evening's plans included dinner via room service (due to a cake & birthday decorations already set up in the room), but there was one problem: there was neither a table upon which one might eat a room-service meal nor chairs upon which one might sit to eat it. The large room had a great king-sized bed and a leather reading chair in the corner... and it had a very large open space whereupon absolutely nothing existed, just awkward, empty space.  This didn't seem right so I went down to the front desk and asked if the McCormick-King rooms had tables in them: "no" the front desk person said, "I can have them bring up a table and chairs from the patio if you'd like...", she offered. I declined (bring up patio furniture into the third-floor room?), we'd just eat in the dining room.  Understanding that the resort had just completed its renovation, in the dining room we concluded that the reno-budget must have run into some problems, as it has all the fluorescent lighting-ambiance of a Walmart food court. Given that it's such a beautiful property, it's hard to understand how a property owner could decide, "yes, this is the ambiance that we want, and with it, we shall have loud country music streaming out from the kitchen...".    That said, and on a more positive note, our server, Sasha, provided a wonderful dining experience and our dinner was excellent.  Cheers to you, Sasha (and chef!)!  Overall recommendation: there are nicer resorts for the same price elsewhere in town; the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch is a truly beautiful property but it suffers from uncomfortable management choices.

A particularly great bookstore for those who enjoy locally owned shops... they have a little of everything, LOTS of readings, and a super friendly staff... what more could a book-nerd want?  So nice to have this cozy little gem nearby, especially given the general void of bookstores in the Phoenix Valley! (is it just me, or do others get the feeling that there are surprisingly few bookstores in this town?)

Pros:  relatively clean in the gym area on weekdays (kudos to the cleaning staff), the early morning hours are not crowded at all, and there are some very good spin instructors...  Cons:  Everything else.   For example... - two of the four Stairmasters have been broken for more than 6 weeks, another has been down for two weeks (many members, including me, have reported this weekly).  Last Friday I asked the front desk folks if they'd been fixed yet and was told that the repairman was there yesterday and they should be fine.  Nope... Still broken.   A week later (today), still broken.  - members commonly fail to re-rack their weights and equipment, even in the early hours, and the staff does NOTHING about it (it should be noted that the personal trainers seem very conscientious about putting things back when they and their clients have finished).  - the sales staff, or rather, the over-abundantly sale-oriented culture of the facility.   One year ago, my friend moved to town and was looking for a gym to join; I spoke with M--e (sales) and asked if there were any membership promotions going on, coming up, or if there was any benefit in making a referral for a new member. In short, I was told no, no, and no.   My friend came in the next day, asked if she could try out the gym for a day, but was told it would cost $15 for a one-day pass (I'm not exaggerating... members already know that the club hands out guest passes like candy and there are little yellow guest passes stacked all over the front desk every day).   My friend got a standard membership nonetheless and had to pay an initiation fee.  The very next day, posters were up all over the club about the Thanksgiving membership event -- NO INITIATION FEE!    (Message to my friend and new member: Welcome to LA Fitness, now F***-off).  - bathrooms.  It seems to be quite difficult to keep the soap dispensers filled with soap at LA-F.  Worse, they're not cleaned before opening on weekend mornings... they're in the same shape they were in when closing the night before.  It seems that the problem isn't simply this club (others speak of the same issues at other LA-F locations), it's the corporate culture of the company itself.  And so, despite having to drive a little further to get to a locally owned gym, I'll allow my membership to LA-F end this month.

I'd visit Lux every day if I lived closer, but I'm a little too far east to do so.  Nonetheless, this IS my favorite coffee house in the Phoenix Valley, and I could say that its one of my favorite locations to get a drink after work... and I could also say that their baked goods and dishes are so yummy that its one of my favorite little restaurants as well.  Its eclecticness is much of its charm, but everything is also so very well done.  Upon my first visit there -- as part of an eclectic, hardworking group of maybe 10 activists, academics, and lawyers at the end of a very long day -- our group stumbled in to Lux, which was a little disorienting having never been there and not knowing what to expect (its a very unique but comfortable environment).  Almost immediately, we were welcomed in by someone (an owner?) who found us some seats, made us some drinks, talked with us for a bit... showed me around, explained the menu to me and, despite the crazy frenetic buzz of that evening, in very short time we all felt really comfortable, a part things (for lack of a better description), and had a really nice, memorable evening.  In the mornings, coffee & espresso drinks are simply wonderful... the various freshly baked things are just wow-good.  I love Lux (see you in the morning!).

Always always always great food and GREAT service!  Small space and almost always crowded (but hey, that's D'lish), they do a great job of serving you fast.  Managers make an effort to know you and take extra good care of regulars, service in general is always great... the kind of place whereupon, given a problem or delay with you order, you just really don't mind all that much.  Biggest issue: stupid customers who seem unwilling to get out of their cars and mindlessly join the drive-thru lemmings even though they're blocking traffic on Scottsdale Rd.   No, there isn't a great deal of parking, but there's enough... and going inside is usually faster.  Like everyone else... I'm partial to the Low-Cal Breakfast (holy-shmoly its yummy!), the Nut-and-Berries Salad (also yummy), hummus plate (just right), various sandwiches, and seem unable to avoid a Breakfast Buzz (ever).

Absolute best place in Old Town for breakfast.  Service is usually quick, food is consistently good and, in my opinion, sooo much better than the "club" up the road, where breakfast is more about see-and-be-seen than quality food or good service.  I don't think recommendations here are particularly necessary because, in my experience (a couple dozen of them), whatever sounded good at the time has always been good.  That said, if you're looking for healthy & filling, the Protein & Iron is great... if seeking comfort food, Biscuits & Gravy (I'll indulge on the rare occasion, they're just so good) and like everyone else, one can't go wrong with the Protein Pancakes, but holy-shmoly they're a big mound of food... I can only eat about 1/3 of a small-stack.  *** Make sure to get there before 9:30am -- there's usually no wait, or very little... after 9:30 you should expect at least a 20 minute wait.

...and with a few passive-aggressive words, Daily Dose lost one of their most loyal customers (to see just how much I have enjoyed DD's great service and wonderful food, please read my prior review, below; it's long been my favorite breakfast spot in Old Town).  Our server was genuinely friendly and she swiftly brought out coffee, water, a couple of really yummy mimosas (it's Easter morning, so why not!) and then took our order.  Coincidentally, we both ordered the Turkey Sausage White-Out omelet (four egg whites filled with turkey sausage and mozzarella... bowl or fruit & multi-grain toast on the side); another server brought them out surprisingly quickly, I mean immediately after our order, which is when things began feeling not quite right.  Before I cut into the omelet, I put my finger on it because it didn't look hot, and it wasn't (it was a little warmer than room temperature); I cut a small bite -- the same, just kind of warm.  This made no sense... I had just placed the order and they just brought it from the kitchen.  Before I said anything about my omelet, my friend said, "I'm sending mine back, this isn't right".  I cut my omelet in half and touched the turkey sausage in the middle... it wasn't frozen but it was still cool.  I asked my friend, "Restaurants don't pre-make and reheat omelets, do they?"  I thought this might explain why they came out from the kitchen so quickly and also why they weren't really hot.  She shrugged, "I wouldn't think so...".    I really really really dislike being that pretentious/entitled guy who sends back food because it's not to his liking, so when our server checked back with us I tried to politely tell her that the eggs were just barely warm and... -- before we could finish she very courteously took up both of our plates and shook her head saying, "I'm so sorry, don't worry about it, I'll take care of it right away!" (I wish that we'd have gotten her name so we could recommend her!)  But then, Immediately thereafter, the manager on duty came over, put the palms of his hands down on the corners of our table and asked, "So, you want your omelets scalding or what?".    The passive-aggressiveness of the question was so surprising that I could only think to say, "I'm sorry?"  "I just wanted to know if you wanted them scalding," he replied.  I tried to explain that the omelets were just barely warm, the turkey in the middle was cold, etc., but he asserted "I checked it in the kitchen, it was hot".  I explained that we both thought they seemed to be reheated but he insisted, "I picked them up in my hands, they were both hot".  Sort of stunned, I looked at my friend and said, "Then I guess we're the problem... We'll just pay for these [mimosas] and go," I said.  "Don't worry about it," he said and walked away.  I put seven dollars on the table as a tip for our original server and we walked out the door, saddened about my old favorite...

Thank you Lisa's Rum Cakes... My birthday last week was a wonderfully thoughtful event and your cake was one of the best things about it (I don't care so much about gifts, but I care greatly for cake!).    I LOVE vanilla-ish cake (sorry, vanilla haters) and your white cake with vanilla custard was amazing -- best cake I've ever had, so I'm thinking seriously about celebrating my birthday next month too...  Will be in touch with you about that!..

Third trip to Mozart, exact same order:  * hummus plate * Falafel sandwich  * Spinach strawberry salad (w/ little heavenly hunks of deep fried goat cheese -- OH Lordy it's yummy) * Lemonade   Bonus: the owners are very sweet and the service is swift... there are shelves full of almond cookies and counters filled with baklava... (and my great big smiling-face at the little table next to the big windows).  Very casual place... no frills dining, just great food!

Always great people, service, and beverages at Cartel! (Wish their chairs were more comfortable... these are hard, steel little things!). ;)

This is simple:  everything is great, quite authentically German, flipping incomparable pretzels, the service is typically excellent (kind and courteous servers!) and all the brats are fab -- though I highly recommend the Moroccan lamb!     ...(and Matt, the supremely knowledgable bartender, is the person I'd hire if I owned a bar!)...   Cheers!

Favorite place, and best location, in all of Old Town.  Great patio, really great bartenders & managers, unique menu, casual & relaxed environment, inviting local feel (but, like all places in Old Town, the crowd grows a bit more glitzy as evenings roll on), nice diverse mix among the clientele.    The bartenders have always taken good care of me... hope they bring back the "Pickled Mike".  ;)

All of the wonderful reviews about Lana are true... and they are very well deserved (with my first visit, she did a great job tailoring three dress shirts three casual shirts, and a blazer).   She is abundantly professional, warm, and does indeed give great attention to detail...  you can place your full trust in the work she does!

I can only report that this is my favorite place for Pho in Scottsdale, and it's definitely a nicer / cozier dining experience than the typical Pho, Asian, or fusion restaurant -- I haven't been disappointed after a dozen or so very large bowls.  I'm looking forward to trying something else on the menu but it's hard to break from my fav!

Since discovering Sushi J, its become my favorite weekly visit.  Foremost, J (Jay?), is simply excellent at his craft and has created a nice, casual environment with excellent service from a kind staff.  He's particular about the fish he orders (i.e., making sure that certain species come from specific regions, etc.), is happy to make recommendations or create something special for you.    This is one of those places that I'd rather keep to myself and prevent the word from getting out so that I can always get a seat at the bar, but it just wouldn't be right for me to withhold my 5 stars!

...the service, attentiveness, and food all just keep getting better and better every time I'm there!  To the serious sushi lover, I could make no greater recommendation!

After many many many visits, I can only report that every experience seems to be my best experience yet.  I just cannot think of any sushi restaurant anywhere in the Phoenix valley (or elsewhere) where the quality and presentation compares... and their service has always been extremely attentive and abundantly kind.  And one really comes to appreciate Jay's insights on what's particularly good that day... He's never steered me wrong!

It's the largest Starbucks in Arizona, but the Drive-thru is definitely prioritized here.  I usually go inside and while there is rarely a line at the counter, I've always had to wait (seriously, ALWAYS!) as the baristas are busy taking care of the drive thru.  You may stand at the counter for more than a minute before anyone acknowledges you, whereupon the customary greeting is, "be with you in a minute...".  Even with five or six behind the counter they seem extremely understaffed and it's generally a cold environment (this seems odd for Starbucks as, like most locations, the other nearby locations have extremely friendly baristas)... not my favorite location to enjoy a coffee over the morning paper, a little pleasure reading, or for a meeting.  As well, my beverages of choice are quite straightforward but, here, the product is nevertheless very inconsistent (which continues to surprise me as Starbucks is generally so consistent).  I'll go to this Starbucks location only when only Cartel, Echo, or Sips are too crowded.
