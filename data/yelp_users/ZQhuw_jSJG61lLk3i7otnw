I got the eel that comes with rice and soup. The fish entree was not enough to share but if you get a dinner entree it comes with a ton of food that my husband was not able to get through and looked enough for two people. I also got the melon cream soda. Super sweet but good enough to try. Many of the other reviews mention the owner not being friendly. I disagree. We were second in line to pay, and he accidentally rang us up first. He had a hard time explaining what he had done and smiled when we figured out what he was getting at. The issue could be more of a language/culture barrier rather than not caring to give menu suggestions.   The place feels and tastes real authentic although I do agree it could be wiped down, the blinds we sat next to looked like they hadn't been clean since they were put up. Also it's uncomfortably silent, so I don't suggest bringing first dates.

I am super impressed with the service here. I don't know much about comics and was shopping for a gift. The help was not pretentious at all (which is what I've heard about most comic book stores) and gave several different options with the idea I had of what I wanted to get. The only criticism is that it was hard to find things or understand where things were because of a lack of signs. But super minor because of the service level.

After waiting for twenty minutes for our food, we asked how much longer and the waitress told us that others were there before us, so much longer, we would have to wait. Someone else will have to review the food, because we left.

This place is crazy delicious, the food is fresh, and I feel like its reasonably priced. However if you're in any kind of hurry do not go inside, even if the drive-thru line is long. They obviously give priority to those customers no matter the order. Also it's hit or miss whether the person working the drive through is any good. They either can't understand, or get annoyed with small requests (like not having the straw in the cup). But again, the food is REALLY good. So I'll keep coming back and hope for a high turnover rate.

This place has tasty food and has plenty of options for vegetarians. The atmosphere is fun for large or small groups but can be too loud at times. They have a "sit anywhere" policy which is nice but tend to not see or forget about people on the porch but you're likely to get a free appetizer out of the frequent slip up. If you're not a smoker be careful of the porch.

The self serve car wash is actually open to 7:30. I was very impressed with Jonathan, one of the workers there who went out of his way when I came really late to let me know when the vacuums shut off. He was so friendly and my got so clean considering it was a drive-thru wash. On top of everything, it was pretty reasonably priced. Definitely going back.

Beyond frustrating to come on time, wait for 45 minutes, and only be told that they're running behind after they're asked. I get that emergencies happen; sometimes two like the day I came in. But why would you not call me ahead of time or inform me when I came in? The woman at the desk didn't seem sorry that they had inconvenienced us, and when I asked how much longer, she wouldn't give me a time because I might be "disappointed if it was longer." The only positive thing I can say is at least the refund was quick.
