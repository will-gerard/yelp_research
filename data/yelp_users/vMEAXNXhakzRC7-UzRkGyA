it was our first time to order their lunch special for delivery yesterday. The chow mein and Flamingo Palace chicken was really tasty so those were good. We were quite disappointed with the crab wontons because it was soggy and bland - same with the egg roll and egg drop soup. It tasted like water with food coloring in it. Not going back. :(

It was our first time eating at this restaurant last week and I think we will be back soon! The place was small but neat - we arrived about dinner time (6pm) and there was a lot of customers but they manage to serve us quickly so other waiting customers can be entertained and seated right away.    We ordered the Chicken Satay, Pad Thai, Red Duck Curry and Crab Fried rice and everything was delicious! Our total bill was about $40 bucks but we had a lot of left over so I think it is worth your money.

Front desk is very welcoming, they try to remember you personally and I am very pleased with my Optometrist, Dr. Hoppert - she is very patient, takes her time to listen and evaluate your needs and very passionate at what she does. She made sure my prescription was as close as she can get my vision to see 100% and I am very happy about that.   I will refer this clinic to friends and family :)

We were driving around this part of town and craved some Asian food. I Yelped it out and found this place with lots of good feedbacks so I got pretty excited myself.   My family and I went here around lunch time on a Friday. As soon as we walked in, the hostess greeted us with a smile.   We had the crab puff as our appetizer, nothing really special about it BUT compared to other Chinese restaurants, theirs was the biggest and most filled crab puffs I've ever had! I had the Mongolian beef combo, the beef was so tender and the veggies were cooked just right! Not soggy but not undercooked. Their egg flower soup was also great! My boyfriend ordered the chicken chop suey and he was pretty satisfied himself! My daughter loved the lomein and orange chicken (I did too).   Overall the service, price, food and ambiance was great! It was a nice experience so we are definitely coming back to try some more of their dishes!

Found a Groupon deal for $40 Gel Manicure and Footspa Pedicure. Here are my observations:   Pros:  1. Making an appointment by booking online was easy.  2. Few services available - haircut, trim, highlights, color, mani, pedi and threading.  Cons: 1. Location was little hard to park at.  2. Salon studio was dirty - hair and nails on the floor. Broken massage chair.  3. No swatches of the Gel color. You literally had to open each one to check out the color.  4. Donna did my pedicure and I was very unsatisfied of her work. She barely removed cuticles, barely massaged my legs and she kept talking and talking the entire time. The entire pedicure literally lasted 10 minutes from the time I sat and until my polish was finished. Same with my Gel Manicure.   I think I could've gotten more for my $40 at another footspa/pedicure place. I do not think I will ever come back to NV Hair Studio nor will I recommend it,

If you're looking for a quick, clean, fun and ALMOST pain free waxing salon, look no further! I've been a loyal customer of Lindsey for about a year now and every time I come in she always does a smooth and wonderful job!   I have skin issues (eczema and psoriasis) all over my body but she never made me feel nervous while doing a braz wax. She is absolutely amazing and very friendly!   I keep on referring my friends to her and will keep on doing so. Thanks Lindsey! :)

Went here on a Sunday for brunch and had an "Okay" experience.   The sign on their door said they open at 10:30am. We walked in at 10:50 and the crew in front said to hang out for a little bit because they do not open until 11am. So that's one star off.  The cashier was a young petite lady who spoke so soft, I could barely hear what she was saying and had to ask a couple of times to repeat what she said and for her to talk a little louder. She also did not put on any smile on her face so she looked like she was so tired of her job and was not very entertaining at all. Another star off.  I ordered the Pad Thai and it was an okay dish - it had more chicken and shrimp. What disappointed me most was the noodles were bland, plain and dry, as if there wasn't any pad thai sauce so I had to go back and ask the staff for the sauce. It was okay after that. Another star off.  My boyfriend got the Alfredo which tasted really good except that it was mostly veggies and meat not much noodles.  The place and ambiance was great and clean.   I think overall the restaurant has so much potential. I plan to check out their other dishes but probably not in the near future.

It was my first visit at Emily's studio today. She did color correction and gave me a haircut and I am absolutely impressed on how she got my DRY, FRIED, dead, bleached hair back to life. I went from blonde to red head and totally loved it! She is absolutely very accommodating, witty, and tries to get to know her clients very well. Will be coming back to her!
