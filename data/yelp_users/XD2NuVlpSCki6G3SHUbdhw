So disappointed.... smallest cuts of happy hour Nigiri I've ever seen in my life.... it was kind of funny actually.

I really liked this place.  Sushi and rock 'n roll... what a great combination!  The food was great and the bartender Jimmy really did a fantastic job.  I'm coming back.  Great Old Town stop.

I have to say that this is a great authentic Italian/Sicilian restaurant. It's as simple as that... if you like great food, you'll definitely like this place. My favorites are the Ramano pizza (ask the owner Gasper to put an egg on it!) and the chicken piccatta. Oh yeah... the desserts are homemade too.

Mike and Chelsea were soooo great! They were exactly what you would want representing your business.  Top notch!

I really enjoyed myself. It was the second time I had gone there and both times the staff was extremely friendly. And the food is great too... I had the hummus platter and the chicken pesto flatbread.  Thumbs up!
