Easily the best comic book store in Phoenix. No gaming crowd hanging around, the staff is always amicable and helpful, I can always expect to be greeted at the door with a friendly smile and welcoming attitude. The store is clean, well lit and easy to navigate. New releases are in alphabetical order and have the last few months issues nearby in case you missed something. One of the best features of this establishment is the collection of consignment books, packaged together as runs at VERY reasonable prices. If you are looking for a specific story line, or filling in gaps in your collection, check this section out as they always have a great selection. The interior displays are always changing, with over stock deals, grab bags and more packaged runs rotating in on a regular basis. Their trade collection is second to none. They have a great back issue selection on the floor, and if its not in the bins, they probably have it out back. Their claim of "over 1 million comics in stock" is easy to believe.  Some other reviewers have complained that the store doesn't have couches and chairs, but that is fine with me. I tend to avoid the stores with lots of people hanging around for two reasons: 1) the books are probably all messed up and read, and 2) those stores tend to have the clich√© clubhouse/comic book fanboy feel; if you aren't part of the club, you aren't welcome. NEVER had that vibe here.   I've also seen complaints that the prices for some items are high, based on other stores in the valley. I've never felt that here either. The prices are very competitive and again, the multi issue packs are always a FANTASTIC value. I've bought tons of stuff here, and never felt ripped off. In fact, I've picked up runs that i would probably never have looked at before, simply because they are packaged together already, so I don't have to dig through the bins, and they are being offered at a very reasonable price.    I've probably tried all the shops in the valley, and this is the one to beat. If you are looking for a comic book store, not a gaming store that just happens to sell comics, this is it.

Hit or miss. You have to be there at lunch or dinner rush to get fresh food that hasn't sat and dried out all day. They will usually make fresh food for you if you ask and are wiling to wait, so that's a plus. The fact that you HAVE to ask is NOT a plus, because they do not have a problem giving you a dried out nasty scoop of yuck if that's all that's in the pan.   All of the negative reviews do not surprise me. I once found a piece of broken glass in my Beijing Beef, about the size of a grain of rice. Nearly ate it but felt it at the last second.   That being said, it's a long steam table in a cruddy shopping plaza.  I'm not expecting gourmet food here. I am usually happy with what I get, especially if I get them when stuff is fresh. It is what it is.

Olive Garden continues its slow down hill slide. This particular location had a leaky awning out side draining water onto the benches out side. The staffs answer to this was to throw napkins on the wet bench. Wait staff was unfriendly and inattentive. Salad literally tasted like it had a cigarette butt in it. Bread sticks were cool and extra salty. Waited over 45 minutes for entrees to be served. Waitress dumped my wife's leftovers and mine together in one box, despite both meals being VASTLY different and not compatible. TERRIBLE SERVICE, WORSE FOOD. GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE...

Probably the best Chinese take out in Phoenix. Not saying much. I've tried a lot around here and this is the closest to how I remember Chinese food as a kid. Still not that great. Has a lot of the same problems most of the places around here have. Doesn't taste fresh, poor quality and cuts of meat. If you get white breast chicken, it isn't SO bad, but just normal is nearly inedible. Everything tastes too greasy for me.   (What happened to all the GOOD Chinese take out? I don't remember it all being this bad when I was younger.)  But again, this place is the best of the worst. Staff is friendly, food is ok if you get that craving, restaurant seems pretty clean and you get pretty generous portions. Check it out.

Friendly staff. Clean store. Great products you have come to expect. Can be a little slower than normal when busy. Easy to get stuck in the drive through and not be able to get out if it's taking too long. Have been late to work more than once because of this. But all in all a good location.

First time in. Food looked and smelled great. Restaurant was clean and well lit. Friendly staff were patient with us as we decided what we wanted. I had the BBQ pulled pork burrito.  She had tacos and tortilla soup. Great all around.  We'll be back.

Beyond disgusting. Food was cold. And old. If you like eating bad leftovers that have been reheated time and time again, you will love this place. Restaurant was filthy. And while we were there the manager actually turned away a party of 5 because they wanted to sit at an 8 top. The restaurant was 3/4 empty and this was Friday night at 6:30. Save yourself and never come here. Can I give it less than 1 star?

Friendly staff, quick service. The new store employees make an effort to engage each customer. Same jimmy johns food, but in a fresh new spot. Clean, good food, reasonable prices, go in late and get a good deal on day old bread.

+This place is a lot nicer inside than outside.   +Friendly attendant when we were there, and they were able to provide laundry soap when we forgot ours.   +Free Wi-Fi (ask attendant for password)  -A card based system, rather than coin op, so we will probably have money left over on the card, which will almost certainly get lost.   Basically, we only came here to wash our comforters that wouldn't fit in out washer at home. Was a nice surprise to find it clean, well maintained and fairly empty considering it was a Sunday. Primary negative for me is the card based system instead if coin op machines. I understand why it's done, but it's aggravating to have money tied up on a card we will probably not use again for 6 months or more. There are 29 machines, and 26 dryers, and all were working and clean. I imagine it can get pretty crowded and busy during prime laundry hours, but was pretty empty when we came Sunday night around 5pm. Vending machines were pretty bare but there is a market next door and a CVS down the street. Would definitely come back.

Greg is the only tattoo artist I will see in Arizona. He had tattooed both myself and my wife multiple times over the last few years and the work is amazing. I don't need to talk about his artistic ability as his work speaks for itself. What separates Greg from everyone else is that he takes the time to really give you the best tattoo you could ask for, from initial concept through the final execution. He works with you to make sure the design and placement will look the best it can on you, which sounds like a no brainier, but there are many people out there that will just put on whatever you ask for, where ever you ask for it, without any thought to the true meaning of and expression of body art. What you think will look good somewhere may not always translate the way you think it will. Your skin is not a static piece of paper, and a real great artist will be able to take skin movement into account when designing your tattoo and placing it. You don't have to worry about your amazing tattoo folding up on you when you move or twisting and distorting because it was just slapped on in the wrong place or your body part was in an unnatural position while being tattooed. Greg will take all of this into account before the first line is made. You are never made to feel rushed in or out of his chair and can be sure to never feel like you are bothering him by asking questions. A great tattoo artist is more than just someone who can draw on skin, and with Greg you get that great tattoo artist. I will be getting many more tattoos from Greg and can't wait to see this shop become a major player in the Valley.
