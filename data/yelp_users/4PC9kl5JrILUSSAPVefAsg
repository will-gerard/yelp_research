Let's get a couple of things out of the way. The smoking while I eat is not good, but I guess that's the price I'll pay to enjoy one of the best outdoor atmospheres in Tempe.  Food: to me this place is complex on simple food. The oysters Rockefeller are some of the best I've ever had and this is a place in the middle of the desert. Fish and chips came soggy and the taste was not all there. The potatoe skins on would assume are regular bar skins when they arrive but it's not. The potatoes were actually hearty potatoes and not the thin disks you get at EVERY other place. The green Chile enhances the expected flavors of a generic skin and takes it maybe a level above. Let's go back to the oysters... why because I crave them.  Service: laid back but sweet and suggestive when asked. Good job.

My father went to this school when it was PIRE and now he is on the #1 (sometimes #2) team in the state of Arizona. He has been ranked for the last 12 years. Stewart Walowitz is his name and I thank not only him but AARE for my success as well. After attending a different school i lost interest in real estate, then my dad said transfer over to AARE and see what you think. The teachers were interactive and the class sizes were not overwhelming. I am proud to say that the school regained my interest in real estate. I passed both my test for the school and then passed both the state and national portion. The staff is very friendly and quick to respond in any way that they can help. I had my 90 hour certificate from another school and transferred over. The prep class was amazing, small enough to get some one on one time and large enough to where others would ask questions that I didn't even think of. A true professional institution.

The worst car wash ever. It took well over an hour on a "dead" day. I got the middle wash and there were footprints still on my maths there were scuff marks on my in side panels there's still dirtiness on my hood and this is still four times after I told them to clean it. There's also a lady inside who had to contact her insurance because the carwash messed up her car. I would rather buy all of the material and have a cross 15 times as much then go back to that place. If I was allowed to give negative stars to a place this would get - 5 I've never been to a worse car wash in my entire life.

I am a taco connoisseur, with that being said Sol in the Scottsdale quarter is amazing. Let me start with the service. Arnaldo was easily in the top 3 servers I've ever had at any restaurant... Carmen at Sol is in there as well. When I first came here I ordered a bunch of tacos easily 15 and said no cilantro at all. With my request he did it and the tacos basically came plain. He then saw the upset look on my face and told me how their sauces were made with cilantro and he wanted to make sure I wasn't allergic. Once I told him it was OK he came back with all the sauces and made them table side and explained every one perfectly and they were delicious. Kudos to Arnaldo. Carmen has always put a smile on and has recommended great apps and is just an overall great server and a pleasure. Oh and now they both recognize me when I come in. THE FOOD... To die for. From apps to specialty tacos even down to the street tacos for taco Tuesday. The dessert... LA Guera is addicting and I usually get one to go. (Also the banana chocolate bread pudding)  Thanks guys!

If I can give you 0 stars I would. I used to love / I just look forward to the driver said I would get to be with that or I mean and the stories that I could tell the next day. Now I just noticed that you guys are all just money grabbers everyone don't care they don't follow the five minute I have to stay there rule because you might be paying your bill where you might be saying bye to friends. Hoover besides this racist CEO could be the worst service I've ever used in my entire life. I requested 3 / drivers at the same location that I usually get picked up at in Old Town Scottsdale. Because all of them thought that they had something better to do i download left innocence 3 minutes is there and then we took me home and made sure that I was ok going home. Hoover you're pathetic I'm deleting your app honestly think that you should screen all of your drivers because they all suck and that's just me being honest best of luck in the future I will bring your IPO comes out is fails and that's that

I try to go at least once a week. I would say best restaurant in Tempe, but it might be one of the best in all the valley. They actually listen to the customers too...example the steak with chimichuri was a special  and myself and a bunch of buddies who frequent the revival said they need it back...last week went back to a new summer menu with the steak on it!!! Yummmm

Modernized southern classics that make you drool. Great atmosphere and incredible service. I ordered 3 apps an entr√©e and two desserts along with a few sides with a friend and had zero complaints, only compliments...to the chef.
