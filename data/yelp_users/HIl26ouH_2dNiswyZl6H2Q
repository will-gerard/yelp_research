Met some friends here last night with high expectations due to good reviews. We had a party of 10 so we made sure we were there right when they opened at 5pm. They sat us immediately but when  we asked them up front (before we ordered) to split the checks they had a bit of an attitude. We made it a game to get them to lighten up. Which they did! A for effort on the waitresses part. We had her laughing and smiling.  I should mention here that when we walked in it smelled fishy as well. Not a good sign for a sushi place. This should have been our second red flag. Food came fairly quickly. It was ok nothing special and a bit overpriced for what you get. Towards the end they started to rush to get us out which we would have gladly done 30 minutes prior if they would bring our checks. By the time we got home I was extremely sick and that was how the rest of my night went! I am not new to sushi. In fact its my fav! I would NEVER go back to this place. The only reason its getting 1 star is because the waitress was a hoot!

Amazing food, fun atmosphere!  We went on a Saturday night so there was a DJ playing music too. Because they are so popular be prepared to wait to be seated and for your food but just chill cause it's worth the wait. :-)

A tiny place in a nondescript strip mall. You wouldn't think to look twice at it but I tell ya...it's AMAZING! Hubby had the lamb special and I had the Moroccan chicken. Both were great but the Moroccan chicken was actually to die for! Portions are HUGE so expect to have leftovers the next day. (I believe it's $5 extra to split  something so just go with having leftovers you won't regret it) I'm not a leftover kinda girl but I hoarded these leftovers like you wouldn't believe. The owner is the cook and the daughter is the waitress. The sweetest women ever. The rest of the staff was fun too!  We had a party of 11 so it could have been a handful but they handled it well and made it fun!  Quick tip. ...the place is tiny so make a reservation if you have a large group. Our group of 11 took up half the restaurant.  :)

I had a great time tonight with friends!  First time at North Mountain Brewing Co.  Good service, good food and good live music. Not sure who the musican was but amazing flute playing (think jethro tull)! Only reason it's not getting 5 stars is it's a bit loud when you have a large group talking together and the waitress started out letting us know the beer specials were on some wall when you enter the building rather than just telling us or giving a specialty menu. Kinda strange but you easily get past it with their good service and food. Btw had the heffiweisen beer. Yum.

Cute hole in the wall. The best kind of place. Great tacos (had the grilled fish, yum!). And nice staff, Sam was the sweetest!  Also The French Grocery is next door so you can stop and grab some bread for dinner. It's a two-fer! ;)
