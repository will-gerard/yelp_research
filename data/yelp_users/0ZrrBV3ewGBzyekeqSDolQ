We paid $200 to have a car we just purchased from a private owner detailed. What a joke!!!! We dropped it off early around 9:30 am and was told that it would be finished this afternoon and they would give us a call. Finally after not hearing anything at 4 we called. They told us it would still be an hour and they would call us. We decided to go dinner  and to swing by to see if it was ready since they would be closing at 6. It was sitting in the parking lot. No call that it was finished. We went in and they said we could take it. They did  a terrible job! I've had $10 car washes that were cleaned better. The inside of the glove compartment hadn't been touched, the side door panels hadn't been touched and the trunk was not done not even vacuumed. We will never go back and definitely would not recommend them. They ripped us off.

On September 4th I went and purchased an adapter for our HP Laptop because the last one was getting hot and quit working. I asked them what was the best cord to get and they gave me an adapter and said that it would work for $76.65. I got it home and it didn't work so I tried to return it with the receipt. I was told I couldn't return it even though it had only been a couple of days and because I followed their advice. Now I am stuck with a cord I don't need and down $76 bucks! Not sure they understand the term customer service.

If I could give 0 stars for Direct TV I would. They are so dishonest! They bait and switch you whenever they can. My bill continues to grow larger every month because they add things without asking me. I found out that I was paying $14 a month for a Premier Protection plan I never asked for but apparently signed off on when the technician came out. BEWARE!!! Read everything in every contract or piece of paper they send or have you sign. They decided I needed their Super Sports Package and I ended up paying for it for 2 months before I caught it. I don't even watch sports so I didn't even know I had it until it was too late. I have to look at every bill every month to make sure they don't add fees or crap I don't want. They start you out with a great deal only to screw you when you are good and stuck in their 2 year contract. I ended up having to move and had to have them come install their service to finish my contract out. The catch is you are automatically signed up for a new 2 year contract when you move to a new location!!!! So they screw you bad when you move so don't move until your Direct TV contract is up. I really wish there were more regulations regarding this crooked company.

These people have no business being in business. We went in to order and stood at the counter for 10 min before a gentleman even acknowledged us. When he did he was rude and said it would be 20 minutes before we would get our food! We hadn't even orderd yet. Never been treated so rudely! We walked out.
