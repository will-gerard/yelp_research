Cherry blossom is a not so secret gem in Phx. Always busy, and always delicious. This evening Josh was our server and he made it a 5 star experience. Josh was very friendly, knowledgable, and made the perfect pairing based on our taste. Cherry blossom is a must in Phx and Josh makes it a can't miss.

AWKWARD as attending your ex husbands wedding to your former best friend...best way to sum up tonight's dinner at Moto.  Let me start with saying, I love Moto, come often, Charity and another server, tall, dark hair, black rimmed glasses, tattoos (mad at myself I can't recall his name right now) are amazing. Know the menu, attentive and personable without being fake and obnoxious. I honestly will wait for a table in their section rather than risk not having the experience I've become custom to. Tonight...I will keep it as brief as I can. - gentleman who sat us was literally dripping in sweat. It's July, it's miserable I get it. It was not really getting my appetite going watching him drip all over our menus clearly frazzled. - the restaurant was clearly way busier than anyone expected given its summer and 7 pm on a Thursday. They were understaffed, but hey, it's summer in AZ. Things slow down.  - the ONLY people who appeared frazzled and annoyed the restaurant was busy...was the swamp monster who sat us (assuming some sort of lead / management position and a man in a purple polo. The servers and the ONLY sushi chef seemed to be on point and not showing the customers any sort of panic.  Let's talk about purple polo. It was unclear if he was a off duty Moto fun police officer. Customer who self appointed himself as the boss. Or just an unhappy man on a mission to ruin everyone's night. He spent 85% of his time sitting at the bar socializing with what appeared to be regulars, and the 15% terrorizing the staff with his overly anxious approach.  He actually felt it was necessary and appropriate to pull out server outside right in front of the CLEAR glass door for everyone to to see him, what appeared to be grilling her. Regardless if it was a slap on the wrist or a celebration of her great service. Not appropriate, and unprofessional. The restaurant was packed and she was clearly capable of handling her tables...well until he removed her to publicly humiliate her. It was unprofessional and a poor example of what I assume would be management? Save it for off hours. Oh, and maybe not chill at the bar while your understaffed restaurant busts their ass and then ridicule and undermine in front of their customers. Normally, I would give 5 stars to Moto. My husband and I left dinner from one of our favorite places disgusted and mortified by the stranger in the purple polo strange and unprofessional behavior. I hope he reads this review and feels ashamed and apologizes to his hard working staff.

Ok, so I totally agree with the other reviewers, the pricing at Danese is crazy! There is no method to their pricing structure, and it seems to change each time--which can be totally annoying.  However, I find they do an amazing job. I have never had a bad job done on any of my pieces. On average I bring a piece a month and are always impressed with the quality. I would not bring a forever 21 dress there to be altered, because you would pay more than the dress itself, but for those $200 jeans, for sure. My only hold back is the pricing, other than that, I would say they are the best in Phoenix for sure.

i wanted to follow up on my first review and throw in an extra star for my last visit to Danese. I bought a pair of skinny jeans (g star) that I brought into Danese for hemming, as I do all of my jeans. After picking them up (24 hours later, talk about fast) I noticed they were shorter than I remember use discussing and marking while I was in the shop. i was out of town, so I wore the jeans and dealt with my indifference over the weekend. I was going to let it go figuring, what can really be done? I called the shop and spoke to the owner's husband who happened to be the one who marked my jeans and he advised me to "bring them on in, and we will take a look." Both the owner and hubby were there and I tried my jeans on. Because they are skinny, he said they looked about right. I explained to him that I clearly recall use making them longer because I wanted the option to wear them with flats. No arguing the owner offered to extend them out an 1/2 inch. That was the best she could offer with the materials she had to work with. I found the offer to be fair, then she hit me with "can you buy another pair of the jeans?" my response was yeah, but why would I? She then offered to pay me for my jeans (keep in mind these are $200 jeans). I couldn't believe it. I was floored. Of course I was thrilled by such a nice offer, but would never accept that. It was an honest mistake, one that I am sure I somehow played a part in. Both husband and wife said if i wasn't happy after they pulled the hem out, that they would pay for a new pair of jeans for me. The offer alone reminded me why I take all of my alterations there, and why I will continue to do so.   I am shocked by the other reviews stating that they are rude. That is crazy! I have never had a bad experience there, even before  this incident. If anything they are too nice! How many places do same day alterations? Give them a try!

Love love love!! Danese saved my a** today. Hours before my wedding I called Danese and they agreed 2 hours before closing to alter my reception dress and didn't even charge a rush fee. Amazing!! I love these ladies

Ok, if you watched Seinfeld, you are familiar with the term "soup Nazi" and you know where I am going with this...  The food is AMAZING. The best Thai in Phoenix (next to Thai Rama their 2nd location) but the service, ughh well, keep your expectations VERY LOW.   Special requests are not welcomed and rarely honored, but the food is well worth the emotional abuse you endure. Check it out, it is a great eat!

Well, if you love to bedazzle all of your clothes, this store has just saved you hours of studding your jeans. Its very Scottsdale and very  overpriced. Even after spending 45 minutes trying to force myself to love something, I left empty handed and feeling dirty. The worker are over dressed, over bronzed and over worked. It was a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.  Maybe this is why they can't keep any of their mall locations open or their Arcadia location a float. Save your house from foreclosue and head to Nordy's.

Looking for service with a smile? Go somewhere else. But if you want good food at really reasonable prices--this is your place.   My group at work had a team lunch here (12) and I arrived early to alert the wait staff that we were apart of the "separate check club." Our lovely waitress gave me the look of death. She really didn't respond, so I wasn't sure if she actually heard me, so I repeated myself again. Sunshine cut me off and said "I got it." Ok, you got it? So you will bring 12 separate checks right? umm not so much. Sunshine brought one check and felt the need to make the comment "we usually look down upon this."  Uncomfortable.  To be nice, once again. I wrote everyone's name and the amount to charge them on the check, pretty easy right? Apparently not for Sunshine. I got the eye roll. For a split second I considered kicking her in the face, but with my boss sitting across the table from me, I didn't think it was wise.  On the flip side, the food was really good. My pizza was delish, and the house salad dressing was so could, you can drink right from the bottle. Worth the try for sure. Just leave your pride and self esteem at the office.

I have been going to Alta Vista for years. We started when we found a stray on a Sunday who was covered in ticks and very ill. In a panic we go ogle searched vets and they were the only one open on Sundays. They were very helpful and sweet with our little stray who we were able to find a good home for. After that experience and the convenience of a vet open 7 days a week, we became regulars.  Through the years we lost and gained some pets. We had a puppy that passed away in a freak accident that we needed help with and they were wonderful. The vet tech even cried when she saw the poor little thing.   More recently, our hyper 10 month old puppy got out and was hit by a car in front of my house. I was home alone and in a panic. I could not even catch my breathe. Our puppy severely injured hid under our bed as he began to bleed out. After 10 minutes of failed attempts to get him out we called Alta Vista begging for help. NOT an ounce of hesitation two vet techs showed up at our home within 20 minutes. They were able to get our puppy out and to the hospital safely. After my husband and I arrived Dr. Penn greeted us and quickly explained what his injuries were and what our options were. He called other doctors for their advice and really offered us unbiased advice which was refreshing. Dr. Penn and the staff at Alta Vista have been really wonderful to work with. Dr. Penn has even called us on his days off to give us updates on our dog's condition so we aren't left in the dark.   i will say sometimes the waits are long, but it's well worth the trade off.

I struggle with this one.  The total hipster "I'm too cool to talk to you" vibe is so annoying, I avoided Hub for almost a year. If it weren't for the rare selection of G Star for women, I wouldn't even give it a second bother. I always found the sales staff to be over the top fake and aggressive, luckily that has calmed down a notch. Don't get overly excited, they still are overbearing and suggest things you really don't want to try on while you are in the fitting rooms. However, the staff in general is much more calm and relaxed than what it was a few years ago.  Tom, the owner has the pushy salesmen quality, however, he knows his stuff. Want to know if you look fat? Or if your ass is flat in those $200 jeans? Tom will tell you. He will quickly offer you an alternative, but that is 100 times better than buying something unflattering. His younger employees haven't really caught on to the whole "being honest" thing, but maybe some day they will get there.  My biggest wish for hub is that they would expand their price point a tad. After springing over $200 on jeans, you kind of would like the option to buy a top for $40 to $60 or a necklace for less than $300. I also wish they would tap into the local designer market, and feature local designs from Phoenix. They sort of lost the small boutique feel when they expanded and moved to their bigger location.  I still prefer to work with Jesse when I stop into Hub. He is very calm, nice, honest and easy to work with, not to mention he has worked there forever.

Sprinkles who??? This is my fav local bakery (I often pick up a treat from LGO) for their amazing OOEY GOOEY cupcakes. The name should say it all! The cake is rick and moist while the frosting is a little piece of heaven.   You must stop by and grab yourself a treat, you will forget all about Sprinkles cupcakes and be in love!

Love!!! The prices are mixed. Some things are shocking and others i fund to be real finds. It's very unique and features several local artists. Georgeann the owner is friendly and helpful without being pushy or agressive.  Great for gifts as well.   Frances is my new obsession!

Ok, let's start with the good things:  Food is great  FULL bar  Great prices  Good service  AMAZING outdoor seating   Bad things:  Flooded with DOMS (Dirty old men)  Crowded with cougars  Smokey patio  PAID parking   I live in the area and love this bar. It is always my top pick (which Parlor has recently stole) and I generally always enjoy myself.  The parking sucks. You have to pay and they monitor the surrounding lots like they are the Mafia or something. The prices are great and the food is surprisingly good. The atmosphere is hit or miss depending on the crowd. Being a married 20-something, I am not a big fan of men old enough to be my father in True Religions crowding my space. The good news is, you can always count on the Arcadia cougars to distract the young guys from bothering you. :) Its a great local hang out and worthy of a Saturday night.

If all natural means dry and bland, then this cupcakes are definitely "natural."  I was super excited to try Lulus, and then was quickly disappointed. They were out of everything and the cake texture was like cardboard. Whipped frosting? ummm where is my cream cheese?  Save your $3 and go grab a happy hour beer.

To die for!!  My husband and I tried Strip Steak on a whim and fell in love instantly. I started off with the cucumber martini and was totally impressed with how much I enjoyed this funky cocktail. Then we moved on to the grilled cheese and tomato soup app, and fell in love. And don't get me started on the prime rib. Words cannot describe the taste of this dish. The only bummer was, that we didn't discover this place the first night!

Heaven. Fuego is just heaven. This super small, yet charming place is our favorite!! The menu is unique, and delish!! The creamed corn is to die for, I am talking unbelievable!!  Thirsty? Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour.  Only negative is, that because of its small size, it fills up fast. reservations are a must!

LOVE this little gem tucked away in a strip mall. The clothes are amazing and the shoes are better than most large department stores. The only draw back is that some of the prices can be high and a little shocking. Great place for unique finds and great sales.  LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!

Tutor Time is a great day care for the price. The facility is clean and the staff is overall really friendly. Some of the staff is questionable. Not that they aren't good people, the personalities are a bit drab. I am really happy with the care my child receives and I feel like he is in good hands. His development has really excelled and I feel like his mood is much better at the end of the day!

You would think with the economy being what it is today, it would be easy for any establishment to hire semi-intelligent people to run the register.  I went into sprinkles to taste some of their fall specials and I walked into a scene that was beyond depressing. My first experience with Sprinkles is when I lived in LA. You couldn't get a cupcake without waiting in line at least 30 minutes. Scottsdale, you have 4 perky girls greeting you, with their cupcake themed baby tees the minute you walk through the door.  The trays were empty and the selection was bare at best. I ordered 4 cupcakes. NOT rocket science. 1-2-3-4  There was one other woman waiting for a large order, a couple dozen at least. The dingbat ringing us up tried to charge me over $80 for 4 cupcakes!! Whoa! "Are you sure those are mine?"  Her response was "is your name Susan?" No it is not. She gives me a blank look like she saw a ghost. So this is uncomfortable. I kindly nudged her by saying "I think my total should be in the $13 range, I only got 4 cupcakes. "  "The tag says you got 4 dozen." (i can't remember the exact qty)  Now Red Velvet (remember the themed shirts?) is testing my patience. Is that still Susan's order?  Oh duh! Now we get it!  After all that I get the cupcakes home, and they are dryer than a popcorn fart. Disappointing.

Sundrops leaves me torn and confused.  I wanted to love Sundrops, I really did. When I saw the make over happening as I would pop in Baskin Robbins, I was super excited someone finally decided to open a nicer nail spot in the Arcadia area.   My husband gave it a whirl when it first opened. (he needs pedicures more than I do. Just sayin.) He came home "ehh" and feeling ripped off. With this I just stuck to my little Asian spot and avoided Sundrops. After having a bad experience at my long time nail place, I gave Sundrops a try---and was umm, OK with it. I wasn't jumping out of my chair, I was actually annoyed because my tech talked my ear off the ENTIRE time and took her sweet ass time on my manicure so she could tell me about her son's wedding. I think the awkwardness of not knowing what the nail techs are saying to each other is better than being sucked in to someones life.  Because I wanted to love this place so much I gave it another try. My tech this time was OK, a little weird. I felt her looking at me the whole time, not in a creepy way, just more of a judgmental way. I wasn't in love and my pedicure lasted less than a week. Because I am a sucker for a cute spot I went back a third time and brought my 12 yr old niece this time. The owner was there...and it made the vibe weird, and tense. She needs to take some evening development courses on how to treat customers and engage with them. the girl who did my nieces toes was nice and changed the color once to make her happy, so I was fine with that. Lucky me, I got the same tech as my 2nd visit. Yippeee. My pedicure sucked. Enough said. As we were checking out I was admiring the owner's top which I noticed she was selling in the "boutique" area...I use that word loosely. She made ZERO attempt to sell it to me. Like nada. It was like I was putting her out by asking her about the fit, etc. I ended up buying the top and $176 later we were on our way home.  The owner has a great eye for fashion, but not running a business or nail salon for that matter. I think she needs to close shop and reopen a boutique she doesn't work in.  Needless to say, I am OVER Sundrops and are happy with my new sport, Ken's nails on 48th/Indian School in the Safeway center.

This is the perfect spa for those must have treatments without destroying your bank account! Kara is the best! She sure knows how to wax a good brow! She also gives great facials and has the best personality! The manicure ladies are a bit stuffy, but its well worth dealing with for the clean atmosphere.

Ok, so it isn't excactly Ling's, it's more Louie's. I would describe it as asian inspired with a healthy twist.  This is hands down my favorite lunch spot. They make amazing food, and at great deals. Not to mention it is so conveinently next door to Golden Spoon yogurt. :)  The only down fall is this total creep that works the bar. Mid 50's, greesey pony tail, dangly earring..total weirdo. He is a space invader for sure. I go through a state of panic each time i go with the thought that I could end up in his section. He is one of those who thinks he is 20-something, attractive and funny. He gets down on his knees (so he is at your level sitting) and just joins the conversation. It is really annoying and almost enough to make me avoid the joint.

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Best yogurt place ever! This is what yogurt should be! This greek style frozen yogurt is healthier for you, and just as affordable as that sugar loaded junk TCBY feeds you!  The staff is a little young and customer service is not their thing, but the yogurt is worth the lack of smiles in the place!

If you have a pet, you should be at the Noble Beast.  My poor dog has been suffering from severe allergies for years and nothing seemed to work. We spent thousands on test, treatments and yuppy dog food trying to just help the poor thing from chewing herself to death. On my last glimmer of hope I stopped by the Noble Beast and felt an instant sigh of relief. This (kind of cute) guy with a pony tail was more than happy  to help me and starting giving me options within minutes. He took a good look at my dogs allergy report and explained why she should or shouldn't eat certain things. I ended up buying a Venison and Sweet Potato food for my dog and within in 2 weeks the redness cleared up and the chewing stopped by 50%. I couldn't believe it. I have been a faithful customer since!

Yo dude, your a douche, no man you are a douche. You'll never get laid...  This is just a sneak peak of the ridiculous conversation I had to listen to while waiting for my sandwich today. The immature zit faced kid that rang me up, kept interrupting my order to banter with his coworker who was just wondering around the store front. I ordered the hummus veggie sandwich and the ONLY reason I gave this sh*t hole 1 star is because my sandwich was awesome. The behavior of these soon to be 40 year old virgins was enough to drive me to 3 Advil and never go back. The older gentlemen in the back who I couldn't figure out what his role was just argued with the teens and cracked lame jokes of his own. I find it impossible to believe that in this horrible economy THAT is the best they can do.   The highlight of my visit is when the cashier started to mock a car in the lot then had the balls to turn to me and ask if it were mine. HELLO DUMB-ASS, usually you clarify this prior to making fun of it. Not sure if I was supposed to be impressed or what exactly the purpose of this behavior was supposed to prove. If I were the owner of this shop, I would be embarrassed and horrified.

I have purchased several bags from balenciaga and this location, and always left thrilled.  After visiting the weekend of New Years,  Chiemi helped me and sadly did not have what I was looking for HOWEVER...She took down my info and I was certain it was to humor me and not actually follow up with me. Not only did she follow up with me , but twice--different bags and weeks apart. leading me to purchasing  another bag I didn't need, but loved!. She was really sweet, professional and accommodating. If ur in Vegas go visit her and don't be fooled. They have an ridiculous back stock. Request Chiemi and she will make sure you leave happy.

Another annoying Scottsdale establishment.   I gave it 2 stars because the food was tasty, not great--but good.  The service on the other hand was horrible at best. The restaurant was freezing!! We requested they shut the back door to prevent the draft of cold air pouring in and was ignored. It was lunch time on a Monday and we were only the 2nd table to be seated, I wasn't sure why our request went ignored.   Shortly after taking our drink order our server vanished for almost 15 minutes. After which did not bring any of us water. We then placed our 2nd, 3rd and 4th request for water and finally receiving it the same time as our entrees. Would you like extra salsa? Too bad, the waitress never was to be seen again till my friend got up and approached the bar to have her soda refilled. It took her this long to realized we were annoyed. The food could have been the most amazing thing ever, but due to the lack of service I will NEVER go back.

Don't be taken back by the exterior. Lightform has many options for all price ranges and needs. It's not just the stuffy modern you would expect.  The staff is over the top friendly-but in a genuine-real way. I walked in unsure of what to expect and was greeted by the sweetest dog and staff. They worked within my budget and went over and beyond to work with me. The customer service is unreal and what I wish more businesses would adopt. Skip ikea, Home Depot and Lowe's, this place is a local gem and a must.

This is my new FAV place in Phoenix. The food is amazing, and for those of you who miss Fiamma (The James) you can have it back with this great little joint. The food is all hand crafted and has flavors you wouldn't believe. Try the duck club and you will be come addicted after the first bite. The bread pudding is to die for--and do not dare leave without trying one of their "muddled" specials. FRESH kiwi with vodka, YUMO!

Great little store to find a cute dress or a great basic for an even better price. Eileen works the store herself and has a spunky personality and fun style. I never leave under $80, and that is with a bag full of stuff. It is a must see for all Arcadia residents!

Super annoying staff! It's such a shame that the mecca of booze in central phx is cluttered with such an obnoxious staff. Never again will I spend a penny there.  My husband and I ran in with literally 5 minutes to spare to find a $50 bottle of wine as a gift for a party we were late for. As soon as we walked in we explained our purpose to the idiot standing by the door and proceeded on our mission. The guy must have not heard the $50 part because he takes us right to a $70 bottle. My husband tasked me to grab a gift bag so I ran off. After 15 minutes I see my husband rush to the register to pay so we can hit the road. The woman working the register asked my ID even though my husband was paying. I explained I was in a hurry and left my bag in the car, but would run and get it if she could start ringing my husband. She refused. That was when it all started to go downhill. I told her that I am almost 30 and if I were some underage punk I would be going for a keg, not a $60 bottle of wine. She continued to insist I had to get my ID first. I felt my whole body heating up and my face turning red. The $%^&% called her "manager" over to ask his advice on the matter. Here we go.  This chess club reject who was clearly younger than me came over and started in with this "calm down" bulls&8t. Which really annoyed me because I wasn't even upset at that point, but now I was. Then the 40-year old virgin starts in with that I am not even allowed in the store if I am under 21. Which is great and makes sense. Like bars right? So I asked the idiot if that is the case why not card at the door? He stood there with this annoying blank stare like I was speaking Japanese to him.  So the genius asks me my birthday hoping I was slipped up. Once I responded--all of a sudden my ID was not needed and all was right with the world. I was so angry about his tone and the way I was treated I stormed out and will NEVER return and hope that every single person I know does the same. Safeway has just as good prices if not better.

It was hours before my rehearsal dinner and the day before my wedding. I ran into BCBG like a hot mess hurricane not really knowing what I wanted or needed but I needed something to wear, and needed it in like 20 mins. 2 of the managers were there, I feel awful I don't recall one of their names, but I recall one being Chad. I felt like Julia Roberts in pretty woman. They brought me several options, shoes, accessories, everything. They were incredibly helpful and honest which I appreciated the most. They had me in and out in a flash, and totally stoked on my purchases. I will definitely be back again. Thank you guys!

REALLY friendly, great with the dogs and the prices are comparable to regular groomers. If you are sick of waiting 5 hours to pick up your dog then you are in luck. Not only was she on time, she crank out my two huge mutts in no time. I was shocked to hear the price. It was the SAME we pay at petsmart (wayyy better job than they ever did) without the annoyance of waiting all day to get them. My younger dog is out of control and slightly unbearable at times and she handled him with a smile. I plan to use this service on a regular basis and suggest you all do too!

As far as nail salons in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area go, finally someone got it right. After an unsuccessful run as Charlies Nails, it was remodeled and reopened as ken's nails and what a transformation. The nail area is very clean and all of the techs are professional and do not spend the entire time blabbing to each other, they actually pay attention to you. The prices are reasonable and my nails always last a full 2 weeks. You must try the gel manicure it lasts forever and looks awesome!  Thumbs up to Ken's!

Yahoooo! Finally a store staffed with friendly and knowledgeable people. It's like I died and went to tile heaven. I was very excited to hear a location was opening in central Phx, and even more pleased after visiting the store. My former contractor (had to give him the boot) didn't measure my showers correctly and I was short about a 1/4 of my master shower on tile, which only the Phx location seemed to have in stock. Problem: they weren't open yet. After a desperate plea to the Tempe store, the store manager, Heather called me from the Phx store. Heather was quick to pull what i needed and allowed me to go purchase it in the middle of setting up for their opening. I'm really thankful for heather and her staff and won't go anywhere else!

Great wine selection and delicious tapas, and a block from my work!!? Yes! Cor winebar is my new favorite spot. The staff is over the top friendly and just fun. The wine selection is GREAT and reasonably priced, decor, trendy, yet classic and clean. The tapas is delicious and absolutely high quality. Alan is a great bartender and makes the experience amazing. I sometimes stroll in by myself and Alan always makes sure I have what I need and makes it a point to make me feel welcomed.  Ray, is just fun and goes out of his way to ensure everyone is happy with their food and drinks. If you are looking for something new, unique and just great, check this new neighborhood gem out. Also, if you add them on Facebook, you can see their live entertainment schedule.
