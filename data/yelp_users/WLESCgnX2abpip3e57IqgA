This place never fails me! The subs are always great, and the best for munchies if you know what I mean! The staff is always chill and very informative on different subs and what's popular, if your looking for a good bang for your buck, this is the spot!

Classic diner style meals, the burger was good, toasted bun, juicy burgers along with some bomb fries, what more could you ask for. Food was cheap and the pies were on point! Not bad for a small burger joint!

The pizza at this place really lived up to all the hype I've been hearing and reading about. I thought they cooked it in some old school stone pizza oven with a fire burning but it was just toasted and cooked through a conveyor belt oven. Oh well, it was good either way. I thought it was going to be too upscale going in but nope, the ambience this place had was pretty casual. Just glad my first time wasn't a disappointment.

The food was well cooked, crab legs, sushi, chicken cooked in like several different ways and the best part they've got a food bar that caters island BBQ if your into that sort of taste and the service was great! By far the best buffet I've been too in AZ with well cooked selections of food. It is a bit pricey so make sure you make your money's worth!

I don't know what happened to this place but I ate dinner here with some friends and the short ribs seemed so under cooked, sushi bar had flies buzzin' around it, and the service room for ever to take away the plates that we finished, they need to figure something out because  the money's ain't worth it anymore. Poor service and disgusting food!

Foods always good! Waitresses are nice, and it's clean! Never had a prob with this spot! Really good atmosphere area, great for groups, classical music always playing in the background. Definitely one of my never fail me spots when you can't figure out where to eat.

They'd be good if they wouldn't be so stingy about their servings, I ordered a chicken katsu plate and they only gave me 6 strips? Really!? It was over priced for a snack size meal, some kind of business. Seriously no Aloha at all....don't eat here! If you've lived at Hawaii, and had Yummys Korean BBQ, these guys are like a bootleg version of them, shit I shouldn't even have given them a star they're that bad! And the ladies asking if I'm from another Hawaiian BBQ spot!? Seriously?! Honestly! Don't waste your money!

Im not an expert on traditional Italian, but the food was great at this place. The owners Mike and Toni were very welcoming on my first visit, very New York Italian like atmosphere, it doesn't get any better. It's a pretty nice experience, and it really makes the food taste even better when the service is top notch! Definitely will be visiting again soon!

The tortas a must! The service was fast and the food was good! Not too spicy but enough to give it a good kick! I got some tongue and head tacos which was pretty good, and a chicken torta. I have to say it was better than what I was expecting. Best of all, it was affordable!

They don't give you a choice of 2-3 things to choose for your takeout plate and the plates are small so you get a small plate of one choice with a little rice box, but the food ain't too bad, just expected a little more

Now I have to say, it ain't good if it ain't attracting Asians, and this place was flocking with Asians. The food was really delicious. I don't really see a flaw about it, it was clean, the staff was nice and the food, well my food was ready in 15 minutes just like they said, and it was great! Fresh hot! And the Tupperware is a plus! Don't throw it away, you can reuse it in the near future. Good bang for your buck and I ordered for pick up and they packed it very securely in a brown paper bag, very presentable. Yeah I'll definitely be coming back here every time I get the chance.

If you love yourself, don't do it. If you don't love yourself than you better hope your insurance covers for major major diarrhea after eating here.

This place is great! The pizzas are always made fresh! Fresh ingredients and great service! And it's always clean! That's a plus plus, cheap and affordable, made fresh every time. The staff is also very informative on what certain ingredients are and how they taste, and they have local brewery beers on hand that are affordable as well. I try to eat here as much as possible! It's a five star in my book!
