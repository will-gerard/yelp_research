Wow! The food is great.  I am in love with the Calzone here, but I've had a number of other things in the past and have never been displeased.  In addition, these guys have a beer selection that rivals most grocery stores.

Best house Margarita in town!  I like them on the rocks, but the bartenders here always tell me the frozen ones are stronger.  Anyway, if you go in during happy hour, go nuts on the appetizers because they're all cheaper.  I would have to recommend the tostada bites and the pot-stickers.

I went here a few weeks ago on a Friday night after I got off of work.  I guess I should start by saying that the only reason I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 is because Rula Bula covered my friends tab the next day when he went back to settle the situation.  My friends and I had been there for about an hour before it was time for last call.  One of my friends had opened a tab, and upon attempting to pay it and retrieve his card, he was told that the system was down and that he was going to have to wait until the following morning to get his card back.  In fact, there were about 10 people still waiting at the back bar by 230 who were trying to pay their tabs and get cards back.  I had cash on me and even offered to PAY MY FRIEND'S TAB AND EVEN LEAVE A TIP, just so we could get his card back and go home!!  Then, when I explained to the manager that it was illegal for him to hold my friend's card over night, he said "Thank you inquisitor" and told me he didn't need a lesson in the law!  Then when I told him I did not think it was befitting of a manager to talk to a customer in his establishment that way he just dismissed me as drunk and walked off in huff and went back in the building!  At that point, an employee who was still out by the back bar even suggested that my friends and I go get a police officer to settle the issue!  I work down the street from these guys and I would never want to bring the cops into someones place like that.  However,  I can honestly say that it is because of my experience with the manager that night at Rula that I even created this Yelp account.  I will never go to that bar again.  If you want a good pub setting with a good staff go to Casey Moore's on Ash just off of University.

If you have not tried the Moo Shu Pork, you are really missing out!  I have been to this place  on a number of occasions and always left wishing I had a bigger appetite.  Every time I have been there, the service is impeccable!  This is my favorite place in town to go for Chinese food.

I love this place so much that I was tempted to give them only 1 star so that hopefully people would read this and not go there so it would be easier for me to find a table!!  All joking aside, this is my favorite bar in Arizona.  Plus, I think it is the only place near Mill Avenue where you can get  Smithwicks on tap and not be in a club setting.  I love the fried Zucchini and Mushrooms too, you never see that anywhere!

I've eaten in here a few times, but most of my experience with this place is through take out.  I am a sucker for good panang curry and that will keep me coming back to this place on a regular basis!  Wow, if these guys delivered I would be in serious trouble!

Wow!!  I am about to move out of town and my roomate LOSES MY ONLY CAR KEY!!  AHHH!!  As if there is not enough other stuff to worry about before leaving but now I have to deal with this!!  Then, she called Lockaid, and not only was I back in my car in a jiffy, but in the meantime, I had such a great conversation with Gabriel that by the time he was done, I had an entirely different look on my day!  Seriously, if you are in a pinch, this is the place to go, top notch!!

Seriously one of my favorite places to eat anywhere in the valley!  Try the Samosas, they are kind of addicting.
