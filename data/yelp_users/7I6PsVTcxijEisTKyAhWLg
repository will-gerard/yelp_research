I discovered this place while living in Phoenix. And now it's a staple every time I'm back for a visit. In fact, it's the only place my girl's and I go for brunch when I'm back. There's not a bad word I could think to say about this place.   I love sitting out on the patio during the summer and sipping one of their Mimosas. Nothing bad about it.

Horrible service and my food was cold. If they had been busy, I MIGHT understand, seeing as I used to be a server myself. But we were the only people in the place. And considering that I've had such great experiences at other King's locations, I was very disappointed.

So good. so good. so good  the only thing that was bothersome was how long it took for our food to arrive. But once it got there, i shut up and enjoyed my yummy breakfast. :)

I love this hotel. I can't say enough good things about it and the people who work there. I was traveling out there on a fairly regular basis for awhile and always stayed at this hotel, and never once did i have a problem. After my 3rd stay the staff remembered me as if they saw me everyday and were always incredibly accommodating. My flight got cancelled due to weather conditions once and they let me stay another day and even gave me half off to try to make me feel better. And it did.  I didnt spend much time in the bar/lounge area but everytime i walked through it seemed pretty lively. A few time they even had live music and i was bummed that i couldnt stay and join in on the fun.   I wish they had an aloft near where i lived because i  just might be tempted to book a couple staycations every now and again, thats how much i like the place.
