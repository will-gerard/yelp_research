O.K.  So my first experience with Ulta was ok.  I went in with a coupon that I got in their weeky mailing for a discount on their hair service.  I got some accent highlight on my long, brunette hair for the holidays.  I asked for small shimmery highlights and got what I asked for.  Happy.  Price was good, job was done right.  Next visit was for root retouch to keep the highlights for another season, this time was different.  I got a different person, because my previous girl had quit.  The lady was friendly and had a touching story, but her highlights were heavier than I'd asked for, and now they're sort of ghetto looking, to the point where I dont want to flat iron my wavy hair in fright that they are going to look like streamers hanging from the top of my head.  Ugh.  Im going to wear them as best as I can for now and then cover them up with dark color, done at a different salon for sure, then take another 5 years to regrow my hair sans any artificial hair color.  Also I was quoted $120 and walked out pissed that I dished out $170 for some linguini highlights when I asked for angel hair or thinner accents.   One plus...I took my younger 14 year old sister with me, and I figured she should take her DS or a book to entertain herself while I was being done up.  They had an Exuviance brand facial session that was free so I signer her up against her will, the poor soul, but she ended up spending the two hours with the ladies, and walked out with a series of freebies and about $65 in product purchases, and a glowy face!  She was a happy camper and that helped me deal with the frustration of overpaying for my services.   I suppose I recommend this for someone who is visiting to purchase hair products, just not services.

Was not greeted or assisted when I came in. The place is disorderly and dirty looking. Finally when I figured things out on my own I waited for the ladies to finish their conversation about whatever trivial weekend blunder they were talking about. Kimberly was the raised eyebrow, gum chewing teller indifferent to the clients needs. She input the information from my sheet, and tried to tell me that if the recipient is not there upon first delivery, UPS sends it back to the sender and that I should get additional services added.  I'm no shipping pro but obviously they take it back to the nearest UPS store and leave a note at the door.  I then said that I was ok without extra services and said "I don't care how it gets there as long as it actually gets there" in a friendly way. She then half rolled her eyes and smirked and said "I don't care either" in a smart a** way.  Her smart attitude was a turn off considering I'm usually patient with lazy service people. All In all I do not recommend this store I don't feel trustful or secure in sending my important document with them, I'm afraid it could get lost now- I checked the status I my shipment using the tracking number and it says its not available.  Don't recommend, find another location to ship from. :)

Zero stars. Close early and are not accommodating to hungry and hopeful pho fans.  This place closes at 8:30pm on a saturday and so I called in "anticipation" at 8:00p to my surprise they told me not to come in because they were closing!!  I was so upset! Still am!! I dont recommend this place because of some very terrible customer service.  Hmph!

This is my boyfriends regular spot.  When I was approaching Bailey's for the first time, I was oh hell here goes a crumbly dive bar complete with raggedy cougars, mustaches and beer guts all along the bar.  To my surprise, it is a pretty cool neighborhood spot to get some drinks on the cheap, the margaritas by Clay are great, stiff but not too strong.  Friendly bar staff, wait staff could be quicker, more outgoing, they're "aiight" thoough, lol.  The crowd varies with the day and time, yes there are the beer belly's and the nascar hats being proudly worn, but some evenings they play top 40's and the crowd is younger, and a notch or two better looking.  At this come as you are bar, people seem to have a good time shooting pool and having some belly laughs with friends.  Again, drinks are way cheap and that helps a ton for a fridays night out or pre-drinking on a sat night to get the party started.  It feels like going to Mulligans in Scottsdale, but for a lesser dime and a mile less pretentious.

Good job to Ticoz and their delicious drinks and food!  I've been there twice, and both times I was very pleased with their super loungy chic decor, sexy staff (Michael) and the beautiful wilst delicious mojito he served me!  It was tall, strong enough to get a happy lighthearted buzz, and tangy sweet! Loved it!  The price is fair, and the service is excellent!  The smiling, good looking staff make it a great place to chit chat with friends, and spend a happy evening hanging out.

From a Mexican girl, who adores exploring all that Mexican cuisine has to offer, I felt as though this place was an excellent place to experience Mexican cuisine.  I went with my brother and his super fun girlfriend one night and had a very nice evening!  What stood out to me was the kind of food they had to offer.  The regional reach this restaurant has was very gratifying being that in my family road trip travels through along the eastern coast of Mexico to our destination, and my birthplace, Veracruz their nostalgia laden menu stirred me inside.  What was particularly satisfying was the fact that they had some dishes like the fried plantanes (platanos machos) with the sticky sweet condensed sweetened milk to compliment the caramelized fruit.  They also had "frijoles rancheros" or ranch style beans, a black bean soup dish that is starchy and satisfying and brought me back to times of being served the frijoles rancheros by my abuelita, may she R.I.P.  The decor was very nice, and so were the wait staff.  I really enjoyed this place and I have a very soft spot for it in my heart because of the type of regional dishes they serve and their ability to bring my memories of childhood dish delights to my current self.

Great service.  I didnt feel like they were trying to rip me off :)  The guys were friendly and helped a damzel in distress when I had no other resource.   They really were great, I definitely recomend.

I mean, wierd. It looks closed from the outside. For a newbie, it took a little too long to get acknowledged but whatever, no bigs. They went through the concept of it, I guess the deal is you get two drinks with your purchase a shot of some Aloe Herbalife solution that's supposed to make you healthy (energy shot?) - You can do the shot straight or in a 12 oz iced tea.  Your second drink is a shake, pick your flavor they have about 20 if I recall.  No real fruit smoothies, no milk, or milk alternative ingredients, just water and their Herbalife powders.   I got the cake batter which turns out is the vanilla and the cookies & cream powders combined. $6, two drinks. It was yummy :). There are tables and a weird lounge area. Seems they have a bunch of regulars. Who knows. Will I come back?  If I'm in a "stick up my ass, skinny bitch mode" looking for a liquid lunch, meh- sure.   I do think one's better off just buying your Herbalife powders and packing a shaker for the office. Odd concept, whatevs Herbalife shake, $3 "healthy aloe shot" tea end a $3 Herbalife shake. Idk....
