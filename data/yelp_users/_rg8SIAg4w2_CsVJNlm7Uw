It's always hard to try out a new Chinese place but tonight we decided to take a gamble and ordered take out. The kids and I tried out the dinner combinations (orange chicken & sweet and sour pork) that also came with fried rice, lo mein, an egg roll and crab puffs. The portion size was huge!! The food was good for the price and amount given. We all kind of wondered where the crab was in the crab puff but it was a good fried wonton with cream cheese inside. My SO ordered the orange chicken dinner which came with steamed rice. It was just about the same price but nearly as much food. He was drooling over the rest of our plates and he is the only one who does not have any leftovers. I'm sure we will order again only next time I think we will try the delivery service.

I really loved this place. As a country girl at heart, I loved the band and that I was able to dance with my honey. It was also cute to see the families out dancing too. The food was good. I had the prime rib which was good. The horse radish was super hot! My husbands ribeye was delish but my daughter swears that the beef ribs were the best she has ever had. There is a beautiful view and I can see why this place is so popular. I am already looking forward to our next visit.

My nieces and nephew are in town visiting so we decided out take them out for a night to remember. Rustlers Roost once again did not disappoint. From the moment we started up the hill to the restaurant they were excited. They loved seeing the bull outside and the cave like entry.  My niece looked like her eyes were going to pop out when the giant bowl of Mac & Cheese was put down in front of her.  The highlight of the night was our visit to the dance floor to listen to the band and do a little dancing. The guys in the band do a great job interacting with the kids and really made their night by giving my niece their autograph.  The reason for 4 stars this visit is because I think the food has gone down a little since our last visit although the beef ribs were  still good. Regardless, we will definitely be back for the view and the band.

My company held a conference here. The hotel is small and quaint and every room is a suite. A nice living room and a nice size bedroom with a comfy bed. The conference area is nice and worked well for us. I have also attended another conference here in the past that was great. There is only 1 restaurant on site and it was just ok. The pool area is small compared to some of the other resorts in the area. There is a free shuttle service to area attractions and restaurants within 5 miles (I think). It's a nice place overall especially if you are looking for a larger room.

Went in for breakfast. We were sat pretty quickly but no one came to our table for about 10 minutes. Apparently no one was sure who's section we were in. The food was ok, definitely nothing to get excited about. I had to ask for a glass of water 4 times before they brought it.  We have had a decent dinner there before and may go back for that sometime but for breakfast there are much better places in town.

We often go to enjoy the happy hour specials, but even the 2 for $20 meal deal is good. Free chips and salsa and good cold beer keep us coming back. The only issue I had on most recent visit was because I ordered a house margarita that tasted awful. So bad in fact I could not finish it...that must be bad! We love the Texas Cheese Fries and the chips are delish. Next time I will be sticking to the ice cold beer!

Still being fairly new to the area we were not sure where to turn when we had a tire issue. Our son got a nail in his tire and needed a repair. We called and they told him to come on in and they would repair it at no charge. Once he got there it turned out that whoever had the car before him had a crappy patch job done and they were not able to fix it. The team at the tire shop went out of their way to help him get a new tire that he could afford. They even allowed him to come back and pay the next day which is unheard of anymore. Their prices and super competitive and their customer service was awesome. Happy to have found our go to tire place.

My most recent visit reminded me to always go with my instincts They came out and inspected my tires and I was told that I definitely needed two rear tires but that my front tires were still in good shape. Something just didn't feel right to me plus I knew I had seen better prices so I left.  With the knowledge that my tires weren't in horrible shape I decided that maybe I just needed an alignment because there was a shake when driving. I went to another tire shop that is open on Sunday. After explaining what was going on they checked my tires and found that 3 of the 4 on the car were separating-the kicker the two front tires were in the worst condition. I was shocked when I felt the inside of the tire because I could feel the separation. Keep in mind that yesterday at discount tire they had me turn the wheel so they could inspect both front tires. WTH? If I would have replaced my two rear tires I could have easily had a blow out on either front tire. I appreciate what discount tire did for my son (in my last review) but my families safety is more important so because of this I will not be returning.

We went in a few weeks ago with friends from out of state because we really love the food. It was a super busy Friday evening. We sat in the bar and our server was taking care of a lot of tables so we were ok waiting a little longer than normal to order our first drinks. The issues came in when we had to continue waiting. Then our food got mixed up. Burritos went to one person instead of enchiladas but we were halfway through before we noticed. We just thought the burritos got smaller.  We mentioned this to our server and she said let me talk to the manager and see what we can do. The manager then came over to our table and asked what the problem was. We explained and he said "So what do you want me to do about it?"  Really? He then told us that he looked at us several times while we were eating and we "looked happy". He argued with us for a bit until I told him to leave the table. I think what upset me the most was his attitude and that he acted like we were just trying to get a free meal or something.  He did end up giving everyone a discount but when he brought the check over he said since you are mad at me here is the number to call and complain. ??? What a baby.  NO we won't be back. Too bad because the food and service are usually good but I have no desire to deal with him again. Maybe he should go take a course i how to behave like an adult.

Being new to pool care we were really struggling with the decision of trying to maintain the pool ourselves or to hire someone. We decided we would give it a shot first and if things don't work out we will hire someone. Maintaining the pool during the cool winter months was pretty easy, but we knew that the warmer months will be a different story. We decided to take a water sample in and have it analyzed. The staff in the store were very helpful and gave us a ton of great information including explaining how to clean the main filters. We bought the suggested supplies, cleaned the filter and added some Ultra Bright to our pool and it looks fabulous! I can't stop looking at the beautiful blue water. I know that we will definitely be returning on a regular basis for our chemicals and a little advice.

After visiting several tire places we found that we got the best deal with the best service here. They did not try to pressure us into getting anything extra but gave us suggestions making it clear that was what they were. I recently returned for an oil change and they did a great job. Again they made suggestions but I did not feel any pressure. I knew going in that I had a small oil leak and the repair quote was very reasonable with no pressure to do it right now. I will definitely be returning to have that work done on my car as well as the next time I need tires.

We first stopped into Arrowhead a couple weekends ago. My hubby knew he wanted a Harley, but we were not sure what model. We met Tanya and Stacy on the sales floor. They were both great answering all our questions (we had a lot!) Luckily for us they were having demo days the next weekend where we were able to ride the different models to help us pick exactly what we wanted.  Demo days was awesome! It's a good thing to because we pretty much spent the whole weekend there. Neither of us felt any kind of pressure to buy and the entire staff went above and beyond to get us financed and into the exact bike we wanted.  Thankfully this process was much different from our first motorcycle purchase experience.Through the entire process both Tanya and Stacy were there to help with anything we needed. I honestly feel like everyone working there was just as excited as we were when we finished the deal. We feel like we have a new family. If you are in the market for a new motorcycle you have to stop in and talk to the staff at Arrowhead Harley. They are great and the showroom is beautiful. That being said..Let's ride!

Over the weekend we went to another dealership for a "party". While we were there we looked at the new bikes available for sale. We found the same exact bike we bought earlier this year at Arrowhead. It had a giant sticker on it that said reduced $1000! When we looked at the price the marked down price was almost $2000 more than we paid at Arrowhead. So we got a better price and great customer service. Sounds like a win to me!  A friend of our recently purchased a new bike and he had the same experience we did. He was impressed with the fact that when he wanted to see the bike in the sun no one hesitated to roll the bike outside for him to see. Our sales guy Stacy is always available for questions.  If you are seriously looking to buy a Harley you really need to go look at the prices at Arrowhead. Between that and the customer service you won't be sorry.

We had the pleasure of visiting last night to watch Love, Loss & What I Wore. This was my first visit to this theatre and I was impressed. The main entrance is actually off the street and very nice. The lobby is contemporary with plenty of seating and a cute little gift shop. They were extremely well organized at the ticket booth and the refreshment area. I liked the fact that we could take our wine into the show with us as long as it had a lid on that they provided. As for our seats even though we were up toward the top we had a great view. This is definitely the type of place where you can say there is not a bad seat in the house.

This was our first visit to Tempe Improv and we had an absolute blast. All of the comedians were really funny. We got there early and ended up with great front row seats although I doubt there is a bad seat in the house. The staff was super friendly and funny but the drinks were horrible and extremely expensive!!! If I were rating on drinks alone I would give 1 star-zero if I could. $17 for a double Cuervo margarita? Oh and did I mention They did not even taste like they contained alcohol? No thanks. I will never order another drink like that there. Maybe I would check into the bottle service they have next time or order beer or wine.  That being said, I would go back because of how much fun we had I would just be smart enough not to fall for the waiters- It will be a "good" drink line again.

I am pretty disappointed in the quality of the service I got. I paid $15.99 which was supposed to include vacuuming and a light dusting plus fragrance inside and bug removal outside. What a joke. The floor mats were partially done and one side put back upside down. I think they maybe wiped the dash only and no fragrance. On the outside bugs galore still on the front bumper. On the plus side my windows and mirrors were really clean. I guess I will continue my search for a good car wash.

Stopped by for a late lunch on the way home from the lake. This place is nothing fancy but they have amazing burgers and ice cold beer. I had a mushroom bacon and Swiss burger. It was great but my husband had the chili burger and the chili was amazing. I would definitely order that next time. It was so flavorful I wanted to steal his burger. The service was fast and friendly.

We stopped in for a bite after a long drive while moving from Oregon to Phoenix. We were super excited to find this little gem where we could order some food and have a drink. We decided to get the Henderson Special which was 5lbs of wings and a Lg pizza. Both were delicious and there was way more then enough food!  The only downside was the service was a little slow, but the place was packed. We will definitely be back on one of our return trips to the area.

We pulled into the Hawthorn after a 14 hour drive during a move from Oregon to Arizona. We chose to stay here because we were traveling with our dog and they had a very reasonable pet fee $10 and parking for our moving truck. When we arrived the guy behind the counter basically said he didn't know where we could park since the parking was all taken so we had to figure that out, but our check in was pretty quick and easy. It was HOT in the halls, but the room was well airconditioned and clean. It definitely did not have any fancy features and if I was traveling without my pet I would have stayed somewhere else, but if worked for what we needed. There is not much within walking distance to eat, but there is a shopping center across the street with some choices.

This was our first visit to Tuscany and we were impressed. We went over the Thanksgiving holiday and for 4 nights paid $200 so I was a little concerned about what the room was going to look like. It reminded me more of a timeshare as far as how the grounds are set up with multiple buildings that are not connected. The room was quite large with a king size bed, couch and chair and a wet bar including a refrigerator (you can request a microwave from the front desk). Plus a large bathroom with a tub and separate shower and enclosed toilet. Everything was clean and nice. The only issue we had was that we were on the 3rd floor and the ice machine was not working so we had to go downstairs to get ice.  When we checked in the front desk staff was quick and friendly. We also had great service from the casino employees.  Unfortunately it was too cold to visit the pool area but it looked nice and cozy. Maybe a little small during busy summer times. Overall if you don't mind a short walk to the strip this is a great place to stay and in sure we will be back.

How is it that this was my first visit here? I had friends come in from out of town who were staying downtown so we decided to try this place out. It was a week day so there wasn't a wait. I had the mozzarella salad and it was delicious. The mozzarella is fresh made and probably the best I have ever had. The tomatoes and basil were very fresh and flavorful as well. I would go back just for this salad. Fortunately the pizza was awesome too. Lots of flavor and the ingredients were fresh and delicious. You can just tell. The crust and bread we were served was super good too. I can't wait to go back with my family so they can taste the goodness. The menu at this location is pretty limited so I would like to try their other location too.

We ended up here late on a Saturday night. This was not our first choice (amazing how many restaurants close at 11pm!) I am super glad we ended up here. The burgers were awesome and since I am not a huge burger lover, I was pleasantly surprised. There are several options for the type of meat you want and I went with the hormone free usda beef. It was extremely flavorful. My husband, who loves a good burger, was also impressed. We would both like to return and try another type of meat. The only negative was the service. It wasn't awful but it definitely could have been better. We were sitting 2ft from the bar but it took forever to get a beer after we ordered and our server was just hanging out at the end of the bar talking with co-workers. That is kind of ridiculous. I would still give it another try though the burger was that good.

I was really surprised at how much I liked the Luxor. From reading the reviews it's not somewhere I would have picked to stay but we went with a group and this is where we ended up. The check in went really smooth. I like the option of being able to check in early, even though there is a small fee to do so. If you don't want to pay that fee you can still check in then wait until 3 to get your room which eliminates the huge lines. We were checked in within 15 minutes including standing in line. We stayed in a pyramid king room, which was plenty big enough and had a small table and two chairs plus an oversized chair. The bed was decent enough and after a day of walking around Vegas it felt great when we finally made it to bed. The bathroom and especially the shower was very nice I did pretty well in the casino and all of the employees were very friendly and helpful.  The only negatives I found were the people constantly trying to sell you vacation packages. I don't mind being asked once but geez-you end up just being rude to them by the 10th time they try to get you. The other negative is how far down the strip it is. If you want to go down to Ceasars it's quite a walk.  Overall the room was nice and super quiet which is really important to me. I think we will definitely be back. I would like to stay in the tower next time to see how it compares.

We were in town and were lucky enough to have a friend bring us for Sunday football. The casino was clean and comfortable and with $1.00 beers and hot dogs you really can't go wrong. This is the kind of place that I would like to have down the street from me just to go hang out. I didn't do any gambling so I don't know how they pay out but I would like to come back sometime and give it  a shot.

Since we had such a great time on our last visit watching football when we had the opportunity to stay at the hotel on a Sunday it didn't take long to decide to do it. It was a little difficult to find the hotel entrance as it is completely separate from the casino but once we found it they had free valet parking which was awesome. We were way earlier than the check in time but luckily we were able to check in right away.  The lobby was totally beautiful and grand. Check in went very smoothly and the employee who checked us in was very friendly. We were in the east tower which was a bit of a walk from the hotel lobby but it was closer to the casino. I really liked that you had to use your room key to get into the area where the rooms are. We stayed in a king room and I was impressed at how big the room was. The furnishings were nice and everything was well appointed. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were amazing.  We had dinner at the buffet which was very good. There were a lot of choices and the staff was very friendly.  We wanted to go to the pool or hot tub but we couldn't really figure out when it was open or even if there was a hot tub.  The only thing we were disappointed in were the bars we had so much fun in before. We had a terrible time getting service and all the empty tables had glasses or bottles on them. The staff spent most of the time standing at the end of the bar talking. If I was rating this on that experience alone it would be much lower. Overall we would stay here again with the hopes that those in the bar were having an off day. The comfy bed would make it totally worth it.

We have been to Cave Creek several times and we always drive by and think we should stop in there sometime. Today was the day. We had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to take a bike ride so we headed out to Cave Creek and stopped in for lunch. It was pretty busy and we did have a bit of a wait but we just hung out at the bar while we waited for a table. If there hadn't been such a large group of us I would have just stayed in the bar area. We ended up on the patio which was nice. My hubby and I shared the appetizer sampler platter which was plenty of food for us. I really liked the tamale verde and I think I would order that the next time we go. Everyone in our group liked their food. I would have given 5 stars but the service was super slow!!

We went in during happy hour. The beer was great and we both loved the Hefeweizen with the hint of banana. We tried some of the happy hour foods including the pork & Kobe sliders with garlic fries and the calamari. I absolutely loved the pork sliders. The flavor of the pork with the coleslaw was great. My husband and son really like the beef. The garlic fries were awesome. None of us liked the calamari. The batter was greasy and lacked flavor. I definitely would not order it again. Aside from that everything else was really good and the beer will bring us back for sure.

I would have never thought this place would have such great food! It's in the middle of a casino off strip and we were tired and hungry by the time we arrived. The prices were cheap for Vegas! (3 item combo $13) beers were $3 domestic and $4 for imports. The chips are served with beans and salsa both of which were very good. The chips themselves were great as well. The chile Rellano was amazing and I will definitely return the next time we stay at Tuscany.

I have been wanting to visit this done in theater for quite some time. Today we made our way from Goodyear to Phoenix to check it out. First off when you arrive if you park in the garage just go ahead and take the elevator up because the theater is on top. We made the mistake of going down to the ground level then we had to walk up the escalator stairs since none to the stairs going up were working.  The lady working at the ticket booth was awesome and she helped us figure out what movie to see after the one we were originally going to see was sold out.  She also explained how the whole thing worked. So far so good.  We were early so we sat at the bar and had a drink and appetizer. I ordered a margarita. It was super sour. I had to have them add watermelon purée to it and still couldn't drink it. Later I heard a waiter talk someone out of ordering one. We did a sampler appetizer that was pretty good.  Once we finished that it was time to head into the theater. We found our seats and they were worn out! I had to switch with my husband because the one I sat in originally was so worn out I felt like I was laying down. We ordered a pitcher of beer and popcorn. It took forever to get the beer and even longer to get the popcorn. It was $35 for those two items. I thought it was going to be around $27 but didn't check my receipt to see what they charged. I did hear someone else complaining about being over charged on our way out. When I mentioned it to my son he told me that he did not get all his change after he paid.  I was seriously disappointed with this theater. The seats were not nearly as comfy and the living room theaters and I felt like we got ripped off with the whole dine in thing.  The best part of this experience was sharing a pitcher with my hubby. I doubt we will be back after today's experience.

I have been here several times for lunch and a couple times for breakfast. I really enjoy the sandwiches available for lunch and I often buy some kind of pastry to take to my husband that he really loves. It has been a while since I had breakfast here in the past and I decided to stop in again today. I ordered the Ham & gruyere cheese frittata. I quickly realized that it was the same thing I ordered on my previous breakfast visit. The cheese tasted more like a Brie to me, which Is not my favorite. The potatoes and toast were good. I would probably return for breakfast and try something else. I will definitely come back for lunch because the sandwiches are sooo good.

Who doesn't love Costco? Great products and prices as always. I love that they stand behind their products and will accept returns no questions asked. The only reason I am not giving this location 5 stars is because it does not carry as many items as other locations. I think it's probably because it's a smaller store. All of the employees I have encountered have been very friendly too.

I visited with my husband and son. We all really liked the bean dip and the chips were good too. My son loved the fajitas. My chile Rellano was ok. Not the best one I have had in town but it was acceptable especially since the margaritas were only $3.99 for happy hour. Overall everything was pretty good. I am sure we will be back.

This was my first Nascar experience. Yes it was not just a race it was an experience. Although we only went to the Sprint cup race we met up with friends who were camping in the RV area Saturday night as well. The amount of people camping out amazed me. The camps ranged from simple RV's with chairs outside to elaborate set ups including pool tables and full size dance floors. There were a lot of people having a great time.  As for the race-the venue itself is huge! There was so much going on I am positive that we missed out on a lot because we ran out of time. There was something for just about everyone. Yes the food and drink prices were high but not as much as some of the other sporting venues in the valley. There was also a huge variety of food to choose from.  The race was loud and I was glad I brought ear plugs although they were available for purchase for $2. The seats are bleacher seats but they were pretty roomy so overall we were quite comfortable.  We arrived early and left as soon as the race was over plus we had a parking pass right near the track so traffic was not an issue for us. Although this was our first race I am sure it won't be our last!

We were here to attend a company holiday party. The food was buffet style and consisted of salad, rice with pineapple, carrots, green beans and chicken with a super yummy sauce. After reading some of the food reviews I was pleasantly surprised. We also had access to shuffleboard and pool tables. For the most part the service was very good with the exception of one guy who asked if we wanted change after we paid a $12 bill with a $20...um duh!

I just moved here from Oregon so I was happy to find that Fry's carries my familiar Kroger brand. I've spent a lot of time doing price comparisons and I'm happy to find that Fry's is still a better choice than Wal-Mart.The staff is helpful and friendly too.

I was a little hesitant to go in after reading the other reviews, but I am very glad I did. Not only did we have great service, but the food was very good. I really liked the fact that almost everyone in the place seemed to be a regular. The staff made us feel very welcome and my family agreed that we felt very comfortable there. While the bar is open to the dining room, there are many other restaurants set up the same way and tonight I did not see any issue with it. There are great specials on Tues & Thur nights on wings and beer so I am sure we will be regulars in no time.

Yay! Sephora is finally here!! This is the only reason I decided to return to JcPenney. I was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales. In fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance. I may actually start shopping here again.

This was our first time visiting this theater and it was packed on Saturday night. The concession lines didn't seem that long but they moved pretty slow so I am glad we were early. Once we got into the theater itself we found roomy comfortable seats with plenty of leg room. It did get super warm during the movie but I think it had something to so with the 119 degree day outside. Overall I thought it was a nice place and we will definitely come back.

My uncle was in town visiting and wanted to go to a restaurant that has been featured on Triple D. After a little research we ended up here. I have been by in the past and know this place gets packed so we came in close to when they opened for dinner. We had no wait and were greeted and seated immediately.  It smelled amazing and made me even more hungry! Our server was super friendly and guided us when we asked for ideas on things to order. We started out with the Bruschetta which was amazing. I could have just eaten that and the bread for dinner. Delicious.  We decided to each order an entree and share. We had the Italian Stallion pizza, Pesto Lasagna and the Linguini and clams with white sauce. We all loved everything! The pizza was not the best I have had but it was definitely up there with the best. The Linguini and clams was really good with just enough spice to give it a nice kick at the end. My favorite was the lasagna. It was different and delicious. The creamy pesto sauce was so good I dipped my pizza crust into my bowl to get the last bit of sauce. The lasagna was made up of chicken and cheeses. We enjoyed beer and wine with our dinner and everything was priced appropriately for the portion size. Can't wait to return because I am going to crave that lasagna again very soon.

Tonight was my first visit for Fresh & Easy and I know it won't be my last. I was surprised at the amazing prices on some things. Of course other things were higher priced than at a regular grocery store, but it's close to my house and that alone is worth the visit. The store itself was clean and well stocked with a large variety of products including all the regulars. From what I saw it appeared that there were great prices on the meat as well. Very happy to have this in my neighborhood!

What a fun time we had at Johnny Rockets. The old time malt shop feel is great and the shakes are amazing. We really enjoyed the burgers and fries and I especially like the crisp sweet potato fries. The management staff was very attentive and friendly and the prices were super reasonable especially considering the location in Westgate. We will definitely be back.

I love In-N-Out. I am so happy to have one close by once again. The food is always good and the workers are always pleasant to deal with. I have never run into a rude employee. This location lives up to those high standards. Even when it is busy, which is most of the time, they get you through the line quickly. The food is fresh and delicious. I will always choose In-N-Out over other fast food places because the quality is much better for the same price or even less.

I really wanted this place to be awesome but it was just ok. Maybe it was what we ordered but I didn't think the sushi was better here than some of the other places we tried just more expensive. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad just not worth the higher $. The service was really good and I liked the environment so that is a place compared to some of the other restaurants in town. I would be willing to go back and try this place again for happy hour or for a date night.

I am so glad that we came back to Tomo. I absolutely loved what we had today. The Popcorn Lobster Roll was awesome and is definitely a new favorite. The Spicy Ninja Roll was really good too. It was almost like jalapeño popper sushi, but it worked. The thing I didn't like as much were the monkey balls. Mushrooms stuffed and fried. I have read a lot of reviews where people raved about them but we thought they were just ok. I probably wouldn't order them again myself but obviously from the other reviews people love them. If you have people that don't love sushi they have a lot of other things to choose from. The one downside- I ordered a margarita that was served in a tall glass and tasted like almost pure margarita mix. Guess I will stick to sake next time :)

Wow! Inexpensive car wash plus a free vacuum. I don't see how you can go wrong!

After reading the Yelp reviews I was excited and a little nervous about trying Azure for the first time. It is really only $25 for an hour and that seems so cheap you wonder what kind of experience you are actually going to have. While there are not individual massage rooms, there are bamboo partitions that create a private space. It pretty much goes as others have described with you feet soaking in warm water etc.   Since it was so quiet there was no talking between me and the lady giving the massage Ann so if you want to communicate about the pressue etc I would do it before they take you back. You may want to do this especially if you are worried about pressure etc.  The hour was over way to fast and I think the next time I go I will be adding additional time. I was very relaxed when I left and honestly could have just taken a nap. I agree that for the price this is the best thing out there and I will definitely be back.

We were doing some shopping and decided to get a late lunch. I had the white pizza with tomatoes and the hubby had the red sauce with pepperoni. Both were delicious. I ordered the personal size and hubby had the small. I thought the personal pizza was pretty large and could not finish it. We split the butterscotch toffee cheesecake that was super yummy. The house Pinot Grigio was decent and only $4 a glass. The service was a tad slow but we liked not feeling rushed at the same time. We will definitely be going back.

I was pretty disappointed in the size of this location. It's super small and had a really small selection compared to other BevMo locations I have visited. It's a shame because the staff wes super friendly and helpful. I may come back just because this is closer to my house then Total Wine, but only if I want something very common.

Let me start off by saying that I loved, loved, loved our visit to Flemings! I decided to surprise my husband on his birthday with a visit. It was awesome that from the time we walked in until the time we left they made his night special.  Our server Rory took great care of us and anticipated our needs. He was also extremely helpful with the menu and wine selections.  We both ordered the bone in ribeye which was excellent and cooked to perfection. We shared the Fleming potatoes and sautéed mushrooms and both were fantastic. The bread and spreads that were served before dinner were super good as well.  We will definitely be back hopefully sooner rather than later.

This was our first visit to Paradise Bakery and all I can say is YUM! It was so good, I went back for lunch the next day. The dining room is very pleasant and clean, the service is great and the sandwiches are super yummy. I love having this fairly close to our house!

This review is for the salon. I went in for a cut and color. I am always scared when trying out someplace new but this place is  Close to my house so I wanted to give it a shot. My hairstylist was Janice and let me tell you she is awesome! She listened to what I wanted and knew exactly what I was talking about when I described the color. I also have curly hair that is difficult to cut because I like to wear it both straight and curly. She had no problem with my cut and it looks great either way. I am so happy to have someone so close to me in the west valley who can give me a fantastic cut and color. If you're looking for a hairstylist in the west valley give Janice a shot and you won't be sorry!

Today I decided I wanted to try out some false eyelashes for fun. I went in and explained what I was looking for. I definitely picked the right place because not only did they help me find what I was looking for but I was able to have them applied as well. This was a great service for me since I don't know the first thing about wearing them. I also found out that not only do they do lashes but also eyebrow waxing and tinting too! Fun! The girl who helped me, Tasha was awesome and I could tell she took pride in her work. I can't wait to go back and give the brow wax/ tint a try.

Our visit was during happy hour on a Tuesday where we were surprised to find specials on both beer and and wings. I had the $4 Blue Moon and my husband the $3.75 Coors Light. We also shared some wings. The food was great, the beer was cold and the service was both friendly and attentive. We noticed that there are also $3 bud lights on Sunday! We will definitely be back.

This place has a great happy hour! Lettuce wraps $6? Yes!! The BBQ spare ribs are awesome and so are the crispy green beans!! The service was great and they made sure that we got our order in during happy hour. It is a refreshing change compared to some places that seem to discourage the happy hour menu. We will definitely be back.

For some reason we have not been to OG for a long time and recently we decided to stop in for dinner. Since then we have been back 3 times and each time the food and service has been excellent. The breadsticks at this location are awesome and I really enjoy the selections of appetizers available. If you haven't been in lately you should give it a try and enjoy some yummy treats.

The friendly staff here is what prompted the one star. My breakfast consisted of an on omelette with under cooked hash browns and burned toast. This was my first visit and it would take a lot for me to go back.

I was in the area today at lunch time and decided to stop in to try the food I have read rave reviews about. I arrived just after noon and the place was pretty busy. The line to order reached all the way to the door. The food smelled delicious and made my tummy growl with anticipation. It is always hard to decide what to try first when trying a new restaurant. I went with the enchalada & tamale combo. The wait was pretty short for as busy as it was and the price was right.  I liked the enchalada, the tamale was great but I wasn't wild about the red sauce over everything. The rice and beans were amazing! I wish I would have ordered a couple flour tortillas to go with my meal and I will be returning to give them a try. The burritos people were eating around me looked amazing as well.

Stopped in for lunch on Saturday just before noon. It was busy as usual but not too bad. I had a green corn tamale and my hubby had a #3 combo that included a taco, tostada and enchilada with rice and beans.   There is limited seating so while I was in line he went and found us a seat. It took quite a while for our food to come out. My tamale was good although there was more masa than meat. It did have good flavor though. Hubby really liked everything except the red sauce on the enchilada. It almost tasted like someone dumped a bunch of red chili in the pot and didn't finish cooking it. I would definitely not order anything with that sauce on it again. The beans and rice were very good.

We went in for dinner and endless shrimp. This is only our 2nd visit to this location but its is nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. Jana was out waitress on this visit and she did an excellent job taking care of us. Don't you just love it when your server can anticipate your needs?  The food was good. Hubby had the endless shrimp and loved them all. I had steak and snow crab. The crab was delish but the steak was a little tough. May have been the cut because it was cooked and seasoned well. Overall good food, great service and that made it a wonderful night.

This place is great! On top of the huge selection and great prices on wine, beer and spirits they have complimentary wine tasting on Fri, Sat and Sun. They had many wines to taste which is always helpful when you are hesitant to buy something new. It was a bit overwhelming when we started looking at all the different types of wine they offered and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back.

We were staying at the casino hotel on Sunday night and decided to give the very reasonably priced buffet a try. It was $14.99 with the players club card or $19.99 without. We arrived right as they were starting dinner service and there was no line but within minutes after we were seated a large line had formed. There were many things to choose from including Chinese, Mexican, Prime Rib and Fish. There were also several salads and even sushi. The dessert area was full of delicious offerings and also included ice cream and shakes made to order. The service was fantastic and the food was really good. We would definitely return.

We were looking for something to do on Mother's Day so we opted for a drive. Since I have been wanting to come out here for a while we headed that direction. We had a bit of a drive just to reach the Apache Trail but it wasn't too bad. The road once you past Goldfield becomes very curvy so plan on taking your time and just enjoy the ride. It seemed like around every turn was another "Wow look at that" view. We stopped a few times along the way to enjoy the scenery. When we reached our destination we enjoyed looking in the gift shop that had tons of cool stuff in it. I could have spent way more time, and money, in there than I did. The also have a little general store where you can buy drinks, trinkets and candy as well as ice cream. The ice cream seemed to be very popular. We decided to go ahead and have lunch in the saloon.  The saloon was not too busy although they had a large stack of pagers so I imagine some days there will be a wait. The saloon itself is pretty unique and I thought the saddle bar stools were awesome. The good was reasonable priced and pretty good. I would definitely return again the next time we are out for a drive. It was fun playing tourist for the day

I walked in hoping to be able to get a fill today and I had no problem. It was super busy lots of people getting pedicures. The staff was very friendly and Ann did a great job on my nails. They are shaped perfectly and look like my own nails.  I am so happy I went in and checked this place out. I can't wait to go back and get a pedicure.  As far as the price-I think it seemed pretty average to me. A little more expensive than the cheapest place I have found but its also a lot cleaner which is a plus for me. I will definitely be back.

I have noticed the service going downhill on my last several visits. I continually get nail techs that are not very good and take forever. I usually also come here for my pedicures but after the last one I had which was rushed to the point that she hurt me, I won't be going back. I thought I might continue coming in to get my nails done but I am tired to trying to be friendly to techs that are more concerned with getting you in and out than found a good job. I recently went elsewhere for my pedicure and for only a few dollars more I had a terrific experience. That's where I will be going from now on.

We have ordered pizza to go a couple times from Garden Pizza and have enjoyed it, but recently we decided to stop in for dinner. I have a whole new opinion of the place since then. I really enjoyed the staff who were extremely welcoming to us and all of the patrons they interacted with. We ordered a large meat pizza which was huge! My husband can eat pizza so I was shocked when we had several pieces left. We were also happy to see the pizza and wing combos that are available. I ordered a glass of wine which turned out to be a mug of wine (did I mention I love this place) for $3.50. It's close to our house and an amazing local business. They also have awesome salads. We will definitely be back!

This place is crazy busy at breakfast time. It's located upstairs in the Linq casino and the waiting area was bursting at the seams. One downfall here is that they only use a PA system to call you to your table so you are stuck waiting in all that chaos. I think our wait was well over an hour. They have a Bloody Mary bar set up in the waiting area which would have been great if it was properly staffed. Service was super slow.   Once we were seated things moved along pretty quickly. I ordered the BLT Bloody Mary but when they brought it there was no bacon. The server ended up bringing me a piece of bacon wrapped in a napkin. Sort of took away from the whole experience. On top of everything It was not the best Bloody Mary I have had.   The food was really good. The portions were huge! We had to try the signature sage chicken Benedict. It was very unique and tasted great. I really loved the mashed potatoes. I would return but I would try to come at a less popular time or try the off strip location.

This place is awesome! I hate going to the dentist, but love getting my teeth cleaned so I am very particular about who I trust with my dental care. I have had a really hard time finding a place that I felt comfortable with since moving to Arizona. Luckily I heard about G Dental from a friend and finally got in.  Everything about this place rocks. From making the appointment with Erica-who is super friendly- to the exam. Tammy took great care of me during both the exam and later cleaning of my teeth. She made me feel completely relaxed and confident about the care I was getting. She also has a great sense of humor which always makes the time go by faster.  Dr G is great too! He really took time to talk to me about my teeth and treatment plan. Plus he just has a demeanor about him that relaxed me and made me feel like I was in good care.  On top of the great staff the office is beautiful. I really did feel more like I was going for a massage than dental work. I am so happy to have found a place to keep my choppers tuned up.  If you are looking for a dentist-seriously give them a call. I think you will be happy you did. I know I am.

We had a great time at the Diamondbacks game! Not only are the tickets far more reasonably priced than other stadiums in have been to, the value continues on to the concessions. $1.50 for a hot dog? $4 for a beer? Not to mention great prices on t-shirts and hats ($9.99). We sat in the club terrace where we had an awesome view, comfy padded seats and in seat ordering. I can't wait for our next visit!

Being new to the area we decided to give Gordas a try. The whole family was glad we did. I ordered a couple tacos one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were delicious. I especially enjoyed the carnitas but both were delicious. My husband and son both had burritos and after seeing them it left me wishing I had ordered one myself even if they were big (lunch for the next day). My daughter loved the enchilada plate that came with rice and beans. There were many different types of salsa in the salsa bar and the restaurant was clean and well decorated. I only wish we could have enjoyed our meal with a beer. We will definitely be back though the food was that good.

On New Years Day we decided to have a girls day and go get a pedicure. Since we just moved to the area from rainy Portland, we were excited that we could actually be wearing sandals in January..yeah maybe it is a little cold but the sun was shining.  My daughter, mom and I headed out to Laveen Nail. When we entered we were delighted to see that the place had more of a spa feel than a typical nail salon. We picked out our polish from their large selection of colors and we were able to get started right away.  I was happy that they used plastic inserts in the foot tub which made me feel better about the cleanliness of the place. When the nail tech came over she presented me with a menu of choices to choose from. I went with the Laveen Spa Pedicure which included callous removed and a scrub.  I am going to say that this was probably one of the best pedicures I have ever had. The massage was great on top of everything else. They finished it off with a great paint job including some cute flowers. We will definitely be back.

We recently joined Life Time and so far we love it! Sure it is a little more expensive than some of the other gym's available, but I like having everything available to me in one spot. Not to mention because of the raquetball, rock climbing wall, spa and cafe this is somewhere my family can come hang out on the weekends and be active. I am also looking forward to the weather warming up so we can hang by the pool and even enjoy the outdoor cafe.  There are plenty of cardio machines to choose from as well as weights, classes and activites. If you can't find something you like to do here you are not looking very hard.  They have some great benefits that come with your membership if you just ask around and definitely do not be afraid to talk with the trainers. I just started working with a trainer for the first time and I am excited about what is ahead of me!!  Stop by and take a tour-we did not get the high pressure sales pitch here like we did at LA Fitness and the facility is far better!

After many months of hearing how delicious Chick-fil-A is I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. Since I have never been here before I bought a regular chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and some waffle fries for my son and I to share so we could try a variety of things.  The service in the drive thru was friendly and quick. I was in and out in no time. The food on the other had left a lot to be desired. To me the fries were a little undercooked but still decent. The chicken nuggets were cooked pretty good and seasoned well. The chicken sandwich was so dry I could barely gag it down. Even after adding some sauce to it, it was still dry. Bottom line it was ok. Nothing I would drive far to get because honestly I could go to Carl's JR and get a better chicken sandwich right by my house. Maybe I expected to much because of how everyone raves about it. I probably won't be back.

This morning we passed TJ's and decided to stop in for breakfast. We arrived at just the right time to take the last two seats at the counter. There were a lot of choices on the menu and I decided on the farmer omelette with hash browns and toast. My hubby went for the chili omelette with biscuits and gravy. The portion size on my meal was great and on his it was huge! The food was very good but the standouts were the chili and the biscuits and gravy. I think I will be dreaming about the biscuits and I am not even a huge biscuit lover. The people next to us order French toast and eggs, and an omelette with pancakes. Again very generous portions. I would love to try the French toast that is made from homemade bread. Also homemade are all of the breads, buns, biscuits etc and the pies. All of this and a friendly staff. We will definitely be back so I can get my biscuit fix.

Food is still ok but the fact that I can't order food the way I want it is ridiculous. That and the fact I have witnessed management berate the wait staff in front of customers makes me not plan to return.

We stopped in while we were out for a motorcycle ride. I wasn't really sure what to expect but we were happy when we got our food. We had pepperoni and half black olive, half green olive. The pizza was great and the crust was delicious. I also saw a tray of wings go by that looked fantastic and made me wish I would have taken advantage of the special. (X-large pizza and wings $26)   The price was right too! Just over $22 for 4 of us to eat. Sure beats Micky D's that shares the parking lot. I am looking forward to trying the location closer to home.

DO NOT EAT HERE!! The only reason I am giving one star is because I can't give 0. We recently moved to the area and wanted to find a good Mexican restaurant. When we first walked in I thought it might be decent. The special drink was a 24oz margarita for 9.99. The decor was colorful and festive but as we approached our seats I noticed that they were ripped and warn looking. My hubby and I ordered the special margaritas and a bowl of guacamole that was $7.00. We were served free chips, salsa and spicy bean dip. I wanted to order a chile Rellano but they are made with Hatch chiles and super hot so I went with the taco platter with shredded beef. My son ordered the chile verde and my husband ordered a ground beef chimichanga. Both my husbands and mine were super greasy. In fact I could squeeze the grease out of the taco. My sons chile verde was spicy but ok. A small portion made to look bit by sitting on top of green goo and pork fat. Basically we all hated this food. I have never given such a low rating before. To top it off our bill for 3 people was $79. That's dinner for 3 and 2 Margaritas. My son had water. I don't mind paying for good food but this is anything but. I will never ever ever set foot in this or another Arriba grill again. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Rubio's where you will get much better quality good for a way better price. Oh and did I mention I hated this place??  On a side note the only bright part of this visit was the excellent service.

When we were driving around Goodyear to see if we wanted to move here my husband spotted this Papa Murphy's and decided right then and there that this was the place to be lol. Last night we decided to give it a try and were delighted to find the good ol pizza we are used to plus a few new ones at the same great price. Since we have tend to have pizza about once a week I am sure we will be back regularly.

I am always afraid to try out new Sushi restaurants, but thanks to a recommendation from a friend and some good Yelp reviews I decided to give Ah Hai a try. My son and I are the only ones in our family who like sushi so I persuaded him to come to lunch with me today since I had a Val-Pak coupon for 50% off a second lunch bento box.  I really enjoyed the miso and salad that started off our meal. My only suggestion is maybe to order the dressing on the side since there was a pretty fair amount on there even though it was delicious. The bento lunch itself was pretty large and everything tasted very good and the California rolls tasted very fresh. In fact I can't wait to go back and try some of the rolls. They have a great happy hour as well and since this place is right around the corner from my house I am sure I will be back to give it a try.

Stopped in here with a group of 5 friends during bike night. First the positives: The pizza was actually pretty good. We also had wings that were decent. Another in our group ordered a philly cheesesteak sandwich that looked yummy. Our service was good. We were actually enjoying our evening and food then came the bad: the check  My husband and I ordered the special which was $22 and change plus he had a soda to drink. Our bill was $35. Why you ask? Because the tip 18% was automatically added to the bill. I asked the manager why the tip was automatically added thinking it may be because we asked for the check to be split. She informed me that they automatically add the tip to groups of 6 or more. Our server then said "Oh, I thought it was 5 or more". Well her loss because I would have tipped more than their automatic tip but I hate being forced to tip especially without any advanced warning (like something printed on the menu). \  Bottom line-there are other choices in this area and we will definitely be going to those before I come back here. If you visit with 6 or more people either go somewhere else or don't sit together!

We stopped in for an early lunch. The place was empty when we arrived but by the time we left all of the tables were full and that was well before lunch. Shortly after we ordered we were brought chips that had a small amount of  beans on them. They were good. I ordered the carnitas street tacos and my son had the green chile burrito. Everything was really tasty. I especially enjoyed the salsa that was brought out with the chips. There was a salsa bar with several other choices as well that I would like to try on our next visit.

We went to the late show and were first in line because we were early. Parking was a little challenging and most of the stuff around was closed export some of the restaurant/bars. We had already eaten so we went ahead and got in line. By the time they let us in the line stretched out and around the corner so if you want to sit up close you might want to get there early.   Our server was quick to get us our drinks and checked on us regularly. Probably the only negative is that everyone is packed in and it felt like servers were constantly squeezing between tables which was kind of distracting. There is a two drink minimum and I debated on what to order. I took a chance and ordered my favorite a dirty martini and it was really good. The show was great and everything ran very smoothly. I would definitely come back but instead of having dinner elsewhere I would check out the copper blues restaurant next door. It looked awesome.

After driving by many times we decided to stop in for lunch. The place was pretty busy for a late lunch but the service to take our order was quick. The menu was fairly large including burgers, hot dogs, fries and shakes. I went for the classic double cheeseburger basket. My husband got the California double cheese. The main difference between the two? The California had lettuce an tomato. Both were delicious. We also really enjoyed the shoestring French fries. They were fresh and crispy and paired with their fry sauce delicious. I am generally and In N Out fan but these burgers were a different style and very flavorful. Another big plus was the comfortable dining area that was like being in an old malt shoppe.

I have been wanting to get my eyebrows tattooed since I'm tired of drawing them on everyday. I met with and talked to Ronna and decided to go for it. The shop was super clean and I liked the fact that she took great care to make sure that there was no cross contamination. She was great about mixing the colors she had, to come up with the perfect color for me. Ronna was great about starting off small then adding more as we went along so I could see the progress. She even gave me different shape options. She had a really light touch and between that and the numbing cream she applied I was barely uncomfortable. The color was pretty dramatic the first few days but since color fades pretty quickly I am happily adjusted now. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this shop to anyone for any of your tattoo needs.

After a lot of looking I found a car I was interested in on their website. I called and set up an appointment to look at it. After the long drive out from Goodyear I was really hopeful that I would like the car. When I arrived it was nice of them to offer some water before my test drive. They pulled the car around and sent me on my way. I like this no pressure experience because it really gives you a chance to check out the car.  Once back at the dealership they worked out the deal I asked for with no haggling which was great. At that point I decided to return with my husband to make sure he liked the car as well.  When we got back once again we took the car out with the same results. No pressure just super friendly service. We decided we wanted the car. Everyone was great from our sales person Jon-Erik to the finance guy Ian. This was by far the easiest most laid back purchase I have had. I would definitely return for another purchase.

After moving from an area where you can only buy alcohol and state run liquor stores where the price is set by the state, walking into Total Wine I felt like a kid in a candy store. I wasn't sure where to start looming first. Not only did they have every type and brand of alcohol I could imagine they selection of beer was great and the wine selection was enormous. To top it all off the prices are great! The also have wine tasting on the weekends so you can try out some of the wines you are unfamiliar with. I have also noticed that the people who work there are very knowledgable and are able to answer any questions I have. They have also suggested several wines for me that have been delicious. They also have a nice selection of glasses and bar accessories as well.

We have been wanting to try this chain for quite some time and since we were staying very close we decided to do dinner big our last night in town. It's a very different dining experience since you don't really get a good menu. The salad bar is nice with a lot of good choices but the real star of the meal is all of the different and delicious cuts of meat you get to enjoy. If you love meat I can't recommend this place enough. My husband was in heaven here. Toward the end it was a little much for me and I think that when we return I would want to eat the salad with my meat because it would break it up a bit. We also enjoyed an amazing creme brûlée that was probably one of the best I have ever had. The service was amazing very top quality and ever present whenever we needed anything.

I don't live in EMR, but it's only a little farther for me to drive to this Safeway than the other Safeway near I-10. The reason I drive a little farther is because the store is super clean and nice, especially compared to the other location. The employees are more friendly at this location as well. They are also always well stocked which is a huge plus for me. Nothing frustrates me more than going to buy something only to find it sold out.

I recently dropped my iphone and shattered the screen. I was extremely bummed since I have no insurance on my phone. Luckily for me I looked up iphone repair on Yelp and found AZ iPhone Repair. I went in to get my phone fixed and was surprised to see all the different color options that were available. They also carry cases and accessories for less than most places. They guy working was friendly and also very knowledgeable. I have no doubt I will be back even if it's just to get some bling for my phone.   If you have a problem with your phone or just want to make it unique check this place out. You won't be sorry.

We had a work function in Scottsdale so we decided to have a late lunch/early dinner.  I was surprised when we walked in and found all the tables full but one. We were happy to take the last one. The decor has an island feel complete with the music and decor. The beer was very reasonably priced and there was a great selection. I opted for the coconut porter which was yummy.  We ordered the chili con Fritos appetizer which took a while to come but it was worth the wait. The chili was good and just spicy enough. I opted to the special burger a bacon blue cheese burger. I ordered it on the brioche bun but it came on the pretzel bun instead. I'm going to call this a happy accident because I loved it.  The service was a little slow but it was really busy in there. The food was reasonably priced and very tasty. I would definitely return and may be dreaming of that pretzel bun..

I have not been to a Zumba class since I moved to Arizona. I found Imagine that when I was driving by and decided to give it a try. I was very happy to find that the class was challenging and fun. The studio was clean and the instructor was great! She was also very encouraging. The class price was also very reasonable. I am definitely going to be back to get my Zumba on!

Love this place! Hubby and I stopped in for happy hour and enjoyed the company at the bar. The owners were working and we enjoyed talking with them. They had a great wine selection as well as a delicious cheese board. We will definitely be back!

Hubby and I went in for date night. I really liked the inside of the place although the outdoor area looked great too. We opted for inside and sat near the bar area. The menu is pretty large maybe because I went in thinking it was just going to be pizza. Lots of things looked appetizing but we both opted for pizza. We each ordered one so we could try a couple things and they were reasonably priced (around $10 each). I ordered the Margherita pizza and hubby ordered the meat lovers. I was not a huge fan of my pizza but my husband's was good and he ate the entire thing. I would either order a different pizza or try something else on the menu. They have a good selection of beers and it looked like a great selection of wine, which I plan to try next time we are in. So yes, even though I didn't care for my pizza I will come back and try something else because I liked the environment.

Headed out on date night with friends and decided to try This place for dinner based on the pictures on Yelp. Anytime my husband can get a good burger and good beer he is happy. They have a super small parking lot so you will most likely need to park on the street. We were kind of early so there was plenty of parking around when we arrived but it had filled up by the time we left.  There is a huge board behind the bar that lists all of the beers available. While we were there they erased and replaces at least two that I saw so if you see something you want order it! We tried a flight of beers so we could sample multiple. They have a good variety.  My husband had the Outlaw Burger and enjoyed it. I had the BBQ grilled cheese which was very tasty. The fries were also really good. My friend had the Fun-guy flatbread which was also very good.  Even though we were on the full side we decided to split some desert. We ordered the Blueberry pop tart and the salted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. The pop tart was amazing! Definitely a must order. The cookie was too sweet for me but the guys loved it.  Overall great experience!

I really really wanted to like this place, but pretty much none of our visit was a good experience. First off we arrived just after 7am but they don't actually open until 7:30. This was not a big deal to me because I understand that times change and may not be updated. We went and did a few things than came back. I liked that we could sit outside especially since it was such a beautiful morning. The server who greeted us was super friendly and told us we could sit anywhere. We took a seat outside and a few minutes later another server came out and have us menus. She told us the specials-eggs Benedict, a shrimp omelette and a breakfast burrito. We decided on the build your own omelette. My hubby got sausage and cheese and I got bacon, jack, tomato and onion.  After we ordered the server who greeted us when we first came in told another customer the specials. A shrimp omelette with a delicious tomatillo sauce, eggs Benedict-normal or Chorizo and a chorizo breakfast burrito. If the specials had been explained to is that way we both probably would have ordered something else. Oh well.  Finally our food comes out. It looked pretty good, but about 1/4 of the way through my omelette I realized that is was almost entirely onion and tomato with a splash of bacon. It was also very bland and the filling tasted like oil. The potatoes were different and actually the best part of the meal.  We never saw our server again until she dropped off our check way after we were finished eating. She did ask us then if we needed anything but at this point I just wanted to go.  The final straw? She comes back and picks up the check then proceeds to go bs with another customer for about 5 minutes before she takes care of our bill.  Maybe if the food had been awesome or if the service had been great up to this point I wouldn't have cared but all of it put together was too much. We will not be back.

This is one of my favorite places to hang out while at the Diamondbacks game. Not only are the bartenders super friendly, but there is plenty of seating within the bar area and if you are lucky you can get a table with a great view of the game. It is located on the club level so you have to have either club level or suite tickets to access it. There is a food court area right across from the bar too so if you want to be able to watch the game and have access to food and the bar you should check this place out.

Lots of different choices of flavors and a huge amount of toppings and sauces. The staff was super friendly. There was not much seating inside so luckily when we visited it was dark outside so we were able to sit outside without being uncomfortable from the heat.

Super busy location and both times I have been here there is a huge line. It's almost like chaos in the lobby. I don't know if it is because it's a busy locaiton or because they are unorganized. I went inside then thought better and went through the drive thru where there was only one car ahead of me. The drive thru was fast but the prices were super high. $7.75 for a 10 piece McNugget meal. Wow! Won't be going there again. Next time I will either go to the Subway across the street or Taco Bell down the road!

How have I not been in this store before? If you like accessories-this is the place to come. The have every color imaginable including classic black and white. For some reason I thought this was mostly a clothing store but there are very few clothes and shoes. Mostly purses and jewelry. To top it off everything was reasonable priced. I can't wait to come back and do some actual shopping.

We have driven past this place several times and we finally decided to give it a try. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly. We were offered cups for samples and they had several flavors to choose from. I had the white chocolate and it was delish! The prices were good too. I'm happy we stopped in and I'm defi Italy going to be coming back. They also have punch cards and double punch day on Tuesday!

I attended my first concert at this location earlier this week. I was surprised by where this is actually located. I think I have driven by on 83rd without realizing it was there. The venue is very large and seems to be divided into two sides with entry dependent on where you park. We had general admission lawn seating which was decent although once the concert started everyone stood through the whole thing. It was pretty much impossible to see the people on stage well enough to know who wAs who without the big screens from that far back so if that is important to you spring for the more expensive seats. I was happy where we were and enjoyed the concert. Concession prices were typical for that kind of venue $4.50 for a bottle of water. As drunk as everyone seemed around me they must have made a fortune on alcohol sales.  Overall I really enjoyed the night and the outdoor venue. Gotta live Phoenix evenings in Oct. I wouldn't hesitate to attend another concert here.

This location is really close to home and I like to stop in about once a week in the morning and get an order if biscuits and gravy and a coffee. Sometimes the gravy is awesome with pieces of sausage and a really good biscuit, but more recently the gravy is awful. It is often too thick, but this morning there were giant lumps in it and no sausage. The biscuit was also hard and undercooked. Here's a thought-if it's not ready don't serve it. I would rather be told it's not ready then sent on my way with terrible food. Another peeve-I always order a large coffee and somehow it always comes in a different size cup. I know it's a fast food joint, but a little consistency would be nice.

We found this place while we were waiting for Chase Field to open before a DBacks game and have been coming in before each game since. The food is really good and I love the homemade nacho cheese sauce. The chicken on the nachos is really good too. They have a large selection of beers including several local selections. All of the dishes we have seen come out look really good but I haven't been able to tear myself away from that darn nacho sauce. Maybe next time...

I had a wide range of emotions when I visited. #1 I was super excited to realize that I was close enough on other business to pop in and give this place a try. #2 I was disappointed when I saw the menu it seemed simpler than I expected. Not that that is a bad thing I just thought it seemed like most other sandwich shops. #3 I took my first bite and realized exactly what all the fuss is about. It was delicious. The roast beef was tender and tasted fresh. It was also extremely affordable which is always a plus in my book. The service was very friendly and professional. I visited right after they opened but from what I understand it gets super busy. If you are in the area and want a sandwich that puts the rest to shame stop by and give them a try.

We have been in the Phoenix area for a couple years and I have wanted to try Oregano's for quite some time but we are never close to one. We have been watching the location in Goodyear being built and I couldn't wait any longer so we drove to Glendale specifically to eat here. I am happy to say that our experience totally exceeded our expectations.  We had a bit of a wait when we arrived around 4pm. I was surprised at how busy it was at that time of day. I was hopeful that was a good sign.  Once we were seated we were greeted by our awesome server Jeff. He was very welcoming and gave us some great suggestions. We ordered garlic cheese bread for our appetizer, pepperoni and olive pan style pizza and the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert.  I honestly could have just had the garlic cheese bread and been totally satisfied. It was delicious and tasted so fresh. The pizza was amazing! I can't wait to try more of their pies! The dessert was soooo good. Even though I was full I couldn't resist the dessert.  On top of the delicious food our server Jeff was fantastic. He could not have been any more friendly or attentive. If you decide to stop in ask for him and I am sure you will be delighted. I can't wait for the Goodyear location to open and I hope the service is as good as it was at this location.

After reading the other reviews I was anxious to try this place. So when my friend asked me if I wanted to go get a pedi I said yes and suggested the Pedicure Lounge. I made us an appointment and off we went. I could tell this wasn't your typical nail shop from the moment I walked in. The salon was super clean and very modern. The decor was awesome and felt spa like. I decided on the "beer" pedicure, which is the more deluxe pedicure. I picked a color and we got started. I was offered a drink and enjoyed a delicious mimosa during the service. On top of the terrific products (most of which are made in house) and the great massage, I really enjoyed feeling pampered. My nail tech, Diane, did not rush through my pedi and most importantly she took her time and did not hurt me. Oh I forgot to mention how clean everything is too. The cost was a only a few $ more than I normally pay by the time I pay for all the add ons at other nail salons. Better products with people who take their time and make me feel special-yes I will be back.

Hubby and I were looking for somewhere new to eat in Goodyear. We decided to give Austin's a try. This is a new restaurant that just opened in the old native New Yorker location in the Safeway shopping center. The first thing we noticed upon walking in was the updated wall between the entry and the bar. I love the way it looks. It felt much more up to date and more upscale then when it was NNY. We decided to sit in the restaurant and we were seated quickly. There were several tv's both in the bar and located throughout the main dining area.  Our server took our drink order quickly and we were happy to see a fairly large amount of beers on tap including a couple of my favorites like Kilt lifter, Moose Drool and Blue Moon. They also had several to choose from in bottles and lots of mixed drink options. Their wine list was fairly limited but they had some decent selections.  The menu contained a wide of variety of items like taco's, pizza & wings, burgers, salads and sandwiches or even steaks. It would be hard not to find something that interested you.  I went with the green chile fries which were super delicious and came in a large portion. Hubby had the BBQ bacon burger which he really enjoyed.  Our server was great and made sure our drinks were refilled and that we had everything we needed.  Because this restaurant is close to our house I am super happy that another restaurant opened in this location. I am anxious to go back and try something else or maybe take in a game. Enjoy~

I really wanted to like this place but maybe I had my hopes set too high. It was clean and the employees were friendly but the food really lacked for me. I definitely did  not feel like it was fresh and delicious. It felt like heavy smothered mexican food. It was salty and the shredded chicken was greasy to top it off. I doubt quite seriously that we will return. I would much rather have Chipotle.

After reading all the great reviews we finally made it into Phoenix to try out The Henry. I absolutely loved it! The breakfast menu was not too extensive but there were a lot of tasty items to choose from. I decided on the 2 egg breakfast with bacon. I ordered my eggs scrambled and I think they may have been the best scrambled eggs I have ever had.  My hubby had the chicken fried chicken which came with biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were absolutely delicious.  I liked that I was also able to enjoy a Bloody Mary with my breakfast too. Our awesome server Adam told us that they actually have a build your own Bloody Mary cart on the weekends between 10a-2p. I am anxious to go back and give that a try.  If this was closer to home I'm pretty sure we would be here several times a month. We will definitely be back even with the drive because it was that good. Great food, unbelievable service and a cool atmosphere!

We were out and about and decided to stop in for a beer and some wings. We were greeted promptly and sat right away. There were a fair amount of people in the restaurant for the time of day. There is a nice bar some high top tables and an area with short tables and booths for those with kids. We were happy to see Shock Top available and we were especially happy when we found out it was only $2.75! We shared an order of 20 wings which were quite large and meaty. We ordered garlic Parmesan buffalo sauce in medium, but next time we would definitely get hot as medium was not too spicy. They had several other sauces to choose from. We are definitely planning to return to try some of the other foods or appetizers. This would be a fun place to watch a game or hang out with a group of friends. The food was great, the beer was COLD, the service was quick and friendly and the prices were awesome!

This was my second visit with much improved service. On my first visit, right after they opened, the service was painfully slow. This time around was far better. I think they may still be working out a few issues but as long as it continues to improve I will be happy. The staff is super friendly and polite. Also the restaurant decor is nice and new and everything is super clean.  On this visit I was anxious to try their margaritas so I ordered my personal favorite the Cadillac margarita on the rocks. It did not disappoint. In fact it was without a doubt the best margarita I have had on the west side. I would go back for that alone-the picture I posted should speak for itself. My hubby's eyes lit up when they places his ice cold beer in front of him.  Five stars for the drinks! The food was good-is it the best Mexican food I've had? No, but it is definitely as good as the other "sit down" type restaurants in the area. That plus the drinks makes this my new go to place when we are looking for Mexican food and a night out. I hope their service continues to improve and the drinks don't change!

After sampling sandwiches at a yelp event I have been wanting to visit since then. We were finally in the area so we stopped by. There are several options to choose from on the menu including several vegetarian and vegan options. I went with the Pat Tillman which was roast beef, mushrooms and mozzarella sticks plus a bunch of other stuff like lettuce, tomato and the dirty sauce. This sandwich was very big and could easily be split between two people. My hubby had the Thunderbird and he really enjoyed it. In fact he said it was the best sandwich he has ever had. The prices are good for what you get but I think having a smaller less expensive size for lunch would be a plus. Would that stop me from returning? Heck no. That sandwich was amazing and the crunch bread-out of this world! Oh how I wish we had a location in the west valley!!

My son recently started taking boxing classes at Sonny's. I found out that they offered a chick boxing class. I really wanted to try it but I was afraid that I would not be able to do it and that everyone in the class would be way more physically fit than me. What I found was a great group of women and men. Some are very fit and others are like me. I'm getting a great workout every day in a super positive and supportive environment. Sonny encourages us to work at our own pace and to start out with lower weights/reps to prevent injury. One of the things I like best about this class is that I do push myself and it is really built on simple principles of work hard for the reward. I have seen some huge results from some of the other women who have been taking the class for a while and I am really looking forward to seeing where I am in a few months. After just a few weeks I am already noticing a difference in what I can do.  Oh by the way it is super reasonably prices to take the class. You can either pay $5 for each class or a flat rate of $60 per month. Well worth it for what you get. Hope to see you there!

We stopped in for dinner. It is a casual restaurant setting all new and very clean. The service was good and quick. I ordered the sesame chicken combo which came with soup to start and the chicken, rice and chow mein. It also came with an egg roll and two cheese wontons that were really good. The portions were large which I love because that gives me enough for lunch the next day. The prices were reasonable and the good was as good as anything in the area. They also offer take out.

I was super excited when i found out a BBQ place was opening on this side of town.  I have visited on two different occasions, once for lunch and once for breakfast. I enjoyed the food both time. My first visit was the lunch visit. We got the moist brisket and and some baby back ribs, plus a side of coleslaw. I really really liked the brisket. That combined with the coleslaw was awesome even though I have had better coleslaw. The ribs were also good and I liked the regular BBQ  sauce but the sissy sauce was good too.  My next visit was breakfast. I was very surprised at how much food I got for $1.90. I went with the 4 item taco- eggs, cheese, potato and brisket. I got two tacos and could not eat them both. The second taco I had everything the same except the meat which was chop. It was a little spicier and had some BBQ sauce. I enjoyed both and next time I will try the jalapeño sausage to refried beans or one of the other many combinations.  Overall I really like the set up and all of the food I have tried. I'm ready to go back and try the pulled pork sandwich.

I was hesitant to go in after reading the reviews on here but since this was the closest store to my house and I had limited time I decided to give it a shot. I was greeted right away when I entered the store and was helped shortly after that. The employee who helped me, Rob, was super helpful and gave me great information while I was trying to decide which phone to get. Once I made my decision the activation and check out process was quick and easy. He also pointed out that we could get a discount on our bill because of where my husband works and took care of setting that up as well. I was so happy with the service that when my husband wanted to go get a new phone a couple days later we went back. Both times I was there I saw every customer that came in get a friendly greeting and helped within an appropriate amount of time. I would definitely return here next time I am ready to get a new phone. Oh-they also had a good amount of accessories at a decent price.

This store is huge! I could literally spend hours in there looking and trying things out. On this visit we went in to purchase a futon because we had guests coming to town. There was a very decent selection with prices ranging from $134-350. Once we figured out what we wanted I did have a little trouble finding someone to help us which is the one reason that I am not giving 5 stars in this review.  The checkout was quick and easy. Everything that needed to be explained to me was. The box was pretty big and they are very specific on how you can transport things home, which is the other reason they only get 4 stars. I am not sure exactly how I feel about this because I can see their side but it was just a little too specific. I do like that they have trucks available to rent, which I did, for a very low cost. They loaded the truck and tied it town for me. I will definitely return for more purchases but would advise everyone to listen carefully when they explain the "rules" on picking up your merchandise.

After a bit of a break we decided to give this place another try. I am so glad that we did! On our last two visits both the food and service have been excellent. I am totally in love with the huevos benedictos for breakfast. I could easily have this every weekend!

I had no idea that this place was even in the works or I would have been super anxious for it to open. I really really like the atmosphere here. All of the staff I interacted with was super friendly. The place had a fun vibe just like it should. We ended up spending about 3 hours there not because service was slow, in fact quite the opposite. We were just enjoying our drinks and chatting with the people around us. The live music tonight was awesome! That guy can sing! They were doing brewery tours but we didn't make it on one. The had a lot of IPA type beers which aren't my favorite but I hear there is a wheat type beer on its way. I'm anxious to try that. I liked the pepper infused vodka Bloody Mary and the Arizona Mule (vodka, ginger beer and prickly pear syrup)  I thought things went pretty smoothly considering the short amount of time since they opened. Come on people-you can't expect perfection from the get go. I would like to see some drink menus and specials or some type of happy hour. Either way we will definitely be back. I'm happy to have a place like this in Goodyear!

I heard about this store a few months ago but never made the drive to The store closest to me. I was very excited when I found out that we were getting on in Goodyear. I showed up for the grand opening with a lot of other people. Unfortunately I was too far back to get the gift bag they were giving away but I did get a coupon to use that day. I spent a lot of time in the store for two reasons. #1 there was so much to look at and #2 I couldn't decide what I wanted to buy, not because I couldn't find anything but because I wanted everything. I really didn't see anything I didn't like so this is going to be a dangerous store for me in a good way :) I am sure that I will be doing quite a bit of Christmas shopping here for my family and friends. Oh I forgot the most important thing-the prices are super reasonable too!

I remember when I first saw this place was opening I thought what's they big deal about bundt cakes? The whole I was at the women's expo I tried a sample and could not believe how moist the cake was. It was delish! Then I kind of forgot about them since I'm not really that much of a sweets person, until I went to visit my cousin. She told me that she is getting her wedding cake from them and suggested we pick up a couple of the smaller cakes so we could try them out. Again-I realized how good they are. We had the lemon and white chocolate raspberry. I really liked the lemon and scraped some of the icing off since it was a little much for me. My husband was happy to take that off my hands because he loved it.  Less than a week after we came home I was craving some bundt cake and found this location. We headed down and picked up a marble and chocolate turtle cake both of which were terrific. I have no doubt we will frequent this place since after writing this review I am craving bundt!

I was excited to see this place open and anxious to give it a try. We both ordered the gyro special which came with a drink and your choice of fries, hummus or a Greek salad.  I went for the hummus and my husband had the fries. Both sides were good but the star of the meal was definitely the gyro. I would have been more than satisfied just having that. The meat and sauce was really tasty. I definitely want to go back and try some of the other dishes.   The only thing I would caution is that it did take. While for the food to come out. More like you would expect at a sit down restaurant than a take out place.

I have searched high and low for a good nail salon close to home. I have been to this salon before and was not impressed but I needed to get my nails done and didn't have time to drive across town so I headed in.   I could tell from the moment I walked in something was different. I was created by a super friendly guy who turned out to be the new owner. He is extremely personable and has a great sense of humor. His customer service skills are excellent!   I am super happy with my nails as well as the whole visit. They are very friendly and super professional. Oh and a huge plus for me-everything is super clean. I can't wait to go back for a much needed pedi!

I am happy to update my review and raise a star on both service and food. We went in on our anniversary which also happened to be a graduation night. It was super packed with large parties but we were able to get a seat at the bar. The food was a huge improvement over our last visit ranking right up there with the other locations we have visited. Yes-there is still a huge wait but we have waited at the other locations too. It's a popular place. The only thing holding back a five star rating is the fact that they still seem a little understaffed. The poor bartender was running her butt off trying to take care of everyone and she just couldn't. Keep moving in the right direction! We are happy to have this restaurant in Goodyear b

I have been anxiously waiting for this location to open so I am super lucky that I was able to go in today for their friends and family day. The concept here is really cool-pick the size you want, tell them what sauce and toppings you want and pay one price. The prices are super reasonable too. They have several sauces and toppings to choose from as well as "strips" that you can drip. Garlic for the savory and cinnamon that you can dip in chocolate, strawberry or cinnamon glaze.  The have a drink station that has fountain drinks as well as tea and lemonade. The Marion Blackberry Lemonade was awesome. They also have bottled beverages and wine and beer on top. The beer on tap was Papago Orange Blossom-one of our favorites. We are excited to go back when we can partake. They also have milkshakes.  The food itself was very good and I really liked the crust. It's thin but was crispy and delicious.  This is a cool place and I can see us going on a regular basis because we love pizza and the prices are great which allows us each to pick whatever king of pizza we want.

I used to shop at Winco often when I lived in Oregon so I made the drive to Surprise to check out the new store. Walking into the store was like visiting an old friend for me. It is set up like all of the other stores I have been in. I was impressed with the quality and prices of the produce and I really loved the bulk food area as well. There are so many options to choose from and it's nice to be able to buy a large or small amount for a great price.  I noticed some good savings on the products I usually buy although some items were the same or higher than what I am used to. Unless you buy the 10# package of hamburger it's cheaper at Fry's. I feel like I got a lot for what I spent and I will most likely return when I want to do some major shopping. It would be awesome to have a store closer to my home (Goodyear). Oh as an added plus there were some of my favorite brands here that I have not been able to find since we moved. Yay!

I have been dragging my feet finding a new vet for my canine kid. I decided to go ahead and make an appointment at the newly opened office by Fry's. From the time I called in to make the appointment through the call I received the next day to check in and see how things were going I experienced nothing but friendly, caring professionalism. The office was clean and comfortable and I really, really liked Dr. Riehle. She was great with my dog and made sure to answer all of my questions. I also received 1/2 off my exam fee since it was my first time in. I will definitely return.

If I could give more stars I would. I called in the morning hoping to get in for a massage because I was in a lot of pain. I opted for a 90 minute therapeutic massage and was able to get in that evening. When I arrived I was shown to the dressing room where I was given a locker to put my clothes and personal items in. There was a robe and slippers waiting for me. Then I went to the waiting area where they had a tiki bar set up with snacks and water.   I didn't have to wait long until my therapist came to get me. She took me to the treatment room where we had a short consultation and went over my paperwork. Before  starting the massage she asked me if I wanted lotion or oil and I also had a choice of music. She was attentive through the entire massage. I am always concerned when I go somewhere new for a massage but all my fears were quickly gone. This was hands down the best massage I have had in years.   Afterwards I took advantage of the amazing shower with multiple shower heads that just added to my relaxation. I also loved the products they had in the shower as well. I think I want one of each! I will definitely be back and can't wait to try out some of the other services they offer.

How have we lived in Goodyear for a year and never tried Señor Taco? We fixed that tonight and let me just say yum! My husband and son ordered the chile verde burrito chimichanga style and both agree that it's the best burrito they have had on the west side. I ordered the carne asada fries. First of all the portion size is HUGE! I could probably make 3 meals out of it! Not only was it big, it was delicious. The meat was super tender and flavorful. The fries also had beans, sour cream and guacamole.  Yes the service was a little bit slower but think of it more like a restaurant that fast food and it might not seem so bad. I am anxious to try something else next time maybe a chile Rellano burrito chimichanga style. Mmmm. Always happy when we find a new favorite.
