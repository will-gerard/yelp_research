Dr Hakes and his team, especially Carol, are fantastic.  If you are in the Tatum Ranch/North Phoenix area, you should find your way to their office.  Second on the other review where their office is very organized and they are always on time.

Say it is not so!!! Cocomo's, please reconsider the decision to close down and change themes. The one thing that this area doesn't need is another Mexican restaurant! As my good friend Travis said, you can walk a block even up here in Cave Creek and trip over a Mexican restaurant. Even more abhorrent is taking away the concept of live music. Are you freaking kidding me!? How will quesedillas and burritos earn as much business market share as the one unique nightlife spot within 10 miles would? please think about what you are doing in terms of unique branding! Cocomo's faithful....sound off on this travesty before it's too late!!!

I don't think my experience was typical, and they were having an off night at Sierra Bonita Grill.  Normally cuisine is very well prepared, but when I got my enchiladas they were cold and watery.  The guac was already kinda browning after a minute or two at the table, which made it unpaletable.  For the price, I would expect better.  I will still give them another shot, their service is always great.

Sundays at Catch 22: Dear Dave H and gang, I just wanted to share an experience with you and your followers from last Sunday evening.  As you know, there's a lot of us that love Catch 22 and go there every chance we get.  I love your place so much that I tried to spread the word and get some new fans by inviting a group from PVCC nearby over that were having a party for finishing a theater show they had performed over 2 weekends.  Our overall experience was really, really bad, and it's because of the fact that your team is understaffed on Sunday nights and also because the tap lines were clogged up - yes, seriously - the beer tap lines were clogged.  The team there that night - Sean, Misti, Emily, Jacque did their best to try and keep up but they just couldn't.  We had 20 people there and guess how long it took to get our first round of drinks? 45 minutes.  Not kidding.  Our food orders took 75 minutes.  The servers were so busy that the last part of our order was set down on a table nowhere near us and they just lost track of it.  For a Sunday night, after Misti left, there was 1 bartender and 2 servers, one of which couldn't serve alcohol.    I want to see Catch 22 be a great choice on a Sunday night for all of us.  Please get the tap lines fixed (staff said it was building up to this for a long time) and get a couple more people staffed (they say this has been long overdue also, with no action being taken).  I don't think any of the staff/faculty I brought from PVCC will be going back there ever again - I don't want you to lose more customers because of this.   I'm pulling for you - please make some changes.  thx, David

Great food, made from scratch and good, honest staff. Bakery is authentic and it's a great spot to stop in and get a slice of pizza on the go.    The ambiance is unmemorable but don't get caught up in that.  If you want a good authentic meal, eat at Belfiore. If you want cheesy ambiance, go to the place with the Pope room. ;)

Although the food is pretty decent, there were a couple things that really made our trip tonight kinda bad....the food was not served until a full hour after we sat down (we got there at 7 pm on a Friday which is peak,but then again we were seated in less than 10 min. Also, during that hour wait, couldn't help but look around and notice the     chunks of food (seriously) that laid on the floor next to tables that were recently vacated, then as tables were cleaned the food scraps were left there in plain view. Kinda nit picky I know, but also kinda disgusting.

The folks at this store are great. Always helpful and know you by name if you come in often enough. There are usually special items lining the aisles which are awesome deals. Great rewards program. They also have one cool novelty: old hard to find sodas like Cheerwine and old fashioned cream sodas, both on ice and in cases to go. Free popcorn and hot dogs on the weekends sometimes!

Great food, beautiful atmosphere.  Must have the sopapillas, they are the best in the area.  Worth the drive from other parts of the valley.

Mojito is a fantastic store, with a friendly staff and a really great active membership.  Bill is a great proprietor and has a staff that is friendly and knowledgable. I wish they had longer hours on weeknights, even an hour longer to 8 pm would be helpful for a full time worker like me that can't get over there by 7 pm usually.  But, great selection of cigars and always bringing in new stuff.

Good stuff here.  Very authentic and a few different items you won't find in mainstream Mexican food. The Poquito bean and cheese burrito is grilled on the outside to finish - delicious.

Stopped by and got a self serve salad from their salad bar....lots of options and reasonable price. Looks like great pizzas and sandwich variety also. Cool baked goods counter that also served as a quick way to check out since the main counter had a line. Nice wide open contemporary and clean atmosphere too.

Gertrude's was a wonderful unexpected surprise.  Using locally sourced ingredients and with a diverse but limited menu, it is bound to satisfy eclectic tastes.  Staff was very helpful but spread thin, and seating is limited indoors with a lot on the patio for non summer time, I suppose. But all of that is more than counterbalanced with the DELICIOUS food.    Try the corn fritters if they still have them - they are fantastic.

FYI, heads up to non-corporate customers wanting to use this garage: Choose another parking spot when you come downtown. They have taken away a key feature of parking here which is that you used to be able to get 2 validation stamps if you are going to eat and shop, but now they limit you to only one as of nov 1st. There are much more affordable parking options just another block away.

Great location and nice atmosphere. Attentive staff and good beer specials including Brewers choice. Awesome wings that are smoked, baked and grilled.

Have been ready to welcome back a real bar and grill to this location and the Creek is a much better manifestation of the spirit of Cocomo Joes that we've been missing for so long! Brick oven pizza and burgers are great. Wings were ok. Good beer selection and good happy hour. New patio is great. Now all we need is some live entertainment (get the Crown Kings please!) and we'll be back in business to fill a niche gap for this dead zone between desert ridge and cave creek town.
