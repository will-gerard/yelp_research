My little girl has been going here for about 1 1/2 years now and she loves it. I see all the negative comments but kids will be kids. I have scene first hand problems with kids but the teachers are on top of it and correct the matter right away. Not only that but they tell you about it later when you pick up your kid so you can talk to them about it. Granted there are some bad parents out there but the teachers are there to help you along the way. Especially if you are a new parent just getting the hang of things. The staff is very friendly and it's nice when you walk your child in and you get a warm welcome.  Awesome job, keep up the good work.

Just going to say the people at the front desk need an attitude check. Customer service was super shitty nothing but attitude. The doctor was awesome though he just needs to hire new people to work the front desk that want to work here.  They need to put more fans in the front lobby and fix the ac In The lobby.  They should probably start doing prescreening to animals so they don't wait an hour or more to tell them sorry your animal is sick and cannot get shots today.  Saying get on the scale for your weight check with attitude is not prescreening.

Food is always excellent and the shrimp spring rolls are great.  The bathroom on the other hand is always dirty and nasty. There is always pee on the floor in the bathroom and it smells bad in there.  Food #1.    Bathroom save it for home.

Excellent place to take your animal.  Took my dog to get check out due to another clinic that would not give him his rabies shot. The clinic said his nose was inflamed and might have possible mites so no rabies for him. I waited over an hour 1/2 at the vaccines clinic south of the 202 and ALMASCHOOL. You think they would of prescreened him and told me he's a no go  instead of having me wait that long. So it's been a long day not to mention freaking me out because of this. I called over 10 clinics and went with this place due to awesome reviews. It's between petco and Frys.  Passed by it 1000's of times never checked it out and I'm so happy I went here today. Everyone here is very friendly and like family. My dog checked out ok after tests and multiple shots and some meds and ointment. He's allergic to new fabric softener  on his blanket.  When the appointment was over I talked to the lady at the counter and let her know how great their customer service was and how I will be coming back in the future.

For the bowls being smaller than other places I would think the prices would be too, but they are not.

I would rather eat here than anything out there for lunch. I have never had a bad meal and it's giving back to the community. Being on the run all day it's hard to find a solid place and this is a good place to eat and take a break from the world.

A lot of items here are used but they are working. I found a great fridge that works really well. Had a few scratches but for the price I saved around$1500  so I could care less. They said if there is any problems in 30 days they would fix it and I did have a defroster sensor problem but you could never tell that on a test. It would have to actually run for a few days with food in it. They ordered the part and came to the house and fixed it in about 4 days. Chris and mark are excellent at what they do so I would recommend them.  Lots of good deals and I will be back in the future.

Very good bbq. I had the pulled pork but it should of been a bit more smokey. Spicy slaw its a little hot beware. I think for the price they should include a drink though. It's a small place so your probably better at getting it to go during lunch hours. People here are very southern like. That's nice for all the Arizonans.

Horrible. Every time I go to a circle k when I'm working the bathrooms are out of order.  This is the last time I come to a circle k.  I'm only going to QT from now on.  I will spread the word to our 400 employees at work as well.  This place is a joke.
