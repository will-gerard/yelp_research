Best food ever!! The falafel is the best in town, crispy outside and nice and moist inside. I also had the chicken shawarma entree, super yummy!! Everything is fresh, great customer service. It's family owned. You can't go wrong with this place at all, a must try!!

A little about myself I have been doing yoga for about 5 years, now getting back to doing yoga 3 times a week. The reason for my 2 star is the way the class was set up, everyone there was awesome and super friendly. I'm use to a peaceful and great energy in the yoga room which is what it should be. It was hard to feel that in this class since the yoga instructor was yelling over the loud music (since the instructor had no mic) to instruct the class for the next pose, then abruptly stopped one song not a very nice flow. I found it hard to concentrate and focus on my poses. The energy seemed really tense probably due to the teacher yelling and not fully peaceful throughout the class time. I would not come back for another class unless they were to make some changes like the teacher to have a mic. Also the space was a bit cramped, the front entrance to the locker room not to much space to get changed and get settled in.

L O V E this place!! Best ever and enjoyed every bite yummy!! I went with the pecan turtle, it was just for me so I went with the one scoop version. This yummy treat was worth it! Everyone was very nice and helpful. Of course I had to sample plenty but was able to find the one for me. Make sure to stop by because it's worth it!

L O V E this place, Sonia is my stylist. I found out about them through yelp.com. I came to her after a bad haricut from Arizona Hair Co in Tempe Marketplace. Sonia talked to me first and listened to what I wanted. She did a great job and fixed my hair :). After each style I get so many compliments and even from my mom which means a lot. She is intelligent and knows what she is doing. This will be my third time going this Saturday. I have found my stylist and I will be with her for awhile. Everyone that knows me, knows how PICKY I'am and Sonia is the best. One thing that is wonderful about Sonia is that she remembers our convo's and I know she take cares of a lot of people and that just makes me feel special! Cut and Color Sonia is a PRO, I trust her!!!

A little about myself been doing yoga for about 5 years and getting back to yoga 3 times a week.  Alright officially L O V E this place , I explored my options before committing to this studio to make my final pick for "my yoga studio" and this is the place where my heart brings me back :). The energy, the vibe its just amazing from the time you step in, the staff is very nice and personable. The owner Karin knows my name after 2 classes which makes such a difference. My first class Hot Yase was with Karin and she took the time to welcome all the new comers before beginning the class. Each class I've been to is amazing, great song choices lots of variety. Always leave class feeling so peaceful!! I would recommend to anyone and I tell all my friends and family about this place. I signed up for $20 for 20 and will be now signing up for student unlimited monthly $56 which is the best price out there. Oh and the studio is state of the art and up to date, spacious entry way, waiting area and locker room. A must go!

Nancy is bomb.com!! I use to live in Tempe and just recently moved to North Scottsdale and I still choose to make the long drive to just see Nancy. She knows what she's doing and has great taste. If you're unsure of what you should get done, Nancy will be there to help you out. She is the best and the only person I will allow to do my manicure. I even have my sisters and best friend seeing Nancy only. I always make an appointment with her, which I highly suggest. Because it's a busy nail bar. The nail bar is so beautiful and kept clean, I enjoy the music they play. Mindy runs the place and is the sweetest thing ever, everyone there I encounter are just great! This is the place to go, no doubt about that!

I will not be going back. Angry crab shack is by far & no question about it SO SO SO much better!!! The service and quality of food is below average. The server took forever to do anything, just to close out the check was over 20 minutes. The music was way to loud!! I couldn't even talk to my family members I had to yell. The ambiance was awful and not somewhere I would recommended to anyone. If you want awful service and bad heartburn because of the over seasoned low quality food then this is your place.

If I was able to I would give this place ZERO stars!! The lady at the register was not knowledgable about the menu which was off putting since it was my first time and I knew more about the menu then she did, very disappointing. I ordered the Mac and cheese cheesesteak, which was recommended by the guy who helped clean our table. It tasted awful! It had no flavor, the bread was cold and huge chunks of steak. My sister got the pad tai and it just didn't taste right or good and the noodles were undercooked. I will not be back again and would not recommend!! Eat at your own risk!!

I'm a very picky person and took me awhile to decided where to go did some research and came upon this place. My first time was not the best experience because I have sensitive skin and allergies. My first set gave me a allergic reaction but the manager was very professional. Gave me instructions and to wait for 48 hours to make before removal, also called each day to see how I was doing. At the end of it I did get then removed with no charge and got a whole new set replaced with another last specialist which I love! I'm addicted to them now and only go to one gal which she is the reason I come back because she is perfection! Everyone I have come across is professional and friendly. I do have to the membership and would recommend. Thank to all the amazing people at Amazing Lash Studio!
