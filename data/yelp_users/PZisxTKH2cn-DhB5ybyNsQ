I ordered the arizona burger last night and it was THE WORST hamburger I've ever had. It tasted like an over cooked, left over burger from a BBQ. The buns were also very dry, almost stale. I don't understand how anyone would serve the food they decided to put in front of me. The server never asked if we liked our food. She just picked it up (it barely had two bites from it) and asked if we wanted more beer. Very disappointed in the establishment. Not worth the drive and the hassle of parking a street away.
