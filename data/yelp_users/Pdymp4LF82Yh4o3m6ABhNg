If I had to describe service at this location in one word, one comes to mind immediately: SLOW. Took several minutes for staff to notice my entry (the "seat yourself" sign was out). Took several more minutes to get menus and drink orders in. Took over 10 minutes to get the server's attention to place the order for appetizers and main course. Took another 15 minutes for appetizers and FIRST drink refills. Main course another 15 minutes later SANS ONE ENTRE, which was a further 10 minutes. During the course of packing up leftovers, the server committed, in my mind, the ultimate faux paux by misgendering my girlfriend in spite of how well she presents on a daily basis, and today was no exception. I was displeased to the point of not leaving a tip, and I am seriously debating on whether I shall attempt a return trip in the future. Decent food quality throughout with a few minor annoyances: the honey barbecue sauce for the wings could use some more bottom to balance the sweet and the meat sauce for my pasta was watery and lacked a full-bodied flavor profile. I also heard a microwave door close several times, and that fails to inspire confidence in the freshness of the ingredients. My advice: better eats are to be had for less time, money, and annoyance.

Fresh ingredients to build your own, or use one of their recipes. Bubbling and gooey, with just the right combo of crunch and soft in the thin crust. Served up with a smile at a very reasonable price. Can't wait to get me some more.

Quality is starting to slide due to cleanliness issues with the oven. Getting charred bits of something on the crust now.
