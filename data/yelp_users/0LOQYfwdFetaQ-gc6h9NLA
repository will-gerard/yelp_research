this place looks really nice.  The ambiance was great, but the food blechk!  I ordered the lamb and it was basically just fat.  My Beau ordered the schnitzel and it was salty.  Our waitress was rude, and our bill was 100!  (2 entrees a bottle of wine and 1 appetizer)  When we got home my beau was up all night throwing up.  It was horrible!  In their defense after calling several times, they reimburssed our bill.  That was the first time I've ever called and complained anywhere.  I used to be a server so I know how it is sometimes, but this was just terrible!

I started going to Bryan after my stylist Jayme moved.  Bryan was her stylist, and is phenomenal!  Every time I leave I feel like a million bucks!  I have very thick, fine hair which ends up taking hours to do, but Bryan is always patient and thorough.  Recently, because of some hair damage (too many highlights and too much sun!)  we decided to do the bamboo treatment which really improved the structure of my hair, all of my flyaways disappeared!  Last week, I went in again, this time for the brazilian blowout.  WOW!  my hair is as smooth as silk.  It was already pretty straight, but now it's practially impossible to have a bad hair day!  I just get out of the shower and my hair dries perfectly in place!  Anyways, I love Urban Hair, the place is really bohemian chic, which I am a fan of and everyone is very friendly!  If you go you should ask for Bryan, although I've heard that Ethan is good as well.  I just prefer Bryan, I feel like he really pays attention to how my hair handles products, so it always turns out perfectly!

I have been coming here for years!  The prices are great and the owner is a gem!  (The rest of the staff is great too!)  Even though I haven't been in at least a year (I was flying on the east coast) she knew my name and remembered what I do and whatnot. ( I was never a regularly tanning person. I am generally very pale and usually just tan when I have a special occasion. Last time I was going often was my friends wedding 3 years ago....  Anyway. She is amazing the prices are great and Its very hygienic.  According to previous reviews the beds are older. But I dont mind...  its not worth paying a lot more and going somewhere snooty....

A few weeks ago I came here to have an alignment, because someone hit a curb in my car and my tire was wobbling pretty bad.  they did the alignment but that didn't fix the problem.  Well as it turned out I needed a new wheel because the old one was bent.  I drive a mini cooper, and they didn't have the wheel for it so they told me to go ahead and buy it (I bought it online) and they would install it for me.  What I didn't realize until I took it there for the installation was that they were going to do it free of charge.  I think these guys are great.  I will continue to go to them in the future!

I live in phoenix, and hadn't found any good mediteranean food since working in charlotte.  Today I finally found some!  I had the moussaka which was wonderful!!!  I finished my plate!  It didn't have a bechemal sauce, which is good since I'm watching calories anyway; but it was packed full of favor.  I also has the hummus and the bakalava, which was excellent!!!  The service was superb and I intend on becoming a regular.  The food is very fresh and flavorful.  It's a steal for what you get.  I highly recommend!!!

I went to rumors to get my roots done for my birthday, it was just a touch up.  I hadn't been to the salon before and my stylists name was Cory (or Codee, but she is a brunette girl I think Cory)  Anyway, she used a highlift instead of bleach (my hair is too dark for highlift it turns my hair orange- to compensate for the orange she put a ash (read purple) toner with it.  She then had me sit for an hour (possibly longer) while she took an updo.  when she rinsed my hair she did no rinse out all of my shampoo and when we got to the mirror i look and my roots + about 2 in are purple (she had mixed the highlift much further than just my roots and it over developed).   Instead of owning the mistake she complained that my hair had too much keratin, and was too difficult to comb through or dry.  (rinsing out the excess would have helped)  Anyway I insisted that she tone my hair (she said no it will just rinse out later, after a few washes, i explained again that i was getting my hair done for a party and that purple wasn't the look i was going for.  she did finally tone my hair but still didn't rinse it out very well so my hair was still pretty stiff and difficult to work with (which she insisted was too much keratin (i use aveda products with no keratin and have never had a problem)  She did finally get my hair almost right and (the roots +2 in were not the same color as the rest of my hair but it wasn't purple so that's a win right?) (oh and because she didn't match it she suggested i get highlights to blend it... why would i pay this girl more to fix a job she couldn't do in the first place?  it was just a root touch up)  Needless to say I will not be coming back, my stylist I normally see is currently trying to make everything blend.

I love last chance. Its a little like going to a Turkish bazaar no one is haggling you... its just really busy people are on the prowl. You'll here a Guy on his phone talking to his boss about getting the Tory Burch boots Marc Jacobs bag and a prada jacket....   my best shoes have come from here my $800 Pierre Hardy (which my old roommates dog in turn ate before I could wear them)  my Prada, Tory Burch, as well as an extensive collection of other shoes. Some I pay 18.99, others 29.99 and the really high end 69.99 and 99.99.  But compare That to 800 and its a steal.  Its true this place is not for the faint of heart. This is for those who want santee alley prices for the real thing!  (But pretty much the Santeria alley experience.  Looking at clothes is almost always a waste of time however. If you have hours to kill you'll find something but almost everything is torn.  Shoes handbags and spanx are the best items here.

I used to live right across the street from here, I love the food!  I still drive across town especially for the brunch!!!  They also have really good specials on food and drinks, and great happy hour / reverse happy hour!  I'm actually on my way in for some huevos rancheros and mimosas!

Let me preface this with that I would give them 5 stars if the rooms had upgraded amenities (flat screen tv., fridge in room (suite have them studio's don't)).  But the service here is awesome!  I came to the front desk, told them the price I saw online so he told me to book it through that because he couldn't do anything cheaper.  They let us check in early (noon) stay late (until 4) and when I saw our room was kind of small(the studios are small) upgraded me to a double queen suite for free because there were no king suite available.  All of the staff was very courteous.  The beds are very nice, and the linens are chic as well.  very clean looking.  There are pools all over the place, you don't have to roam long to get to a pool or jacuzzi.  :-)  I will definitely come here again, I just hope they add nice flat screens, we watched the playoff game and it would have been so much better on a flat screen (oh and the suite is very big, huge step up from the studio!)

I LOVE this place!  I used to come here at least 2x a week, now that I live further away I'm not there as often as I like, but whenever I get the chance I'm here!   This place is impeccable!  The ambiance is gorgeous!  The food is delectable, and the staff is superb!  Brian (the owner?)  always comes by the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves.  Mike (the bartender) always remembers what I order, even when it's been quite a while!  I really just can't rave enough about this place!  Every time I have a special event (or just want some good food or drinks!) This is where I'll be!

I love this place!  Every time I have a craving for Indian food this is where I go, even though I now live about 40 minutes from here!  The service is always great, and the food, oh it is wonderful!   I usually order the chicken tikka mahsala, or the chicken mahkni.  They are both SO good!  I also love their naan.  I've been to a few other indian restaraunts in the valley, al of which were claimed to be "the best indian food in phoenix"  but this truely is the best in phoenix!

I have to admit I am a big fan of yogurt.  this place just opened up and is open till midnight every night of the week!  (I get late night yogurt cravings)  This place is great, it's cute (not that that matters very much)  The staff is friendly, it isn't very expensive (.39 ounce.)  They have a bunch of flavors (personally I'm a fan of the cheesecake, cake batter and red velvet)  they also have sorbet and dairy/sugarfree options...  they also have a very wide range of toppings .  It's a lot like yogurtland, just in the moon valley area.

I have not yet been here. but i called to get a quote to change out the battery on my 2012 mini countryman.  he told me that it is covered by mini and to take it to the dealership.  I was shocked by his honesty.  he gave me a quote that if for any reason it wasn't covered i could have them switch it out for less than half of what the dealership quoted me.  I am very impressed by their integrity and will be using them in the future for whatever isn't covered by my warranty!

All I can say is yummm!  They make the best old fashioned donuts!  I am a sucker for a good donut and wouldn't bother with the corporate chains.... if you're going to eat a donut eat your donut here!  (or at rainbow donuts if you're up north)  The only thing that would make this place and rainbow better is if they had an espresso machine....   do yourself a favor and go get yourself a donut now!

I love this place!  I used to live down the road and completely gave up starbucks for them!  the staff is very friendly and knows my name and usual :-)  This place is way underpriced!  the large (32oz) is 4.50 m (24oz) is 4.00  inc tax!  How awesome is that?!?  They have thai tea, lattes,protein shakes, fruit shakes, italian soda, if it's a non alcoholic beverage they have it!  The food servings are huge!  You order a bear claw and it's the size of your face!  and the breakfast sandwich is fresh made (they go make it) and ginormous (i eat half and am full!)     This place is tops!  Great food, friendly staff and awesome prices!    I recently moved from down the street to scottsdale (near buzzberry) and while i like buzzberry the prices can't compete (buzzberry 24 oz (large) is almost 7$ after tax! )  their yogurt cup is half the size but the same price.  Buzzberry is good and they serve lunch and dinner and are 24hrs with a drive thru but they are much more expensive!  I still drive to black cat whenever time permits!  :-)

Ive used these guys a few different times....  Today to re-key a home we are remodeling, and a few months ago when my baby brain locked my keys in the car (thank god my lo wasn't in it yet!)  The techs were fast, and prices were great compared to what I've paid before when I locked my keys in my house, and compared to re-keys on our previous projects.   We will continue to use them :-)  Not sure why the other people posted negative reviews...  I am really happy with them.

We've tried this place twice.... I have no idea how the reviews are soo good because it is terrible... we live right down the street so thought we would give it another shot, the brisket was dry , mac and cheese was bleh collard greens didn't have much flavor.  The best part was the fries and really how can you screw up fried potatoes?  cornbread was also dry.... and pretty blah... I've made better out of a box.  I want to like this place because it is within walking distance and the owner seemed really nice.... but nice doesn't make the food taste better.

This is our new favorite date night spot.   Reminds me of SFO bars.  The staff is great, and drinks are on point.  It is a bit pricey though.  We really enjoyed the chefs board, and the beer bread!  Yumm!  They've had the same menu for a while- I look forward to a spring update (I hope)

Organic fresh pizza, good wine, excellent service!  Quiet atmosphere.  Plus 1/2 off pizza after 3 on Tuesdays!  Pizza is similar to Pomo but organic and less expensive.  Excellent place.  We really enjoyed our meal and are sharing this with friends
