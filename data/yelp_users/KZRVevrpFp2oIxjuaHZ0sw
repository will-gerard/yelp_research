What a blessing it was finding our way to cameo studios! I had my son's photographs taken there and I could not have asked for anything more! Fun, great atmosphere just a joy all the way around ! These aren't worn out photographers that are bored with their jobs these are young talented professionals. I have a son with a heart condition, who can be a little introverted at times. He was so comfortable with the photographer that we got some of the best photos we've ever had of him. And these photographs will last a lifetime and I could not be more pleased with that. Please disregard any of the negative comments you see. These people were clearly having a bad day!  After the experience that we had a cameo studios I cannot imagine taking my business anywhere else! true gem of Scottsdale! And as always we should support our local businesse!

Oreganos is very unique Italian eatery. I have never ordered anything here that I did not really enjoy. They're Bellinis are the best I have ever had! But my absolute favorite thing to order here are there meatballs!

What a bummer. . This used to be one of our families favorite places to go. We hadn't been back for quite some time. & I seriously doubt we'll ever go back. the menu is disjointed. Our spinach dip was runny and lacking flavor. the onion rings were not cooked through so the onions were raw and the breading was doee.  the macaroni and cheese was not edible. we asked for a side of salsa to try to give it some flavor and the salsa was disgusting. French fries were cold and stale. although our server was a nice enough guy he did not offer to comp or trade out any of the food. the only thing we were able to eat were the ribs.  Terribly disappointed.

Not only is this the best pizza around! But they are the nicest most genuine people you will have the pleasure of meeting! Our family is having a bit of a difficult time and they went out of their way to make us feel special. I cannot thank you enough!

The foods not bad. But if you can't find a place to sit in the bar you're outta luck for happy hour. Which I find it ironic at a place called thank God it's Friday!

Well.. the new happy hour sucks.. had all of friends from all over the valley drive all the way out here for our friends birthday.  Told them how Squid Inc has the Beat happy hr in town.. Not any more. No sense going out of you way for it. However they still have some of the best food! They are always friendly!  I live close enough to come offten. But now when we are talking happy hr we will be finding a better one.

I highly recommend getting a Bellini! Everyone of their pizzas is worth trying!  Grab a friend order a pizza and split a salad!

I drive out of my way to come here. Being able to create and customize your own pizza can not be beat!

I have never been disappointed in anything we've ordered from here. Their meatballs are the best in town! And you have to try a Bellini!!  Really fun atmosphere. And the staff always do a really good job. I highly recommend Oregano's if you haven't been before!

Extremely impressed with Haymaker restaurant! My son got the steak it was cooked to perfection! I got the ribs and chicken, both full of flavor perfectly cooked. I will go back for those ribs again and again. There was not one thing wrong with our entire meal. Great atmosphere friendly and knowledgeable staff. Looking forward to going back again!

We Loved it!  Got the combo bag! They only have a few each day I guess. We were lucky and got the last one. It was Wonderful!  Bloody Mary on point! The one poor review on here I don't get. She must have been having a bad day. Service was great! We will be back for sure!
