Just a basic mexican food place, nothing special. Food is bland needs more seasoning. Maby they tone it down for the winter visitors. Or maby people really do not know what mexican food should taste like. If you want bomb mexican food in the east mesa side go to dos los gringos or Elviras.

This place is wonderful, food is excellent and always striving to be better quality healthy food. Part of costs goes to good cause and this place has a friendly manager who cares about her staff. They will soon be rolling out an awesome breakfast menu opening at 7am looking forward to that.

Pancakes were good, but the tofu bowl had hard crunchy rice, and the eggs in the tofu wrap were over cooked. Just seemed like lazy prep and it's sad because they are one of 2 vegan places in Mesa. Not sure for 40 dollars for 3 people we will come back.

Omg this place is soo good. Wish it was closer but will travel to try all the different salads and wraps. Love the root soda. The don quixote salad was the bomb, try with the spicy yogurt instead good flavor.

Building is nice, do plan to come back. Just hope the wait staff and management learn to work together. Also stop using the melted butter on the toast it's gross!
