Read the reviews ... and agree with most of what I have seen - food is great - service is slow - but - not painfully slow for us.  We were seated right away and received our drinks.  Food was a little slow - but they had a LARGE table - I'm sure that stressed their resources a bit.  We used the time to catch up - so all is good.   I'd much rather receive fresh, hot, tasty food than something thrown together in a hurry just to meet a speed need.  You can tell by watching the kitchen that each dish is cooked to order.    Two of us ordered the Pad Thai, one a beef salad, and the other a peanut chicken dish.  EVERYONE was pleased with their selection.  I like mine a little spicier - and the condiment jars provided just what I wanted.  We also shared the Island Crab appetizer - and ordered a second!    Just like Arnold... I'll be back!

Solid.  Pollo con queso, shrimp fajitas, and carnitas tacos.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The chips and salsa were great.  Great service.  What more can you ask for.   Looking forward to a return trip and try some of their other items.  Thumps AND forks up!

I don't know what's happened here.  We came for happy hour last fall and were floored by how good the food was.  Been trying to find time to get back there, and finally did last night.  Wow.  I don't know if it was just the food items on the menu then vs. now or what.  My salad with Italian dressing was ok.  Nothing special.  Dining companions caesar - said it was salty - almost inedible.  The rolls were not pleasant to eat and we both were covered in crumbs trying to sample a bit.  He had the chicken picatta and said the sauce was great, but the portion size - even understanding it was the early bird special - left a LOT to be desired.  My lasagne bake was ok - 1/2 was great (the beef portion) - the chicken was not interesting at all.  Cheesecake was great though.  Service was great though.

I have a bias AGAINST chains ... I prefer to support the independent guy ... I find they care more, I get more unique experiences and food, and I like sharing the wealth a bit.  That said.  Man... the taco's at this place are amazing.  Full of flavor, bold but not over the top.  I love the delicate crunch of the fish filets that are fried.  I had the coastal trio - three different seafood tacos.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  Wow.... that doesn't happen all the time.  Great job all!

I've used dry cleaners / shirt laundry a significant amount - I don't like to iron my own shirts ... and love to have that fesh/crisp clean feel of a nice professionally laundered shirt.  These folks to a fantastic job... prices are good, convenient, drive up service,  and just down right good people.  I won't go anywhere else here in town.

I imagine there are a ton of great mexican food places in Phoenix.  I can't wait to find a better one than this - that's the ONLY reason I give it a 4 - so I can leave room for just in case I find something better (Note to YELP ... give me an option to do 4.7 or something like that... ok?)  Anyway - loved everything.  I hear what another reviewer said of the salsa - but my experience - it's like potato salad ... mom's is always (usually?) the best ... and everyone else is just not as good.  I loved it.  I loved it all.  My favorite haunt in Phoenix.

This used to be someplace I looked forward to when I visited Phoenix.  Last two times .. big disappointment.  Won't go back unless management tells me what they identified as what went "wrong" with so many folks saying just this same thing (it USED to be good) ... and what they did to fix it.  Too many places who want my money to waste it here.  If I had a choice between Via and Taco Bell.... it's a toss up.  Still trying to find the mexican food in Phoenix that I can LOVE again.  The Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon shows promise, but I'm still looking.  Sad.

With the overwhelming positive reviews, I must have just hit a bad night... but for what it's worth:  1.  Seating.  I'm thinking - Cheesecake Factory mass organization with no intimacy, EVERYTHING you say (or your neighbor says) is like you're at the same table with everyone one else.  2.  Service - no complaints.  3.  Appetizer - SMOKED CHICKEN + BLACK BEAN QUESADILLA * Avocado + Toasted Garlic Creme Fraiche $15. - Fantastic!  Wow.  4.  NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN * Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale - + Crushed Pecan Butter $36.  My meal.  Meat - no flavor.  Tender, but nothing special.  The sauces were ok.  The Tamale was DRY - disappointing.  Not anywhere near worth $36.. but the plate looked good.  5.  GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS * -Blackberry - Cascabel Barbecue Sauce + Collard Greens with Smoked Chiles $44.  My dining companions meal.  Blah.  Had a taste and was glad I ordered my boring pork tenderloin.  Collard Greens were nothing special.  6.  There was a side corn dish.  $10 fantastic.  I wish we had ordered two quesadillas and two orders of corn and called it good.  It was a Monday night - I was surprised it was so slow there that we walked right in and sat down.  Maybe I know why now.  With a $7 and a $14 bottle of beer... the $140 pre-tip was NOT money well spent.   At those prices... Bobby doesn't get a second chance... I had a steak at a mexican place in the MGM a couple of years ago that blew my socks off... I think I'll go back there tonight.

Brunch Saturday morning 10/19 ... Great Service.  Great food.  Great location.  Joey - you were awesome!  I'm so sorry - I took the credit card receipt by accident - so you didn't get a tip!  I will swing by before I leave town and make it right with you!  Tell your boss I said you need a raise.  You were great!

Service was excellent as was the food.  They quickly accommodated our group of 7 with prompt, attentive, friendly service.  The menu had several items that appealed to the group.  I selected the prime rib - and was pleased with the flavor, presentation, and quality!  Great place to take folks to dinner!

Hideaway is right.  You either know where it is - intending to arrive there for food - or you'll completely miss it.  Seating is interesting - bar area was full - big copper top table for 8 is open - and you share your meal time and conversation with others sitting at the same table.  Not really a problem, common in other cities - but new-ish to me here.  That aside - great service - and I loved my New Mexican Platter - Tamale, relleno, green burro, rice and beans, with combo green and red chile.  On the spicy/hot side - but expected that knowing the other Richardsons's menus.  All components were solid - but didn't make me stand and shout that I can't wait to go back.  Other diners were less pleased with their meals - one indicated his chicken was rather dry and flavorless... I'll encourage him to write a review.  I'd go back... but there are still a lot of Mexican/New Mexican places I'd like to try first...

Food was fantastic ... had the monthly special - Short Ribs and Green Chiie Mac and Cheese and the chicken breast dinner with potato cakes.  Both of us loved our meals, but the margaritas were WAY over priced ... small and really not that good for what they are charging.

Been here a few times - meals have always been great - love their happy hour.  Great patio to sit outside when the weather is nice and enjoy the view.  Service is always fantastic.    However... I have to mention my fajitas the other night... O M G ... I don't consider myself an expert on proper fajitas ... I just know when they're done wrong - they're really wrong.  These were incredibly delicious!  I shared a SMALL taste with my dining companion.... he agreed that they were awesome!  I don't know what they did .. but I do promise - I'll be back again and again and again.  Headed over tonight to a 4 course meal and tasting hosted by Herradura Tequila... I can't wait!

I pulled this based on reviews.  I should have taken the clue that "ideal for greasy Chinese food" was NOT what I look for.  For me - Chinese food is crisp, clean, and screams fresh.  None of that applied here.  Don't get me wrong - it's edible.  Doesn't give me any reason to avoid it, but it didn't make me want to come back again.  The crab puffs were the highlight - but again - those tasted as if they had been cooked earlier and had been sitting.  I didn't taste much crab either.  Portions were generous, staff were great, food was hot.  But I have to say - when I order Orange Chicken - I best get a taste of orange.  I didn't.  It was so sad to have to say ... meh.  Next.

Service was great.  Loved the trivia night. My problem is the food and furnishing.  First - ordered the "Shepherds Pie" .... grainy thin mashed potatoes over hamburger/veggies that was over cooked and under spiced.  Little to no flavor.  Covered by a boiling hot thick layer of shredded cheese.  No Bueno.  My dining companion had the guiness chicken.  He questioned if the chicken was cooked through.  It was rubbery.  Flavor on the sauce was ok, but the veggies tased old - as if they'd been in the fridge for a few days.  Sorry - not a fan.  The table where we sat was showing it's age - the finish was wearing off and everytime I bumped up against the edge - my shirt pulled a few slivers off and imbedded them in the material.  I spent a few moments on the ride home pulling them out.  A good powerwash and some dusting might help as well as some maintenance work on the furnishings.

1.  IMAX ...?  Really?  I was expecting a big screen.  Sound was ok though. 2.  Chairs are not very enjoyable for a movie - especially a LONG movie.   3.  Ordered food.  Figure it out guys.  Pick up "down there"  go there - and there's no number or name system - just staff yelling "Nachos.  Who had Nachos" or yelling "can you move - we're taking orders over here"  .. there's  no place to move to - except out of ear shot of the folks yelling "who ordered nachos" ... lame. 4.  Your food comes out in spurts and fits.  By the time your chicken tenders arrive, the pizza is cold.   5.  Speaking of the pizza.  Hmmm... crust ok, but pizza sauce isn't much more than tomato sauce.  I shouldn't expect much.... but I expect more than that.  I'll go back to Harkins 101.

F A I L ...  Yelp - can you give me a "zero stars" option?  Last minute decision - my sushi place across the street was closed (grrrr) ... promptly seated.  10 minute wait for water.  10 minutes - and I had to go ask for a server.  The guy who shows up finally says "this isn't my area but I'll take your order" ... we should have just left... but - hunger overruled .... so sorry we did not leave.  Chips were hard and flavorless as was the salsa... our meals - not good.  My chile verde was "ok" - but nothing special.  My dining companion ordered the Carne Asada.  No flavor - tough.  So bad - he couldn't eat it.  But funny thing - NOBODY stopped by to ask and check in - until I had to track down the check.  He offered to make something else - but by then - we were over it.  At least he took that meal off the check.  FAIL.

First visit - happy hour - we had several items on the happy hour menu and were quite 'happy' ... however... visit number two left me not so happy...  Brunch on a Sunday morning.  Seated promptly.  Chips and salsa - really good!  Loved both types of salsa offered.  I ordered the crab cake Benedict ... mehhh ... I've had a LOT better.  Egg poached perfectly.  The chipotle-wine hollandaise was ok, nothing special.  The crab cake, however, was mushy, thin, and I could barely taste any crab.  A spoonful or two of potatoes (but they tasted ok) ... and the best part of the meal - a cinnamon fried tortilla with fruit.  The complementary Bloody Maria was good.    My dining companion doesn't care for eggs, so he ordered the only thing on the brunch menu that didn't involve eggs. Chilaquiles (Chicken, sautéed tortillas in salsa tomatillo sauce) - came out while he was away from the table.  I was floored - and took a picture in case there was a discussion with management.  A FEW chunks of chicken, tortilla chips and a bit of tomatillo sauce (and the same small portion of potatoes and fruit/tortilla) .. I couldn't believe that what appeared to be a small portion of green nachos with a chunk or two of chicken was considered an entrée.  At these prices ... not sure I'll be back.

Mostly due to the service.  Here goes.  Late night (july 3rd) we are returning from a day at canyon lake and not much is open this time of night.  We stop in - only 6 other people in the restaurant, but it takes 5 minutes to be seated.  Server takes our drink orders, and I ask "Do you have a seniors menu?" Don't know if I qualify but just in case I do - I wanted to order something with a smaller portion.  Servers response is "Yes", and starts taking orders from others at the table.  Ok - I should have said "If you have a seniors menu, could you please get one for me" to be more clear.  My bad.  So as she comes to me I said "You said you have a Seniors Menu.  Can I see it" to which she replied "Do you want me to get it for you" and I, of course, said "Yes".  She said "I can do that but I think it ended at 6pm" or something like that.  OMG ... It's like pulling teeth here!  I finally order Huevos Rancheros.  It comes on a flour tortilla folded up underneath the eggs.   VERY THICK tortilla.  Where's the traditional corn tortilla?  Impossible to get the server to come out to the table for a water refill or to ask for sugar free syrup.  I guess she was too busy now that there were 3 tables with a total of 10 people in the restaurant.

Trying to decide what to do for dinner the other night ... we settled on Chinese.  So at Flo's - we selected Lemon Pepper Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken.  We shared both dishes - and both were loaded with flavor and just hit the spot.  There was not one morsel of food left on either platter.  Can't wait for the next visit!  Service was great, and It's nice to see the owner circulate and ensure service and food lives up to her expectations.  Well done!

Three strikes - you're OUT!  A few years ago - I discovered Sweet Tomatoes.  Great idea.  A little over priced, but the selection was so wonderful - take what you like and make a fantastic salad with a nice side of soup.  I'd run down from my office in Lake Oswego, OR or from my home in Salt Lake City.  Those days are over.  I ended up with this same experience in Utah - and vowed I'd never go back.  In Oregon, I was consistently pleased with the offerings.  Occasional misses, but it was good.  I don't understand it.  Do these people taste the food they send out?  Has the official taster lost his/her taste buds and is clinging onto their job for dear lire?  The ingredients look fresh.  Everything.  But when I try the pre-made salads - usually - they're bland.  Really bland.  Potato salad that tastes like it was sitting in a water bath after it was seasoned.  A Sriracha salad ... flavorless (REALLY - a BLAND SRIRACHA SALAD?).  Broccoli salad - ok ... but way too sweet.  Each time I've tried a different "Homemade" dressing.  They  generally come up thin and virtually flavorless - I'm thinking - is this where the water flavor is coming from for the salad.   Last night i tried the Blue Cheese - homemade.  I added blue cheese crumbles too!  I ate about 10 bites of the salad and pushed it aside.  Over to the soup line.  Tried the Corn Chowder.  YUK.  It had a "seafood" overtone.  Really?  It tasted as if someone had used a seafood broth as they had run out of a vegetable or chicken broth.  Not good when you're expecting a corn chowder!  Chicken noodle looked like chunky water.  I passed on that.  The chili was ok.  I prefer Wendy's chili to the bowl I got here - but - hey - I was hungry by this time.  The flat breads were ok, but lost my appetite for the potato when a kid - too young to be at the buffet by them selves - was using their fingers to select product.  I tried the mac and cheese.  It was edible - but again .. bland - and soupy.  Kids would probably love it.  I topped my night off with a small bowl of vanilla ice cream with a scoop of apple crumble - which was quite good.    This watery/bland salad line has been my experience the last three times I've been craving a salad.  I'll not waste money here again.

I wonder if it helps to mention that we ate here twice over the 4th of July weekend for brunch?  Service was fantastic both times.  The food is just as delicious as it is varied.  The Lumberjack is perfect for someone with a big hunger to fill.  The quinoa bowls perfectly yummy - a great departure from the usual brunch fare.  I applaud them for the presentation, quality, price, and service.  We'll be back!

I like to go to different places - rarely say "lets go back" unless it's really good.  I love to "go back" to the Pita Jungle.  Fast. Fresh. Great service.  Replace the rice on the plate with extra grilled veggies.  Yes - no problem.  The Caribbean Chicken Salad... FRESH cut fruits (TONS) over mixed greens, topped with shredded coconut, raisins and strawberry vinaigrette (I added broiled chicken) ... awesome.  Fruit was so fresh and perfectly ripe I wondered if they picked it off a tree in the back yard.  NEVER i been disappointed with the food there.  It's busy - so if you're trying to do lunch on a weekday - go early, a little late.. or plan on a nice wait.  It's worth it.

Had combo steak/chicken fajitas - lunch portion.  Fantastic!  One of the best plates of fajitas I've had.  Only problem - the $10 lunch portion is HUGE!  Enough for two meals!  Ended up here as Tia what's her name is closed in Mesa now.  Great alternative!  Great service, great prices, and great food.  What more can you ask?

Fabulous.  Fantastic.  A group of six. 4 of the six had the trio of Elk, Beef, Bison and loved it.  I had the flat iron special.  Fantastic.  Only complaint - the beet salad was very LIGHT on beets - but they were fantastic.  I could have done without the cabbage piece of it - very nondescript - but the beets were fantastic.  Also, we were celebrating a birthday and brought a bottle of wine as a gift - not to share at the meal, but as a gift.  We weren't allowed to bring it in - I'm hoping it was liquor laws that forbade it.  If we had it in a bag or wrapped - it wouldn't have been a problem.  interesting.  But overall - a great meal!  Highly recommended.

Ok ... Dining companion had Pancakes and they are fantastic... But the bacon was quite greasy.  So I give one star...   I was with other folks for dinner and I just wanted a snack. Ordered the mozzarella sticks... Simple enough.  They came out looking fantastic! Golden brown, nice round shape... One bite and three things were clear... 1. The consistency is wrong 2. The flavor is wrong. 3.they were barely warm.  The server never shows up to refill water, the weak coffee, or to check on us.  Only 6 other people in the restaurant! We had to flag her down. She admitted the sticks need to cook longer to melt whatever that scientific mess is they call mozzarella... But if they do - the outsides become very dark and inedible.  Kudos that she owned up and credited it off the bill.  That's the second star.  IHOP ... You know better.

Stopped in for a quick lunch.  I ordered the Generals chicken.  Very good!  Egg-roll was  relish - it was obvious it was cooked in fresh oil.  Thanks!!  Dining companion had a yellow curry and enjoyed.  We'll be back!  Great job!

Hmmmm don't know what's happened ... but the last two times - the meals have been just so-so.  Ordered the same things as usual - but just didn't have much flavor.  The pepper beef was forgettable.  The egg drop soup.  Flavorless.  There wasn't anything I'd return for.  I've had better there in the past (frequently).  New chef?  I don't know.  One more time - I'll not go back if it's the same.

Fantastic food.  Valentines day.  Reserved table, and it was ready on the spot.  Only complaint - extra tables were brought in to increase seating.  All good - except - our table was in what was normally a walk way.  It felt like grand central station.  Also, the temporary table was so small - it had barely enough room for our dinner plates and silver... add a drink, glass of water, condiments, appetizer, salad, etc - it became a challenge to juggle the table without spilling anything.  Ordered the Spinach Chorizo Dip - fantastic flavor - fresh - but the spinach leaves were left whole - and by the time it cooks - there's long strings of green that makes it impossible to dip and scoop ... using the fork helps - but you have a pile of green to load onto a chip... please chop the spinach - it would be tons easier to eat!!  The Chimayo Chicken and the New Mexican enchiladas were fantastic - but the house salad as so-so ...may have been due to the volume of meals that night - but nothing special.  Overall - a great meal.

Took friends here for lunch ... It had been a while since my last visit and wanted to try it again.  So glad I did!  I ordered the New Mexican Platter ... Everything was perfect as I expected.  The right amount of heat, spice, and temperature.  Too often foods are over or under spiced, or too salty, too cool.  I love it when they get it spot on.  Dining companions had the relleno platter and the Santa Fe chicken.  Everyone was pleased with their meals.    I did order the GCP (Green Chile Potato) .. It was good, but didn't blow my socks off as I had expected.  Don't get me wrong - I just won't order it as an additional side item.    Overall - kudos on a great meal and great service!

I love this place.  I may not be a purist as far as sushi goes, but I know when I've had a great, satisfying meal.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again.  5 - 8pm - Happy Hour menu - great prices, great sushi and great drinks.  Try the garllic edamame - fantastic.  jalapeño Tuna roll?  Awesome.  We enjoyed the gyoza, crouching tiger, sesame chicken, tiger roll ...  all were fantastic.   If you like wasabi - ask for the fresh crushed wasabi.  I didn't use one drop of Soy Sauce - the food was so fantastic I didn't want to cover any if the flavors the chef created for me.  The hostess was fantastic - even remembered me from previous visits - which have been 6 months in between visits.  Great music, decor, non-obtrusive TV's let you watch a game or other show while eating if you wish.  Great way to start your Vegas evening.  I'm a fan!

Three stars since previous experience was good - but one star down for an issue today.  Food is ok - about what you expect.  I ordered the Happy Family asian lunch.  It was ok - smallish portion and flavor was ok - somewhat muddy.  The "Spring Rolls" are 5 bullet sized (and strength) morsels that are not what I expected.  Over cooked and really not much more than one or two bites.  For the 5 bucks - I'll pass.  The bigger problem was my dining companions meal.  The Thai salad ordered looked great - he ordered the chicken addition.  All well - presentation is great.  But that's the problem.  The bowl used is one of these fancy-pancy ones where the front is much lower than the back with a small 'foot print' on a small square plate.  The salad is loaded "back heavy".  You use your knife/fork to cut the chicken - and it all flips forward - filling your lap/shirt/table/seat/floor with dressed salad and chicken.  Brought the issue to the servers attention - no offer to replace/reduce($) the salad... and I wonder if management will hear/do anything with the information that the bowl selection for the salad is not good.  Thumbs up for keeping the soda filled ... and for the dealer busing on Black Jack!  But the meal today...  Fail.

Let me first say it's nice to have something convenient when in town, and.... the service is great!  Ate there last night - and the server was fabulous.  My only complaint - it seems the chef likes his dishes on the sweet side.  Pumpkin Jalapeño soup was highlighted - but too sweet - and not enough jalapeño.  The bread at the table was fantastic.  Love love love.  I ordered the veal dish.  Very good - again - a little on the sweet side - would have liked more capers.  Dining partner ordered the short rib gnocchi "stew" - again - too sweet - and a bit much of a cinnamon flavor.  May be what was designed, but not what was expected.  They were totally cool to swap it out for the veal and not charge.  Based on how they handled us - we'll be back!

After all the reviews - some from folks that I respect greatly - I'm hoping this was just an anomaly... so here goes...  Food:  Chopped salad ... fantastic - but my dining companion and I ordered it to share, and when brought to the table, the server mixed it and divided it between the four diners - each just having a spoon full or two to taste.  Not wanting to embarrass anyone - we went with it ... but they should make note of that in the order and serve accordingly.  My short ribs were under-done - meat was cooked - but - short ribs require long and slow cooking to melt away the fat and leave the yummy goodness.  My meat was so loaded with fat that I spent most of my meal trying to find lumps of meat that were edible and separate from the heavy fat layer.  Fail.  The seasonal veggie appeared to  be swiss chard or something similar - tough - long strings - not a lot of flavor - not tender.  The parsnip puree was good.  Another diner had the meat loaf that the server praised.  Large portion - but very dense and not a lot of flavor - saved by the sauce from my short ribs.  Another companion had the filet and greatly enjoyed his.  Drinks:  Moscow mule - so so - not overwhelmed with that.  The Citizen cocktail was enjoyed.  The Tilia malbec, Mendoza, Argentina wine - "one note".  Not good, not enjoyable.  Those who had the Sazerac really enjoyed that - though it was a very small serving in a small glass.    Service:  Our server was great - but almost too "animated" for my liking ... but over all (other than the salad situation) - service was good - though it took a LONG time between courses and also to have plates cleared.  Atmosphere:  Nicely decorated and in a fun area of town.  BIGGEST complaint though is the noise level.  We couldn't hear the conversation of the folks sitting on the other side of the table - this after moving once to find a more quiet table.  There's nothing in the space to help deaden the sound - hard surfaces floor to ceiling - and perhaps - the architecture of the ceiling is the culprit.  Patio would have been nice - but it was taken by a private party.  Men's room needed a splash of clorox by the urinal ... Lastly - it was a bit on the warm side.  Not sure I'll go back ... hate to risk a good evening at these prices.  Wish I could have had the meal so many others seem to have enjoyed.

Called Tuesday and scheduled for 7:00 - 8:00am Wednesday AM.  Right on the dot, Trip (not what the circuit was doing but the electrician) was very friendly, fast, efficient, informative, and did exactly what we asked him to do.  Refreshing!    We're impressed with the company's service, price, efficiency, and friendliness.  Perfect recommendation from us.  He fixed a pool light issues, checked and replaced a suspected faulty GFI, and installed an additional outlet in the house.  Didn't leave a bit of dust or evidence of his work other than expected.  Thanks guys!

Authentic.  It's not a place you go to be immersed in beautiful Chinese decor - but it is the place to go if you want to enjoy fresh authentic Szechwan food.    Four of us enjoyed an appetizer plate.  You select from about 10 items at a little bar.  We chose pickled Lotus root, Marinated Cucumber, and Tofu thread.  I loved them - I really really loved them!  The lotus root was fascinating - it tested my chop-stick skills - but I was able to put away my fair share, thank you very much!  We had a pot of hot/sour soup.  It was very good - not too spicy (I would love a bit more) but it was loaded and very fresh.    Main courses - Walnut shrimp - was amazing.  Not over cooked - the shrimp were perfect.  Chong Qing Spicy Chicken (or Chong Qing La Zi Ji) It was a little different than I expected (no sauce) - but easy to eat - very tasty.  Lots of chilies but it's not overwhelming!  It left me with a little "tingle" in my mouth!  Next was a pork dish was called Hong Shao Rou or Mao Braized Pork.  Little chunks of fatty pork in an amazing sauce.  Loved in on my rice and scoop up a bit of sauce, rice and a bite of pork.  Fantastic.  If you're not a fan of the fat - you can easily pull the thicker parts off and enjoy ... either way - it's awesome!  (After everyone finished the pot - I grabbed a spoon and pulled out as much of the sauce as I could and ladled it over the rice... O M G...) We also enjoyed a potato dish - Potato and Garlic Oil.  The potato was in threads similar to spaghetti - not raw but not over cooked - you could easily pick it up with your chopsticks.  I loved the flavor and crunch!    The very best thing was the fried green beans.  O M G ... I couldn't get enough of them - cooked perfectly - enough to not be raw - but still leave a bite.  The thin layer of flavored coating was incredible.  We ordered two plates of beans... and two of the shrimp... and two of the chicken.    Don't judge!  It was awesome - and I skipped lunch that day so I deserved it.  Don't miss this place!  Some of the menu items can be a bit off-putting for us that don't have the experience or fortitude to try them - I'm sure they are just as great as the things we did try - but rest assured - you'll find LOTS of items on the menu you'll love!  I'll be back!

I like Carl's Jr.  I do ... guilty pleasure on a rare occasion.  HOWEVER ... it's so sad when you pick up your order in the drive through ... $13.72 worth of food for two... and the $6 Jalapeño burger tastes like the meat was cooked ... say ...  1/2 hour ago in Tijuana ... and not even kept under a heat lamp for the trip north ... and the fries ... are ... luke warm. And the Teriyaki burger?  Tastes like it was glad to be on the ground from a long flight from Tokyo.  sad.  Next time I want to load up on carbs I'll head south to In-N-Out ... ya - that's it!

Ok ... so I was on my way over to the Ben Avery shooting range ... and stopped in here for breakfast.  I know - I didn't review well before - but I was looking for a bite before heading out into the sun.  Couldn't decide what to order - and asked Cody for assistance.  Cody was the cashier - and steered me to the (I believe it was) loaded breakfast burrito.  The food was great - and I left satisfied.  The key to this review, and the reason for the added stars - was Cody.  What a helpful, pleasant, professional, hard working guy!  I hope the manager/owner of the location is paying him well - he's an asset to the business.  I'd hire the guy on the spot - he didn't stop working - the whole time I was there, and couldn't have been more pleasant to customers.  Great job Cody!

OK - no - it doesn't have a Michelin star ... but that's not what I'm expecting from a Diner... but if I were to compare it to others I've been to - one of the top for sure!  First - the location is easy - lots of parking and shopping.  The service was fantastic.  Some of the best I've enjoyed.  Staff were attentive, quick, friendly, and very helpful.  I noted that many of them were stopping by each others tables to check in, offer help, etc.  I noted several regulars in that many of the staff knew them by name.  One couple drives over every Saturday morning for brunch - 45 minutes each way!    I had the chicken fried steak.  Cooked perfectly.  Gravy was VERY flavorful.  Eggs just as I asked, and the hash browns were perfectly cooked.  My dining companion had a skillet (I hate to say I can't remember which one it was) - but both of us said "wow" after our first bite.   Water and coffee cups were kept full.  Table was kept clear - but never felt like folks were "hovering" ... I asked for the manager - he/she wasn't on duty that time - but they sent over the senior staff member there that day and I think she was thinking "oh my - a complaint" lol.. but I had nothing but praise.  She filled me in on many of the inside stories... owners who are passionate about their food and service, food that is prepared fresh onsite - no Sysco can's and buckets!  I noted a couple of notes about the french fries... I'll have to try them myself and see - that's one of my pet peeves - gotta do the fries right if you want the other ingredients to shine when they're on the plate.  They offer nice weekend drink specials and lunch and dinner specials each day.  I'm looking forward to the next of many visits.  Great job!!

Great location, comfortable, clean, and we'll decorated.... The food was fantastic! High quality, we'll made rolls.  Soy was high quality, the tea flavorful, and the miso was best I've had.  I'll be back!

Ate here in December - had a great visit.  a group of 6 - everyone ordered different meals but everyone seamed please.  Mine was a little over cooked - dried out a bit - but not so bad I wanted to complain.  Nobody else mentioned any issues.  We shared a Bannoffe desert.  FABULOUS!

Looks like they have had a rough start at the new location - not our experience.  Two of us for lunch ... both with BIG appetites.  Ordered the Pablo Picasso salad and shared.  O M G .   So good, and so much food.  That's all we needed for lunch to satisfy us!  Great food, great service.  I am amazed each time I drive by at the lines there.  For a new location - to be flooded with customers - it's a great sign.  Keep up the good work.  I'll be back!

Solid.  Tasty.  Fast.  Filling.  Clean.  Friendly.  Ample parking. Comfortable.    Received a complimentary meal at their new location.  So glad I was able to attend and check it out.  The owner was very friendly and knows his stuff.  Staff were great - still getting their sea legs but handled a large crowd quite well.   Had the pasta carbonara - solid.  Could had had a little more sauce but the flavors were spot on.  A LARGE serving - enough to take home.  My entree came with a Caesar salad side.   One of the best I've had.  The deserts were fabulous!  LOVED the cheesecake.   Can't wait to go back and try the lemon bar.  It was calling my name from the case.  Had a small M&M cookie too..  Yum!    And... They have Diet Dr Pepper! Score!!!    I will go back without question.  You should too!  Now off to walk around the neighborhood so I can go back next time without guilt!  Have my eye on the Asian pork sandwich... It looked awesome!

Having lived in Portland, OR the last 5 years - I've become somewhat of a food-snob and sometime critic. I loved living in a town that is known for it's fantastic dining - unique food trucks - and utter lack of national chain restaurants.  Moving to Phoenix was a good thing - I love the cactus, the sun, and swimming pools.  But I also love exploring new locations to dine.  I enjoy exciting menu options - new things I've never tried, old familiar things that are re-created, and old familiar things done just the right way that you expect.  How excited I was to receive an invitation for a complimentary lunch at the new Scottsdale location of the Thirsty Lion Gastropub and Grill!  I have to admit - I was a bit pensive thinking of how my previous experiences would translate to this new location.   Walking in the front door - all concerns disappeared.  Staff at the front of the house were efficient and friendly.  Just what you expect.  We were given a choice of seating locations and selected one by the window.  They even have some outdoor seating that would be fabulous in this wonderful spring we're enjoying.  Our Server - I believe it was Matt C - showed right up as soon as we sat down and took our drink order.  Matt was just like the others we had met - helpful, easy to chat with, efficient, and present when he needed to be without being a "helicopter server".  We reviewed various appetizer options - I was impressed with the list.  We quickly settled on the tempura beans.  While we waited for them - we reviewed the menu.  I noted that I was pleased with the number of menu options that I had to choose from - not too many, not too few... just right.  And very enticing.  I love it when I have a hard time choosing between several options - rather than trying to zero in on the least offensive one!  The appetizer came out suprisingly quick - hot, tasty, and an appropriate amount for two people with an appetite.  I would have preferred they had a little less batter - but not so much i hesitated to eat them. They were awesome!  The dipping sauce served with them was very very very good.  We next narrowed down our main courses.  Dining companion went for the fish and chips - I struggled between the enchilada stack - it sounds awesome - and the Reuben.  Matt said both were solid - but he LOVED their ruben.  Ahh - it's March.  St Paddy's is coming up ... and since I had had a nice big meal last night - I hoped that the sandwich would serve a purpose - to fulfill it's role as a delicacy that "a king uses to purge himself of the "demon of gluttony". "  Sorry ... this sandwich was so good - I believe their Corned Beef did the opposite to me.  I asked for a side of grain mustard - I don't know if it's home made or not - Matt told us that they use fresh product everywhere on the menu.  It shows.  The bread was the freshest rye I've ever had.  Every ingredient seemed as if they had labored for days to find the right product or recipe to complete my dish.  Loved the fries - but I just can't get over how much I loved my sandwich.   My dining companion had the fish and chips.  I tasted a bite with the tarter sauce and loved it.  Very solid.  He substituted the fries (which I LOVED with my Reuben) for a salad.  Blasphemy! lol... his salad was fresh and the dressing again - tasted homemade.  If it's not - they've found a great purveyor!   He filled up quickly - so I was able to taste his cole slaw.  OMG - seriously the best coleslaw I've ever had.  Too often it's over dressed, over sweet, watery, bland.  This was perfect.  I could go back just to have a side of slaw!  (Next time - regardless of what I order - I may just get a side of slaw!)  Desert was good.  He had the creme brûlée - very good.  I ordered the blackberry cobbler with an orange scented crust and vanilla bean ice cream.  Very very good - only criticism was that there was a little "too much" blackberry... but hey - i'd complain VERY loudly if there was't enough.   Service was solid - Matt was perfect.  Kitchen sent out the food very fast, well prepared, hot, and spot on.  Manager circulated through to check on all patrons.  Smart.  How else are you going to know how things are going.  I'm surprised more managers don't show up table side!  The location is fantastic.  Decor makes you feel like you're in a pub as expected.  Several tables filled - one with a very large group that seemed to enjoy just as quick service as we did at our table of two.  Bathrooms were easy to access and spotless.    Bottomline - Home Run! (Oh wait - that's what I need to do next - spring training games and then back to the Thirsty Lion for more fantastic dining.)    Thanks for the invitation Thirsty Lion.  It's gutsy thing to open yourself up to folks who like to critisize restaurants online.  You've got it figured out.  Bravo!  And thanks for bringing a bit of Portland to the Sonoran Desert!

When I pay someone else to make food for me - it better be good.  Fresh.  Flavorful.  Fast when appropriate.  Appetizing.  Filling.  Score!  I used to go to that place that that guy Jared plugged.  After having a Firehouse Sub - I realize how sad both the Subway sandwich and Jared are.  Since my first Firehouse Sub (I love the Italian - and I have them make it the "Fit and Light" way... as well as the Turkey Cranberry and the... Oh wait - everything I've had here I've loved!  Clean, prompt, courteous, and fantastic flavors and textures.  I love to add a little bit of the captain's sauce then have on the counter.  Every time I go at lunch the place is crazy busy.  We will call ahead/order online at times knowing this.  We've even gone to lunch early to miss the crowds.  I bet they wish they could double the dining area at lunch time!  There's a reason for the foot traffic.  You have to go out of your way a bit to go here.  Try it.  You'll like it.  I dislike chains ... but this one is a keeper.

Yelpers!  Score!  Thanks to the previous reviewers for the recommendation.  Very clean location in a "strip mall" - comfortable seating and clean - very clean!!  Score again!  Service was great.  Only "concern" would be if the place got really busy - our server/hostess/cashier would have a hard time keeping up.  For us - she handled things perfectly.  We ordered the Tom Kha Guy (spelling?) chicken coconut soup.  Spot on.  Chicken Satay.  Sauces were great - the chicken was a little overcooked - but still tasted fantastic.  I ordered the green curry and asked for additional veggies.  VERY  good!  Dining companion ordered Red curry and loved his food as well.  A third ordered a ginger stir fry.  Very good.  All of us were very full and took home a little for later snacking.  One of my new favorites for Thai in Phoenix!  This is a hidden gem - check it out!

I have to admit, I have my reservations about pizza places in general.  Lots of places think they do it right, few really make me want to go back for seconds.  And pasta... Who can't do it right?  Well - unfortunately, lots of folks can't!  That's why I was so happy to do this event ... I've now found a great option - easy to get to, lots of parking, clean, great service, great prices, great food, and BIG portions!  I had a couple of folks tag along and had food while I attended the event.  They LOVED it.  I was impressed as I saw plates of food go out to tables.  They really do feed you well.    I LOVED the meatball bruschetta, all the pastas were flavorful and cooked just right, but I have to admit, my favorite was the chopped salad.  One of my new favorite dishes!    Well done Sauce Pizza & Wine, well done!
