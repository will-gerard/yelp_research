I had such high expectations for this restaurant. My husband took me here for my birthday. The food was great, but the experience was not what I expected. The restaurant was behind with seating people. The hostess directed us to their wine bar and made us wait over 10 minutes for our table. The restaurant was about 1/4 full. Once we sat down, we ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairings. We waited 30 minutes for our first course, then the soup was served before we even finished the first course. The waitress made them take it back. Subsequent courses were served without the wine pairing and we had to ask for it. The entree took another 20 minutes to arrive. For my birthday they plopped a macaroon down on the table and it was just very awkward. We spent a lot of money on the meal and I expected the manager to comp some of our drinks based on how bad the kitchen timed the service of our meal. It wasn't our waitresses fault, but something should have been said to the chef. It should not have been a 4 hour meal. Food was great, but the pacing was really bad.

Excellent customer service! Bryant is great at this store. He even showed me how to set up the electronic I purchased. Great experience.

I am GAGA CRAZY for Sundrops Nail Spot. I love the decor, old movies, clean nail bar and the pedicure tubs are great. I never worry about hygene at this nail salon. I really like Carissa, Senthia and Kelly. They are so friendly, easy to work with and fun to get your nails done with them. The other nail techs are so friendly and fun. Carissa put gels on my fingernails, and they are actually growing! For a nail biter this is huge! I also like their boutique. Often the clothes are on sale, and they are always really cute. The dress I'm wearing today is actually from Sundrops! Don't miss out on going here. It's so worth it. They also have discounts on their social media sites, so check those out!

I went here last night for restaurant week. The menu was price fixed at $39/person. There were three appetizer, dinner and dessert choices. I had the scallop which was the biggest scallop I've ever seen, drenched in a fantastic sauce. It just fell apart. The barramundi was very flavorful, but my cut was a little sinewy. I finished the meal with the crème brulée which just melted in my mouth. I could have had three of those! My dad had the pot au chocolat which was a smoked chocolate mousse. It was very tasty but a little too bacon-y for me. Some bacon lovers would love it. Overall, I liked the atmosphere, service and food. I would definitely come back for one of their weekend themed dinners.

I've worked with Just-In Time for over 3 years. The company is a very reliable and affordable moving company. They are always on time, in range with their quotes and the quality of service they provide is beyond expectations. I recommend them exclusively to my clients, friends and family.

Terrible customer service. Lazy staff. Don't waste your time going here. 90th and Shea store is a little more helpful but staff isn't very knowledgeable on their product line. You're probably better off shopping online and doing it all on your own. In store pick up is at least convenient.

When you find yourself going to two different locations for one resale store in Phoenix in one day, you know the place has to be good, right?! I thought hte Arcadia store had it all, then I discovered the Uptown Boutique and it's like a whole new world!! Recently I bought a D&G dress that is just too darn cute. They sell everything from Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Rock&Republic, Nanette Lepore and more at really reasonable prices!! It's simply fantastic. I've sold a lot of my clothing and accessories there, and have made some really good money off of it (though I seem to spend it all in store!). They have fantastic locally made jewelry that is just beautiful. The staff and owner are amazingly friendly and so helpful. You are missing out if you're not shopping here!

I absolutely love going into Poor Little Rich Girl. The staff are incredibly friendly and they are all so helpful. A nice feature they have is to search for things in the store for you, so you don't have to do it! I don't know of one other resale store that will do that! It's incredible. They also have some of the best hand-crafted, locally made jewelry I've seen. I've recently bought severeal necklaces, earrings and gifts from them. It's such a great little shop. I tell all my friends to buy and consign there because you won't find nicer or friendlier people anywhere else.

In one word: magnifico! Seriously, Tommy V's food is to die for. Their short rib pizza is wonderful. I usually get the parpadelle bolognese with a meat ball. It's three different meats and a wonderful pasta dish. Recently I've been eating the short ribs with saffron risotto and wow. Just wow. The short ribs are so tender and just flake off. It's such a good combination with the creamy risotto. Their wine list is comprehensive with most bottles under $40.00. This is a great neighborhood restaurant. I would recommend it to anyone.

Terrible pedicure. My heels and feet are still stained black from my shoes. The massage was short.  Polish job appears to be good. Overall it was a very disappointing experience.   Staff was also unorganized for our group. 6 people booked with only 4 pedicure chairs available. I don't think I'll be back.

Great food and service! I really liked the eclectic menu. I had the briket crisp with mashed cauliflower which was delightful. The mixed drink selection is fantastic too. I really like their naked  (read: healthier) cocktail menu. Just remember naked drinks = healthy. Naked food = plain. So their macaroni and cheese is not healthy, but delicious! Ha!  The ambiance is very charming and comfortable. reBAR has a great patio. The whole set up of Bliss/reBAR is great.

My fiance is from the south, and when I say he knows his whiskeys and bourbons, he knows them. We love coming here for small snacks like the pickled tomatoes and duck fat fries (TRY THEM - they are so good!) and cocktails. I like their old fashioned. The bartender stirs the drink for two minutes. It really makes the whiskey softer and infuses the lemon and bitters flavors. Last week we tried the classic hamburger. I can honestly say, I don't think I could have made it taste better had a grilled burgers at home. It was flavorful, charred on the outside but still warm and pink on the inside. I love the casual, loungy atmosphere. It's a great spot to grab a bite and a cocktail or spend a whole night.

You're not going to be disappointed at Distrito that's for sure. From the margaritas made with premium tequilas and fresh squeezed juices to the flavorful meats, tacos, and ceviches, this place is a must go to for Mexican Food. Being a native to AZ, I'm super picky about where I'll good Mexican food, and Distrito hits a home run in my opinion. I also love the decor. It's kitschy and classy. It's such a fun restaurant. I'm getting hungry writing this review.

Be prepared. This is not TexMex. This is not a chain. This is a FANTASTIC local establishment that offers an incredible latin menu that will inspire your taste buds. For example: I hate almost all guacamole. But when it's made tableside and I'm at Barrio Queen, it's simply the best! The ingredients are fresh, you can get creative with what you want in it - like who'd think pomegranates and guac go together? It's simply wonderful here. My husband is a green chile verde connoisseur and he's always impressed with the flavor of the chile verde and quality of the carnitas. When the weather's nice, I love the patio and having a cocktail. Their drinks are always made with fresh juice and agave nectar which makes the 1,000 tequilas they have behind the bar taste even better!  You haven't lived until you've had Cochinita Pibil. Order it. Eat it. Love it! Then come back and order it again!

I have incredibly mixed emotions about Del Friscos. My first few brunches (I'm a glutton for brunch), were great. I enjoyed the meals and received a hand written note from the bar tender thanking me for coming to the restaurant and commenting on what I ordered. I was initially immediately impressed. My husband and I went for dinner and found the quality lacking and the service very slow. We were disappointed in the food for the price we paid. The last time I went, I had chicken and waffles. The waffles were great. The chicken was pieced together mixed meat mash of who knows what. It was not fresh, bone-in chicken which is what I expected. I think I ate more batter than meat. I did not enjoy it at all. I saw it was featured recently on Chow Bella as a top 10 Chicken and Waffles. Either Chow Bella has never had proper chicken and waffles or Del Friscos did some serious impressing.  I really want to like the restaurant for the location, roof-top bar and overall atmosphere, but I just can't do it right now.

You've never lived until you've been to The Stand. Burger: The Stanard with a grilled jalepeno is by far the best hamburger in Arizona. The Tacos are to die for. If you like corn on the cob, imagine it grilled and slathered in a cheesy herb sauce. Yeah... it's that good. Milk shakes are fantastic. The staff is friendly and peppy. You'll never go wrong here. Just try not to order everything off the menu. It's tempting.

they have a bacon board. read that three times and tell me it's not the best thing you've read all day. other than that stellar menu option, they have great southern bbq. it's not tex-mexicanized which is much appreciated for my north carolinian husband.   sunday brunch is a large mason jar bloody mary with a skewered slider, french fry, pickle, olive, lemon and lime with a beer back. they do not joke about brunch. that's what you get. that's all you need... maybe two... maybe three. you'll thank me later.

I am in love with this restaurant. The ambiance is incredible, very simple but sophisticated. The patio will be incredible in the cooler months. I went for brunch and was blown away by the ricotta pancakes and the crepe. I cannot wait to come back for dinner.

By far the best lamb chop I've ever had. Seasoned and grilled just right. a slight aoili on top. It is just perfection. You have to keep in mind that they're just a truck and grill on site to order. If the line's long, be patient.  It is totally worth your time.

I cannot say enough good things about The Saguaro hotel. The look is incredibly Arizona, playful and fun. I love all the colorful paint, decor, and the atmosphere just has an incredible vibe. The food at Distrito is to die for. The tacos and margaritas are probably the best in the valley. Old Town Whiskey is a personal favorite of mine. I love the old fashioneds. The head bartender is an encyclopedia of whiskeys and whiskey drinks. The pool is fun and relaxing. The atmosphere is hip, vibrant, but not flashy.  The staff are incredibly helpful and kind. If I could live in a hotel, it would be at The Saguaro.

They have The Prisoner by the glass. Need I say more?! Great pizza, love the hummus. The owners are funny Aussies. We're definitely adding this restaurant to our neighborhood rotation.
