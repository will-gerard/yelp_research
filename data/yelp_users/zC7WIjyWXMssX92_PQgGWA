Wow...I can't believe the rave reviews this joint gets!!! I am FAR from impressed...Hot giardenara? Is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich?! NO WAY If you want authentic Italian Beef catch a flight to ORD and go to Portillo's or Gene and Jude's... This place is sub-par at best! If you're looking for something remotely close to Chicago Italian Beef in Arizona, go to Tom's BBQ or Lobby's on Southern and McClintock...This place doesn't live up to the hype!  Don't waste your time! People who love it must not be from Chicago...

I decided to give Luke's another shot.....I am glad I did....I still hold true to my review about their Italian Beef, but their Hot dogs...now that's a whole different story!!! TRUE Chicago Vienna Beef Hotdogs with all the fixin's!!! A warm poppyseed bun was the first sign that this was the real deal! It was topped with Mustard, Onion, Tomato, Relish, and the true test to whether this is an authentic Chi Hot dog....CELERY SALT!! The cheese fries are like a local hot dog joint in Chicago called U-DAWG-U...SO GOOD!!!  Can't wait to go back and I am sorry for the negativity the first time around! :o)

The best italian sub since I went to a local deli in Chicago. It's family owned and they are the nicest people! I will definitely come back over and over again and I live in the East Valley!!! Support your local businesses! This is truly a hidden gem!!!!

Seriously the best burger I have ever had hand's down. They are so fresh and you can customize them to your liking. The man who makes the burgers is the sweetest and kindest guy! It makes me very happy to support a local joint especially when customer service exceeds my expectations!

I have got to say that every class I have taken is top notch!! The instructors really care about your health and fitness here and don't just show up as an obligation. You can see the passion they display in each workout! My stand out instructors are Trena (Yoga and Bodyworks), Kathryn (Spin and Bodyworks), and Robby! Robby is AMAZING! His bootcamp is like a bootcamp you would pay $100 for monthly except it's included in your membership! His class alone is worth the monthly rate! I admit the machines need some TLC, but other than that, I absolutely LOVE the classes!

I am a bit upset with this place. The sushi is fantastic and I would love to have more of it, but I get denied EVERY time I call an order in. Last summer, I called for a to-go order but they wouldn't allow it because of the weather outside.....ok......so I was a bit perturbed by this and tried again last week. Mind you it is February!!! I called for a to-go order again and the man who answered said "no, we can't do it. We are wayyyy too busy!!!" Excuse me?! I thought this was completely unacceptable and unfortunately, they have lost me as a customer. As good as the food is, it doesn't make up for this horrible customer service.

Soooo I didn't make the best first impression. Tamara probably thought I was a witch with a capital B. My appointment was late and I was on a break from work. So I was a bit frazzled from that. After we got through the extremely brief awkward period, it was a wonderful experience. I chopped 7 inches from my hair. I haven't cut my hair in 10 years. Next time I need a cut, which won't be 10 years, I'm coming to Tamara. She's professional, sweet and does an AMAZING job. I am in love with my short hair and I NEVER though I would say that. Short hair is not my jam on me. It's beautiful and I love Tamara! Thank you for not buzz cutting my hair after my terrible first impression!

Very quick and Morales is very nice. He gave me a personal recommendation for an auto glass place for my cracked windshield! I will come here regularly as no appointment was even necessary. I'm a last minute kinda gal!

I couldn't be happier with this amazing family owned establishment. Do not turn away based on the physical appearance. Once you walk in, you have a plethora of options to choose from! We had three rooms we wanted carpeted. Pat greeted us almost immediately and showed us around. She was genuine and showed us options that would work best and not based on price. Her husband came and measured our rooms and gave us an AMAZING price we couldn't refuse. It was by far cheaper than any other places we went to and we visited at least 4 other places. The installation took a total of 1.5 hours. They were so quick and did an efficient job!!! I love the quality of carpet! I couldn't be happier! We want to get new tile eventually and this will be our go to place forever!! Thanks A&P!!!!!

The owner alone makes me want to come back...He is the nicest guy ever!!! This place is hard to find if you're not familiar with it....It's 1 block South of Alma School in the huge Antique store!!! Super cute!!! I LOVE the Wild Willy. It's just buttery enough, the hotdog is so thick and tender, and the cheesy ham just completes it!! It's a must try!!! I tried the pierogies and i was not too impressed....But the dogs keep making me want to come back for more!!! I wish the hours were better, but i am sure it is due to the Antique shop it is located in.....It takes about 8 min for your order to be complete, but the store has so many cute gadgets to keep you occupied!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

This review is based solely on the workout classes. The teachers I have had are fantastic! My favorite is on Tuesday nights at 7pm with Marco! He really energizes the class and plays fantastic music to get you pumped. I think instructors and music can either make or break a class. Marco constantly inspires you to work your hardest in this Kickbox Cardio class. You will leave drenched in sweat and feel fulfilled. I am going to try Patrick's yoga class on Wednesdays at 5:45 starting tonights. I basically venture from different LA Fitnesses to find the best teachers! It is wll worth it! The only CON is it is usually packed from 5-7pm.

Their chicken chow Mein is delicious!! You can customize with different noodle types. The service is fantastic and very quick! I love their smoothies as well with boba! I definitely will come here on a regular basis. It's a bit hidden but on the northeast corner of Dobson and Warner!

Great spot for a quick lunch!!! I went in and ordered my meal and it took less than 5 minutes!!! So delicious for its price and the workers are so nice! I stuck with the simple rolls today - California roll, tuna and avocado, and tuna and cream cheese! They come four pieces to an order but each order is only like $1.50 or $2.00! I will definitely be a regular on work days!!!!

Omg I can't believe I am writing a review regarding a sandwich place within a gas station, but do not let that deter you!!! The BEST sandwich I have every had comes from this spot! I thought it was cliche to name a sub spot best subs ever, but they hit it spot on!! I got grandmas pot roast...the cheese, tender meat, and crispy onion straws blend together to form the most succulent sandwich of my life. Hate to cut this review short, but I'm on my way to get Grandmas pot roast!!!

Great service!! Great food!! It's been difficult finding Stromboli in Arizona but Brooklyn V's do it and they do it right!!! I had the Stromboli with sausage, pepperoni and meatballs! They did not skimp out on meat or cheese!!! It was oozing cheese!!! So delicious!! We will be back to try the pizzas and pastas which all look amazing! Everyone was super friendly and made us feel welcome. I even saw the owner come out and shake hands with patrons. This is why it's so important to support local businesses especially when they are as worthy as this one!!! Can't wait to go back!!

Oh Lou! Where have you been all my life?! Chicago! Thank you for FINALLY coming to Arizona and exceeding my expectations. I thought there is no way you could be as good as home, but everything was perfect. The sausage was delicious and the buttercrust melted in my mouth. Cheddar cubes were even on the menu! Mark Malnati was greeting everyone and the staff was passing pizza slices and bottled water to all the people waiting for tables! Now that's service. I have my Portillos and Lous. All I need is Superdawg and the only reason I'll have to go back home is to visit Wrigley! This Chicago girl is one happy camper. My waistline won't be happy, but I'll be back again and again and again!! Thank you Lou!! I love you!!
