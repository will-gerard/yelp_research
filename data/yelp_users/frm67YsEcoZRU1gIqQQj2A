Many of my friends dig Barro's Pizza and come here for a weekly lunch as a tradition. So I decided to tag along today to see what the fuss was all about and quite frankly, I'm not that impressed.  The hot wing pizza I had was overly greasy and rich. It became the undoing of my stomach lining, causing peptic ulcers left, right, anterior posterior, superior and inferior. There was no end in sight. Like Mordor, my innards became a barren wasteland devoid of life and happiness.  As the poison passed through my body, it erupted from me like the fiery lava of Mt. Doom. The contents that spilled out scorched me like a whip from within. Such pains and labors I had to endure until I was rid of this heavy burden. Even my friends that took me here no longer seem like themselves to me. I can trust them no longer. "Share the load," they keep telling me. But I know that this is my talisman to carry and nobody else's...  My time on the porcelain throne was a hardship I would not wish upon my greatest nemesis. The sight of a grown man crying is one of the most difficult to swallow. Gandalf's words kept ringing in my ears, "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" Indeed, I feared that this pizza would never pass and would become my burden to bear for all time. To grow inside me like a tumor and become a part of me. But thankfully, it eventually did pass and the tower of Sauron fell and we have peacetime now! =)  As for my rating of Barro's, nay. You shall not pass. You fail. Though I give you props for doing what few have done to my body. My immune and digestive systems are among the most proficient and powerful in all the land and you've bested both. Let Barro's name be heard and feared as one that will forever live in infamy.

Okay so I'm stepping out of my comfort zone to write this review since I normally review restaurants or food events exclusively. However, I felt that Taliesin West had a great deal of rich flavors and cultural significance that I decided it was worth raving about.  Well what's to say? Frank Lloyd Wright's winter home is a stunning piece of architecture that many can learn from and admire. The 60-90 minute tour is very fun and highlights Mr. Wright's genius thought processes in building design and also delivers several colorful and delightful anecdotes of a stubborn old man who had to have his way.  The pictures here are Yelp are gorgeous but half of the fun is listening to the tour guides explain why certain rooms are shaped the way they are and how the history of this place came to be. It's all fascinating stuff and I highly recommend it. Also, the gift shop has lots of neat doodads that might be worth taking home. It's all a little expensive, yeah, but if you're into art and architecture, Taliesin West is a really fun place to be culturally enlightened.

I once believed that the In N Out cheeseburger was the pinnacle of burger cuisine and that it could not be topped. In fact, if I were on death row and the time had come to request my last meal, I used to be the In N Out double double animal-style.  Chef Bobby Flay's Green Chile burger trumps In N Out in every way. Finally, a restaurant burger that's actually worthy of being called a restaurant burger. This burger is just bursting with awesome juicy flavor. So damn good. I'm going to get it every time I'm in town now.  Oooh. Also the goat cheese queso fundido is probably the best appetizer I've ever had too. Can't recommend it highly enough!

The Delux Burger gets the reward for being the juiciest burger I have ever eaten. This thing is like a meat sponge that's soaked up all the grease from the grill and the blood from the cow and it's quite amazingly awesome! Everyone knows that to have a good burger, you have to have good quality beef, which means humanely raised grass-fed cows. None of that grain-fed crap or that mad-cow cannibalism.   Also, be sure to ask for some extra aioli sauce because the burger is in desperate need of a condiment.  Restaurant itself is actually quite small so I could definitely see it becoming super crowded during the rush eating hours. But we went in-between lunch and dinner so we were promptly seated.   Kk the decorum was kind of gorgeous! Whoever designed this place has a flair for life and urbanism! The place has a very neon club lighting kind of style. And even though it's not at all subtle, it's still not over-the-top and in your face. The place glows with a blue light that enchants more than dazzles. Dig it, dig it, dig.

Matt's Big Breakfast is a nice, quaint little breakfast joint that does breakfast very well. A friend and I came here this morning and we were very much pleased with the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  We both ordered the day's special. It was a apple sausage scramble with spinach, a helping of hash browns, and some toast. Everything about the dish was very well done. The eggs were scrambled just right so that they were buttery, a lil creamy, and very fluffy. The apple sausage was just alright. It wasn't bursting with flavor and could've used a lil more heat or smokiness or something.   The hash browns are worth raving about though. The top layer of hash browns were crazy crispy which is always a good thing. But beneath the crust were some great gooey gluey but not soggy potatoes that perfectly complimented the crisp of the outside. The crisp:gooey ratio was flawless!  Even the toast was fantastic. Went with sourdough. Always do and forever will. The jam was made with fresh berries. The toast was thick and well-buttered. Went great with the freshly made jam.  All-in-all it was a good breakfast experience. It wasn't the best breakfast in the world. It wasn't super phenomenal or mind-blowing. But it was certainly above average so I'll give it 4 stars.

Wowie what an amazing pizzeria! These guys know how to handle ingredients well and employ them in amazing ways to create an absolutely phenomenal pie! Fantastic!!  LGO's also taught me a valuable lesson. Sometimes, the best pizzas aren't the meat-lovers ones but the VEGETARIAN options. What?! I know, I had to swallow a lot of pride to accept that but it is truth!  My Fallen Angel pizza with its yummy sausage just paled in comparison to my companions' vegetarian orders. The Mother Earth pizza is rife with just awesome vegetable ingredients and flavors. It was like a beautiful medley of music when I bit into a slice of that!  And the Rocketman with its garlic infusions, that was just clutch! I am in love with this pizzeria and cannot wait to go back!

Never before have I ever encountered a restaurant themed after mediocrity until dining here tonight at the Gordon Biersch restaurant. Our server, let's call him Manny, was so lifeless and chillingly disillusioned, I feared for his general well-being. The way he shuffled about on this Saturday night left much to be desired from his service skills. But enough about Manny. To the food.  The food was blandness itself. The only way to reassure myself that I was even eating food was through the mechanical motions of my mouth churning up and down and the swallow reflex. Otherwise, I'm not sure I had any experience with what could be called a meal at all. The sandwich I had was dry, like the Arizona desert surrounding this quaint little community. Its only redeeming quality was the avocado and ranch in my sandwich. However, when the taste of a sandwich stems not from the meat but from the sauces, it is a failure in my book. Condiments should be complimentary, not all-encompassing.   Praise must be given to the garlic fries, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole clove of garlic had found its way into my pile of garlic fries, which I promptly scarfed down. That clove of garlic was easily the best bite of the night.  Yes, I would return to this restaurant. It was not at all a negative experience. Just a shame that the server was a zombie and the food I had ordered was a little bland. I'm sure a couple of beers with some comrades would certainly enliven the experience for a 2nd visit. As for first impressions, the restaurant has made its mark on me, and thus, I mark it back with merely 2 stars.

Had brunch here and wasn't really expecting much. But dude was I surprised! First of all, the waiter gave us free champagne with free refills which my dad and I quickly capitalized on. Getting buzzed with dad yields some fine quality father-son time indeed!  Onwards to brunch. The selection was pretty standard fare. Some pretty neat create-your-own pasta selections. Was very impressed with the squid pasta. Had a very potent taste and at the same time was very delicate and fresh like seafood should be. My dad single-handedly destroyed Mandalay Bay's supply of crab legs as that is his absolute favorite food.  I think the highlight of the visit had to be the MOUNTAIN OF BACON. Yes. In the breakfast area, there was a heaping pile of bacon sitting under a heat lamp. I kid you not. Never before in my life had I ever seen such an unquantifiable amount of bacon ever. I think my heart melted from the sight... and then had its arteries subsequently clogged because SO MUCH BACON MMMMM.  Also had a couple bagels, very cold and creamy cream cheese with that, and handfuls of smoked salmon. Awesome treats. I'd give this buffet 5 stars if it weren't for the desserts. Bloody hell, those desserts were outrageously bad. Had to spit a good majority of them out. Most of them failed to rise above supermarket freezer standards. It feels like such a wasted opportunity.  People always seem to complain about the heavy price that comes with these buffets because they always seem to forget that these places are all-you-can-eat! If you feel you're being cheated, just grab another plate! It's a buffet after all so eat your fill! If you're not hungry, then why are you even at the all-you-can-eat buffet!? Go eat your girly salad elsewhere! =P  Anyways, it's definitely not the best buffet in Vegas. Check out Bellagio or Wynn for that kind of fine dining and whatnot. But if you're in the area and you're unwilling to drive to the center of the Strip in that hectic traffic, Bayside Buffet's definitely worth a look! (at least for brunch)

Came here for restaurant week and I very much dug the decor. Especially the wall of bottled spirits. That was kinda kickass and the only thing it was missing was one of those rolling library ladders.  The food itself was alright but nothing mind-blowingly spectacular. For appetizers, we had the chips and spinach artichoke dip which was extremely cheesy and creamy but not overpoweringly so. An excellent appetizer, I must say.  Next was the entree. I ordered the blackened mahi. It was topped with crab meat and tomato creole. Didn't really taste much of the creole sauce but the crab meat was pretty good. The mahi itself was kinda bland and didn't have much flavor. A friend ordered the citrus-glazed soy salmon or something and I had a bite of that and it was pretty good! But on the side, the honey-roasted carrots were super awesome. They were soft, gooey but not mashed gooey, sweet, and just very flavorfull.  And finally dessert, the white chocolate brownie was quite good. Complex in its design and presentation but simple in its taste. But sometimes, simplicity tastes excellent! What we have is essentially a brownie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and ribbon-like shavings of white chocolate. Can't go wrong with that, yeah?  So in the end, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars. The food, while good, wasn't spectacular and my mahi was kinda bland. But the dessert and the decor made up for it and it's a neat little place to take a lady out on a date to. Yay!

Mediocre breakfast. California bacon benedict. Avocado nuttiness drowned away by hollandaise. Hash browns not crispy enough. Bacon thick and good. Fruit was pretty legit actually. But the breakfast itself meh.  Breakfast is one of my favorite meals. It's so simple and yet it can be so exciting if executed well. It was with high hopes that I walked through the doors of Black Bear Diner. Upon initially entering the establishment, I was overwhelmed with bears. Bear pictures, bear statues, bear memorabilia everywhere! It was cute and welcoming so I went with it.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the food as charming. I ordered the California bacon benedict. Love benedicts and love bacon. Also love avocado. What can go wrong?  Everything went wrong. Well that's prolly too harsh. It'd be better to say that I was served a plate of mediocrity. The dish was drenched in hollandaise. Soaked the English muffin and made it soggy. Drowned out the nutty buttery flavor of the avocado. And it cascaded through the spinach. Gave it the texture of seaweed. At least it didn't kill the bacon which was cut rather thick and tasty. It didn't taste bad or anything. It just kinda didn't taste like anything. Just very slimy with hollandaise sauce. And the sauce itself was pretty bland too.  Also, a perfect breakfast can quickly go south if the hash browns aren't done right. And to do hash browns right, they need crispiness. The hash browns here are not crisp at all. They were crazy mushy and soft, failing to provide the complimenting crunch that goes so well with the thick strong creaminess of hollandaise over eggs benedict.  But it was served with fresh yummy fruit which was nice I guess!

Los Reyes de la Torta translates into the Kings of the Mexican Sandwich! And when they serve you that plate of torta, oh man, how can you not feel like a king?!  This thing is absolutely packed with every ingredient that they could've thought of. Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and eggs. All enlightened with tomato, onions, jalapeño and avocado. Ya it may seem like a massive cluster and it really is, but for some reason, everything works awesome together like a fully realized superhero team. So props to these guys for pulling it off!  Ingredients had to be fresh and good quality. Otherwise, the whole sandwich would've been thrown off. Especially the pork sirloin, that stuff was juicy and delicious and grounded the whole experience in deliciousness!  Definitely coming back once my gut heals from the distension because the size of these tortas are no joke and could trip up a giant!

This review will strictly be about the dish I ordered and nothing else. What dish was so terrible as to warrant a single-star rating, you ask? The Appetizer Trio.   Yes I know, it's only an appetizer dish, not a real entree. But generally, these appetizer sampler plates offer some pretty tasty food for a modest price and can be a legitimate meal on its own. But the Appetizer Trio at Margaritaville is abysmal and a disgrace to all appetizer platters everywhere.  It comes with 3 things: chips with a mushroom cheese dip, lava lava shrimp, and 2 egg rolls. But the portions are all out of whack. There's less than a handful of shrimp, the egg rolls are finished off in 4 bites, and the plate is overflowing with chips and the worst dip of all time. $15 for essentially a plate of chips and a couple random items on the side. Totally not worth it.  The dip was terrible. It didn't even taste like cheese or mushroom. Extremely bland and zero flavor. All it did was add a pasty texture to the crunch of the chips.  Lava lava shrimp was actually okay, but there was so little. They came served in this cup that was half filled with lettuce where there should've been more shrimp. Blasphemous.  And the egg rolls were decent too. Those came with a chipotle thousand island dip that was rather thick and heavy but very flavorful.  But the shrimp and egg rolls are eaten so fast and you're left with a mass plate of chips and really bad dip. Leaves you yearning for more and quite unsatisfied.  Margaritaville seems like a really fun place to hang out and Westgate is pretty poppin on the right nights. But this appetizer dish was just so astronomically horrible. Shame on you, Margaritaville.

The Toffee Bonafi stands two-massive-scoops tall as a monument and tribute to all foodie fanatics with or without a sweet tooth. Even Alton Brown, the greatest genius to have ever graced the culinary world, sings high praises of this incredible dish. And though my word is hardly as valuable as his, here are my two cents on the matter. =)  AMAZING! Absolutely gorgeous and well-thought out in its design and execution. Essentially what you have is two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream at the core. In its periphery, a myriad of toppings that include toffee nuts, speared bananas, whipped cream, and drizzles of salted butter caramel, all of it sitting in a waffle cone throne.  The greatest part about this dish is that every ingredient gets equal share of spotlight in your mouth. No single ingredient overpowers any other. It gives off a fantastic "team effort" assault on your taste buds that breaks through all your defenses and lets all your saliva spill out. Incredible.  Price is a tad high though. And that is my sole complaint. Otherwise, I absolutely must recommend that it be tried once in your lifetime. Make the journey out into the AZ desert, find the oasis that is Scottsdale, and prepare to be blown away.

I was very excited when I first walked through the doors of Dillon's. The energy seemed in excess and the atmosphere was just so lively. It was hard not to get excited! With patrons enjoying food and drink all around us, I was very much looking forward to my dining experience here.  We ended up sitting at the bar so we can watch the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics (which was dec). Service was very attentive and good despite the heavy crowds that night.   The food itself however was pretty badtastic. I ordered the baby back ribs which is kind of what they're supposed to be known for. While the meat was very lean, it wasn't very flavorful. Even worse, I struggled with trying to get the meat to fall off the bone cleanly. And when meat doesn't cleanly fall off the bone, that is a sign of ribs done wrong.   I'm willing to give Dillon's a 2nd shot and try their brisket or something else. But their baby back ribs were a big disappointment and I'd stay away from those.

Just moved from California to Arizona. They say that southern California has the best Vietnamese food to offer outside of actual Vietnam. So moving to Arizona, I had to leave that behind and settle for wannabe Viet restaurants and whatnot.  So when I found unPhogettable, I shuttered to see a pho restaurant title without a number after it and incorporating a terrible pun that makes my teeth grind.  But I walked inside and hey! It SMELLS like a good pho restaurant! =)  Ordered a bowl of pho tai and it was pretty decent! The broth they make is surprisingly flavor and they somehow use less MSG and fats than their Californian counterparts without sacrificing flavor. So that was a very pleasant surprise for me.  One problem is that the pho is slightly overpriced compared to CA. But if pho is what you're craving, this is the place to stop! ^_^

Their coffees are pretty good. I like my coffees black and their coffees generally have pretty good flavor.  But if you chase the milky sweetened coffee drinks, I gotta recommend the caramel machiato or the Himalayan Hammer. Hammer's one of their most popular products. It's got a chai tea holiday cheer to it and it's quite yummy. =)  Breakfast burritos there are okay. They do an interesting thing to their burritos and actually press it under a grill panini-style. It gives the outer tortilla grill marks and a bit of a subtle crunch sensation when you bite into it.   Ambiance is solid. They seem to have lots of art hanging up all the time and those are always fun to look at. Some of it is actually quite pretty too!  Also, sometimes in the morning, this super awesome mysterious old man sits at a table with a chess set and waits for challengers or something. And I feel like that kind of thing only happens at legitimate coffee shops hahaha!   Soooo ya. Solid coffee. Good study environment. Sometimes they have live music! What's not to like?

Postino Central is the pinnacle of perfection. It represents the peak of human endeavor and is worthy of every Nobel Prize past, present, and future. This is the highest praise, I know, but it is completely deserving because Postino is more than just a restaurant... It is holy ground. And modern science can prove that.  Bruschetta is, at its core, a simple dish. Traditionally, it is served as a slice of toasted bread rubbed with garlic, drizzled with olive oil, then topped with an assortment of ingredients. But Postino takes this minimalistic preparation to new levels, turning every slice of toasted bread into a dynamic canvas that highlights the finest quality ingredients. They offer eleven varieties of bruschetta, each with a signature taste to tickle your palate. And through the eleven options, there is not a single flavor profile that goes uncovered, no spectrum of taste that is lost. From savory prosciutto to herbal red peppers, dinner at Postino dances with your taste buds in every way.  My personal favorite - brie and apples with fig spread. The apple slices are fresh and the brie is so delicate. And the fig spread... Ahhh the fig spread gives a subtle sweetness... Then they all come together in that first bite, so sensual, so seductive. Like an exchange of honey betwixt bees or a whispered promise to your lover, the first bite is intimate... a pleasure you just may lose yourself in... And it's simply exhilarating.  Postino is a necessary part of the human experience. I feel that words cannot do this restaurant justice so my review will conclude shortly. Just know that should you ever walk through Postino's doors, you will feel the universe expanding in that initial bite. And don't forget to order a bottle of wine... Because bottled wine is bottled poetry. Bon appetit!

After a hard morning of rock climbing, my buddy and I ventured here to satisfy our sandwich cravings. He was once a student at Glendale Community College which is right across the street from this sandwich shop. As such, I trusted his opinion of the area and had moderate expectations.  I ended up ordering the Jamaican Red sandwich that was recommended by the cashier. The menu describes it as a sandwich construct of grilled chicken breast, green bell peppers, jalapenos, black olives, and cheddar cheese. Top it off with chipotle sauce. Freakin' delicious. A solid sandwich place with some not-so-subtle nods to weed, which is very alright with me!  To conclude, it's a solid sandwich shop. More than that actually. It's a quality sandwich shop with good ingredients, great flavors, and a fun atmosphere! =)  Note: Rumor has it that this place becomes crazy poppin on 4/20 and the lines become super long! But apparently they have a DJ as well for that day...?

I judge cupcakes on two criteria: (1) the quality of the frosting and (2) the moisture of the cake. Both of these factors, of course, sum up to a greater whole. It's hard to talk about the whole without dissecting it into its components. But if you don't feel like reading my whole spiel, I'll just sum up the whole in 2 words: pretty good!  I had the Oreo cupcake. 'Twas recommended by a dear friend of mine who raves about Sweet Daddy Cupcakes like every time we hang out. So there was some considerable hype going into this. Also doesn't help that Sweet Daddy cupcakes were featured on Food Network's hit show Cupcake Wars. Already the stakes are high!  So (1) the quality of the frosting. The frosting for the Oreo cupcake was actually quite delicious. It was unique in that it had almost a granular gravel quality to it since it was permeated with the microscopic crumbs of crushed Oreo cookies. But at the same time, it was still frosting as a whole and very creamy and alluring. Awesomeness.  (2) The moisture of the cake. This is where the cupcake falls short of excellence. The cake itself was moist inside but the outer layers were actually kinda dry. Maybe the batch I ate wasn't very fresh or maybe that's just the way it is. I don't know. But that's just how it got served and I wasn't thrilled about it.   Another note. The cupcakes here are actually quite big and a little tall. For me, a perfect bite of cupcake should extend from the top where the frosting is all the way to the bottom. And this aspect of design allows for good cake to frosting ratio. It's not a breaking factor but it's something to note for those of you with smaller mouths!  In the end, my favorite cupcake store remains the super-famous Sprinkles Cupcakes. But Sweet Daddy's is not a bad alternative either if you're in the neighborhood!

The Vig Uptown stands as an urbanesque chic castle at the northern borders of Phoenix, AZ. Its upscale decor and sunroof area exudes a modern flow of hip vibes and good times. The courtyard with the cornhole arena is an excellent touch. And the food... Well the food was dec.  I had ordered the hangover helper, a monstrous plate atop of which sat a tower of chilaquile layered with pork, cheese, sour cream, and housemade salsa. Then nested above this foundation were two over easy eggs. Was I served a plate of food or a work of art?  And upon first bite, the flavors were very good. The textures were varied - starchy tortilla against gooey cheese and shredded pork. And the housemade salsa made everything taste incredibly fresh.   But then halfway through the dish, I found the flavors began to lose their pop. The dish became heavily reliant on the salsa to sustain itself. It had very quickly begun overstaying its welcome... The chefs here must learn that less is more. While great proportions is generally appreciated, sometimes it can very often do a dish more harm than good. Pride is not the opposite of shame, it is the source. And the only true antidote to both is humility.  I'd definitely go back here but not for brunch. Rumor has it that they have a mean set of burgers that I'd love to sink my carnivorous teeth into...  To be continued...

This place has fantastic solid wings and a great selection of flavors. Ranging from mild honey BBQ to sweet with lingering heat mango habanero to the outrageously scorching blazing hot wings, this place has a flavor for everybody and their dog. Also, wings are 50 cents on Tuesdays which is a pretty awesome deal.  My go-to 3 wing flavors are Asian zing, Caribbean jerk, and mango habanero. All of them have a different kind of kick but it's all delicious. But if spicy isn't your thing, honey BBQ and parmesan garlic are other popular favorites.  This place also has a good variety of beer taps. From generic bud lights, light blue moons, and the bitter IPA's, they'll have something to complement your wings!  Good ambience. Often super crowded on a Tuesday night because of happy hour. But the trivia is fun and the walls are adorned with flatscreens on which to cheer for your favorite team if they're playing that night! Fantastic wings, good company, sports, good beer, all combine to create an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. What's not to like?? =D

Dad and sister came down for a surprise visit. Uh oh, totally unprepared. Gotta jump on yelp and search "breakfast" for a quick pick. Tryst Cafe comes up. Looks alright. Let's go!  And lo and behold, it is indeed alright! Ordered the Hawaiian Breakfast for $12. Came in a very trendy bowl that I guess I'd describe as egg-chair-esque, yeah? Smoked pork had great flavor and went surprisingly well with the rice, lettuce, and egg. Also, the bowl was lightly coated with a soy sauce glaze that just completed it. Awesome!  Service was very slow though. It took over half an hour after ordering before the food finally got to our table. By the time the food got to our table, people were already ordering lunch!  But the food was good enough soooo 4 stars! Yay!

Came here for lunch on a Sunday with 10 other rowdy bros of mine. It's a tad small but it is quite accomodating and has a very quaint and charming Irish pub feel to it. What makes it even better is that as we walked in, we walked past a table of 5 Irish guys ranting and drinking beers. The presence of real Irish people? Ooooh this place has gotta be legit!  Ordered the bistro chicken sandwich - made with sun-dried potato pesto, mayo, garden rocket, piquant peppers, smoked provolone, all served on grilled focaccia. MMM soo good! And the portions were surprisingly large for a dish that demanded $11.95, especially in Las Vegas!  I also ordred a side of sweet potato tots but those ended up being less than mediocre. Surprisingly moist and soggy rather than crisp. So I would skip that and go with the mashed potatoes or simply chipper chips (fries).   The dish also came with a side of a sauce called malted vinegar mayo which tastes exactly how it sounds. I was never a fan of malted vinegar but some of my buddies enjoyed pouring it all over their sandwiches. It's certainly interesting, not for me, not for everyone, but it's definitely got its niche! =)  So yeah, if you're ever in the vicinity of Mandalay Bay and you're looking for something relatively cheap that's not fast food, I'd definitely give Ri Ra a recommendation as it will probably give you the most bang for your buck! Also, the food is pretty bomb too!

One of the perks of living in San Diego is that you're always within a block's distance of a Mexican taco shack that's open 24 hours. Being so close to the border, San Diego was always keen on delivering some great greasy drunk Mexican food. Nothing like carne asada fries to satisfy your cravings at 3 am in the morning.   Well nowadays, I find myself roaming the suburban streets of Glendale, AZ, very much missing my Mexican food from southern California. And while AZ should boast some excellent Mexican food as well, Glendale in particular is lacking in yummy Mexican shacks with names that end in "-Berto's."  But then Señor Taco appeared from nowhere, as if my prayers had been answered. Lo and behold, their California burrito is one of the best I've had.   But oh snap, their surf n turf burrito is godly. Packed with super yummy shrimp with fresh citrusy flavor, all against the backdrop of a powerful carne asada background, and everything smothered in wonderful secret sauce. This place is the real deal.  One more thing. Free hot carrots. YESSSSS!!!!

My review is negative because it reflects the food. The restaurant itself is very nice. Well decorated and servers very attentive. Clean, good atmosphere. However, the food was very disappointing.  Shrimp Toast - breaded scallions with sriracha aioli. Very reminiscent of fried tofu with shrimp flavors underlying, which is definitely not a bad thing. Big flaw with the dish was the sriracha aioli. Tasted like pure mayonnaise. Completely brought the appetizer dish down. A shame. Good in concept, horrid in execution. Dump the sauce and just eat the "toast."  Wok Roasted Chicken Wings - Not bad, but not good. Wings were coated in a "Sriracha Hoisin glaze." The Hoisin was noted. The Sriracha was not. Lacking heat. Also, noted dearth of sauce. Good wings need a lot of sauce, its primary source of flavor. Positive points: wings cooked well and coated with a peanut crumble for textural dimension. Presentation admirable. Taste did not meet expectations.   Pork Ramen - mediocre at best. Noodles were extremely good, very creamy and filling. Everything else in the bowl was not up to speed. The pork wasn't seasoned, difficult to chew, and overcooked. Bowl had pickled daikon, a welcome surprise, but not enough to elevate the dish. Broth lacked identity, very watery.   Good Asian food in Phoenix is difficult to find. My review has been calibrated to the lower standards of Phoenix's Asian cuisine fare. 2 Stars means "I've experienced better." So yes, I have experienced better Asian food in Phoenix than the dishes at The Clever Koi. Very disappointing indeed.
