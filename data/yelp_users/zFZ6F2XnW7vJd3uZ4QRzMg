Had a good experience with them when I had a starter issue with my car. Then had an issue with a fuel injector failing.  They quoted $1100 to fix the issue and, at the time, made sense as the manifold had to be pulled off the engine. That was outside my budget so I checked with 3 independent mechanics.  All of them were amazed by the quote and each said the labor itself would be no more than $200.  Finally found a good mechanic and he fixed it in about 2 1/2 hours for $260 total including parts.  I can see some disparity between prices but the $1100 was obviously a huge gouge.  My car is a bit old so maybe they just did not want to work on it.  In any case, I will be using my independent guy from now on and not Marshall's.

Out for the night in Old Town for my Birthday and decided to stop by for a drink or two after dinner.  $5 cover charge which is understandable as they had a band.  However could not get service and every table was reserved even though the place was empty.  Sister in Law asks where we can sit for a drink.  Bartender replied that we should try Kazmierz, a wine bar across the street.  So, out the door we went to never go back.  Certainly will be letting all the friends know not to visit.

Have to say I love Bootleggers since it first opened.  I have tried the burger, pulled pork sandwich, pulled pork lunch special and the grilled cheese.  All were fantastic and the service is great.  The flavors of the BBQ have been good for almost every single time we have gone to the place.  Larry, one of the bartenders, has taken great care of us and I certainly will be going back to Bootleggers many times in the future.
