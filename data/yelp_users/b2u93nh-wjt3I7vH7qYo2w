This place has been a family favorite since it opened.  We stop by a few times a month.  The food is great, the price is right, and the staff is super friendly.  Everyone should swing by and check them out.

I'm an auto enthusiast. I enjoy working on and cleaning my cars.  Going to Clean Freak means that I'll have to do both afterwards.  First off, the wash is terrible for the price.  Just about any other car wash in the valley offers full service cleaning for the same price.  I have to finish cleaning my vehicles myself after going through this place.  I've only gone to this place because it's a few blocks from my home.  Never again after my most recent experience.  I took my Dodge Durango through the wash a few weeks back.  I parked the truck afterwards and my wife drove it the next morning.  She got on the freeway and heard a loud noise after a few minutes.  The stock trim around the front passenger wheel trim had torn off.  I would have thought it an odd incident if not for my experience a week later with my BMW.  After going through the wash, I returned home and instantly noticed that the front passenger marker light had been ripped off.  A week apart and damage on the same area of two vehicles?  It's pretty obvious that the car wash damaged my vehicle.  I called and sent emails without response at first.  The manager eventually called me back.  He argued that the wash couldn't have caused the damage. I sent him an email with photos of the problem and eventually filled out an incident report.  A week later, I've had no follow up from either the manager or the company.  I'm out a few hundred dollars because I chose to go through this car wash.
