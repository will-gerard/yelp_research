I have been suffering from chronic shoulder pain in addition to severe fatigue. Not sure if the fatigue is related to my hypothyroidism just yet, had blood drawn to check today but I have also had issues with adrenals in the past and have struggled with major lack of energy for some time. After weeks of chiropractic, massage and trigger point therapy to try and relieve my shoulder pain I decided to pop in to Dr. Lee's office. He was able to get me in right away and I left that first appointment with ZERO shoulder pain. We are still working on my severe fatigue but I expected that might take a little longer. I was so impressed though that I left there with no pain in my shoulder I referred several people. All of whom went for "pain" issues and said the same thing. They left feeling 90-100% better. I LOVE Dr. Kyesub Lee and am totally impressed with his skill. This is by far, the most amazing healing experience I've ever had. Thank you Dr. Lee!!

Totally love this place. Have been going here for a year or so now to get my kitties foods. Those little stinkers eat better than me but I'm happy to give them quality food. Love my Lil fuzzies and want to give them the best. For being a specialty pet food place their prices are great! Wonderful and friendly staff always! And they also do events on the weekend for your pet. Check it out...really cool place!

DELICIOUS!! Excellent cuisine and staff are friendly and efficient. This particular area of town is a little thin on healthy restaurants so I was so excited to find Cafe Mix. Chicken salads are wonderful as is everything else

Am giving this location a 5 because my regular therapist is awesome. Chris is the absolute best for deep tissue. Not many therapists understand or can really offer deep tissue for those of us who like that kind of torture. The massage is so theraputic I've been coming monthly for two hour sessions for the last year and a half.

Customer service was very poor. Maybe I came on an off day but none of the three attendants up front were very helpful today. Questioning if I ever want to go back now.

Had a perfect weekend in Sedona and was finishing it up at the talking stick. My overall experience of the resort was great with the exception of the spa. The customer service, attitude and communication of the spa staff was very poor. My main complaint is Terry the spa manager. Her management skills need some work as her communication style was combative and lacked balance. Unfortunaltley the spa staff are a bit snooty and lack good quality customer service skills. Would love to see the resort get some people I'm there who know how to provide good service!

Its a toss up between Cartel and One in terms of taste favorite. One however is very reasonable! Love the day old muffins for a buck and americano is always fresh and never bitter..yum! Most of the staff are friendly with the exception of two girls who seem to lack personalities but other than that I love this place.

The food and service were excellent! I do get a little bugged out by the amount kids and noise. Great place, service and food otherwise if you can deal with lots of people, noise and crowded parking lot you'll be OK.

Like many, I've been to many nail salons in strip malls and this by far is my most favorite place. It may not look super deluxe and is pretty simply decorated but what makes this place really stand out is the friendly staff! Love Mindy, Jenny and Tran! These people are soooooo awesome, they know my name and my moms name and ask us how each other are doing every time were in. Very personable and nice place! BTW Mindy and Tran (owners) do the best eyebrow waxing EVER! My eyebrows have never looked this good. Prices are extremely reasonable. Great great place

Great experience!  I wanted to upgrade my phone but didn't think I was eligible yet. Matt called me to let me know about the new upgrade program and the rest is history. This was the easiest upgrade process I've ever been through and I am highly highly impressed with the customer service!!! Thank you so much Matt and team. I will come to only you guys for all my phone needs in the future.

I don't know what has happened to customer service and problem solving but this place has certainly lost it! I used to be a patient for many years and felt "eh" about them but my experiences have most definitely declined. Time to start looking for a doctor or clinic that isn't concerned about the cattling in and out of patients. Very poor customer service and problem solving. Triage takes forever, especially if you just need a quick answer or resolution. I don't want my woman care needs to be in the hands of a center focused on production or service level numbers - in/out FAST.

My most favorite place to be besides sleeping in on the weekends. Excellent group of people here (staff and clients)! Seems like we're all one big happy family.
