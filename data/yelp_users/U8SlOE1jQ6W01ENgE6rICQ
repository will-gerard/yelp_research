This is one of my favorite airports for a couple of main reasons:  1. Easy TSA process 2. Fabulous restaurants 3. Easy navigation around entire airport including parking outside 4. Extremely efficient pick up/drop off areas with plenty of space for everyone   To expand on each thing that I really enjoy...  TSA Process: I frequently travel with just one carry on item and it's generally a process. I'm a frequent flier so I know how to breeze through the lines, if the airport recognizes this and lets me.  By that I mean doesn't stick me in a super long line behind people with a ton of baggage (or kids). (Sorry but it's true!)  Sky Harbor seems to "get" this more than other airports and frequently sends me and other people who don't have many items into a smaller, more quickly moving line.  Perhaps I'm totally wrong about this and it's just luck but it's something I've noticed after flying out of PHX dozens fo times.    Awesome Restaurants: Normally airports suck at food- they'll try to have options but instead of offering great restaurants they give you shitty options.  (I'm not sure which I'd rather have- no options or shitty options... probably shitty options.) Sky Harbor has a lot of options that are not shitty- not at all!  For example, last year they put in a Matt's Big Breakfast- if you're not from Phx or haven't visited or lived there for a period of time you probably don't know about the gem downtown that is Matt's big breakfast.  It is an awesome breakfast spot with bacon that is almost a half of an inch thick.  YEAH.  There are awesome food places in Sky Harbor and I always try to get there early just to eat.  A funny tidbit.... last year I was flying on Thanksgiving day and ended up having my Thanksgiving dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen outside of the TSA checkpoint at Sky Harbor- haha!  Easy Navigation:   This one is pretty straightforward so the point I'll focus on here is that they are a stop on the light rail that runs all across the Valley.  I have frequently used this system and have found it foolproof.  Rarely to I trust public transportation when trying to get somewhere with a tight timeframe but I absolutely trust the light rail system with the Sky Harbor drop off points.    Pick Up/ Drop Off Areas:  Long story short (I've already written a novel- about an AIRPORT - I'm crazy.) they have really easy pick up drop off areas that are heavily monitored for stalling and it makes it really easy to get space to get in or out of the airport quickly!   If you need to have a long layover this is the airport to have it in!

A big sigh and a "meh" which is the sound of me shrugging my shoulders and saying a begrudging "ok".   ^^ That's how I feel when people ask me to go to this place.  I am by no means a coffee snob which is probably why I really don't like this place.  All I ever want is either a) a normal coffee with sugar and cream or b) a latte/cappuccino that I don't have to make my "shot face" when drinking it.  (Does that make sense? I make a pretty ugly face when I take shots because they're gross and I don't want to make that face when drinking a coffee drink.)    Unfortunately I've never really enjoyed their basic coffee or their "fun" drinks. (And I've tried.  About every time I go I try something new.)  I really like the downtown location for the atmosphere and the food but found that this location did not match up to that.  This location seemed dark and quite frankly messy- everywhere I looked just seemed disheveled and a bit dirty.  I was going to order a brownie but was deterred when I saw a few flies and fruit flies in the case- which I totally get can happen and normally I roll with it but it was the icing on my unhappy cake.    I do not think I will agree to going to this place again..... maybe the downtown location but not this one.

I'm just realizing that I have WAY too many 5 star reviews but maybe it's just because I go to some amazing places.  This is one of those places.    To save whoever is reading this to consider going or not....  just go. Now.  You might want to consider making a reservation.  Stop reading this.  Run.     I effing love this place.  They do bruschetta like no one else does and their service and drinks are awesome too.  They are the rare triple threat- like if this restaurant were your girlfriend that you've been dating for only 6 months your mom would love her and all of your buddies would tell you to "lock it down".  Seriously that good.   My favorite bruschetta are the apple and brie and the "classic" tomato and mozzarella.  I generally get a pino grigio (house) or pino nior (house) depending on my mood.  I really need to try more of their menu but their bruschetta is so freaking good that I never get past it.    The normal every day deal is $14 for 4 different types of bruschetta.  It's a pretty big order- each bruschetta is about 4-5 inches long and it's cut into roughly 1 inch pieces so it's sharable and not messy.  I personally can fill up on just that but if you've got 3 people with bigger appetites you might want to order 2 orders.    You might want to consider making a reservation or be prepared to wait- in the evenings they get packed.    I moved from Phoenix to Reno this past year and this is the number 1 place I miss the most.  If they ever want to consider opening up a place here we have a superb foodie community and I know they would be welcome.    GO TO THIS PLACE NOW.

This is one of the best ice cream/ frozen treats I've ever had. Whenever I come to phoenix this is on my "go to" list and I love introducing people to Betty's famous Paletas. Make this a priority to go to! I love the strawberry and creme flavor the most.

Why are the other reviews for this place so bad?!  I had a pretty good experience.    I ordered an eggnog shake and a footlong hotdog to go and it was an easy ordering exerience and my food came out less than 7 minutes after I placed my order.  Eggnog shake was GREAT (was worried about it being too much) and the hotdog was surprisingly good.  (I was sober- it's rare when hot dogs are good sober- unless you're at a baseball game.)   Service was pretty good, food was pretty good.... overall a good experience!

I sincerely wish I had read the reviews and done my homework before buying a car here.    I purchased my Volkswagon Jetta from here almost 2 years ago (I know- buying a Jetta from a Subaru dealer??)  When I walked in I knew what I wanted- a white Subaru Forrester.  I was just out of college and had a good job and some savings that I was ready to put down. First, the sales person directed me to the used car guy on a lot nearby.  (I think they're all related) For the life of me I couldn't figure out why he took me there.  My mom and I were there together and when we walked in to this used car guy he was disgusting- he was using chewing tobacco and wanted to talk about my credit in front of 4-5 other people (employees??) there.  When I told him I wasn't comfortable with how this was going he told me this was how he ran his shop and I could deal with it.  I looked back at the first guy who took us over there (sales person from the original Camelback Volkswagen place) and said I'm not doing this and walked out.  He was sooooo apologetic and wanted to help us so we said fine- but we're doing it on your lot.    Fast forward 3 hours and I had purchased a 2010 used Volkswagen Jetta.  I didn't even test drive a Forrester.   I know I was swindled but unfortunately I was too dumb at the time to notice it.  Luckily, I freaking love my Jetta so I'm not having buyers remorse, just wished that I had been able to look at the Forrester.    The reason that I'm prompted to write this review now is because I still get promotional emails from them and it's extremely unnecessary.  I moved out of state and am just not their target market anymore.  First, I unsubscribed using the button on the bottom of the email.  (That was about 3 months ago.)  Then, after getting another email about 2 months ago I called to complain.  I talked to a man in the service department (I have no idea why it went there) and he agreed to take me off the list.  Finally, I got one more promotional email this week and being frustrated that they weren't respecting my right to unsubscribe I looked up the CAN-SPAM laws- and they were indeed breaking the law.  I called and had to leave a voicemail in customer service - when she called me back (and left me a voicemail) she said that she would indeed take me off of the promotional email list.    I've had a very frustrating experience with them and am not convinced I would return.
