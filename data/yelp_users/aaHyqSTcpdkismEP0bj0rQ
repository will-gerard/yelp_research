This place is legit. They practically spit shined my car for under 20 bucks. Get the basic wash and you won't be disappointed. They clean it inside and out.   also if you check in on yelp, you get 2 bucks off. You're welcome.

First off, the food is incredible. The menu is very simple and to the point. Don't let that fool you.   I got the sausage corn dogs. YUMMY. A must try. Also the fried green tomato sandwich. The bread they use is quality and so tasty.   I gave it 4 stars because I feel like the staff could be friendlier. And eventually, I'd love a bigger beer selection.   Try. This. Place.

This is my go to spot for Chinese food. It's always fresh and yummy. I typically get the orange chicken with rice. The chicken is white breast meat and not prepared the typical deep fried way. Also their soups are good. Everything is always great and super fast takeout!

Super nice crew. They filled my car up with some break fluid, free of charge, which isn't why I gave them 5 stars, it was their friendly attitudes and the fact that they were incredibly helpful.

This place is AWFUL. I'm sorry, there's just no nice way of saying it.   I picked up my food and while waiting for it, there was a man complaining about his meal and asking for his money back. This should have thwarted me but I ended up paying 30 dollars for this crappy food.   We order the sweet and sour chicken. The sauce has a strange flavor, unlike the traditional red sauce, this was orange and bland. Almost like jello. We also ordered the egg drop soup, which was very thick and had an odd taste to it, seemed old. And also ordered the crab puffs which were bland, room temp, and just tasteless.   Way too expensive, I paid 30 bucks for food we ended up just throwing away.   Do not recommend for those who love a good Chinese spot.

Lashes for days. And 3 bucks a pair. I use the cherry lashes or whatever kind they sell there and use them for my freelance makeup work. There are even some great MAC dupes. I'm determined to find somewhere even cheaper and I'm sure that place resides far into the hood.

These must be the most miserable employees at any Starbucks I've ever been to. Not friendly at all. Customer service? Seriously lacking. So why do I come here? Desperation or if I didn't have time to make it to a Starbucks before work. And the coffee is good. At least they get that right.

These guys here aren't friendly. Customer service is truly lacking. They also tried to up sell me, which is to be expected but weren't upfront with the cost of things. I got an oil change and a tire rotation, out the door, $55 bucks. Aren't tire rotations supposed to be free?   When I went to pick up my car there was a girl next to me arguing with one of the technicians saying that they caused more damage to her car than when she first brought it in and was visibly upset and demanding a refund.   Will not be returning.  Beware of this place.

I've been coming to this venue for years. I've seen it go through numerous changes and I have to say, it seems to have Improved over the years.   I think they finally have sufficient AC running through this place. It used to be you'd almost die in the audience because it was so hot. They had giant fans to cool the place but they didn't do the job. Glad they finally fixed that issue.   Couple of complaints with this place; bartenders are not friendly. I'm talking about the bartenders in front house upon entrance. Mostly talking the female bartenders I encountered.   Also, their security staff is verbally abusive and downright misogynstic. I was called an asshole by one of the men in the security staff who was short, bald, and white. Sort of looks like he just got out of prison. I plan to call and complain. He also said some other choice words that I don't wish to share, all because we were having fun and waiting for a band to exit so we could meet them. Apparently they get very annoyed when you do this.   2 stars because I've been to some great shows here. Obviously they could use some work on their staff though.

Here's my problem with this club; they seem to have an incompetent group of teenagers running this place. The girls at will call seem very confused. The staff inside is aloof.   I went there with a group of friends to see Chris Delia. 4 tickets and only 3 of us were there as we were waiting on the 4th to arrive. The girl at the door told us we would have to wait for our 4th person to show up for our entire party to be seated. Then she proceeded to make jokes that were completely lost on us. She giggled and cackled the whole time, almost seeming as though she was directly making fun of our situation, which we didn't find funny since we arrived early for good seats. We waited for a couple minutes and were greeted by a server who showed us to our table, even though our 4th was still not there, she informed us it was fine and we could wait inside at our table for her. Which was cool. I don't understand why that's such a big deal anyway.   The servers there deserve to be paid more. They hustle and are very friendly and efficient.   This club needs to find a new staff to handle the tickets. One of my least favorite comedy clubs for this reason.   Once the Laugh Factory opens in Scottsdale, I'll take my business there. Hopefully they'll employ people who actually know what they're doing.

This is a Tempe staple. My favorite bar out this way.   The drinks and strong and cheap, the staff is very attentive and quick, and the food is yummy!   I always get the chicken strips with buffalo sauce. The best I've ever had. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   Love this place.

Being a huge fan of bar food in general, this place hit all the notes for me. The food was great and reminded me of food you'd find at a good old southern barbecue. Simple yet satisfying.   The chicken was amazing! Apparently they're well known for it.   If you're in cave creek, it's definitely worth a trip.

Lux addict here. I love this place. Great for dates or just hanging out with friends. I come here for specialty cocktails made by my friends. Just tell them any alcohol you prefer, sweet or savory, and fruit and they'll make you a delicious drink.   Also, they have the best Mac and cheese in Phoenix. Highly recommended.   I also love how they use in house artists to design their postcards (that come with your check.) They're great art pieces and I've been collecting them for some time.   Love this spot.

I always have a good time when I'm here. Drinks are great. Fun atmosphere.   Chicken phyllo packets are my favorite. I'm not entirely sure what they are comprised of but they're delicious so whatever. Also, the sammies are yum. I got the pear pizza recently and that ruled.   Try those items. I don't think you can go Wrong with anything on the menu. I give it 4 stars though because the staff is super flirty and they're not straight and it makes me sad.

One of my favorite spots downtown. Everything is tasty. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   But a must try is the spinach avocado dip. It's so delicious. I recommend getting it with pita bread instead of ciabatta. Ciabatta is too hard.   Great spot for happy hour!

The Compass Grill; don't get me wrong, this place has an incredible view and a cute cozy date night vibe. However, the food is sub par and the service is comparable.   The last time I went out server was impatient and rude. It seemed like she wanted to get us out as soon as possible to fill the table again. She rushed us in ordering, coming to our table five different times to ask us if we were ready to order, while we were enjoying the view and our bottle of wine.   The food isn't great. Overpriced and just not with it. I had the roasted chicken and it was tasteless and boring.   Probably won't be coming back. This place is a one time stop; go for the view but save your money.

Omg I love this place!   I got a Bloody Mary that comes with a beer chaser. Such a good combo. For lunch I got the spiced burger and fries. Their portions are huge, served on huge plates. Definitely could share if needed. The burger was super tasty. My friend ordered the enchiladas and those were incredible.   I'm convinced anything on the menu is a hit.   New favorite place.

I was looking for a Thai place close to me and was pleasantly surprised that Thai Basil is literally within walking distance. I ordered the pad Thai and spring rolls to go. The sauce they give you for your salad is so good (comes with the spring rolls.) I loved everything. The pad Thai could have used a little more sauce but overall this place is fantastic. Won't be my last time here.

This has to be one of my favorite sushi joints. Mido, why are you so far from me?   They do all day happy hour and all you can eat sushi. Their sushi is fresh and delicious.   The Philly, Vegas, Mexican, spicy tuna, unagi rolls are the best. And miso, salad, and edamame comes with your sushi at no extra cost.   Now I'm craving sushi!! I love you Mido!

The service is seriously lacking. Also there's a female bartender there that enjoys ignoring other females. Other than that, cheap specials. Fundido is good.

Everytime I eat here, either something is wrong with my order or it is ill prepared.   First time here I ordered the bruschetta plate as my appetizer and the steak pesto pasta as my main course. The bruschetta came first and was overdone and the bread was burnt on the bottom making it completely unedible. I sent it back and ordered a new plate. Then came my pesto pasta, which was sub par as the steak was very chewy. After finishing my meal, my new plate of bruschetta came out. It was done correctly but at that point, the appetizer boat had sailed. Once the check came, it was still on my bill. I had them take it off.   Second time I came here, I ordered the chicken fettuccini. Once it came to the table, it was without chicken and the sauce was so watery it couldn't even be described as sauce. More like a soup. I sent it back and got a new dish. The manager sort of watched the situation from afar but never came to address it.  Poor customer service.   Overall, I will not be returning to this location. The management is poor, and you could get better Italian food at an Olive Garden! Or I could have a homeless man come in off the street and boil pasta better than those people. This location sucks! Sorry.

This is my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix.  A bit expensive but they have the yummiest sushi. I love the interior and the overall vibe in the place. Definitely try the dragon roll. It's was my favorite, along with the spicy Hanna. Had me like "daaaaamn." I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 cause they have the weirdest hours and it's hard to catch them when they're open.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Every time I go here my nails don't last longer than a week. I've had two break off and I just had them done. The nail techs make my nails too thin and it's always half assed. So frustrating because I've been going to them for a few months and their quality of work has just gone down hill. Won't be back again.

Everything on the menu is delicious. My favorites include the MAC and cheese, of course, the chicken noodle soup is amazing. Country vegetable chop is my favorite salad. Their soup and salad combo is a good move. Mahi salad. I could go on.   One of my favorite spots uptown. Check it out!

I'm giving this place 5 stars and I'll tell you why...  Came here for a wash, whilst in the wash the machine broke my mirror off!! Royally pissed (but also found it hilarious?) I approached an employee who retrieved my mirror. However, the wash ripped some wiring out along with my mirror.   Long story short, the manager got in contact with me and fixed my car. Even went as far to take a fuse out of his own truck to fix my issue, all within a timely manner.   These dudes rule. I'd just be careful of how violent that car wash can be. Kind of terrifying. But if you're into that kinda thing...   The customer service was so great, I'll be back... But a little more careful next time.

As someone who has had to shop Around for places to receive a safe and comfortable wax, Urban Wax was a god send. Nicole is amazing. Super informative, professional, and made me feel totally comfortable. She is efficient, thorough, and quick! I went in expecting to pay full price for a bikini wax but was pleasantly surprised when I received half off for being a new customer! I also got to pick out a cute pair of panties after my wax and was informed that with each visit I receive free panties!! Woohoo!   The location is perfect, and the design and overall atmosphere of the shop is immaculate, modern, spacious, and beautiful!   Glad to have finally found a home for my waxing needs. See Nicole and you will be so happy you did!!

I really wanted to like this place, I did. But their food was nothing to write home about.   I started with the pretzel ball appetizer. The pretzels themselves were delicious. However, the "nacho cheese" it came with tasted awful and grainy and the second dipping sauce was horse radish. That's it.   I ordered the old fashioned burger with all the fixings. It just didn't blow me away. I feel like I've had better home made burgers. The fries were over done and I got mostly crumbs.   I'd say the plus side to this place is the beer flights and their beer selection. Can't say I'd be back for the food.

This place is insaaaaane on weekends. Jesus. Either make a reservation or show up at a decent hour if you'd like to sit down at some point.   Its a little more on the expensive side. Don't expect a cheap night here.   I ordered the pretzels and fondue for the table and that was well worth it. Almost too much for a party of 6. Skip out on the artichoke hearts.   Overall, this place is entirely packed to the brim with people on the weekends; it gets unbearable at times. But it's a good spot if you're looking for madness to jump start your night.   Our service was fast, efficient, and friendly. One of our dishes got sent to another table at which point the manager comped a meal and gave us a free round of drinks.   Parking is a B. I had to park at Armstrong McCalls.   Come prepared, everyone. It's a party.

Hands down, best pedicure ever. The lady was at it for almost an hour, just massaging and scrubbing and using hot stones. Efficient work and super relaxing. My dogs were barking. Definitely gonna make this my regular pedi stop. And 30 bucks ain't bad to be pampered like that. Feet so clean you could eat off 'em.

I finally got to try this place and wow, SO GOOD.   The hours are a bit unconventional but I was able to catch them while they were open.   I got the pesto florentine on a spinach and cheese bagel. Delicious. Comes with egg, spinach, mushrooms and pesto. Everything was super fresh.  I'm going to try a new bagel every time I come back to this place. I'm sure I won't be disappointed.

I eat at Gallo Blanco regularly and recently tried Otro.   Customer service was impeccable and the food was incredible, as usual.   The guac and chips here are different than Gallo. The guac is more spicy. I actually prefer it over Gallo.   Excellent burritos and enchiladas. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. And I love that they get their in house coffee from Lux.   The owner, Doug, is an awesome guy and made for a pleasant experience when we went.   Definitely a staple!

This spot is so adorable. I've lived downtown for a couple years now and have never even heard of this place but glad I stopped in.   Great vegan food. Best pancakes. The curry waffles are yummy and a must try.   And they have cold brew! Bless their hearts.   A Phoenix hidden treasure.

Best urgent care I've ever been to. Their staff is knowledgable, warm, and welcoming. Very efficient in their diagnosis and were able to get me in to a diagnostics center same day for CT scans. They took really good care of me and for that I am so grateful. Will definitely be back if needed and would recommend this place to anyone in need.

I have to update my review after my last two experiences at this clinic..   First off, I no longer feel welcome at this facility. The girls at the front desk aren't particularly nice and friendly. They seem more concerned with getting payment from you more than anything else.   The doctor that I saw the last two times I've been to this facility doesn't seem to know what she's doing. The first time I was sent home with no real medical advice and no prescription for my ailment.   Now the second time, I was misdiagnosed. I was given a medication that I had an adverse reaction to and ended up having to go to the emergency room. I was told I'd receive a call from them with my test results and have not received a call.   Please do yourself a favor and skip this place. More and more these random Urgent Care centers end up just being a money making scheme and you end up self diagnosing. Definitely will not be back.

5 stars. This place is delicious. Incredible food, yummy drinks and low key atmosphere.   I'd recommend the bruschetta to start. The beef tenderloin mixed with the truffle oil and asparagus is so yummy.   I had the Italian wedding soup and it was incredibly tasty. The meatballs were full of flavor!   Can't wait to go back and try the handmade pastas.

5 stars. This place is super yummy.  To start, we had the chips and guac with pineapple. A really good combination. Super fresh.   I got the pork adovado taco and a coffee braised beef taco. Incredible. I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   Also ordered the sangria and it was a bit strong but really refreshing.   Love this place. The decor is awesome and low key vibe. Highly recommend.

One of the better chais I've had. The staff is friendly and quick. I was in and out in under 10 minutes. 4 stars because I believe in a drive thru Starbucks. I could see struggling to find parking here on the daily.

Best pedicure I've had in awhile. I love that they have a menu with options so you can actually see what you're paying for.

My coffee spot. Everyone's super nice and I love my dirty chais. The drive thru is pretty quick as well. Sometimes I just like to go in and sit and wait for my coffee. Relaxing and I dig the inside layout. Yay!

Worst drive thru ever. If you're in a time crunch, do not stop here. Their workers are slow and not friendly. I think they hire mostly high school kids.

Great spot if you're into threading. There's an older lady there that I typically go to. She's the best.

I was shopping at the Biltmore when I spotted this place. I love the fact they have a pickup window. I ordered the 2 for $6 deal on the street tacos; one chicken, one carnitas. Wow. Soooo good, bursting with flavor. I couldn't decide which taco I loved more. I'm a sucker for a good street taco and they delivered. I'll be tempted to stop here every time I hit the Biltmore. Super yummy.

I like this Starbucks. The drive thru is always lightning fast. The staff is efficient and friendly. And the location itself is pretty big for a Starbucks. I'm glad they opened a location close to work for me.

I really dig the aesthetic of this place. Sort of pseudo euro contemporary decor. Lots of alcohol to choose from. Mostly polish, so lots of vodkas. They have their perogis on happy hour, which I definitely advise getting. You get to try four different types of perogis and they're all delicious. Made me curious to try more. I'll be back for sure!

Insanely awesome decor and aesthetic. Awesome and friendly staff. Not to mention their security is top notch. I had a great time here with friends, playing board games, pool, and enjoying modestly priced cocktails. Good music too. I'll definitely be back.
