I called the information phone number and the chick told me I can go early and check out the zoo before the zoo lights and didn't warn me that the zoo lights doesn't open til 5:30 so I've been waiting here since 4:00pm I don't live close to here so I'm stuck waiting til 5:30 pm and I'm very disappointed

Doesn't even deserve a star i paid for the best car wash service and when my car was done the rims looked as if they didn't even bother to wipe them down and clean them oh and don't buy anything from their store unless you are positive you want it because they have a no return policy I'm definitely not going here again I don't care if it's close to my house
