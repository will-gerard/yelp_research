Great place to see a play.  small venue with no bad set.  Great plays.  it is your secret place for good theater in the middle of the city.  Other Desert Cities was one of my favorites.

Took me too many years to get here and want to return.  Tried out their wine bar. Great Zinfandel. Then a pizza which was delicious.  Next time dinner

Dr. Loeschen and his staff at Elliot Park Animal Hospital are the best. I have been going there for over 12 years.  Dr. L. is kind, patient, knowledgeable and the staff is welcoming.  They have taken care of my pets from when they were little to when they passed. My cat almost died of a urinary tract situation.  I believe he would not have lived if she was somewhere else.  They took care of him for days, nursing him back to health.  They even took a photo of my cat and the two aides together while he was there.  When it was time to say good-bye to my wonderful dog.  Dr. L and the staff made the room peaceful and was there right with you.  He watched this dog grow from a puppy and you could tell he was touched too.  They sent a lovely card with her footprint afterwards and did the same with our other pets who have passed.  I have been going to Elliot Park since before it was VCA and have had wonderful experiences. Thank you Dr. Loechen and staff for being there for me.  Keep up the good work.

My new favorite place. Went there the first time this past week.  Won't be my last time.  There is a wide selection of margaritas and the wine was delicious.  big portion of food and it was delicious. The best part - sitting on the patio listening to live music and watching the fire pit!  This is the place to go whether on date night, a work night or whenever!    Camelback Inn is a beautiful resort.

This place is great.  I walked in and there were a variety of appliances.  Within five minutes bought a whirlpool.    Everyone is so helpful and friendly.

I have used Kwik as a Wink plumbing on several occasions.  They are quick to respond and do a great job.  They even tell you tips to make things easier.

The place opened a few months ago and they are still building.  The outdoor area is open and it's wonderful to sit outside at the lake and have your drink and meal.  The Captain's room will be a wonderful place to sit when it is too hot outside.  plan to go here again.

Remind me to not go here again.   Only thing going for this place is the view.  Food was tasteless

So glad this restaurant is near my house.    The étouffée is delicious.   The live music is right out of New Orleans.    I'd go here once a week if I could.

went for the first time a couple of weeks after the gilbert location opened.  I know everyone talks about the fried chicken and waffles - I'm not much of a fan of either.  however, put a shrimp and grits on the menu and I am ordering that!  Lo-Lo's shrimp and grits is a little different with some bacon and delicious. Next time you are there you have to try!
