I really do enjoy this place. It's close to my work and in the middle of downtown Phoenix.  The staff is very friendly and the service is quite fast.  This past visit though didn't leave me as happy as I normally would be.  I've ordered their burgers and fries before, which I really enjoyed and especially for the price.  Today, I opted for hot dogs with a side of potato salad.  That sounded good to me so that is what I ordered but sadly, all I got were 2 incredibly dinky hot dogs.  For $2.75 each, I was not too pleased.  Even if if had included any toppings, the dog itself was a very small/thin dog.  Had it been a thin snappy dog, (dirty water dog) I could see past it but it wasn't.  The potato salad though was very good   I think I will stick to the burgers from now on.

The food is too overpriced for what you get. I've never been to a bar/restaurant that let me down so much with their chicken strips. I mean really, how do you mess that up?? They weren't strips at all but more like nuggets and way over cooked. For $8.50, it was incredibly disappointing.  I observed other dishes my friends ordered and their food wasn't appealing either. I think I'll stick to drinks only from now on.

Loooooooooooooove it.  This charming place in the heart of downtown Phoenix is a great spot whether you're by yourself, with friends, or even on a little romantic date night.  From the appetizers to the drinks, entrees and music there really isn't a bad item. (at least not one I have experienced)  The Feta Rose is one of my favorite items on the menu! Feta happens to be one of my favorite cheeses and sometimes it can be a little over-powereing but their blend of feta, roasted red pepper and garlic is perfection!  And if you need a little pick-me-up but don't want to rely solely on hard liquor or soda, I HIGHLY recommend the Wide Eyed Pumpkin.  This has to be one of the most delicious iced coffee drinks I've ever had.  If I remember correctly, it is made with espresso, Rumchatta, and Pumpkin Pie vodka. (Or something similar to it, anyway) I ordered 2 of them the first time I tried it and I will ALWAYS go back for another.  They also have a great happy hour with half off appetizers (which includes the Feta Rose!) and $3.50 Wells from 4pm - 7pm.  I'm already looking forward to the next time I'm able to stop in. Great place!

I've ordered here before with coworkers and usually, it's pretty decent for the price. (the lunch special)  I ordered teriyaki chicken and when my coworker came back with my food, I honestly didn't even want to eat it. The chicken just looked off and not what I have always been familiar with when it comes to teriyaki chicken. I ate a few bites though because my stomach was growling and after that, I decided to not even touch the chicken and I just ate the rice and eggroll.  The texture was incredibly rubbery and I am hoping at this point, it was actually chicken that I ate.  It just did not taste or look right at all...

This place has drastrically gone down hill over the past few months. The service is CRAP and I had been somewhat of a regular and when I stopped in last night for what I expected during the usual happy hour, the "bartender" told us all they had on special was their house margarita for $7. I looked at her and said, "um...what? the house used to always be $5 no matter what and happy hour had all other maragaritas half off and $2 wells...so now, nothing?"   Either she had no clue about her the specials at her own damn bar or they really dropped the ball on their happy hour since that was the only reason people went.  NO THANKS  Twice now, we have walked in and immediately left to go to Bar Louie. From now on, I'll skip San Felipes all together.

I've been here numerous times and each time, I remember why I love it so much! I will say, I am solely speaking of my HH experiences as I have not been for their dinner service.    I have yet to find another HH anywhere in AZ with specials like they offer, as well as the quality of food and drinks on their HH.  The infused sake bottles are DANGEROUS and when I say that, it is because they are ridiculously cheap and tasty. Their specialty drinks are also delicious, especially the Pikachu. (I have yet to try every specialty drink but I am sure it will happen eventually)  And if you're addicted to edamame as I am, you can't beat a decent sized serving for $2 during happy hour. Not to mention the Go Go Fried Rice has always been amazing! (and the amount of food for $5 is ridiculous, in a good way) My favorite sushi will always be their Dragon Rolls which have always left me satisfied.  I've read previous reviews about the poor service and I have never experienced that myself here. (but again, I have only gone for HH and have always been able to seat myself at the bar)  If you only have a party of 2, perhaps sit at the bar or patio. Sure, it's hot in AZ but with their misters on and a nice cold beverage, it's not half bad.  The music has always been top notch as well. I am a fan and will continue to spread the word on the great Geisha a Go Go!

Delicious!   Came here last night with friends for Happy hour and we very pleased. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very open and comfortable and we were seated in a nice booth lined with pillows.  Our server, Eric, was incredibly knowledgeable and provided excellent service.  I opted for the red sangria to start and it came garnished with oranges.  It was a bit more tart than other sangrias I have had so if you're looking for a sweet sangria, our waiter recommended the white.  We ordered the Sicily pizza and I was definitely not disappointed.  The crust was absolutely perfect!  Very light and slightly crispy but not too thin.  The goat cheese combined with the sausage, shallots and sun dried tomatoes were a treat for the tastebuds and my tummy!  Very good flavor and just enough to share between 2  to 3 people.   I normally don't order dessert but when I saw they had Tirimisu (which is my favorite), I had to try it.  I wish I had snapped a photo because even the presentation of the dessert was amazing.   I was not disappointed at all after the first bite.  It was light, fluffy, and the had the perfect amount of coffee flavor and custard.  Delicious!   I was very pleased and will be back again and again!

Tried it for my first time today and all I can say is YUM!  Had the Italian 12" which is easily large enough to share with someone. I added sweet peppers and mayo and it was delicious!!! 100% fresh meat, veggies and the bread was perfect.  I am definitely a fan and will even say it was the best Italian sub I've ever had.

This is a perfect coffee spot in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Every time I walk in, I'm greeted with a smiling face behind the counter.  The music is always at the perfect volume and a great selection as well.    I always enjoy looking at the artwork on the walls while waiting for my order, which never takes long.  I've read other reviews where they said the wait time was an issue but I suppose I just happen to get lucky.   The butter beer is just all around DELICIOUS!  Definitely a treat for the tastebuds.  I also recently needed quite a pick me up, so I ordered a large iced vanilla latte with an extra shot of espresso. (not knowing a large already included 3) The adorable gal behind the counter let me know right away that I was going to be having 4 shots of espresso if I included the extra shot. I still kept the order the same, as I had to be out for a while after the work day was done. While she was making it, she asked if I wanted to add ANOTHER, on the house.  How could I decline? :)    I love how informative and friendly the staff is and they always want to make sure your order is correct and meets your expectations.  I have never had any bad experiences here and will continue to make this my downtown coffee shop.

I really enjoy this place! I have been a few times and I am always greeted as soon as I walk in the door and receive great service from there.  I typically sit at the bar since I am usually with only one other guest for a bite and a drink and we always enjoy trying new drinks and hearing their specialties.  A few times, the manager (or maybe even owner?) has come out to to visit and ask how our experience is going.  I feel they truly care about their service and quality of food, which sadly is rare these days.  The chicken curry is ALWAYS amazing, as well as the #28, Com Bo Luc Luc (which was recommended to my friend by the manager/owner)  Never disappointed! Give it a chance and I am sure you will be back!

when this location opened,  I was pretty pleased to have it so close to home.  The first couple of visits were decent.  Fast service and always seemed on top of refilling our drinks. (even before we were finished)   Their selection is really not all that great.  Their lo mein is very very bland and I recommended adding a lot of soy sauce for any type of flavor.  Their baked salmon is questionable and is usually over cooked.  I think it has a dill sauce over it which was not very good.    I mainly stick to their sauteed mushrooms and spicy chicken.  Some of their other dishes like the teriyaki chicken and most of their beef dishes are a bit greasy and sadly, that is all you taste...grease.   I'm done with this place and am looking for another Chinese buffet close to home that is at least somewhat satisfying.  Oh and almost $11 for lunch on the weekend is a joke.

I came here because Cost Cutters was closed and I left a bit disappointed.   My cut was fine,  I just went in for a trim but since I was going out after I asked the stylist if she could just blow dry my hair. (Not style, blow dry)  She blow dried it, barely put a spritz of hairspray in and we were done. A haircut costs $12...needless to say, I was a bit shocked when I was charged $31.00. I looked at the board and noticed for a "regular style" was $18.  1. I  don't understand how a style costs more than a cut, 2. I was shocked I was charged their full price of a style when all I asked for (and got done) was a simple blow dry.  When I asked for a blow dry, she should have made it known it would cost me an additional $18.  I was pretty upset when I walked out and because of that, I won't be back.  I have NEVER paid near that for a blow dry.  $5, maybe. $18?! I don't think so!

The only car wash I will go to.  Extremely friendly service every time. They are fast,  efficient,  and cheap.  You can't go wrong here with a $3 car wash.

I am writing this review based on what just occured between my co-worker and the supposed manager of this restaurant. My coworker ordered pho (take out) and when she opened the container and sifted through the pho, there was a bug. To ANYONE this has happened to (or even if it hasn't) this is incredibly disgusting to discover in your food.  She called to let them know what happend and was going to come back to get her money, when the "manager" told her they didn't want her business and it wasn't their problem.  This is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable.  And it gets worse. My co-worker went back with another co-worker to bring the pho back so they could see for themselves and when they walked in, the container cracked/opened and the bag was filled with the pho, to which the manager said/yelled to them, "get that sh*t out of here. I don't want it". He proceeded to argue with my coworkers and raise his voice in the restaurant. (while other customers were present)  THAT is how you run your business? Yelling AND swearing at a female customer in the middle of your restaurant because she brought to your attention your pho was insect ridden!?    GET THE HELL out of here.  DISGUSTING, and I (along with MANY MANY MANY employess that work downtown and used to go to this restaurant), will NEVER be back.  You are TRASH for speaking to a customer this way.   So if in fact the manager was involved with this encounter, I hope your doors soon close. And if this happened to be an employee posing as a manger, then I hope you lose your job and the real manager make drastic changes in the kitchen as well as your hiring process.

I really wanted to to try this place after it was recommended by some friends. We came here last week only to find out that it was closed.  Apparently they are changing locations and judging by most of the comments, I'd say it is a smart move.  I look forward to trying it at their next location.

Went here for the first time this weekend and I will definitely be back!   Very cute and open decor with a large friendly staff.  There was a little bit of a wait when we arrived but it was worth it!   From there signature drinks to take on brunch, I think this place is definitely sticking around.  I had just an original mimosa w/oj but they offer many other juices to mix.  For my entree, I opted for the Snooze Spuds Deluxe: A heaping portion of our hash browns, covered with melted cheddar & jack cheese, scallions plus two veggies , meats, or combo of your choice. (taken directly from their menu) So good and our service was fantastic.   I would eat here every morning if I could!

I definitely won't be back. Came here on my birthday for a drink and sat at a table.  They had the doors open that lead to the patio which is ok however, when people outside are smoking cigars which is carrying into the restaurant can be quite disgusting.   I ordered an incredibly simple drink which I would think is learned in bartending 101 (Hell, I knew this drink when I was a teenager), a 7 & 7.  The waitress went to the bar to put in our drinks and came back to ask, "what's in a 7 & 7?"   Wow. I gave her a blank look and said,  "whiskey and 7up or sprite works too."  At that point I had extremely low expectations and sure enough,  when my drink came it was pretty awful and for only having 2 parts to the drink, you'd think it's not too difficult.  Apparently if you're not ordering a beer or vodka redbull, these "bartenders" won't have a clue.  I guess that's what you get at a bar on Mill these days.

I have lived in Mesa most of my life here in Arizona, and I remember this location when it used to be TGIFriday's. (when they were decent)  I typically do not drive on Longmore Rd. unless stopping at Fiesta Mall for something, which is rare these days; however, I did recently drive by and noticed O'Brien's "Yes! We're Open!" sign.  I thought, "oh wow! After all these years, it's finally occupied again."    I decided to try it out this past Sunday since I read on their site they showed "All of the games".  We got there right as they opened or maybe a few minutes just past, and I was impressed with the decor. I loved that they kept the bar separate from the restaurant and was right in your view as you walked in. Definitely inviting, and the color scheme is very warm with rich browns and dark wood.    And when they said "All of the games", they weren't kidding! 16 tvs (I believe is what I counted), in the bar area and they did in fact have all of the football games along with basketball, hockey, golf, and even bowling.  Definitely, something for every sports fan.  We were greeted by two bartenders, one who had been there since they opened in September and the other was her first day. Both were incredibly friendly and I have to give props to the "veteran" bartender who informed me after I ordered a bloody mary that their mix was very spicey and she can make it less spicey for me if I like. I really appreciate a bartender who gives details like that and it was an A-MAZING bloody mary. To my surprise, it came with a slim jim. Who would've thought it would be good!? Well, it was and after I told a few friends about it, they made their way to join me in about an hour.  (And they too ordered a bloody mary)  There wasn't much of a crowd but then again, it was late morning on a Sunday and most of the "good" games weren't showing until 2:30pm, so I wasn't too surprised. But by 1pm, the bar was definitely filling up and while the bartenders may have been frazzled by the sudden increase in patrons, it never took the smile off their face.  It was clear they were understaffed but those that were available definitely gave it their best service.  We ordered the fried pickles and McNachos and I was incredibly impressed with the portions for both.  A nice helping of fried pickles definitely made me happy and the batter was nice and light and had a bit of flakeyness to it which was perfect. The McNachos were HUGE and very tasty. I also liked that they put the toppings off to the side, which made it easier to dip/dunk instead of having a plate of soggy nachos.  I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu, for sure.  They also did have drink specials which I learned once I asked, but they weren't listed anywhere.  With some more advertising, stable wait staff, and a few tuneups here and there, this place can definitely be the new "it spot" for us in the area. I will definitely be back and plan to bring others with me. I would love to see this place stick around!

Drinks are weak and not made correctly.  I guess that's what you get with a barely legal bartender.   Don't even bother ordering chicken strips unless you like paying $10 for 4 misshapen nuggets that are half burned.   Definitely won't be back.

Great new spot on the Eastside,  finally!   A nice selection of craft beer that's reasonably priced,  great food to munch on and knowledgeable staff.  Definitely a place you will want to come back to!
