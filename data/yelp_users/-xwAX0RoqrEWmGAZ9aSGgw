This place is bomb!   I often come to this Sprouts for lunch because they have $2.99 sandwiches, that will rock your socks off! OK, I mean that metaphorically not literally, calm down. Their sandwiches are always loaded up with the good stuff and they have so many topping choices! I always get turkey on multigrain with mayo, mustard, red onion, tomato, lettuce and sprouts. YUM! They have a glorious selection of trail mixes that you pay for by the pound so you can load up for the week or just for an afternoon snack, nuts anyone?   They have really great prices, so you can't go wrong. I would do all of my grocery shopping here if there was one closer to my house. Having said that, this review is based on my lunch break visits.

Ahh, nothing beats the scent of body odor, cigarette smoke, and beer on a beautiful Sunday afternoon at Walmart. Hey, we can get these free smells at almost any Walmart.   Once you have been to one Walmart you have been to them all. Cheap prices and everything you could ever want to purchase all in one place! Rock on!   Having said that, this Walmart's layout is pretty bad. Everything is scattered around the store, and it is so hard to find what your looking for. I think they want you to wander around aimlessly with no sense of direction. Of coarse the only people who actually work at Walmart are the cashiers, so good luck finding someone to point you in the direction of the hand soap section.   Sadly, there are other Walmart locations that are better. (Did I just say that?)

I don't understand why everyone likes this place so much. This place is called burrito express and we had to wait like 20 minutes to get our food, with no one in front of us. I got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito. His was like 3 times the sizes of mine and my cheese wasn't even melted. My burrito wasn't terrible but it wasn't good. My fiance's burrito was so disgustingly greasy he couldn't even finish it and he loves greasy food, we wouldn't even want to give it to our dog. It looked disgusting! He just threw the other half away and felt sick the rest of the day. We ordered some chips and salsa and they threw a couple table spooned size salsa containers in the bag, which wasn't enough for the chips. We asked for more and they charged us extra for each salsa! The salsa tasted terrible! They also charge you extra for using a credit card. I wouldn't go back.

Out of 5 stars..I would give this place a -12. We passed by an old country buffet today and were talking about how we used to go there when we were little. We looked up online and saw hometown buffet was the same according to the website. So we gave it a shot.  Horrible mistake. We got there at 7:20 and the lady at the counter said "you know, we close at 8", we asked if it was too late to be seated, she said no so we sat. We started looking around at the food. Everything looked like it came straight out of a can. There was a carving station with no knife that looked as if it had been sitting there for days, hospital looking green beans, mashed potatoes, corn,carrots, and some other mystery items (honestly we had a long discussion about what they could be and nothing had a sign). I grabbed a couple things and some chicken nuggets. Everything tasted disgusting except the chicken nuggets(it was clear they were previously frozen). I decided to go back to get some salad, I figured that was safe at least. It was 7:30 and they had already pulled all the salad items to put away. I managed to grab some lettuce before they took it to the kitchen. The lettuce was sitting in water and when I got back to the table noticed most of it was brown (ate some). I figured I would grab some chocolate lava cake quickly before they pulled that too. It was horrible. It tasted like a cardboard flavored sponge, my fiance said it tasted like..a$$.  Now, here's the best part... I walk into the bathroom. All the stalls look like they had been kicked in, out of the 4, 2 were out of order and locked from the inside. 1 of the 2 open ones was clogged and someone left a very nice number 2 for all to see, I went into my last option...THERE WAS FREAKING BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE!!! It seriously looked like a crime scene. It was all over the toilet, smeared on the stall walls, and all over the floor. I was horrified! I obviously didn't use the restroom and didn't know if I should go home and shower or attempt to wash my hands. 2 of the 3 sinks we're broken, literally missing parts, and one hand dryers was hanging off the wall, the other had already fallen to the floor.  How DARE these owners allow their bathrooms to get to this point, and how is this place still in business? I would NEVER go there again.

Spinatos is delicious. Their big mama spinach pie is so good it's almost wrong. Their red sauce is sweet, like your typical Chicago pies, and it's actually for sale at this location along with their vodka sauce. This location is teeny tiny so I suggest carry out. People are so friendly and super nice. They get crazy busy but never let that get them down. If you've never been here, go. The only reason they lost one star was because their estimated pickup times have been at least a half an hour off, last time an entire hour, which was rather annoying, especially considering there's no room to stand and wait

I really like Bison Witches! They have $1 jello shots and amazing sandwitches! Their sandwitches are HUGE and their soups are good also. They have a full bar and a cool atmosphere. If you are on mill, I would definately suggest stopping in for a drink and sandwitch.

I love cafe istanbul! They have a really good variety of sheesha and everything you need for your at home hookah needs. The guy who works in the hookah store is really nice and is very knowledgeable about hookah. He is very generous as well.   Their food is really good also. There isn't an extensive list of choices but their schwarmas are awesome. I personally like the chicken and for about 6 bucks for a good sized schwarma and fries you can't go wrong.  Their hookah lounge is upstairs and you enter from the parking lot. They have good choices and are also very nice. They were doing deals that women got free hookah on tuesdays (not sure if this is still going on). All you have to do is bring a girl with youand on a tuesday and bam! Let the awesome deals begin!

This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered.  Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time.   Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My "hot sub" is ice cold, there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again.  This place probably has a "good taste potential". Unfortunately, like most "hot food" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DON'T GET DELIVERY!

This is a really nice target, very clean, very friendly employees. They really do their best to keep their line wait times down which is really nice. Nothing's worse than waiting in line for 74 hours trying to purchase a few items. They have a starbucks, clothing section,  electronics, school supplies, small grocery section,  large variety of cards, school/office supplies, basically everything you can think of. They're in tempe marketplace so parking not a problem. One thing I will recommend is if you're planning to go there and will be using a cart to get your stuff back to your car MAKE SURE YOU PARK IN THEIR PARKING LOT. The carts have wheel locks once you leave their area. I once parked in the bust buy parking lot which was next door and walked to target after, on the way back to my car the wheels locked up right in the middle of one of the parking isles Lol. Once the wheels lock you have to have incredible hulk strength to move it all. Just an FYI.  :)

Benihana is the best place ever.  Keep in mind this is the kind of place that is not cheap, however there are more affordable choices if you look for them.   This location is pretty good however the waitresses are slow to refill drinks. You sometimes have to ask for refills because the waitresses are off talking to each other. Also I would suggest making reservations when you go. It is hit and miss crowded. Sometimes you go on a random Tuesday night and it's a 2 hour wait sometimes you can just walk in and sit down. If you make a reservation you aren't always seated right away, you typically have to wait at least 10 minutes, which is better than 2 hours.   The food is excellent, I recommend the seafood diablo dish and its only about 20 bucks! Its has scallops, shrimp,calamari, veggies and noodles. It is a little spicy but you can ask for them to not put on the sauce that makes it spicy.   Our chef was Scott and he happened to be the head chef. He was amazing and hilarious, unlike any chef we have had before.   To top it off, if you sign up on their website you get $30 to spend there on anything! AWESOME!

We were craving po boys and found this place online. We were both on our computers looking at the menu and realized they have a few different websites that each have different menus. Everything sounded so good! We saw that they do carry out so placed an order for 2 popcorn shrimp po boys, with 2 sides of ranch (for the fries duh) and an order of calamari, 10 minutes. Cool! My better half went to pick up the food and when he came back it smelled really good.   I opened the calamari and saw that they forgot to put the sauce to dip the calamari in, not good. The two ranches were in there instead (they charge 50 cents extra per ranch, not good).  The calamari itself was not very good, it was kind of plain it may have been better if the dipping sauce was good (if they could remember to put it in).  I opened my shrimp po boy. The fries were pretty good I think they were actually the best tasting part of the entire meal. The sandwitch itself was pre-cut in half, I took a bite, then another, all I was tasting was bread, lettuce, onion, tartar sauce, and pickles. I opened up the sandwitch half....two tiny shrimp about the size of nickles....really?! TWO FREAKING SHRIMP!? Come on people! I opened the other half and there were 5 small shrimp, so I put the two from the other half on there. It didn't taste very good. There was too much tartar and it was weird that it had pickles.  I wouldn't get the popcorn shrimp po boy or calamari again from there. I might be willing to give the gumbo or jambalaya a try in the future, maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?

I would like to start out by saying I've been a member of this gym for over 4 years and just recently canceled my membership.   This gym started out terrific! It was always clean, not super crowded and everything was NEW! If something broke it was always fixed in a timely manor. There always used to be cleaning people around wiping down the machines, now there is no one.   Recently, things that break take weeks to get repaired or just are taken away all together without being replaced, leaving awkward gaps. The cubbies in the front never work, and fill up fast leaving you to carry your stuff around, unless you bring your own lock for the mens/womans locker rooms.   One of the worst parts is their air conditioning. I don't know about you but when I go to they gym I don't like to be sweaty before I even start working out. I would go at 5 AM and the temperature would already be pushing 85 degrees. This makes it obnoxious to use in the summer months. I mentioned this to the staff everyday for my last 3 weeks. Some of the staff would say "oh..I'll ask the janitor to look into it." some would say "well the thermostat says 79 here in the front.", I don't even keep my house at 85.   If your a person who likes to work out after work good luck finding parking here or even a machine to use. This place gets PACKED from 4-8pm, which sends the temperature at the gym into the upper 80's. GROSS! You literally have to park in a different parking lot, and have to wait to use an elliptical/treadmill, and your lucky if the machine you get on even works properly. OVERCROWDED TO THE MAX!   The bonus side of this gym: They offer free child care and free classes. I have never used the child care because I don't have children but it's pretty nice that they offer it. I think you can only go during certain hours because whenever I was there I always heard them announcing that the child care was closing. I would double check before going. The classes are free but I never actually went to any because you have to sign up weeks in advance since they fill up quickly.   Overall, I think 24 hour has potential but they need to focus more on client happiness and be less membership sell happy.

Ok..this is a walmart..and yes, I am giving it 4 stars. Compared to other walmarts I have been to I would have to say this location is one of the best. I typically do my grocery shopping here because everything is really..really cheap! (also it is the closest to my house) This walmart is organized pretty well-groceries left, garden right, sports/games back etc. Some other walmarts you have to go on a store adventure just to grocery shop.  The downside..it's walmart, and it does get very crowded. You typically spend at least a half hour extra on miscellaneous activities. What activities you may ask? Dodging the crowds, weaving through random groups of kids and yes, the check out line.

I called to place an order for delivery and was hung up on. After ordering I asked what comes on their club, the man on the phone told me to hold on, then yelled at someone in Spanish for 2 minutes into the receiver. When he came back I again asked what was on the club and he asked "are you going to order, because I have other customers", I said I realize this, all I would like to know is what comes on your club. Then he hung up on me. I called back and it went to voice mail... Shame on them.

Tonight we were pondering where to go to eat and decided to try something new. From the outside it isn't a place we would normally stop at but with the reviews this place got on Yelp we decided to give it a try. We were pleasantly supprised!  This is not set up like a typical buffet where you serve yourself, they bring the food to you. They are only open until 9:00PM and we went around 8:00 PM. There was only one table of 3 people. When we came in we were greeted right away and shown the buffet area. They let us know they didn't have as much as usual because they were closing soon and were not very crowded but made us feel right at home. Everything we had was really amazing, we especially LOVED the ice cream at the end yum.   Just go here..DOOO ITTT.

This place is pretty rockin. They have a gyro combo for $7.50. It comes with a gigantic and fully stacked gyro, a large side of french fries and a drink. Amazing plus...THEY.HAVE.RANCH! Score! This always excites me because a lot of these places serve fries but no ranch...anyway. the place is clean and the servers are nice. I was apparently confused when I was ordering because I almost ordered some plate with a bunch of meat...thankfully they explained what I was ordering before I paid so I could change my order..situation avoided.  Fast, great price, great food!

I started writing a review when they first bought out the previous darque tan but wanted to give it some time for my opinion to ferment, if you will, so have a initial and now review.  INITIAL:lot more expensive than the previous darque tan that was here which isn't validated whatsoever,  everything is exactly the same. I think it's completely ridiculous that they failed to honor my resigning contract from darque tan. I was supposed to receive a $25 surplus for resigning due to the fact that they wouldn't hold my account for over 2 months while I was away. They are a lot more focused on selling retail products in almost an invasive "peer pressure" sort of way, stay strong mighty stingrays! It's annoying that when I come in the level 2 beds that I pay to use are always taken, thus making me wait at least 20 minutes (ain't no one got time for that).  NOW: I am a lot happier with Palm Beach tanning, their employees are friendly and knowledgeable especially Lizzy, she's great, I don't even have to say my name anymore . I'm not sure what happened, if they prices drove people away but it's never crowded anymore.  Their hours are a lot longer which is nice for flexibility. They seem a lot more efficient than the other tanning company and the employees are more professional.

I just ordered from here on some random delivery app I just downloaded because I needed some Thai food in my life ASAP. I am so impressed with this place! Delivery didn't take long maybe 40 minutes, and the delivery man was very nice. We got pad see ew (asked for chicken instead of beef and they got it right!  Yay), pad thai, and Tom yum soup. Everything was literally piping hot I am very impressed. I've gotten dishes at restaurants before that weren't even this hot lol good job guys! We will definitely be ordering from you again very soon! Two thumbs up
