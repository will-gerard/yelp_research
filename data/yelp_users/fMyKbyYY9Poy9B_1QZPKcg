Stopped into this branch on Thursday, Feb 17th. I drive past it all the time on the way to work and have long thought it would be convenient to do business at this location. The hours on the door indicated they were open until 5:30 and I arrived right at 5pm. The branch was empty with the exception of a few employees. I was greeted by one of the tellers. I explained my desire to apply for a loan and was directed to a young man named Anthony.   Anthony could barely muster a friendly attitude. He was visibly annoyed to have to deal with me so close to branch closing hours. Immediately realizing his frustration I apologized for coming in so late and explained that I (like most people) have to work until at least 5pm but was able to get away a few minutes early to take care of some business.  One benefit to his eagerness to be done with me is that he flew through the process. I was literally done by 5:18. At which point his attitude improved significantly.   The very next day I received a follow-up call from the Sunwest Federal Credit Union loan team. They needed some additional information which I was happy to provide. I'm not sure what it is about the folks at this Credit Union but again I got a huge amount of attitude. It was clear she felt bothered to have to deal with me.   Ultimately I decided to take my business elsewhere. There are just too many other banks and credit unions that would appreciate my time and business. I'd recommend that you make a similar decision if good friendly customer service is important to you and your preferred banking experience.

For years I've been using Jim and his team. I'm a really low maintenance client. I carefully keep and organize all of my tax stuff (receipts, forms, etc) and then once a year deliver them to his office. The only time I really ever talk with him or his team is when he calls after completing my taxes to let me know what the outcome is. He's been friendly and and enjoyable to talk with on the few occasions we've talked.  He's done a good job, though I've never had a CPA before so I base that only on the fact that my return is better than when I did it myself using Turbo Tax. I have noticed that my costs for his services have gone up several hundred dollars over the past few years but I understand there's a price to pay for good service so I've never complained about paying $700+ each time.  This year (2011) for the first time in the 4 or 5 year history of using Capital Accounting's services I needed Jim's team to go above and beyond and file my taxes immediately. I sat with him during the first week of February and personally explained that I was at risk of losing my entire return ($8K) if he didnt file so that I received the return prior to the end of the month. I was very detailed in my explanation and he explained that the IRS needed to update some files that would not be available until Feb 14th but that he would file my returns on the very next day (Feb 15th). Since that was the best that could be done, I agreed, thanked him and shared my appreciation.  On Feb 15th (Tues) I called his office to ensure he had everything he needed to file and to verify that it would be done that day. I left a message with a woman who answered the phone. She assured me they had everything and would call immediately if not. I heard nothing from them so I called back on Friday (18th) just to make sure.   To my disappointment, I recieved a call from Jim later that day asking me to remind him why I needed them filed on the 15th. My heart sank. I couldnt believe my ears. He hadn't filed my taxes, they were just going out on the 18th and I wasnt going to receive the return until March. All of it lost. Every single penny of that $8k is lost.   This is no way to treat customers on the ONE occassion when they ask you to do a little more than usual. The cost to use Capital Accounting's services to file my taxes? Over $8K, plus I imagine he'll even submit an invoice for his time. Talk about a disaster.

The Good: The kids loved the Oasis Water Park. We were fortunate to have an overcast day and we played all day on the lazy river, wave pool and water slides. It was a blast.  The Bad: They gouge you on food prices. I couldn't believe we spent $200 on food in a single day and didn't even eat dinner there. We had two corn dogs, nachos (that sucked), chicken fingers and four colas for $65! Breakfast was nearly $60 and the Embassy Suites free breakfast buffet is MUCH better.   The rooms are really dated. The televisions were small old CRTs from the 80s only one generation removed from having a dial on the t.v. to change the channel.   I can't imagine a scenario where I'll return with the family. We could have bought season passes from Wet n' Wild for the same amount we spent at the Arizona Grand for a single day.

I love this place. The red beef chili chimichanga is out of this world extraordinary. The meat is tender and juicy, the sauce is freakin-phenomenal and just writing this review is making my mouth water thinking about how good it is.   My wife loves the chicken quesadilla. Its huge! The kids usually share it with a couple sides of rice. There are items on the kids menu but the girls prefer the quesadilla.  The service is great, always friendly and the food prep is quick.   The whole family recommends this place if you are looking for GREAT Mexican food at very affordable prices. In a region thats known for its Mexican cuisine this place is a true gem.  Edit: Upgraded from 4 stars to 5 stars because I realized the other day that this is my favorite Gilbert restaurant. Its awesome!

This is the most extraordinary theater I've ever been to. I love this place. I've only been in theater 11 so I'm not certain all of the others are the same, but this one has an incredible amount of leg room between the seats. Someone could literally walk down the aisle and not even brush against your legs.   In addition, the clarity of the picture, the sound, the termperature... all perfect! I live down near San Tan mall and drive out of my way to this location to watch movies, thats how awesome it is.

I love my doc (Dr. Patterson). He takes the time to listen, answer questions and discuss treatment options. He's open minded, knowledgeable and makes me feel confident in his recommendations and insights. For that he's worthy of a 5-star rating.  Unfortunately, he's typically 30-45 minutes (or more!) behind in the afternoons which means I have to take off a half day of work because there is no way to make it back to the office. For that, I feel compelled to only leave 4-stars for a doc that in every other way is a 5-star.

The pizza and calzones are great! My kids love the rootbeer club. The prices are affordable. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review is that they recently changed the Italian nachos, which we used to love, and now they suck. Boo!

We arrived on a Saturday morning at about 9:30. At the time it wasn't that busy, the restaurant was about half full and there was only one couple ahead of me at the counter when I ordered. I was there with my family of 4.  The Good  - The restaurant was immaculate. Very clean and modern looking. Its a cool place.  - The staff is very friendly.   The Bad  - So... very.... slow.... I'm not sure if she was new but the lady taking orders at the front counter was PAINFULLY slow. Watching her take the order of the couple of ahead of me was a lesson in patience. When it was my turn to place an order the experience was only slightly better.  Once my order was taken it took more than 10 minutes just to get our Cinnamon Roll.. and it was cold! They didnt even take a moment to throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds.  It took another 15 plus minutes beyond that for us to get our breakfast. By that time it had been more than 25 minutes since I ordered and my kids were bouncing out of their chairs with boredom. Considering how slow it was when we placed our order that is just WAY TOO LONG to wait for food.  The Eh.. The food was alright. If I take into consideration it cost $30 dollars it was a pretty poor experience. But on its own merit, the food was no better than OK. My biscuits and gravy were cold, the pancakes might have been OK but the syrup was terrible.   Frankly, given the standards for great food set by Joe's across the street I expected way better and next time I'll just wait in line for the Farmhouse next door.

It all started with some clear green viscous goop on the floor of my garage. I cleaned it up a few times and it would reappear a few days later. So I decided to run my car down to Sun Devil Auto. They're pretty close to the house and I'm not a fan of taking it to the dealer.  I was promptly greeted and the guy behind the desk took the time to ask me questions and listen to my concerns.   I should probably mention that I had also been meaning to replace my Serpentine belt for a few weeks and had actually bought a belt at Autozone in anticipation of having a buddy put it on for me. Unfortunately that fell through and the belt had been just sitting in my car.   The guy at the desk saved me the hassle of having to return the belt (without a receipt) and agreed to put the belt on for only the cost of the labor.  They called me a couple hour later to report that they had narrowed the dripping fluid problem to two possible options. I needed to replace all my cooling hoses which were starting to show signs of aging and I needed to replace something related to my a/c compressor. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of a 5 is because they weren't sure which of the two was actually the problem. They wanted me to do both for over $700!! Which was about $400 over my budget.   I shared my budget and asked him to choose which of the two problems was the most pressing and the result of the dripping fluid. He was either unable to answer or unwilling because he wanted so much for me to do both.. I couldn't tell.  Eventually I decided to go with the hose replacement. We go to San Diego pretty frequently and I'm always nervous going over that mountain range near Jacumba with all the "beware of car over-heating" signs.  Unfortunately, within a few days I realized that wasn't the problem as the fluid still leaks on my garage floor. A follow-up trip to NAPA revealed that my A/C compressor is leaking oil and needs to be replaced. So kudos to Sun Devil Auto for identifying that as a problem, but I'm disappointed they couldnt tell the difference between compressor lubricant and engine coolant.  Either way, I'd go back. They're good folks, in a good location with fair rates.

Edit: I saved the money to have the A/C fixed and went back in to the same Sun Devil Auto in September (4 months after the initial inspection and bid). To my surprise they upped the price on the repair by more than 70%. On top of that, they held my car for the entire day before telling me. I took it someplace else and wont return to Sun Devil Auto.

So much awesomeness there's no reason to watch a movie any place else. The leather recliners are amazing! Assigned seating that allows you to buy your tickets in advance, skip the long lines, and know you have a good seat is AMAZING. This is my favorite theater, ever.   Did I mention its amazing? I mean it.

The good: I got my oil changed pretty quickly (35 mins) and everything seems to be in good working shape.  The bad: I was standing in line to pay and the assistant manager was going through his routine with the customer in front of me. He was trying to upsell him on synthetic oil, a new air filter, a new cabin filter, and he charged the guy $5 to top off his fluids. He just came across like a really slimy used car sales man and it made my skin crawl.   More importantly, when he finished with that customer he ran off without even acknowledging me or the 10 minutes I stood there waiting to pay. He never mentioned he'd be right back and just left me standing there. After about 5 minutes I walked in to the bay and hollered for someone to come help me. Frankly, the place wasn't that busy and he had a lot of people on the garage floor so I'm not sure exactly why the customer service was so bad.  Ultimately I'll return and give them a chance to improve this rating and review but for now I wasn't that impressed with the service.

My palette isn't very sophisticated so I have to admit right off the bat I didnt understand most of the menu. I met here for a lunch meeting with someone who, thankfully, has a firm grasp on finer dining.   I had the Spek. I dont remember the fancy terms used to describe it but basically it was a ham and cheese sandwich on some sort of flat bread. It was pretty good, and for a restaurant with a lot of fancy sounding food the price was really reasonable. Less than $10 per person as I recall.  The only downside was that its very small inside and the sound of people talking crescendos to the point that I could barely hear myself think, let alone hear what my lunch colleagues were saying.   In the end, I left well fed and happy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something new and interesting.

The quality of the food has really plummeted over the past year. We use to love coming her to get the creamy clam chowder, not its watery and gross. The nachos were awesome, now the cheese looks brown and disgusting. After 7+ years of coming regularly we likely won't be back.

My young children love Panda Express orange chicken. They eat it 2-4 times a month. We were at the mall on a Saturday afternoon and stopped into the food court to have lunch. The kids ordered the orange chicken and happily started to eat. To our surprise, it was spicy. I noticed the color was a bit dark compared to normal but then I realized they must have mistakenly made it wrong. They were adamant it was made correctly and wouldnt provide a refund. It was completely inedible for my kids we had to throw it away and get them some pizza.   We're still deciding whether we'll be returning to any Panda Express but certainly never again to this one.

Two sides of this review:  1. They do a good job of washing the car. I have no complaints and keep going back because they send some pretty good coupons in the mail on a regular basis.   2. Be prepared to be swarmed with cheesy sales guys. First you get the guy trying to upsell you a hand wax or interior detail. He/she doesnt easily take no for an answer. And trust me, when they tell you a wax and interior detail will only take 40 minutes, he is absolutely lying to you. I'm a bit of an easy sell so I've agreed to do it a few times. Not once has it EVER been less than 1.5 hours.. ever. But when I tell them I dont have time they always tell me it will only take 30-40 minutes.  The next guy is trying to sell windshield repairs. He'll get you the moment you finish with the other sales guy. As I mentioned before, I'm an easy sell so I once agreed to do this. The guy promised it would only take 15 minutes, it took an hour. They had to fill out some paperwork and call my insurance company (Progressive) and then I had to talk with my insurance company.. blah blah blah. An hour later I get my car and it seriously looks like someone just took super glue and smeared it over the tiny little chips I had in the windshield. It was such a crock. Nothing but a scam.  This car washing experience would be so much better if they eliminated the windshield repair guys.

Stay away from this hospital! Go ANY place else. The care wasn't bad, however, the price for service is insanity. They charged me 5x or more Honor Health's posted cash costs for the same services. I could have gone to ANY Honor Health facility and had the exact same services and a bill that was 80% less.   When I called offering to make full payment on the account if they would give me cash prices they stated nothing could be done because it had already been run through insurance and I was responsible for the remaining amount. $3K in out of pocket expenses for what turned out to be a sprained ankle.  If you're on the way, stop. Find any place else to go. If you're already there, leave immediately. This place is full of crooks.

The Good Its a beautiful gym, has plenty of space with everything you could possibly want. The locker rooms are fantastic and the pool is a blast for kids.  The Bad Working with their sales team feels like a used car experience.  Ongoing service is sketchy at best. When you have any concerns or problems they have no real interest in helping, only in moving you along like a cog in a factory.   The environment feels more like a social gathering than a work-out facility.   The price is ridiculous.

This is the nicest bowling alley I've ever seen. It's a whole other experience. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the price to bowl is insane. For a family of 4 it's $75-100. Wow!

Drove all the way up to this store from Gilbert because they had the television I wanted at a fair price. I called ahead and everything was ready for me when I arrived. The associate that helped me was friendly and quick, he even helped me load it into the SUV.   On a related note, there was a brief wait while I waited to pay. I happened to notice a microwave that matched a new refrigerator and dishwasher I had purchased at the Spencer's in Gilbert the day before. The microwave and the matching stove were exactly what I wanted and they were on SALE! So I bought those to and had them delivered to my home the next day.   Great selection and great prices! I love this store.

My heart sank the moment I realized that my wallet was still at home on the counter right next to the garage door.   I met a colleague for lunch. It was great food, great service and a comfortable environment. The check came and everything was going great until I reached for my wallet. I didnt have it. I thanked my colleague for his company and sent him on his way noting that I wanted to hang out a little longer.   I informed the host at the front door that a manager was needed because I had forgotten my wallet and then I called my wife to get my AMEX number.   To my surprise, the manager walked over and thanked me for my patronage. Encouraged me to come back and then kindly offered to cover the bill on my behalf.   That kind of service deserves 10 stars but because I can only give 5 they get that for sure. This place is simply awesome and this is an experience I will continue to tell people for years to come.   I was already a fan of Z Tejas but now I'm a raving fan!

The family and I stopped in this afternoon (Saturday) and the place was pretty slow. It was my first trip to this location, though Ive been to the Scottsdale location on several occasions.  The first thing I noticed is that this location is beautiful. From the two large bars to the outside patio I felt immediately comfortable and had flash backs of spending Spring Break in Cabo.  Our server was gorgeous, just incredible. I cant recall her name but she reminded me of a younger, more attractive Thandie Newton. So within just a couple of minutes I was ready to give our visit 5 stars.   Unfortunately things went south fast. After our server took the drink order she just disappeared for about 10 minutes. Since we had just come from playing miniature golf (in the middle of summer) the kids were very thirsty and this long departure made it very difficult for them... and us.  She finally returned and took our order. That went pretty smooth. We didnt order anything unusual or "off the menu." My wife decided to have a Strawberry Margarita.  Again the server disappeared, this time for over 20 minutes. So by this point we've been in the restaurant over half an hour and we still dont have our food and my wife never received her margarita... on a very slow Saturday afternoon.  I caught the attention of a manager and asked him to refill our drinks and check on our food. He returned a couple moments later with our server in tow and food in hand. It looked good, but the plates were scorching hot and the food was lukewarm, which is usually a sign the food has been sitting in the expo window for a long time.  The food tasted good, including my wife's chicken quesadilla... unfortunately she ordered a steak quesadilla. By this point we were just happy to have food so we didnt complain.  The manager seemed very apologetic and offered us a free appetizer for our next trip, which isnt likely to ever happen at this location. I would have preferred a discount on the bill or maybe an offer of dessert but no luck.

Terrible service, completely inept technicians.   SanTan Import Service Center's used car presale inspection is a complete waste of money and their "expert technicians" are even worse.   I took them a used 2003 Honda Accord that I was interested in purchasing. On the way to their service center I noticed the air conditioning did not blow cold even in the slightest. So when I spoke with their service advisor I specifically asked them to look into the problem.  After an hour and a half (I was told it would take 30 minutes) they returned the car to me with a laundry list of small items that needed to be fixed. The largest and most critical were front brakes and the air conditioning needed to be recharged with freon.   Great! I bought the car. I took it to them the next day to have the front brakes replaced and to charge the air conditioning.  Then I get a call. The air conditioning unit is not getting power. They are going to have to explore the problem. After a full day and a half they still cant find the problem and recommend I take it to the dealer. But they still charged me $110 for the air condition service, even though it still doesn't work.  The dealer tells me the car has electrical issues that will cost $300+ to repair and the air conditioning needs major repair ($1,600). They have no idea how SanTan Import Service Center could overlook something as easy to diagnose as the A/C not getting power.  A call to their GM results in a "oops, sorry we didnt find those problems" but nothing else. Grr...

Disappointed. That sums up my two experiences with this Dunkin' Donuts.   This location is right around the corner from my house. We are not  donut connoisseurs or food snobs so our expectations are pretty fair and reasonable. We usually buy donuts from Walmart or Albertsons but will make a trip out to Krispy Kreme on occasion. We are big junk food eaters though so when my wife and I first heard a Dunkin' Donuts was going into the shopping plaza we were very excited. The day it opened there was some buzz in our neighborhood and within a few days we stopped in with the family.  My first thought was disappointment in the variety and selection. Years ago when I use to visit a different Dunkin' Donuts on a semi-regular basis I really enjoyed all the different types of donuts from jelly and kreme filled to glazed and chocolate cake. They didnt have chocolate or bavarian kreme filled. None of the chocolate covered cake donuts. Frankly the selection is much better at the Super Walmart down the road.  We quickly picked a dozen donuts and headed home eager to dig in. Again, we were only disappointed. The vanilla kreme filled donuts were incredibly skimpy on filling. The glazed donuts were dense and not light and fluffy. Two days later we ended up throwing away 4 left over donuts and that has NEVER happened in this house.  The second trip was nearly identical. We were disappointed by the selection and the taste/quality was an even bigger disappointment. I can only assume they must be trying to cut costs by being so skimpy with the donut filling.   In passing conversations with others in our neighborhood they've expressed similar experiences. We will not be returning for a third trip. Its back to Walmart and Albertson's donuts until Krispy Kreme builds a store a little closer to our house. Shame on Dunkin' Donuts for being so cheap at the expense of its quality.

Our house look amazing. They did an excellent job.  Pros Mike's pricing was very competitive. It included the tile, prep work and installation.   Mike has a very consultative approach. He brought samples, shared insights on layout, and made some solid recommendations (diagonal placement, small grout lines, etc) that we took and are grateful for it.  The team was great. Very friendly, hard-working, and talented. They respected our house, laid plastic over the carpeted areas and cleaned up after themselves. More importantly, the intricacy and detail on some of the tile cuts amazed my wife. Its obvious they take great pride in their work.  Mike and his foreman stopped in several times each day of the job to check-in and make sure things were progressing smoothly. He was there to answer questions and provide updates. His foreman was professional and knowledgeable.   I HIGHLY recommend Abel Carpet Tile and Wood for any tile work. When we're ready to lay new carpet upstairs we'll call Mike first.

My wife and I stopped in looking for a new washer and dryer. We were quickly greeted and shown a large selection of well priced options. The associate that helped us was very knowledgeable and answered a wide range of questions. He offered to match any price and even volunteered to do a bit of research to show that the price we were getting was lower than other options (Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowes, and Sears). So we chose the top of the line front loading Maytag washer/dryer.  While we were there we also decided to buy their top of the line Maytag two door and a bottom drawer (freezer) refrigerator. We had it delivered the next day. All together we spent just over $6,500.   Great experience, so far.  The next day everything was delivered without a problem. The guys were in and out fast, they were friendly, and cleaned up after themselves. Before they left, I noticed one of the refrigerator door shelves was missing. They told me to just call the store and they would get one right over to me. So I did, within just a few minutes.  This is where the experience tanked.  When I called, my original sales associate was out for the day. The guy who answered the phone took my information and said it would be no problem to get the shelf ordered and to my house within a few days. I waited two weeks, nothing.  So I called back and spoke to my original associate. He couldn't find an order for the shelf but said he would take care of it. I waited two weeks, nothing.  I called back and spoke to the original associate, he said it should arrive any day. I waited two weeks, nothing.  Finally, 6 weeks after I placed a $6,500 order I stopped back into the store and talked to my original sales associate. I was frustrated, but I was not rude. The associate however was very short with me, as if I was bothering him. He walked over to the floor model, took the shelf out, and brought it back to me.   I was still curious if I should expect to receive the other shelf in the mail and inquired about it. To which he replied in a condescending tone, "you have the shelf. Is there anything else I can help you with?"   I've waited a couple months to write this review because I was hoping that the earlier great experience would wash away my memories and feelings about the poor service I received at the end. It didn't. I wouldn't go back to this store because I know if there was an issue, I couldn't count on them to put their best foot forward and help me solve it.

Terrible. The food was bad. The service was PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW. Drink refills? No chance. They appeared to have plenty of servers and the place wasn't that busy.   Don't waste your money, there are plenty of better options in the area.

This place is so good I seriously couldn't stop thinking about my left-overs and actually got pretty excited around dinner time knowing I was having the second half of my sandwich.  I highly recommend Firehouse Subs and plan to eat there as frequently as possible.

Its so rare to find a mechanic that you can trust, is affordable, does a kick ass job, and delivers excellent customer service to boot. Josh and his team at Family Auto Care have impressed me time and time again. These are good hardworking people and I highly recommend them.

This is absolutely the most amazing convenience store and gas station on the planet. The beverage selection is extraordinary. Any kind of soda you can imagine, a large selection of ICEE flavors, milkshakes, any kind of coffee you could want and so much more. I stop here as often as possible.

Buyer beware of the "Lifetime Warranty" on the Ghost Armor for your phones. I had it installed on my iPhone a few months after I purchased it. Within two weeks it was bubbling and falling off so I took it back.  Its painfully slow for them to go through the process and each time was left wandering the store for nearly 30 minutes waiting for them to finish. Thankfully there's plenty to explore for me but the kids were getting grumpy.  Flash forward 6 months and my Ghost Armor is again bubbling, scratched and falling off. I took the phone back in and now I have to pay another $10 "service charge" to have them replace it. What the...?   That's a nice little scam. Every 6 months you gotta go back and pay another $10 to get the Ghost Armor fixed. Sort of like buying razors and having to go back every few months and pay for refills.  I know its not a lot but the original install was $30 so another $20/yr to maintain it is annoying.  That said, the store is beautiful. Its clean, spacious, a huge selection and my family and I buy all of our electronics (computers, televisions, cameras, etc) and many of our movies and accessories here.   Just stay away from the Ghost Armor and you'll be set.

Wasted more than 20 minutes waiting in the drive-thru. When we got our order, the ice cream cones were already melting and there was a BUG (gross) in our mini blizzard when we took the lid off.   We decided not to return and get our money back because we didn't want to waste even one more second there. Everything went into the garbage and we went to another ice shoppe.

The New England Clam Bake was thin, the clams were tiny (yes I know we're in the desert), overall I was disappointed and will not be returning.

I brought my Isuzu Rodeo into this location of Brakes Plus during the first week of January 2010 because I received a coupon in the mail and had heard the radio commercials.   Everything started off great. I was greeted by a nice guy named Kenny. I explained to him that I heard some squeaking and minor grinding when I slowed and asked him to check my brakes. I told him that I had just had one set replaced within the previous 6 months by Big-O but couldn't recall which set.   I left the car and went to the movies with my wife. About 2 hours later Kenny called and told me that I needed to replace front and back brakes and that my shocks where shot and needed to be replaced.   By this time I had already run home (prior to the movie) and checked my Big-O receipt to see which set had been replaced. It was the front brakes, in June 2009. So when he told me both needed to be replaced I again told him they had just been replaced within the past 6 months.   He said the pads were completely cracked and that he was authorized by his manager to do a core trade-in which would save me $20-30 if I wanted to just avoiding having to deal with Big-O and have Brakes Plus replace the brakes.   At this point I had no reason to distrust Kenny so I was completely livid with Big-O. I chose not to replace the front brakes because I wanted to take the car back to Big-O, slam my keys on the counter and yell WTF!! I did choose to have the back brakes replaced but passed on the shocks because it wasnt in the budget.  Brakes Plus finished with the car at nearly 5pm (I dropped it off at 10am) and I drove straight to Big-O. After a brief unpleasant exchange with the store manager they pulled my Rodeo into the shop immediately and with me standing right there pulled the wheels off and extracted the brake pads.  Nothing. The brake pads were in great shape. No cracks, no unusual wear. Nothing. I was so embarrassed I wanted to crawl under a rock and hide.   At that point I asked them to inspect my shocks. They were fine. Told me I probably had another 10-15K miles left on them.   Argg! Did I really even need back brakes? I have no idea. Either way, this is a customers greatest fear when their car needs work, being taken advantage of by the mechanic. The behavior is unethical and unprofessional. I'm still trying to decide whether I should contact the Better Business Bureau or not.  If you need brakes, take your car any place else but Brakes Plus.

The family and I love this place. The pizza is fantastic, they load on the toppings. Definitely try the Chicken Supreme. You won't be disappointed.    My kids really enjoy playing and eating in the kids area and devour the pizza.   The price is very reasonable and even more so when considering all the food you get. I highly recommend Barro's Pizza.

I'm conflicted about this review. My kids and I stopped in one day while riding bikes to have some quick lunch. It was my first visit and I had not heard or read anything about it. My wife mentioned it was somewhat new to the neighborhood and we like to support the local community.  My first impression was that the price was a bit steep compared to other pizza options in the area. But since I heard it was Chicago style, I figured the focus was on the quality.   To my disappointment, the pizza tasted OK but it wasn't great. Not for the price. It was no better than Papa John's, certainly not as good as Barros, but 30-40% more expensive. Had the experience ended there I would have given them a one star review.  However, the owners (?) unexpectedly brought out some sort of bread w/chocolate and powdered sugar for my kids, at no cost. That made them feel very special, and ultimately what makes them happy, makes me happy.   So, for going the extra mile by providing a happy and memorable dining experience for my kids, I would recommend them.

DO. NOT. WASTE. YOUR. MONEY.  I know what you're thinking: How bad could this be? No way Marvel would endorse something that isn't 100% awesome. This must be a guy who went on the first day when they had glitches, it has to have gotten so much better since then.   Don't do it. Marvel really duped us on this one. There are two decent activities to participate in (a shooting game and a maze) but both require a full hour wait and last only a few minutes at best. The rest of the area has very little interactivity. I went several days after the opening night and everything was working, nothing was out of service. Despite that, my kids (7 and 9) were bored the entire night.   The 3D/4D graphic shows were cool, but they were very brief and not at all worth the $150 we paid for a family of 5. I'd love to have time travel as a super power so I could go back and tell myself not to waste the money or the time. Hopefully, you don't make the same mistake.
