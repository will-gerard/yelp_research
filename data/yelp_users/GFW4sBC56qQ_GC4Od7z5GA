This is our go to place for take out.  Everything is always hot and delicious.  The broccoli in garlic sauce is delicious and the pork fried rice is amazing!   The hot and sour soup is hit or miss.  The broth is always great but sometimes it's just loaded with nothing but tofu while other times it has all sorts of goodness!    There isn't much on the menu I wouldn't recommend.

Have eaten here before, but today will be our last.  Waitress has been inattentive,  ice tea tasted off,  food was not cooked as requested.  It's extremely dusty and there is crayon on the booth dividers.  The prices on breakfast for two are higher than they used to be.  We'll stick with mom & pop diners from now on.

Have bought two new vehicles in the last month.  Go see Kristy in fleet,  you won't be disappointed!  She is amazing and treats you like family.

I'm not entirely sure why I continually punish myself by going here.  $28 for a car wash that is worse than when you go to a fundraising car wash.  It's seriously terrible.  My windshield still had spots and dirt all over it and they don't wipe down the inside at all.  I'm not sure why it takes so long considering how little they do.  It's so frustrating!

Decided to try last night based on the reviews,  and it did not disappoint!  The ruby red sangria was fantastic!  But they have three different types,  so I'll be back to try them all!    Hubby had the seafood fettuccine,  it has a pesto Alfredo sauce.  He isn't fond of pesto so he wasn't a huge fan.  He did say the seafood was delicious.    I had the veal parm and it was amazing!  The spaghetti caputo that accompanied the veal was seriously delicious and I could eat heaping bowls of it!    The service was great.  Our waitress was warm and friendly without hovering.    Great Italian!  We'll be back!

What a great family owned breakfast spot.  We are always searching for new mom chain restaurants,  and this is a place we will revisit!  Food was amazing.  I had the chorizo waffle.  Sounds odd,  I know.  It was heaven. Shredded cheese,  sour cream,  pico. So fantastic. Hubby ordered the corned beef and eggs. He really enjoyed them.  We shared biscuits and gravy which were fabulous.    The server was friendly and i enjoyed Mark's singing from the window!    Love this place!

I'm in need of a new nail salon and after checking yelp, this is where I landed.  First visit was pretty great.  Tiffany was great and did a great glitter ombre on my mani/pedi. I will be back for sure.

Service: Our waitress was fabulous.  She was friendly and helpful without being annoying,  if you know what I mean.    Decor: completely laid back and comfortable.  Fyi, you will make a mess here and its acceptable to eat with your hands.  They just put bags of hot steamy goodness in your table and you dig in.  Then they roll up the table cloth and throw it all away.    Food: the snow crab is seriously amazing.  We are talking hallelujah choir amazing.  The shrimp was so so,  but the waitress said they have been working on a cooking technique for their shrimp.  The king crab was good,  solid choice.  Dungeness was well,  I've honestly never had it before and it may have been fabulous but i couldn't get past the eyes and fur. Lol,  but that's on me i suppose.  The Cajun fries are solid.  Cole slaw was good between spicy bites of seafood goodness.  They also give you a basket of limes and a dish of salt and pepper with instructions to squeeze the limes into the salt mixture.  Dip your crab into it from time to time,  it's delicious.    Will be back for sure!  Thanks Dan for the great food!

We've visited several times but Friday we ordered delivery and as always is was fantastic!   I'm seriously addicted to their pizza crust.  It just tastes so good!  No cardboard here!  The toppings are always plentiful and great quality.    Meatball sub was to die for and the calzones are straight from heaven!  Loaded with melted cheesy goodness!    This is our go to for pizza!  A little pricey but worth every penny!
