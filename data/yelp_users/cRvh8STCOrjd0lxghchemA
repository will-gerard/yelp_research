If you call in your order it's so much faster than ordering when you get there.  Super clean and friendly.  I order a couple times a month for dinner.  Your phone number usually looks up frequent orders so most of the time I don't have to tell them my usual order it's already in there system which makes it faster.  Avoid weekends it's usually busy and not a lot of parking at all.

Very slow took forever to get my drink, wasn't even crowed!!!! One of the girls took out trash didn't was her hands and continued to serve drinks.  Older lady who looked to be shift manager put the whip cream bottle on side of garage can to help someone at cashier.  What where these people thinking!?!?  I will skip going to Starbucks at Thunderbird road next time.
