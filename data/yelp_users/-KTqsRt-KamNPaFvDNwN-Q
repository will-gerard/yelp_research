Thanks Walt's Had 2 watches that needed resizing, took them to Walt's and in less than 10 had them fitting perfectly.  While waiting my wife and I took a look around and was treated very nicely by another sales lady while browsing.

I can not buy suits off of the rack to my large athletic frame, several places said that whatever I would buy from them would need to have the panels cut, the pockets moved the lapel moved and it probably would not look just right.  Most other places I called had very long waits after the fitting to receive the suits.  I was referred to Thaku's, called them that day, spoke to Neal and he said to come down, I did and was shown first class service, bought 2 new custom tailored suits that will be available for fitting in 3 - 4 weeks and will build my professional wardrobe with them in the coming months.  Love this place, they have a new loyal customer.  Thank You Neal for your help.  Carl Modrick

Dont let the size of the restaurant fool you, the staff is always friendly and the sushi is expertly done.  I have never had something I did not like here.

I have no idea of the what/when/who of why the service was bashed here?  Just visited for first time and the service was great!  It's not an extensive menu, but it is not supposed to be, it's a wine bar.  With that being said the bruschetta's are amazing.  Thank you Bryan, our server, for the wonderful service, great job and we will be back.

One of our "go to" places for a good quick meal...or even a longer one with friends.   Great food, great service, laid back eclectic crowd.

Definitely one of our favorite lunch places.  We have not had a lunch that we haven't really liked.  This is turning into one of our regular spots.

1 star might be too high of a rating, worked out here before when it was 24 Hour and though I would give it another shot now that it is LA Fitness,  shouldn't have wasted my time.  The energy was about the same as a morgue and the only other person in my age demographic was some dueachbeag in a sleeveless hoodie...wearing sunglasses..while he worked out.  It was like a retirement village facility.  Make the time to drive to the one on Gilbert and the 202.  Much better atmosphere, much better energy and better equipment.
