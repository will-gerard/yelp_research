I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds.

Weeknight, Hiro Sushi was crowded.    Greeted by the Sushi chefs as we entered.  Back at you, whatever you said!  Sat down, ordered copious amounts of delicious sushi, sashimi and sake.  Stopped eating long enough to look around and realize we were the only non-Asian table in the restaurant.  Great service.  We will be back!

I know how to sew...rarely do I require the service of a tailor, except when it comes to hemming jeans.  When you have spent $$$ on a great pair of jeans, the last thing you want to do is walk around on your cuffs or lose the great stitching on your hems.  Mr. Wong removes the original jean hem, shortens your pants, and then reattaches the original hem so as not to loose the cool stitching.   The beauty of his technique is that the new hem does not flip up.  It lies flat and is almost impossible to tell that your designer jeans have been shortened.  And he is very affordable!     So, when I don't feel like pulling out my old trusty Singer, I run over to Mr. Wong.

We have been coming here forever. The long bar is a great place to grab a cocktail or glass of wine on a weekend, but the real reason to dine at Cowboy Ciao are two of their signature dishes: The Stetson Salad and The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. The salad is mixed table side. Order your own, you will not want to share it. Fresh arugula, plum tomatoes, salmon, corn kernels and couscous, blended with a dressing that will make your mouth happy. Yum, I get hungry just writing about it. The Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is just as good. It is a mix of shitake, oyster, black trumpet, morel, magic (just kidding), porcini and any other kind of mushroom the kitchen can lay their hands on, swimming in an ancho cream sauce and served over polenta with avocado on top. Double yum! This is a great dish to share or order in the appetizer size.

Neiman Marcus has the merchandise; there is no denying that fact.  All I can really say about the Scottsdale Fashion Square Neiman Marcus is consistently WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE of any retail establishment I have ever tried to shop at.  For the past 16 years, I have lost count of how many times I have been ignored, rudely treated, or had to suffer through a salesperson's condescending attitude, all while spending my money.  I recently mentioned this to my husband, and he responded, "Just walk in wearing scrubs and they trip over each other trying to help you."  I laughed, because my physician husband only goes to NM to buy me a gift with a list in his hand.  If only those stupid salespeople knew whom they were disrespecting...they might jump off their high horses and help the wife of the scrub wearer.  Recently I have started doing most of my shopping in Dallas where my daughter goes to school.  I discovered that the NM at North Park Mall is a wonderful store; more upscale than Scottsdale's NM and staffed with charming, helpful salespeople, much like our Nordstrom (I love Scottsdale Nordstrom!)  Today the last straw broke the proverbial camels back while I was yet again treated rudely while trying on a pair of Louboutin's.  Accompanied by my daughter and my best friend, the three of us stood in disbelief at the shoe salesgirl's insolence.  Oh, well, lost sale at Scottsdale Fashion Square Neiman Marcus,  I am done.  Hello Barney's!

I am not a Binkley's fan.  I know ... Kevin Binkley was recently nominated for a James Beard, Howard Seftel awarded it 5 stars, but really, it is overrated, overpriced and a just a little more than tired.  Thankfully, the whole deconstrution and molecular gastronomy craze seem to be disappearing from menus. Truthfully, when dining out, I appreciate beautiful fresh ingredients prepared simply without the pretense. When did food have to become so technical that it resembles a high school chemistry lab assignment more than a meal? Meals at Binkley's are exhausting and often comical.  They are orchestrated more as performing art than as a meal to be enjoyed.  Having previously dined at Binkley's on several occasions, I will not be driving the 20 miles to Cave Creek. The restaurant is in a seedy, run down strip mall, cost hundreds of dollars, and when finished, all we really want to do is stop on the way home and have a burger because we are still hungry.

Butterfield's is in my neighborhood.   Have been a customer from almost their first day open. Rock solid breakfast. Lots of regulars there. All of the standards plus a few greats (the bacon skillet with poached eggs on top is a good one!) I have had breakfast at "Butterball's" (as my teenagers affectionally refer to it) probably in excess of 50 times.  If you are a hater, go somewhere else, more room for those of us who love good service, a smile and a breakfast that is as fit or fattening as you desire.  I have had just about everything on the menu, including lunch, and my only complaint is their coffee.  A bit bitter.  Love, love, love the OJ.  On Sundays, get there early before the post-church crowd....

My new favorite neighborhood spot.  Love the bar, I completely expect  Cliff and Woody to yell "Laura!" as I walk through the door.  What a great place.  Order the Blue Plate Special, you will not be disappointed.  I truly hate to Yelp about this place...it is that good!

Sunnyslope Art Walk... happy hour at Bomberos....  hanging with my honey... Saturday evenings don't get much better.   What a great place.  My husband works at John C. and has been telling me we need to get over to Bomberos.  Tonight we did.  Sat at the bar and enjoyed happy hour (1/2 off) glasses of malbec.  Panini and bruschetta (wow, it is fabulous) rounded out a perfect shared meal.  What a great place!

Three of us went to Fresh Mint today for lunch.  We did not like it.  We started with an order of Summer Rolls.  Yuck, they were a piece of tofu and shredded cabbage rolled in rice paper, served with a thick, unappealing peanut sauce studded with raw peanuts. Presentation was nice, but it did not taste like anything except cabbage wrapped in rice paper.  My companions each ordered Pad Thai and I had the Five Spice Pho.  The Pad Thai arrived first. I looked at it and was very happy I did not order it.  It looked like a plate of gummy sauce-covered glop.  Tasted as bad as it looked. My Five Spice Pho looked delicious, but did not have any flavor.  Adding the hot sauce that is served on the side, only added heat, but no flavor.  The broth tasted like water.  We did like the Mint Lemonade, but at $3.95 a glass, it was pretty pricey.  Our lunch bill came to $44.  Very expensive for what we were served.  Needless to say, I am crossing Fresh Mint off my list.  No reason to go back.  I gave it 2 stars out of respect for the Yelpers that think it is so great, but actually, I would rather give it one.  Vegetarian does not have to be bland and tasteless.

I finally spent the night at the Phoenix Downtown Sheraton.  It is a beautiful hotel.  Previously, my husband and I have attended several Black Tie Events (John C. Lincoln Health Foundation Night of Gold) in its massive ballroom.  It is a wonderful venue for a charity event.  But my only true hotel experiences were the ballroom, common areas, the gorgeous lobby and bar.  I felt that before I could really review a hotel property, I had to sleep there.    Lady Gaga recently came to Phoenix to strut her stuff. A few of us decided we had to see this and needed a home base close to US Airways Arena.  A 30th floor 2-bedroom suite at the Downtown Phoenix Sheraton perfectly fit the bill.  With 4 of us spending the night a few friends joined us as we primped and partied in anticipation of seeing Mama Monster.  Everything about the Sheraton was seamless.  Parking valet, check in, and bellman were very efficient.  The room was WOW! There were two bedrooms, each connecting to a common living room with a view of downtown Phoenix and South Mountain beyond.  We were able to watch all of the concert activity around US Airways from our windows!     Furnishings are new and tasteful in a very clean simple way.  Contemporary prints of cacti decorate the walls. Bathrooms are large and stocked with nice toiletries.  The beds are WONDERFUL with white down comforters and lots of fluffy pillows.  Flat screen TVs, large work desks, bar in living room, cordless telephones, black out drapes (very important after a gaga night!) and even an efficient video check out.  I will return again to the Downtown Sheraton and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling on business or enjoying an evening in the Phoenix downtown area.

Pinch me!  I must not be in Arizona anymore... Cafe Monarch could be in a small village square in Tuscany or a foggy northern coastal town of California, but no, it is right here... hidden away on 1st Avenue in Scottsdale!  I have found my new favorite restaurant.  Off the beaten path, in a cute, self styled space, Christopher has made a comfortable and wonderful cafe.  Original, charming, and completely without attitude.  Leave yourself in Christopher's hands and he will serve you a meal that will make you smile.  Great ingredients, simply prepared and beautifully served.   Call ahead for dinner, bring a bottle of wine, some cash and let Chris decide what to make you.  You will be in very capable hands. Do what you love and the rest will follow!

Last night I hosted a party of 28 at Cafe Monarch for my husband's 50th Birthday.  Christopher (and his wonderful assistant David!) handled everything beautifully.  Our guest were blown away by the venue, food, and comfortable atmosphere ... not an easy thing to pull off with this crowd.  Calamari and shrimp ceviche, prosciutto with cantaloupe salad, pork loin ratatouille, and a dessert of fresh strawberries with sweet whipped cream over puff pastry drizzled with chocolate... it was perfect!  We brought cases of wine and champagne and we had a beautiful, fun wine bar. For an evening in mid May, the weather completely cooperated and we were able to dine on the front porch.  We had a wonderful time... as I was able to completely leave all the details to Chris with the complete confidence that it would be wonderful.  I was not disappointed.  We had a relaxed evening celebrating with friends and family. Thank you again, Christopher.

Stopped at Jasper's Peak tonight with my honey for dinner.  Called ahead, but they do not take reservations for parties less than 6.  HUH? When we arrived, the inside booths were full and the patio was filling.  We opted for a high top table by the door in the bar area.  Acknowledged by a waitress, we were given place settings and menus.  That was the last we saw of her.   Because we were by the door, we began to feel like we were the official greeters, as there is not a hostess station.  Eager groups of diners entered and stood at our elbows, waiting (jostling) for a table.  After about 10 minutes, we fled our table for the wide-open bar.  Settling in, we realized that there was a true staffing problem.  The bar tender disappeared, never making eye contact with us.  About 5 minutes later, a bleached blond waitress entered the bar to get her orders.  My husband said "hi", she, quite surprised said "hi" back and proceeded to complete her order and exit.  We sat there in disbelief.  Looking at the menu, nothing made us say, "wow, I would love to try that".  We then came to the complete understanding (and conclusion) that we were not going to get the service that we deserved.  We left, walked across the parking lot to LOCAL BISTRO and HAD AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC MEAL AND EVENIING...but that is another review.  Sorry, Jasper's....fail.

Seriously good coffee.  Cinnamon goodness is the Matador.   Barista finished it off with a beautiful fan latte design....I almost hated to drink it!   Love the big cups, the space, the proximity to Brophy.  It has a soul.    Yeah, I'm a fan.

Just got back from a fun filled day with my husband and seven 13 year old boys at Wet 'n' Wild.  Not sure what I expected, but I was completely wowed!  We had a blast. Arrived right before opening, rented a cabana, and started having a great day.  Before lunch we hit ALL of the slides several times with little or no lines.  Now, it was only a 78 degree Sunday in May (can you believe it!!!) but the crowds were not there.   After lunch we did start to see more people arrive as the lines grew longer, so we spent the next few hours hanging out in the wave pool.   The slides were FUN and FAST!  As a Mom, I was very impressed with their construction and the water cleanliness.  Lifeguard staff was very attentive and plentiful.  Security seemed to be well handled with several pairs of off duty Phoenix PD walking around.  Food choices were good.  Plenty of lounge chairs and lots of shade.  Landscaping was attractive and there are even a few mature trees.  The reasons i did not give Wet 'n' Wild the 5th star are: 1.  $34.99 price is pretty steep  (but for a limited time can be applied toward a $60.00 season pass) 2.  $6 parking is ridiculous 3.  having to rent a tube for the wave pool is wrong, tubes should be included with the high entry fee 4.  Tried to contact Wet 'n' Wild for several weeks through voice mail and email to arrange this birthday party and NO ONE EVER RETURNED A CALL OR EMAIL.  Now having said all of that, why aren't there more water parks in the Phoenix area?  We live in hotter-that-hell summer... someone build more water parks and they will come! Especially good ones like Wet 'n' Wild.  Did I buy season passes?  No, but I would if it were closer.  it is a 30 minute drive from my home in Scottsdale.  It was a great place to spend the day with my pack of boys!

Entering through the front door on 5th Avenue, 5th and Wine feels like a brightly lit coffee shop.  Continuing into the restaurant, past the bar, it opens up into a very large, vaulted ceiling dining room.  Unfortunately the noise level also elevates.   As we were escorted to our table, my husband said, "Look around at who is here."  The room was filled with tables of women.  I thought I had accidentally taken my husband to Arcadia Farms!  He commented that he thought the female to male ratio to be about 7:1.   I have to agree, and that included the male waiters!  Tables are very close together.  Because of the noise level, conversation was difficult.  Food was average. Menu was salads, sandwiches, a couple of pastas...seemed more like lunch than dinner.  Nothing to get too excited about.  So, if you are a group of loud, laughing, slightly inebriated women, desiring a lunch menu with your bottle(s) of wine for dinner, 5th and Wine is probably your place.    I'll pass.

At my age, it happens once a year.  Lean forward, place one breast on glass, have other piece of glass mechanically maneuver into place and squish breast flat.  Hold breath, release, breathe, and repeat on other side.   Smile, while trying to maintain some dignity. It is of course, a necessary evil in the world of modern medicine.   It was time for the dreaded mammogram.  I knew that John C.  Lincoln had recently opened a new Breast Center at their Deer Valley location, so when my favorite gynecologist asked me if I had a preference of where I would like to go, I said, "Yes, I think I want to try the new one at John C. Lincoln Deer Valley."    So, consult in hand, I called and scheduled an appointment.    I arrived 10 minutes early, as directed, and opened the door to a beautiful reception area.  Pink, tasteful and very feminine, in a hip kind of way.  I was immediately directed to a seat at the counter, where my insurance, medical history and hospital wristband were professionally and very privately handled.  From there I was directed to the sitting area, complete with comfy chairs and current magazines. Within minutes, I was lead back to a changing room, with lockers and monogrammed robes to change into.  Wow, it really was starting to feel like a spa.  From there I was taken through another beautiful decorated waiting room filled with natural light.  Ok, maybe this wasn't going to be so bad after all.  I had yet to even break a sweat or think about sprinting for the door.      After a short wait, I was led into the mammography room.  It was pink and happy and the Radiology Technician was friendly and professionally explained the procedure.  Then, without any loss of my dignity through artful draping of my robe, she guided me through the positions and placement needed for the 4 digital photos.  It was done, in less than 10 minutes.    I returned to the changing room, complete with deodorant (as directed, I did not use any before my mammogram), sink and mirror, to get dressed. I was done. I will hopefully hear that all was routine and we will see you again next year.  But the experience was really great. (I can't believe I said that about a mammogram) I felt like I was in a spa.  An offer of herbal tea, glass of wine, or a massage would not have surprised me!  hmmm... do you think insurance would cover that??  All joking aside, I know that breast cancer is a very serious subject.  If ever faced with that disease, I know that I will turn to the Doctors and Staff at the John C. Lincoln Breast Health and Research Center for support, knowledge and care.  Remind someone you love to get a mammogram.

Having two teenagers that spend every summer scuba diving off the Catalina Coast, it was not a matter of if we were going to visit the new SeaLife Aquarium at Arizona Mills, but when.  Not wanting to battle the grand opening crowds, we decided to wait until a midweek hot summer morning.  Arriving there at about 11am, 3 busloads of summer campers arrive just as we did and are escorted into the aquarium.   Ugh, we decided that a loop through the mall and maybe some lunch before we go see the fish.    Campers gone, we explore the aquarium with only our ankles under assault.  WHY DO THEY ALLOW STROLLERS IN SUCH A SMALL SEMI LIT, CONFINED SPACE?  Moms, do us all a favor and leave your stroller in your car.  If your child is not old enough to walk, this aquarium is not age appropriate.  That said, maybe management will read any of the current 3 reviews posted on Yelp and realize that strollers are a MAJOR problem.  The aisles and space between the exhibits are just too small to accommodate strollers and the crush of people.    The exhibits are kind of cheesy.  Plastic coral and lots of fake looking rock work. There is a funky smell. (No, it does not smell like the ocean!)  The lights are very dim and there are some poorly lit artificial rocks scattered throughout that everyone seems to scrape their legs on.  All the acrylic is scratched and cloudy.  It is extremely overpriced.  Not just expense,  EXTREMELY OVERPRICED FOR WHAT IT IS.  Should be $10 at the most.  It takes about an hour to see everything.  But...  This is the best public aquarium in the state of Arizona.  Sad reality.    So, if you would like to expose your family to the wonders of the ocean, go.  Just be aware of SeaLife 's major shortcomings, (and leave your &$*% stroller at home!)

I like Soi 4, not love, but a good like. I have been 3 times, twice for dinner and once for lunch.  Service has been good to very good.  Not having a lot of experience with Thai food, I always have a lot of questions and like to ask for menu explainations. My inquiries have always been met with smiles, good descriptions, and some great suggestions.  I love spicy food, but would not say that anything I have tried is overly spicy.  I have enjoyed most of the small plates and the Miang Kum is a personal favorite.  For lunch, the bento box is a good way to try a smaller taste of several different dishes.  This is a great place to order several things and dine family style with your companions.   The décor has a cool, urban vibe. Unfortunately, during busy times, it can be a bit noisy.  Upstairs there is another dining area that would be really great for a private party.    Love having Soi 4 in my neighborhood, it is a great addition to the Shops at Gainey  and I will definitely be back!

Stopped in for lunch after taking in the 7th Ave Street Fair.  I ordered the Parmesan crusted Swiss cheese burger with fries and my husband had the pastrami.  Yuck.  After waiting over 30 minutes for our order, Parmesan crusted cheese burger came out with no Parmesan crust, American cheese, limp lettuce, tomato, and a pre fab grey cooked frozen burger.  Fries were soft awful.  My husband's pastrami had one measly piece of meat on it.  A few bites into it, we decided it wasn't worth the calories and left. Complaining would have done no good, they were swamped from the street fair and really didn't care.  Bathroom was a dirty mess, too.  Won't be back.

JayneeBell Salon is a new salon owned by Michele DuVall.  Michele is pretty amazing...she has been doing nails for 20 years and decided that she really needed to become a Cosmetologist to fulfill the beauty needs of her clients. I have been a regular nail and pedicure client of Michele's for several years and happily moved into her stylist chair as soon as she opened JayneeBell.  So far I've had a great cut, color, highlights, Brazilian blowout, and she styled me for a very important Black Tie Event...and she still does my gel manis and pedicures. My husband and teenage son have stopped in for hair cuts, too.    Although Michele is a busy girl, she will bend over backward to fit you in.  I am very happy that she is doing more than just nails! Cute shop and very personal service.

A jewel box of a restaurant! I heard good things about The Gladly, so we decided to meet friends for dinner there last night. Until we arrived, I did not realize they had taken over the old Ruth Chris space.  I did know that it was the sister restaurant of Citizen Public House, so I had high expectations.  As the hostess escorted us, past THE AMAZING LOOKING BAR, I wanted to yell, "Wait, let's just hang out there!" But arriving at our table, I was not disappointed.  The elevated dining room gives a feeling of privacy, but still allows it's diners to check out what is going on around them.   Cocktails last night were Negroni's On Tap, followed by a bottle of Hearst Ranch Petite Sirah, suggested by our waiter, Tim, and all was good in the world.  Of course, we ordered a couple of The Original Chopped Salads to share. Three orders of Pan Seared Scallops (incredibly sweet and bacon-y) and one order of Coffee Charred Short Ribs, we were an incredibly happy table of diners. An Apple Tartlet and Buttermilk Bread Pudding for dessert was just over the top.  I appreciate that the menu indicates Gluten Free items and was able to help with a dairy intolerance substitution.  All around a great meal and a fun evening.  We will be back!
