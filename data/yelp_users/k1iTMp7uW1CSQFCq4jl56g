This is the hospital in which I gave birth in and my experience here was NOT great. I really feel like when you are admitted into a hospital, the nurses who are assigned to you truly make a big difference. Being there already is a sucky feeling bc who the hell likes being at the hospital?! Surely not I. It smells gross and makes me feel all depressed, so at the VERY least, you nurses better show your patients some great patient care damnit!!!  Anyway, I walk into the labor & delivery department and spot about 4 nurses just sitting there chit-chatting ('m assuming it was a slow night for them). They initially all just stared at me.. and one finally walks up and asks me unpleasantly with her bitchface on "How can I help you?" First of all, can you at least smile or something? Do you really hate your job that much that you can't even look friendly or approachable? Why are you even a nurse? And bitch, I am in effing pain so yes you can help me!!! OMGGGG these bitches.  OKAY.. I have a feeling this is gna turn into a novel and I will probably get a little out of control bc I get really angry when I think about my experience there...so I will do you all a favor and get to the point. All in all, the nurses that I had were all rude and annoying. Most of them were new graduates with NO experience whatsoever so I was pretty much their guinea pig during my hospital stay. Though I did have a really SWEET Filipino lady as my nurse during the night shift and she took great care of my baby and I. I wish I remembered her name so she can get the appropriate recognition for being so awesome bc girrrrrrrl let me tell ya, that is what a REAL nurse should be like. She was very accommodating to my requests/needs and always made sure that I was comfortable.. so yes, shout out to her-- haaaaayyy girl hayyyyy :D  As for the other nurses, you guys need to go back and really ask yourselves if you're in this field for the right reasons. It upsets/angers me that when I relive the moment of giving birth to my FIRST child, I remember what bitches I had to deal with on TOP of the pain I was going through. SHAME SHAME.. needless to say, my next child will not be delivered at Banner.   OH.. and also, when I got my epidural, my lovely anesthesiologist had to poke me TWICE bc she messed up the first time. Like um what? Are you trying to paralyze me?!?!

EW don't ever eat dim sum over here.  Food was not fresh at all! I wouldn't be surprised if they just microwave leftovers from the previous day and serve them all over again. Their shrimp balls tasted like poop balls.... okay, so maybe I'm over-exaggerating a little but you get the idea. It actually tasted like effing plastic... EWWWWWA.  I say, go right over to Phoenix Palace Buffet across the street and get yourself some edible dim sum. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER! :)

Came here this past weekend and it was super packed. It was a Saturday evening so I wasn't surprised. Wait was about 20 minutes? Not too bad.  I ordered the Pasta Carrabba which is fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms and peas, except I substituted the pees for broccoli. Everything tasted great and the mushrooms actually tasted like chicken to me LOL. Oh, and I also got myself a cosmo to sip on and my oh my was it strong. .. but who's complaining? It got the job done with just a few sips. Talk about a cheap date haaayyyyy :D   The only minor complaint I do have is our waiter never brought out more bread as I requested, until I reminded him a second time. It was pretty busy that night so no biggie.. and PLUS at that point, I was too tipsy to even really care!

This review is for the MAC Cosmetics counter in Nordstrom. Wow, let me start off by saying what a bunch of rude hookers. I came here thinking I was going to be in and out within a few mins considering I knew exactly what I wanted.. but instead, found myself standing by the register without even being acknowledged for about 15-20 mins (I KID YOU NOT!!!). Like really? I've worked in retail before and I am sorry but that is NOT acceptable customer service. These bitches were walking past by me as if I didn't exist. I finally went up to one of them who was chit chatting w/a customer and was like "um excuse me, but can I get some service please?" How sad is that? Do your freaken job beetches!!! I wanted to slap all of that cakey ass make-up off of each and everyone of them. UGHHHHH I'm getting heated just thinking about it.  I really wanted to just leave and take my service elsewhere but the second nearest MAC was all the way in Scottsdale and I really didn't feel like driving there during rush hour just to grab one item. What a damper to my shopping day *hmph.

Before I go forward with my review, I would like to state that when it comes to my eyebrows, I get very anal. Tell me why is it so damn hard to find someone who can tame these bushy babies to my liking?!? LOL  So my girlfriend actually referred me here because she is a regular and swears by the lady who does her brows. I was a little hesitant at first because I have the WORST luck when it comes to my eyebrows so I'm usually really picky with who I allow to work on them. Anywho, we come in and request for Helen. I explained to her how I wanted I wanted them done.. shape and whatnot. She does her thing and waaaaala, I LOVE THEM. I looked into the little mirror she handed me and was like haaaaayyyyy now :D    I was soo satisfied with her work the first time that I decided to come back when it was time for a touch-up, but this time, I came alone. I walk in and spotted Helen and she automatically recognizes me. I tell her I wanted my brows done just like last time. Not too thin, a little arched, and etc. She does her thang, hands me the little mirror in the end.... and I just about fell off my chair. WTF happened to my eyebrows????? Where do I even start.. first off, they weren't even the same shape. One was much thinner than the other one and ahhh they were just a hot mess! AND she had the nerves to tell me that my one of my eyebrows were naturally thicker than the other one hence the different shapes. Like really bitch? REALLY????? I was in panic mode because it was a Saturday evening, and I was really looking forward to having some hot ass eyebrows before heading out for the night. Idk about you, but when my eyebrows are on point, giiiirrrl I feel like a million bucks.. and yea, needless to say, they were NOT on point that night.   Overall, this place is a HIT or MISS for me. Am I willing to return to take that risk again? I think not.

Ok so first of all, this is my very first review and i just had to write about my experience here at happy nails.   My cousin and I came here to get a pedi the weekend of super bowl last year. Waiting wasn't bad at all considering there were only a few ladies there and I believe there were 3 nail techs working? Anywho, I had a lady name Christine working on my toes. She told me that she was just helping for the weekend bc she actually worked at a different location. She seemed really friendly. making small talk with me... though it was very hard to understand her bc she had a really thick accent.. but I just do what I always do, nod and smile.   As she was getting started on my toes, I noticed she was a bit rough. Ohhhkay..... a lot rough actually. It very unpleasant but I just sat there gripping onto my magazine and prayed that she would hurry up and just finish already. After she painted my toes, I told her that I wanted a flower design and I even pointed out the design to her on the sample board. She smiled and said 'ok' in which I started to feel a little relieved since my time there was almost coming to an end. I proceeded to look down to read my magazine for a while..  but as I made a quick glance at my toes I noticed that it did not look like the flower design that I had chosen. Instead, it started to look like the cardinals logo! WTF.  now why would you do that???? I quickly asked her what that was and indeed, she was attempting to draw a cardinal on my toe (not a good one either, btw). I told her that's not what I wanted but she still kept insisting that I get it bc it was super bowl wknd. I was thinking to myself.. "Look lady.. i'm sorry, I love my cardinals and all but I am not getting that on my toe okay?!" Gahhh.  She finally fixed it for me and put my original design of choice on and practically chased me out of the store. I  think she felt a little insulted that I did not show interest in the design she picked for me but come on now, really???? That obviously was not what i wanted so why would you go and do that? I am obviously paying for it so I should be able to get whatever I want on it. This ain't free woman!!!  OH, and also.. they did not accept tips in any other form other than cash, in which i did not have.. but needless to say, I didn't feel all that bad about it. And no, I will not be returning!

Came here to grab a quick smoothie before heading to the gym with my friend. I got the pineapple coconut smoothie (the only thing missing in it was some rum :p) which was delish and my friend got the mango flavored smooth in which she loved as well. Very clean inside which is def a big plus for me.   It's sort of hidden so unless you know about it or happen to notice the cute butterfly chairs out front while driving by, you can easily miss it. I plan on coming back to do lunch here next time since some of their salads did catch my eye!

The MOST horrible service ever in the bowling area. Got to our Lane and waited for one of the servers to come take our order. After about 20 mins of waiting and still no server, I had to get up and flag one over myself. She came over, took our order etc etc. After waiting an hour, yes an HOUR.. and not even our drinks had come out but yet seeing everyone else around us getting their food, I finally got up and asked her about our order in which she insisted that it would only take a few more minutes. Okay, understandable. Maybe they're a little backed up in the kitchen? Who knows.   Anyway, after about 15 more mins of waiting she comes over to our table and says "I'm sorry, but what did you guys order again?" Uhhh are you kidding me??? I proceeded to tell her and she tells me to just come with her to the register where she puts in my lane number and come to find out there is NO order even inputted into the system under that lane. I asked her if my order was even put in and she assured me that it was and that somebody else probably took my food by mistake. She told me that it would only take 10 mins at the most and everything should be out. At this point, you can imagine how irritated I already am but I go back to my table anyway and continue to wait. Finally, about 15-20 mins later, the food comes out. I ordered the blt Cobb salad and she looks at me and says, "oh, did you need silverware?" Why of course not. I was actually planning on eating my salad with my fingers. Like really????? Took her another 5 mins to bring over the silverware and by this time, I honestly lost my appetite.   I have never experienced such awful service before. For the amount of money I spent there today, I expected way more. That experience alone is enough to make me not return.     Btw, the garlic fries are disgusting! They came out practically soaked in oil and looking like they were 3 day old fries that they reheated in the microwave. No thanks!

I came here on a Saturday evening w one of my gfs. Got seated at a deserted corner table in the way back which was fine bc there was a bunch of obnoxious drunks acting a fool up front anyway so yes, seat me far away from those crazies please.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders which came out fairly quickly, btw. Just as I was about to take a sip, I noticed a nice and shiny strand of HAIR sticking out of it. Oh, how lovely. Proceeded to look around for our waitress for about 20 mins or so but she was nowhere to be found. Actually had to flag down some guy who was clearing out the table next to us and told him the dilemma. He then says "I believe you and everything but can you point it out to me bc I don't see it." Why of course I will. I'll also kindly floss your teeth with it, if you'd like. Like seriously? Ugh. He then goes back and finds our waitress, she asks if I want the bar to make me a new one but I declined. We dipped and went down to RA instead where service was much better, and no hair was found in my drink!   I definitely liked it better when this place used to be Canteen.
