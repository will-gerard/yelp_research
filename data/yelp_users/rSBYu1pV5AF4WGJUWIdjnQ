When you are looking for the best Philly in Phoenix, look no further; this is the place.  The sandwich almost melts in your mouth... holy cow! It was delicious.  The fries are just your standard run of the mill fries, or they would have gotten 5 stars.

I love this zoo. Big zoo, but can be finished in one day.  Doesn't have all the fluff that the San Diego zoo has. The safari is the best exhibit.

Dude, this place is seriously good. I had the Chronic on garlic bread; which is roast beef with cheese, green peppers and some other stuff. I'll be going back for 420 day and getting the $4.20 meal served on a frisbee.  AND... any place that serves Tang and Koolaid is getting 5 stars!

Best sushi place in Mesa... hands down. I've been to nearly all of them and this is the only one I will go back to. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu; however, I like the Vegas Roll and the Dragon Roll.  This is where I'm having my birthday party!

Go here, before you go to the big chain stores. The tools are half the price are decent in quality. I've had the same Tiger saw for six years!

This place is so much better than Subway. It has a nice college style atmosphere on the inside; with a pin ball machine and various arcade games. The subs are excellent and are relatively inexpensive. My favorite is the meatball and the super duper.

Like the stars say, "Meh. I've had better".  I had the Stromboli and it was burnt all the way through.  On of my kids had the cheese pizza and it was so thin that it too was burnt.  My other kids had the lasagna and it was good but not great.  I think the best part of this experience was the diet coke... at least I knew what I was getting. We tried to sit outside to eat, but were told we aren't allowed, because "he" hasn't opened it, yet.  The door to the outdoor seating was open and who is "he"?  Grrr... I probably won't be coming back

I usually go to the Coffee Rush in Gilbert/Mesa, so I was happy to find out that this location is right next to another business I frequent.   The owners are one of the best part of the Coffee Rush experience; however, I love grabbing a cup of coffee, sitting by the lake and watching the ducks/sunrise.   If you love European style coffee... then look no further!

Barro's pizza is really good. Once a month we take the kids there and let them run around in the game room, so we can have a nice conversation.  It's great.  Kids have fun, stay out of our hair and we don't have to pick up toys afterwards.

The food is great and the staff is friendly.  The only reason they didn't get a 5 star review is because of the small waiting area.  It can get really crammed; especially in the summer time, when noone wants to be outside.  I really can't recommend any one particular item, because you can't go wrong with anything you order.

This place is a straight up burger shop. No thrills, no gimmicks. If you love cheeseburgers, you need to come here. They make everything to order, so you can have just about any combination and you can add whatever condiments you want; as they have a full sized salad bar full of condiments.  Walking in, the place screams cheeseburger... not a place for vegans.

I didn't stay here, but went to a wedding reception instead.  I think the best part about this hotel is that it is really easy to find.  You get off the freeway and it's on the corner.  The catering staff was really cool; probably some of the coolest caterer's I've experienced.  The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was nice.  Usually I get really hot when there is a lot of dancing and loads of people all around, but the temperature was comfortable.  However, we've had some really nice weather here lately, so maybe it will be different in August.

I found my new favorite liquor store. I've been wanting to come here for a while, but I just never mad it out there. Well, I wanted a keg for my Super Bowl party and I gave this place a call. They not only had the cheapest keg around, but they also had the cheapest deposit too.  This will probably be the only place I go from now on when I'm hunting for a unique beer AND when I hit the bars. Oh yeah... there is a bar in the basement. Cool, huh?

I would give this place a 2 1/2 star rating.  They know alot about lawn mowers, but they are really expensive and are only focused on selling you stuff you don't need.  Shop around before coming here...

This place is awesome! Dr. Kessler and his staff do a phenomenal job. I just found this place recently and will continue to make the drive to Scottsdale for all my eye care needs. My only gripe is that the selection of frames is on the short end... but, I still found something I liked.

I've never been to NY, so I can't compare the pizza AND I'm a die hard Chicago pizza fan, so I am a little biased; however, if this is what NY Pizza tastes like, it's better than I thought. The pizza is crazy good and the calzones are even better.

This place is awesome! The wife and I went here on our date night. We arrived a little later than we were hoping (around 9pm), but the staff was still friendly and accommodating. We each had a salad. I had the Zuppa de Pesce and the wife had the Chicken Piccata.  We shared a little bit of each other's meal and I can't complain aout either. My dish was one of the best I've had at an American-Italian restaurant. My wife's meal was pretty spectacular, as well. The chicken was moist, juicy and full of flavor. My dish was full of seafood. Typically, you get like 4 pieces of shrimp, a couple oysters and maybe a couple of other proteins; but, this dish was full of big shrimp, scallops, mussles and clams. Everything was perfectly cooked!  After dinner, we decided to share a tiramisu. Once again, perfection. Great way to end a great evening.  I will definitely be coming back...

This a great stadium to take the kids. The team sucks, but at least you have a comfy place to watch a crappy team. Just like every stadium, the food, drinks, beer, souvenirs, etc... i overpriced. However, ticket prices are usually reasonable. I normally sit in the bleachers (where the all fun is) and it cost's me $10. I buy a big bottle of water and I'm set for the day.  The kids area in the upperdeck is legit. My 6 year old tends to get bored half way through the game (I don't blame him - refer to my earlier comment about the team), so I'll take him upstairs and let him go at it. Sometimes the team mascot, Dexter, is up there playing with the kids, which is a cool experience, too.   Fun fact: To cool Chase Field, they spend $2,000,000 on air conditioning. That's right $2 million!

Went on a Friday afternoon and had the "Natie Bomb".  This was THE BEST sandwich I have ever had!  My wife had pancakes; which were absolutely amazing, as well.  I almost ordered another one to go.  If you plan on going on a weekend morning, you're going to be waiting for about 45 minutes.  It's the best breakfast in town! I just wish I could give this place 6 stars...

Dude. It's Ikea. What can I say in a review, that isn't already common knowledge? The kids zone is great. You can drop your kids off for up to an hour; which, by the way, it takes more than an hour to find your way out of this confusing maze of stuff. That's really my only complaint. I don't typically do a lot of shopping here; I mostly drop the kids off and enjoy some time to myself.

This place is legit. If you aren't familiar with Oregano's, than you're wrong and you need to quickly make yourself familiar. The buttery flaky crust, the fresh ingredients and the atmosphere make for a great night out with the lady. I recommend the Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage pizza. It's got plenty of meat and cheese with just a hint of heat. One of my fav's...

Rio is really really good. I came here on a lunch break one sunny afternoon and this place might be my go-to lunch break place from now on. I had the barbacoa burrito. I can see why it's award winning and everyone loves; however, I felt it was a little too sweet for me. It was still a really good burrito, though. I especially like that they put some cheese on the top of the burrito and melted it.  The ambiance, the service and the food all make for an enjoyable lunch. Next time I'm trying the steak. It looked delicious!

So, I went back to try the steak. It was awesome! I also had a bite of the grilled chicken and it was incredible, as well. I have to go back and try the flan... rumor has it, it's award winning!  Great alternative to Chipotle!

I like going to this gym as opposed to the other LA Fitness's, because it's clean and everything is in working order.  The staff are friendly and the personal trainers are approachable.  I just wish the upstairs was bigger, so it could have more treadmills/ellipticals.

This place is a dump. If you need to get rid of some books, just donate them to Goodwill or a Veterans group, because you'll get more self satisfaction. I dropped off about 40 books today and they would only offer me $3. $3? Are you effing serious? Nope, no thank you. I'll drop them off at the VA.  If you're looking for older fictional books or records, this place has a pretty serious selection; however, if you're looking for something more present and/or relevant, look somewhere else. Hell, if you're looking for a 1990's version study guide for the SAT, then this is your place!  This place is so outdated, you can see the dust when you walk in...

My quest to find a coffee similar to what they serve in Europe has ended. I have become somewhat of a coffee snob after my trip to Europe. The brothers that own this place remember everyone's name and what they drink... and best of all the coffee tastes GOOD! Unlike your typical corporate brand coffee place. Love this place

I love this place! I just started using the WiFi, to finish some work without the kids bugging me. If I come here, I'm buying a drink anyways, but I've never had a problem getting another WiFi ticket if I run out of time. They have outlets like every 6-7 feet, so you can almost always find a seat close enough to plug in your computer.  The owners know you buy name and if there's a long line, by the time you reach the counter, your drink is waiting for you. Yeah... they remember what everyone orders. I feel welcomed and at home when I come here; which is way I go here so frickin often!

I have found my Dentist! The entire staff is incredible. The Dr. talks to in terms that you can understand and will take the time to explain things to you.  The office is a little hidden off the main road, so a sign would be helpful; however, if you know the area it shouldn't be a problem.

This is my favorite brewery in AZ.  The food is good (I had the SoCal Burrito w/ shrimp) and the beer is even better.  I love all the beer, but my favorite by far is the Devil's Ale.  They serve the beer in a pretty awesome looking glass, which you can buy, and the beer will be 1/2 off with the purchase of a glass. Olympia is the best waitress they have.  She is really knowledgeable about ALL beer and she's friendly.  Ask to be in her section if you go. After the brewery, there are tons of places and little shops to visit.  The San Tan Brewery is right in the heart of downtown Chandler.  There is a winery across the street you can probably tour.

This place is great! The ice cream is sweet, but not too sweet, creamy and delicious. Their ice cream is made from local ingredients and without preservatives. You can definitely taste the difference. By default, the ice cream is healthier... yeah... I'll keep telling myself that...

This is my favorite chain pizza joint.  The chicken bacon pizza is the best.  Go there on Thursday's, because that's when they run the specials.  I think it's better than frozen grocery store pizza... so, there!

My wife and I went here on our bi-weekly date night a few months ago. I da just gotten back from France and was still feeling good about my culinary experience.   I was a little hesitant at first to believe that an American place could match the flavors that I enjoyed, oh so much, while in Paris. However, Petite Maison far exceeded my expectations. I had the dry vac'd steak (I don't remember what it was called, but it was the special of the day) and it was "Holy Shit" good!   After dinner, we had some cheese and a glass of wine. The cheese was amazing. They had all sorts of choices to chose from. We had the sampler, so we were able to taste something like 6 different cheeses.  If you have $75+ and want to have a great meal with your significant other, go to Petite Maison. You WILL NOT be disappointed.    My only complaint was that my meal had to end...

Dude, this place is bomb. Another gem found on Yelp.  I had the Capostromi and the wife had the Bobbi. The bobbie tasted like Thanksgiving dinner. Juicy shredded turkey on a bed of heavenly stuffing and smothered with cranberry sauce. Primo, man... Primo.  I actually liked the Capostromi better. What made the sandwich was the cole slaw topping. Really put it together nicely.  My only complaint is, I wish there were more sandwich options.   I'll be going back... and SOON!

This place is absolutely terrible. The donuts aren't bad... I mean, hay, they're donuts. However, the staff are the worst. I think the general manager/store owner doesn't give a sh$^ about how the place is run. I don't think I've ever got what I ordered. Usually an ice coffee and 2 donuts. Not difficult to get right. What I usually get is an iced tea and different donuts then I asked for, or hot coffee and no donuts. I've probably had every combination of screw ups. I won't be coming back; I've discovered BoSa donuts and Coffee Rush, which are better and less expensive.

I also found this place through Living Social. It's a good thing I did, because I've been looking for a good cupcakery close to home. The decor is really warm and the owners are very friendly. My wife and I took our two kids here on a Friday night to enjoy some tasty cupcake goodness.   My favorite, by far, was the pancake cupcake with bacon sprinkled on top. I know, it sounds weird, but you definitely have to try it. My wife really loved the malt ball cupcake; which I also really enjoyed. My kids loved all of them, so no real review from them.   TopIt is in a popular part of Gilbert; right in the heart of the civic center area. So, if you're out and about enjoying a good dinner at one of the many restaurants walk on over to TopIt and finish off the night with a yummy cupcake!

This place was horrible. It's apparent that the five star reviews are from friends/family. I had a bacon cheeseburger and my wife had the chicken wrap something or another.   I ordered the burger medium. What I got was burnt on the outside and dark gray on the inside. This burger was so hot I had to wait 10 minutes just to eat it... And it was still nuclear hot. There is no way it got that hot, and stayed that hot, being cooked on the grill. I think it was microwaved. Hands down one of the worst burgers I've ever had.  My wife's chicken something or another wasn't much better. It was also nuclear hot. This poor chicken died just to be half eaten and the rest discarded. It was so dry that it had that stickiness to it. You know... When you bite down and it has that weird texture that makes your teeth stick together.   We also had the Mac and Cheese bites. They were ok. Nothing special.  It's really too bad about this place. We were really excited about having someplace good, and relevant, in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, we'll just have to wait a little longer for something else to come along.
