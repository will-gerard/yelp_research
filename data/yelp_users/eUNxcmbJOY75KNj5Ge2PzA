Today was my first visit to La Grande Orange, and it was wonderful. Seriously some of the best food to the most friendly and helpful staff. I had a great time, and forsee being this a usual dining spot now.

Best pizza! My absolute favorite. This is a family owned place!! Wish there were more, but I will drive to surprise in a heartbeat for this pizza.

What an absolute horrible dinning experience. Let me set the stage. My husband, 2 small children, and I sit down. We order drinks. An ice tea for my husband, 2 lemonades, and a coffee with cream for myself. Clarification again with the waitress yes, I would like cream with my coffee. She returns with an ice tea in plastic container with a lid for my 30 year old husband and 2 very tall GLASS glasses of lemonade of the 2 and 1 year old children. I then ask, "can we please have something with a lid". She replies with a little attitude and "ok but can I take ur food order first" as the kids squirm and whine for the delicious lemonade that sits before them. Finally we get the plastic ware after she takes our food order, checks on the table next to us and runs food from the kitchen for another table.   THEN when the food begins to arrive it comes out one plate at a time. 5 minutes apart. But of course forgetting the kids plate. The kids get to share one side of eggs as I regretfully ordered a spicey dish with jalepenos. Had to ask 3 different people for a side plate so my youngest didn't have to eat off the table.   Finally the waitress mumbles she didn't hear we wanted a quick breakfast with the eggs scrambled and piece by piece assembled the breakfast. Eggs, later some fruit, followed by 5 minutes later some bacon, and finally when we were finished with our meal out came the toast.   Never once did our waitress refill our water or coffee (that I had to ask 3x for creamer) and as we signed our card receipt she never once took a plate of food.  Absolutely horrible service!
