We waited about 30 minutes to be seated... no biggie... waited another 30 minutes for the food only to have the wrong order brought to us. So instead of waiting longer, we left without eating... Probably a good thing as I had ordered steak and eggs and caught a glimpse of what I think was their "steak." It resembled a Jack Link's kippered beef product in both size and texture... Oh, did I mention the B rating from the Dept. of Health... I feel a need to point out that the dynamic I observed with the employees indicates management issues and not necessarily an issue with the staff. My recommendation... stay away from this one.. far away.

Service is good.. Food is terrible. Low quality, bad preparation....  If the quality to price was more in line I would've given it a higher rating because I don't generally have high expectations for chains but in this case I just don't think the value is there.

First time... had the stacked enchiladas. Plenty of spicy goodness there. That being said, come hungry and ready to light your mouth up a bit for this one. How does it rate? Great NM style food. Excellent service. Typical ambiance. All in all, a winner in my book. Oh, and if you're a Tequila fan (I'm not... long story), they have well over 100 different types!

I give it 2 stars.....ONLY because the staff and service were good. You may rate it higher if you are fond of those frozen Healthy Choice bowls.
