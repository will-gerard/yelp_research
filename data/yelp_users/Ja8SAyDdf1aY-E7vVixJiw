Pretty nice setting, nice waitresses, *really* good food, and the price is right. I easily could have expected lunch to cost twice as much; $8 for a Chicken Curry plate for lunch, I'm sold.

One of my favorite places now. Simple menu but great food with some inventive twists. Mostly burgers, salads, biscuits (biscuit sandwiches), and sides (fries, slaw), few other things. Cool vibe. Mostly outdoor seating, never experienced this place in mid-summer, must be scorching--then again, it's only open at night when it's cooler.  Oh, and yeah, only open after 5pm (typically). I'm there now, surrounded by all college age kids as I type this. EDIT: I felt I must update and drop a star because 1) the outdoor furniture is extremely old and weathered, and not just rustic, and 2) there were quite a few ants on the narrow table/bench where I sat outside.  I can understand these things being "normal" for "normal" situation outdoors, but "normal" doesn't get 5-star ratings. They should get refurbished furniture and go crazy on insect control.

Very nice, but eerily gaudy and quiet. My most recent meal ("Evelyn's Favorite Pasta") was a bad choice, the pasta was undercooked and the combination was bland, I desperately wanted some tomato sauce or something. But it's Cheesecake Factory, the special favorite of many. Overall all the food is generally good, as is, of course, the cheesecake. Don't come without buying cheesecake, even if you don't have room for it; take a slice home with you. But to my original surprise the first time I came to one of these, Cheesecake Factory is about a dining experience with a very full menu of fine meals.

Oh my word .. these guys have, by far, the best sandwiches I have ever put into my mouth! Nothing beats a toasted turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and garlic sauce and a side of fries or pasta.  The atmosphere inside is only so-so. You feel like a foreigner here, your food is grouped by country flags, everyone on the other side of the counter (there seem to be at least five or six people) is Asian with non-native English skills, the walls are plain white, and the self-serve beverages are where the patrons' toilet should be.  But take me here on a comfortable day and let me sit outside at the umbrella-covered table with my cutting-board-as-a-plate as it holds my footlong toasted sandwich with its specialty sauces, and my side, and I am seriously in chillout mode for lunch.  I love eating here!!

The Banana Cream Pie Blizzard has been discontinued. That and the Coke Freeze were the only reasons why I ever came to Dairy Queen frequently. I don't know what they were thinking when throwing out the Banana Cream Pie flavor from the Blizzard flavors, but apparently about half of the previously large list of flavors has been eliminated and now you just have the basic Chocolate and Vanilla (so to speak). The closest thing they have now to what they had is a Banana Split flavor. Sorry, no, just throwing bananas and Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry ice cream in a blender is not something to be proud of as a replacement for the Banana Cream Pie. However this happened, this downsizing, whether for improving the budget or whatever it was, this downsizing of selection was a downgrade in service and in product, and I'm not likely to come back. There are other places where I can get chocolate or vanilla ice cream.

As one who came to this place several times a week, I was horrified to see this place shut down. This restaurant was the landlord's greatest asset (much more so than the lease), what a moron upping the lease price like they did, assuming that's what happened.  I'd love to learn of it if Anthony opens another restaurant in Scottsdale. I'd be there in a heartbeat. Great food!!   Meanwhile, does anyone have any recommendations for alternative restaurants for healthy food? I've been regularly going to Coffee Plantation, they have a delicious breakfast wrap, a great chicken waldorf salad sandwich, and some amazing lettuce/spinach salads. But if there are other healthy places to eat in this area of Scottsdale that are worth recommending, please share! I'm hungry!

I'm a fan of this place. They have some really good Mexican food here, and good service. My experience didn't blow me away but it was SOLID. The food tastes great and there are enough seats and privacy to be able to have conversations with colleagues. 4 1/2 stars but it rounds up to 5.

EDIT: THEY'RE CLOSED?!! I came to work out this morning. Recently bought out by LA Fitness, it appears that they shut their doors and cut the lights and didn't even notify their paying customer base.   -----------------  **** (4 stars)  I'm not convinced all of the other reviews here are reviewing the same location; I'm posting this for the location near Scottsdale Rd and Shea Blvd. This is NOT a dump. It's a very nice, clean facility. I have no earthly idea why anyone would call this place a dump; I mean if these people really were reviewing the same place, assuming they didn't overhaul the place before I joined, I can't imagine what these people would think of an actually dumpy gym, because I've been in some real rat hole gyms before.  This is a great place, I'm a very satisfied customer. Yes, as they are a business they WILL give you the long-winded tour, they WILL weigh you and, using condescending tones, convince you that you need a trainer, and they WILL try to shove protein up your nose (so to speak). This wasn't the first time I had experienced this; I had a similar experience at a 24-Hour Fitness in California. And to be quite honest, I almost wanted it .. I was able to just turn my brain off and wait for the hour or two to go by while they finished their sales pitch, I knew what they were doing, I knew I couldn't get around it, and at the same time I LOVED the idea that once this was all over with I could get access to a nice gym at only $20 a month.  Since I was in a financially uncertain future but knew I needed to get in shape no matter what, I pre-paid for one full year. They told me that because of this I get another six months free. Nice! That's 18 months for only like $240. The caveat is that after 12 months I'll get charged for another 12 months and I have to voluntarily ask them for a refund. They're a business, trying to take advantage of people's forgetfulness .. I can live with that, it's not like they were double-charging me. (Then again, what is this "maintenance fee" people speak of?)  While membership is cheap, they make up for it in training and supplements sales. I tried Mountainside a couple years prior, they were flabbergasted by my questions about getting a trainer. I was shocked that they were shocked and took my business elsewhere. I took advantage of a trainer at Pure Fitness for four sessions (beyond the first two free training sessions). Four sessions cost me nearly $300, which is more than my 12 mo prepaid membership. Do I feel ripped off?  A tiny bit, but then again I know they are a business and I came willing.  Their equipment is in decent (not great) condition; the cardio machines are hit-and-miss when it comes to successful heart rate detection. They have a lot of focused weight machines in the main area and a nice big area in back for free weights and pulleys. They do have classes but I don't take advantage of them. There are TVs in the main area, but they're old CRTs (not, say, plasmas) and they're all tuned to football, baseball, or golf, and not, say, Family Guy or some other non-sports channel, which I found disappointing as really don't get into sports.  Stay out of this place during "rush hour" fitness periods (around 6:00 PM). It is disgustingly stinky and humid, with the air filled with body sweat. I nearly choked on it one day. If there's one big thing to complain about regarding their facilities it's that they don't ventilate the place as much as I wish they would.  But overall I am quite satisfied with Pure Fitness.

My air conditioner had gone out at home and needed a place to sleep cool for the night. I *really* liked this place. For the price of a Motel 6, my two-bed room was furnished with a decent HDTV with HD cable (it's about time a hotel caught up to the 21st century!), and the walls and refurbishings looked and felt very new and well-kept. The air conditioner was managed by a dedicated wall thermostat and was nice and cool. I was also glad that they accept pets, I have two cats and I wanted to keep them cool, too. (I decided to leave them home, but it was a relief to know I had the option. I found this hotel looking for a pet-friendly hotel.)  My only complaint is that they really need to put a sign in front of the elevator that reads, "Please courteously keep other people sleeping in mind," and perhaps have a monitored security camera with a mic, and then ask people to quiet down if they are being disrespectful to those who are sleeping. I was in room 302 last night and was RUDELY awakened by MULTIPLE door slams and loud jabbering at 2:30 AM as a family or group made multiple trips unloading their car, repeatedly walking away from their door left wide open as it slammed shut and even shook the walls. There needs to be accountability for this sort of thing, and it is certainly the hotel's problem because if these are the kind of people the hotel is going to lure and the hotel wants it that way then STAY AWAY from this hotel.

Red Robin has the best burgers in America, at least as far as commonplace chains go. They have wraps, salads, and chicken sandwiches, too, but I've only had the burgers and they're awesome. I was sadly disappointed to find that they stopped serving the Santa Fe cheeseburger or whatever it was called, but the Guacamole Bacon cheeseburger is a nice alternative. The fries are plentiful (supposedly they are refillable for free? I dunno, I'm usually too stuffed with the burger to find out) but a bit too salty and greasy. The sodas are too watered down right off the bat, perhaps due to the ice. The waitresses are friendly (and very nice to look at) but going there alone I feel slightly rushed as they hand me my cheque as soon as I start on the fries.

Internet works now. Seating is adequate (a good thing). Service is fast and friendly. And my hummus+chicken+pita+veggies tray is the freshest I've had at any Starbucks.

Very good authentic Mexican food. I tend to judge authenticity and goodness of Mexican food by a) how much beans, rice, and cheese do they pile on, and b) if I ate nothing but beans and rice, would it be delicious? The answers here are a) plenty and b) yes! I bought a sampler with an enchilada and a taco. The taco was one of those homestyle kind, where they start with a soft tortilla and fry it into shape until it's crispy. The setting is only so-so, it's a narrow dining room with not a lot of variety of seating options. The price was quite reasonable, but not cheap, somewhere around less than $15 after drink and tip for the least expensive but filling sampler lunch on the menu.

Been here a couple times now, for a couple different cars. First one was a junker I chose to blow money here at Firestone on just to get a look-over. Little to nothing was actually done, but I did get an honest evaluation.   Next visit I needed a full diagnostic for a just purchased old (2004) used car, ended up with new tires, new brakes, flushed coolant, oil change, air filter. Got it all done in 5 hours (after a 2-hour wait in the morning being asked to come back later to drop the car off). Twice I said I also want the steering alignment checked, both times he said, "Yeah yeah, we'll do all that when we get all this other stuff done." By the time the car was ready, I asked if the steering alignment had been checked, they said  'no'. I initially said I'd wait for them to do it now asap, but then I changed my mind, I was tired, I'd been waiting for five hours.  I don't know about you, but when I come in and say "I also want this checked," that is an instruction, a command, not a nice-to-have. I have to take a star off for that. Otherwise I'd give these guys 5 stars. They even gave me a quarter when I was short on change for a beverage from the soda machine while spending four hours in the waiting room and an hour wandering around looking for a shopping mall that turned out to be shut down

Ordered delivery via Yelp. Arrived fast (thanks Yelp and whatever that courier service was). The food was plentiful and very delicious. Not the best in the world but definitely better than average. Will probably order again some month.

I'd rate 4 or 5 stars, but had a bad experience last night. I was anticipating eating an appetizer or something. The shrimp basket looked like just the right amount, but then I saw the price: nearly $20!! So I started mulling over smaller, simpler options. A waiter/staff approached me (I didn't have my service request light on) and asked me if I wanted some water or a soft drink, I was actually pretty thirsty as I'd just had a workout, so I said, "Water would be nice!" I wasn't going to buy anything yet, but I did want the extra time to consider my options, *with* some water in my body, first. He mumbled something and then said, "Let me know if you need anything else." The way he mumbled and the way he said that last bit, I sat there betting he wouldn't return with water, not without me actually ordering something.  Well that's not how it works, buddy, and that's why I'm here posting a negative review. You offered water. I didn't signal to request water. You took the initiative, you set my mouth on fire looking forward to water, you didn't bring it because you wanted a guaranteed tip. NO TIP FOR YOU. I genuinely would have considered ordering something if you had brought me my water first. And despite an eventual slight craving I abstained from giving you any patronage out of principle.  The setting and seats are very nice here and very clean. The online seat selection doesn't have proper proportions of screen; I was in a 3D movie and the screen wasn't nearly as wide as suggested. Not bad, though, just normal, and the sound levels were just right too. The 3D viewing wasn't super low FPS or whatever, so no headaches, good comfortable viewing. Extra star.

This review is several months late but this was my experience around March 2016. I guess you could say I've been so shocked by the experience that I couldn't get myself to write a review. I went in for some breakfast and coffee. After I got my food I asked where my coffee was. They handed me a styrofoam cup. I went to the beverage counter and found the coffee. It was cold. Literally, cold. I said, "This coffee is cold." The tall, dark-skinned woman who served me (I'm only describing as such for identification purposes, I'm not racist) said, "All we can do is put it in the microwave for you." I gave it to her to put it in the microwave. At this point I wasn't sure I was willing to drink it. I returned to the beverage counter to look for the cream and Splenda. I found several open containers for it all, but they were empty. "Where's the cream?" "We don't have any," she said as she rolled her eyes and handed me my microwaved coffee. I was floored. I ate my breakfast and threw the coffee away.

For those who love to wash their own cars, it just doesn't get much better than this. The place looks kind of aged but it seems to be very well maintained, I've had no problems, and the little cleaning supplies vending machine worked fine too (reasonably priced, too, no insane markup).  I am only taking off one star because while I love a clean car and will spend money for it, nothing floored me so much that I had to keep coming back. For the price, I can get unlimited automated wash plus fast and detailed detailing by careful human hands (not my own) by being a member/subscriber of a certain facility in N. Scottsdale on Via Linda. I realize automated machines run the risk of marking up the car with swirls and the like, but a wash plus unlimited detailing for less than the cost of going to Spirit Car Wash once a week was something I couldn't pass up.

I'm sorry, I have to update this review. The years have gone by and a bad experience still haunts me.  Some years back around the time I originally reviewed this place, I went in to get a smoothie and/or some protein. I was (still am) a pretty fat, out of shape dude, but I was trying to care about self-maintenance and the Pure Fitness gym across the lot had just closed down, and rumor at the time was that it had been bought out by L.A. Fitness. So here at One Stop Nutrition I tried to ask about that whole situation, and ask the guy what he thought about L.A. Fitness. I was comparing experiences from what was Pure Fitness with L.A. Fitness. But the guy at the counter said, "Look, I don't want to SOCIALIZE. Just get your stuff and leave." At the moment, I thought he was saying this in context, as in he didn't want to socialize at the gym. But that just doesn't make sense. *Get* your things at a gym?   I am still jaw-dropped amazed at how incredibly, horrifically rude people can be. I never went back. Not sure why I never updated this review, either; it was a glowing review this whole time. That guy's probably not working there anymore. But that hurt. It really hurt. Specifically it hurt my ability to believe in humankind.

Tonight I ordered another Fabulous Four, as carryout, as I always do. Got all the way home and opened up the box to find a cheese pizza. Now I'm back at Rosati's waiting another 30 min for them to start over and make what I ordered.

I would love this place, the waitress was very nice (in more than one way) and the food was delicious. But after feeding only myself for what I thought was one of the least expensive meals I walked out having spent about $25 including drink, dessert, and tip for only one person.

My mom and sister drove here from L.A. to visit me and I decided to take them to Applebees to treat them with an evening appetizer. This was at around 9:30pm about three weeks or so ago. We parked, we entered, we stood there for two or three minutes, we didn't even get a second glance from an employee, we walked out, we drove away, and we went to Chili's. That Chili's experience was well worth the Applebees exit!! Delicious!  I give Applebees one extra star because I ate at this particular Applebees twice before, and it was a decent experience.

This Mexican food is very simple, slightly bland, but fairly fresh. The chicken is chopped up into tofu-looking squares. But I was satisfied with the food, which was fairly healthy Mexican food as Mexican food goes. The staff is quite polite. I met some cool people hanging out there while I sat outside.

They don't know how to brew iced coffee here. It's worse than McDonald's when McDonald's came out with iced coffee and didn't know what "plain cream" was, only "vanilla". This DD brews the coffee super weak and adds (I think) two extra squirts of syrup (I think I heard five squirts where three were called for). The last time I came (about a couple weeks ago) they handed me a cup of clear-ish white liquid. I said, "There's no coffee in it." They took it back, threw it out, and poured me another saying they would give me the cream on the side, I said that's fine. They handed me a sealed cup full of what looked like iced tea. I'm not exaggerating, it looked at best like dark tea, I could see right through the whole cup. I got this through the drive-thru, but I immediately pulled over, got out, and threw the whole thing away in their bin.

The whole concept of going in and being treated like you're being served at a restaurant with a waiter, but you're in a "normal" movie theater but with a table that pulls up to you, was brand new to me and I loved it. Been here three times. Food is delicious, especially the fries, both the "plain" fries (which are spicy) and the sweet potato fries (which are really sweet potatoes and not just flavored). The screens are huge, too, with standard, strong sound, and the 3D theater uses RealD.  I do have a complaint and that is that their server request lights are not being kept up to proper maintenance. Mine was out once, and the theater is still relatively new, so I found that to be a bit ridiculous.

The only thing I didn't love about this place is that they closed while we were chillin. :P The #2 Hollywould's SF cheesteak or whatever it was called was phenomenal. Their famous "crunch bread" was incredible. I wish I lived nearby, I'd eat here all the time.

I am amused by the hilariously unclassy poster/sign they have on the right side of the building advertising beer with some stripper chick. But Taco Mich has the tastiest little tacos I've ever put in my mouth. I always order two fried pork tacos and two marinated pork tacos. They're tiny but wonderful.   They speak Spanish. Really, I'm pretty much the only white guy, they call out order numbers in Spanish, I had to Google for a translation so I didn't stand there sputtering like an idiot gringo.   Lots of bottled beers in the  customer-accessible fridge. Broad menu selection, too, they have burritos, chimichangas, and more. I also order rice and beans on the side, which tastes plain but not bland and still very good and not cheap or crap quality. Rice is a little dry. EDIT: The rice isn't so dry anymore, maybe they saw the review. ;)  I also order horchata. Delicious, if over-sugared. EDIT: The horchata's not so over-sugared anymore, maybe they saw the review. ;)  This is one of my favorite taco joints! Mas por favor!

For being microwave food, the food was absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, I can't maintain the subscription. I found out on Monday that I was going camping this weekend, but Freshly requires five and a half days lead time to cancel an order. $99 has already been charged (five and a half days ahead of delivery) and the delivery will end up in a box sitting at my unshaded front door in 115 F degrees Phoenix weather where it will sit for 24 hours until I get home Sunday afternoon. I wrote them yesterday (Monday) just a couple hours after my card was charged and their reply was basically, "Sorry, it's your fault. You had until Monday at 5PM PST to cancel." (My e-mail arrived five hours after that .. which is still nearly five and a half days ahead of delivery.) Yeah, "sorry", the food was good, but five and a half days lead time to skip (and no option for a Sunday delivery) is just too much, particularly when the distribution center/kitchen is HERE IN PHOENIX. Life happens and the whole point of subscribing was for convenience. Having my whole eating and home availability schedule locked down not only five and a half days in advance but the week to be fed as well is just not convenient. There are other local options in Phoenix with better prices, equal quality and equally healthy food, and a 24-48 hour cancellation policy.
