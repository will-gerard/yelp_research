Just had a great Manicure here from Jimmy (Budha), Yes there are two Jimmy's! I can't believe I didn't even know about this place, and I've worked a skip away for 9 months.    I told Jimmy I was a nail addict and have been pinning nail designs on Pinterst and he said to just bring a photo of what I want and he'll do it! That beats me trying to replicate the crazy designs on my own.    This is definitely my new go to spot for a lunch time mani!   QUICK TIP: If you are paying by credit card either bring cash for the tip or remember to tell him to add it before he runs your card.

This is a one stop shop for cake decorating and candy making supplies. This place reminds me of Home Depot.  There are many "shiny" things that can get you totally distracted from what you were going there for, but the staff is knowledgeable and helps make sure you get everything you need to complete your project.  There is no other place like it in the Phoenix area.  The product selection is more than triple that of any Michael's store and here the staff can actually give you recommendations rather than just directing you to the right aisle.  If you're a lover of cake decorating like I am, you will love this store!

I went in for a cleaning about 3 weeks ago. When I called to make an appointment, I asked how long it would take, since I was leaving the office. They told me 1-1.5 hours.   It all started off okay, the girl taking my X-rays yakked my ear off, which was a little annoying, but preferred over someone who doesn't say anything.  She had to move me into another room because the equipment was working, and then moved me back to the other room to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came in, looked at my X-rays, looked at my teeth and then explained that I needed a couple fillings replaced.  He was pretty brief, but thorough enough.  Next the hygienist was running behind, so I waited about 15 minutes in the lobby for her.  When she was ready, she took me into yet another room.  At this point I was a little annoyed with the musical chairs, and asked her how long she anticipated the cleaning would take.  She said it would "depend"!   Well that doesn't help me get back to work on time.  The cleaning was okay, it was little uncomfortable when she was scraping, but then my whole mouth was very sore for days.  When I went to check out and pick up my estimate for the fillings, I noticed immediately that he pricing was wrong. The office manager proceeded to patronize me and tell me that I was misinformed and the pricing was right.  Finally, since I had already been in the office for over 2 hours, I just asked her to verify the pricing with the insurance.  She said she would call and then call me later that afternoon.  I've still never received a follow-up from her.  I did however receive an estimate from my insurance in the mail yesterday... and sure enough I was right. She was almost $500 off (not in my favor).  I'm guessing that when she found out she was wrong, she decided she was going to let the insurance company notify me.  Unfortunately, the doctor was fine, but when you spend 90% of the time at the dentist with his support staff, you have to rate the office as a whole.  Sorry Dr. Smith, you just lost a patient!

I only live about 15 minutes from the airport, so typically a cab is the easiest way to get home without hassling someone to pick me up.   I got into the cab and saw a credit card machine which was good because I only had $24 on me.   I told this to the cab driver and he got onto the freeway informed me that the machine doesn't always work, but  if it doesn't I'll take you to the closest ATM.... As a girl, it's not the most comfortable situation, getting cash while a cab driver is waiting in the car... with your belongings!  Unfortunately the cab fare was $28 and the machine wasn't working... so there I was at the ATM.  It ended up not being the most convenient options since it added about 15 minutes onto my trip and the $2.50 ATM fee.   The driver was nice, the cab was clean, but don't advertise that you take CC and not have the machine work!

With a "moo-moo" here and a "moo-moo" there... Everywhere a "moo-moo"!  Sorry that was the first thing that came to mind when I was  asked to go to the farm for lunch.   As first timers , we were a little confused on where we suppose to start, but there was a long line of people, with no food, holding menu's... so we started there. As a vegetarian I was pleasantly surprised with the variety in their menu.  In fact I changed my mind five times before we got up to order.  I ended up with a 1/2 Farm Fresh Veggie sandwich, a cup of bean soup and finished up with butternut squash creme brulee. The food was excellent, in fact I had to restrain from licking my soup bowl clean.  The only downside is it took forever to come out, and to top it off, I had to get a redo on my sandwich because they smothered it in Mayo (Which I do not eat, EVER!).  Despite the semi-chaotic service and delivery, it's hard to complain about getting a great meal, and enjoying in such a beautiful setting. The tables are set up along side the farm, and surrounded by huge trees.  I am really looking forward to coming back and giving their breakfast a shot!

The 5.5 mile hike up South Mountain is a great, if you can manage the mirage of getting to the top (or read the mile markers).   As you go up, you keep thinking you are just about there, then you turn a corner and wind all the way back around.   It really is a nice hike, (just don't forget you need to get back down!) and once you get to the top you have a great view of the city and downtown.  There is a good amount of parking at the base of the mountain, but beware there are no trash cans, dog disposal bags or water along the hike.  Also, the road is open to cars most of the time, so be careful.

It's pretty exciting when you go into a sub shop and they offer vegetarian cheese "steak" sandwich.   I've never had a cheese steak sandwich, so as I was driving back to the office, with my sandwich in tow, I kept peeking in the bag thinking, "Is this real?" Yes It was, and it was fantastic!  I was expecting a greasy cheesy mess, but that wasn't the case at all. The "meat" and peppers were perfectly cooked to order and topped with real cheese, not cheese whiz. I had them add mushrooms, which was a solid choice, well worth the extra buck.  The bread was very soft inside with a little crunch to crust, similar to Italian bread.  Needless to say, I enjoyed every bite of my $10 sandwich.  The best part may have been seeing my co-workers jaws drop at the sight of me eating "meat".

I looooove Jason's Deli.  I would have to say it's one of the best Deli's I have ever been to.... Ever!  I order from there all the time and never get sick of it. They have a huge menu, which typically will make me leery of a place, because really, who can perfect that many items?.... Jason's!  All their food is made fresh to order, and they will modify anything on the menu to meet your needs.  Their online ordering system is easy to use and allows you to save your favorite orders.   They also have a great salad bar and their soups are fantastic.  My favorite is their vegetarian French onion soup, served in a bowl with boiling hot provolone cheese,  yum!  You will leave stuffed to the max or with leftovers, but don't forget to grab a complimentary ice cream cone on your way out.

Okay, so not exactly authentic, but just as good as Chang's in my opinion.   I would recommend Pei Wei if you are in the mood for Chinese and want to get something consistent.  They make their food to order, but it pretty much always tastes the same.  It's like a fast food version of P.F Chang's and cheaper.   My favorite is the Mongolian with Tofu and Veggies.  If you are ordering takeout, I would recommend calling ahead at least 25 minutes before you want to pick it up.  I have called and been told 30-45 minutes until my order was ready, because it was lunch time or behind a huge order.

Let me start by saying, as a vegetarian Flemings is not the most exciting dining selection, but I decided to give it a try for the sake of my BF and he's carnivorous appetite.   As good guests do, we called ahead and made reservations.   When we arrived the hostess did not greet us, we had to let her know we were there and who we were, as she was too busy burying her face into the computer screen.   Never looking up at us, she looked at the screen for a bit, waited for another hostess to walk up and then handed her our menus and table location.  It was the oddest thing, she never made eye contact nor did she wish a pleasant dining experience.   We both walked away thinking Wtf?  After the initial awkwardness from the hostess, we were sat by a pleasant hostess and greeted by our server.  The service overall was very attentive, but that was about as good as it got.  Our server had very little knowledge of the menu, wine list or what items on the menu were vegetarian.  A previous reviewer had mentioned a fantastic vegetarian platter offered to them that was not on the. She knew of no such thing, nor did she offer to check with the chef.  She just recommended I get a double order of the mushroom ravioli appetizer, or a bunch of side dishes.  Boo!   I started with one of their specialty drinks, a combination of prosecco and elder flower liquor, it was very tasty!  I ordered a Caesar salad with ranch on the side to start, it of course came out with the ranch tossed into the salad.  For dinner I ordered the double order of ravioli, BF ordered their large filet,  and we shared a side of mushrooms and their Flemings potatoes.   Overall my ravioli were very tasty but I could tell the sauce was pretty much just melted butter... so how can you go wrong!  My BF's steak came out at a solid medium, not the Medium Rare he requested. In addition, it had this weird separation of the meat by some sort of tendon or fat that I have never seen in a filet.  For a steakhouse that was very disappointing.       Overall, the meal was okay and the service was okay.  If it was a $100 meal I would have given it a 3 stars, but for $200 I expect a lot more in terms of service. Sorry Flemings, we will not be back.

It took a little convincing, but Hottie and I decided to give Flemings a second shot.  Let me just say, it was like we dined at a totally difference restaurant!  We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess, who offered us our choice of table (despite the fact that the place was just about at capacity).   To start us off, our server recommended a new specialty cocktail with vodka, fruit juice and Prosseco which was less than 99 calories.   It was delicious! She also recommended a couple Pino Noir options for Hottie, who was very pleased.  I started off with the Flemings salad.  Really nothing special, actually the dressing was rather bland and it was served over romaine.  It really should have been served over spring mix or arugula... and adding a little cheese never hurts!  Regardless, I was perfectly happy with the complimentary warm bread and infused butter spreads to start me off.  For dinner the server recommended a "super secret" menu item for vegetarians.    I'm not sure what it was called, but it had layers of spinach, portabella, asparagus and roasted red pepper served over a very tasty red cream sauce .  On the side, I ordered the chipotle mac-n-cheese, YUM!  I don't even want to imagine the number of calories that were stuffed into that plate of cheesy goodness!  My Hottie ordered their special, a filet bone-in cooked medium rare with Flemings potatoes on the side.  This time his steak came out cooked perfectly, in fact by the end he was eating it off the bone... gross! For desert we had the chocolate lava cake.  I was a little leery, because typically these are served very small and obviously just reheated in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Not the case here.   It was the size of a softball, and just heavenly... warm chocolate oozing out of center, topped with ice cream and some kind of pistachio cookie... mmmm, still licking my lips! Okay, Flemings... Now I'm a FAN!

Yes!  It's twice as pricey as Gold's or LA Fitness... but it's twice as awesome!  You get what you pay for at Lifetime.  As someone who goes to the gym over my lunch break, I couldn't ask for anything more from a gym.  It's the little things; you don't need to bring a towel, soap, a locker key or lunch!  The café has a nice selection of healthy meals for breakfast, lunch, kids and even smoothies and the nutrition facts are on the menu.   As a vegetarian, there are several options for me to choose from.   The equipment from the cardio machines to the pool is well maintained and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  After being spoiled with Lifetime for over 3 years, I honestly could never switch gyms, call me a snob ... I don't care!

LifeCafe is a great perk to being a lifetime member.  The food is fresh, healthy and prepared relatively quick.  Life Café offers a nice variety of menu options from smoothies, breakfast, snacks, lunch/dinner to small kid's plates and vegetarian options. All the nutrition facts are listed for each item on the menu.   Another bonus is they have specials everyday:  $2 - Snack $3 - Breakfast (Huevos wrap is my favorite) $4- smoothie  $5 - Meal (Mostly sandwiches and wraps) In addition to food, they sell all the gym supplies you may have forgotten to put in your bag...socks, swim caps, weight gloves, tennis balls, etc... and free wireless access.   I'm not sure if you can get into the café if you're not a gym member, as it is passed the check-in point.

I have been going to the RWB in Mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.  As a vegetarian I have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but I typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. The eggplant Florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  That is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.   I would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. The only thing I will say is that I know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold... so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.  If you are area, I would definitely recommend RWB.

I'm sorry Bravo Bistro, I wanted to soooo badly to like your restaurant.  Let's start by saying if you put on your website... "Ask your server about our Happy Hour", then you probably should let your servers know.  Our server brought us the wine list (All bottles north of $40) and didn't mention or offer wines by the glass.  When I asked him about Happy hour, his response " it's only until 7 (which it was 6:20PM) and if you order one minute past I will charge you full price, but you can sit at the bar and get HH all night", then took the wine list and walked away.  So you don't want us to sit at your table? We stayed at the table and ordered our wines by the glass like the second class citizens that we were (at least that's how we were treated), some bruchetta and an order of garlic bread for the meal.  They brought us a complimentary plate of hummus which was good but on the salty side, as was everything we were served.  When it came time to order, I asked about vegetarian options, he said they could do any combination of pastas and sauce primavera style.  I ordered penne with spicy marinara primavera.  It came out with less than a cup of pasta and no veggies.  When the server finally came by to check on our meals, (which I hadn't tried) I told him I didn't get any veggies... he looked annoyed and took it back to the kitchen.   I'm sorry, but I was not too thrilled about paying $15 for a cup of pasta with no veggies, no salad and no bread. When my food came back the portion size had slightly increased. It was good, but nothing special, and there was NO spice whatsoever.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan and said it was a little salty, which I've never heard him say in two years... because he over salts everything.  Overall, the menu was limited, the service was uninviting and it was overpriced for the quality and atmosphere.  We will not be back.

This place is just fantastic.  I went there with my Boyfriend and some out-of-towners for dinner.   We sat outside and the patio was just perfect.  The service was good and the pizza was amazing.  I had the Roma pizza ... minus of the anchovies of course.  The mozzarella was fresh and the dough and sauce were freshly made.   They also have a nice selection of wines and the server was very knowledgably about suggesting parings.   The dessert, well let me say I am still drooling! I had the Dolce Della Casa, essentially it was a calzone filled with homemade Nutella and topped with Bananas, Carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream.   I have recommended Grazie to several people and all have thanked me afterwards!

Now this place is interesting... especially if you're a pirate!  I went to Giligins as part of a Happy Hour pub crawl, and was not quite sure what to expect.  Well, the drinks were cheap and they had great food specials, but I was afraid to try anything... so I didn't.  It's quite the dive bar that's for sure.  I think it would probably be a better time if weren't the only ones in the bar.  I have no complaints about Giligins in general, I just didn't like it.  It wasn't what you would expect to find in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.    I would only recommend going to Giligins if you have some time to kill in between some better places.  Feel free to call me a snob, but I'm not a big fan of dive bars in general... so if you are, give it try.

I am so glad Yelp introduced me to this local gem! Living right around the corner, I had no idea that this date shop was also a distributor of AZ wine and other local products.  After attending an event at Sphinx Date Farm, I stopped by recently to pick up some holiday gifts and was just as excited as I was at the event.  They have a great selection of AZ wine, and their salted dark chocolate dipped dates are so tasty, and a great stocking stuffer for our local foodie.  I've also fell in love with a spicy honey mustard they sell, so that alone will keep me coming back.  On my last visit, I treated myself to one of their pecan date cookies, and loved it. I will be searching pinerest for a similar recipe.

I love me some Sunflower on Wednesdays!  Sunflower has double ad days on Wednesdays, which means you get :  specials prices for the week prior + the current week = Mucho savings!  To sum it up, if you shop at Sunflwer, you'll get:   - Great prices on seasonal produce - Huge selection of Vegetarian, Vegan and Gluten free products - Decent selection of fresh meat, fish and cheese - Huge olive bar - Yummy homemade soups daily! - High priced staple items (Such as laundry soap, milk, etc...) Just keep this in mind.   Unless you're loaded or super green, this is not a one-stop-shop!  Awww, I feel healthier just thinking about it!

Hellz ya! I'm a fan.  Hottie and I decided to try out the Comedy Spot on Friday.  We love going to the Improv, but try to avoid Tempe as much as possible. Entry is half the price of the Improv, so I expecting the comics to be half as funny... I was wrong! We were sat in the front row, so of course we got picked on, but I don't think I've laughed that hard in a really long time.  It was a blast.   A couple things to keep in mind:  1.  The place is really small, so buy your tickets in advance or get there a little early.  2. Food is limited to a couple of "stadium" style appetizers, so eat first.   3. Two drink minimum, but the prices were pretty reasonable, I think our tab with tip came to $27.   4. Enjoy the comics and don't be afraid to laugh at yourself!

This review is for Great Arizona Picnic event of the Scottsdale Culinary Festival ... I want to key in on the word "Picnic".   A lot of reviewers have complained about the food not be of culinary excellence, which is correct, but the selections are decent for a picnic.  There is broad range of mediocre, decent priced food from local restaurants, such as BBQ, taco stands, gelato, sushi, and even Indian Food.  Despite what some of the reviewer's state, there are several events throughout the week that are tailored towards the Foodies.   These events do cost more than $10 for admission, as do most extraordinary culinary events.   Now back to the picnic, it's a blast!  It's a perfect way to enjoy the spring while day drinking.   This year, they went away with tickets and instead you put money on the GAP card, and pay vendors with the card.   I believe the reason there is a no cash policy, is because a portion of the proceeds go to non-profit organizations. We spent a good amount of time in the beer garden.  On Sunday the price of admission into the garden was cut down to $10, and then each beer sample (4oz) is $1.  With a selection of over 200 beers, it was a great way to try all different kinds of beer from local breweries and vendors.  The rest of our day was spent lounging on the main picnic lawn enjoying the bands playing on the main stage.  To sum it up: Go to the AZ picnic if you want to hang out in the sun and enjoy some tasty beverages and mediocre food... Don't go to the picnic if you have less than $40 in your pocket, and expect to be delivered a culinary masterpiece.

I've been waiting to review my neighborhood Starbucks until I could at least give it a 1 star, since zero is not an option.  They get one star for firing the unpleasant barista that made my Saturday morning visits miserable.  It is inevitable that every time I go to this Starbucks, I either get terrible service, or I get good service and they mess up my order.  This is not the place where "everybody knows your name", because they don't ask!  Wasn't that the premise of Starbucks when they first opened? Everyone's name was on their cup?  I want my name on my cup!!!! Despite my complaining, I continue to go back, every week... Why? Because I'm a sucka!

So... the first time I went to Kazimierz, was a blind date and I swore he was taking me into the back alley to murder me, but I was pleasantly surprised when behind the door was a little wine cave.  The date was a flop, but at least I found my new favorite wine bar!   I have been back a several times since and always have a good experience. The wine selection is grand and the servers are knowledgeable and helpful.  I recommend trying the flights, the wine is all higher end (yet affordable), so you're going to spend a bit of money anyway, why not try a few! For food, I have tried the fondue and some flat breads (There's not much more on the menu).   It was all excellent, but don't go expecting a big dinner, you'll be disappointed.  Kazimierz is a great place to catch up with friends or take a date, it's cozy, unique, and provides a nice atmosphere for conversation.

Boo.... I was super excited to try this place because it is near my house and it got good reviews, but was unfortunately disappointed.   First off, they need to update their website, they do not have delivery. I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and my boyfriend ordered a red chili burrito and chicken taco.   We both had the red sauce and it was burnt... so bad that I had to scrape it off to even have a few bites, then I gave up.  His burrito tasted burnt too, which meant it was the sauce not the entrée itself.   Their beans were pretty dry and nothing to get excited about.   BF did like the chicken taco, he said the shell was crispy but not greasy. Their chips and salsa were good, spicy but good.    Overall, I had a bad experience because the only thing I ordered was burnt, I think I would try it one more time, but next time in the restaurant, that way if it is bad, I can get my money back!

Solid no-cage grooming location in Old Town.  I brought my miniature poodles in for a grooming, and was pleasantly greeted by the groomer and about a dozen dogs.  My dogs are extremely social, so I like that they got to play a little in between their clippings. Most importantly, Guinness and Stella looked fantastic when I picked them up! My only gripe is that they charged me $5 more per dog than any other groomer in the area. Regardless of the price, I'll still go back.

We've been going here now for over a year, and the poodles love it.  As soon as we pull up to the building they get very excited, so I know that they are treated well  inside.  Something to note, they don't take credit cards, so you'll need to have cash on hand when you pick up the pups.

A Vegetarian delight!  A friend of mine turned me on to the Malee's Thai cooking class, and I decided to give it a try this weekend.  I am so glad I did.  The class itself was very informative, and really opened my eyes to the huge selection of vegetarian options at Malee's.  Most importantly they gave me information on how to cook my own Thai vegetarian cuisine, and the best places in town to find the ingredients. During the class they take you through about 5 recipes, and then provide sampling for the dishes as you go.   After the class you sit down for a full meal of the items presented in the class, along with wine pairing.  It was such a great experience, because I was able to try several dishes at once.  Most of these dishes I would probably never order, because I would assume they were not vegetarian. I was particularly taken back by the peanut curry, it was amazing!  If you dine at Malee's, keep in mind that just about everything on the menu can be made gluten free or vegetarian, just ask.  Finally, I would highly recommend the cooking class, you leave with a good understanding of the basics of Thai cooking, a goodie bag, and a full stomach!

It took me a while to venture into HoR, because honestly I didn't know what it was.  A friend told me that he gets the frozen Ahi from there, and it's some of the best he's had.  When I finally made it in, I was really surprised on how much they were able to put in that little store!  The south side of the store carries mostly canned/dry and frozen ingredients.  They do have a small selection of fresh items, like ginger, lemongrass, tofu etc...  There is an excellent selection of Curry's, stir-Fry sauces, and seasonings as well.  The rice is extremely reasonable, and there is a nice variety of types and sizes.   The North side of the store carries an eclectic mix of dinnerware, and cooking utensils.   HoR is definitely not a "One-stop-shop", but it's create  place t get some quality ethnic ingredients without the high mark-up you would find at the grocery store... if you could find it at there!

Every once in a while you just need some good Indian food to spice things up... on those days we always go to Jewel of Crown.  When you walk in you get hit hard by the lovely aromas of Indian spices... reminds you why you came!  We've probably been there 5-6 times this year and it has never been busy. It's kind of sad actually. They have a nice vegetarian selection; my favorite is Malai Kofta... which is veggie meatballs in Masala sauce!  I have also tried Saag Paneer and Bharta Makhni which were also excellent.  My Bf is also in love with the Chicken Masala... and Raita.   We typically order our food with medium spice because we like a bit of kick to the palate!  If you aren't used to Indian or spicy food, I would order medium-mild so you can enjoy the flavors before you decide to kick it up a notch.   Please give Jewel of Crown a try, it's my favorite Indian restaurant and I'm afraid it will go under if business doesn't pick up.... Oh yeah, and you'll enjoy it!

Oh boy... not a fan at all.  Tottie's is right by my house, so I checked the reviews and it appeared to be a good take out spot.  I ordered a Thai noodle dish with Tofu and my Bf ordered Pad Thai. I ordered both medium spice level.  My Bf picked it up and he said the place spelled rancid, not a good sign.   Both of our meals were terrible, had no sauce whatsoever and mine was so spicy it was inedible.  I love spicy food, so it's not that I can't tolerate the heat... this was just bad.  I threw out my meal and ate popcorn for dinner.

After my brutally disappointing first Tottie's experience, I was convinced to give it another try.   My boyfriend had been raving about the green curry he tried while I was out of town. Even though I am normally a red curry fan, I decided to give it a try.  It was excellent!  There was a perfect amount of heat, coconut, veggies and tons of extra sauce! My only complaint is they gave us huge entree portions but a tiny little container of rice for use to share.  We've only dined take out, but when I picked it up, I was surprised that the dining room was nice and large despite its look from the curb.   I will be back!

I've been to Carlsbad 5 times now and had a good experience every time.  I wouldn't say the food is fabulous, but decent enough to keep me coming back.   We recently moved into the neighborhood and have found that it's a great Happy hour spot ... and we can walk there!  They don't have a huge vegetarian menu, but they make their food to order, so I found that I can pretty much modify anything on the menu to take out the meat.  The chips and salsa duo is a must have, and its only $2 during happy hour!

So the last couple times I've been to Carlsbad I've been disappointed.  This place has really lost its luster.  The salsa now tastes like it comes straight from a can and there was such a huge layer of grease on my food that I couldn't figure out where my enchiladas stopped and the beans started.  Last night I went there with my mom and Grandma and the waitress was a huge snob, we didn't even want to tip her (of course we did).  It was so dark in the dining room that my grandma couldn't see the menu so she asked if they had a shredded beef burro. The waitress, in a condescending voice says, "Yes, of course we do, what you want is a green chili burro".   Gma then asked if that was spicy and she said, "Not really".  It came out so spicy that she couldn't even eat it.  The waitress did not offer to make her something else or take if off the bill, she was sooooo rude the entire meal, I won't even write about all the instances.  Her name was Michelle, so if you go there and she's your server you may as well get up and leave.   I really want to like Carlsbad, its within walking distance from my house and has a good concept... I just don't know if I can go back after my experience last night.

I've been to RA about a dozen times and I can't believe I have never written a review!  The best thing about RA (and only reason to go in my opinion) is their Happy hour.  From 3-7, just about all their appetizers and a good portion of their sushi is  1/2 price.  Now being a vegetarian, it's hard to get excited about a veggie roll, but they also have some great appetizers:  pineapple cream cheese wontons, veggie tempura, and my favorite which is their Dengaku Tofu.  It's a huge tray of tofu which is prepared  a little crispy and is drizzled with a sweet and tangy sauce that I just love.   Their drink specials are also a steal... I tend to go with either $2 hot sake, a $5 cosmo, or some combination of the two when I'm feeling frisky!

Unfortunately, I have to say I was disappointed in Grimaldi's =(.  Let's start off by talking about the food.   The menu is limited to only pizza and salad, so we got both and they were just average.   They have no "signature" pizzas, it's all build your own.   The topping selection was very limited, so we ordered a large pizza  1/2 with pesto and kalamata olives, and  1/2 with ham and pepperoni.   They charge you for toppings on the whole pizza even if you only get them on half which is a little ridiculous, but whatever.  I ordered a side of red sauce to dip my pesto pizza in.  It was watery and flavorless, it needed garlic and salt! The only thing I can say good about the pizza is they use fresh mozzarella, so it wasn't greasy.   The house red wine was decent and a good price by the carafe, overall they had a nice wine selection.   Our server was friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere was cozy.  We had a big party so we had a private room.  Needless to say, after spending $65 for mediocre pizza, wine and salad, this is not a venue we will choose to go back to.  If you want a great place to go for pizza and wine in Old Town, skip Grimaldi's and go to Grazie, you won't be disappointed!

Hit up Papago brewery yesterday after a softball game... I had heard of it, but had no idea where it was.  Turns out it was about a mile from my place... score!  Small place, great for a beer. They have a huge selection of tap beers, like beyond imaginable.  The orange blossom is my new favorite... yum!   They also have a wall cooler (Similar to those is a convenience store) full of bottled beers and beverages. The team ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and really enjoyed it, I didn't try any because it had meat, but wished I had ordered a veggie pizza after I saw it come out.  The inside kind of reminds me of a coffee shop, just a bunch of tables and a shelf of board games, nothing special but I didn't feel out of place or uncomfortable showing up in my game gear... but at the same time, didn't feel like I was in a dirty dive bar.   I'll definitely be back... and going to order some pizza next time forshizzle!

Finally a good nail spot in OT!  After stopping at several nail salons last Saturday that were closed, packed or too shady to step foot in, we used our Yelp apps and navigated our way to Gel-O! Thank you fellow yelpers for this recommendation!  From the outside this place appears to be a typical strip mall nail salon, but one you walk in it has a slightly classier feel to it.  We were greeted immediately and given an estimated wait.  As I was deciding on a color I noticed something that (shouldn't but) really impressed me.  They don't appear to be watering down their colors, what a treat!  In addition, they had a good selection of modern colors with bottles that were pretty full.  Lately I've noticed that a lot of the nail salons dilute the polish as it is used to make it last longer for them... but as a result it either never dries or flakes off way too quickly. I was also very pleased to see the lady sanitize every single thing she used for the pedicure, including the basket that she stored the tools in, A++! The prices are about $5 more than the typically strip mall salon, but it was well worth it. I had a 4 star spa quality pedicure for half the price. I swear she massaged my feet and legs for about 30 minutes, I was in heaven! I'll definitely be back.

The order started off rough, but ended up taking a turn for the better.  When I called to order food for delivery, it was obvious that they were busy. I was put on hold several times and it actually took over 10 minutes to place the order. I wasn't sure how to take this. Are they so busy because the food is great? Or, are they going to screw up or lose my order because they are so busy?  The food arrived about 20 minutes after they said it would but it was still hot, made correctly and very good. I wouldn't say it's the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's a solid 4 for takeout, price and portion size. They also through in some crab puffs, which my Bf said were very good.  I'll give them a pass for the service and delivery, because I could tell they were really busy. I hope the next time we order we get a little better experience on the service side.

Great selection of brews and a huge location! They don't take reservations but they do accommodate large parties with minimal wait.   Not only is the location huge, so are the portions... I had no idea. We started with an order of spicy Thai hummus with pita bread.  It was pretty tasty, the bread was soft and fresh and the hummus had a nice kick.  Other appetizers at the table where the spinach and artichoke dip, and the giant nachos.... Every appetizer was plenty for 3 to 4 people to share.    For my entrée I went with the vegetable beer bread sandwich and fries.  The sandwich was okay, the bread was very thin and made into a wrap which I thought was interesting, but it got soggy fast so I ended up not eating the bread and just eating the vegetables out of the inside.  The fries on the other hand, beer battered and crispy...just the way I like them.   I saw some pizzas floating around the restaurant too, next time I think that's definitely what I'm going to go for they looked amazing.    Overall this was a fun place, great service, decent (and very affordable) bar food and cool atmosphere for dinner.

As an Arizona native, I have been going to the Improv for years.  I'm sorry to say that although it showcases some big names, the talent and atmosphere has really gone downhill.   Despite the increase in comedy theatres in the East Valley, the Improv has not decreased their prices or upgraded the experience.  I can go to three other comedy clubs in the area for $5-10 cheaper, and LMAO... which is the point!  The last show I went to, I spent premium pricing to see David Spade, and I have to say it was joke. The show started about 30 minutes late and he appeared to be pretty intoxicated.   It wasn't funny at all.  After that debacle, I held off on the Improv for a while and just hit up the other comedy clubs when I needed a laugh.  We decided to give the Improv another shot on Friday, because we really wanted to see Michael McDonald.  I have nothing bad to say about any of the acts, unfortunately I couldn't enjoy them because I was trying to make my way through the worst Martini I've ever had... (cucumber). On top of it being awful, it was $12 (Of course there was no pricing listed). What a rip-off!  The terrible Martini was not the worst of it, we were forced to share a table with another couple... okay not so bad, except they had us all packed in like sardines. The whole set up was ridiculous.  No one's chairs were actually facing the stage. I had so much back pain from having to twist around to see the comics,( because there was not enough room to move my chair) that I just wanted the show to end so I could leave.  To make matters worse, when we did leave, we realized that a large number of tables were actually left empty... so I went through all that discomfort for nothing!  Big Boo for the Improv.... Save your money and go somewhere else!

As a vegetarian for almost 20 years, it was refreshing to find Green.   It's great to be able to enjoy a BBQ pulled pork sandwich or crab puffs... without having to sacrifice an animal.  More restaurants now are becoming vegetarian friendly, but there is something to be said about not having to choose between a salad and a Portobello burger, I can eat everything on the menu!   My absolute favorites are the thyme fries, Texas "Moo-shroom" Po-boy , and the orccietta pasta.  The food is tasty, but the atmosphere reminds me of a local dive bar.  I have only eaten in the restaurant twice; it's kind of an "artsy" place and not really my style.  I order takeout regularly though, the service is great and the cashier is always super friendly.  My boyfriend is a meat eater, and enjoys their food, he actually suggests it!   I recommend substituting Green for your next trip to Chili's and see what you think. I think you will be pleased, especially as a vegetarian or vegan.

I'll trade you one food city for one Trader Joes... I wish it worked that way!  My only gripe with TJ's is that there isn't one in old town.   I work in Tempe, so I manage to hit this one on my way home every once in a while.  TJ's is always busy, but the service is never lacking. TJ's employees are pretty knowledgeable about their wine selection, and have helped me find some great wines for super cheap.   My favorite thing about TJ's is they have a ton of vegetarian options and a rockin selection of hummus and dips!  As much as I love TJ's, the main downfall is that I can't go there for all my grocery needs, their produce section and "staple" items are pretty limited.

Booo.... What a freaking disappointment!  Bf and I have been so excited to try Los Dos Molino's, but were severely let down.   Starting with the salsa, it was hot and that was about it.  There was no flavor and no salt.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with blue corn tortillas topped with red sauce.  What I got was two yellow corn tortillas stacked on top of each other smothered with red sauce with maybe 2 Tablespoons of cheese sprinkled on top.   The sauce had a weird flavor, almost burnt, I can't really describe it. The beans were runny and the rice was dry.   Bf didn't particularly enjoy his chicken burro enchilada style either. I think this place received a lot of hype a few years ago which is the only reason people keep going, because the food is definitely below average.  We will not be back.

Bobby Flay delivers on Fla-vor! Hands down one of the best meals I've had in a really long time. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation while we were in Vegas, and I'm so glad we did! Here's the breakdown:   Drinks: A+  Hottie: A Manhattan with Pappy Van Winkle- He was very excited about it! Me: Not sure the name, but it had Charbay Grapefruit Vodka, Cranberry Juice, Grapefruit and lime, refreshing and delicious!  Appetizer: A+ Shared: Goat Cheese and Queso Fundido : Perfect concoction of gewy, salty, and creamy, served with fresh made chips! We had to fight over the last bite.   Dinner: A- (Didn't taste Hotties)  Hottie: Pork Tenderloin with Sweet potato tamale (He ate every bite!) Me: Mushroom Quesadilla and a side of Brussel sprouts.   The Quesadilla was excellent, but very rich.  The Brussel sprouts I didn't like, they had a weird taste to them that made me cringe, can't put my finger on what it was.    Dessert: A+++++++++ Toasted Coconut layer cake: OMG, we can never eat, drink or smell coconut again without thinking about this delicious moist, fabulous cake!  In fact I will never go to Vegas again and not eat that cake...

Not much to say here, but if you haven't tried Oregano's yet... stop what you're doing and go now!  They have a huge menu with tons of tasty stuff to choose from.  We almost always split a large whole wheat thin crust pizza and have a couple tall sunshine wheat beers; it's a little greasy and full of calories, but its comfort food at its best.   I have also tried their pastas, veggie sandwich and fried ravioli's too, and was equally as pleased.  The menu is very inexpensive for the portion sizes, and the service is always good.  I would recommend either getting there early or plan on waiting for a while, because it is always packed.

Wow, the Luxor needs and update in a series way! Not only is the layout of the hotel awkward, but the everything in the rooms is old.    To start off, there is one elevator entrance for the entire place which means you have to walk forever to get to, if your in one of the rooms caddy-corner... which we were. So forget about getting ice!   Luckily we didn't spend too much time in the hotel or the room, so I can't say much except... if you get a good deal and don't mind staying in a hotel straight out of the 90's. This will meet your expectations.

Excellent food, service and ambiance! Hottie and I like to find the top spots to eat, whenever we're on vacation... I have to say it was fantastic, but with all the options in Vegas, it may take a few more trips before we go back.  That being said, let's get to the meal.  We started off with a chopped greek style salad, it was better than  your traditional greek salad, but not particularly memorable.  My dinner on the other hand was fantastic! Homemade butternut squash tortellini, you could tell the pasta was made to order because it was a little organic and uneven... but I loved it!  Unfortunately Hottie's $50 Steak looked like they picked it up from the local grocery store for $5, very disappointing.  For dessert we had the chocolate fallen cake with ice cream.  I'm spacing on the flavor of the ice cream, but I remember it being particularly delicious! Overall we left fat and happy!

This hidden gem is a must stop for Mexican food, especially if you live in the East Valley.  I haven't been to Tia Rosa's in about 5 years, and boy has it improved.  The trees have grown so much that we drove past it twice because we didn't see the sign.  Tia Rosa's has two options, their front take-out restaurant and the main dining area.  It's just what you would expect when you walk into the Mexican style Hacienda, a water fountain and great courtyard for eating outside.  The menu is diverse and there are several vegetarian options.  I went with the Spinach enchiladas served with roasted corn and black beans, they were fantastic!  The table ordered carne asada, a beef burrito and the fish tacos.  All raved about the food.  The only complaint that we had was the salsa was just okay, it wasn't hot enough and their hot sauce was not very tasty.  We all wish we had a little more spice in our dishes, but the overall consensus is still a solid 4. If you decide to dine at Tia Rosa's try to get a table in the back courtyard or the room to the right of it, it will greatly improve the experience!

So this place was pretty neat.  We met my folks there for lunch on Saturday.   I am a huge fan of Le Grande Orange, so when they suggested it, I was pretty stoked to try it.   The restaurant itself has a modern yet organic feel.  The outside patio is just beautiful.  I would love to go there on a date with my Hottie and have a glass of wine by the fire place!  But I'll wait until fall =).    About the food, it was very good, no complaints. I had a homemade veggie burger and fries with Gruyere cheese.   The boys both ordered burgers and devoured them, so I assume they were good.  My Mom had the Short rib tacos and she raved about them, the server said that was there specialty and her favorite.   She also tried their white sangria which was pretty tasty too.     For dessert we had a chocolate flourless cake served with pistachio gelato and whip cream.... Um, can I say... YUM!

This is a cute little spot in between midtown and downtown, and perfect for lunch.  A group of us yelpers stopped in last week and really enjoyed the food. Carly's is nothing fancy, but our meals came out quickly and our server was very attentive. There were a ton of options for vegetarians, but I went with the grilled cheese and tomato soup, and substituted the prosciutto for avocado. The sandwich was very good, and the tomato soup was decent. Nothing to rave about, but at least it was homemade and it served as a good dip for my delicious sandwich.  Other's ordered their salads which looked very tasty, and they didn't skimp on portion sizes at all.

I found Udupi in the strangest way.   I was talking with my friend from NE Mesa, and she told me I was right next to her favorite Indian restaurant.  I thought it was ironic that I have been driving by it for a couple months and thought it was part of the laundry mat. Little did I know, it was a little piece of food heaven.   The atmosphere is less than desirable, but the food is fantastic!  The entire menu is vegetarian and I cannot recommend one thing, because it is all excellent. They do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own bottle and they don't make you pay a cork fee.   I recommend going with a group, this allows you to order multiple items and try them family style.

Nothing like chugging down some greasy cheese pizza before you shop!  Yes, the upstairs cafeteria has a good selection of cheep food, but I prefer to skip the crazy lines and snag me a piece of pizza and a coke for $2.50.    If you've never been there, the pizza/hot dog stand is by the checkout lines, so when you walk in, go past the escalator and take a sharp left. It's right by the market where you can purchase food to take home with you.  Quick tip for a party, grab a bag of meatballs and jar of lingberry jam.  Throw them in a crockpot with some chipotle seasoning and bbq sauce, and then just let it cook for a couple hours... It's always a huge hit and super simple! Thanks Ikea.

It's funny how I take advantage of the fact that I have an Ikea right next to my office. I didn't realize it until I had some friends come from out of town tell me they had driven across states to go to one! Okay, there are some great finds, but I think what you spend in gas will offset any savings.  Let's break it down...   The Good: 1.  Nice selection of modern fabric/curtains/shades: There are a ton of options to accommodate for most ceiling heights.  Also most window coverings can be mounted in several ways depending on your preference.  2. Kitchen accessories: I love Ikea napkins & Dishtowels.  Great quality and so cheap! Also, I picked up a wok and cast iron skillet that have proven to be very durable and both under $10.    3. Organization: there are tons of creative ideas for organizing just about every room in your house.  This is where sometimes Ikea can get a little pricy, but it's well worth it.    The Bad: 1. Furniture Quality: For the most part it is not that durable.  Remember the old saying "You get what you pay for"?...  Just don't be surprised if it breaks in less than a year.  2. Assembly: Just about everything in Ikea needs to be assembled... and there are no words on the instructions.  One dresser took my handy boyfriend about 2 hours to put together! 3. The parking: If you are handicap or part of a "family" you will likely be able to find a spot. For all others, plan on bit of hike to get into the store... even if they are not busy.

If you've ever drove by Penzey's and thought ... "what is this place?" then I feel better about myself. I walk to the neighboring Starbucks every weekend and asked myself that same question, yet never took the extra 30 steps to check it out.  I actually thought it was restaurant for a while! Then my neighbor turned me onto it when I was looking for smoked paprika.  Duh, Store named spices... maybe they sell um I don't know, SPICES!  I've only been there twice, but will continue to return until I move far far away or they shut down.  This place is awesome; they have every spice you can imagine and then some.  I thought everything would be loose and you would have to jar or bag it yourself, but that's not the case.  It's also very reasonably priced, about $4-7/jar.   They also have some special mixes for rubs, etc... If you're going to be in the area, it's a must see. You will walk out of the store with more than you came for, but your food will thank you for it!

I've been in love with Maggiano's since before it came to Phoenix!  I grew up going to the locations in Chicago, and am happy to say that the food quality and service is spot on in Scottsdale too!  Here are a few tips to dining at Maggiano's that will enhance the experience:   1. Make a reservation... they take them for all party sizes 2. Go with 4 or more people and dine family style! There are tons of menu options, the cost is reasonable, and its bottomless as long as the plate is clear!  3. Wear expandable clothes, you will over eat!  Some of my favorite vegetarian dishes include the maggiano's salad(no prosciutto) , mushroom ravioli, Gnocchi in Vodka sauce, and cheese ravioli in a creamy pesto sauce. I know, none of this is healthy, but every once in a while you need to let loose and enjoy fantastic Italian food!

Who put the pistachio's in the Beet Salad?  .... They are a genius!  We hit up Olive and Ivy for restaurant week on Saturday and we were more than pleased with entire experience.  They were pretty full so we took an early reservation for 5:45.  Starting at the bar, we enjoyed some  1/2 price drinks during Happy Hour.  The Pomegranate Martini is very tasty, and surprisingly not very sweet.   Once we got sat, everything at the table was spectacular starting with the hummus, then the sweet potato cannelloni and finishing with the coffee crème brulee.   I couldn't ask for a better meal.  The table agreed that the sweet potato was one of the best things they have ever eaten, it's a must!  I was in vegetarian heaven.   It was still a little hot to sit outside, but once fall kicks in, their patio at night is a romantic spot to grab a bite and enjoy some wine.

A little glimpse of doggy heaven!  I'm lucky that I didn't have to search too far to find the best dog park in town.  Chaparral dog park is very clean," most" owners follow the rules and most importantly my puppies go home exhausted.  I have two poodle puppies, and while they one may think he's a Great Dane, he definitely benefits from the passive dog area.   At this dog park, passive basically translates to small dog.  It's really nice because my lil angels (or hellions as my Hottie would say) can play like the big dogs do and not get trampled.   The park is equipped with waste bags and drinking fountains for the pups inside and right outside the park.   The passive area is primarily just grass and benches, but there is a fun (for them) little sand area with boulders that they like to chase either other through.   The middle dog area has some really cool obstacle courses, which I catch my little Stella staring at through the fence in admiration... maybe someday little one!  If you have a friendly dog, come out and play... just keep close and pick up after them when they leave you a present ;-)

Wow, best red coconut curry ever!  This place is great, totally not what I expected.  I went there for the first time with my friend for lunch.  We were sat right away and food came out about 20 minutes later. The service was just okay, we had to ask for our drinks twice and for a box, but they were busy, so I'll give her a pass. They attract a large lunch crowd and I was impressed how well they managed.   The salad bar was good too; it was small but had nice fresh veggies and a yummy peanut dressing!  My friend had the pad Thai with tofu, I thought it was okay, but the compared to the rocking flavor of the curry it really didn't stand a chance.  I will say, when I said I wanted it medium she highly recommended I go with mild spice and they could add more if needed... definitely didn't need it!  Yum, yum... go get some!

Custom burger, fries and drink for under $10... Yes, Please!  I've recently moved offices to a mere block away from Lenny's and couldn't take the torture of smelling my co-workers fries anymore, so I decided to give it a try.  I'll just say it was everything I had hoped for.   When I arrived promptly at noon, the place was already packed (good sign of deliciousness), so I hopped in line and pondered all the options for building my burger.  As a vegetarian, I get excited to see a menu that gives me options. I was pleasantly rang up by Lenny himself, who greeted me with a hand shake!  I decided on the Veggie burger topped with Cheddar cheese, BBQ, Ranch and green olives (Why not), with a side of sweet potato fries.  My meal was cooked to order, and only took about 10 minutes.  After picking up my order,  the long (20 ft) walk from the counter to the table was a test of my inner strength, as I wanted to plow my face into the shiny orange fries.  I contained myself for the moment and then devoured every last one of them.  Lenny's was definitely a lunch time treat and I will be back.  Although next time I need to plan a nap hour after my visit, because I was in a food comma!

How do I drive past this place every day and never stop?  Now that I've tried it... I won't make that mistake again!  D'lic has a great menu of fresh breakfast items including several vegetarian and gluten free selections.  Good bye starbucks, I found my new favorite coffee,  I'm so hooked!  Just beware the drive-thru is not super fast because all the food and drinks are made to order, but if you plan for a 10-15 minute wait you'll be fine.  The food is not cheap, but reasonable for fresh ingredients cooked to order.  Definitely give this place a try, great hang over cure after a nice out in OT!

I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth:  1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing! 2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal.  3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries.  I hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =(

I have no idea how my mediocre pedicure turned into $40! This place is a standard strip mall, sub-par experience with Spa prices! The staff was nice, but they didn't do a very good job.  I won't be back.

If you like good food and don't get caught up on fancy décor or expensive linens... you will love Salernos!  I've been going to Salerno's for years, but stopped going when I moved to Scottsdale because of the drive.   Boy have I been missing out! I went back this weekend and was in pizza heaven.  There is something about their cheese that just makes a pizza... oh wait, maybe because it's fresh!  I've tried their Gnocci and eggplant parmesan, which were great, but I go there for the pizza and sauce.   I could drink the sauce it's so good, which is why I always take a pint to go!

Diana is awesome, sweet, professional and makes me hair free! I have been going to Diana for laser treatments for about 8 months and have been very happy with the results. I started off with a one of the weekly plus deals, only to find out that her package deals were just as reasonable and available all the time. I waited to post a review, until I was confident in the results, so it's time!  If you are considering laser hair removal, Diana is the best. I have never once had any skin damage, or even been in pain during treatments. This summer I will definitely be her biggest advocate!

If you work in this area, Picazzo's is a great place to grab lunch with a co-worker.  It has a nice atmosphere and they can get you in and out in about 40-45 minutes.  It's a popular lunch spot because it has inexpensive lunch specials (Drink, pizza slice and gourmet salad combo for $9) and its gluten free pizzas.   You get a handful of options for the lunch slices, but they always have at least a veggie, a meat and a gluten free pizza ready.   I like the specials because it forces me to try something that I may not have chosen otherwise.  The entire pizza menu looks great though, I would like to try it when I'm not on my lunch hour!

In the past my ADD has been known to prevent me from frequenting the movies, primarily because of the cramped, uncomfortable seating and mediocre screen and sound quality.   This is not the case at Tempe Market place. I'm not going to try to play it off like it's cured my ability to focus, but it does have reclining seats, more open seating and excellent screen and sound quality... essentially, making the movie more tolerable. The Cine Capri is the best way to see a movie, but get there early.  Sitting in the front row can get very nauseating! Also, if you haven't figured it out yet, the kiosks on both sides of the ticket counter are self-serve (Pay with credit card), use them!

I can't believe I've never reviewed switch! Switch is pretty solid when it comes to food and service.  I've only eaten here for dinner once, but their lunch and happy hour are both very good. I work about a block away, so it's a great place to grab a bite, and they usually can get you in and out of there in an hour.  So far I have tried the black bean veggie burger and the Caprese sandwich, both are delicious! They have wedge and sweet potato fries which makes it really hard to choose, but after trying both I prefer the wedge fries which is surprising for me, but they're really that good!  Yesterday the table next to me ordered the mac n cheese, it looked fantastic! I'll be giving that a try soon.  The girls and I decided to splurge at lunch yesterday and ordered the red velvet cake.  I'm not a huge cake fan, but this was very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. Another quick tip for switch... they take reservations, even for lunch!

A little starch in atmosphere, but the concept is there and the service is honest.   I say "honest" because every time I've been there no matter who serves me, they don't seem phony and really enjoy being there, which makes me enjoy being there.    As someone mentioned before the wines are young, but have great potential.  If you've ever been wine tasting from a Barrel, you'll run into the same scenario, so you shouldn't frown on them for it... just store the bottle properly and give it a try in a year! I've purchased several bottles and I particularly enjoy the Melange and the sweet Ruby wine.  Their flight tasting is very reasonable 5 tastings for $10 is a steal!   I've also attended a bottling party there for my cousin which was a fun experience.  Su Vino is a great place for a first date; meet up with friends or coworkers.  Don't go there expecting to get filled up on appetizers, but they're available if you want something to munch on in between meals.   *I recommend checking their events calendar before you go, they do close occasionally for private parties.

Don't be confused by the Yelp definition, "Yay, I'm a fan",  Lowes gets 4 stars because they have great employees that get me out of there fast!  I'm not one that would typically be classified as "Handy", so the fact that I can go into Lowe's, and get someone to give me DIY instructions in about 5 minutes, makes me happy.  I've been to several Lowe's/Home Depot's in the past, but I feel compelled to review this location, because after 10+ trips (mostly on the weekends), I have never had to wait for assistance or behind more than one customer in line.  Also, they get bonus points for not only allowing my pups in the building, but complementing them on their cuteness =).

The well... um, don't know how to describe this place, besides maybe hole in the wall.   It was pretty grimy and totally not my style, but in the Well's defense, there seemed to be a lot of regulars there and they were having a ball.  It was a Friday night and one of my friends wanted to grab a drink, so we headed in out in lemme say casual gear... and we fit right in.  There was no bouncer, no one cocktailing tables, just a bartender.  It took us a few minutes to figure out we weren't getting service so we went to the bar to grab a beer, I asked the bartender what was on tap and he didn't really want to deal with me, I don't know I guess he knew we weren't regulars and didn't want to bother?  We sat outside, backs to Scottsdale road, but managed to stay pretty quiet.  I really have nothing bad to say, but I probably won't go back.  It if you're looking for a dive bar, the well is the place to go... but you might need to go back a few times to get decent service.

Um.... Okay?  That pretty much sums up my experience with Dave and Busters.  I would not recommend this place unless you are into playing arcade games.    I went with some coworkers and their spouses.  We chose D&B because we thought it would a fun way to bond as a team.  We started off with dinner. The menu looked promising for American style food.... and then it came out.  Nothing was tasty, not even the French fries, who screws up French fries?  Okay, so we didn't go there for the food we went there for the games and such.  We were told that it was an adult atmosphere, and by adults,  I can only assume they meant over  13?  The only activities centered towards adults were the pool tables which had a 3 hour wait.  Also the whole upstairs was shut down for a private party.  We played a few arcade games to use up our $20 of purchased tickets while drinking a watered down rum and coke and then headed to Cadillac ranch.

Parched from a day full of shopping, I decided to stop into Tea Infusion to get rehydrated.  After sorting through the list of 200+ tea options, I decided on an Iced white blueberry tea.  The final result was fantastic, although I inhaled it so quickly I had brain freeze! The only negative (which can't be fixed) is that it takes 3 minutes to brew the tea, so I'm standing there salivating at the bar, watching the timer count down!  Next time I'll ask for a water to get hydrated so I can enjoy my tea!

Te, Te, Te, tequila... Margarita! Holy heaven Cien Agave has the best margaritas in town.  Hottie and I decided to take a seat on the patio during Sunday happy hour to enjoy the Arizona sunshine.  We weren't planning on eating, but after seeing the food being served we decided to give their tacos and some guacamole a try.  I had a veggie taco on a flour tortilla.  It was excellent; they actually grilled up the veggies and the tortilla, giving it the nice crunch of a taco without the frying.  The guacamole was just okay; I've had better and can definitely make a better batch at home.   A good Mexican food restaurant typically has a solid chips and salsa presentation, but their salsa was weak and had gringo written all over it! I'm glad I ended up ordering a taco, because it gave me a better peek into their menu.  We will definitely be back for Happy hour; you can't get a rockin' $3.50 margarita and $2 taco anywhere else in Old Town!

I remember the days when you had to practically take a day off of work to go to the DMV.  I've visited two DMV's in the past month and have been more than pleased with the service provided, and the time I spent taking care of the issue.   At this location, I arrived at about 8:15 on a Monday, waiting maybe 10 minutes to get called, and was out the door by 8:45.  This included taking care of paperwork and getting a new license.  Not only were the employees efficient, they were actually very friendly and helpful.  It is apparent that the DMV has worked very hard in the past few years to improve their tarnished image... I guess the government has managed to get something right!

Do you like cheap fresh produce? Will you eat anything? If you answered Yes, then you should give BB a try.  There is something about the surprise of what's going to be in the basket, and the community coming together that excites me.  They bring the bounty, I bring the basket, it's a win, win!    I've participated in the BB pick-ups about a half dozen times now, and have always been happy with the quality and quantity of produce received.  I will warn you, sometimes you get items that are very ripe, and some under ripe, so you'll need to plan your menu accordingly.  Also, you may get some off the wall items such as turnips or tomatillos... but as long as you know how to Google recipes you'll be okay!  I've also taken advantage of their weekly specialty packs (Salsa, Mexican and Asian) which I have been pleased with.   Quick Tip: If there is not a location near you, keep checking their site, they are always adding more locations.... And don't forget to bring a basket!

Nothing about it was good for me, but everything about it was good!  My friends have been raving about Forefather's for the past year and despite working less than a mile away I hadn't tried it.  Being a vegetarian I figured there would be nothing for me to eat.  I was wrong, they have a nice salad menu (that can be modified) and their tomato soup and grilled cheese is fantastic!  I wanted to try the sweet potato fries, but couldn't possibly put one more thing in my stomach.  The place is nothing fancy, order your food at the counter, and pick it up at the counter, but the service was still great.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the mood for some greasy comfort food.

I found it, I really found it!  For the past two years, I've been looking for a solid thin crust pizza with green olives, doesn't sound like a huge feat, but it's been treacherous! I've found good pizza with no green olives, and green olives with terrible pizza, neither the combination I was looking for.  Little Chicago's finally did it, Crunchy crust, tangy sauce, real salty cheese, and green olives!  The prices are also pretty reasonable, you might pay 20 % more that Papa John's, but homemade sauce and crust is well worth it!

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.... Loving Side Door!  We had tried it once for takeout and were not overwhelmed by it, but since it's a hop, skip and a jump away from our place, we decided to try it again and dine -in! The menu is not published online, so if you're wondering... it basically serves sandwiches, salads and pizza, all made fresh.  We both ordered pizza.  My bf was particularly excited that they had Peroni on tap!  You need to check out the picture of the portion of wine they served... reminded me of my grandpa, always filling the glass to the top! The pizza was very good, I had the 5 cheese and you could actually taste the gouda and fontina, it was greasy, fattening and fantastic! Bf had the El Pollo pizza with artichokes, mushroom, sundried tomato, chicken, and olives with a balsamic drizzle.  He loved it.  There was a small band playing that night and the place was pretty busy. There was one girl serving the entire place and she was a rockstar, never missed a beat!  We are looking forward to our next visit.  I think we found our new neighborhood bar!

Roasted salsa and portabella enchiladas... I'm a fan! I can't believe I've never been here.  Hottie and I are always on the hunt for good Mexican food. Scottsdale falls short every time.  This is actually a pretty quick drive for us, with the 202 right behind us.  Okay back to the food. I tried the veggie enchiladas and the portabella mushroom enchiladas. Both were good, but I don't' think I would ever order anything but the mushroom enchiladas again. They were the most delicious enchilada I've ever had... topped with a marsala sauce.. OMG!!!  For desert we had an apple crisp made with a sopapilla and topped with ice cream, a great alternative to fried ice cream.  I'll be back!!!

I always have good time at this place.  I could write a page about Geisha, but the previous reviews pretty much sum this place up.        *   Self servicing bathrooms (Ladies only)      *   Fantastic Happy Hour pricing- The veggie pot stickers are the bomb!     *   Hot waitresses ... barely of age to serve you alcohol =)     *   Private karaoke rooms that allow you to humiliate yourself in front of your friends only  The only thing I would steer clear of is the specialty drinks they are overly sweet and are not made with fresh fruit... even when they say they are. The waitress cleared that up for me last weekend =).

Scratch saved me a few weeks ago!  We went to a restaurant (to remain unnamed) that had a terrible dessert menu. Even though I was craving something sweet I was not going to settle for the garbage they were selling.  So I stopped at Scratch on the way home, and was surprised to see the place packed with dinner guests.  It's a small place so I was able to scope out the plates, and everything looked very appealing, lots of color on the plates and appeared to be prepared nicely.  The ladies at the counter were very helpful and honest in recommending a dessert, so I ended up with two: A macaroon type pastry with caramel filling and a raspberry chocolate mousse cake.  I was very happy with my selections, and I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast and dinner menu's soon.

My new favorite breakfast spot! Let's start with the Nutella crepes... Yum, Yummy in my tummy!  My friend and I were nursing a little hangover, so we were ready to chow down and ordered the crepes to split and our own meals =).  I had the omelet with a variety of cheeses, served with a fresh green salad and hash brown patty, it was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the salad on the side. I was also very impressed with their coffee, the strength was just right and served in a huge mug, so I only had to ask for one refill!  Because of the time we made it to the joint, other patrons were eating lunch, and I couldn't help notice a mouth watering bowl of tomato soup ... that will be on my next visit for sure!

For someone who hates dive bars, I can't believe I'm a fan of Patti's! There really is something for everyone at Patti's Pool tables, video games, stripper pole, juke box.... smoking.  You'll also notice that there is really not a crowd "type" here.  Total randomness!  I've been to Patti's at least a dozen times, and it is always good for 3 things:  1.  Stiff Drinks 2.  Getting  tipsy and not giving a "Darn" 3.  Watching the less coordinated attempt to use the stripper pole!  On the down side, it can take some time to get your drinks becuase there is typically only a couple bartenders for a fairly large facility.

As an olive enthusiast, I was excited to hear about a trip out the Olive mill with the family.  Looking forward to a day filled with olive testing and touring, I was little disappointed to find there really wasn't much of that happening.  There was a little olive oil testing available in the store, but with nothing to apply it to, it was a bit strange.  They also had some spreads/tapenades available for testing which were all pretty tasty. I ended up purchasing the caramelized onion and fig spread.   The tour was a little strange as well, they walk you out into the main picnic area and tell you about the history of the mill and infuse it with way too many corny olive puns.  After that discussion they walk you into a tent, where you sit at picnic tables and the tour guide goes through the steps of making olive oil via a few posters hung on the walls.  The presentation was pretty informative, but there was no actual tour of anything.  At the end you received a tasting of about 5 different kinds of olives sold in the store.   The olives were good, worth the five bucks for the "tour"... but it was just a little disjointed because the tour was about making olive oil, yet they give you an olive tasting at the end (Which they did not mention once).   We ate lunch at the restaurant inside and overall we were all pleased with our meals.  I had a veggie Panini, with potato chips.  The veggies were fresh and the chips very crisp, with just the right about of salt.  I tried one of their famous Meyer Lemon cupcakes, it was okay.  The frosting was a little too sweet and cupcake a little on the dry side. I had a feeling they were not made that day.  The outside picnic area was nice; there was a live musician playing, some mediocre local wine tastings, and shortbread tasting from a local vendor. I applaud their efforts to keep everything local (both at the restaurant and with the entertainment). Overall the experience was a 3.5, but the olive oil and spread I purchased were a solid 4, and at the end of the day, that's their product!

I hate running barefoot! ...  But I would do it again for the perfect shoes. That statement may not make sense, so let me explain. At Road Runner sports, you can get a free evaluation of your feet and your run style prior to getting fit for running shoes.  I have been running for about 15 years, and never knew I had a severely high arch, which means I have been buying the wrong kind of shoes for this entire time.   The evaluation itself takes about 20 minutes, but there were a few people on the list before me, so the whole trip took about an hour.  Let me warn you, they will try to sell you custom inserts for your shoes... that's where they try to recoup the cost for the evaluation machines.  I refused to buy them because I didn't want to spend another $80 on top of the cost of shoes, and I've never used them before.  Despite the overkill on the insert selling, the associate who assisted me was very attentive and stuck with me through the whole process (Evaluation, shoe selection and purchase).  Road Runners has a nice selection of shoes, and great sales. I picked up a $110 pair of shoes on sale for about $75.    ** TIP:  I didn't need to use this, but when I called the store, I was told that they will honor prices on the road runners website (even though they are not directly tied to the website store) if mentioned at the time of purchase.

I never left Pitaya without a bag in my hand. This place has some great accessories, tops, and dresses at a reasonable price.   The selections are mostly casual clothes and some stuff for a night out.  What I like about Pitaya is they have limited inventory of all their clothes, so unlike forever 21 or the Gap, it isn't likely that there will be 100 clones out there in the same outfit!  I've never made a special trip to go to Pitaya, but always make a point to stop if I'm on Mill Avenue.

I'm pretty much content with a solid order of sweet potato fries, and Maize's nailed it!  My girlfriends and I hit up Maize's after a yoga session in the park downtown (Yes, thank you for not turning us away for being scrubby and sweaty!).  After a seriously long internal debate on whether to order breakfast or lunch, I decided to compromise with a mimosa (breakfast) and the Uptown Caprese sandwich with sweet potato fries (lunch).  We started off with spinach and artichoke dip, it was good, not the best I've had, but a solid start.   The sandwich on the other hand, was sinful!  The balsamic dressing paired perfectly with the cheese, basil and Panini bread!  The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked and salted.   I'll admit I drooled over my friend's blueberry topped raisin French toast throughout the entire meal, so next time I'll have to try breakfast!  Overall, great food, great service!

Let me start by saying, I rarely give out 5 stars, so my 4 star review means "Yay, I am a fan"... Just feeling a little guilty, that my review may take down the rating of a great salon, but I need to be consistent.    After my Esthetician of 2 years decided to leave the industry, the past 6 months has proven to be a nightmare finding a replacement.  From only one experience, I can't say with certainty, but I may have found her!  I booked my appointment online via android... or so I thought. I called to confirm the day of, and it turns out it didn't go through. D'Lisa was so accommodating that she moved her facial scheduled at that time to get me in, because it was the only time I could go in that week.   Now, we're talking a Brazilian here, so I don't expect to be skipped into the room. laughing during the process, and finishing up with hi-fives, but that's actually what the experience reminded me of.  (Of course minus the skipping and hi-fives).  D'Lisa was great. She was quick but thorough, and it was relatively painless.   Exactly what I look for in a waxing... get it over with so I can put my panties back on!  I don't need champagne, V-gazzles or aroma therapy... just a smooth bikini line!

Okay, I've been back to D'Lisa 3 times and can now officially say "WooHoo! As good as it gets".  There is not much more to add from my previous review, except D'lisa is truly talented.  She gets me in and out in less than 30 minutes and doesn't miss a hair.  I do recommend booking your appointment in advance; she is getting booked up quick these days!

Yuuuuuummmmmyyyyyy! I love Café Monarch!  We went there for our anniversary last Friday and I was very excited to see what Chef Christopher would come up with for dinner.  My bf gave them a heads up that I was a vegetarian, but other than that, the entire meal was a surprise.  It was exciting because we didn't get menus, we just sat down with our bottle of wine and were asked if we were ready for our first course. That's a good indication of what's to come if the chef if is that confident in his food that he assumes you will like what's on the menu... and we DID!  We started with a grilled pear, brie and walnut salad served with a cranberry citrus vinaigrette, the flavors were excellent, it was something I've never paired together.  For our entrée I had a bean sprout patty topped with grilled eggplant and a mushroom sauce. The sauce was amazing!  I am actually going to try to make it myself this week.   I'm not a huge fan of bean sprouts, so if I would have seen a menu, I probably wouldn't have ordered it, but then would have missed out on some fabulous flavors!  So, I guess I do like bean sprouts =).   We sat out on the patio, which was candle lit and cozy.  I think sitting inside would have been a fun experience too, but less romantic.  Inside has a few tables and a small completely open kitchen.  It reminds going to a neighbor's house for dinner and watching him cook.  The whole dining experience is very inviting, and the food is unique and excellent.   We will definitely be back!!

First impression... all I need to say is Snottsdale hostesses! I showed up at Blanco on a Tuesday night at 5:40 with 10 girls.  The patio and the dining room were half empty and the hostess said she needed a few minutes to get set up, understandable.   After about 15 minutes another hostess came over to ask us what we needed.  Meanwhile people are walking in and getting sat immediately.   Then we see a server pushing some tables together on the patio and setting up the table for 10 people.  Five more minutes go by and we were more than annoyed, so we decided to seat ourselves at that table.   Once we got seated, our server was friendly and attentive.  Average food, average drinks... I ordered a pomegranate and grapefruit margarita, the juice was supposed to be fresh squeezed, but I it tasted like pure sugar.   I ordered a taco salad with no meat and it was so drenched in dressing that I couldn't even eat the lettuce.   Two girls who ordered a different salad and actually sent theirs back for the same reason.   The other meals that came out to the table looked much better, so maybe I just made bad menu selections.

Give the bear a big kiss!  The lodge is a great spot to stop and enjoy a nice Arizona day or night. I'd describe it as a somewhere in between a dive bar and an "Ultra lounge", pretty much anything goes here.  The patio is great for people watching because it's nestled in a corner that faces many of the Old Town "hot spots"!   The food is decent, comfort style food that pairs well with adult beverages!  Both food and drink prices are reasonable, and they have great HH specials!

If the lodge didn't over charge my card 3 visits in a row, I would recommend this place. Instead I have to expose them for the repeated credit card errors they have made! Maybe this will force them to hire some honest servers, but probably not! This has also happened to two of my other friend several times as well... very disappointing.   This past Saturday, We went to the lodge at about midnight for some late night snacks we ordered $30 worth of food and drinks. My friend and I split the bill (So about $20 each after tip).  She messaged me today to see if I was billed for the meal, because her card was charged $30. I checked my account and they charged me $40, and these were posted charges, not pending!!  This has happened too many times and every time I have to call several times to dispute it, and a manage never happens to be around.  At this point I'm convinced that their servers do this intentionally in hopes that people will be too drunk to remember what they did or leave their receipts behind, so they can't dispute it.  Well I definitely was NOT drunk and I know I was ripped off.    You have lost a customer because of your bad business practices and dishonest servers.

I was super disappointed that my first visit to daily dose was a total bust. I've looking forward to trying them out for quite some time.  It started off fine, we were sat right away and the server was very friendly... but then it went downhill. I asked for a recommendation from the server on drinks that weren't too sweet.  He recommended the sangria, which was so sweet I couldn't drink it.  I was starving, so we ordered the mushroom fondue appetizer to start, and our meals.  Our server got slammed; the hostess gave him 4 more tables all at once almost immediately after we sat down.  After 30 minutes, when he came back to check on us, I sent the drink back and inquired about our appetizer.  He said he totally forgot to put it in, and that it would come out the same time as our meals, was that okay?  No, it wasn't okay, didn't I mention I was starving!  He asked the busser (or whoever it was) to get us some chips and salsa right away.   Those never came either.   By the time we got our dinner, it was hard to even enjoy it because our entire dining experience had been ruined.   I guess my veggie burger was okay.   The manager or lead server, not sure who she was came over and offered us a free dessert, but we were just ready to leave.   I think we'll give daily dose another try, in hopes that this was a fluke... but need a little time so we can erase that experience out of my minds!

DD, you have redeemed yourself!  After my first nightmare experience at DD, I decided to give it another shot.  It was Friday night, Happy Hour with a party of 8, a recipe for disaster.  I called ahead and was delighted to hear they accepted reservations.  We were sat immediately upon arrival and greeted by our server shortly after.  If you've never been to DD, their Happy hour is awesome and runs until 8PM.   The HH menu has a little bit of everything including starters, entrees, salads, drinks, and burgers.   I started off with the mushroom and brie fondue and a hibiscus margarita. Both were excellent; I just wish they served it with more dipping items. It came with a few small slices of pretzel and a couple veggies, so I ended up with a bunch of fondue and a spoon!  Other starters ordered included a shrimp "cocktail", pretzels and crab cakes.  Those who ate them seemed very pleased as they disappeared quickly.   For dinner I went with the Veggie burger.  It was homemade and very tasty.  Unfortunately I had gorged myself in fondue so was unable to eat hardly any of it.   A few other burgers were ordered at the table, some tacos, a huge salad (Which was on HH too) and a couple orders of sliders. The sliders looked awesome; they were much bigger than any other slider I have ever seen.  My initial reaction was to upgrade my review to a 3, but after further consideration I've decided 4 stars is more appropriate considering the quality and price of the food.

The only way to have a good time at Junkie is to get there early and snag a table, or be a hot 20 year old and butter up the bouncer... and then the bartender when you get inside.   If either of those doesn't work for you, then plan on waiting in a long line and getting terrible service at the bar.    Don't let my opening statement steer you away, there is potential for a good time here.  Of the handful of times I've subjected myself to the low scale, high priced, barely 20 something bar, I've had fun twice.   The key both of those times was getting a table!! The waitress counts on you for her tips, so she will be attentive and she has "pull" with the bartender so you can get your drinks way quicker.   Every time I've had to go to the bar, I've been completely ignored. Now, I'm no supermodel, but I'm not too sore on the eyes either... not even my D cups worked!  At our last visit we actually ordered some appetizers, they were just okay, but exactly what I would expect from bar food.  I struggle with my rating because I would give Junkie a 3 for the two times I had a good experience, but 1.5 for the others.  I guess that tells me that my fellow yelpers have done us solid with a current rating of 2.5.

Sugar Free Carmel Sauce.... Yum!  I am a huge fan of Brubaker's coffee house.  I frequent this location a couple times per week before work... and sometimes mid day when I need a boost. ;-) The service is great!  I use the drive -thru and I am always on my way in less than 5 minutes, something I can't say about Starbucks!  Their pastries are baked fresh and their breakfast sandwiches made to order (and are huge!). My favorite thing about Brubaker's is their selection of sugar-free items, being hypoglycemic I need to watch my sugar intake and tend to have a minimal selection of sugar free syrups to choose from.   At Brubaker's they have syrups, sauces and no refined sugar pastries... so I am not limited to one or two choices.   If you are in the area, skip starbucks and hit up Brubaker's, you won't be disappointed!

Overpriced, Overhyped and underwhelmed! I was terribly disappointed with my experience. The food wasn't awful, but it was uninventive and one note.  I felt like they were trying too hard to be cute and trendy, rather than focusing the flavor and providing a balanced meal.  Also while I understand that a true improvisational cuisine is hard to accomplish with a restaurant that size,  it was pretty clear they had a set menu for the night and just rotated it between the tables. For example, I noted in my restrictions "Vegetarian, eat dairy LOVE cheese".  I was served no dairy what so ever.  By my third course I complained because so far my food had been mediocre, and round 3 tasted like a stew, everything was cooked in the same broth.  Not to mention I couldn't cut through the asparagus with my knife or my teeth!   The server was great, when I complained she had them make me a new course, parmesan risotto. It was better, but not creative and definitely didn't have a "wow" factor.    She also brought us out a nice cheese plate on the house, which was by far the best part of the meal. Overall, I was very impressed with the service and completely underwhelmed by the food.    I have no problem paying $$$ for a stellar meal, but not for one that left me hungry and craving protein! We won't be back.

From fall through spring the Greenbelt is the best place for a bike ride, jog, rollerblade, Frisbee golf or just some good old people watching!   I have lived along the green belt for over 3 years... moved twice but my home selection criteria included two things "Pool & within  1/2 mile of the greenbelt".   Once you've been spoiled with it, it's a hard amenity let go.   There is water along the path, so you don't need to carry any with you.  On the weekends there are tons of activities and people so if you're going for a long run, it really helps to kill the time.   There is also a small skateboard park, around Thomas which is pretty entertaining.   The path extends from the Papago park area in Tempe all the way to Central/North Scottsdale, so it's great for bike riding if you want to avoid the street lights. Just watch out for pedestrians and dogs!

The funny thing about Civic Center plaza is you don't realize how cool it is until you go there on a day where there is no festival, or event being held!  There are unique art sculptures in the park and tons of little coves that are tucked away, where you can go to read a book... or make out! The plaza also connects you to some fantastic bars, restaurants, the library, a historical museum, SMoCA, and the performing arts center. If you go there on any weekend during the spring, you are bound to find some live music, and local art displayed in the park.

Go to classic car spa if you want to spend too much money on a crappy car wash. I have been going to this location for the past couple years, and it has been bought out and/or taken over by new ownership a couple times.   I used to get great service and a high quality wash, but lately it has been beyond disappointing. The sales people push you to upgrade your service, and then the extra you pay for doesn't get done.    In the past I would go there for an oil change, but got so frustrated by the mechanics trying to sell me on $300 in "necessary" services every time.   So I deciding to go to NAPA for my oil change, and asked them to look into some of the recommended services that Classic had pushed.... None of them needed to be done, seriously!!!  My last time visit (yesterday) was the final straw for me.  I asked the sales lady how long the basic wash would take and she said 15-20 minutes.  Then she said if I upgrade the premium it would only take an extra 5 minutes and I would get a complete interior dressing opposed to the standard wipe down and vacuum. So I went with this option (+$9).   45 minutes later my car was done and I took a quick look inside and they didn't even wipe down the center consol.   I asked the guy to take care of this, so he did and then I get in my car and drive away... as I am driving I look at the dash and dashboard and realize they didn't even wipe certain areas and there was definitely no "dressing".  They essentially gave me a half-ass basic car wash, charged me for a premium and took twice as long as they promised.  DO NOT GO THERE!!!

This place is pretty tasty. The menu has a modern twist on your traditional Mexican food, but in a good way.  It was a Saturday at about 2PM, and we noticed a lot of people were eating breakfast (served all day), which made us think maybe that was their specialty, but we were in the mood for lunch. We started off with chips and guacamole.  They added mandarin oranges (or tangerines, not quite sure) to the standard mix... it was excellent, probably the best guac I have ever tasted!  I had the veggie tacos and mashed pinto beans.  The veggies were seasoned and marinated perfectly, and the beans were pretty good but a little dry.   My Bf had the Carne Asada burrito and he was in heaven.  The restaurant is actually located in a hotel lobby, which I wasn't expecting, so we passed it twice! The menu isn't huge and the atmosphere is casual and just so, so, but the food was fantastic.  We will definitely go back, next time we're in the neighborhood... and maybe give the breakfast a shot!

I decided to give Parlor a shot for a mid-day rendezvous with my boyfriend and was pleasantly surprised.     It was noon, the parking lot was full, but we were sat at a booth immediately.   The atmosphere was similar to that of the Vig Uptown, modern but inviting.  I had the Fungi pizza (Assorted Mushrooms, Goat cheese and truffle oil), it was fantastic!  My BF had an Italian sandwich called the Grinder, it was essentially Italian meats and cheeses with giardiniera.   He thoroughly enjoyed it... I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it.  We also started with some grilled olives from the Queen Creek Olive Mill; they were very tasty and only $2, perfect snack while we waited on our meals.   Definitely give this place a try, it's nothing fancy but a great spot for a casual date or meet up with friends.

Let's get fired up! *Claps* and *spirit sprinkles*... sorry the ex-cheerleader couldn't help but think of that chant when I walked in.  =P.  Okay, now we can talk about the joint.  The first thing that came to mind when I walked in was, this place has some character!  What a refreshing change from the overpopulation of chain restaurants on Ray road.  I was greeted immediately as I walked up to the front door, and the service continued to impress me throughout the entire meal.  I was waiting for my friends to arrive, so I decided to take advantage of the last few minutes of Happy hour and order a hummus tray and PAMI tini (Pomegranate martini). The Martini was very good, not as sweet as most places, which I prefer.  The pita bread on the hummus tray was fantastic, toasted just perfectly.  Of the trio we preferred the chipotle and pesto, the jalapeño cilantro was a little bland and surprisingly not spicy.   For dinner we all ended up ordering the same thing, so I can only report on one item.  It was their baked rotollo ... and it was fantastic!  It was like a huge manicotti stuffed with cheese, veggies and pesto, then topped with more cheese and red sauce.... an Italian vegetarians dream!  Fired up grill is a hidden gem in the middle of the chain mafia in Chandler. I'll definitely be back.

I HATE the dentist, avoid it all costs... not anymore! I had a chipped tooth and I couldn't avoid it any longer. Dr. Parsanko came highly recommended to me by a good friend, so I decided to give him a try. I've now been back 3 times and feel confident in providing a good recommendation.  Let's start with the front office, Rhonda is a sweetheart, she is knowledgeable, helpful and efficient.  I have never had to wait more than 2 minutes from the moment I walked in to get taken back. Dr. Parsanko and his assistant are also top notch. I was told by a previous dentist that I needed a couple fillings replaced and that I had a new cavity. I never went back to that place for the services because I didn't trust the dentist or the front office manager. When I talked to Dr. P about getting these services done, he told me it wasn't necessary, and I didn't have any new cavities. I guess my instinct on the other Dentist was correct. That could have been an easy $600 for him to pocket and he didn't! Another unheard of part of my experience is that the Doc actually cleaned my teeth... I've never had a dentist do it; it's always been an assistant.  I don't want to ramble any more here, but definitely give Dr. P a try, you'll be happy you did.   (And they have been running Yelp Check-In offers, so make sure you check-in!)

If you haven't tried Clean Air Cab company, you are seriously missing out! We stumbled (literally) upon them one night out in Old Town and were pleasantly surprised that the fare home was about $1.50 cheaper than discount.  That may not sound like much, but we only live 2 miles away.  We've used them several times since, and have been equally pleased.  They are very quick to pick up and you can also schedule a pick-up in advance online, and get an estimated fare.   I used this method last week to go to the airport and it worked out great. Sorry green car, from now on we'll be riding baby blue from now on!

I tried Total Wine for the first time during its Grand Opening weekend... I was greatly disappointed, 4 of the 6 bottles of wine I had purchased had gone bad.  I kept them on my counter for a few weeks and never took them back... I wish I did now!  I waiting a few months then decided to try it again, to pick up some Espresso vodka.  I found that their regular prices for my Van Gogh Vodka was $6 less than I've found it at Bevmo on Sale!  I also picked up some other great liquors and mixers while I was there.  The selection of wine and spirits there is unreal... it's like a Cosco for booze.   Since after this trip, I was very impressed with the selection and pricing. I went back again for some more liquor and was pleased again.  The next time I decided to give their wine another try.  I had just taken a trip to Napa and had some specific wines in mind that I wanted to purchase.  They had all but one.  The gentleman helping me was very knowledgeable, he knew the vineyard and suggested a couple other wines that would be very similar, he was correct, they were awesome!    I would recommend stopping in Total wine, they had a slow start with me, but have since gained momentum and have taken my favorite liquor store award away from Bevmo!

The best thing about Marcella's is the service.  It's hard to give a restaurant less than 4 stars when you get great service and you enjoy the meal. If I had received mediocre service, this would be a solid 3 star venue, nothing more.  Now, let's get to the meal:  The good:  Hot Bread served with Pesto- Awesome and complimentary! Spinach and Artichoke dip- Nothing traditional about it, but super tasty.    Butternut squash tortellini- Melted in my mouth... and made me love Brussels sprouts even more!  The Not so good:  The wine selection- We tried 4 different wines and were not excited about any of them.  Profiteroles- (Stuffed pastries with homemade ice cream).  Pastries were cold and not fresh.  The ice cream was okay, but the "Ganache" was more like a pool of Hershey's syrup.    To sum it up, the ambiance and the service get 4 stars and the meal a 3.  Since I am a sucker for good service and a great outdoor patio, Marcella's gets 4 stars overall.  Plus they have a great happy hour, and I would go back... especially if I was at the mall.

A big thanks to my fellow yelpers for this recommendation. This was definitely the least painful oil change ever! I always dread getting an oil change, because I feel like I'm walking into a lion's den.  Well not here! The guys working here very nice and made me feel very comfortable.  They did the "Check Engine", the oil change, and explained everything to me in less than 20 minutes.  Also, they didn't try to sell me on anything I didn't need.   I don't know why I would ever go anywhere else.

Cru-Do, or Cru-Don't? Crudo forshizzle! My hottie and I tried Crudo for the first time last Friday, and left very satisfied.  The idea of it being in a Salon is a bit strange, especially because the salon is also a boutique... so inside it appears to have a bit of identity crisis, but the outside seating is quant, comfy and offers some great Scottsdale people watching!  The menu is unique; all items are served in small portions, designed for you to try several items.  As a vegetarian, I was offered several options for modification on the menu, so don't be put off by the selections you see online, there is plenty to eat!  Also, the desserts are made daily, so they are not listed on the menu.   Everything was absolutely excellent, starting with the avocado salad, all the way through the goat cheesecake! Our server was very helpful and Chef Cullen came out to check on us a few times as well.  I would definitely recommend Crudo for a special occasion, unless spending $120 for dinner is an everyday thing for you.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.

Fried Squash blossoms!  How do they come up with this stuff?  FnB gets 5 stars for creativity and service... oh, and the food is pretty amazing too!   The menu changes with the season, so I apologize in advance for making your mouth water by mentioning  food you'll probably never taste.   We started off with the appetizer special, Fried Squash blossoms stuffed with burrata served with fresh tomato sauce, and an order of naan with eggplant puree.  The Naan plate was nothing special, but the blossoms were fantastic.  For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto.   The pasta was amazing, I watched the chef make my pesto to order... mmmm basil!  Hottie devoured every bite, so I would say he enjoyed his chops too.  For desert we shared the panna cotta with cherries, it was the perfect ending to a great meal.  This place gets 5 starts all the way, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable and the food was superb.  Thank you FnB

Feeling a bit behind on the latest restaurants, my boyfriend and I made a pact to try a new restaurant every week until the end of the year to start getting caught up!  So I'm a bit embarrassed to say, that I had never tried 5th and Wine, I've been meaning to, but it never seemed to match up with my plans.  So week 1 was my choice... 5th and Wine, and what a great choice it was!   We got there right after HH ended (6PM), but were happy to hear we were offered an ever better special, "Date night".  Date night includes 2 glasses of wine, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert, all for $40.   You could choose from any wine sold by the glass! This special runs Mon-Wed, but expires 9/15/2010.    The restaurant is a fairly open concept, you have a few options when you arrive, sit at the couches, at a table, or at the bar.   We sat at a table.  Let's start with the wine, I tried two the Petite Syrah ($6) and the Cab Franc ($8), both were recommended by the server and both were excellent.   I also tried the bruchetta appetizer, not as tasty as Postino's, but similar concept and good.  The rest of the meal was standard fare, but all very good. My bf raved about his Salmon and said his Caesar salad was "Solid".  Overall we were very satisfied and will definitely go back soon.   Nothing was the" best thing I ever had", but I just really liked it... kind of hard to explain, but give it a try then maybe you can help me articulated it!

Solid lunch spot! Met up with some fellow yelpers for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try that I had a hard time narrowing it down to the grilled cheese sandwich.  But it was delicious, topped with avocado... yum!  This is a small place so get there a little early for lunch, it was packed by noon.   Once the weather cools down there is a lot more space on the patio so that should help.  I'll definitely be back, thanks Amy H and Jon H for telling me about it!

So we checked out Mabel's for a girl's night out.  We were bar hoping so it we were only there for about an hour.  It was a very chill place, but in a sophisticated way.  The drinks were a little pricey, I had a Grey goose and soda and it was $11, usually that would be $7-9 in OT.  When we arrived on Friday at 10:30, we snagged a table right away (There were 10 of us) and our server was all over our table, in a good way.  We never had to ask for a drink, she asked us before our glass was empty.   I am looking forward to trying out Mabel's again soon.   I found out they do have HH from 5-7 daily (Closed Monday).

All I can say is you get what you pay for.... I received a coupon in the mail and thought maybe I would stray from my normal esthetician, who I have been going to regularly for over a year, terrible idea.  This place is all about the masses... turn and burn, literally! The esthetician was super friendly, and the waxing wasn't painful during the session, it was what I encountered after.  The area was blood red for three days followed by peeling and scabbing.  To top it off she missed two whole areas.  I will never go back here and recommend you don't either.  Pay the extra money to get a quality waxing!!!

How can you complain about a retail store that sells trendy clothes for super cheap! I've recently come to terms with the fact that sometimes buying cheap clothes is not a bad thing.  The quality is not superb here, and most items won't last more than 5 washings, but for a $25 dollar dress, I can deal with that.  Forever 21 stores have a huge selection of clothes and they try to organize them by "theme" or style. It can be very overwhelming, so you should plan on walking around for at least 30 minutes before you even hit the dressing room.  I don't find that their "going out" clothes are too hot, but they have great everyday wear, and even some items you can wear to the office. I was recently surprised to see that some of the stores have added a men's, maternity and plus size section.  I'm currently not in the market for these sections, but it's cool anyway.  Their clothes fit pretty true to size, and unlike H&M you don't have to be a pencil to look good in them.  One thing that I found very strange is they can NOT take anything off the manikins. If you that is the only item left in the size you need, you have to put it on hold until the window display changes (which I believe occurs on Wednesdays), this is challenging because you can't try it on, and you only have 24 hours to pick it up.  Even with their funky" fear of naked manikin" policy, they still get 5 stars for price, 4 stars for selection, and 3 stars for quality!

I have to say that for a chain pet clinic, I've been pretty pleased with the service here. Last year when I got my two poodle puppies, I decided to get the wellness plan through Banfield to save money.  I was a little leery at first because I had several friends turn their noses up at the thought of taking them to a mainstream clinic instead of a private veterinarian office.  I will say it does seem a little more generic and the service is not as personal as you may receive in a private clinic, but they definitely provided me what I needed for my pups.  The staff is extremely friendly and are  excellent about making sure I scheduled all appointments for  shots and services needed for the puppies first year.  In addition, they called and reminded me about all the appointments, and were extremely flexible about changing appointment times and getting me in same day if necessary.  My original plan was to stick with them only through the first year for the puppy plan, and then switch to a private vet, but at this point... I have no reason to leave!

Wow, this place has amazing food!  It is so refreshing to see vegetarian food with variety, flavor and creativity.   I wanted to eat every single thing on the menu, and so did my friend.  We decided to start off with the hummus of the day (Butternut squash), and split two meals, the vegan tacos and the burger of the day (Sweet potato and Mill).  The tacos were filled with a spiced walnut "meat" vegan nacho cheese and sour cream and served in red cabbage cups.  They were soooo good, I would have never thought to use walnuts as meat substitute, brilliant! The burger was another big winner! It had a jalapeño curry sauce that was so flavorful, and it paired nicely with the sweet potato and avocado. On the side were yummy baked fries with homemade barbeque sauce... still licking my lips!  I'll definitely be back, again, and again, and AGAIN!

Go DJ, that's my DJ.... White House is a great place to hit the dance floor to some Hip hop and Pop tunes.  I've been there a couple dozen times since its opening and it continues to improve.  The only downfall is it a little removed from some of the other "clubs" in OT, so you have to commit to it, take a cab or wear comfortable shoes.   The service is excellent all around, the bouncers, bartenders and bathroom attendant are not only friendly, but you can tell they enjoy working there.   They host a lot of "Special parties" most are themed which makes it fun.  The last couple I went to was their beach party and "White Out" party.   It's not as pretentious as the other clubs in Scottsdale, and they are still too new for you to have to wait in long lines for the bathroom or to get a drink.  Don't get me wrong, it's not lacking in style or décor, it's just less "snottsdale" if you know what I mean (Some dress code is enforced though).   There happy hour is just okay, same with the food, not spectacular, not terrible. Give White house a try on a Saturday night after 10PM, so you can get a real feel for what it's all about!

It's hard to not give a place a 4, when they have decent wine priced at $4/glass! It's not the best Thai food I've ever had, but I definitely enjoyed it! We started off with the egg rolls, which were good, and then I had the pumpkin curry with tofu for dinner, which was excellent!  It was a bit spicy, but I was able to cool my mouth off with some yummy pineapple/coconut ice cream afterwards, so not to worry =).  Lao is definitely worth a try, just make sure you emphasize MILD if you are going to try the red curry, because it was kickin!

RnR has potential, my real rating is 2.5   It's a lot like all the other trendy spots in Scottsdale,  neat atmosphere, the staff is full of themselves and they treat people we're lucky to be served by them... but beyond the idiot of a bartender we had, the place wasn't that bad.  I went there for Happy Hour with a friend on Friday and we sat at the bar.  The bartender had no idea what was on HH, although I had checked the menu online on my phone... and he told us the website was wrong.   We both ordered drinks (nothing special )and some appetizers.   I had their veggie tacos and sweet potato fries, they were both excellent.   The tacos are served with jicama instead of a tortilla, brilliant!  My friend had the Ahi tacos and some loaded chips... she thought the Ahi tacos were dry and flavorless.  Both of her items had meat, so I didn't try them.  We ordered another round of drinks about 6:50 before HH ended... he didn't get them to us until about 7:20.  And so the bill comes.... He charged us for 10 drinks (2 of which he charged us full price and 4 that we didn't even order or receive).   So when we mention it to him, thinking he just put someone else's drinks on our tab, he says, "Nope, I didn't even charge you for all the drinks you had!"  What? Seriously, if you served two girls 5 drinks each in less than 2 hours... ONE you should be fired and TWO, we would have been passed out on the floor.   On top of it two of our apps were not priced at HH, but it was only a couple dollar difference, so I didn't feel like dealing with it.  I'll try it again and hope for better service, if not, neither the food nor drinks are that good to be treated like dirt!

I really like the atmosphere of the Vig Uptown,I just wish I could say the same for the food.   It's just not vegetarian friendly.  Yes, they have a greasy vegetable sandwich, and Yes, they can modify many menu items to be vegetarian, but a salad with no protein, is just not exciting.  It really frustrates me when restaurants say, "Well we can do this without the meat..." that may have been acceptable 15 years ago, but NOT when 10% of the US population follow a vegetarian diet!  We like to eat good food too!  Sorry for ranting, but for a new restaurant that portrays a Hip/modern image, they are not living up to it.  I've been to Vig Uptown several times because my BF likes it, but last night he said his potato pancake was not very good and the portion size of his carne continues to decrease every time he orders it.  I will say that the Vig has great sangria, tasty specialty drinks, and I've always had good service.  It's hard to say I won't be back, because that's probably not true... I can say I will not be back for the food!

Let me start by saying that my first trip to Talking stick was initiated by a spontaneous decision to try the new casino, after a day of drinking... Needless to say, about $200 later we decided to call it a night.   Don't get me wrong, we had a great time, just lost money.  I'm not a gambler, so I mainly just played spectator as Hottie lost his money at the blackjack table.  After about an hour, I decided to take my bad luck with me, and wonder around the casino.  I can say, by far this is the best casino in town. It actually reminds of a casino in Vegas!  Not to mention everyone who worked at the Casino was very friendly, in fact since there was a wait for a cab, they just drove us home since we were only a couple miles away.    We will definitely be back to talking stick for the night just to dine and enjoy entertainment at the piano bar without gambling!

I had been going to Fresh and Easy since it opened when I lived in Mesa. When I moved to Scottsdale I was super disappointed that there were none in the area, but now there is!  This is a great market to go to for a quick trip.  It can't replace all your grocery shopping needs, but has some specialty items that I can't live without... such as their hummus, pretzel chips, fresh raviolis and pizza dough.  They also have a nice selection of premade meals that can serve 1-2 people if you're in a hurry.  Overall,  I have been very pleased with all their store brand products.   They also have a decent wine selection that is inexpensive.  The only downside is most of their produce and cold products have a relatively short shelf life.   If you live in the area, they also send out coupons in the mail for $3-5 off your next purchase, you just have to remember  to bring the coupon!

I wish I could tell you more about Primebar, but my group was treated so poorly at the door, we never made it inside.   A group of 15 of us arrived in a party bus on Saturday at 10PM.  The organizer had called in advance and requested to get on the list.  She was told there was no list, but there shouldn't be any problem getting us in before 11.   When we arrived there was a short line (about 5 people), and were told by the bouncers they were at capacity.  This surprised us because there was absolutely no one sitting on the outside patio.  As we discussed the situation with the bouncer they continued to let people in that were behind us, and kept telling us we needed to wait longer. During the 15 minutes we were standing there waiting, they let about 30 people in behind us, and then when we complained they told us we shouldn't have let them get in front of us! What were we suppose to do, protest the line and take out anyone who tried to pass us?  That's what bouncers are for! Needless to say, after it was apparent they had no interest in our business we left.

Sorry Iruna, I can't give you the  "Just opened Pass" anymore.  In an attempt to give Iruna a redemption from our first visit, my hottie and I met up with another couple for "happy hour".  As it turns out,  we were unable to get HH pricing because we were sat at a table inside. We requested outside seating but the host said, "I don't think we have anything outside" If I knew that was going to be a $50 difference in my bill, I would have made him check!   The good:  1. Wine selection 2. Red Sangria  The bad....  1. Pan con Tomato... oops they forgot the tomato, garlic and salt, so I basically got bread! 2. Spinach and goat cheese sticks... burnt once again, I mean even Arby's has mastered frying cheese! 3.  The prices are ridiculous for the small portions and quality.   I don't mind spending  over $100 on a meal for two people and hardly getting any food, if  1) every bite is savory and delicious or 2) if it's a really cool place. Iruna is neither of these! In fact we left , went to RnR and got more food.

Ick and Boo!  My two thoughts after bite one of my take-out dinner.  After eating a lot of average Chinese food in Scottsdale, we were excited to try this new place.  When I called to place my order, I was a little shocked to find out that all but one of the entrees listed in the "Vegetable" dinner section contained some kind of meat or fish product.   So I ordered the only option I had tofu and mixed vegetables in a brown soy sauce, and requested they add cashew nuts.  He informed me that it would be $2, and I said that was fine.  When our food arrived, my dish had no cashew nuts... "Boo", it also had no flavor whatsoever "Ick".  In fact, after taking a few bites, I began to be concerned about the quality of the food, as it was loaded with veggies and sauce, and really had no flavor at all...something was wrong here.   I ate about 5 bites total and threw it away, I didn't want to risk getting sick over it. Hottie did the same and we ate a few pieces of cheese for dinner instead.  Needless to say we won't be back.

I hate to break it to you all... but the long awaiting delivery of an H&M store in Scottsdale, turned out to be a huge disappointment! Ever hear the saying "Good from far, but far from good"?  This pretty much sums it up. The clothes are great for a straight figured person with no curves that only wants to wear their cloths once or twice. Otherwise you are SOL!  There is no quality control whatsoever, except that they are all made cheaply!  The only thing good I can say about H&M is the have cute accessories.

Typically if I leave a place dripping in sweat, and feeling like I got punched in the stomach, I would give it a 1 star rating... but not this time!  Whoa baby, Studiomixx is kicking my butt, and I keep coming back for more! It's hard to describe what makes it such a challenging workout because I can do all the exercises individually and survive no problem.  It's the combination and sequencing of exercises that are unbearable.  I have been going to fitness classes my whole life and consider myself a very fit person, but I have yet (after 6 classes) been able to go through the entire class without taking a quick break. That gives me something to work towards and validates that I am truly challenging my body and getting a great workout.  The best way to describe these classes is Pilates "on crack".  You get an entire body workout, including cardio, core, strength and flexibility training in an hour.  If you didn't think it could get any better, it can.  The studio is in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, it is very clean, and all the equipment is provided for you.  The pricing is a little steep, so unless you're a true "baller" it may be challenging to swing the unlimited monthly fee, but there are several package options available, allowing you to take classes individually at a fairly reasonable rate, which can help distribute the cost.  So, if you're looking to switch up your routine, burn some calories and tone up muscles you didn't know you had... this is the studio for you!

Oh what a blissful experience at Bliss/ReBar!  After a brief visit to rebar on a pub crawl, during which I spent most of the time drooling over the food on the other side of the fence, I've decided to try it out for dinner.   It was a Friday night about 8:30, we were greeted (actually twice), and sat almost immediately.   Our server was very friendly actually sported a personality which was a nice change.  The menu is pretty small, so I won't complain about the number of vegetarian options.  The ratio of vegetarian to non-veggie options was acceptable.  They offered a grilled veggie sandwich, grilled cheese with pear(which you could order without bacon), mac n cheese, several salads and a few appetizers.    Since it was so late, I didn't want to order anything too heavy. I decided on a pesto "cheese crisp" and  1/2 red rocket salad, yes I said it RED ROCKET!   A pleasant surprise was that I could order any salad in a half order, which was a great alternative to just getting a "side salad".     I'll start with the "Cheese crisp"-  fried tortilla sliced into 6 pieces topped with pesto, tomato and fresh mozzarella. -4 Stars.   The salad was also very tasty; it was a fried piece of goat cheese on top of a bed of arugula, with red bell pepper and red onion.  My only complaint is that there were only a few slivers of pepper and onion, so I ended up with a bowl of perfectly dressed arugula.  I made the best of it and added it on top of my cheese crisp... never let arugula go to waste!  My Bf ordered salt and vinegar fries for the table and they were very good, but I actually think they needed a little more seasoning to bring out the vinegar.   In hind sight, if I was eating the entire order it could be overwhelming.  Other orders at the table included a burger and an order of lettuce wraps, I can't speak to either of those as they both contained meat, but the rest of my party seemed pleased.  It all fairness to Bliss, since I didn't order a "real" meal, what they served me was very good and the service was spot on.  Since I about 25 minutes away, I wouldn't make a trip to Bliss just to eat, but I will definitely recommend it for a group dinner in the future.

You had me at the Hibiscus margarita! I rarely give four stars to a restaurant with only one vegetarian option on the menu... but I guess I'll make an exception, for stellar margaritas!  (It's amazing how we are so close to Mexico, and AZ restaurants continue to produce mediocre margaritas and chips and salsa.) Not the case here folks!  So even though the Canteen barely meets 4 star qualifications, they credit to for great for their excellent margaritas and salsa flight.  We obviously started off the meal strong with Chips and Salsa, and Hottie and I both ordered tacos for dinner.  I had the Portobello tacos with blue cheese, and Hottie the battered fish tacos.  Mine were good, except the blue cheese overpowered the Portobello, so I ditched it after the first bite. A more mellow cheese, such as Monterey jack or Fontina would have paired better.  I ordered a side of "smoked" black beans to go with it... these were awful, dry, not smoked whatsoever and they were refried.  I'd rather eat my own arm then be subjected to that nonsense again.  On a positive note Hottie said his tacos were the best he ever had.  The ice cream flights they had for dessert sounded great, but I didn't have room to try them! I'll definitely be back to the canteen for Happy hour...

Goat cheese stuffed ravioli with less than 475 calories??? Yes please!  Seasons 52 is a refreshing change from the typical Giant corporation restaurant.  It still stands out as having a big chain vibe with the large busy restaurant, standard booths and tables , giant portions and fancy host seating machines.  I'm not against big chains, but for the most part I avoid them because they are relatively uninventive and rarely have new menu options.   This is not the case at Seasons 52. The menu changes with the season and the food is portioned appropriately, allowing you to enjoy multiple courses without a guilty conscience.   Our meal started off with tomato flat bread. It was simply an extremely thin crust pizza in the shape of a rectangle. It was okay, but lacked salt.  Next I ordered the soup of the day which was a creamed corn without any cream.  It was incredibly tasty, and I was impressed that they managed to obtain a creamy texture and consistency without cream or milk! For the main course I ordered the goat cheese ravioli served with veggies and a tomato stock.  It was excellent.  It is served as two fist sized raviolis stuffed with herbed goat cheese.  It seemed like a lot of cheese, but when combining it with the vegetables and broth, it was divine! For dessert we tried 3 different mini indulgences: Key Lime pie, Pecan pie, and peanut butter mouse.  Between the two of us we could not agree on a favorite, but they were all fantastic!

Okay, so everyone knows subway makes decent sandwiches for a reasonable price.... But did you know they serve a pretty decent breakfast?  I was sitting in the O'so long drive-thru line for Starbucks and looked in the window for subway and there was no one there!  Since I was running late, I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  For $2.50 I got a coffee and breakfast sandwich with egg whites on a whole wheat English muffin. This same order at starbucks would have been about $8.   Starbucks still trumps with better coffee, but the breakfast sandwich at subway was better than the one I normally get at starbucks, made fresh, and about half the calories.  This was also one of the cleanest subway locations I have ever been to, and the service was great too.

I've never been one to shop at second hand stores, but after one visit to Plato's closet, I've changed my mind! Plato's has a great selection of good quality purses, dresses and tops.  I didn't venture into the pant section since I am 4'11, and likely don't share the same inseam as the rest of the population!  I was in a hurry, so I poked around for a few minutes and managed to snag up two really cute sun dresses, purse and belt... for under $30!  The clothes really were in good condition, I compare it to the clothes in my closet that I have only worn once and neglected since (primarily because I wore them to an event and had a bunch of pics taken).  These clothes are lonely and need some attention!   Next time I'll be bringing my clothes here to do a little exchange.

I decided to give Independence another try because my boyfriend said that it had got much better since they've expanded the space. He was right. It's still nothing fancy, but it's better lit and doesn't make me claustrophobic.   I've been scoping out the trainers over my last few visits and they seem pretty intense. They've got people doing football drills across the gym and throwing boxing bags around! I'm not sure I can handle any of that yet, but it looks like a good workout for sure!

I think I've subconsciously avoided writing this review in hopes that no one else would find my favorite my Manhattan joint... well that didn't work so here goes! Hands down best cocktails in old town, everything from their sangria to their Manhattans are made fresh and it's clear the recipes have been thoroughly tested. Same goes for the food.  We mostly go for the drinks and the reverse happy hour appetizers, but their dinner menu is also superb.  There isn't a huge vegetarian selection, but what they do have is tasty and filling.  Some of my favorites are the kiltlifter fondue, hummus, burrata and kale starter, and the truffle grilled cheese.  I've honestly never made it to dessert because there is never any room. Someday... but as long as they keep up the quality I'll be a CPH superfan for life =)

Let's just say, I was not a fan!  We went here with a group in the middle of the week and we received absolutely terrible service.   It took forever for us to even get greeted let alone water. Then our food came out at all different times which is always awkward because your food gets cold while you wait for everyone else to be served.   Now let's get to the food. I ordered the mac & cheese and a side salad, it was blah! In fact it tasted like processed cheese not even fresh cheese. One of my coworkers ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, and he sent it back because he said it tasted like jarred Alfredo sauce. A few others ordered sandwiches that came with french fries, and they appeared to be happy. So if you stick with the typical diner style food you'll probably be somewhat satisfied.  This is probably a good spot to take children or people with a not-so sophisticated palate!

Eeek... I hate giving bad reviews, but the food was pretty awful.  This is Bonfire's first week open, so hopefully they are just working out the kinks, and it gets better soon.  Hottie and I went for Happy hour and dinner on Friday.  I wasn't thrilled with any of their HH drink specials, so I just ordered one of their specialty martini's with Prosseco and some other yummy goodness! I loved my martini, which is good because I realized they were 11 bucks a pop when I got the bill!  Hottie ordered a Stella on tap, but was served a bud light, they served him another... same thing. I am convinced they had the kegs switched up.   For appetizers we ordered fried pickles (Hottie's choice) and grilled artichoke.  The pickles were dipped in a thick batter similar to that of fish and chips- Ick!  The artichoke was okay, but covered in oil... I mean my hands were dripping.   For dinner Hottie ordered some "Jumbo Prawn" and Andouille Sausage skewer with a side of baked beans.  His "Prawns" were not jumbo and they were obviously shrimp. His food was covered in oil too... I grill a lot at home and you don't need very much oil, that's what's great about grilling!  For dinner, I ordered three sides, truffle and parmesan mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and grilled asparagus.  The asparagus was excellent, the mac n cheese was okay, nothing special, and the potatoes were bland and dry... big disappointment.  To end on a positive note, our service was good, and the concept is fresh, so I suppose we'll be back to give them opportunity for redeem themselves...we'll just give them some time to get on their game!

A friend of mine recently found the B.O.B when we trying to arrange for transportation for a group from Old Town to the big bang on Mill. It was very convenient. We called them about 15 minutes before we wanted to get picked up. They arrived with a huge Orange van (Not bus) and took us right to the Big Bang.  Since then we have used it a couple times, and it has worked out great. Essentially, B.O.B beats a taxi when you have more than 3-4 people, and you are traveling within/between Old Town and Tempe.   The rates are very reasonable too.  If you are within Old Town, it's $2/person, $8 min.  If you go between OT and Tempe you're looking at $3/per person with a $15 minimum.  This is particularly convenient (and cheap) when you take the light rail, and you need a ride back to OT!

Leave no hair behind!  I was pleasantly surprised with my Brazilian last week from Diana.  She is clearly an experienced professional who knows how to make you feel comfortable.    When I arrived (early) she was with a client but came out to greet me and offer me water.  The office is very clean and her room was so peaceful I almost fell asleep waiting for her to come back in.  The service itself was extremely painless, I actually looked down a few times to makes sure she was actually removing hair! She was meticulous, thorough, and friendly all things I look for in an esthetician.  Also her prices are dead on with her competition, which is really a steal for her high quality of work!

Holy Ravioli! Tommy V's is the new place to be for Happy Hour! Of course only if you're a fan of a huge selection of food (small plates) at HH prices, and excellent wines by the glass for $5! I went with a group of 5 girls, we made reservations for 6PM, and despite the Networking event of about 200 people in the bar, we got right in and had superb service. You could tell the entire staff was working as team, which is impressive for a restaurant that has only been open for a couple weeks.  We split a selection of items to get an idea of their menu:  Butternut squash raviolis with sage butter sauce, fried gnocchi with marinara, fig and goat cheese sliders, risotto carbonara and spinach and cheese raviolis (shaped in little hearts)! Everything that I tried was excellent, and I was very impressed with the homemade ravioli's (At least they fooled me if they weren't!) To top it off their bread was amazing, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, served with some sort of herb infused olive oil.  They did a great job converting the old Café Carumba into an urban yet sophisticated lounge, the patio is huge ... and has comfortable seating(Well once summer is over)! This is definitely my new "Go To" Happy hour spot for a date with my Hottie, or a drink with my girls =)

There is nothing remarkable about this strip mall nail salon, but they do a nice job and the salon is very sanitary.  You can schedule an appointment, but one is not necessary... they encourage walk-ins.  The deluxe pedicure is worth every penny.  The five minute foot massage and hot stone rub was awesome, especially after a long run.   This is my new go-to nail salon for a last minute mani or pedi.

Brenna was great! This was my first spray tan and it was the day before my wedding reception (yes I'm balsy). Since nobody had anything bad to say about Brenna I decided to go for it, and I'm glad I did! The color was perfect not orange at all... Just right for February! She also took time to explain what to expect and how to maintain the color for longer. I will definitely go back if I'm in need of a quick tan again!

I have to say, this place is so convenient and has great customer service.  I've now stopped in twice and was helped out immediately. Which includes helping me lift my 65lb bike in and out of my car.  I have my own bike, but the rented bikes appear to be in good condition, and based on the service I received I would believe that they are well maintained.  They also carry a wide variety of accessories for your bike that are reasonably priced and fashionable.    This is definitely my new go-to stop for beach cruiser maintenance and bling!

After at least a dozen visits to O.H.SO, I just realized I never reviewed it. Maybe I subconsciously didn't want to endorse this Arcadia gem because I was hoping no one would find it... Well that plan didn't work! Here are the reasons I love O.H.S.O 1.  Brunch: $10 for entrée and a beer (Or mimosa) 2. Dog friendly patio: Plenty of water and dog hooks near the table, so the pooches can enjoy the day too.   3. Beer Selection:  I'm not a huge fan of beer, but I they have a great selection of draft beers and plenty of fruity girly options (which is what I'll drink).    As a vegetarian, I have been very pleased with their menu, trying everything from the breakfast grilled cheese (minus the meat), O.H.S.O Rita flat bread pizza to the Yucca chips and have been very satisfied.  This location is also pretty big, so it's great spot for large parties.

If you love pickles you'll love Old Town whiskey. We've been here twice so far, and both times, we've been very pleased.  So far, I've only tried their pickled beets and pickled cherry tomatoes, but both were absolutely fantastic.  The Cherry Tomatoes were so sweet and sour, they paired perfectly with the ricotta, olive tapenade and Crustini they were served with.  This place is a gold mine if you're a whiskey drinker, my hottie loves some good whiskey and was really impressed with their selection... not to mention he said the burger was probably the best he'd had.  I can't wait to get a taste of their Veggie burger, but I haven't gone hungry enough yet... Next time for sure!  We went for Happy Hour this past Friday, and they had a lovely Agave Fizz cocktail on special, very refreshing.  Their Happy hour is progressive, meaning that everything is $5 from 5-6, $6 from 6-7, and it runs every day.

Holy guacamole!  We have anticipating the opening of Chef Jose Garces Mexican restaurant, and were not disappointed.   Let's start with the food: A-  Chips and Guacamole: A+    Clearly made fresh and seasoned perfectly.    Salsa: B-     I mean we ate it but it was pico style and nothing special  Vegetarian mushroom dish (Name?): A+    Mushrooms, truffle oil and cheese on top of a delicious homemade corn flatbread... highlight of the night!   Arroz Con Crema: A+   Creamy rice with poblano peppers, it tasted like a savory rice pudding, A-Maz-Ing  Tres Leches: B   The cake itself was a little dry, which is very surprising because it was supposed to be a moist cake, the only reason this dessert gets a B is because the coconut sorbet was heavenly!  Hottie, also ordered shrimp and chorizo tacos, brisket, and pulled pork tacos.  He appeared to really enjoy these, but being a vegetarian, I didn't taste them.     Drinks: A  House Margarita: A+   Perfect flavor, not too sweet or sour.    Jeff Margarita: B-   Hottie ordered this and it was not nearly as good as the house Margarita. Clearly not worth the extra $4  Milagro Tequila Flight: A   But really was not necessary ; )  Service:  A- Overall we had very good service; they were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  What really through us off was the servers were wearing T-shirts, which was strange because even the bussers were wearing long sleeve collard black shirts.  It really looked unprofessional (Not their fault of course).    Ambiance: C+ I'm sorry but I didn't like the design inside, it was a mess.  The tables were a combination of picnic and princess glitter.  The whole place was confusing, busy and distracting.  They really missed the mark on this one. Although they have a great patio, which is where we will choose to sit once it warms up a bit.    Overall, we had a great meal, and we'll be back. We are actually looking forward to trying them out for brunch soon.

Well the super secret door by the dumpster behind the restrarant leads you to tiny room with pretty impressive coctails.  Be prepared to wait, at the bottom of the stairs, at the door and once you get in.  The service is not fast, this is not a place you go for quick drinks or with someone who can't hold a conversation.  It is a place to go if you want to try one of a kind, handmade cocktails!

After 3 trips to Brat Haus, I finally feel good about reviewing it.  Here is the breakdown:   The Good:   1. Service- Every time we went there it was busy and we received very good service and our servers were knowledgeable about the beer.  Speaking of beer:  2. Beer- Hands down best beer selection in Old Town! They also make a killer Moscow Mule =)  3. Belgiun Fries- Come on, trice fried fries... how can you go wrong! I also love all their sauce options.   4. The atmosphere- Perfect spot in Old Town, especially now that it is cooling down.  I also love the graffiti mural on the wall, the owner said they will be randomly having local artist paint the wall. Great idea!   The forgettable:   1. Pretzel - its okay, nothing special, I was expecting it to knock my socks off... they stayed on!  2. Vegan- While I am very grateful of them having a vegan option, it was tasty but very hard to eat because it kept falling apart... they need to work on making a vegan brat!   My friends love this place, so we'll be back for sure.  One day I'm going to try their nutella shake... or steal their giant container of Nutella... Mmmmm!

This is by far some of the best popcorn I've ever had! I ordered some for a wedding sweet and salty bar, and let's just say it was a hit! I sampled at least 20 kinds before narrowing it down to 3 that I thought appealed to all. Ranch, salted Carmel and beer cheddar. I highly recommend!!!

What a fun way to spend my Hump day! Thanks to Mood Swings for giving us a little taste of the salon and hosting all of us crazy yelpers. I really enjoyed learning about the product and am looking to going back in a couple weeks for a facial.    Oh, and best goodie bag of the year, Free Aveda products? Yes, Please!

Surprisingly very good spot for breakfast! We were poking around Yelp, looking for a place out the Old Town chaos, and realized we had never been to Seven's Bistro so we gave it a try.  They had a very unique menu for breakfast, and tons of vegetarian options. I have to mention that their coffee was particularly delicious as well. I had a breakfast combo with jalapeño cheese sauce and corn on my eggs... mmmmm! Then we split a single order of their lemon ricotta pancake... next time I might just order one of those, it was awesome...almost more on the savory side. We will definitely be back for breakfast and I would even like to give their happy hour a try too. Their menu looks great!

One of the worst breakfast experiences ever!     The service was extremely slow and my food came out rubbery and cold. But that probably had something to do with the fact that it sat up on the counter for five minutes... Which we watched happen. Not only did several servers walk by our food with the ticket ready and keep walking but so did the manager, twice!  Finally, since we were in a rush we went and found the server standing at the hostess stand and told her our food was ready.  My friends French toast was cold so she had to send it back. Unfortunately, I had some place to be so I just didn't eat my food, I sent it back. My eggs were rubbery and brown and my hashbrowns (which I ordered extra crispy) were cold and not crispy.  The manager was a jerk, when we complained he walked over and said "you guys are complaining already ha ha Ha..." . He was unprofessional, never came over and apologized, and we watched him touch his face at least 10 times while he was expediting food. Ewww! He should not be running a restaurant, this is the reason this place is a disaster and gets terrible reviews on yelp. Luckily all was not lost because I was in good company!   My advice, wait the extra time for the breakfast club or go to McDonald's you have a way better experience either way.

Yay! I am so happy America's Taco Shop has finally opened in Old Town! There are no good Mexican spots nearby, so this is really a treat. This is an order at the counter style restaurant, so it's nothing fancy, but they have a great patio and solid food.  Their guacamole is made fresh, and the Vegetarian bean and cheese burrito is excellent. Did I mention they have some of the best tortillas around? Oh, and the patio appears to be dog friendly too!!

This place is great for lunch! The sandwiches are made fresh and the sides are delicious.  I ordered a #45 (Very similar to a caprese style sandwich), all the ingredients were put into a pita style bread, it didn't taste like pita, it tasted like bread if that makes sense.  Then the sandwich was pressed and heated. It was very tasty. My only complaint is that it was a little small. I easily finished it, and I rarely finish my food.  They have several sides to choose from, she gave me two so I could try them both. One was the kale salad the other was a chickpea salad... both were super flavorful. In fact, I next time I might see if they will put the chickpea salad in the bread and grill that up! Obviously, I plan on going back =)

Pomegranate wheat beer, yes please!  This is a great little brewery, and a very chill spot to hang out.  I'll warn you they don't have food, but you can bring your own or order from one the local restaurants for delivery.  I would definitely recommend you do the tasting flight. It's a great price and you can try a selection of beers.   Then if you're still thirsty you can pick your favorite beer to order.  Looking forward to my next visit, and hoping to see this sold in AZ liquor stores soon!!

I rarely give a 5 star review, but I honestly couldn't find anything wrong this place! From the menu to the service, we were kept happy during a busy lunch hour on a Friday.  I met a friend for lunch, (during  office hours) so I couldn't try any of their drinks, but their pizza selection was so intriguing that I didn't even care.  I went simple and boring...  a margherita pizza with green olives, but I thought I would see if they could get the basics right before moving on.. . They nailed it! Probably the best I've had in a really long time.  My lunch date had a "Abbey" Style beer which she enjoyed (Yes, right in front of me ! It's okay Mandi B. I still love you=D) and the Brussels sprout pizza with arugula and prosciutto.  She said it was delicious.  After I ordered, I smelled and saw all of these wonderful concoctions of pizza, roasted corn and salads... none of which I ordered.  I don't regret my order, but can't wait to go back and try something new.  Maybe Sweet potato and arugula pizza? Stay tuned...

Naturally on my first visit to a bar, I start with a Manhattan, it's a test to see if they employee "real" bartenders... good news, they do! The Manhattan was perfectly mixed and they even used my favorite figgy pudding bitter which is a rarity since it just started being sold.  We were off to a good start, not quite friends, but acquaintances.  Next up appetizers, we chose the ricotta gnocchi in a chevre and mushroom broth.... Okay, P&P now we're friends!  For my entrée, I chose the house made vegan burger. It was just okay, a little bland.  It needed spice or salt or something.  The fries were good though.  Now it's time to tell you why P&P might be my new BFF... Homemade nutella icecream topped with salted carmel and home made marshmallows served with a chocolate chip cookie... seriously amazing!   Overall, P&P is great place for us Southdale locals to hang out and get good grub.  I do hope they frequently change up the menu though, because as a vegetarian I have a feeling I'll get bored with my 2 options quickly!

With only one visit under my belt, I can't rave about this place, but I will say it's definitely better than average. Which is why it barely gets 4 stars....    The vegetarian options were pretty slim, but they did have a very tasty mushroom quesadilla, and I really enjoyed the chips, salsa and guacamole. I just wish the chips and salsa was complementary.  Unfortunately, with only one vegetarian option, it doesn't entice me to keep coming back. This really is too bad, because we live right around the corner.  Hottie said his spare rib taco was delicious but the carne asada was just so-so.    We are huge fans of all the Uncle Sals concepts, their food and service is always good. This is no exception. The Blind Pig has great potential, despite the fact that it didn't blow our minds on the first try!  The only thing I don't understand is how the butcher shop ties in with the Mexican menu.   What to expect?  Well like Side Door, it's more of a neighborhood bar feel, nothing fancy.  It will be packed on a weekend night, so prepare to sit at the bar, outside or wait. It's a very small place.

Please keep in mind that is review is only based on cocktails and service. Which were both fantastic! In an attempt to buy some time before heading out for a night on the town, we stumbled open this unique lounge with fancy scratch cocktails. I ordered a bourbon drink that was spelled similar to paparazzi ... It was topped off with charred star anise and it was boosting with flavor.  A lot of thought went in to developing this recipe and a lot of care into making it! Much appreciated ;-)

Great fried pickles!   So as a vegetarian, the veggie dog is pretty disappointing. It's so small, it gets lost in the toppings and the naan. They really need to find an alternative. If they had a better veggie dog, the concept is fun so I would probably have given them a 5 star review.   Other than the dog, their fried pickles were awesome, and we had great service. I also indulged and had an orange glazed pistachio donut.... AMAZING!

Cute little place with a dog friendly patio!   Stopped in for breakfast with the poodles, and they were happy to greet all the guests and sniff the rosemary bushes. Okay back to the restaurant, here's the breakdown:   1.   Specialty French toast - cinnamon raisin: A+ 2.  Roasted tomato and feta omelette:  B+ (it needed a sauce of some sort on top)  3. Coffee:  Took a few minutes but it was fresh drip: A 4. Service: slow but very nice: B+ 6. Atmosphere: nothing fancy, but cozy and casual!: A   Overall, I definitely go back for breakfast,  there are few things that weren't "spot on" but it was a good experience and good food.

This is a solid lunch choice for Midtown. I was a little disappointed to find out that there were no lunch specials when I went in, because I heard they had some great lunch deals... but I was still happy to  pay full-price for my meal.  To start I ordered a side Caesar salad with their house made ranch instead of Caesar dressing (which was not vegetarian).  The salad was pretty basic, nothing to brag about... but the pizza made the meal better! Not feeling in the mood for truffle oil, I ordered the Fungi pizza with pesto instead. It was very good, flakey crust and just the right amount of cheese and sauce, the fresh arugula on top made it taste "healthier" too =).  If you're on your lunch break, plan ahead.  The pizza takes about 20 minutes to cook, which they kindly warn you about on the menu.  Overall it was a very nice experience, the staff was very attentive and the food was good, so I'll be back!

4 stars for food... 3 stars for service!   I finally got myself here to give it a try. It was definitely worth it, there were plenty of options that were vegetarian and even vegan friendly.   There was a group of us, so we had to wait to be seated until we all arrived. That was not that atypical so we weren't shocked when they asked us to sit at the bar and grab a drink.  The bartender was very friendly, and made a pretty good Mule. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I really like my mules served and a chilled metal container... The glass jug wasn't quite doing it for me. Especially since we sat outside it got warm quick.   Once we set down at the table, the mediocre service really kicked in. It took almost 15 minutes to even get greeted, and then the server appeared to be in a rush the entire time.    For dinner I ordered a Greek salad to start, a vegetarian pot pie pasty, and a broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake on the side.  No, of course I did not finish it all, but I wanted to have a little taste of a few things instead of just one pasty. Everything was very good. I was so excited to see that they serve quorn in their pasty's. It is my favorite vegetarian meat substitute, because it is not sit based.  Overall, despite the week service I definitely think will be back. It was a great selection, good portions and a really neat atmosphere. Great for groups.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this Hula's, but after attending their grand opening I was pleasantly surprised.  Despite being extremely busy, we had great service and food. I tried the house made vegetarian black bean burger with sweet potato fries. It was excellent and big enough to feed at least 2 people! The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was their drinks were premixed.  The Mai Tai was a little sweet for my taste, so I asked them to take down the pineapple juice a bit, but they couldn't...so I moved on to  a dark and stormy.   We're looking forward to returning for Sunday brunch and all day happy hour... let's just say Hula's is going to be packed this spring!

No thank you!   This was a disappointing experience.  If it wasn't terrible service place potential because the food was decent. Unfortunately we had to ask for water four times... and My husband never got any.    We stopped in for happy hour on Saturday, because of the sign on the street advertising it. We waited forever to be greeted at the table and then we're never actually assigned a server. So not only did we receive terrible service , the bill came and no happy hour pricing... When we asked about it, they said it was just Mon-Fri ... Then we let them know that the sign didn't say that, so they did look at the sign and honor it.     We might give them another shot if they are still around in a couple months.

This was such a fun event! So many yelpers brought their pups and they were all very well behaved.  The poodles, surely had a doggy hang over the next day from all the excitement.  Guinness refuses to take of his yelp bandana... so it's still on!   A big thanks to our host for the event, Lori Landis for opening up her studio to us crazy yelpers and our four legged friends. It was a  beautiful spring evening, so it was nice that we could spend time inside and outside during the event.  I didn't try too much of the food since I'm a vegetarian, but the mac and cheese was pretty tasty and as usual the sprinkles cupcakes were delicious.

Poorly set up for the super Bowl. Forgot our food, lost our drinks and then closed the bathrooms while we waited 45 minutes to get our check... Never again!!!

Amazing, moist and delectable little creations! I ordered a mix of bundtini's to take on a girls trip last week, and these mouth-watering treats did not stand a chance!  We devoured all 12 of them in no time.  The dozen came with a mix of flavors allowing me to experience heaven in my mouth, again, again and again!  My favorite was the white chocolate raspberry with white chocolate frosting, although the lemon was also superb.  While waiting to pick up my box, I also had the opportunity to try a (few) samples of the blueberry cake with white chocolate frosting, it was like a blueberry muffin, but soooo much better!  If you can't tell by the over use of exclamation points in my review, this place is a Must! Must! Must try!
