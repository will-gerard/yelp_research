Love, love, love this place. I have never ordered anything I did not like. Their chicken Caesar pasta salad is the best!

If I wanted a sleezy salesman, I would have gone to a used car lot. But that's what I get for getting my first detail and not doing research. 200 dollars for a detail and buffing out scratches (that didn't need to be buffed out, because they are clearly still visible)   I told the guy, Trip (after he upsold me on an unnecessary added extra), I could not wait a couple hours and that I would just have to come back another time. He said he could get it done in an hour and a half. Well, he must've actually meant 4 hours, because that is how long it took. The extra star is for the front desk, they were very understanding and empathetic to the situation. Definitely irritated enough not to go back though.

Tried this place out for lunch today, overall good experience! I had the southwest and my boyfriend had the patagonia. The patagonia was a little bland, but mine was good!   Also, if you are watching calories be mindful of the grains, I was surprised when I saw how many my meal had! I definitely want to go back a get one of their juices!

Love this place. Keith said that if I buy 15 juices, he would do a lap around the complex in his undies. And he did! Try it out.
