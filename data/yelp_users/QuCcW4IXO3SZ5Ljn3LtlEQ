If you want the BEST repair shop in Phoenix, no wait, Arizona, no wait, the entire free world, don't hesitate in using Alexander's!   I spent a boat load for a recent repair on my convertible and Alexander's was above and beyond being honest, reputable and knowledgeable.  It was one of the best shop experiences I have ever had.  The repair would have been costly no matter where I took my car, but Alexander, Oscar and the complete staff made this expense a comfortable one knowing I was not being ripped off.  I know they have forever earned my business as well as referrals.  And as a bonus . . they actually cleaned my disgusting dirty car!  THEY ARE AMAZING!

Belsito is so amazing!  I have used them several times now and they are just the best to work with!  Always on time, always very courteous, and they get the job done right!  I don't even have to consider whom I'm going to call if I have an issue!  Belsito every time!

Since their opening way back when, Postino's is still one of my most favorite casual hang outs.  Love the patio, awesome food but the staff here makes it one of a kind!

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !  I had a very small move, no boxes, small items etc.  There was only the larger heavy items, 2 refrigerators, washer and dryer, heavy pottery and stone pieces, king and queen mattress, 2 upholstered chairs, a few antique pieces and so on.  I checked Yelp for ratings and saw Arizona Brothers had a good rating/reviews and their estimate was one of the lower ones, so I set the appointment.  I wasn't getting the keys for the new home until 9 am that morning so I set the moving time for that time.  They showed up at 8:10 as I was leaving to meet my realtor.  Ron and Robert seemed like nice guys and I do have to say they worked hard and quickly.   They were in done in a couple of hours so I paid them their $375 plus a $45 tip and was happy with the process at that moment . . . until I started to examine the items that were moved.  EVERYTHING fabric, mattress and especially the new upholstered chairs were all stained.  I have a 300 year old apothecary chest which had it's drawers filled with small items was turned on its side instead of being lifted.  Several irreplaceable items were broken and lost.  There was a 9 foot custom made industrial metal table with a 1" glass top which they chipped the corner off the glass, and that was after I offered to move the glass in my own vehicle.    I was going to let this go as a lesson learned and move on, but the cost to replace that 1" thick custom shaped 9 foot piece of glass alone is astronomical not to mention getting everything else cleaned and of course the items that can't be replaced, so I just wanted to put my experience out there since it was the reviews that helped me make my decision on whom to hire.

What a fun great place to find unusual casual clothing for men and women . . plus a nice beer or wine while you shop doesn't hurt!
