They are amazing. Some of us all know what it's like to work all day everyday and never have time to do laundry or let alone make it to a dry cleaners on time. So sometimes it all piles up, and before you know it you have nothing to wear to work! But on multiple occasions they hooked it up when I brought my bag of dry cleaning 2 hours before I had to work and had it done in time for me to come back change and get to work! They rock!  Staff is always so friendly, and they do a great job with the press! I'm pretty anal about having creases, but they make it look like it just came off the rack at the store! I bring high dollar dress shirts and pants there and can be assured that when I get them back I won't have a single blemish or rip or anything wrong with them! ALL IN ALL!! EVERYTHING ROCKS WITH THEM!   -Andrew Caccia

I cant not explain to you how incredible this Dealership is. From my sales man, Bruce Kotlicky, to the incredible service department all the way to the huge selection of new and pre owned cars! I went there with the intentions of just looking, Bruce introduced him self to me and found out exactly what i was looking for. I was not to familiar with BMW and he broke it down in the simplest way for some one who does not sell the cars to under stand. After 5 minutes of talking about what I wanted in a new car he brought me over to exactly what i was looking for! I fell in love with it right away! Bruce was the most friendly honest and knowledgeable guys out there. He played no games and was up front and honest with everything he told and promised me. I got a great deal up front with no games! Thank you Bruce and for the rest of the staff at BMW Chapman! You all rock!
