I have to say, these may very well be the best Paczki I've had since moving from the midwest. When it's Fat Tuesday and you've missed your Polish family's food for the past year and you learn about this place, it's like finding a hidden piece of heaven. The family at Europa is super friendly and seem very pleased to see anyone come into their shop. I will most definitely be going back to try more of their wonderful food in the near future.

I've only ever tried their delivery, seeing as my lunch break usually isn't at a convenient time to go try and make a store visit. The meals are decent, but a bit salt packed. Very large portions, but also very pricey. If you want a quick delivery for decent food, call them up. Otherwise, look elsewhere.

Everyone at Emission Express is absolutely wonderful. I was in a major state of distress when my fuel pump on my 2002 Chevy S10 decided to kick the bucket (right around the corner from this shop), and they were the absolute best to me. I worked mostly with Tony, who was so nice, helped calm me down, and really made sure I was taken care of.   Great/Fair pricing, really great workforce, just a nice crew all around.  I absolutely recommend these guys to anyone who needs car repair, and it's also worth noting that they do have their own Tow Truck!

This location is pretty great! The worst part is the wait, which in my personal experience can be about an hour and a half. Once you're in the door though, the wait proves to be worth it. The entire staff is super friendly and sociable.   The food is spectacular - worthy of five stars, and everything on the menu that I've tried to date (which is most of it) has been perfectly prepared.  This is a great place for a date or an outing with friends, and has my highest recommendation. Just be ready to wait to get in, though.

Found this place on accident, and I think I just had a life changing experience. This is some of the best food I've ever had, in my life.  I had a pulled pork sandwich, Mac and cheese, cornbread with honey butter, and a few bites of my friend's sweet potato pie. Everything is absolutely heavenly.  Please, please do your self a favor and try this place out. It's worth whatever wait you may have standing in line.

I was a little hesitant to come here after reading through some very mixed reviews, but I was very happily surprised at the amazing service and food!   My girlfriend and I came here on a Friday night around 5pm, just heading into the dinner rush. There was absolutely no wait, we were seated immediately, and taken care of promptly.   The bruschetta was just fantastic, and the basket of bread that accompanies every meal was just soft enough. I got a custom Stromboli, pepperoni with fresh garlic, motz cheese and their spaghetti sauce. It was delicious! Cooked just right, and not so hot that it scalded my mouth, not so cold that it was unappetizing. My girlfriend got the Chicken Scarpara and tells me she enjoyed it. The sauce had an unexpected, but not unwelcome, kick of heat.   I also had a cup of their Italian Wedding Soup. While I'm quite biased, my family makes our own IWS that is to die for, their wedding soup was quite good! My only hope would be that you get more meatballs in the bowl size.  The only thing that was slightly off par was the gelato. It just seemed off to me, too much like normal ice cream, but it was still enjoyable.  The service here is, as I mentioned, fantastic. Both our server, Cody, and our bus-girl Shannon were extremely attentive and friendly. I spoke with the manager on shift as well, who's name I unfortunately didn't catch. He was just wonderful, and seemed to truly appreciate our business at the store.   The facility itself is nice and small, and not too loud. We ate indoors and it was nice, and the patio looks just as great. The restrooms are some of the nicest I've seen, and very well maintained.  Overall, I think VinciTorio's absolutely deserves the 5/5, in all regards.

Update as of 7/3/2013, also known as my 21st birthday.  Tonight was amazing. I make it no secret that VinciTorio's is probably my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona, so I had high expectations coming in with my parents and girlfriend for my birthday. I was not let down.  The bruschetta was as fantastic as before, and everyone agreed on that. My first ever adult drink was their Cardoni (I believe, as I'm now home writing this review trying to remember, ha!) I got the mushroom soup as my dinner starter and was blown out of the water. It was honest to god some of the best soup I've ever had in my life.  I had the Chicken Saltimbocca (again, guessing at names here, my Yelp app was updating) and it was very good! I can recommend it to anyone who likes Chicken and Prosciutto;D  Our waiter was the nicest of nice and extremely attentive. When we ordered dessert he discretely spoke to my father, and ended up arranging the sweetest thing (as again, it's my 21st birthday) On the plate of my dessert was Happy 21st Birthday written out in the chocolate sauce, with a cute little candle sticking out of my dessert! To top that, the local singer/guitar player who was there tonight (who's name I'm hoping I can find, as she was wonderful) sang me a beautiful happy birthday.  I will forever be happy with VinciTorio's, they've treated me, my friends, and my family excellently all 4-5 times I've been, and can honestly say I will miss this place should I ever move.  Do yourself a favor and have a lunch or dinner here sometime. It's absolutely worth it.

Some of the worst customer service you will ever receive. Do not go here unless it is an absolute emergency, and even then try to find someplace else. The worst, the worst, THE WORST! There is ONE employee who is actually helpful, an older gentleman, no one else will feel compelled to help you at all. DO NOT SHOP HERE!

Really great food, the chefs know what they're doing and know how to make teppan yaki fun. Our chef was a younger guy and had a good time letting people have sake squirts and flipping food into people's mouths. It was a blast!! Will definitely come here again, next time with a large group.

The food was good, the service was quick, the place was pretty empty, and the staff were nice! When I'm back at the Rio again, I'll definitely catch another bit to eat here.

Republic Ramen (or as I tend to say - Ramen Republic) is a great little place if you're looking for a huge serving of fantastic food for decently cheap. The staff is very friendly, and your food is prepared to exactly how you want. They've got a pretty great variety of soups and add ins, and lots of neat drinks too. I frequently come here with a large group of my friends, and they're always happy to serve us, which is a nice change of pace from restaurants that groan at large groups.  Overall, great little place with a fun, relaxed atmosphere. A definite visit is needed if you're in the area.

My review is almost a year late now, but I have to say it was phenomenal. Both movers were super friendly and very careful with all of mine and my partner's belongings, and went so quickly! They are absolutely reliable, and if you need movers absolutely hire Creative Moving!!   I move again in November, and you can bet I'll be calling them about assisting me again!!  *edited for spelling mistakes. whoops!
