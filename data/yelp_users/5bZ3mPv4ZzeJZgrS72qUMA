It was a bad experience.  We walked in and it s freezing inside.  The salsas, even though they say are fresh were more like tomato sauce instead of spicy salsas. The tables were dirty.  The service was "where".  The condiment table was dirty. Don't have their enchiladas, it tastes like tomato powder.  I thought it would be better!!

OMG, we have been coming to San Tan for years,  and has always been a great place.   We have brought friends and family knowing they would be taken care of. Today we showed up around 6:30 pm.  I ordered my standard mojito,  had to send it back once.  They brought it back and it had no sweetness to it,  I walked up to the bar,  where a manager,  Tim, asked me what was wrong,  after telling him about my drink,  he proceeded to tell me if I wanted it sweet,  "there is sugar at the table"  OMG, Really?!,!  This is not the service I'm accustomed think getting here!
