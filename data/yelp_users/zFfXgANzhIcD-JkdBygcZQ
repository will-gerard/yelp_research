I went here once with a friend.  We had the lunch buffet which was average.   Until, I saw two cockroaches crawling around. Not, even your normal cockroaches but, gigantic cockroaches.  I couldn't eat anymore but, for some odd reason my other friend did.

I love this place. I've traveled throughout Mexico quite a bit and can say these are the most authentic tacos I've had in Phoenix.  You can even order a michelada.  Yum yum yum.

I love love love my hair cut. It was my first time ever getting compliments from strangers on my hair. I am not the type to spend time getting ready and Elena cut my hair so I don't have to. Love her too.

I don't understand the negative reviews. Every time I go to Bravo salon, I feel immediately comfortable and at ease. Yes, it is a small salon but I have never felt that the small size interfered with my experience. Everyone is incredibly friendly and sincere. Elena always cuts my hair with a new style and creative vision. I always walk out with the best haircut I've ever had.

Sorry Amy P. this place is bum city. It used to be a family favorite. Now, the lines are forever, food portions are lacking and coffee refills are denied. Won't waste my time again.

Plaid used to be delicious...  Now, they got rid of the veggie dumplings and have slow waiters.   Oh well, now everyone goes to Green-which is actually way better than post-plaid.

This place sucks.   I have seen a few bands here. The sound quality sucks and the shows are expensive. Why? I wondered the whole time because its cheap...they have concrete floors, horrible bouncers, and a lame patio with broken plastic seating.   Oh and for parking just walk across the bridge park in the public parking lot. They rip you off.   Drinks are a rip too.   and for the most part crap bands play here.

Delicious.  Best fries probably ever.   and desert is a must. imagine a mix of vegan icecream with cocopuffs but magically the coco puffs do not become soggy..  Don't get the pizza. yu-ck.

Everybody raves about this place.   But, come on...the food is not that great-  over-priced greasy bar food.  And the crowd-please it's horrible. Just because a lot of people go there doesn't make it amazing.   The only pro is it is a great place for big groups and it has a pretty nice patio.   But, its impossible to get a table.

So, I went because of all the hype. Immediately, realized how overrated it was. The ambiance is like a Chilis but trying to be mexican.

I like this place for all of the reasons listed previously.   It's just a nice place to hang out with friends.  Theres also a rumor that George W. went there on his last visit to Arizona.

I've been to lots of yoga studios around phoenix and this is by far my favorite. It has such an intimate and inviting atmosphere. Also, the classes are great and not jam packed with students. The perfect yoga studio all around.

Love this store. Some of it is pretty pricey but, if you  dig around you can find some cute deals. Definitely can't afford the kids stuff though. $60 per outfit geesch.

Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch.
