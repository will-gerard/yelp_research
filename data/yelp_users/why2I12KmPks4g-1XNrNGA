3.5. It was very quiet when we went, no dancers or band. The food and service were great- the one exception being the salad. It had too much dressing. The feta was delish- very subtle.  I had the moussaka- it was very tasty! Decent portions size, along with potatoes and vegetables. They are not stingy with the bread either, which is a rarity. My companion had the chicken with lemon and artichoke, it was good, but I preferred my moussaka. Would I go back? Absolutely. But next time, Id like to see the dancers!

We came here for their Easter buffet and it was delicious. All the food was good, a rarity for a buffet, usually they're hit or miss. The ham with apple compote was soo good, and their grilled veggies were so flavorful....I'm drooling thinking about it. This place is far for me, but I will be back for another buffet, its worth the trip!

The only reason I am downgrading this place is because they have done some weird merger with First Watch and most of The Good Eggs menu is gone. I liked their menu, they had a lot of variety. I couldn't even find an omelet I wanted on the new one. It was disappointing. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly, but I'm bummed all the good food choices are gone.

Came here for New Years Eve and the burlesque show. It was a really great time. This place is a total dive bar, but I like my bars divey. The burlesque show was very good, very funny and the room is small enough where most seats are good seats.  This has been mentioned in other reviews, but the Boom Boom Room (where the burlesque show is) is quite small. So get there early unless you want to sit in the back.  The crowd was lively and fun. I had no problems with the service either, everyone was really great.  There isnt much around here though, I don't live in Vegas, so I couldn't tell you whats even close. Its like a totally random business area.   I wish they had the show more then once a month tho! :(

Came in for breakfast after reading all the + reviews and I have to say, I was not disappointed. I had the white flannel and it was DELISH, I ate almost all of it!! I also had the hot chocolate, it was perfect on a chilly morning. My friend had the berry pancakes, I tried them with the special syrup they bring and they were very tasty, I might try them for myself next time we go.  Yes, it is hard to find, but well worth the frustration of getting there, I shall return!!

This place is in a time warp, but it's awesome. The menu itself is antiquated BUT IN A WAY THAT I LOVE. You get this delicious banana bread with cream cheese dressing when you order a salad. Its delish!! I have also had a turkey salad sandwich and a tuna one on two separate occassions. I really enjoyed the turkey salad sand, the tuna was ok. Friendly service.

People!!! They take debit cards now, so you can continue on with your fear of cash money. I love the retro feel of this place. The dining area is a tight squeeze so leave your claustrophobia at the door. The dutch baby is yum and their omelettes are fluffy and delicious. If you don't want to wait, I suggest coming on a weekday, it's pretty mellow then.

I like this place...I come here at like, 0300 and get tacos or nachos. I'm a night owl so I love me a place that's open 24/7. The food is pretty typical of our local 24 hour Mexican drive thrus. The menu is pretty extensive. Breakfast is available 0600-1100. Generous portions and not so greasy that it hurts your gut later. My go-to middle of the night spot!

Some locals took me here 6 years ago. I am now a religious Double Down-er. I schedule a full "Double Down Day" each time I come to Vegas.  This is THE best bar in Vegas, hands down. The bartenders have great stories, the locals are friendly and fun and there is a tattoo parlor across the street. What could be better?? The cabbies are always scared for you when they drop you off, which only adds to the allure of this dark, dirty place. I love to come here during the day and leave when it gets dark, at least I think thats when I leave, who really knows?? The Double Down owns part of my heart!!

Came in on a Sunday. There was a short line to order, but lots of space to sit. They have a patio in the back too if the weather is tolerable. Their menu is small-ish, but everything sounded good. I decided on the chicken salad sandwich and my companion decided on the cinnamon swirl french toast.  YUM!! I have no complaints about this place. The service was fast and friendly, the prices were reasonable, if not on the cheaper side. The place is clean and pleasing to the eye. Parking is not a problem, either.  I will definitely be back!

My friend and I went to this place over the weekend. We ordered nachos, taquitos, carne asada and a combination plate. The servers were very nice, but the service itself was quite slow. It took about 20 minutes from the time we ordered until we got the apps and then another 25 minutes from then for our meals.  The food was very bland. It made me sad because the presentation was nice, so I was sure it would  be flavorful, but I was disappointed.  I would recommend this place only for drinks and maybe chips and salsa. Everything was kinda boring.

Came here on new years eve because I wanted to see their gluten free menu. Im newly diagnosed with celiac disease so Ive been on the hunt for places to eat.  I tried their GF grilled artichokes and holy crap were they delicious. Seasoned well with a yummy aioli sauce. Seriously would make a trip way the hell up north just to eat those again.  For my entree I had the GF burger. Unfortunately, it was just a burger with no bun, I was kind of hoping it would either be wrapped in lettuce or they would have a GF bread. But, it was good. Their french fries have so much potential, they were shoestring and cooked perfectly, but had almost no seasoning. All they need to do is throw a little seasoning on those puppies and they would be fantastic.   Service and management were really great. They gave us a free dessert (GF souffle) because we had a little incident with another patron. It had nothing to do with them, but they apologized for it and gave us the dessert, which I thought was really nice. And the fact that they remembered I was doing the GF thing was really cool.   I would definitely go here again and they had a fairly decent size gluten free menu if you need it. :)  TVs in the bar area.

This place is very clean and neatly decorated. They have gluten free pancakes available, of more than one kind! That was a nice surprise because I miss ordering pancakes for breakfast. Service was a bit slow, but the place was busy at 1030 on a weekday and I wasn't in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal. I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the area.

I only booked a manicure here (btw if you are only doing a mani, the only one available is the $40) so I came in and was booked in by very friendly staff. I was then taken back to the waiting/lounge area and offered water or tea. The lady then took me back up front to get a pass for the use of the spa (jacuzzi, steam room) for 24 hours. If you book any service, you will get a pass.   Anyway, Marisol did my manicure and I have to tell you, she is hands down the best manicurist I HAVE EVER HAD. I had it done a week ago, and I don't even have one chip and you can barely tell its growing out. Its almost like a gel mani. She is amazing and super fast. I hate when all I want to is to get my nails done and move on with my life and Im stuck in a salon for an hour or more.  She also uses this spray that dries them super fast and IT ACTUALLY WORKS.   Highly recommend her and the spa! I will be going back next time Im in town!

Total random location in a strip mall type thing. Had to park in the back, as the front is almost always full.  I have no idea how I happened upon this place, but I'm glad I did, it never disappoints. The wait staff seem like a family, I could be wrong, but I liked that about it.  The food was very good. I had an omelette on one occassion and the country fried steak on another. Always have leftovers, the portions are pretty big. The prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. You might have to wait a bit for your food, but its worth it.

I love this little theatre! I come here all the time. Clean, comfortable and nice staff. Most importantly, the popcorn is yummy!

I really like this place. I have been here a couple of times, for different things. This last time was for an aromatherapy massage ($50 for an hour! It was a special). The masseuse was on time, attentive and did a great job. You get a nice warm robe when you are done and can use the sauna, shower etc in the spa. Apparently, you also have access to the pool for the day, however, I have not ever taken advantage of this.  They have a nice morrocan oil mask for your hair available for when you use the sauna, which comes with a little eye mask. The red flower products are the best! I thoroughly enjoy coming here, it is a smaller spa, which is something I like. The staff have always been very friendly and not one bit pretentious.  I recommend getting on the email list, they always run some great specials. Also, they will add gratuity automatically when you pay, which works perfect for me, but is something you should be aware of.

Amazing. I scheduled a 60 minute facial with Irene. The room was very relaxing. The table was comfortable and warm. The products she used were great, especially the Clean Skin one, I think that's what its called, it was cooling and tingly. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back!!

I got delivery from these guys. Just ordered a cheese pizza and their tomato and cheese bread. The 18 inch pizza seemed ginormous, the crust was OK, not super thick or too doughy. The cheese was good, perfectly cooked, not burnt.   I really enjoyed their cheese/tomato bread (essentially like a garlic bread type appetizer) but did not like the dipping sauce. The delivered within about an hour (which is fine, my place can be hard to find) and I enjoyed the meal.  Would I order from them again? Absolutely. Are they the best pizza in the world? No, but for 20 bucks for all that food, it suited me just fine. :)

Humongous omelettes. Very great service. Clean and cute decor. Try the Mexicana omelette, the green chili salsa adds a nice kick!

YUMMY!!!! I used a Groupon for this and was definitely pleased. I got a mix, or "bakers choice" of 12 different cupcakes. They were delish! I have sampled many cupcakes in town and these guys are my favorite! The cake is moist and the frosting is not overwhelming, like a lot of places.

I love these guys. Joe is the best. They use new plastic basins in the pedicure tub, which is a nice bonus.

We went here for NYE dinner and I will be back very soon! I had the T bone....well seasoned, perfectly cooked, it was heaven. I also got mac and cheese as a side, yum! My starter was a warm goat cheese salad and can I just tell you how happy I was with those little goat cheese balls? So happy!  Yes, it's in a strip mall next to Panda. Such a random place for this little gem, but don't let that deter you. I can't wait to go back! Also, the service was excellent!

Holy crap this place is good!!  We randomly stopped by this place today and wow, was it a great choice! I had the appetizer pork shoulder tostada (YUM) and the shepards beanie pie (delicious). My companion had the scallops- scallops can either totally suck or be delicious...they were delicious, perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.   GO HERE NOW!!

Liz is AMAZING! I have been going to her for about 6 months for eyelash extensions and she does an amazing job. This is her place, as in she owns it, its small, but very cute. She is very flexible with scheduling and can frequently get you in on short notice. She is friendly and chatty, a joy to be around.  I know she does facials and possibly some microderm, but I have yet to try those. If you need some to do your lashes though, I would highly recommend her!!

Came here for lunch and was unimpressed. The waitress brought us soup and salad as soon as we sat down and then was gone for like 10 minutes. No drinks. I did not try any sushi, so it could be spectacular for all I know. I had the lunch portion of Teriyaki beef, which was a good portion, but the meat was really tough. I did like the sauce, though.  We also ordered gyoza, which I liked, but the dipping sauce was off. My bf ordered the Tempura lunch, which was a good portion but again, the dipping sauce was off.   Probably would not rush back here, but I am always willing to try something more than once, because you never know!

YUM!! This place is very close to my house, which could be good or bad. We came in during an early afternoon and were the only ones there. The place is nice and clean, decorated sparsely but, it looks nice.  We ordered the corn fritters for an app and they did not disappoint. I am actually thinking about going back just for those as I type this. I had the Pad Thai, it was made with the perfect amount of heat I requested. I can't recall what my friend had, but he loved it. I woul recommend this place to anyone, its nice to have some Thai food in this area. There aren't many options here in South Scottsdale.

I really like this place. We went on Sunday to check out this new place, I was a pretty regular customer of the old cinema here. It is decorated really cute, has a nice large bar and dining area in the old lobby. The food was really good too, with generous portions. We had the Nacho Libre, a burger and the Children of the Corn. P.S. Their food has clever names.  The seats were super comfortable!! Better than the ones at the new Harkins, even! You do get to pick your own seats and the staff will bring the food to you. Also, the staff were amazing, super friendly and helpful.  I will be back for sure!
