I will never be able to decide between this place and Harkins. I guess I'll have to have a secret relationship with both...   Cons: Expensive drinks, with no cup you can reuse like Harkins. Chairs don't rock :( Yes I am a child inside and like to rock during my movies, don't judge.   Pros: Cheaper movie tickets than Harkins, more comfortable seats, a cleaner feeling and last but not least... they keep it super cold! I'm from Flagstaff, yes that's a Pro!  Recommended to all

This pest control service was great to explain everything, show up on time, and offer decent pricing. While it is not the cheapest, it is one of those you get what you pay for things. You get a deal for setting up bimonthly service, and breaking that "contract" is only 49 bucks, not too bad! All the staff was friendly, from people on the phone to the person that came out to the house.

Typical Chipotle. Same layout and choices as all. Always busy, but always maintaining their composure and busting through the lines like a boss. Great food.

Came here based off of the reviews saying how quick they were able to people's items complete and was sadly disappointed. I pulled up and saw a same day service sign, and was even more excited.   When I arrived the work was polite enough to get up and pause his phone conversation, collect all my contact information (with the person on the phone hearing everything), and then tell me he couldn't have it done for three days. The reason? Because tomorrow is Saturday, and they can't run their equipment on Saturdays...... You're probably wondering the same thing I was.  After failing to get further information, and even offering to pay more, my suit and I had to leave to find a place that offers same/next day service. Luckily the owner was able to quickly jump back on his phone and into his seat.   My fault for pushing it so close, but the customer service was far from acceptable.

I drive over thirty minutes to come shooting at this range due to the quality of both the range and the staff. The have two separate sections so that it is not as loud (it is an indoor shooting range, it's going to be loud), and their tactical bay has some pretty cool items such as an item that simulates a wall. The ranges are very nice and are automated so you know exactly what distance you are shooting. It's very convent all lanes are pistol and rifle.   The main reason I drive so far to come to this range is because the range officers and masters are all polite. Other ranges, they are arrogant and make you feel as if you are a criminal. Most SGC range officers balance ensuring your safety while not giving the breathing down the neck feeling I received at other places. Of course every gun store/range will have "that guy", but for the most part SGC employees are all very friendly and helpful. Pricing is very decent at $15 and membership is $30 and includes a lot.

Pretty fun here. This is the party place of the summer thats for sure. It's a good place to escape for children. Everyone is drinking and having a good time. They throw marshmallows the whole time.... not to sure what that's about. There's a place to jump off a cliff. People are so into it they build sound systems into their coolers, so as long as you have an open taste in music you will have a great time the whole way!Lots of cops so if you plan on getting stupid wasted... here is not the place.

Went here because of the 30 min see the doc guarantee, and the fact that I don't have a pcp down here yet. Saw the doc in about five minutes, considering he was just reading a book in the corner where everyone could see him.  He seem every rushed and like he wasn't listening to a thing I was saying. He Left the room and I'm pretty sure he forgot about me. I sat in the room for 40 mins, and didn't seem him again till I left the exam room to go looking, and he was just sitting as his computer. No other patient in the place. The extra star is for the front desk and nurse, very friendly.

This place is the typical hole in the wall Mexican restaurant you will find. The staff was friendly and the chips and salsa were great. The rice and beans were really good but the enchilada sauce the use did not taste very good to me at all, but that's just my opinion. My wife was happy with her food so I assume I just need to try something else. It is a very clean place. But as the other review says, it would be wise not to come during school hours, as the high school is literally across the street.

The food and staff here are equally amazing. It's set up similar to a Subway, where you say what you want and can go down the line. There is a mixture of meat that is already prepared and meat that isn't, so sometimes it does take longer to prepare your food. The breakfast burrito is amazing, especially if you get everything on it. The staff is bilingual so that people like myself who can't speak Spanish can still enjoy their delicious food.

Rubios is my go to stop on Tuesday's for their 1.50 fish tacos! The staff is always really friendly, and food comes out fast. The food tastes great, they have an amazing salsa bar, and they actually include the lime with your taco! It may not seem like a big deal but when I get home and other places didn't include the lime, and I forget to ask, I just sit in the kitchen and cry....

Well judging for the other reviews I must have come on a bad day. I came to return the collar I bought for my dog because I did not fit like I thought it would. And I will start off with admitting I did not have the receipt, but I purchased it with my Pals card and the purchase can be looked up with that. I also made another hole to try to get the collar to fit. I knew I was taking a chance of being told I couldn't return it.   I go into the store and let the cashier know I wanted to return it (my bad I used the word return instead of exchange which is what I really wanted to do). I let her know I did not have my receipt and instead of letting me finish saying I used my Pals card, or saying she could only do a refund I got a " We can't help you without a receipt". Hmmmm. I said I meant I wanted to exchange it and she said "Well I guess that's about all we can do". I was so shocked from her attitude I forgot to mention I poked a hole to see if I could even exchange it with that hole. I'm looking at collars and another lady came up to me said " we don't take damaged merchandise" in a very rude tone, rolls her eyes, and walks away before I even get a chance to say anything. But even if she would have stuck around I was too amazed by the horrible service from her and the cashier. I just left.  I call Petco corporate and the apologize and are very friendly (where the two stars come from). They did the normal thing for a complaint and offer free things. While that's nice and all I asked if I could just get a call from store management instead. She still sends the coupons for free stuff, and says a manager from the store will be contacting me soon. Never heard from management. Oh well.

This is the gym where you will get the most bang for your buck.. When we were first taking our tour we couldn't believe it. Price was the only thing on my mind because there was so much. When you first walk in you see the cafe and spa they have. The spa does haircuts, massage, nails, etc. They cafe is a full cafe with seating and everything, and only serves healthy items. Next you see the indoor lap pool and little seating area with leather couches and a large flatscreen tv. Next is the rock climbing wall, two basketball courts, and 4 raquetball courts. Then the locker rooms that look like they belong in Scottsdale. There's another seating area in there with leather couches, a big flatscreen, and Directv. Tons of lockers, sinks, showers and a steam room. Then you see the indoor lap pool again, along with the indoor normal pool with 2 water slides. Then the sauna. Then the outdoor pool with a lap pool, regular pool, and two waterslides. Next you get taken up to where the machines are, and there are PLENTY. They are all new and in good shape as well. They have tons of classes. A ton are free, some like crossfit and bootcamp are extra. And its only about 55 a month per person! not too bad! The minus is that the place is big on kids, which most gyms are. They have a kid care for when you are working out. But during the summer they have the summer camp which takes over everythingggggggggggg. It takes the rock wall, both basket ball courts, all raquetball courts, outside pool. ETC. Which is great for the kids, but maybe they could take something different each day, instead of all at once? Good gym overall

The first thing I noticed here was the price, holy cow was it expensive. But I heard it was good so I tried it. I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich. It took a decent amount of time to come out, and the girl who rang me up went back to check and see what was taking so long. I appreciated that she felt it was taking longer than normal, and acted on it. She came back to me with my sandwich and a cookie, and explained to me that they were short people that day, which happens anywhere. Overall the food is  really good, with good service, but a little pricey.

I came here for the happy hour which actually does offer decent prices on their "rolls" and drinks, The food tasted great and the service was really good for how busy they were. The only thing I didn't like is that the rolls are smaller than any other sushi place I have gone to down here, so it kinda took away the value from happy hour.

I still think Krispy Kreme has the best donuts in this world. No matter what diet I'm on., what health kick I'm on, anything I will always fall for one of these donuts, always. The price is just way too much for deep fried dough. But some how I find myself still paying it..... I can't figure out how it happens!

I have been coming here for at least a year, and will not go anywhere else. The first time I came here I had Chris, or as I like to calm him, my beauty advisor. I have requested him every time since then, as he has always been extremely thorough and can hold a real conversation, instead of the normal generic conversations that are often forced in customer service situation. I have not had any issues with Chris or the shop in general, and will continue to consult with my beauty advisor on a monthly basis.

This place has some amazing sushi, and a large fishtank with some pretty cool fish in there! I can only comment on the Sushi because that is all I had, but it was amazing. They service was awesome too. They have happy hour Monday-Friday 3-7. But be warned happy hour is only offered to the outside patio, so you have to question "Is money or not being on fire more important to me".

This place is just as good as all the other Yelpers say! Food is good, service is good, atmosphere is good.... well I guess that means everything there is good! It's a little bit on the higher end of the pay scale, specialty dogs are about 6 bucks, but you get what you pay for! Definitely worth it.

The con: Holy pricey, more than starbucks.   The pros: EVERYTHING else. All the people there are very friendly. While it is pricey I do think you get your moneys worth. Their regular is Starbucks large and their large is 32oz :O. The plain straight coffee is something like 59 cents if your bring your own cup. They have a punch card like everywhere else so you can get things free after so many. I need to get a part time job here or I'm going to go broke with how much I spend at this place ! haha

I'm going to go ahead and rate this like the FAST FOOD restaurant that it is. The food is good as far as fast-food goes, and I have always had a great experience with the staff (even on my 3am trips). Regarding the getting sick thing, personally most fast food leaves me spending more time in the bathroom than normal, so I cannot comment on that.   I would recommend it if you are looking for fastfood, but it is fast-food.

I agree with the other poster, this place is interested in your(or your insurances) money. I have back pain from a car accident. They ordered an MRI and weirdly enough I have a "slightly" bulging disc in the same spot I have pain. But it's considered "normal" in their eyes. But at the same time still continue to order tests. Ordered a steroid shot in my back for the area that was considered "normal", but if it's normal why do I need it ? Hmmmm. Oh yeah. Because my insurance can pay out a pretty penny for it. And I really don't like when the doctor says he will come back in the room to talk to you, then sends his assistant to talk to you and sends you on your way.

I tryyyyyyy to avoid rating fast food because it's basically all the same, but this one just begged for it. The customer service is probably the worst out there, very rude people. The place smells like a gym without and ventilation, not sure if it's the employees or just the place... or a combo of both? Their food presentation is horrible, and yes I do mean horrible for a fast food place, so I'm not setting high expectations. They can't even get the ice cream IN the cup for the rootbeer float. And when they see it's hanging out of the cup dripping down the side they chose handing it to you instead of wiping the cup off. Same with the hot dogs. Is is that hard to get the condiments on the hotdog? Apparently. They extra star is because once you deal with the bad service, singe your nose hair due to the smell, and put your food back together/clean up, the food is decent.

If you have to use this business, I would review what you pay extremely thoroughly.The only reason this isn't a one star review is because the staff in the buildings are very polite.   I went in for an MRI, and even though my insurance card said I had a copay for a certain amount, they had me pay a much higher amount. It was there "estimate after insurance", I was confused since I only had a copay, but figured I may be wrong and could sort it out later.   I get the explanation of benefits from my insurance, and sure enough I only should have paid the copay, as my insurance paid every other penny owed. You call to contact them and if you select the option requesting an account review(it happens enough that there is an option for it), you go straight to a voicemail saying it will be reviewed within 3-4 weeks. This was back in August... I still have yet to get the $50ish dollars I am owed... or speak to a human being for that matter.   I have called multiple times, and if you just call the front desk to ask about it they tell you that you have to leave a voicemail. Seems pretty fishy to me...

I went here with a Groupon which doesn't really matter, but some places treat you different when you go with coupons. I thought that would be the case at first when I pulled up and they asked which wash I wanted, then asked if I had a Groupon. It concerned me because the people washing the car didn't need to know, just the cashier. But I was hoping they were just curious and didn't plan on using that against me. They didn't. They did an awesome job on my car. I have spent hours cleaning it before, and they did a better job in thirty minutes.   In the lobby waiting area they have the glass so you can see your car going through, and then it pulls out and you can see everyone working hard on it.   I would recommend this place to anyone. I will be going back with my other car and getting their headlight restoration, and will update on that service!

I have continued to go here since my first review, and this is the only car wash I go to.   I had one night where someone had the bright idea of leaving a jack in the box bag full of tacos on my seat, needless to say I got a lovely grease stain out of that. I took it to blue wave for a car wash and they took care of the seat at a good price.   Next day the stain popped up again so I stopped by. They redid it and even ran it through the car wash again for free. Really good service !

(Beware, lengthy review due to outstanding service. Summary in the last paragraph)  As I was driving my brand new car down the 202, the lovely car in front of me decided that my windshield looked it needed a "spark" to it, and that is how I got a quarter sized crack in my windshield. You see all these companies offering money back, and have to wonder how they are able to do this. After researching a little, I found out a lot of these companies that promise you ___ back no matter what select cheap sealants, windshields, etc. I also found an article saying how the windshield was extremely important incase of a vehicle rollover, and that article basically said to avoid companies giving you money to replace your windshield.   Well, being the poor college student I am I was sure I could find a company that used high quality products and could still give me some cash. I found SafePro through Angie's List, they had great reviews on there and I noticed it said "up to" on their cash back amount. With the good reviews I called and asked all the questions an article I found said would tell you if this was a good glass company or not. After answering all those questions right (poor guy probably felt like he was being interviewed or secret shopped), he explained all the products their company used, and even how the cash back system worked (splitting the profit). While I did not get the $200 some companies offered, I got $50 and peace of mind.   Raphael was the reps name, he was very helpful, answered all my questions, and even helped me complete my insurance crap. They showed up on time and replaced the windshield, there was no mess, nothing missing, and everything back in it's place down to the oil change sticker.   I kid you not, a little over a month later I was headed to Flagstaff and got ANOTHER crack in my windshield. Two cracks in a little over one month, and I've never had a cracked windshield before. Really weird, and I'm sure my insurance company was saying the same thing lol.   After my choice words and time to calm down I called SafePro again, and got Raphael again. He even remembered me, that's how recent this was :( anyways same great service and helping me with insurance. I ask him if I can pay extra for a reinforced windshield, if there even was such a thing. He told me about a product that I remember being offered when I bought the car for $100, and he didn't even charge me half of that!   Lengthy review, but summary is Raphael and SafePro really go above and beyond to get you the best deal, and will bend over backwards to work with your schedule. I would recommend them to anyone needing their windshield replaced... maybe change the hold "music" though lol

I went here with a groupon, the facilities were nice as was the staff. The massage provided was amazing. They have a membership program you can sign up for that makes massages a little more affordable. But they have some weird hours. It works out good if you work from 8-5, but if you have weird hours you may not be able to see them. Overall I will go back. Just have to make appointments far in advance.

This place is awesome! It is a good area away from all the college people who go out with the intention of getting beyond wasted. They had a live band the night I was there, a DJ before and after the live band, two dance floor and two bars. Honestly, it was almost a culture shock having room to move in a bar. I will be back for sure!

I have come back many times since my last review, and the only thing I have to add is shootouts to the staff. Brian, the security guard at the front is courteous, yet stern-- something no other bar I have been to has been able to figure out.   Heather, a bartender, is the same way. She is extremely courteous, and remembers regulars. However, if you are looking for someone to cat call or anything of the sort, she is also capable of ripping you a new one. I highly suggest asking for her as your bartender-- if you know how know how to be a grown up.   My only problem is I have tried to coordinate team builders for my volunteers multiple times, and getting in touch with management is the equivalent of giving a pterodactyl a root canal... It's just not going to happen.   Awesome work Brian and Heather, keep it up!

When you first walk in the prices set you back a little, seeing as one slice and a drink run about five bucks. But take a look at the pictures on here before you leave due to pricing, because their serious slices are seriously huge. It did take a little to come out, but it was definitely worth it when it got there.  It was the best pizza I've had in Phoenix, by far.

If you get bottle service, be sure to ask for Kaddie. She has an awesome personality and can hold a conversation--pretty rare to find that in Old Town! Kaddie, the VIP Host Jon, and Princeton from security are what keep me coming back!   The reason for my review only being four stars is the pricing of drinks (high even for it being Scottsdale) and they have a promo crew every Friday night who are typically rude and charge a cover for no-name artists. Granted they have som big names like Ace Hood, which I happily paid a $20 dollar cover for--but even charging $5 to see someone like Tupac's uncle's dad's brother's cousin through marriage is too much.  Oh, and it wouldn't kill the promo crew that collects the money at the door to smile... I promise!

The service Matt and his crew provided is beyond amazing! Matt was always great about texting appointment reminders so I could make sure my dogs were inside (my choice, his crew loves dogs), and was very polite the few times I forgot to make a payment. He understands life happens, he does an amazing job, and he is one of the few companies in the world the puts customer service first.   Need I say more? If you are looking for pet waste removal or any other services in that category, I highly reccomend going with Matt's company.

This coffee blows starbucks out of the water, on everything I have tried. On iced drinks they only charge you for a medium, but you get a large. Finally someone understands you shouldn't charge the same when ice takes up a good amount of the room! They used to have awesome happy hour deals, but no longer offer it :( Hopefully the owner brings it back soon, I would be there a lot more often.

Never been to a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, never had a veggie burger, about as new as I could be to the scene. The person taking the orders was very nice, patient, and friendly. I had a cider that was definitely not the best, but I ordered the big wac for my meal and it was ORGASMIC. If it was closer, I would be here every day!  While I was there, there was consistently plenty of seating. The staff were all very attentive as well. Great first experience at a restaurant like this!

This place is the poster child for how not to run a medical office. I found a doctor that had great reviews and called to make an appointment with him. After I waited on hold ten minutes someone answered and I told them I wanted to make an appointment for that doctor. They took all my information and then informed me he no longer worked there but they were scheduling me with "____" (don't remember the name).  Hmmmmmmm okay, thanks for telling me he didn't work there after you took all my information. Oh also, thanks for asking if I wanted to be scheduled with a different doctor instead of assuming. I just said okay and hung up to do my research. Luckily the doctor she scheduled me with had just as good of ratings, so I went to see him.   The doctor was great and full of knowledge. However anytime you needed to call there was a minimum wait time of 10 min, and I had multiple incidents were the front desk staff did not communicate information to the MA or doctor like they said they would. When I actually saw the doctor and mentioned that I had not heard back you could tell by his face that he did not get the message, and was very frustrated over it. Since my issues could cause a need for him to get a message right away he had to give me his cell phone number and his assistants number. How sad is that, he can't even trust the front desk to forward a message.   After a year of seeing him I get a call that he no longer works there and they needed to schedule me with his replacement (looks like they're running the good doctors out to me). I had no choice but to say yes and go see his replacement. His replacement was horrible and after a year of being a patient treated me like I was a drug addict and was very rude.   I complained to the "patient care manager", who said she would file it as a formal complaint and gave what seemed like the most unsympathetic apology on the planet. I asked for my medical records so I could go to a different doctor and have all my records instead of having to go to the new doctor, have them request the records, and come back after they got the records. There was a $25 dollar fee for me to obtain my records and when I asked the patient care manager to waive that fee. I explained I wanted to have the copies available for the new doctor, I was not at fault for my old doctor leaving, and I tried to stay at the core institute but there was an already explained issue with the doctor. Again, no sympathy, just told me to have my new doctor request my records and it will be free. Well, thanks for entirely ignoring my explanation and telling me something I already knew.   After my complaint the doctor has been much nicer, so I assume even though she was extremely unsympathetic that she did file it as a formal complaint which was addressed. Now if only they could get phone wait times below ten minutes and train the front desk on how to pass on important messages they could retain doctors and patients.

Just like most reviews on here say, these wings are delicious! I have tried about 8 of the flavors, all were great. They Cajun Hot were the best ones out there. The reason a star in lost is because of the customer service there. The cashiers are all nice and friendly. They people in back are always giving the worst looks to the customers. Oh well. It tastes good. A little bit higher on the price scale, but the wind size makes up for it.

Called this place based off of yelp reviews, and after my whole incident with this place went through the reviews again, and something is definitely fishy about this business' yelp page.   So I call the number listed, no answer, so I leave a message saying everything I was looking for. Someone called back saying they were with Arizona Pest Squad and missed a call from my number. I asked if he listed to my message, he said no. So I had to explain myself all over again. At the end he said he would be at my house around 430. I thought to myself, same day service?! How awesome. 430 comes, 530 comes, 630 comes and they call saying that they got caught on a job with bees. Understandable, but a call before you were gonna be late would have been awesome so I didn't sit around waiting for you. Person said he could come out right then or about the same time the next day. I said right then worked, he then asked if the next day would be ok.... sooooo why did you give me a choice if you weren't going to go with the one I picked? Anyways he offered 50% off to do it the next day around 430, and I'll never say no to cheap stuff.   Same thing next day, except this time he called about 530. I didn't even answer because I couldn't believe I fell for it a second time. He left a message saying he didn't want to come out because it was raining, but would if I wanted him to. I didn't call back. I go out in the living room and see something in my door frame, a note saying sorry we missed you, it's raining, will call to make another appt. Never knocked or rang the doorbell. I have two large dogs, who have something against doorbells and anyone who touches the door, so I know for a fact there was no effort to get my attention while at the house.   So I write the managers an e-mail explaining my whole story. Apparently the guy I had been talking to was a owner. He kept referring the the "yelp review" I wrote, when I had just e-mailed him and never said a word about it on yelp, yet. He offered to service my property for free. I couldn't say no to free stuff, so we set it up a fourth time.... when am I gonna learn, right?   I waited until the time we discussed, and at the exact minute he was late, I left to go workout. I was done with this company. He doesn't call me till an hour later saying he's at my house, and to call back and reschedule... AGAIN. No thanks, you couldn't pay me to waste anymore of my time waiting for a company that couldn't show up to save their lives. Run fellow yelpers, run.   It is one thing to be late and let someone know, it is another to be late four times, and not call till at least an hour later every time. I do appreciate him offering to take half off, and to fully cover the bill the next time it happened. But you can't keep screwing up and being late.

The owner called me and offered a sincere apology. While it does not fix that fact that I got the run around, it does show that the owner cares about his business. The apology was greatly appreciated.

This place is an amazing little coffee shop. The coffee was delicious and I had a spinach artichoke panini that was amazing! The service was friendly and quick, and the atmosphere was very laid back!  Thankfully, I live around the corner and will be returning soon!

I came here just looking around and with how great everything was wound up leaving with one! I worked with Chase and his product knowledge was amazing. He talked to me for a good hour on all my options, most places would be annoyed by that point. His pricing was amazing, he was only $10 dollars above what the stereo was going for on amazon (100 dollars less than retail price on pioneer.com) and his install price was great. Only took about an hour and a half and it turned up perfect ! Would recommend to anyone in the market for a car stereo. He's not pushy either. Let's you decide what you want.

This in not your typical gun store. If you are looking for guys that glare at you as you walk in, will try to force their opinion of a gun down your throat, and will charge way more than they should, you will have to go somewhere else because this place is the exact opposite.   Every time I have gone in here I have been greeted by a smiling person. I have never had to listen to someone's opinion about how horrible the gun I want is, and tell me I should by a higher priced one.   All their prices are very competitive in my opinion, the best I have seen down here. Granted I don't go to places like Cabelas or other large firearm stores because I like dealing locally, but just a quick web search I haven't seem anything cheaper. I know their ammo prices are almost impossible to beat.   They also have a large selection of sights and scopes which they put on for you at no extra charge. They have paper targets, metal targets, cleaning kits, reloading and hunting equipment, etc. For a smaller store they have tons of stuff and if they don't have what you're looking for, they will order it.   I have bought guns from there, and they will answer any questions you have. They will also show you how to take it apart, clean it, etc if you are interested.   Very good local shop with great people.

Came here with a Groupon and will be returning a lot more often. The staff is all friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and the food is amazing!

Pros:  The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and improved the experience. The food and drinks were also very good. The menus are made of license plates and there are other items that give the "speak easy" type feeling.   Cons:  Biggest con is the price point. While I expected it to be higher than regular, I wasn't expecting $120 bill for two people. The Moscow mule alone is $14 dollars I found it difficult to find. While I expected to have to do some searching since its in a resort, I didn't expect it to be hiding behind the resort.    TLDR: Really good, be prepared to pay a lot. Located behind the lobby.

Since I found this place, I have come here at least twice a month. They are always extremely friendly, always get a great cut, and love the fact that they have TVs.   The only thing I would suggest is a sign in list, even if it's self sign in.

They have nice facilities, but large prices. The front desk staff all think they have the worlds best gun training, and are far superior to anyone that walks in that store. Everyone better kiss their feet because no one could possibly have more training than the 8 hour class they went through, if that. As for the range masters I had when I was there, one was young, cocky, and texted the whole time.... hmmmmm should "range masters" really be texting? Especially the entire time? The other range master wasn't cocky, was informative, and friendly. Making that one out of three employees I dealt with that were actually worth anything.

**update: After the gm did not call back, and would not speak to me at the bar, I went to great lengths to find the owner. I was given his contact information by the marketing director, Tyler(really nice guy), I contacted the owner. The second I asked if we could discuss the reasoning I was not allowed in the bar, he said he had to go so he could use his GPS and would call me back in ten minutes. Understandable, we've all been there. Still haven't heard back... More than 24 hours later. Oh well, didn't go there that much anymore anyways. Just really wanted to know why I wasn't allowed there. Thankfully whiskey row opens up soon.   Tonight I go with a friend before it is even "club" hours. Check in with security at the front, say hi to all the staff I know, and literally bro hug one of the best security guards they have. We order beers and food, and then another security guard comes up and tells us we have to leave because I have be "86ed". The security guard was surprised, the one that bro hugged me was surprised, and I was flabbergasted and embarrassed.   This security guard was nice enough to let me finish my beer, but even when I told him I had food coming he said to come back in 30 min while the GM "reviewed it". He was obviously forced to say this, as he is another one of their awesome security guards.   I would love to have my money back that I paid for the food that I was not allowed to receive, but more than that, I would love for the GM to contact me as originally requested. I don't get blackout drunk, and know that I did not do anything to get "86ed".    If management is reading this, please feel free to comment or private message me. Thank you.

Always get great service at any Dutch bros I go to, definitely awesome service at this one... and the other location in Gilbert. They actually build rapport and have real conversations with you, not forced conversation like some of the other locations.   Carmalizer Freeze is the best drink... by far.

I don't even know where to begin telling you how amazing this place is! To start, when I walked I was very confused.. and the reason is sad. I was confused because the awesome lady at the cash registered asked me how my day was going, and was genuine. Wasn't the typical "Welcome" "Hi how are you" etc. I literally had to ask her to repeat herself because I was sure I missed something lol Nope, just great customer service. I also went there again a couple nights later and had to be "that person" on the phone. (don't judge, I had been playing phone tag with the client all day =]). She was understanding and at a time I would have rolled my eyes at myself, she did not.   The pizza is amazing, by far the best I have had in the valley. Huge slices, and the pricing is extremely affordable. Having a fundraising event next week and am hoping to use this company.... I'll keep you guys updated :)

Since there were so many complaints about slow delivery, I decided to be a reasonable person and order... delivery. I ordered online, had my pizza in about 40 minutes, which since they make & cook it when you order it, that is totally reasonable to me.   However, prettttttttty sure they gave me a size smaller than what I ordered, but not 100% positive. I was too hungry to bust out the ruler...

I don't even know where to begin with this review. NEVER, EVER, use this place for an event. I am flabbergasted at the service I received yesterday, as I have always received such great service prior. I gave eight hours of notice, yet the delivery was still FIFTY MINUTES LATE and the driver called me about eight times, totaling TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES GIVING THEIR DRIVER DIRECTIONS.   After it was already twenty minutes late, the driver called me 3 times for directions, and then told me he was in a completely different city, I called the store and spoke to a manager. I explained I was not trying to be rude, but I was attempting to run an event, and could not continue to provide directions when they had my exact address. The manager was apologetic, but said her computer showed the address as being in Gilbert... which is weird, as when I ordered it,  a "long distance" fee was added on for it being in Apache Junction.  The manager said she would call the driver, and give me a call back...... never heard back from her. Don't worry though, I got about 7 more calls from the driver.   Once the driver finally arrived to the event, which he knew was a charity event, he told me he could not take cards. I had asked prior and was told that wouldn't be a problem. After literally having to go round up cash from multiple people I paid him so I could finally attend my event... after missing the main presentation.   I called the store again and asked to speak to a manager, I was told she just left. I said any manager would be fine, he informed me there were no managers. After I told him everything that had happened, he said a manager would call me back once he was out of the restroom... guess what? Never heard back from that manager either.   It is still two stars because I don't have it in my heart to give them one star when I have had so many good experiences. However, it is extremely disappointing that I informed them the importance of the event, gave them plenty of notice, and this still happened.

Wow, talk about a fast resolution. Not only did the owner, Jason, reach out to me immediately-- he even sat down with me to discuss what happened. He wanted to make sure he had all the facts so that he make this a learning experience for his team, and it really came down to the computer defaulting to my home address. Jason was personable, apologetic, and personally, seeing a business go to the length of sitting down with a customer to ensure the incident doesn't repeat itself is remarkable.   Jason also told me it was even more upsetting that this happened to a non-profit, and told me some heartwarming stories of families his company has helped. Jason definitely earned my business back!   P.S. Tessa (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong), you rock.

Yikes, for being attached to such a large name they really aren't too hot. Not something most people would complain about, but they over pour drinks to the level of filling a red solo cup with alcohol. Would have loved that in high school, now that I'm a grown adult... That's just reckless.   The security thought they were cops, and were more worried about me than the girl who was white girl wasted on the bench. The worst part? The cab driver is the one that pointed that out to me. Oh well, first time there, last time there. They'll likely be closed soon like the rest.

I found Dony, the owner, in downtown Scottsdale when I was looking for a ride home and other companies rates were "surging". Dony was not one of those annoying guys on the street begging for your business, he was just sitting in his car with his light on saying he was available.   Being a Denali I expected pricing to be crazy, but it was less than I paid to get there. I was amazed. I got his card and have used his service multiple times since. Same great quality.  He said people remember him by "Dony the Denali" and he operates off word of mouth. I figured I needed to tell the Yelp community about him!
