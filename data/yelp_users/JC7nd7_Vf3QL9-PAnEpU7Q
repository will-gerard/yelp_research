Working 3rd shift and this is the closest place that is open. Overnight staff is quick and nice. They don't mind that I order to go, and usually offer me a soda or other beverage while I wait. Definite staple in my 3rd shift diet.

Having gotten delivery from here a few times when I worked downtown I found that they had a diverse menu and prices where reasonable for the amount of food you got. The Gyro's where good but the Stuffed Avocado was EPIC. It is my go to item here.

I have been going to this place for the last 7 years or more. It is what you expect for cheap Chinese food. It is even referred to by my wife a "The Cheap Chinese Place". The Sweet and Sour Pork is a staple. The egg rolls are awesome and the Ice Tea is cold.. most of the time. The "To Go" Order is an amazing amount of food for the price. I highly recommend this place for a try. Don't go in expecting the best but it's better than most.

Stopped for dinner. Lettuce Wraps are amazing.. Crab Ragoons could use some more cream cheese.. overall not a bad meal.

My wife and I went for dinner last night. We got there and where told it would be about 11minuites to be seated. It took 4. Our Waiter (Cameron) was there at the table very quickly. He got our drink order and my Wife ask if they had Prime Rib. Cameron said it was running short. He took our order and was back quickly. They where out of Medium Rare Primerib. He brought us menus again and we started over. In a few minutes he was back with a piece of the oven roasted Fillet. We sampled it and decided to go with that. Cameron was on top of the Ice Tea and service was amazing. The manager stopped by to check on things and I expressed how great Cameron was doing. The manager comped our desert and gave me his card. He said call ahead and they would save some Prime Rib in the future for us. This is the best experience I have ever had at any chain restaurant.

This is what I would call a Phoenix Institution. Having eaten here many times over the span of 20+ years the food has never changed. Great food at great prices. Note they do close at 7pm most nights so get there early for dinner. Also get some fresh Tortilla's to go you will not regret it.

I have eaten here for the last 10 years. Once again I am working in the downtown area and there are quite a few Mexican restaurants near me but I will always drive down to South Phoenix to grab food from here. In 10 years the food has not changed. It is the same great Carne Asada Taco's and Burrito's I have enjoyed over and over.  While living in Texas I would come back to Phoenix to visit and this was always on the list of places I had to go. Breakfast Lunch or Dinner this restaurant can serve up some of the best food in town.

Far from my normal cuisine we went for lunch. Service was ok, Not amazing. Food was good. Flavors where interesting and overall it was a good meal. It won't be a regular stop on my places to eat but once in a while it will make for a nice change of pace.

If I could eat here every day I would. The staff is great, The food is good, The soda fountain has Mt. Dew. This is what a burger joint should be.

My mother had two procedures done there this morning. Ultrasound and MRI. Staff was really nice but the Issue is that when we get there they spring a $640 co-pay on her. They did not tell her ahead of time so someone who is already under immense stress. This caused her to panic about the procedure. I think that this should be on the check list of the pre-registration.

Another spot that I like 24/7. The staff is great. The food is standard Denny's food. This place has been here for 30 years and I have gone there for that long. Never very busy and always good service.

After seeing this on twitter we stopped in. A day early for their social media specials but still worth the visit. Wife's dinner had some issues. Manager on duty came out and talked to us, Comped her meal and our Ice Teas. My dinner was awesome. Can't wait to go back.

Went there on a whim last night. Mondays are all you can eat Tacos. Started out with the Spinach Con Queso dip and the All You Can Eat Tacos. The first plate was 2 Machaca Tacos with Rice and Beans. Each refill was 2 more Tacos. As a Taco Lover I have to say these where some damn fine tacos. I will be going back. Likely many times.

When I am in this part of town and want amazing food, Awesome service and friendly faces CK's is where I want to go. Sad to say that Tommy Pierucki is no longer there and has moved on to bigger and better things but he will always be credited with spreading the word to me and others about this amazing restaurant.

Customer Service... what's that? This place has no clue. Rude, and outright mean. They had nothing nice to say about anything or anyone in the store. I would rather drive miles out of my way than ever set foot in this place again. If you must use UPS to ship something there are many other locations that will treat you like a customer, not an annoyance.   If it matters I was shipping a RMA Computer Hard Drive. The guy at the counter was rather upset that I had the nerve to ask for some tape to seal the box and attach the pre-paid label. His justification was that his store saw no profit from people using pre-paid labels that are bought online and printed out. The tape costs $3.00 a roll. That is a 200ft roll.. So the 8" that I needed set him back about $.13. His attitude forever lost him a customer. I ship things such as this 4-9 times a year. Never will another item be sent from this location.

I was introduced to this store by some friends who gave it awesome reviews. For the 2009 Fetish Ball the wife needed some idea's. We headed over to Fetish Falls on the Friday before. The store was very busy that afternoon. I was amazed at the awesome Customer service. Everyone was there to help the customers.   As the wife tried on different things I was ask multiple times by different employees if I needed assistance. Their attention to the customer is amazing. When it comes to the Customer service I wish this was the norm and not the exception.  The selection is Amazing. The layout is great. I would send anyone I talk to down to visit Fetish Falls.  The Fashion show at the Fetish Ball was a great show. The space provided for the fashion show was a bit small but the MC and the models handled it with professionalism.   The booth Fetish Falls had was easy to find. It was actually the first one I saw when I walked in the door. The girls all said Hi and gave us hugs. They had a bit less stock than what I saw in the store yet the selection was amazing. I had forgot to grab something at the store the day before and they had it there.    Visit the store.. the website.. or give them a call. They will surpass your expectations in every way.

I was sent a $20 gift card for PF Chang's from Klout. I decided to take my wife there today for lunch. Knowing that it would be busy I predicted a wait. They quoted 25-30 min's however it was only about 10. That was great. Over all the food was decent, However the 1 star is simply for the poor service. I could have gotten the same quality food from many places and gotten service that was far better. The waitress had to be flagged down every time we needed more tea, She seemed to be trying to rush us through the meal. At one point she even took the plate I was eating my appetizer off of. When I ask for a side of salad dressing it took forever to get this. When the time came for the bill it was dropped on the table, But no fortune cookies where there or even offered. Simply put the service was beyond bad. I don't think I will ever go back.

If it was possible to give negative ratings this would be the place to get them. Food is below average, service sucks. I have been twice.. I thought maybe the first go round was a fluke, but it's the normal thing here. Currently disputing charges on my debit card from 4 days ago, because charging me for shitty food is ok, but charging me twice is just not right. The only thing this bar has to offer is a clean restroom, and the beer was very cold. Every other aspect of this place is just another reason that it should be leveled and something worth wild be put in it's place. McFaddens... should be called McFuckedup.

I needed a haircut and a shave. It is 5:50 on a Wed. Those lame chain barber wannabe's won't do it right. I found Buzz Boyz on google and made the drive. First thing I see is that this place is serious about what they do. Old School barber chairs, Wood all around, and TV's everywhere I look. Jonathan the Owner and Barber offers you a cold drink when you walk in (Amazing). The service is top notch. I got a hair cut.. a hot lather shave.. and walked out with my wallet not feeling like it was drained. This is my new barber.

I have heard more about this from Jon H. than I can tell you. He did not understate how great these hot dogs are. I almost wouldn't categorize them as hot dogs because they are better than any others I have ever had. Short Leash Dogs is not to be missed.

5 stars.. because Yelp won't let me give it 6 stars.  Food is great, filling and well prepared. Owner is great to talk to and will answer your questions.   After eating at MANY taco places around the city this is the one I will continue to go to time and time again.

Do you like Filipino food? Wait.. you don't know? You better ask Joe. He will tempt you taste buds with some amazing food. The lumpia was amazing (Almost as good as my aunt's). As of late I have been far to busy to get back to see the Hey Joe truck but as soon as I do have time I am there.

We went with the family.. That means there where 5 adults and 1 10 year old on a sugar induced high. It was interesting. Ordering took a bit since my sister has a Gluten allergy but the waitress went above and beyond. I ordered the pork chops. When the food came I got a steak? They figured out the error and went about fixing it. There was a mix up in the beverages and my diabetic father got a glass of sweet tea when he ordered Ice tea. It was more or less one disaster after another. Through it all the waitress, the manager and even the rest of the staff went above and beyond. It will forever be a memorable experience of a night full of fail but in the end everything was fixed and we left happy. The staff is human and we all make mistakes, It's how you deal with those mistakes that makes the impression.

Dr. Hunt and Hunt Family Chiropractic provides excellent service to the patients. Dr. Hunt has a caring demenor and genuinely cares about the health and wellbeing of all his patients. After knowing Dr Hunt for numerous years I was excited to see his practice open up. I have been going for a few months now and seeing him three times a week. There is a definite improvement to be seen. My back hurts less and I feel better.

This is what I like to call a sleeper restaurant. It's next to a gas station, Has minimal parking but the food and the service can't be beat. I have been a few times and always enjoy going back. The owner is fun to talk to and he will tell you some amazing stories. Stop in and you'll see what I mean.

Referred from a Facebook friend to the shop. Followed the Facebook page and found out they have great prices on Oil Changes. Just bought a used truck and knew it needed an oil change. They had a Mon, Wed, Thur special. Before 10am get $5.00 off the $19.95 oil change. That's cheaper than doing it myself. Donuts and Coffee in the lobby. Awesome staff. Yes I will be going back and you should go to.
