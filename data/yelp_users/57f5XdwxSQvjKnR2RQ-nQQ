Food is subpar. As is the service. Go farther west.

We ate here last night before a show at Crescent Ballroom. We arrived a bit before 7pm and were a party of 6. We weren't the largest party there and definitely got there before a couple of the larger parties.   We didn't get our food until a quarter after 8 after watching the larger parties that were seated after us receive thiers.  I asked our server to bring us some to go boxes when she brought the food out, as well as the check, as we didn't want to miss the show we planned to watch and we didn't receive it for another 15 minutes.  I'm tempted to say that our server didn't place our order immediately or was too occupied with the trainee that was following her around to notice that we were in a hurry, even after I asked for the check.   The food wasn't bad, but will likely never eat here again and just spend time at the Rum Bar.

I've stayed here several times in the years since it's opened.  Most recently my husband and I decided on an impromptu stay after having breakfast at the Saddle Ranch that's a walk away at Westgate.  They currently are running a promotion for $89 a night plus taxes.  I think the whole stay was about $101.  Everything is always clean.  The staff is awesome, and the rooms have always been up to par.  When we stayed in June last year, we were upgraded to a suite for free.  We're always satisfied when staying here, and always miss it when we go home.  The pooool is amazing as well!

Love their Happy Hour.   The sake is kind of hot for my taste though.

Place is delish.   Sweet daily specials and right down the street! Love this place to watch Cardinals games.

This review isn't for the car wash, which was included in the oil change service.  The wash was decent.   I went here because I had a coupon for a $29.95 oil change that "included" the $11.95 car wash.  Spoke to a tech, who wasn't even supposed to be working that day.  He was just "helping them out."  Of course he tried to up sell everything.  Being that it had been a while since I actually had service, I got the air filter that was suggested and had my fluids filled.  I opted to not get the other filter that they offered, or anything else. At that, I left spending $50.    NOT END OF STORY.   A day later my check engine light comes on.  Of course, I think this is weird, being that to this point I've never had issues with my car.  It was too much of a coincidence for me.  Went to a local auto parts store, who ran a diagnostic check on my car, and had errors coming up in my EVAP system.  Take it to a mechanic, and one of the two hoses that triggers this error is completely unattached and the other is loose.  Whether or not this was done intentionally or accidentally, this should NEVER have happened.  Maybe I should have known better than to take my car to a car wash place to get my oil changed, but I will NEVER come back here again.  And have warned others to follow suit.

I had been going to another nail salon since I was in my teens, and opted to try something new to compensate for the long drive it was to the other salon.    Stopped in here and was immediately greeted, asked what I wanted and seated to get a pedicure.  What I'm almost sure of, is that the owner or manager makes it a point to get you seated in a chair so that you're not waiting at the front of the salon.  Definitely smart, as I've left salons in the past that have kept me waiting because of their lack of urgency.  The pedicure was good and thorough.  I got the cheapest one, which included a massage, hot towels, and hot stones.    I also got a gel manicure.  This is all subjective and depends on who you get to do your nails.  I've had three different people give me a gel manicure here, and one is definitely the far superior of the three.  He's an older gentleman, and the past two times that he's done my manicure, it lasts three weeks.  I'm pretty sure that if my nails grew slower, I could push a month or more.  He is thorough and seemingly a perfectionist, which is awesome if that's what you do for a living.   Overall the salon is clean and the service is always friendly.  Definitely a regular customer now.

Found this little place after I purchased a Groupon for services from Riley Rico.  The salon is adorable though a little hidden and adjacent to the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park.  Riley herself is a great stylist.  I got partial highlights that were ombre'd on long hair.   I explained to her that I had a previously bad experience at another salon where I asked for slightly lighter highlights than my dark brown hair and I left with bleach blonde streaks.  She heard me out, fixed the other damage and left me with exactly what I wanted.  Definitely recommended.

Reserved a room here for Strong Beer Fest. Had arranged via email that there was a possibility to check in early as we purchased $75 VIP tickets for the beer fest which would allow us to enter at 11a.  Arrived at 11:30a to the hotel, only to be told that our  room was cancelled because of a computer glitch that caused the hotel to be double booked.  The VIP incentive to our beer fest admission was canceled out by the time we spent trying to find a hotel that was reasonable, that would take us on Valentine's Day that wasn't $400 a night.

I scheduled service to get my glass fixed on my iPhone 6 after dropping it over the weekend and watching it break along with my heart.   Isaiah was waiting for me at the my address after I text him that I'd be a couple of minutes late. He was very pleasant and assessed what he needed to fix. Told me he'd be 20 minutes and that he'd ring the doorbell when he was done.   The service was actually less time and completely back to its normal fully functioning self. It was great and I'd recommend them to anyone that needs their phones or electronics repaired.
