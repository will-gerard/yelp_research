We stopped in for a bite - my dining partner hadn't been before. Samplers the falafel with hummus. Great hummus!! I had chicken souvlaki pita, he had gyro pita. Both with Greek salads. Shared an order of Greek fries. They also had a special of $5 sangria. Food was fresh and delicious. The fry toppings were great, but I wasn't nuts about the fries themselves. Our server was Madison, she was awesome!

Met a friend here for happy hour after work on a Thursday.  We sat at the bar and ordered nearly everything off the happy hour menu: Pork sliders, pork tacos, Mexican street tacos and Nachos. Rum Punch for me and G&T for him.  Later added a Cornoa and another G&T. Even later, added a coffee w/Baileys and the apple something rather dessert.   I'd go back five times a day every single day for the pork sliders - holy cow yum!  Food was fresh & colorful which is always a bonus on top of just being delicious.   Service was super fun & friendly. Didn't venture out of the bar, but the atmosphere was great.    Will hit Padre's again soon, for sure.

Hit or miss. Went in for drinks one Friday night, found 2 spots open at the bar, had great service, proper Guinness, and then enjoyed some fried pickles. The live music was great and the vibe was fun and vibrant    Went in two weeks later with intent of eating dinner, found two seats at the bar, were ignored for nearly 7 minutes (the 7 minutes before happy hour ended) while the server seemed to pretend to count her drawer, then  had to ask if we could get an order in before happy hour ended. With a sigh, she said yes, we ordered two pints of Guinness, one Jameson and the fried pickles. 10 minutes later, we had nothing in front of us. I appreciate when a bar takes the proper time with guinness, but this was ridiculous.   Usually the last few minutes before happy hour ends, the bartenders do a great job of making the rounds to make sure everyone is taken care of. Not the case at The Dubliner this night. No staff to be found anywhere. Although I could see our two pints of Guinness sitting there on the other side of the bar. Finished. Ready.  Wanting to be delivered. And when I asked the only staff in sight, she said oh yeah they're going to grab them now, I saw someone grab them, move them about two inches to the right and set them back down. Then everyone vanished again for about 4-5 more minutes.   It wasn't just is, it was everyone at the bar who was sharing the feeling of being ignored.   Finally, someone grabbed the pints and delivered then with the Jameson and dropped the fried pickles off soon after. Just in time, too, as we were just about to walk.   Wish we had. The pickles were NOTHING like our previous visit, they were barely cooked and swimming in a pool of oil. Inedible. We mentioned it to the bartender, who didn't offer any apologies, all she said was that you never know what you're gonna get, it depends on who is working the fryer that night. Wow.   With that, we gulped our drinks, paid the tab, and left. They clearly didn't want our business that night.   Usually when I have a 50/50 experience somewhere, I'll go back for a tie breaker, but it may be a while before we make it back around to The Dubliner for the deciding vote.

Love the ginger salad dressing. Food is always nice and hot. Service is very friendly. I love that they have a drive thru for those post yard work dinners (you know, when you're all dirty and sweaty and don't want to offend anyone). Definitely a great alternative to the typical burger fast food drive thru. Good prices, too!

My home had some very creative DIY type windows from previous owners that I needed replaced. Robert provided a fair and accurate quote, came out to verify measurements and final quote. I went with Simonton Windows, which only have a one week lead time.   In total I had six windows replaced by Robert & crew in around six hours. The install was quick, clean, and efficient. I'm so pleased with my new windows and the quality installation from Arizona's Best Windows. I would definitely recommend them.

A couple of weeks ago, my a/c stopped cooling. I called 4 places to have a tech come take a look at it. Aristotle Air was the first to respond. Long story short, I received excellent customer service from them through the following week. I needed an expensive part replaced due to a leak, but due to age of my unit, I decided to just replace the entire unit instead of just the part.   They gave me three options (replacement part, and 2 options for new units).  I called around to ensure I was getting a fair price, to which I was told I was getting "a very fair price".  I called Aristotle Air to give the thumbs up and one and a half days later, the new unit was installed.   Over the week leading up to discovering the leak, they came to my house four times to add coolant at no extra charge. Even on weekends and at 9:00 at night! Each tech was polite and professional.   No one enjoys having to replace their a/c unit, but dealing with Aristotle I felt I was receiving excellent, honest, and prompt customer service at all times. I have been and will be recommending them!

Dinner for two, dining in: Fresh Rolls with shrimp for appetizer (adding shrimp $3, not so sure was worth it for 4 smallish pieces, but the rolls were fresh and tasty), pork satay (yum!), massaman curry. All very good.  The atmosphere was a bit awkward at best, but not enough to stop me from going back.  Excited to have a solid Thai food option nearby!

Deanne is fantastic! I trust my hair with her and have for the last few years. When I made the dramatic change from long to short, she gave me a perfect cut, taking time to tweak it when I decided I wanted to go a bit more short than originally planned. Now that I'm growing it out again, she is keeping me well styled through the in between phase. She will take the time to make sure you are happy with the cut, and not just rush you out the door like some places.   If you want to be complimented on your "great hair style", go see Deanne! You'll always leave the salon looking fabulous!
