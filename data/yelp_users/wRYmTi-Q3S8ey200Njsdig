What a nice place to sit outside and enjoy a chicken avocado sandwhich.  The food is always good and the gold course view is kilker. Service is typically good, but the pace of the restaurant is a little slower, so don't be in a hurry to eat. If you can tolerate the retired republican coversations going on around you then it's  a 5star...I can barely keep my mouth shut at times, so it's  a 4.

Perfect little breakfast spot in N. Scottsdale. Fresh brewed coffee and ny style bagels really get me going in the morning. Try an Asiago or Cinnamon Sugar bagel; so yummy.

This is a pretty good spot for Mexican food in Peoria. We mostly come here for breakfast because their chorizo con huevos is awesome! I've had the machaca too and it's equally delicious. Sat and Sun breakfast from 8a-2p. The chips are yummy and the salsa is tasty; not hot.

This was my first time to see a dermatologist and I was surprised by how professional everyone was. The PAC Andy Hicks did my initial consult and located a tumor on my nose. He was very informative and helpful. I then went back to see Dr. Haar who did my surgery and consultation. He was amazing and made me feel more at ease. The nurse Stevie was also awesome and between the two of them, it made the whole process better. My advice, wear a hat and use sunscreen.

Super disappointed tonight. Call ahead seating for 4. When we arrived, the hostess had our name wrong and then told us that it would be 5-10 mins. We waited at the bar literally 30 mins. When I went to the front to ask about the delay, I was told that they page us but had accidently registered two pagers and would seat us right away. We are taken to our table and its dirty and full of dishes. We said we were fine with sitting in the bar and rceicwd prompt service, however the food was awful. All 4 steaks were cold and my steak was MD. Rare when asked for MD well. The baked potatoes were overcooked and dry. Finally the end is near and we received our check. We asked to have the check split and our server messed up running the entire check on one card. She voided the transaction, but the pending charge will take 24 hours to drop off. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. Happy Birthday, sorry the restaurant screwed up royally.

The food is amazing! Service can be minimal and seating is limited. Lunch is always busy, but the food and value is worth it. Try the garlic pepper chicken or the panang.

Wow what a serious disappointment. The service was really poor; waiter forgot the wine and the check and we sat for almost 30 min without food or drinks. The food was sad too. Of 17 meats, we barely got to try half and what we did try was all mediocre. Then there is the giant price tag for all of this and it ends up being a bitter pill to swallow. Will not be back; will not recommend.

The neighborhood grill that never disappoints. Great food, friendly service and live music on the weekends. Sliders are delicious and they have a ton of different  wing sauces for their tasty wings. The outdoor patio is our favorite hangout. Currently serving 4 peaks pumpkin porter for the season. ..yum!

I drive 35mikes one way just for their amazing house coffee. It's an espresso blend that will have your taste buds buzzing. It's a small local shop, so be prepared for a good size crowd and don't forget to try a chocolate croissant too.

This was my first time in the store. I have walked past it a million times, but figured I'd see what this place had to offer....a lot! Not only do they offer a great selections of affordable suits, ties and shirts, but the sales staff was awesome! David found me exactly what I was looking for and then some. I was able to get my alterations done the same day and the suit looms amazing. I will be back to stock up and update my wardrobe.

1 star is even too generous. This placed charged me $165 to change a filter, oil change and an ultimate car wash. They washed the car, parked it outside when complete, it rained and then they told me I had to use my rain check to fix their error. Then the cashier gave me attitude and said I could speak to her Manager if I wanted. I was too upset so I asked for my keys and she didn't know where they were. Stay away from this place unless you want poor service and poor quality.

I am a breakfast foodie and this is by far the best quality breakfast in the valley. Dont be sucked in to the hype of other eateries, Butters food and service is always top notch. I enjoy sitting on the beautiful patio and sipping on a latte and munching on some French toast or eggs Benedict. Completely out of my way, but its worth the drive. Get there early because the wait begins around 9am.

I've been a Wildflower fan since 2010 and I only wish I'd known about them sooner. I'm officially a bread snob; pick a flavor, they are all delicious and preservative free. Now on to food...so good! The BLT plus is my favorite sandwich on the menu; BLT plus cheese and avocado. The soups are heaven  potato cream cheese  and French onion are my favs. The coffee will wake you up in a great way and the lemon ricotta pancakes for breakfast are all you really need in your diet. Did I mention the staff is amazing as well?! Don't waste your time on the other corporate sandwich shop, this local treasure is ON POINT!

It took this restaurant a few months to get their act together and I'm happy to say I think they have. The food has always been good; nothing fancy, but always full of flavor. Breakfast is really nice; I enjoy their biscuits and gravy. They have some pretty awesome salads and sandwiches too. NW Peoria is finally starting to develop.

Great new concept to the valley. It reminds me of some other sandwich shops, but its convient, affordable and tasty. I like that the concept helps local fire fighters and the surrounding community and the staff is always super attentive.

These donuts are freaking amazing! This is the best new addition to the NW side and the worst for my waist line. The maple crullers are to die for, but get there early on the weekends because they sell out quickly.

I can't say enough good things about this delicious and authentically Italian spot. Woodfire pizza, homemade ingredients and a hip and friendly atmosphere. Their wine is made with real grapes from Italy and is smooth, bold and so good. Try any pizza, the homemade ravioli or any of their desserts; you won't be sorry.
