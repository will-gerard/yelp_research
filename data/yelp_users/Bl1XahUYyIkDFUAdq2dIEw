Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and still had to wait another 10 additional minutes for our waters.  When we asked for a lemon for a drink, the the waiter came back with a whole bowl of lemons to be rude. When they finally came out with waters and the bus boy asked if we wanted straws, someone replied yes, he threw 10 straws on the table.  Customer service has been awful and I would not return.

Great place for Happy Hour. They have a lot of their famous rolls on happy hour. The music and environment is great as well. The customer service was awesome... From the hostesses to the wait staff. Very impressive! I will be back!

We had family in from Chicago and went to Fogo last night. What a great time. The food was phenomenal.  The service was excellent.... We couldn't ask for anything better!!! The GM even checked on our experience to ensure we had a great time. One of the favorites was the garlic beef. Smoked salmon and sea bass were good too. The salad bar was really fresh and so much to choose from. I would highly recommend this place. The family and I will be back.

This is a great spot!! We went here for a work happy hour and it was great! We sat on the patio and had wine and some appetizers! The hummus is great and the cheese dip is fabulous too! Customer service here exceeded expectations. I will definitely be back!

Great brunch spot! 4 mimosas for $10.. Can't beat that! Food was great... I had the poached eggs and my friend had an omelette. The fruit that was served was very fresh. The poached eggs had a truffle sauce and a side of artichokes with prosciutto! Delish!! I will be coming back for brunch and I need to try dinner!

Checked out a new spot! This is a great location for this restaurant. You have the option to sit on the patio (they have heaters) or inside! The service was great. There were quite a few different waiters that stopped to check on us. I had the chicken raspberry salad. It was incredible. My friend had the red pepper soup and panini. She said she liked her selections, especially the soup.  I would recommend this spot to anyone and I look forward to going there again... Except next time I'll make sure to go when I'm not working to have some wine! :)
