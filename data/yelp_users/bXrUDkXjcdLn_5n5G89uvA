The gym is ok. There isn't anything really special about it. Certain machines are hard to come by during peak hours but outside those times I can always find the equipment I want. Customer service could use some major improvement. They are more interested in their phones and each other than paying members of the club. That being said I have never had an issue with this club until now.  I have recently started a new job and there are no La fitness that are conveniently located for me. I have attempted to cancel my membership several times but they make it incredibly inconvenient. The REFUSE to let you cancel over the phone, FORCE you to come in when an "operations manager" is in (10-6 when people are at work) and make you print out a cancellation form which I must mail at my expense. Don't join this club. It's not worth the hassle.

Great experience! I was crunched for time and needed to quickly pick out a belt and tie to match a suit I have at home.  I spent a minute or two wandering around alone in the men's section until a sales associate Noah offered to help me out. He was great. He listened to what I needed, took into account my personal style and I was on my way home in 5 minutes with exactly what I needed.
