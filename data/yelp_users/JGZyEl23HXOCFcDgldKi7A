To start it has one star because I have to give them at least one star....  So I never ever do this but yesterday I decided to give a "Mexican" restaurant a chance being 5 de Mayo and taco Tuesday I gave in.  My lovely friend and I go to Garcias Las Avenidas on 35th Ave and Encanto. The venue it's self is beautiful. The old Mexican hacienda theme took me by surprise. We waited about 45 min after being told it was only going to be 20 min. After being seated, I had to walk back to the bar because u can't have drink specials through the server you had to get them your self.   I ordered fajitas and my friend ordered enchiladas. Some of the worst ""Mexican"" food I have ever had. The cheese was gross, the crema was warm, the fajitas wer swimming in oil. The service was pathetic! None of the servers or bar tender wanted to be there. They close at 9 and don't inform you about that when you sit down at 845!!! The only good thing is the chips there! I was very upset and this is why "Mexican" food restaurants in my mind are the worst to go to. No one offers reeeeeal Mexican food unless it's a lonchera or a lil whole in the wall Siri can never find! Garcias is a gross display of Chicano & Tex-Mex food! The service, the food, and the over all experience suuuucked!!!!

The food is very good!!! I've never had authentic Pho but if it doesn't taste like it does at this place I don't want it! The service is good. The chef/owner is awesome! The food always comes out in a simple yet delicious presentation. I've only had Pho, spring rolls, egg rolls, and house rice with fried chicken. I good choice for some one that is not into soups!!
