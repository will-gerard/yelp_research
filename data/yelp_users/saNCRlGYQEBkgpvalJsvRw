Well, I have a little 2001 Ford Taurus.  My lovely silver grandma car is fantastic for the 100-200 miles I drive per month.  And now, my little car has a great shop looking after her.  I took my car in as it was time for an oil change and I was convinced my serpentine belt was about to go.  It had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous.  Turns out I had a loose oil-filter from my last oil change and dripping oil + catalytic converter = my car is about to die smell.  Virginia Auto Service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine.  It was so nice to receive a call from them saying my belt was fine and an oil change was all I needed.  It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example).  It is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car.  Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special?  Yes, but it was so worth it!  Now my little one won't be getting an oil change for another year most likely, but my service advisor, Robert, asked me to please stop by every three months so they could check out my belts, tire pressure, etc just to be safe.  Now THAT is service!

Always a destination when the family is in town from Colorado.  As for me, I'm spoiled, just three short miles north on Central.  You just can't beat a breakfast of a lovely hot Chai latte and a bagel and cream cheese...all for about $5.  LIke I said, I'm spoiled :)

Update 9/25/07 - Received a phone call from a salon manager today.  The $85 I spent to get my haircut corrected (not to mention the time) will not be reimbursed.  She stated over and over again how they offer a 100% guarantee...apparently not.  She just didn't understand why I wasn't willing to risk yet another haircut with them.  I told her I just didn't have faith in their services.  I don't think you should either...  Update 9/20/07 - I got another cut and color in August.  Color was wonderful as always.  Cut was atrocious.  It was kinda in the $8 super cuts range.  I hardly trusted them to give it another go.  If you did this once, why would I let you take scissors up again?  So, I headed to Rolf's and $85 later, I had a real haircut and style.  Sent a letter to the management of the salon...still waiting to hear back from them...

After reading the reviews, I just had to check out the Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe.  I was not disappointed...  What a crazy little place!  I went with my brother and a friend.  I had the yakisoba (noodles with vegetable and sauce), my brother had the Udon noodle soup with tofu, and his friend has the tuna.  All three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful.  We couldn't stop raving about the flavor.  Who knew noodles could be so magical or tofu so flavorful?!?  The service was actually quite wonderful.  Our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like.  She also brought us the cool appetizer bread basket...banana bread, little cinnamon toasts, and rolls.  She also helped up each pick a desert :)  Just an odd little place, Japanese and Italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an Eiffel Tower decoration and a bright red British phone booth???  Check it out :)

Best "personal" burrito in town!  I ALWAYS get the chicken burrito with medium salsa and cheese.  The great thing the burrito tastes the same today as it did the first time I went in over 6 years ago.  And...the same cool guy is making my burrito over all these years.  It is always so nice to go in and see his smile!  The meat is flavored and cooked well, the salsa incredibly fresh, and you can't beat the cheese.  This place tops any other "build-a-burrito" joint you have ever been to.  Tons of burrito choices (regular or whole wheat tortillas), tacos, quesadillas, taco salads or "burritos in the biff" which is a burrito but in a baked tortilla shell.  PS.  You can pick up a beer or margarita here too :)

Wow.  Incredibly easy to work with.  Very friendly on the phone.  Confirmed everything about three times very clearly yet the phone call start to finish was 5 minutes or less.  Receipt emailed.  I would love if all customer service over the phone was so easy!!!

I saw another review this place as great, so I had to weigh in.  It's crap.  I wish I liked it, but I can't imagine have any worse Italian food.  I would rather just have a bowl or cereal at home.  If you want food without flavor, this is your place.  I guess the building is cool looking from the outside...just don't venture in!  I hate being such a downer, but we all need fair warning.

Yeah!  Real, good Mexican food :)  My dad and I went there for dinner this evening, spurred on by the reviews right here on yelp.  Great atmosphere, authentic Mexican toucans everywhere.  The margarita was pretty good, especially considering it was $1.25!!!  Had the Texas Burro special for $5.55, beef and bean burrito covered with cheese and enchilada sauce with plenty of rice and lettuce.  My dad had his covered in green chili.  He said it is the only Mexican resaturant he has been to in Phoenix with green chili.  My dad loved it, and that is saying everything.  He always complains about Mexican restaurants in Phoenix not being good enough, but with Mi Patio, he was in love!  I'll be going back soon :)

The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)  Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.  I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever  I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!

I am soooooo in love with Pie Zanos :)  Is it bad I have eaten dinner there the past 2 nights in a row?  At Pie Zanos you can create the craziest pizza you can think of.  They have white or wheat crust to choose from, tons of sauces (alfredo, red, BBQ, etc), cheeses, herbs, flavored crusts, and a whole array of meats, veggies, and fruit...I love pineapple!  So, I have gone with the alfredo and pesto mix sauce, the three cheese blend, tons of fresh garlic...and I mean tons, and for the topper, pineapple for the past two nights.  It is all I ever wanted in a pizza, cheesy, garlic-ky, and with a bit of sweet on top.  My brother went with pesto alfredo, three cheese mix, garlic, basil and gyro meat.  I know, have you ever seen that as a topping option.  This is what makes the place so great!  This is the time of year to enjoy the outside seating.  Perfect day or night with people wandering around Town & Country.  As for the frittatas, I had one a few months ago on a lazy Sunday morning.  Personalized and perfect just like the pizzas :)  So, if anyone wants to talk me into having another one, just let me know!

The best tomato soup in Arizona (you can't always fly to Anchorage to get the best-best!).  You walk in, place your order and pay, and then find a table or booth taking your "number" along.  By the time you get your drinks at the self serve station and get back to your table, your appetizer will most likely be there :)  I always order the bowl of soup and an extra pieve of garlic bread.  Fills me up just right, and for $4, can you go wrong?  Whoever I go with always ends up getting a sandwich or pizza with a small side of soup and then says they should have just had what I had.  Their food is good, but the tomato soup is unbeatable.  In the warmer months, enjoy the smoke-free patio out back.  For those fall nights, they will light up the fireplace and turn on the outside heaters.  Great restaurant for lunching alone or with a friend or the whole fam-damily :)

Rolf's is always a great salon for those new to the Valley.  Service is always consistent.  It is always hard to find that new stylist who will do your hair right.  Whoever your appointment is with at Rolf's, expect a great job.  A hair cut and blow dry will run you about $45 to $55 plus tip.  (Note: tip must be made by cash or debit card, no credit cards)    I have been going to Cameron at the Arrowhead location for over two years, and my haircuts are always perfect!  Highly recommended for those in the Northwest Valley :)

Food not worth the wait. Stood in line for 50 minutes just to order. Saw the (presumably) owner headed out for the day stop and chat with some people in front of us in line. Mentioned just how busy they have been. Saw the obviously long line and didn't do anything to address the situation. Yep, the entire time only one of their two order windows was open. One.  I guess I'm the sucker and the joke's on me.

How have I not written about Bombero's by now?  I figure it's a perfect time as I sit here now enjoying a perfect evening yet again...made even better as I look up and Josh is pouring some wine moving his cute self to the music.  The atmosphere at Bombero's is second to none.  Beautiful interior, seductive patio, amazing service, delicious paninis and bruschetta for lunch, dinner or snack to share (after a splendid breakfast of course!), and music which puts me in a perfect state of mind.  Come with a friend, come with a date, have a business lunch or coffee and everyone is welcome to come single...sit at the bar and delve into conversation with one of the regulars...perhaps it will be me!  Seriously a good place to be any time of day, starting with an omelette and latte at 7am or going late night for a glass of wine and desert.  Oh, and there are Happy Hour specials this summer which make it even more enticing.  1/2 price glasses of wine 11am to 6pm and then the last two hours before closing.  All beers $4 during this time.  Free wireless and pet-friendly patio.

Burgers were excellent (both BBQ bacon cheese and peanut butter bacon) and fries were even better. They cook burgers to order instead of chain-style aka overdone. Staff - I think one was probably the owner - was super friendly. Fun environment. Great shaded tables outside which are perfect this time of year. Very clean. Another win for the local scene!

Eat here!  Bring your family and friends here!  My husband would make fun of the concept of an enchilada place as we drove by, but one I night I said we were eating there anyway and he loved the food as much as I did!  I've had both the chicken and the beef and both were delicious.  Green sauce recommended!  I've heard from others I have taken that the spinach and mushroom filling is even better than the beef.  Only issue is the line can get a bit backed up with all the options they have and people going in their first time.  It would be great if they could also put some guidance as to the options on the glass between the customers and the enchiladistas so you didn't have to keep stepping back and looking up.  I plan on going back at least weekly...and I don't think my husband will mind either :)

Aaron's continues to be a popular place for people to park. I hope he keeps his business open as it is always so busy. Looks like some sort of bike gang might be trying to take over this fine establishment though. Not sure if I am happy about this or if I should be afraid.
