I've found people either love or hate this place. I love it. Great food. Good portions!  Always friendly service.

We love In and Out a lot. Great for the family. Good food at a reasonable price. Always clean inside.  Sometimes they are so busy their isn't a place to sit down, but that is just a testament to how much everyone else loves this place as well.  TIP: Next time you order a burger or fries try them "Animal Style"

The store is clean. Very peaceful and quiet. Overall nice in those ways.  Last Sunday I went online and found a book I wanted for the same price as Amazon, what luck?!  I went to the store to buy it and found it was $20 more than listed online.  Because this didn't seem right I went and asked an employee (first off they were not nice and acted as those I was annoying them), they sold me something about online and instore not being the same and there was nothing she could do for me. I left annoyed. I took time out of my day to go to their store to buy something, and would not help me.  Following that encounter, I emailed BarnsAndNoble.com about what had happened. It has been 4 days since and no reply. So I went online today to "chat" with an employee. They gave me the same "It costs less online because you pay the shipping". This answer is nonsense because I was offered Free Shipping for the item.   All in all, Barns & Noble at this location was a waste of time, and the customer service just says the same nonsense. I have been forced to buy the book on Amazon which I hate because B&N wanted to charge me $20 over their online price.

I visit Fry's almost daily for my lunch. I love how they are open at 5am. Also, for being store made Sushi. Its really tasty. The cashiers in the early morning are also very friendly, which is refreshing at such an early hour.  Also since they have put of the solar panels... almost every parking spot is in the shade. LOVE IT for this terrible AZ Heat!  TIP: In the back east corner of the store (past the home decor area). There are hidden sales items. You can from time to time find some really good deals back there. Check it out!

I love this place. Always smiling and friendly staff. The Sushi is the best in the valley for the price.  Went there again last night after not visiting for 6 or so month... and all I can say is that I do not go to this place enough.  TIP: If you are a lover of sushi rolls with a kick, the Blue Flame is a must.

Its a food truck in a parking lot in a shaddy area of town?! Can it be that good?!  YES. YES IT CAN! If you are near by, stop and eat here. In a rush? call them and place an order, it will be ready when you get there.  My favorite is the Carne Asada Quesadilla "with Everything". SOOOO GOOD!!!  Warning: Cash Only.

Stopped in here while at Dave Ramsey's Smart Conference a few weekends ago. It was packed and it did not seem the staff was ready for such a large group of people. The line ran out the door.  However, that line was SO worth the wait. The food was really good, and the staff super friendly and nice. I will for sure go back again next time I am getting lunch in Downtown Phoenix.

First time visit. First impression was the people were very friendly and helpful with my order.  Ordered 3 different style of small tacos. Carnitas, asada, and green chile chicken. The green chili chicken was my favorite, however all where very tasty. Also ordered a carnitas quesadilla that was super good as well.  I will visit this place again soon.

I hate this company. I used them once and now they never stop harassing me. I've asked them over and over again to stop, but they still call me about once a week. Also when they call they never leave a message. WHO DOES THAT?!  I see a few people have given positive ratings in the last few months, they apparently are not getting all the calls yet.  AJ's Auto Glass, I will update this review to a better rating if you promise to stop calling me and give it to me in writing. THANKS!  UPDATE 02/19/2015: Many months later, still calling me about once every two or so weeks.

The food was meh. Overpriced for just "meh" food. Felt shitty afterwards. Never going back.
