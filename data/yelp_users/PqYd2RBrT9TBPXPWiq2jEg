This place is amazing!! Just the people that work here are always half asleep. Not energetic at all. I LOVE the wheatgrass shots, seriously I always need to drink the 2 oz shot when I eat unhealthy or when I'm hungover. A great fast way to detox. I love to get anything that has an anti-oxidant. I also like to get the turkey sausage and egg breakfast wrap. One thing is that this place usually is never busy so they're fast! over all if the employees were to be a bit more bubbly I would give this place 5 stars.

I LOVE this place! it's almost been a year. Never have they ruined anything. They have always taken out stains that are stubborn. Its a tad bit pricy but it's worth it! Customer service is great! also they're pretty fast! They have same day service.

Very good food! Great service! I recommend the California salad! Their new wings are amazing! I order delivery from here all the time, and they're super fast! It's gluten free pizza, almost guilt free pizza

Amazing food! Crab legs are to die for but the service sucks!!! It seems like all the employees here are deaf!   this place would have 5 stars if the employees could check on us once in a while. Took forever to waive someone down!!!

The first & last time I come here. I got acrylics and they left it on my cuticle. Worst job ever. They made me feel so uncomfortable. Asking me so many questions, I felt like she was playing 20 questions basically. Turns out she was the owner. Worst nail salon ever. Save your money! It was a pedi and full set acrylics. My total was $110!!! So plain. No designs or crystals. Beware.

It's ok. It wasn't good-- wasn't bad. I did see a lot of flies tho. That kinda grossed me out. But nothing special AT ALL. I was expecting more out of this place because of the location. Blue Hound, Breakfast Club are great restaurants. Also Gold's Gym in that area is so nice. Then there's this sushi place and you think like... wow thats it? I went here when it was super empty and they still took forever with my meal. I would NEVER go back here. I recommend "How do you roll?" thats in the same area which is a custom sushi shop.

This place is hands down the best Italian food I've ever had. Service was amazing! When you walk in it feels very cozy, very LA. Of course it was busy! But we got a table in 10 mins. I ordered a "Vespa" cocktail at the bar while we waited for a table, and it was perfect! It's sweet and it had a couple raspberries! Then I ordered the Pomo pizza, the lasagna and a canoli. Everything was delicious! So flavorful! I will definitely come back again very soon! I'm just so lucky that its super close to where I work:)
