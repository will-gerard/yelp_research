I went to Bergies during my morning walk with my dog. I called ahead and asked if she were allowed on the patio and they said yes, just poke your head in and let us know you're here and we will take your order. So as I got there, the young brunette handed me a menu and served me outside while being extremely friendly and helpful. The coffee was great and reasonably priced. I was sold!! So, the next day during my walk, I poked my head in to ask for service outside because of my pup. What I got was a complete opposite of the day before. There was a man sitting behind the bar who made it very apparant that I was interupting his day, who told me I could tie my dog up and come in and order and as I tried to tell him I couldn't (she is young and too hyper) he interupted, obviously annoyed, by asking what do you want? I then told him "actually nothing." and went across the street to Liberty Market where I was treated respectfully by a staff that has a clear knowledge of customer service. Too bad, great atmosphere outside.

Does your Dentist have massaging exam chairs??? Smile Again Dental does!!!! If anyone is looking for a dentist, my husband and I just had the best experience at Smile Again Dental. The staff and doctor were so great and we will never go anywhere else again!
