Dear AJ's,  When I worked at the Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs down the street from you, you were the only thing I had to look forward to in the day.  There were a gazillion restaurants I could have eaten at on site, but they all sucked shit and treated other employees like crap for some reason.  You were my half hour reprieve from that god forsaken place, where I could escape the whiny assholes who'd come up to the front desk and my puffy-cheeked manager who'd roll his eyes if I wanted to smoke a cigarette.  Remember when I would come in twice almost every single day, once for breakfast, once for lunch and then you'd see me drive by at the end of the day and I'd wave and almost get into a car accident because I wasn't paying attention to the road?  Ahhhhhhh...  You're the only store in the valley that I know of that sells Cock and Bull ginger beer, quite possibly the best there is in the world, even better than the really good Jamaican stuff. [ *if anyone knows of better ginger beer, cough it up because I am in love with it* ]  Your other selections of gourmet sodas were all excellent choices too.  I really like your sandwiches, man; they hit the spot just right.    I wish I'd met you under better circumstances.  If I hadn't hated my job, you would have seen me smiling through the aisles.  As it was, you probably saw me eyeballing one of your many fine wines, contemplating if I should get drunk and tell my boss to go fuck himself.  Don't worry, I didn't.  I did quit though and immediately celebrated by eating a sandwich outside of you.  I miss you a lot.  I don't really drive my car very much anymore, and if I did drive, no offense, that's pretty much the last part of town I'd like to be in, aside from obvious ghettos.  Perhaps I could move you, brick by brick to a new location that is closer to me?  No?  That's fine.  If you're not comfortable, I won't press it any further.    With that, I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  I'm still a member of your sandwich club and have the card in my wallet.  It will be used again, old friend.   -Billy

I can't possibly say anything that hasn't been said about this place.  Amazing salsa.  Lovely smell.  Chewy, gooey tortillas that they make in the back and you can see them do it.  Whenever I finish eating food from Carolina's, I cry a little... gentle, muffled sobs.  They provided the food for an event that I had at work.  Luckily, some of my clients don't like tamales or delicious little burros, so when they left, I ate more than I should have.  Their pansiness is my benefit.  If I could, I would make sweet, sweet love to Carolina.

I have to tell ya, man, I really, really like this place.  Sitting inside, even though it gets incredibly packed, is a comforting experience.  There's something about being in Phoenix in the Spring, before it gets too hot, munching on a burrito and wincing at the blinding sunlight bleeding in through the door that just makes me feel incredible.  People will bitch, and let them bitch; if they don't like this place, stay the fuck away, then.  This is MY joint.    Pretty much the best thing they've got going on there is the green chili cheese tortilla.  It is something to behold.  Every single time I've been there, I've ordered one.  Even if what I order for lunch is plenty, I will have the green chili cheese tortilla for later and I'll zap it in the microwave and nom on it hours later.

Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls.  The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive.  The strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck.  Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else.  Even if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it.  Five stars.  Places don't get much better.

Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.  The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  "You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!"  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.    This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.  The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection.

James' review of Harkins on Shea is the best review I've read and I'll moreover just sort of reiterate what's already been said.  Camelview 5 is typically the theater you can rely upon when there's a movie with limited release playing in Phoenix.  It's your go-to destination to see low-budget, imaginative movies that don't have an audience as broad as your typical Michael Bay, logic-out-the-window, blow-stuff-up-real-good type flick.    I love Camelview 5, but there have been movies of specific interest that I wanted to see but never made their way there.  Most recently, Camelview 5 really dropped the ball on a the independent sci-fi flick "Moon."  Not a great movie, but definitely worth a look and has more thoughtful emphasis on artistry than 90% of movies that get a large theatrical release.  I saw "Moon" at Harkins on Shea.  It isn't playing anywhere else in the valley, sad to say.  The theater itself is an older theater.  You can tell by the seating.  The screens are a bit smaller.  For some reason, I dunno if this just me but I felt like it was cleaner than a lot of theaters, too.  It had a great ambience, sort of celebrating a love of movies, not just a theater for viewership.  It felt warm.  It felt great.  On top of that, it has a great location.  The people who work there are awesome.  I disagree with James on the grumpy old ticket taker.  The old man tearing my ticket stub reminded me of the elevator operator from Barton Fink, with the whole monotone delivery.  To me, he was not grumpy, he was just a character in a weird sitcom or something.  Fantastic.  I enjoyed my time and I think it's a great place to hit up if you're wanting to see an artsy flick and a total no-brainer in one fell swoop.

Ahhh.... the Stab Lab.  This was a sad, sad, sad time in my life.  I've got the plasma scars to prove it.  Someone once asked me if I had ever been involved with heroin because of the scar tissue bunched up on my veins.  I can't say I ever had a "pleasant" experience donating plasma.  I give this place four stars because it saved my ass, not because it was a magnificent way to spend my saturday.  When I didn't have money for food, this place gave me money for food.  I'd stock up on mac & cheese, buy a pack of smokes and two forties.  I was good to go, man.  You go in, they prick your finger and get blood out of it, then you lay down on a bed in the back and they stick a SPIKE (not a needle), a friggin' SPIKE into your arm and you pump and pump until all this blood comes out.  They spin the blood in this machine until clear, water-lookin' liquid comes out--that's your plasma--and they put the blood back into your body.  All the while, they have a movie playing for you, usually a movie you would never consider renting, something like Monster in Law or Hitch or the Great Mouse Detective or something.  At the very end of the ordeal, they replace your plasma with saline.  I can only describe that feeling as getting injected with mentholated blood.  Your mouth gets all cold and you feel a little sick.  But hey, you just scored out on some hard, non-taxable cash, so the feeling fades once you walk around for a little bit.  The people you meet there, you are not likely to forget.  You will always have a story to tell your friends after a day of getting stabbed.

Oh, fuck off D.C.  I wrote a funny review based on an experience I had a lifetime ago.  I was 18-19 and had a hard time finding work with how limited my experience was in just about any field.  To supplement my income, I donated plasma.    "I'm sorry that Billy used CSL as a means of getting drunk and did not take care of himself during his time donating and might feel cheated somehow, but overall it can be a very positive experience."  I gave the place four goddamn stars and said they saved my ass.  What the fuck do you want?  A chapter in a book about my life about how angels literally greeted me at the door?  I never said I felt cheated.  I didn't use it as a means of getting drunk, I used it as a means of buying food and having a couple beers with my friends later and taking the edge off... god knows you need to when you only have tens of dollars in disposable income.  Write about your own fucking experiences and leave me the hell out of it.  I had an experience, you had another.  Two minds and two souls have two different experiences in this universe, yours went one way, mine went another.  You say, "The "people you meet there" are normal people. Pretty forgettable."  Yeah, that was YOUR experience, not the one that I had.  My experience involved seeing a man having a seizure, the spike popping out of his arm, and a literal jet of blood spraying out of it.    I gave the place a positive review, but noted the negative side effects you seem unwilling to accept might happen to someone else and shit all over my experience that I had.  Fuck that jazz, boss.  That shit's rude.  I drank and continue to drink, but I'm not stupid enough to spend my life in a drunken stupor.  I'm not an idiot that forgets to drink water.  I don't feel cheated, I didn't feel cheated at the time, I only had minor discomfort which other people may experience.  Don't lay your sanctimonious bullshit on me, you don't know me, have never met me and have no idea how far the fuck off base you are.

I stopped into the Horse and Hound to wet my whistle one night before I saw a show at the Clubhouse next door.  I looked around and I thought that the décor was alright, it was a little tacky but I like to have my bars a little on the tacky side.  Keeps shit edgy.  I saw that they had shuffleboard there and virtual bowling.  Everything looked quite promising.      I started off with a vodka and Red Bull.  The drink was watery, but I didn't mind too much because I seem to remember it was pretty inexpensive.  I played me some virtual bowling and discovered that the trick to do well is to put the least amount of effort into the game as possible.  Once you start caring is when you start fucking up.  All night, I was determined to have a good time, dammit.  I don't like not liking places.  I can overlook shit.  Bathroom smells funny?  That's okay.  Vomit on the light switch?  Kind'a gross, but okay.  But the bartending staff was so rude to me that it was ridiculous.  It felt to me as though I was not welcome there.  My friends and I asked this one middle-aged lady bartender where the discs to play shuffleboard were and she said, "Well, did ya look over there?"  I don't mean like, "Oh, did you look over there?"  I mean, balls out, nasty, "Did ya look over there?" with the same offended gestures you might expect from someone if you'd just asked them if they bleach their butthole.  In truth, no, no we didn't look over there; we decided to ask first due to our geographic location being situated closest to the bar at the time.  Big goddamn deal, just answer the question.  I was gonna get a drink but realized that I was standing under a sign that read:  "Do not stand here!  Your order will NOT be taken!"  How inviting.  Once my drink was finished I asked the bartender if I could have another drink.  I tapped my glass and asked if I could have "another one of these," to which she replied, "What's another one'a these?" with the shittiest tone of voice you can muster and her head indignantly shaking at me like I just spit in her face.  Every bar I've ever been to, my bartender knows what drink I had last.  If they don't know, they ask me and they're nice about it.  Bartenders are supposed to be nice, for God's sake.  I was also pretty high as I had only moments before smoked a ton of pot and that was a major buzzkill for me.  Nothing un-highs me like someone being completely unreasonable.    If I would take more than two seconds to order, I would get an audible, raspy sigh.  "Hi, could I get... hmmm..." *gaaaawwwwwwww!!* Perhaps it's better on different night.  I don't know.  I'm not real anxious about coming back.  Instead of being shitty, treat me like a human being.  I'm like the easiest customer you can get, so to be shitty is really lame.  I've never given back a burger, never complained about a drink and kept my lips zipped that time I found a dead rat in my fries.

As a bar, this place actually has the propensity to be something incredible.  As it is, it's really chill and great and I like to kick it there when I have a chance.  With a few slight modifications, I could picture Time Out Lounge being transformed into my permanent hang out.  You ever seen that movie Mean Streets?  I could totally see me being Harvey Keitel and Time Out Lounge being my permanent hangout spot.  I love the amount of pool tables and the dartboard and the internet jukebox.  I like the whole layout of the bar.  It's very cool and most of the bartenders are really nice.  One of my favorite touches is the tables that have endless amounts of various graffiti in the form of "fuck you's" "so-and-so was here" and strange political points and counterpoints that it all blends together into a nonsensical collage of intoxication.  Brilliant.  The bathrooms are awesome.  There are murals that have a lot going on.  It's really fantastic after you've had a few pitchers.  If you're ever in this part of Tempe and want to have a couple beers and shoot pool, Time Out will do a damn good job.

I know I'm not the first and I know I'm not the last person who has or will throw up at the Palo Verde on their 21st birthday.  I came in their already blind drunk and the bartender served me a gigantic, obscenely huge shot of Jagermesiter on the house.    Throwing up at the Palo Verde is hitting rock bottom.  It's like admitting to smoking crack before work.  In case you've never been there before, here's the rundown:  It's disgusting.  There's a mop hanging up outside that's gotta be in the running for "Dirtiest Mop in Tempe," second only to a mop used for a murder scene... although I can't say for certain that the PV's mop hasn't done the same.  The bathroom... my god.  One time I went in there, and there were flies on the toilet paper.  Once, I had diarrhea (I know! it was bad!) and some fat guy snorting cocaine sparked some conversation, "Man, I've been going to bars for 18 years, never had to shit in one before, though."    The bartenders are hilarious.  The one guy, Chuck, looks like he'd beat the shit out of you for wiping your nose wrong, but he's as nice as anyone I've ever met.    The drinks are stiff.  Ten bucks will get you more absinthe you know what to do with.  Chances are, you will stumble out of the PV, jump on your bicycle and wind up home somehow, giggling like a madman.  I love it there.  I would give it five stars, but I had to surrender one due to the "punching machine," they installed and the classic rock that some douche-nozzle always puts on the jukebox.

After a brief hiatus with the Palo Verde, I returned.  For a while there, I was seeing the same people time and time again and I feared that I was becoming a regular so for months I stayed away.  I came back over the weekend and I'm glad I did.  When you go to the PV, sometimes there's a band playing.  Man, the PV does not need a band to be playing there.  The place is tiny.  When people are dancing and singing and what have ya, the temperature inside increases by maybe fifteen degrees.  The humidity raises.  It's disgusting.   Other times, the place is just too crowded with douchebags who scream, "WHOOH!" each time they do a shot, and of course they won't just do one.  No.  If you say whooh, chances are you like saying it and you're going to use any and every opportunity to say it.  You'll take a shot to say it, you'll put a song on the jukebox you like or meet eyes with an attractive girl.  Whooh!  Saturday night, I feared that maybe these two options were in effect.  But, no.  It was dead and I sat there for a few hours with my sister and my friend and we kicked back, watching Dinocroc and then Dinocroc VS Supergator.  Unfortunately we missed Supergator by itself but we did see the ultimate VERSUS match.  I shot the shit with the bartender/owner Chuck for a bit.  I asked him how much he thought the movie Dinocroc cost to make and he said, "I dunno... not as much as E.T., not as much as Star Wars, but probably more than.... Blair Witch?"  Chuck told me one time he tried call Domino's Pizza because he had the number memorized.  He fucked up on two numbers and accidentally called 1-800-Condoms  I convinced him to call 1-800-pee-on-me and he did.  I saw his face sour and he was like, "Ah, man, nice sound effects...."  It's a great bar.  I love going there, it's just such a nice, chill atmosphere and the drinks are dirt cheap.

This is a great place to knock back pitchers.  If you can get yourself a table at Bikini, you've got it made, buddy.    I like the diverse crowd of hipsters, grizzled old dudes, tough guys and the occasional homeless guy who comes in with a pillow, asking you where they have blankets.  That's a true story.  And then he started singing along to a Michael Jackson song, but didn't form any words whatsoever.  He sort of looked like N!Xau from "The God's Must be Crazy."  I'm gonna miss that guy.  In the restroom, one of those miniature XXX things tumbled out of the vending machine.  A gift from God!  Or, so I thought.  Free half-inch in diameter porn!  The instructions told me to rub the chick's binki until it went away, but that didn't work.  I tried using a quarter like it was a scratch-off or something, but I just ended up mutilating it.  It was macabre.  In a weird way, I felt like Lenny from of Mice and Men.  I tried to be gentle, but I accidentally killed her.  This place is great.  I always have a very, very good time.

I was an asshole when I wrote my last review.  "[M]y beans were, if not from a can, pretty damn close to it in taste," is probably the winiest goddamn thing I've ever written.  Mi Patio is bomb as fuck.  I went back four years after my last review and I'm glad I did.

This place is surrounded by car dealerships and the closest other "business" is a place where people who got in trouble by Johnny Law have to talk to counselors about why they got in trouble in order to appease the court and have their crime forgiven.  Anyway, that's just kind of setting the scene for this place and its surroundings.  Burger Mania is just sort of depressing.  It has weird decorations, like this Uncanny Valley hot dog statue that is covering itself in mustard and ketchup and looking right into your eyes, begging to be eaten so that it can end its miserable life.  It wants the sweet, sweet release of death so badly.  For some reason, below the neon sign reading "Burger Mania" with burnt out letters, there's these weird, I don't know, mascots, one of which is a dinosaur.    All that said, the food is actually pretty good.  It was kind of amazing!  It's nothing extraordinary, no, not by any means... and if you're expecting that from a place called Burger Mania, god help you... but, grading on a curve, they deserve four stars.  Given all the places that look as depressing as this one, hardly any of them actually deliver on any sort of promise to actually have good food.  This one does.  And it's pretty inexpensive.

My boss brought me here and bought me bread as a treat. I wasn't too hot on the idea of getting a piece of bread as a snack but once I bit into it, I wanted to curl up with the roll that I got and sleep with it for days. It slapped me in the face with deliciousness. I got this roll that was stuffed with jalapenos and cheese and baked perfectly.  The guy working there was really awesome too.  I got some free samplers of this turkey and cheese-stuffed bread that was pretty bomb as well.

I was mildly okay with Julios because it was cheap and it never made extravagant claims to being very good.  It's greasy, overly-cheesed "Mexican" food that's bad for you.  Sometimes that's what you want... the large, lousy portions for not much money with shredded bits of iceberg lettuce.  Make no mistake, it's not good, but sometimes we all have our guilty pleasures and sub-adequate Mexican food happens to be one of mine sometimes--usually when I'm hungover or something.  Last time I went there, I popped open a little salsa container for the chips and, Jesus Christ, it was a solidified gelatinous cube.  It wasn't frozen, either.  It was gelatin.  It was this... ugh.  It was denser than Jell-O, too, you could slice it with a plastic knife and it would continue standing on its own.  And that's when I realized that what I was eating wasn't just bad food that's fun to treat yourself too every couple of months or a few times a year, I was eating a pile of failure.  The novelty was gone.  It's all fun and games until you see that salsa.  It's like having fun drinking in a dirty dive bar, then you fall down on a pile of broken glass.  The fun's over... clean up the glass, guys.  Start making fucking salsa in a food processor and take some goddamn pride in what you do.

All this motherfucker has to do is apologize.    Read Yolie's review.  The owner fucked up.  You know what?  Shit happens.  I've acted like an asshole before.  Someone does something to piss me off on an already-bad day, sure.  I get that.  What pisses me off is that he won't admit what the fuck happened.    Dude acted like a psycho and terrorized my girlfriend and I slept on it.  I went to bed and slept so that I wouldn't freak the fuck out on him, having hindsight on my side.  I went in the next morning and asked him, "What the fuck?"    This is where shit gets surreal.  He goes, "What?" so I say, "That shit with my girlfriend yesterday."  And he tells me he was making room for her in his parking spot.  Okay, straight up, this is what I saw:  The owner, Joe, of Lunch Express, acting like a fucking asshole, trying to ram my girlfriend for parking in his parking spot.  That's the deal.  I saw this shit and it can't be mistaken as a simple miscommunication.  But, that's what he tried to pass it off as, like oh you're mistaken!  I was trying to be a good guy!  Joe, a personal letter:  I went to Lunch Express before you owned it.  I've been eating sandwiches there for eight years, and all of your employees are nice as fuck.  Your delivery guys?  So nice.  Your cook?  I'd give him a fucking TV show if I could, he's so goddamn funny and quick-witted.  You?  You're a nice guy!  I've been talking to you for ages in idle small talk for years and I always thought the best of you.  But that you won't even admit you were an asshole?  What.  The.  Fuck.    I'm a little embarrassed that I yelled at you, but not THAT much, on account of you're a cunt.

PF Chang's ain't bad.  Granted, it's not the best food I've ever had but there is a lot to like about this chain and the food IS of good quality.  I like the following:  1.  The lunch bowls are really inexpensive.  You can get a decent lunch bowl and soup for like 8 bucks ($7.95 to be precise).  That's pretty cheap, man.  I mean, come on.  8 bucks rarely even buys you a 12-pack of beer anymore.  2.  The to-go containers are awesome.  I bicycle around and, to date, no hot soup has spilled down my back.  It snaps together and, VOILA, you're good to go.  3.  Overall, it's pretty fast.  If you work close to a PF Chang's, call a little bit in advance, get it to go and, man, you're set.  Sometimes the people who work at this location think too highly of me and don't realize I'm a fatass.  I'll order my food, the lunch deal and sometimes two spring rolls and they'll give me two forks and two fortune cookies (actually I got three fortune cookies today).  They either think I'm ordering for two or that I need two forks to shovel the food into my mouth twice as fast.  If I were ambidextrous, I so would.  Celebrity sighting!  I saw Frankie Muniz outside of this location, too.  I looked at him as he walked by and I was like, "Is that the kid from Malcolm in the Middle?"  I cocked my head like a dog who heard a whistle and he looked a little panicked, like he thought, "Ah shit.  This guy knows who I am."  I didn't say anything cause he was with his chick and I had to fart.    But, hey, Frankie, that sweaty guy who had to fart used to watch your show when he was in school.

From early on in the day, I had it planned out that this was the bar that I was going to come to.  It's a nice ride from my house to here, right along the Green Belt.  I was pretty stoked to try it out because I'd passed by it a million times but had never been inside.  My girlfriend said that she'd been inside before and thought it weird and depressing and wasn't sold on it, but finally I was like, "C'mooooon..." and she gave in.  Fuck my ass, she was right.  I kind of wish I'd listened, but I'm also sort of weirdly glad that I did end up going because now my curiosity is sated.  When we came in, we grabbed a seat and the waitress asked us what we'd like to drink and we weren't quite sure yet and asked to see a menu and to just have a couple waters for right now.  Before we even got the waters, she asked me to start a tab with my card, which I thought was weird because, I don't know, what if I ended up not getting anything?  She also asked me really shitty, too, like she had some weird (and incorrect) sixth sense that I was gonna rip her off.  Oh, well.  So, we were chillin', my girlfriend and I, just waiting for her to come back to take our drink order and she just... she never came back.  We saw her walking around and talking to other people and bringing them pitchers of beer but she, like, literally never came by to take our drink orders.  I'm not sure how long I waited, but I smoked an entire cigarette and listened to an obnoxious and terrible Guns and Roses ballad that was particularly cocaine-inspired (and someone inside turned the goddamn volume up from a 3 to an 11), so maybe 11 minutes?  I ended up going inside--I really wanted a beer then and there--and taking my order from the bar.  The bartender was busy and didn't get to me right away, but I understood.  She looked very busy.  I saw my waitress come inside and go behind the bar and I expected her to jump in for the bartender and be like, "Hey!  What can I get you?"  Instead, she spent something like a solid minute just drinking from a styrofoam soda cup.  I had my wallet out as a signifier of "look! money!" but she just, uh... it was really weird.  I looked right at her, and she at me and we made eye contact while she was sucking on the straw and it was a battle of wills.  It was a staring contest.  I finally broke away and lost because I felt weird.  The bartender came up to me and asked if she could get me anything.  Two beers please!  She helpfully told me that a small pitcher'd be cheaper and I get a little bit more.  I told her I had a card on file and my waitress was like, "He's at [service industry code for a table I'm at that went over my head].  I'm helping him."  "Oh, you're helping him?"  The bartender asked.  "Yeah," The waitress responded.  She looked at me and back at the bartender and just shrugged her shoulders and motioned toward me.  "I... I don't know."  Like I'm the fucking asshole for waiting enough of a long goddamn time and getting the drinks my fucking self... well, not myself, but from the bartender.  You know what I mean!  I will award this place two stars because I liked the bartender and because that was one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had.  It will live long in my memory.  When I'm old and senile and running around the yard like Willy Lohman, I will be recreating that beer in my mind.  "Ah, delicious!"  I'll say to no one.  "What a beautiful day in Scottsdale!"

I've been having a torrid love affair with Grimaldi's.    Where I work, there's a little deli downstairs.  I eat there pretty much everyday.  The food there isn't great, but it's right down stairs and I feel at home there and they have soup and salad and stuff.  My little office deli has been closed for the holidays.  I am a creature of habit, so I've been having to venture off to fend for myself food-wise.  I felt like pizza--I was hungover, mind you--so I used Yelp to find something.  I typed in my zip code and "pizza" and Grimaldi's popped up.  When I was ordering, in a groggy voice, with a headache, I think the phone conversation went like this:  "Grimaldi's, how can I help you?"  "Yeah,"  I said.  "Do you guys deliver?"  "No, we don't."  "Shit.  Um,"  I googled them and saw they were like a three minute bike ride away.  "I'd like to put in an order for pick-up then."  They asked me what I wanted on my pizza and I went with the usual sleazy choices.  They told me they didn't have canadian bacon.  I was like, what the fuck?  I asked if I could get bread sticks.  No bread sticks.  I was like, fine.  Just the pizza, then.  When I rode my bike there, I realized, "Oooohhhhh, this is a fancy place.  I had no idea."  I'm a dirtbag, so, to me this place is pretty much like my idea of upscale.  I rode my bike back to work with one hand, the other hand on my pizza.  When I got out of the elevator, these people were like, "Grimaldi's?  Mmmmm!"  I finally dug in.  It was delicious.  Seriously.  I can't imagine pizza tasting much better.  If pizza were better, my taste buds would react in a confused manner and I think the result would be a negative experience.  This is a delicate balancing act of being delicious without creating a transcendant experience into a foody hell.  I thought the pizza was overpriced until I tried it.  I ate the whole pizza by myself at work.  I ate Grimaldi's and, since it was super slow that day, I watched The God's Must be Crazy.  Easily, one of the best workdays I've ever had.  Since then, I've been there to eat another pizza and a huge, baby-sized calzone.  This is a great place.  The help is always nice to me, even though everyone's dressed nice and I come in all red-faced and sweaty after locking my bike up to a street sign since I was not able to find a bike rack.

This is where you go when you want to pretend you're a real life cowboy.  The funniest part of this place is the plaque on one of the cannons actually used in the movie "Wild Wild West" and that they're proud of it... authenticity be damned, this cannon was used in a movie that involved the Wild West and a giant, robotic spider.

I pass by Super Burrito everyday on my way to work.  One morning, my stomach was a-grumblin' and a-growlin' and so I decided to stop and check this place out.  I decided that if I'm gonna see this bitch on a daily basis, I should at least introduce myself.  Inside was pretty okay.  The interior reminded me of Fat Burger, right down to the jukebox and the angry-looking Mexican dude behind the counter. As soon as I walked in, I remember being deafened with Banda music.  It was playing about as loud as it could have been played, about as loud as those cars with the bass cranked up so high that it sounds like it's farting down the street.  I got my old, classic favorite while I was there:  The California Burrito.  Carne asada, potatoes, chilies and cheese.  They browned the tortilla just right so it was slightly crispy, but not crumbly and not dry.  The tortilla was big and thick too, which led me to believe that they probably made it there.    If Super Burrito were a girl, she'd think I was pervy the way I ogled that burrito.  It was really good.  I think I'll pop in more often and wolf down some burritos.  Bonus is that it's open 24 hours, so if you have the beer munchies or the pot munchies or the regular, I haven't eaten in a while munchies and it's 2 am, you can grab a burrito and gain repletion.

You know what, man?  I LIKE China Wok.  I've been here a few times and whenever I go, I get a mountain of food.  I always forget how big the portions are, so whenever I see the final price at near $10 I'm like, damn, kinda pricey for American Chinese Food... then I get like two deals of rice, an egg roll and a fortune cookie that doesn't tell me any sort of fortune whatsoever ("the closes distance between friends is laughter...." but what does my future hold, cookie?!).  Inside is totally fine.  I've been to a lot of quick-stop Chinese food places with flickering lights that hum nauseatingly and have a dirty fish tank with a single beta fish who I can tell is contemplating suicide.  Here, though, the inside is a little cheesy but it's clean, fun and doesn't make my head split open.  They also deliver, which is always good to know.  Also, in the shame shopping center is a 4:20 evaluations thing, so if you're suffering chronic pain, you can self-medicate and then nom out with your, uh... mom out?

Ye Olde Poppe Shoppe... hear ye, hear ye... ah, never mind.  Pop the Soda Shop is fuckin' awesome.  You pay per bottle of soda so unfortunately it's not the cheapest thing in the world, but considering the excellent quality of the sodas that you can get and their rich, amazing flavor, it's well worth it.  You'll drink one and belch yourself into a soda coma for a bit.  I'm with Tim on this.  Dublin Dr Pepper is awesome.  I even had to read about it on Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Dr_Pepper  "The Dublin plant is the nation's oldest Dr Pepper bottler."  "thus, the only way to purchase Dublin Dr Pepper is by coming to the Dublin area, ordering it online, or finding a store outside the area which sells "bootleg" Dublin Dr Pepper (product purchased in the area then taken outside the area; the plant in Dublin doesn't keep a record of who might sell it across Texas and beyond)."  If Dublin Dr Pepper sounds good to you, this is the place to get it, as well as a variety of Sorpanos-themed Italian sodas, a gazillion different kinds of ginger beer, real cola, goddamn, it's the best place in town.

Z'Tejas made me realize that I should eat brunch more often.  It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end.  You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal!  Come on, Z'Tejas, there are ten pins in my heart, you've knocked over eight.  Won't you please pick up that spare?  I ordered their breakfast-y enchilada and it was pretty amazing.  It had an egg on top and spicy sauce and it was served with a muffin and fruit.  Enchiladas, eggs, muffins, fruits.  And iced tea.  The combination of flavors was kind of a shock going from here to there but it was fantastic and I loved it.  I've ridden past this place again and again and again.  People have spoken about it on Yelp.  People have told me how awesome it was.  Seeing it out of the corner of my eye going down mill, I never made the connection that it was there.  Because of the red, squiggly "Z" in front, I always assumed it was a cell phone company.  I don't know.  It just looked that way to me.  I'm glad I finally checked it out.  On a lazy, hungover Sunday, I'll be back.

Cheba Hut is the culinary equivalent of writing 4:20 on your binder.  Each time I enter, I wince with embarrassment as I see the walls littered with marijuana-themed posters and action figures.  I have a personal theory that most of the drug slang this place uses comes from those awareness pamphlets that they hand out at high schools.  The reason being, their slogan is, "Where the only thing fried is the occasional customer," and they toss other puns around like "toasted."  I don't think anyone's referenced someone as being "totally fried" or "toasted" for a good 25 years or so.  Their interpretation of stoner culture is very much whitewashed and made fun for the whole family.  The ambience is not very pleasant if you are, in actuality, stoned.  They usually blast heavy metal really loud.  Even worse, it's a heavy metal radio station so you also get to hear idiotic radio banter.  Talk about a buzzkill!  On the flipside, Cheba Hut's sandwiches are really good.  They are delicious.  There's no doubt about it.  I remember the first time I came in, they asked me what kind of bread I wanted and I asked what my options were.  The cashier told me they had garlic bread.  I then said, "Whoa, that sounds bomb."  He then said, "Yeah.  It is.  It's really bomb."  You know what?  He was right.  I always have to fight rolling my eyes, though when I look at the menu because, man, every single thing is pot-themed.  It gets to be a bit much and I always feel like a jackass when I order, "Yeah, uh, could I get an 8 inch endo?  Duhhhhhh...."  I do also like that there's only one drink size.  I don't have to put any thought at all into what lid I'm going to put on my cup.  Cheba Hut in a nutshell:  Embarrassing theme, really good sandwiches.

I was really glad that I stumbled into this place.  I enjoy reading comics but I've never been an afficionado, never someone with an encyclopedic knowledge of all Marvel or DC sub-plots and whenever I come to most comic book stores, the help I get varies from total snobbery (think Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons) to incredibly helpful and enthusiastic (dudes at Ash Ave.).  The people who work here are as great as you could ever hope to expect and as an added super-big plus, they have a lot of single comics bundled up so that you can buy an entire series for a percentage off.  I love having the whole collection without having to buy an anthology or like a lumped-together graphic novel or something.  For something like $38 bucks they had pretty much the entire Spider-Man "Black Suit" saga from the 1980's.  Love it or hate it, it was the whole fuckin' thing.    I ran into this place randomly coming back from the Chuck Box.  I had no idea it was there and it was a total gem.  I'm really glad that I found it because it's among the best that's around.

Cafe Lalibela is fantastic.  I love eating there because the food comes super quick and it tastes delicious.  It's healthy, tasty and fills you up for a long, long time.  I am, in no way, an authority on what makes for good Ethiopian food but I know what I likes, and this place I definitely likes.  I dig the atmosphere and the music that's always playing that totally makes me think of a smooth jazz station in Africa or something.    Yesterday I went and got some grub here.  The food came quick as usual and it tasted extraordinary, as usual.  But, man, there were these damn kids running around.  These people sitting across from us must've brought like 8 goddamn kids with them.  Somewhere between 8 and 10 totally bad kids that ran around and were loud and singlehandedly gave me an aching headache.  If I wasn't a pussy, I would have told them that they're selfish, yuppie fuckheads.  What are you thinking bringing that many kids to a place without a ball-pit?  Kids don't wanna eat at a quiet restaurant, they want to jump around and swing around and shit before totally passing out somewhere.  That's what kids do.  I don't blame the kids for being bored... I'd do the same shit.  I blame the parents for being such retarded, wanna-be cultured fucks.  "We'll bring our sophisticated children to get African cuisine.  Mmmmyeessss.... that's what I plan to do with my afternoon."  There's not much the dude who works there could have done, unfortunately.  I mean, people who let their kids act like assholes would freak out if he told them that the kids were maddeningly loud.  They'd be like, "We're not paying the bill, shall never come back and will tell people there are rats in the food.  Whole rats.  No, it doesn't make sense but it's gross."  Aside from that one incident, the place is great.  I love it.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like.  Something tells me that with the monster gas this place gives me, I'd be super healthy and would benefit from hitting 'em up on the montly.  Fantastic-O.  Five stars.

Harlow's gives me diarrhea.  Every time.  Every single time.  You know what, though?  I don't care because Harlow's cuts my hangover directly in half and I feel twice as good when I leave.  If I get me some diarrhea, that's okay.  It's a price I'm willing to pay.  Their food is diner food.  I mean, what you get is going to be a little on the greasy side and you'll taste it in your burps for a few hours.  Some of their food might cause some slight indigestion.  I, however, kind of enjoy heavy ass diner food that settles right to the bottom of my gut.   When you order a water and a coffee, they'll be filled constantly.  I mean constantly.  At most places, you drink maybe altogether two cups of coffee throughout the course of your meal.  At Harlow's, if you really wanted to, you could burn through like ten cups of joe.  I've been to this place with some gnarly hangovers I can't even begin to explain.  One time I went here so hung over that it felt like I coming down off of a crazy psilocybin trip.  Harlow's makes me feel better.  A LOT better.  The ambience is a little douche-y and kind of conservative-Republican and they make the waitresses wear those embarrassingly small shorts and I get diarrhea whenever I go here.... fuck it.  I still like it.

My only complaint about this place is that they NEVER open on time.  One time I psyched myself up and I was like, "Okay, Sunday... I'm buying a comic," and they opened like an hour late.  I assumed they were out of business so I went home and I was going to call and see if I got a message that said they were sorry, but unfortunately closed due to blah blah blah.  Someone answered, to my shock, so I biked my ass down there and finally got me some comics.  It's not that big of a deal because I'm lazy too.  I know how it goes.  Plus, Casey Moore's is right there.  I used my idle time to have a couple beers.    It's a cool place.  If you don't know what to get, ask the dude working at the register what you're into and you'll leave the store with an obscure comic you've never heard of but in the end are glad you finally learned about it.  I bought two comics... one, a comedic, indie masterpiece called The Fart Party, which I thought was the FRAT Party until I got home.  I'm glad it's fart because I don't like frats much, but farting is normal, human and appeals to my inner immaturity.  The second comic I bought was called Dogs & Water which is a surreal journey into I don't even know what the fuck.  It was awesome, though.  It's great to browse, too.  I used to be a huge Spider-Man fan when I was in my youth and spent a good hour looking at Spider-Man comics and parts of an incomplete series I had when I was like twelve.  So good.  I'm going to be back and, by God, I'm gonna get me some Spider-Man comics.

This place was really fantastic.    My friend had to ship these bicycle frames that he sold on ebay.  It was a pain in the ass, man.  Seriously.  I don't drive a car anymore, so we had to bike over there and pick up these boxes from Tempe Bicycle across the street and lock up our bikes and carry the bicycle frames with the boxes we got for shipping.  It was sort of logistically confusing to think of how we were going to get everything together.  Luckily, we were not hungover or high so it went pretty well.  Our initial plan was to go to the UPS store and ship them out from there.  So we walked across the street and to the UPS store and the goddamn place was closed because of light rail construction.  Ordinarily, I'd have been pissed.  Ordinarily, I would have screamed, "Fuck!"  For some reason, I didn't.  Something clicked.    I told my friend, "Hey dude, remember when I used to do market research a couple years ago?  Well, I did a study on how all Kinko's are changing their names to Fed-Ex Kinko's and, though I'm not entirely positive, I'm pretty damn sure they all do shipping too because Fed-Ex bought 'em out."  Huzzah!  They do indeed do shipping.  And it was awesome.  The ladies working there were helpful and nice.  The cashier ringing us up forgot to charge us for all the bubblewrap that we used and she said that she'd just comp us on it.  Free bubblewrap! Yaaaaaayyy!!  They let us use the screwdrivers they have for sale too; we just used them and put them back.  About six months ago, I also printed my résumé out here and was indifferent because it was nothing special, certainly not yelp-worthy.  On this occasion, they really went all out and made this whole pain-in-the-ass-project pretty great.  If you need to ship something or, like, make a bunch of copies of flyers, go here.

I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place earlier.  I always assumed that I had, but when I went to see what rating I gave it, I saw that I never wrote a review.  When I want pizza delivered and it's sometime before 2 a.m., Tessio's is generally my go-to place in Tempe.  Every single day they have some sort of awesome special going on so sometimes when I call I'm just like, "Hey what kind of special do you have going on right now?" and for not much money me and some buddies can plug our beer-filled guts with some greasy yet oh, so delicious pizza.  You don't have to be drunk to appreciate Tessio's, but you know how pizza is.  When you're faded, it always tastes a little better.    One time I had a night to myself.  All my friends were off doing something I didn't feel like doing, so I was alone.  Home alone.  For the first time in years.  I ordered up a basic pizza from Tessio's, smoked a lil weed and by God I watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie and fell asleep on the couch with a greasy face.  I love this place.

It's a strange thing:  I first moved to Phoenix in 2004.  I moved to Southern California and then BACK to Phoenix in 2008.  While in Southern California, I was legitimately homesick for this place.  I missed how easily accessible everything was.  Phoenix may indeed be a spread-out city but that's nothing in comparison to So. Cal.  You can easily make it here without a car.  We have the light rail and a pretty decent bus system.  The Orbit in Tempe is free, for God's sake.  A lot of things made me miss the place.  One thing in particular, as strange as it sounds, was Dilly's Deli.  Before I moved away from Arizona, I had only eaten at Dilly's twice and both times it was an amazing experience.  I love that they put the sandwich on that thing that simultaneously grills and smooshes my sandwich into this toasty creation of genius.  The prices are more than I feel like paying most of the time, but every so often I get a ghostly smell of Dilly's all up in my nose... a nasal memory of something.  It's like my nose is zoning out and decides to remember how certain things smell.  Sometimes, Dilly's becomes so fresh in my mind and it weirds me out a little bit.  This place is perfect for dining under a lot of different circumstances.  It's great for days off where you slept in way too late, it's past 11:00 a.m. and you're starving.  You'll plug your gut up good.  It's good if you just hanging out, too.  I always liked the interior.  I always enjoyed just chilling and taking my time and eating there, waiting for 6:00 to roll around to hit up a movie or go to a show or something.  If you have a buddy coming in from out of town, Dilly's Deli would be a good choice to bring them to for lunch.

Delicious.  This is Mexican Barbeque at its purest.  You have two meat options:  chicken or beef.  There's no fancy orange-spiced, or other-spiced flavors here.  They offer two things and those two things are so good.  The chicken was greasy, but you know what?  I didn't care.    The main attraction was the beef.  It was so good, I didn't want it to end.  It was one of those moments where I hadn't eaten all day, and when I dove it, I was silent.  I wouldn't have answered my phone.  I got the most expensive thing (I think) that they had there and it was like seven dollars.  It came with chicken, beef, onions, tortillas and beans.  The beans are, meh, so-so and the tortillas are perfunctory but the real star is the barbeque, that's what you come for.  The chicken is greasy, but TASTY.  The beef is perfect.

Their hours overall are kind of sucky.  Like, I don't think they're open on Sunday.  I love pizza on Sunday.  Oh, how I do.  Sunday is my lazy day (I don't do shit!), so having a nice piece of pizza pie while I dutifully color an Aladdin coloring book or watch MST3K flat on my back is great.  They're also not open very late.  If you only want Otto's on a Friday night, you're fucked.  However, they are very good.  I love their pizza.  I love it.  I ate there not too long ago and the pizza was not nearly as good as it was in the past, but it was a fluke, thank God.  It's not pizza that's going to be world famous, but there's a certain and specific taste to the crust, the cheese, the toppings... I don't know what.  It's taste made for me and I want to have a large pizza made for me, the size of a car, baked all around me, and I want to eat my way out of it.  Also, I love their desserts.

The biggest problem that I have when I need to take my bike to a shop to have something fixed is that bicycle enthusiasts are, for the most part, incredible douche bags.  I apologize in advance if you are someone who wears skin tight shorts with a padded ass and a colorful shirt adorned with fifteen different product logos.  Sometimes when you take your bike to a shop to get new chain put on, flat tire fixed or something else along those lines, the people working there will treat you like you just crawled into the store on your hands and knees and promptly crapped yourself before spouting off some nonsense about needing your bike fixed.  Or, worse yet, sometimes they will act like the bicycle had only been invented with their prior approval.  They are the people who know bikes.  You think you know bikes?  You don't know shit.  These guys know what they're doing.  But, when you take your bike in to have little metal piece on your bicycle seat fixed, they'll fuck it up even worse than what you had it before and shrug it off with an attitude that says, "Well, shit, you should've bought the $600 seat if you wanted me to fix it up.  My fingers were made for the finest gold."  Tempe Bicycle throws that pretense out the window.  They are incredibly professional and courteous even when they're busy beyond belief.  When you come in and you need to have them fix something they will deal it to you straight without suggesting that in order to be a true bicyclist, you need to dress like a fucking clown and mount up on a bike that costs more than a car.  Even non-profit organizations can leave you groaning sometimes the way they treat everyone indifferently, but Tempe Bicycle, specifically this location (not so much the other one), they will get your job done very well.  Just recently I had them put some grips on my bike using their air gun, squirt some air into my tires and lube up the chain and they did it for free even after I offered to throw like five or ten bucks their way.  Very professional and courteous.

I reather enjoy this place.  The food is overall pretty damn decent and it's not expensive.  The crab puffs are really good.  I wanted to crawl inside of it, camp for three days and eat my way out like a tarantula wasp larva, but I had work....  It goes without saying, but the service is incredible.  Everyone mentions it.  The lady who works there gave me soup on the house simply because my girlfriend ordered a meal with it and I didn't and didn't want me to be lonely and without something to eat.  That's rad.  As I was leaving she also gave us free cookies.  Fuck yeah!  Each time I've been here, there've been loud-as-hell people for some reason.  One time I went and there must've been, a World of Warcraft convention in town or something because there was a table full of kids with plastic battleaxes telling jokes with such punchlines as, "Wookie bowcaster," and "Purple light sabers!"

Top's is amazing.  I love going there.  Their beer selection is fantastic and the customer service is awesome.  You don't feel like you're at a store.  You feel like your friend just so happens to own a liquor store.  You will get no scornful looks from cashiers for coming in already drunk.  One time I popped in and some salesman was there, wearing a Russian Commandant uniform, trying to sell Kalashnikov vodka.  "He made AK-47's and vodka, too!"  What a guy.  I didn't buy any.  The way I see it, Top's, if you're gonna have a salesman in your place, that was the guy to have.  I was pleasantly weirded out.  I vouch for Top's.  It's a great little liquor store.

The best part of Monti's is that each table you sit at is secluded and private, with a wall on either side of you to keep your conversation between you and your friends.  I don't particularly care if people can hear what I'm saying, but I do enjoy the privacy.  Monti's is laid out strangely.  As I'm sure everyone knows, it's in the oldest building in Tempe.  It's a relic.  A dinosaur of a building.  If you know me, you know I love dinosaurs.  Since the building is old, they did with it what they could, and I enjoy the hectic, "Where the hell is the bathroom?" feeling you get.  Without fail, for some reason, whenever I go to Monti's, I feel stoned.  I think it's because rooms and different sections are placed so randomly throughout the building, I feel like I'm waltzing through M.C. Escher's imagining of a 4th-dimension steakhouse.  It's not the best steak in town, but it's good and you get two sides.  If you get a potato, they will bring you a goddamn potato.  The sides are big and the bread that they start you off with is pretty tasty.  I'm a sucker for rosemary.  I like that it's dark, I like that the building is so old you can imagine someone, 150 years ago, getting shot in the throat over the last bite of steak.

Last night was the first time that I ever ate at House of Tricks.  Well, one time I had a piece of a leftover while I was drunk out of my gourd, but that just wasn't the same as actually being there and experiencing the beautiful ambience, having the plate brought to you and getting to pet the fat kitty that lives on the premises.  Right now they're got restaurant week going on and for $30 bucks you can get a gnarly three course meal.  I got:  Coconut curry shrimp, Asian meatballs served over a bed of goat cheese and a dulce de leche cheesecake brownie for dessert with a cup of decaf coffee.  Unfuckingbelievable.  Sometimes when you eat food that is that good, something that soars into that level of greatness, it makes every dish you made that you were oh, so proud of look like a piece of shit.  Did you ever bust your ass and cook something that took all day?  Did you ever make your own turkey stock for gumbo you made and the whole affair took all Sunday and you never even went outside?  I'm sorry, but you're going to be a little depressed after you eat here because it was incredible to an absurd degree.    Dude.  Amazing.

Buying pants from here is less reliable than Goodwill.  Sure, the pants are a hell of a lot more attractive at Buffalo Exchange, but I bought a pair of slacks and a pair of golf pants... both of which tore in the crotch.  My slacks lasted about a month but my golf pants lasted all of a day.  One day.    It's unacceptable to charge what they do and then sit down, here a rip and realize you've just gotten yourself a pants-pussy.  Pants-pussies are embarrassing.  You can't safety pin it shut, because it's awful close to the testicular region.  Dude, it's not like I'm performing acrobatics so why all this tearing?    I bought a pair of shoes and they lasted me about a week.  Seriously.  I got out of my car and realized that the foot I used for the clutch, where my foot dipped in, the leather cracked and split.  The other shoe followed days later with the same cracking and splitting.    Some of the cashiers are really nice, genuinely awesome.  The others are rude as shit.    One time I saw a chick square dance while she was in line in front of me.  Like... square dancing.  Thumbs in the belt loops and all.  I felt like I was either a) on a hidden camera show or, b) in a Fellini film.  Buffalo Exchange could be a lot better if the clothes were in better condition, they threw out like half of all the bro shit that they have there and lowered the prices dramatically.

I didn't really notice until my girlfriend said something, but it's totally true:  We, being from Southern California, are used to having a burger joint, a greasy hole in the wall, everywhere you go.  If you go to the bank, there might be a little burger stand inside.  When you wash your car, reach your hand through the window and hot wax and grab a beefy little snack.    In Phoenix, not so much.  There ARE burger places, but most often, they're a chain:  In N Out, Five Guys, Smash Burger, Fat Burger, Whataburger, etc.... and while they all vary from being pretty damn good to at least not embarrassing, it's just not the same as going to some little hidden gem, tucked between two buildings.  You have great, gourmet places like Fez, but, like I said, it's not the same.  To be honest, it's something that you really start to miss about "home" even though it hasn't been home for you in a long, long time.  I've ridden past the Chuck Box quite literally, hundreds of times.  It's right on my way home from work tucked somewhere into my peripheral vision and had been ignored by my brain for YEARS.  It wasn't until my sister recommend we pop in before a movie that I even knew it was there.  I'd seen the sign, but my brain never connected the dots.  This place does help to fill that void.  Not 100% but the burgers were really, really good and I love the set-up to actually see your burger get made.  Then you add your own garnishes with their floating island thing.  The price ain't too bad and the decor inside is warm and cozy.  In fact, I plan on hitting it up tonight.

Reading through the massive number of reviews that Casey's gets, lots of people have a great time here and some people have unfortunately had a terrible time and depending on which night you go, each scenario is a possibility.  Most often, when coming here, I've had a pretty good time, even when it so crowded you can't sit down and your elbows are literally touching like the back of a stranger.  I like to come in the afternoon or on an off-night like Wednesday night (it is Wednesday, so I may partake).  Their selection of beers isn't staggering or anything, but the food there is actually pretty damn decent and they have a fair number of appetizers to choose from that aren't too heavy.  Like I said, sometimes I've been here on days where it's totally bullshit.  I remember I came here once with my girlfriend at the time and we literally didn't get served for about thirty minutes.  I would've bailed but it was her first time there so I was like, "We're gonna do this shit."  The same waitress who took her sweet-ass time spent maybe like three seconds talking to and then on her way to get our beers, she stopped at a table with these dudes with British accents and giggled and slapped her knee and sat there for like maybe five minutes.  I was like, "Oh, great... our waitress is a whore for accents and two dudes with British accents are here.  We're fucked."  Yes, I admit, the English are quite charming, quite, but sonofabitch, man.   For like the longest time, that waitress would always be there when I was there and no matter where I sat, it was her section.  And there she was, takin' forever and lookin' mad at me.  Haven't seen her there in forever so I've lucked out.  You know, it's easy to complain, but most often I've had a really good time.  I love the atmosphere outside, the misters in the summer and sipping on a hot coffee in the winter.  All year round, it's fucking awesome to be there.  I love sitting by the koi pond, sipping on a beer and watching the fish go by.  It's a relaxing place when it wants to be and a fuckin' madhouse when the time arises.  It's one of the best landmarks we have in Tempe.

Fry's beats the crap out of Best Buy any day of the week.  At Fry's, you're hell of a lot more likely to run into mutants, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.  Their camcorder and digital camera selection is totally awesome.  They have the newest stuff that Best Buy, for some reason, never carries.  At other electronics stores, the best thing you'll see is some P.O.S. HD camcorder for like $900 that really looks no better than your average camcorder.  Fry's, however, has the real shit.  Canons.  The XL2.  An XHA1 on display.  Professional equipment.  I spent like a full hour and some change checking out their movie section.  It's massive.  They have so many DVD's that it's kind of on the fringe of ridiculousness.  When you're browsing you'll fully see a movie you vaguely remember as a child.  I can't remember the name of it, but at Fry's I saw that they had this weird movie I saw when I was like five about a babysitter who feeds babies to an evil tree.  Seriously.  Remember that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when the camera pulls back and shows the ark among an endless series of boxes?  Well, that's what Fry's is a lot like.  The place is frantic.  The decor is totally blah and laid out like shit, but to me that sort of adds to its charm.  The lines are set up like you're one of a hundred cattle being lined up to have a metal bolt shot into your skull once that blue light flicks on and a cashier waves for you to come on down.

Overall, Zia is a nice place to get CD's and movies.  I've had some negative experiences a few years ago, but nothing like that has happened since.  There used to be this air of snootiness with some of the cashiers, but I haven't encountered anything like that in a long time.  It was especially the case when trying to sell DVD's.  I was broke as shit and needed to sell off some movies and the dude I was dealing with told me a special features disc on a box-set I had was damaged, so I couldn't sell it as a box set and I got less money.  I watched the special features, like, ONCE and I take really good care of all of my DVD's, so what's the fucking deal?  I think they did it so that they could sell the movies individually and make more of a profit as they'd be easier to sell.  I know that's a ballsy claim, but look at my DVD collection.  Spotless.    It also used to be that your collection of music or movies would be scoffed at.  Don't scoff at me, motherfucker!  My taste rocks the shit, it's your taste that sucks, Mr. Avant-Garde-I-Only-Watch-Fellini-Followed-up-by-Jodorowsky.  If I want to be scoffed at, I'll try to sell Wal-Mart jeans to Buffalo Exchange.  Anyway, like I said, nothing like that has happened in a long time, so it's a lot more pleasant, less snooty.    Just so you know, this is not a place to buy new movies.  Their new releases are outrageously overpriced.  I've seen some Hollywood mainstream fare selling for like thirty bucks, when I know damn well at Best Buy it's probably going for like twenty at most.  Anyway, whatever, this is a place for used movies.    In reference to their movie selection, they don't have a lot of classic movies.  I couldn't find The Wild Bunch, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Night of the Hunter.  Depending on who sells what, some pretty decent shit will roll in.  It took about five visits, but they finally had Trainspotting and I snatched it up but quick.  When it comes to music, they've had just about everything that I wanted.  It's easy and I've always gotten what I wanted from various musicians.  I'm not a big music geek, so I've never looked for anything too obscure.  I'm a movie geek.  I can't be both, I don't have the time for two obsessions, but I do love my music.    They have what I want, which may or may not satisfy your needs as a music geek.  They have T. Rex on vinyl for cheap.  I've seen some Tom Waits on vinyl.  Basically any artist I enjoy, they'll have their CD.  It does the job.  One major complaint:  Every time I go to Zia, there's always, ALWAYS some goober who is standing so as to block an entire aisle and won't move his ass.  I don't like saying, "Excuse me," I think you should just know better and kindly move the fuck out of my way.  I know it's not Zia's fault, but goddamnit... every fucking time.

You can't browse a yelp talk-thread without hearing mention of Fez.  You hear Fez is amazing.  You hear Fez is overrated.  I decided to kind of zone out what everyone had been saying and try it for myself and see what I thought.  My friend came in from out of town and I wanted to take him somewhere sort of out of the way.  Just to show him around.  We ate at a few places close by, but I wanted him to get a full-on Phoenix experience.  It was brutally hot out that day, too so I wanted to show him, basically, that Phoenix isn't necessarily the Devil's armpit.  There's cool stuff, too.  To make it complete, we took the light rail there.  It was a strange journey getting there.  First, the goddamn kiosk fucked me out of two tickets.  I paid for 'em but I didn't get 'em spit out.  I told a light rail security guard and he just said, "Drop my name..." if asked to show my ticket.  Seemed dubious, but I never got asked to show my ticket so it sort of worked out.  Then, once on the light rail, this annoying drunk dude and drunk chick were being totally belligerent.  They wanted to know somewhere fun to go.  Every place I dropped, they were like, "We're not going there!  We don't want to go there!  That's not what we're doing!  What the fuck?!" and started to really get on my nerves.  I finally told 'em I wasn't their tour guide and to piss off... especially if you're gonna be rude about it.  Finally, we got to Fez and I was like, "Man... I'm sorry that it's super hot and drunk people are being bitches."  We got in and it was pretty great right away.  Immediate seating and it was super air conditioned and I could feel my sanity slowly pump back into my brain.    I order the burger that's loaded with mushrooms and it was very, very good.  Everyone says to try the sweet potato fries.  Sorry, but I skipped.  I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but I did have their spicy fries and those little fuckers were amazing.  Our waiter was so attentive and awesome and willing to bullshit with us, it made the experience a whole lot nicer, balancing out the oddness of the day that preceeded.  I always have to mention a restaurant's bathroom.  I love it when they decide to make the can a place to enjoy.  Fez's bathroom was amazing.  Dessert was amazing.  Brownie covered in ice-cream.  I wanted to marry it, but my dad would freak out and my mom.... she'd just sit there.  Based on my experience, it's a nice place to go and I would definitely go again, just to try their different burgers and maybe test the waters with their lamb plate.    It's not expensive and it really is delicious.

Carly's is magnificent.  I love it there.  I've been there maybe five times at this point by now and I don't know why I haven't written a review earlier.  I made my way back to Carly's for the first time in maybe two months or so.  For some reason, everything on the menu looked SO damn GOOD.  It took me longer to order than usual.  I'm quick at ordering.  I look at the menu, see something and BAM! it will be in my stomach, being dissolved by acid, very soon.  This time, though, my god.  I wanted to eat everything.  It all sounded so bomb.  I ended up getting a sandwich with salmon on it.  Can't remember what it's called.  The service isn't the friendliest, but it's certainly not rude or curt.  It's just sort of indifferent which is fine by me.  Hell, in some instances I downright prefer it.  The waitress took our order and gave us our check and filled up my ice tea.  I didn't feel ignored at any point.  That's all I want, man.  Sometimes I feel like service is insincere when a girl my age calls me "hun."  You know what I mean?  I mean, sometimes a chit-chatty type of thing is okay, but for the most part, when I eat out, I'm just gonna chill out.  The price for what you get is really fantastic.  The sandwich you get isn't the size of a plate, but it tastes amazing and your salivary glands will have a bit of an orgasm.

It took me a long time to get around to reviewing Camelview 5 and I think it's just because I had mixed emotions at first.  It's a little too corporate, I suppose, and since it's pretty much the only theater in town that you know for sure is going to have movies first released in limited theaters, it's going to be packed.  I can't really fault it for that.  I'm not sure what it is, but I've never been too crazy about coming here.  The smaller theaters?  I dunno.  Maybe it's because what I really want is an independently run theater that allows me the opportunity to get a chance to see 127 Hours or Moon when it's still fresh and brand new?    That would be the dream, but until then, this theater is AMAZING to have around.  Plus, I get to use my loyalty cup for $1 sodas, so the whole conglomeration thing isn't all bad.  If you're excited about a movie coming out, but you know it'll either take a few months to make it to more mainstream movies, or maybe even fizzle out and appear on DVD, this is your go-to place (A Serious Man, The Maid, Son of Rambow, Broken Embraces, Black Swan).    Watch out for olds!  They'll take forever at the box office and sometimes when you get up to pee, you'll have to old the door for like six fogies.

The salsa they hand you with the chips tastes like, I don't know, Agent Orange?  It doesn't taste good.  My tostada was swimming in a pool of grease.  My enchilada was decent.  The taco I had gave off an aftertaste that was remarkably similar to a fart.  It had a crunchy shell that can cut up your gums.  Goddamn, everyone who works here is so nice.  I feel bad giving it two stars but the food was really, honestly, not very good.  I am not a picky eater, really.  I am easy to please.  If I tell you a place has lousy food, then man, you are gonna shit your pants.

Penzey's is a great place to go when you know that you want to make something special but you're not entirely sure what.  They spices and herbs are all top-notch so whatever you make is going to be incredible.  Even if you're a shitty cook, you can make something palatable with the help of Penzey's.  So, you don't know what to make for dinner.  Look around.  Saffron?  Saffron sold in grocery stores smells like DayQuil and is ineffective.  The stuff you get here is the real deal.  A tiny little pinch will make your rice golden and delicious.    Okay, so, you have saffron.  What next?  A fresh vanilla bean?  I'll use that vanilla bean to make the best vanilla ice cream I've ever made in my life!  Look around a little bit, smell this, smell that... orange peel?  It smells so GOOD!  Okay, so, using that I can marinate some pork chops and have these amazing orange-zested pork chops along with lovely saffron rice and vanilla ice cream for dessert.  It's THAT fucking easy.  Seriously.  You can plan entire meals, including dessert, all around the various spices they house here.  AND the spices are all amazing.  Their paprika will make you piss on the shit you get from Safeway or Fry's.    My parents used to order stuff through their catalogue which was always really, really cool.  They have amazing accessories too like really well-made pepper grinders and salt shakers.  Having the store to actually go to is an amazing experience.  I'm a seasoning-smeller, I admit it.  I could spend all day smelling their bay leaves, cinnamon and sage.

This place is great.  I've hit it up a few times and really enjoyed my time here.  The food is really rich.  One sandwich will fill you up and you'll stayed filled up for quite some time without feeling like shit.  The service is really nice and they offer honest suggestions.  If they think something isn't so great, they'll tell you what they think is better.  I love that.  Usually, I feel like restaurant staff are obligated to tell you that every single food item and beverage has been kissed by angels and blessed by God.  Here, you'll get some honest input and end up with a dish filled with awesomeness.  Their iced teas are all great.  They're super refreshing.  I'm gonna hit this sucker up on the weekly when it gets to be frying-balls hot in Phoenix again.  I haven't had their beer yet.  Everytime I've gone it's been on my lunch break at work, so I'm hoping that they are fantastic.  I went to sit outside and some lady was like, "The only thing about sitting outside is that you can't drink beer out there."  I told her that was fine, I had to go back to work and she told me the beer was bomb.  We shall see.  If you're in the area and feel like eating healthy, Mandala Tearoom is a pretty good option.  Their sandwich called "The East," man... I want to make love to it.

The Clarendon is a hotel with a real level of charm to it.  I've been to a lot of hotels and most of them, most of the higher-end hotels that cater to a lot of business travelers are so dull and lifeless that it's almost extraordinary that you could deliberately suck all of the life out of your hotel's decor.  This hotel does have some genuine life to it and it's the small things that make the difference, like playing music underwater in the pool.  Better yet, playing AWESOME music underwater in the pool like The Cramps.  I've always liked staying at hotels in my own city.  It's fun not being home, it's like having a sleepover as an adult without having to crash on someone's couch and wake up the next morning with a fucked up back and shoulder.  Gallo Blanco is a big reason to enjoy coming to the Clarendon.  They make a mean michelada.  Throwing dill in there is a great idea, it adds a pickly taste and a bite that just takes the drink to another level.  I guess my only real complaint is that it's a bit overpriced.  I booked the room for 80-some bucks which is, you know, whatever.  That's usually kind of the standard rate for a hotel room in the mid-range, plus it came with a high-def flatscreen TV (no HBO, though).  A lot of high class hotels continue to have shitty TV's in the room and it boggles my mind.  Still, when we checked in, there was then a $15 per-night fee that included two bottles of water in the room and snacks at the front desk, which is like... man, couldn't you build that into my hotel room price initially?  So with that and a lodging fee (not including tax) it ended up being over $100.  Not nearly as good a price I thought it was going to be when I first booked the room.  This is still a really fun hotel and a place I'd recommend people to stay if they're coming in from out of town.

Man, I feel kind of disgusting.  I just ate at Philadelphia Sandwich Co. and there's so much grease and fat inside of me that it doesn't know where to go.  I think it's going to swim through my veins and form tiny little hands and squeeze my heart.  I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak (what else would I get to test the waters?).  I was really hungry, so I ate the whole thing.  I got it to go and ate it at work.  About two bites in, I was like, "Uhhhh... dammit.  I have nothing else to eat."  I did check the fridge really quick to see if I would get lucky and see a leftover of mine in there.  But, no.  I ate the whole damn thing and I didn't want to.  The meat tasted, like, I don't know.  Gross?  Can something taste like gross?    The fries were okay.  They were all soggy but they tasted okay.  I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to fries.  I even enjoy those fries that look like fried shoelaces.   Overall, I mean, it's not the worst food I've ever had and the service was as good as could possibly be expected.  I ordered, shot the shit, got my food and ducked out.  Easy as that.  I feel like I'm missing something.  I feel like I'm being sacreligious and pissing on a grave for only giving this place 2 stars.  Everyone loves this place, it seems, with the exception of two or three.  Perhaps the missing ingredient was intoxication.  I was stonecold sober.  One day I'll eat there shit faced and see if I feel the same way... I probably will.  When I drink, I eat light.  Greasy shit puts me to bed.

The food here at Essence is really good.  It really is.  BUT, they're not only not open on Sundays (they serve breakfast for the love of god!) but the service is consistently just the worst goddamn thing in the world.  Each time I go there, I say it's my last time and this time I think it really is.  I don't know.  Fuckin' place always draws me back in because Tempe only has like three places to get breakfast, it's silly.  Anyway, I got the "big" breakfast, which cost as much as any normal thing called a big breakfast would, but the portions given to the namesake were a total joke.  Lil' potato cake thing, lil' pieces o' bread, lil' thingy of mushrooms.  It's cute.  It wants so badly to be big.  Anyway, I didn't get the vegetarian version and I noticed that it was missing sausage.  I brought it up and the food server was like oh man, sorry about that, it'll be right out.  I ended up eating my entire breakfast while waiting for my sausage.  I waited and waited before I finally went inside to inquire and before I even said one word, before my dumb mouth even opened to speak, everyone working behind the counter, three people, frantically said, "It's coming right OUT, sir!"  Like I'm being fucking unreasonable.  Sure.  How demeaning is that, to be treated like I'm some cheapskate fatfuck for wanting something I already paid for?  The sausage came like ten minutes, literally, after that.  I wanted to hit the road.  But, it was super delicious.    There was a dude sitting next to us outside and the chick food server he had was treating him like total shit.  He didn't seem to mind, but I overheard her really patronizing him when he asked if he could have a thing of toast, "Uh, well sir, if you wanted toast that's something you would've ordered beforehand.  It's NOT free."  She said it so shitty, like responding to a pervert who asked her if she shaved her privates.  He said he'd pay for it, no big deal.  Dude, that guy ordered a lot of food and probably racked up a decent bill.  Bring him some toast, you cheap bastards.  Essence is always packed, hot, loud and stupid.

The Cornish Pasty is sort of my go-to place when I have friends coming in from out of town and I want to take them somewhere fun.  Almost all of my friends give me the "Duh" face when I recommend we go eat at the Cornish Pasty.  "What's a cornish pasty?"  If I had a nickel for each time I heard that question asked, I'd have enough money to... I dunno, I'd at least have enough money to buy a 40 of Mickey's.  Or a can of Sparks.  There are so many different pasties you can choose.  Everything from Mexican to Greek to traditional American fare to the classic bangers and mash British faves.  And they're all good.  A lot of their better ingredients are homemade.  Each pasty has love baked right into its flaky crust.  I don't each there as much as I used to, mostly because I sort of exhausted myself, but I love bringing friends so I can relive my experience of the first time I went there.  Everyone else has pretty much already said it, but this is absolutely one of the best places to go eat.  If you've never been, you should really go.  The food is great, the beer is great and the whole atmosphere is so damn jolly you can't help but, at the very least, enjoy yourself with friends for the night.  Quite legitimately, this is about as good as it gets.

This is a great, little theater.  It only has one screen, and they show a variety of films that get such a limited release, you might not be able to see it play anywhere else but here within the valley.    When they're not playing an independent documentary or a foreign horror film, they show classics.  I got to see the movie Network at Valley Art.  I told my friend he had to see it, and if you see it on the big screen, it makes the monologues almost twice as good.  I also got to see the Apartment here.  Sometimes when I check showtimes, something really cool is playing, like Annie Hall or Fargo or whatever they feel like.  I am a fan of this theater, absolutely.  However, I didn't give it a full five-star rating for a couple of reasons.  First of all, they charge just as much as any other theater, even when they show older movies.  If they charged only like five bucks for older flicks, I'd be here every single night.    I also wish they played older movies more often.  Maybe at least one older movie a week.  Not like, old-old, like "classic," but I would like this to be a theater where every wednesday or something, I could see a glorious, big-screen version of Eraserhead or Ghostbusters or something.    I like to go out to the movies on Friday night, but there's no goddamn way I'm venturing out to Mill Ave on Friday.  I hate having to weave in between mobs of douchebags that stink of Axe body spray.    I would absolutely recommend this theater.  It plays movies that will appeal to your "indie junkie" crowd moreso than Camelview 5, which plays more mainstream, readily accessible indie fare (I still love Camelview 5, though).

Valley Art has really gone downhill since I wrote my last review.  It used to be, they'd show movies of all kinds.  Not just the exclusive, you-must-love-art-house-shit-in-order-to-enjoy-this-movie type stuff they've been showing most frequently.  I remember looking at showtimes and seeing classics and well-regarded popcorn flicks:  The Apartment, Network, Fargo, Aliens... those movies kick ass.  It seems that whenever I look to see what's playing it's either a drama about a woman who knits a pair of socks for an hour and a half or a critically-acclaimed movie that's about to be on DVD in like five days.  Seriously.  They were showing the Hurt Locker riiight before its DVD release for, you know, standard prices to see it which to me is rather exorbitant given the economic times we're living in.  I do spend money to see movies because I enjoy the theater-going experience, but if that fucker's gonna be on DVD, like, next Tuesday, I'm going to save a couple bucks and see it at home.  Generally, when you see a movie that close to its video release in the theater it costs around $3.00...  When they premiered movie marathons for Patrick Swayze's and John Hughes' death, that was super cool, but it sucks that it takes the death of someone beloved to play some quality entertainment.  It's been ages since something I've been excited about has played there.  Last thing was probably Che which was quite awhile ago.  Just about a year, I think.  MADCAP theater has picked up where Valley Art left off.  I mean, shit, why can't I have TWO theaters on Mill Ave. that kick ass?  Wouldn't that be sweet?  If Valley Art went back to what they used to do, playing good ol' classic films and the occasional hard-to-find Golden Palm winner at Cannes flick I'd be so happy.  I'd poop in my pants with glee.

This Blockbuster is better than most other Blockbusters and I'm judging it by that alone.  It's not as phenomenal as Video Paradise by any means, but it did have a good deal of what I was looking for during strange movie binges.  I've seen some really decent documentaries, like How to Draw a Bunny, In the Realm of the Unreal and some artsy fartsy favorites of mine like Koyaanisqatsi.    The cashiers are pretty cool.  A couple years ago, I was renting one of the discs to Pee-Wee's Playhouse as well as Sin City and the cashier said, "Whoa, you've got a weird night ahead of you."  I seem to recall that I did.  I have pleasant memories of this place.  I won't go into specifics, but my friends and I did a bunch of drugs and realized, "Oh fuck!  We forgot to get movies!"  We knew we had a good 45 minutes before the drugs kicked in so we hightailed it on out to Blockbuster to get some movies.  It was a race against time to get in, grab some DVDs and get out before we started tripping.    Everything worked out fine.  Things got a little, for lack of a better word, "vivid," but that's about it.  When it comes to Blockbuster, this one's a notch above the rest.  It's got some pretty decent, trashy horror flicks (nothing too Grindhouse-y, nothing like I Spit on your Grave or Cannibal Ferox).  I would recommend this place, though.  You never know what they're going to have and you'd be surprised by some of the flicks that you thought Blockbuster would never allow within their sacred, corporate walls.

Is it just me or did the bus service get WORSE after the drivers went on strike?  It's rare that I ever wait at a stop and have the bus arrive on time.  At a minimum it will be 5 minutes late.

Valley Metro:  When you go on strike, do you know who you're fucking over?  Poor people who have no other way to get to work.  What are you striving for each time you strike?  Your drivers are consistently rude and nasty and your buses are always late.  Whenever a bus arrives on time, it's probably actually the bus that should have been arriving 20 minutes ago.  Since the last time, nothing in the way of service had improved.  Rather, it had gotten worse.  Do you know how many times an Orbit in Tempe has almost run me over when I'm riding my bike?  When my girlfriend called to complain about it, the operator said something like, "Oh, him.  We know all about HIM!" Yet, he was allowed to work there and continue endangering the lives of how many people?  Ridiculous.  Until you can get the buses to run on time and not treat customers like shit (seriously, the way you guys treat riders sometimes is ridiculous; my ass would get fired for that in a damn minute), please don't abandon the people who NEED and REQUIRE your service.  I understand working conditions suck, you have to drive crackheads and everything, but fuck.  You guys are the worst.  You're mean and you've left so many people high and dry again and again and again.

Rollins may not be "clean" or "fresh" or "happy" or "a store," but you know what?  It's MY store and if you don't like it you can amscray!  Rollins has gotten its shit together much more so in the past two years or so since the first time I visited.  It used to be that their produce selection was often-times brown, deflated and covered in fruit flies.  To this day, they don't have a lot of essentials like they never, ever have oranges and their apples are kinda mealy, but, fuck it, they offer most of the things that I need anyway.  If I need to get fruit, Rollins is pretty much the last place on my mind... I'd rather scour alleyways in search of fruit trees sometimes.  But when Rollins has something in its favor, it really works out well.  Their meat selection is generally pretty inexpensive and fucking awesome.  I wanted to get a pork shoulder to throw in the crockpot to make pulled pork and I asked the butcher if he had one in back and he was stoked.  It seemed like no one ever asked him for special cuts, because he hopped to and gave it to me cheap-as-shit.  One time I asked a dude working there if they had tongs for sale.  They didn't, so he gave me his pair that he uses at the deli for free.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a little ghetto and sometimes even a little sad, but goddamnit, this is my neighborhood store and they treat me well.  They're happy to see me and they remember me when I come back.

I love riding the light rail and dining at establishments that don't allow firearms.  Why?  Because I'm liberal scum.  Facetious political banter aside, I think that the light rail is a great addition to Phoenix.  Not everyone is able to take advantage of it due to its limited proximity, but she's still but a pup and will expand in due time over the years.  As it is now, the light rail has really been a major help to me and very convenient.  I've taken it downtown many, many times, have used it to hit up the swap meet (that was awesome), go to a baseball game and dine out at places I ordinarily couldn't make it to as a bike commuter.  I remember when it was brand spanking new, everyone on there was riding it for the sheer spectacle of it.  Now, though, drunken lunatics feel welcome aboard.  They're not all that common, they're not in that majority, but if you ride the light rail enough, you will see your handful of raving, yelling-at-the-moon type maniacs.  For me, it adds character.    I hope to see it branch out in the years that come.

Deseret Industries is unlike any other thrift store that I tend to frequent:  The clothes here actually fit me.  Just last weekend, I bought a pair of jeans and they fit me so well.  I've never really had thrift store pants fit me too well because I'm so short.  I'm only 5'5".  As such, whatever I buy I need to cuff on the bottom.  No matter what, I look like 1 1950's hooligan because everyone's legs are just so much longer than mine.  I bought a sportcoat here about two years ago and it's still the nicest fitting coat I've bought for myself from a thrift store.  Dude, man, you have no idea.  It fits me perfectly.  And it was cheap.  The inside label informed me (to my girlfriend's amusement) that it originated from a now-out-of-business store from California called "The Short Shop: Clothes for the shorter man."  Well, this place isn't for everyone.  But, for some reason, almost everyone who donates clothes here is apparently just a little guy and I thank them for their donation.

This place is so good.  This place.... is so.... it's.... IT'S SO GOOD.  When I was coming in, the metal door shocked the fucking piss out of me, but it's all forgiven because I had a pair of amazing tacos and an equally amazing burrito.  I like the way it's set up so I can see my food being prepared and can see it come along.  It's very much like getting to see a painter actually create the portrait that will adorn your wall.  Dude, with this place and with Tacos Jalisco right next to each other, I'm in hog heaven.  I feel like I'm going to weight a billion pounds by the end of the year.  And if you say anything, I'll bite your face and eat some of it.

This is a wonderful little hole-in-the-wall.  Next door is a laundromat, so it smells soapy fresh when you step outside.  My burritos came fast and they were really, very tasty.  If you're driving by and you're wondering, "Should I eat here?" you should.  For two burritos, I spent a little over 8 bucks.  Not bad at all.

I've kind of stopped ordering other things from the menu after I discovered that their bean and cheese burritos with the reddish-brown salsa are among the very best things that life has to offer.  If I were to commit suicide, I'd lock myself in a room with hundreds of those burritos and a warped record playing somewhere softly.  Everyone would find me days later, dead as shit, with a big smile on my face.

Reading these reviews, it looks like the lady behind the counter treats everyone like shit.  That's kind of good, I guess.  I didn't want to be the only one.  She wasn't TOO rude to me, she was mostly just weird.  I got a watermelon juice and boba.  I was telling my girlfriend that that sounded deeeelicious.  I was like, "Mmmm watermelon juice, yeah!" and the lady behind the counter was like, "It's not a juice.  It's a slush.  Like a slosh."  "That's fine," I said.  On the menu, it's labeled as watermelon juice so when I put in my order, I said it again and, again, she goddamn corrected me.  Look, bitch, if you don't want me to call it JUICE, don't CALL it juice on the menu.  Change it.  Update it.  It's yours!  Or, do you enjoy annoyances and pet peeves so that you can argue semantics?  Then, get this fucking shit:  My total was something like $8.12 and she charged me *$88.12*!!  That's almost NINETY fucking dollars!  She re-charged me, but half-assed it because my bank account balance didn't reflect the correct amount for at least 3 days.  So, for a couple days, I was just fucked, I was out $80 because of this lady.  Sure, the boba was good but holy fuck it's not worth being treated like a tit and having my money taken away from me for three days.

I fuckin' love Bookmans.  I imagine if Bookmans were a person, it would definitely be a lady with an obsession for pop culture and literature.  And she'd be like 90 years old and smoke a lot of weed.  The amount of books and movies that they have is staggering.  I've been here quite a few times and I know I've never walked around and looked at everything that they have to offer.  Each time I'm there, I spend a minimum of an hour.  I look at their movies, their books, their children's section for cheap VHS (got the Lion King for like $2!), video games and all their badassed N64 and SNES titles then I grab a thing of gelato.  It's not just entertainment, either.  My girlfriend bought some cheap champagne flutes here, too, which was kinda rad, considering how clumsy I am and how many glasses I break in a year.  Behind the counter, they have some amazing shit I want.  If I were rich, I wouldn't feel guilty about dropping a couple hundred bucks on a vintage Star Trek model of the original bridge.  After I get my millions of dollars, not one inch will be free from Star Wars and Star Trek memorabilia.

There's a guy who works here who looks like a retired rock star.  I have a theory:  He's not anyone that I recognize, so maybe he was big in Japan and his music will finally get big here in the States in about 20 years and it'll be considered groundbreaking.  By the looks of him, he retired willingly, because he still has a lust for life, but one day he decided, "You know what?  I got all the sex I ever desired, all the drugs I ever wanted to take and enough money so I'm going to retire."  And with that, he entered the Rock Star Relocation Program and took up a job at the Circle K on Indian School Road in Scottsdale.  He brought the rock star passion with him and became the best cashier in the entire known world.  Even though I only pop in once every other month, he remember me, remembers what smokes I buy and charms the shit out of me.  FIVE STARS.

I... I love this place.  I do.  I mean lots of people say they love this place or that place or that they love the way this couch looks in the living room.  No.  I LOVE Taqueria Durango.  Did you ever see that episode of Pee-Wee's Playhouse where he says he loves ice-cream and then someone yells, "Well, why don't you marry it?" and he goes, "Maybe I will!" and the episode ended with a wedding and a sleepover?  It's like that.  So, here it goes:  Taqueria Durango, will you marry me?  I know, it's a foolish thing to ask.  How will we get by?  I don't know, dammit!  What will people say?  I don't care!  Where will we go?  We'll stay right where you are and I'll eat the burritos you pump out.  Is this going to last forever?  Yes; forever.  This place has changed ownership like three times I think since I first started eating there in, oh, 2008 or so.  Each time, the food remains overall the same with some minor changes.  When I first hit it up no one there really spoke a lick of English which never really posed a serious problem because we're making such a minor transaction.  I say, like, pollo asada burrito and they know what that is cause, y'know, it's in Spanish.  After that some angry-looking guy worked behind the counter for only about two months or something, maybe longer I'm not entirely sure.  Now we have this lady working there who's probably the NICEST person in this establishment's history.  And the food is as great as it's always been.  And plus the place has such a warm, welcoming environment for some reason.  I once went there so, so, so stoned.  Like, I couldn't even believe it.  I was like, "How'd I get so high?"  But I ordered my tacos like a fool and no one raised an eyebrow or shook their heads in disgust.  I ordered my food, ate in silence and then got a wild hair up my ass when I got home and baked the worst loaf of bread in the history of me.  Come eat here.  You'll love it.

Now, I don't know much about this menu... I'll admit.  For all I know, their roast beef could taste like a butt.  That's very possible as I haven't ventured far outside of my comfort zone.  Here's the thing:  I'm a creature of habit when it comes to certain places and I have no idea why.  Other places, every time I go there, I get something different.  This is one of those places where I order, more or less, the same goddamn thing I always get:  Their hotdogs.    The guy working there looks pissed when he's not taking your order.  He's got this handlebar mustache and kind of looks up and looks like he could beat the shit out of me.  Once you order, he instantly, WOOSH! becomes really nice.  It's like when he's not taking someone's order or doing something productive, he's angry.  I like his face.  Something about it.  Some people have a face you like or a face you hate.  When I ordered the hotdogs, he asked if I wanted them with everything on it.  I think he said they were Chicago-style but I can't remember.  At this point he knows what I likes.  I took the dogs back to work, opened them up and dug in and MAN... holy shit.  I had never had a hotdog with cucumber before.  It's fucking BRILLIANT, man!  It cools you down and the spicy mustard heats you up.    Oldtown Deli is close to where I work, in a decent location in Scottsdale if you were around there or happen to be driving by.  Check it out and get the hotdogs, dude.  If you like hotdogs, you'll be happy.

After my reservation at the location on Scottsdale Rd. fell through, I came here to get a truck and they eventually ended up being a big help to me.  The dude working behind the counter looked intensely stressed out because I was asking for a 24 hour reservation day of at that location with my initial request being somewhere entirely else.  With it being October 1st, availability was very, very, very low so I can understand why he was so stressed out and annoyed with my request.  Yes, I can understand that, but also, look at it from my perspective:  I booked that fucker a month ago and those other dipshits fell through.  Yes, Uhaul is a soulless corporation with a heart about the size of a raisin but give me a fuckin' break just this once, okay?  And so they did.  They ended up giving me a larger truck for the price of the one I had booked earlier.  Really, I had a rough morning but they pulled through.  If they hadn't, I'd be in all kind of hot water and bullshit right now.

This all around one of my absolute favorite places to go whenever I have the energy to make it out there.  It's not far from where I live, but you have to understand, I'm incredibly lazy.  If I can get away with it, I'll pick up the remote control with my foot so that I don't have to sit up.  If you can, make it for lunch.  Their lunch menu is, I wouldn't say "cheaper," but... you know, it's pretty damn cheap.  Ah, le mot juste!    Their hummus is damn good, I loved the shit out of their lamb's tongue when I had it and they serve good, strong, kick-you-in-the-ass Turkish coffee.  I asked the lady who works there what a great dessert was and she steered me toward this stuff that was like baklava but it had custard in it.  Holy shit, it was incredible.

This theater is THE easiest and closest one to get to from my home.  I hate that I have to ride my bike through Tempe Marketplace, but given how easy it is for me to get from point A (my ass on the couch) to point B (my ass in a theater), I'll take three minutes of stressful bike riding, being concerned about the possibility of getting struck by a car.  I haven't been hit yet, so I have a feeling my luck will continue.  I just hate the way Tempe Marketplace is set up and everyone drives like a cock.  The best part about Harkins in general, even though that dude owns the valley like some kind of 1930's gangster with an "honest businessman" facade, is the loyalty cups.  That shit is such a good idea.  Like a dollar to get a refill on my drink is awesome because going to the movies is pricey, dude.  I can't even imagine if I had kids, holy shit.  The best part about this particular theater is the Cine Capri, they're big momba, bigass screen.  I like that every single time I'm there, they have the people come out and give their spiel, "This is the cine capri, one of the largest screens in all of Arizona, and we have 716 THOUSAND SPEAKERS.  If Johnny Depp coughs weird in this movie, it may trigger a speaker to make your head explode.  Enjoy the movie!"

Johnnie's is fine by me.    I woke up at my friend's apartment and everyone was still asleep.  I was dying of hunger and couldn't wait till everyone woke up.  I stepped out into the quad area and the gate was locked so I had to hop the wall.  Considering how hungover I was, I was proud of myself that I did it with such ease.  I thought I was gonna struggle with it for a bit.  Johnnie's was the closest place I found to eat at.  I was walking for a long time.  I must have just been walking down the wrong damn street because I felt like I was in the goddamned apocalypse.  No one was around and my stomach was punishing me.  When I finally arrived I order mah dog and some lemonade and soaked it all up.  The hotdog came with fries, which I was not aware of until I got everything together.  I was perfectly full.  Not too full where I felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest and I was good to go for a long time afterward.  The price was okay.  The hotdog that I ate was really tasty.  I kind of wish this place was closer to where I live and work because if it did I'd go there for lunch every couple of weeks or something just to hit up the different varieties of hotdogs that they have including various chili dogs and chili dogs with sauerkraut.  That sounds pretty amazing.  Everyone who came in after me proudly declared that they were a regular.  I was kind of in awe of the established fanbase.  I'm a hotdogger.  I am.  If I'm in the neighborhood again, I will eat at Johnnie's.

"White chocolate-flavored beer?"  Those were the last words I said before falling in love.  The thing is, I don't even like white chocolate.  But, as a beer, my tastebuds and my stomach were transported to the closest thing on Earth that could be referred to as Heaven.  I'm exaggerating, but not very much.  It's like saying, "A gajillion!" when the actual number is 753 quadrillion.  Their other beers are great, too.  You can always ask, "Hey, what's new here?" and they'll go through an exhaustive list.  Ask them what their new favorite is and you'll get something amazing.  The food is not only nothing special, I don't even recommend going there with food in mind.  It's not terrible but it's really just not that good.  They have a chicken pesto sandwich that's alright, but generally, I would say, come here after you already ate and stick to beer.  The service is great.  They're always, always as nice as can be without being Ned Flanders about it.  If I ever saw someone being a dick to one of the help, I'd probably lose my shit and go Tony Soprano on 'em.  I saw Barack Obama's acceptance speech here, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Palin and the first half of the Super Bowl.  This is sort of like my second home, only maybe a little bit better because there's more than one toilet.

I don't understand why this place has gotten such a negative reaction from some people.   Beer... and video games.  Sign me up!  In my opinion, this place knocks the socks off of Gameworks.  When I drink beer at Dave and Buster's, I don't have to go upstairs, drink, go downstairs, play, then go upstairs again.  The viscious cycle has been removed.  I can set my beer right next to the arcade.  Gameworks is fun, sure, but I think that little kids are gross.  They have boogers on their fingers.  There aren't any booger-fingery little bastards running around at D & B.    This place can be a little pricey, but it's not overly pricey.  These aren't dive bar prices.  The way I see it, I'm paying a little extra so as to remove myself from the threat of having a baby scream right next to me, right when I'm about to shoot a zombie.  Also, one time, I won enough tickets to get a Star Wars film cell.  Dorky?  You're damn right, it is.  Is that shit hanging up on a shelf at home, right now, as we speak?  You're damn right, it is.

Have you ever been home when your mom's really mad and it's because of something you did like duck out of the house without saying goodbye and disappearing for three days without having called once?  Well you know how when your mom is that mad, she acts just a little bit crazy, like a little bit straight-jacketed, clinically insane?  That's how I felt ordering pizza here and I hadn't even gone on a three-day bender at the age of 17.  The woman behind the counter was nuts.  I don't know.  Maybe something terrible happened to her that day.  I will give her that and assume that the only reason she was acting as weird as she was is because she ran out of hot water and took a cold shower, her car broke down and found out that her favorite TV show was not going to be renewed next season.  My friend was ordering for three of us and we ordered one pizza, a medium or something.  She goes, "That's pretty small for three people."  No, it's not.  We just wanted a few slices each, no need to gorge.  She also looked pissed.  Like... pissed, insulted you would ever order such a small portion.  So my buddy goes, "Fine.  I'll take wings too."  After a bit I mention I'm thirsty, we should get some drinks.  "Bottled water?"  She presumes.    "No,"  My friend says.  "We'll just take iced water on tap."  And she rolled her eyes.  So I go outside and I realize, hey.  Where's my water?  I go back inside and ask for three waters again.  She looks at me and stops what it is she's doing and stammers when she speaks as though I asked her to please help me hoist a car up a skyscraper.  "I--I--ahh-ah-ah... I'm gonna bring it out to you, okay?"  There were only two other people inside, so what the fuck?  I go outside.  Maybe ten minutes pass and no water.  I hit up the market right next door and buy some bottled water because I'm done dealing with Crazy.  She comes out with our waters and is like, "These were waiting for you on the counter."  That's when I knew that, for sure, she was nuts.    Our pizza came.  It was the Monsoon.  I didn't like it.  I like non-traditional pizza.  I've had pizza with fried chicken and gravy and loved it.  This, though?  A swirling typhoon of ranch dressing with peppers and bananas and... you know, man, it could be good.  It really could be.  But when I got it and bit into it, I liked it at first and my enjoyment slowly turned into disgust as it went along.  I'm actually giving another star for the guy who worked there.  He was legitimately nice and when he asked us if we were doing okay, it sounded like he gave a shit.

I'm grading this MVD only compared to other, similar establishments, like compared to other DMV's that I've been to.  As such, it gets 4 stars.  If I were writing this review and comparing this place to, say, Disneyland, it would definitely get like a 1 or a 2.    Most DMV's smell like.... ugh.  Death?  Vomit?  Vomiting corpses?  B.O.?  Cumin?  Hatred?  This one doesn't smell bad and I was here in July in Phoenix, now that's saying something.  If you go to the DMV in California, you'd better not plan on meeting anyone because you WILL need to call them and say, "Goddamnit, this is taking longer than I expected."  Also, California's real dick about licenses.  Arizona is apparently the most lax state in the country about giving people the right to drive.  I went in, gave them my California license, they took my picture and I was in and out in about 12 minutes.  And my license doesn't expire until like 2345, so by then I'll be aboard the USS Enterprise... D.  The Next Generation.    It kind of scares me how easy it is to get a license given how old people love to drive through farmers markets and kill dozens of people.  Oh well.  I got mine!

I avoided this place like the plague because of its name.  I never thought the skit on SNL was funny.  It's just... I pictured some fat, wife beater-clad gentleman giggling about the name "Cheeburger Cheeburger" whilst wiping gravy about his chin.    I don't know why the mental image came into mind, but it grossed me out.  A few nights ago, I dropped into Tempe Marketplace to catch a movie.  I was also extremely hungry.  I bought my ticket and I was going to grab something to eat super quick, wolf it down and maybe die of a meat coma halfway through the flick.  I saw Cheeburger Cheeburger sort of looming out of the corner of my eye.  I sort of cringed because it's the worst name ever, but I wanted to try it out because I haven't had a decent cheeseburger in forever.  I thought it was gonna be a fast food kinda order, get in and leave type of thing but it was a sit down restaurant.  I had like twenty minutes before my movie started.  I was kinda like, "Aw shit.  I'm gonna miss like the first five minutes of the movie probably."  The place was packed so I thought service was gonna be slow.  My food came quick and I made it to the movie like right in the nick of time.  It was awesome.  Service was awesome.  At first, it was a little surreal, because the hostess, like, went on this long, "How to order..." monologue and I zoned out because, man, I know how to order food.  I'm kind of a hick sometimes but I know how to order food.  Shit.  I didn't pay attention to her at all.    Basically, you build your own burger.  Fries aren't included.  Got it.  I built my own burger and it was pretty bomb.  I ordered one of about thirty TRILLION different kind of milkshakes they have.  That milkshake brought me close to orgasm.    The food was great.  The service was super awesome.  Considering how hectic and busy it was, it was great.  There was a mix up and I only got half an order on my milkshake, but I never would have known unless my waitress told me because it was already pretty huge.  She said she'd bring me the other half but I was like, "Nah, this is already bordering gluttony."  If I'm in the neighborhood I'll pop in again.

This really is about as good as it gets.  The coffee is really delicious, the people who work there are personable and make you feel at home, never snooty about anything and the decor is really pleasant.  There's nothing to be said of this place that another yelper hasn't already said more intelligently except for this:  I leaned my bike up against a shelf, my tire slipped and bumped into said shelf, knocking an expensive, free-trade, no-war-orphans-were-maimed-or-blood-spilled to deliver you this glass type thing and it shattered on the ground.   I hate being a clumsy shithead, man.  Anyway, they were cool about it... not just cool about it, they made me feel not-embarrassed.  I paid for the cup I broke and they gave me my coffee for free.    That's service.  Who does that?  If someone came into my coffee shop and broke shit I'd tell 'em to get out.  Also, I like that they don't play the music there too loud.  Sometimes coffee shops have their goddamn hippie shit blaring at full volume.  Here, you can comfortably sip your coffee and nurse a hangover.  The only thing that would make this place better is if they had a kitchen and served amazing breakfast.

This place was terrifying to me.  I did not feel welcome whatsoever.  I came in and it took a pretty damn long time for me to place a drink order and then it took even longer to get the bartender to process my payment so I could get the hell out of there.  The bartender wasn't rude to us at all.  Just indifferent.  I still felt like she hated me, though, and did a good job of masking it.  If a magical being granted her the ability to do something without any negative effects of it while I was at that bar, she would have chosen to put a cigarette out on my face.  The two gentleman sitting at the bar next to me both sounded like Billy Bob Thornton from Slingblade and kept saying the words, "faggot" "cocksucker" and "brown chick."  I was wearing purple shorts and a tanktop and I was with my Mexican girlfriend so it's kind of impossible to think they weren't talking about us.  Who knows, though, they had rotten hillbilly teeth and I couldn't understand much else that they said.  Still, man, my drink was stiff and cheap and I got kind of drunk off of one.  If this place was dead I'd like it much more.  I mostly just am terrified of the clientele.  I liked the booze and I was okay with the bartender who was slow to take my order and may have or may not have wanted to burn my face with a cigarette.

La Bocca is the perfect place for a quiet but fun evening.  It's great to take a date or your parents, a buddy of yours, to celebrate someone's birthday at the tables outside or for a business meeting with a group of colleagues.  One time I went there for a business meeting.  My boss told me to go.  I don't know why.  I showed up and I didn't know anyone there and they were all talking about biotechnology and, while a cool subject, not the field of work I'm in at all.  And everyone there was baby-faced and young.  I knew the guy speaking, but that's about it.  It was happy hour and I got drunk as fuck and ate free pizza.  So, if you were there, I was the guy wearing a tie that nodded approvingly during the lecture and slurped down like three cocktails and three beers.  Altogether, I've probably been to La Bocca either five or six times and I'm always, always pleased with the service and the food.  Even when it's crowded, and I have seen it pretty packed a couple times, someone's going to be there to ask you if you need another drink or more water or anything.  I've tried a lot of their different pizzas.  I've had the badboy with the truffle oil and spinach, the Sicily, whichever one it is that's got like cheese and basil on it.  I'm pretty well-versed in what these guys offer for their standard pizzas and each one is pretty awesome.  Their appetizers kick ass too.  Love the cheese platter.  The Mediterranean platter slaps me in the face with its deliciousness.  For some reason lately, lots of restaurants I've been eating at, I've been ordered their sangria.  As of now, La Bocca ranks up pretty highly.  That fucker was delicious.  Fruity and sweet, but not too sweet.  It was great.  This place is pretty rad.  If you want to class it up without spending too much money (single pizzas are as cheap as $8), this is definitely the place.

I've been here a couple times now and I think it's fantastic.  I had an enchilada burger and I had me some "bacon" the last time I was here, both times to much satisfaction.  Dude, one time my girlfriend ordered "eggs" benedict, and it even had a runny yolk and everything.  The lady who runs this place is a fuckin' magician with vegan food.  So, so delicious.

D'Arcy McGee's reminds me of Casey Moore's lameass cousin who shops at Wal-Mart, invites clients to dinner parties and talks about work every second you're with him.  It's just so corporate.  Everything that could be potentially perceived as being a "pub" or "Irish" or "fun" is whitewashed with wholesome, Tempe Marketplace diarrhea.  My main complaint is that it seems like a bar that my aunt and uncle would love.  They'd think the décor was really cute and they'd then become regulars.  I feel a little bad for the girls that work there.  They wear these plaid miniskirts and these high socks and it's just the ideal image for a pervy, fatass businessman to drool all over.    That being said, this place isn't all bad.  The one advantage it has is that it's pretty damn close to the movie theater.  So, conveniently enough for me, I can slip in, grab a couple beers and a couple cocktails and watch something good and buzzed.  Oh, and one time I smoked a cigarette outside and I saw someone hock a loogie onto a cop car.  I laughed.  Two stars for the loogie and for the convenient location.

SkySong is fantastic if you need to rent a room for a conference.  If you need to hold a meeting or what have ya and have a speaker coming in, you can get a room for sooo cheap here.  Seriously, the room we usually get for where I work is the Innovation Room and it's not much, considering how much it can cost to get a conference room at a hotel.  It's usually around $100 bucks to book the room, then $25 for each hour you have it.  That includes your audio/visual equipment.    I can't remember the room, but one time we were upgraded to something slightly more expensive and it had a projector screen up front and in back so that our speakers didn't have to keep turning around to look at their own presentation.  Because of a super minor inconvenience, we ended up getting the room for free, too.  That was sweet.  I've held two events here and have attended a couple put on by other organizations and it's always awesome.  The food spread they've got going on is awesome.  If you have a job that requires you to hold a get-together with clients, call up SkySong and talk pricing and I pretty much guarantee you'll have a very pleasant experience.

What's not to love about Tempe Public Library?  It's not huge, but they have a book store inside and it's so cheap.  You can grab a hard-cover book that's in PRISTINE shape for, literally, 50 cents.  How fucking awesome is that?  Really, really fucking awesome!  Their selection of movies is always really great.  From this place, I have rented some amazing stuff:  The 7th Seal, The Thin Blue Line, Overlord.  I saw A Taste of Cherry here, which sucked, but I shall not fault the library because the movie SOUNDED really amazing, but it ended up being a long-ass movie about a guy driving around.  Talking.

Granted, I was smashed and had a giggle fit so bad I almost choked to death on my own tears, but I had a blast!  This guy who became my best friend, but whose name I never bothered to get, showed me around and I had an adventure!  I felt like a Goonie.  There's this abandoned elevator shaft with thick glass covering it so you can walk onto this platform and look down into this dizzying corridor like Jimmy Stewart climbing the stairs in Vertigo.  There was this totally abandoned upstairs with a bathroom area covered in mirrors.  Each bathroom or stall area was individual, so if you had to poop, you could totally do it in privacy, which for me is always a big thing because I get poopie stage fright sometimes and I really, really prefer to be alone.  The drinks I bought were cheap and not very expensive at all.  I think it was like $5.25 for a pretty strong gin and tonic.  It was such a fancy place, man, I was glad I just so happened to be wearing a collared shirt and pants without ketchupy finger stains.  After only going to dive bars or just drinking at home or at parties, Hanny's is a really great treat.  I wouldn't go there all the time, but if I had a friend coming in from out of town I would love to show them this place.

I don't know why the people who own or manage frozen yogurt places all decided, "Hey, this place needs to look futuristic!"  Whether you go to Yogurtini or Mojo, these guys made the decision that if you're going to be eating frozen yogurt, you need to be sitting in a place that was designed for a Stanley Kubrick film.    Eh, I like the decor, I suppose.  Must be a bitch to clean because everything's white and all stark.  If you so much as drop a yellow No. 2 pencil, the whole thing is gonna look off-colored.  Yogurtini had it going on when it came to it, though:  Really good flavors of frozen yogurt and the toppings were fucking awesome.  I remember reading years ago how those frosted animal cookies with sprinkles were no more, they were to go out of business.  Two years later I see them as an available topping here.  That kicks ass.

This is seriously such an awesome place.  I didn't know what to expect, really, when I first popped in, but I left with a great haircut and a light buzz from the free beer they give you while you're getting snipped.  I was thinking, "Man, this is.... this is like the manliest place the get your haircut:  Tattoos, haircuts and beer and the option of getting a hot shave."  The only thing missing was I didn't see an issue of Playboy anywhere, but there were some tattoo artwork cartoon boobs on the wall, so that's cool, I guess.

I appreciated that the line moved fast and all, but I did my shit backward, so I bought my coffee then went to go fill it up.  All flavors were gone but decaf.  I thought, fuck it, you know, maybe it's a blessing in disguise.  Maybe decaf won't make me have to take a dump halfway between Dunkin Donuts and work.  Plus, I was running late and could not wait for those mammoth coffee makers to be ready.  Alas, the decaf tasted pretty damn closely to teriyaki sauce.  Yeah.  It was like drinking the drippings of a Chinese food platter.

I go to this CVS pretty often because of how close it is to where I live and because it's got overall pretty decent prices when it comes to beer and champagne and what have ya.  I'm not sure where their prices stand on their hard liquor but usually anything outside of a liquor store is pretty outrageous.  Also, if I have the beer munchies, I can get a frozen pizza.  Hooray!  I have a serious issue with this place in the morning, man.  Sometimes on my way to work, I like to stop here, buy a bottle of water and a Red Bull but sitting out in back, where I like to lock up my bike, are these intensely aggressive tweekers/bums.  If I have money or change, I give it to the homeless when I can.  These guys, though.  I won't do it.  I won't give these guys shit.  One time I was locking up my bike and this chick who looked like she'd been eating meth for breakfast since she was knee-high to a grasshopper whistled at me and stared at me with these cold, dead eyes.  Around the corner, this guy appeared, all gangly and filthy.  Then they start demanding I give them money.... not asking, demanding.  Fuck that noise, Jack.  I took off.  So, this morning I come by and there they are, sittin' there.  I shit you not these guys are about as close to being zombies as you can get.  Not exaggerating:  I rode by and the chick reached out and said, "You got money?"  I circled around to the front entrance, locked up my bike and the front door had a sign that said to go in through the back.  Through the back?  Where those stinky, demanding tweekers can accost me?    If there's a quiet bum sitting out in front, whatever, a little trashy but what's a bum to do?  Two or three tweekers that say, "Gimme money," and whistle at you?  Chase 'em off with a broom!

The cashiers who work for the store itself are very nice and I've never had an issue with them.  The pharmacy workers, however, are horrible.  The service I received picking up my prescription was about as awful an experience as I could have received.  I was treated with open contempt and what seemed to me to be accusatory remarks.  One person who worked there LITERALLY rolled her eyes so hard at me, her field of vision must have vibrated.  It was absurd.  It was childish.  When I actually came to picking up my medication, I was asked what my medical insurance number was "supposed" to be.  The fuck does "supposed" mean?  An odd choice of words.  When I asked for clarification, I received nothing except for a shitty look.  I was then told my prescription card through Cigna was expired.  I didn't even give a goddamn anymore.  I paid the $13 and got the hell out of there.  It was one of the worst experiences ever.  If someone's picking up medication, common sense dictates that you would be a little bit more sensitive to those people.

For ages, the only location for the Cornish  Pasty Co. that I went to was the location in Tempe, which I also gave 5 Stars.  I give 5 Stars to any golden standard that I can always come back to or if it's one of those places that I'll take a friend to who's never been.  Somehow, this location in Mesa is better.  The Tempe location still deserves my full 5 Star-rating, but this one surpasses it.  It deserves maybe a 5 GOLD Stars or something like that.  My friend Chris came in from out of town and had a hotel room in Mesa.  I reserved a Zipcar, picked him up and this where we ate.  Everything was perfect.  I love the outdoor seating, I love the indoor seating, I love the decor and the food doesn't fuck around.  The taste doesn't tip-toe and pussyfoot around while you chew on it, it loads the flavor into a shotgun shells and fires it into you mouth and laughs at you when you're taken back by how delicious everything is.  I love taking friends to places like this because you get to see their over-the-top reaction to it as well.  It's like when you watch one of your favorite movies with a friend who's never seen it and you get to keep saying, "Oh, this is the best part."  With the Cornish Pasty, it's the same thing, so many elements are the best part.  I want to be baked into a pasty and I want to eat my way out of one, but I don't want to drown in gravy or something.

It's a puzzlement to me as to why this place is called Bacon.  When I think of a restaurant called Bacon, I think of bacon all over the walls, bacon for water, bacon ice cubes, cooks and wait staff sweating slabs of bacon and the smell of bacon as thick as concrete...   I'm thinking maybe the name "Bacon," is a joke.  It's not Bacon & Co. or The Bacon Restaurant; it's just called Bacon.  One word.  Five fattening letters.  Bacon.    I stopped in out of morbid curiosity.  I never would have seen the place if not for a guy dressed in a pig suit with a sign that said, "Now Open for Breakfast and Lunch," so I finally got around to stopping in to test the waters.  The first thing I noticed is that the interior is pretty comfortable.  I really liked its design.  There were comfy, squishy couches to sit on and a separate counter with a coffee and tea bar.    I ended up getting a sandwich called The Chick.  I can't remember everything that was in it, but it was really, really good.  It had chicken, some red sauce, some sort of stinky italian cheese (might have been parmesan, but I wouldn't testify to that effect).  It was good.  The fries it came with were good.  Shit, even the cole slaw was good and I think cole slaw is a slimy, nasty mistake to serve as a side.  Yeah, their cole slaw was kind of fruity and tangy.  I really liked it.  The more I think about it, the more I like the fact that this place is called Bacon.  They serve a vegetarian sandwich.  It's sort of like when your friend tells you that their other friend "Chainsaw" is a really cool guy.  You think, His name is Chainsaw?  What the fuck kind of name is that?  But then when you meet Chainsaw, he's a reserved, very intelligent guy who likes the same movies as you.    Bacon.

A funny thing happened to me as I was leaving MADCAP Theaters.  I popped in for the first time and saw a terrible movie called The Room.  I was probably among the few in the theater who hadn't seen the movie before.  I laughed until my cheeks hurt and I thought my eyeballs were going to have ruptured blood cells, for sure.  I was walking down the stairs and I caught a view of Mill Ave. overlooking an amazing view of Tempe.  I saw cars way off in the distance and lonely streetlights lighting patches of the city below.  And that's when it happened... I felt overwhelmed with joy.  This theater is going to be a second home to me.  They highlight crap-tastic movies that I love to watch.  Movies so bad, you want to cringe with embarrassment.  Not everything they play is something I'm interested in; I don't particularly give a damn about 80's comedies about fraternities.  Not my cup of tea.  However, their taste in cheesy horror films couldn't be worse, and that's a good thing in this case.  They showed "The Children" and that's gotta be among the worst things ever printed onto celluloid.  I'm hitting this place up on Thanksgiving after I get my grub on and eat a shit-load of turkey and stuff.  I'm planning in advance:  12 hour long film festival.  Yeah.  That's right.  They're not going to be announcing the titles of ANY movies... just showing them back-to-back.  I may sneak in a flask of whiskey if I'm gonna be there for 12 hours.  This place obviously isn't for all tastes, but if you're a fan of MST3K, you'll dig a theater like this.  I just wish they served beer!

In my earlier review I was like, "Only if they served beer...." sometimes they do, now!  Only during certain screenings, like with Rad and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it's awesome.  This is really, honestly, the coolest theater in Phoenix.    Maybe one day this place will need a roommate and I can stay in one of the theaters.

I liked this place.  It didn't blow my socks off or anything, but it doesn't have to.  It's a burger joint and the burgers are pretty damn good.  For $1, you can add chilli, so fuck yeah, I got myself a chilli burger.  I haven't done that in years and I regret NOTHING.  They have good fries and I had some onion rings to share between me and my girlfriend, too.  They also serve Mexican food which I'm curious to try, but in a much more morbid form of curiosity, the same level of curiosity that allows young men to watch horrible, horrible videos online.  Chances are, if you serve burgers and burritos, either only one will be good or both will be terrible.  I don't think they can do both; historically, I've never experienced this, but I'm not gonna ding 'em on something I've never tried.  Overall, they're attentive, they have damn reasonable prices and their burgers and fuckin' YUM.

I ride my bike to work.  Today I was running a little bit later than I usually do.  I had the slightest of hangovers, so getting out the door was a bit more delayed than is typical.  I was riding my bike down Scottsdale Rd.  I've peaked in the window of Lo-Lo's before and I saw that it was under construction.  Today, I saw people standing around inside.  It was open.  I decided, Fuck it.  I'm never late to work, so today I can be a few minutes behind schedule.  I still made it to work on time, but I set down a Styrofoam box next to my computer with chicken and waffles.  The waffles have a taste of cinnamon to them and they're super buttery and delicious.  The chicken is not the best chicken I've ever had, but the best chicken I've ever had was so good that if I told you how good it was, you would simply assume that I was exaggerating.  The chicken is damn good though.  The recipe that they use is very much complimented by using a splash of Louisiana hot sauce.  It was phenomenally bomb.  I stared out the window, watching the clouds loom in the distance and raindrops spit down the glass... all the while chewing on a chicken bone and feeling my hangover dissolve into genuine comfort.

I spent close to $18 to have my package shipped to me next day from Amazon.com.  If I'd known that I wouldn't get it until MONDAY, I would have gone with a much, much cheaper option.  I only forked over the extra money because I wanted to have my firewire cable over the weekend and begin editing some footage together.  Oh, well, that's not going to happen.  Seriously, stick with UPS or even the U.S. Postal Service.  This is the most expensive delivery option I've ever chosen to have come to me four days after I ordered it.

I'll be damned.  I swore I would never use OnTrac again but I did, albeit on accident.  I chose standard shipping (not gonna do overnight ever again), so I assumed that Amazon.com was going to use UPS like they did for every other piece of my order.  I chose standard 3-5 or whatever for everything and the piece of equipment that ended up being shipped out by OnTrac got to me today, when its estimated delivery was actually for Monday, just like everything else.  So, OnTrac, you did it.  You got something to me three days early.  Now, if only UPS would hurry the fuck up, I'd have everything I need for my camera.

Tempe Farmer's Market is rad.  Their selection has grown immensely since today and when it had first opened.  It's not a one-stop, get all your groceries for the week kind of place, but it works marvelously as a neighborhood market with a few necessities and a great variety of delicious fruits, vegetables, olives, pasta and frozen meat.  Goddamn am I glad this place opened.  Prior to this, my closest convenient neighborhood market was Rollin's Market with its rotting bell peppers and frozen Banquet dinners.  There's always Fry's or Safeway, but I like hitting up a small little market on the corner of my neighborhood and build a rapport with the employees and owners as part of establishing a community.  The dude who runs the place will sometimes thrown in a tomato or apple or lime in with your bag of groceries.  Hey, free apple.    Not everything they have is permanent.  Sometimes something new will be there, and the next week it will be gone, but in a way, I like that about it.  You go in there, and they have these Indian pickles made from wild cucumbers.  Next week, in its place, will be garlic pickles or something else awesome.  For what the place is, it's marvelous.  It's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets.  It's nice having a little market where you can pop in and buy polish sausage from a local farmer, organic soup, goat cheese with kalamata olives but you can also get your regular ass Skippy peanut butter and Campbell's soup.

I had my heart set on Thai food when I hit this place up.  I was running errands with my girlfriend and we stopped at the Asian market to see what we could eat.  This is how I met Thai Spices.  I could go on about this and that and the lovely decor or how quiet it was or how attentive my waiter was.  I honestly don't give a shit.  I could have been eating in waist-deep water with an alligator feet away from me and my review and star rating would remain the exact same.  The BBQ pork that I ordered was the best pork I've ever had in my life.  The salad... eh, looks like it came from a bag and was presented in a darling fashion.  The Thai Tea was awesome (as always)... but, man, that pork.  It was so tender and juicy.  I've memorized its taste and I'm going to recreate it one day.  It may take me a while, but I'm doing it.  If my waiter had told me I was worthless, an accident, slapped me with a newspaper and then spit in my water, I'd STILL give this place four stars.

When you come here, the best thing you can do is order a plate of tacos, more tacos then you can comfortably eat (but you'll eat all of them, damn it) and build a fortress with the salsa cups.  There are so many different kinds of salsa here.  Just keep going back until you have a cup of each different kind and stack them so you create a barrier and no one can see you stuff your face with that delicious food.  Don't be afraid to wipe with your sleeve, because no one will see you.... the wall of cups of salsa will be blocking you.  Eh?  See, I think ahead.

It's a weird thing:  The food here isn't good and since it's a ramen place, you get soooo much of it.  I hate wasting food, so I eat it all, and I'm forcing myself to eat this shit that's super bland and I'm like, "Man.... this sucks."  And it's hot so I'm sweating from that and just shoveling food I don't particularly enjoy into my mouth--not that it's gross, but because someone served it and went, "Shit!  I forgot to add anything to it to make it taste like stuff!  Oh, well.... too late now."

The Duce is fuckin' rad.  They make the best screwdriver.  Screwdrivers are typically boring, but I urge you to get one here.  So bomb.  So goddamn bomb.  I've been here a few times and I've always had a great time.  Great desserts, great drinks.  Some of the reviews say they got shitty service.  Not I.  I've always had great service.  Ordered a shot one time with my girlfriend, there was a bunch left over and got quite a bit of free booze.

I have to admit that I'm really surprised Mister G's has a current rating of something like 4.5.  I've been on a few occasions and had them deliver once and I just don't like their pizza.  It's not good.  I ordered a pizza and wings special that they hung on my door once and I gotta tell you, man:  The pizza tasted like it had been frozen and bought at a store.  The wings tasted good, they TASTED good, but the texture was odd.  It was like eating an approximation of what human food is supposed to be like as imagined by an alien species.  The ambience on the inside when you want to eat in is really just not condusive to a great time.  It looks like it would be better if it were only a bar, but the fact that it's identified with as being a pizzeria makes me like "meh," about the overall effect of their decor.  I remember when this place used to be Roma's or whatever it was before.  It's more or less similar to what it had been previously.  No offense to Mister G. himself.  It seems like he could really kick my ass if he wanted to.

The Clarion is really only a short walk off the strip.  Okay, it's a bit of a walk, but even if you get pretty hammered (and you probably will) getting back to a safe bed is easy enough to do.    Through a Groupon, it only ended up being something like 40 bucks a night with tax.  That's a hell of a deal.  That also factors into my review quite a bit because a lot of their glaring problems were easily overlooked given that I paid such a low rate.  Most nights I understand it's a good deal more expensive and had I paid full price I'd be fucking pissed.  At one point my girlfriend, my sister, my friend and I all got trapped in the elevator with the front desk employee.  He remained calm, so I remained calm, too.  I also had me a tallie of beer so I got good and toasted beforehand so I was pretty relaxed, all in all.  We were in there about 8 minutes, he called for help, the elevator went up, then all the way down and I went swimming.  At the pool, which is open 24 hours a fucking day, by the way, there's a strict "no glass" rule.  So I shrugged and brought glass in, anyway.  A security guard came out and told us there was no glass allowed at the pool.  He brought with him plastic cups for our booze, threw away our glass bottles and told us about the drink specials they had inside.  THAT'S service!  The next morning, check out day, we got a call from the front desk telling us to check the fuck out or they'd charge us for another day.  Now, we thought checkout time was noon.  Generally it's 11 at most hotels, we for some reason thought this one was special.  It wasn't.  They wanted us gone and with the deposit they held on my card, I could not financially afford a one night's ding on there so I told my friends to chill, I'd go talk to the front desk and get this all smoothed over.  Well, I got stuck in the motherfucking elevator again.  I tried running down the stairs, at first, but then realized that I drank and smoked too much the night before.  I heard the elevator so I squeezed in and scared a cleaning lady half to goddamned death.  She screamed.  I screamed.  No ice-cream was involved.  The elevator went UP, then down, one floor at a time, stopping at each floor.  By the time I got down to "Smoothe things over" my girlfriend already talked to the front desk lady and got shit all figured out.  No charge.  No fuss, no muss.  If I could pay the same rate again, I'd definitely be back.

Narcisse is a funny place because it advertises that being narcissistic is a good thing.  The decor has these decorative, novelty mirrors on the walls because Narcissus, blah blah blah.  Thing is, I don't think they're being ironic or making any sort of comment on society being so shallow, I think it's legitimately like a very "greed is good" kind of admission of character.  It's not satire.  It's Scottsdale.  The color scheme is purple.  Purple, purple everywhere.  As such, I felt like I was in that one scene in Batman (1989) where the Joker poisons everyone and Kim Bassinger has to put on that red gas mask.  I've spent a lot of time describing what the place looks like, much more than I typically do, but I feel like it is an important part of the overall experience of coming here.  Look, for $10, you get bottomless "bubbles," which... I thought was adorable that they kept saying "bubbles!" but it turns out that at these kinds of places, everyone thinks they're a champagne expert, which is kind of funny because it's $10, so if they don't say bubbles or something adorable, people will get pissed.  If you wanted to have classy sparkling wine, $10 would be the smartest use of money since Steve Jobs invested in Pixar.  There's no need to complain unless you think that your snob muscle is getting flabby.    Everything else is reasonably priced, too.  My breakfast burrito was pretty damn big and cost something like $9.  Don't get me wrong.  It was bland.  It certainly wasn't bad, but it was like a rough approximation of a breakfast burrito and executed without all the love.  I wouldn't recommend coming here unless your mission, really, is to have a group of people get kind of sauced in the morning and have some laughs, plug your gut with some food and probably pass out a couple hours later by a pool.

This place sucks, man.  From the 45 cents they charge you for a debit transaction fee, to the crazies who howl and bark at each other outside, to the woman wearing sandals with bloody scabs on her feet complaining about how she can't get the buy 1 get 1 promo for Monster Energy Drinks on two entire cases of them.  The one cashier who has a beard and looks like Zach Galifianakis after 16 years of meth abuse is a fucking asshole.    This place is just a hotbed of horrid human behavior and the worst kind of depression will strangle you and take you down after coming here to buy anything, whether it be a Choco-Taco or a tall can.  One time I stepped outside and these three meth-people were all listening to another meth-head guy talk and one of the inane ramblings I heard were, "My name?  It means prophet.  It means I'm a prophet."  Prophet of what?  Crazy Town?  waaahwaaaahhhhhh  No, I seriously hate this place because they charge you to use your card and it's no longer the 1990's, the guy with a beard is a dick and overall it's just a terrible place to go in a terrible location in Tempe.  I don't know why the tweakers feel comfortable here and not the Circle K across University, but I'm glad they found one place and stuck to it, because I will go through another light to avoid this place like a squirrel infected with black death.

Make your way out here and get the Oaxacan hot dog with some beans and rice on the side.  I'll be waiting.  Now, say thank you.  You're most welcome.  This place is legit.  I've been here a couple times and I so, so wish that they were based somewhere much closer to my house.  Then again, I'd probably just never leave.  I'd just come here when it opened, stayed till it closed, and then everyone would be mad at me for adopting such antisocial behavior.  Everything on their menu is a winner.

I mean, what's not to like?  Limited release movies, cult classics and beer.  And now they serve tamales?  One of my favorite places around.

The fact that you guys survived the wrath of some of these reviewers means you have the absolute patience of Job.  Just, whatever you do, don't sit next to anyone or ask them if they have any allergies because, wow, how rude... sitting next to someone as though you're an actual human.  You're not!  You're servers, silly!  In all seriousness, Mellow Mushroom has improved since I last came.  It's not my favorite place in the world, but I really do enjoy popping in for some pizza when I'm in the area.

What in the hell is there not to like about this restaurant?  Listen, for $10, $10 measly dollars I could bum up from strangers outside of CVS within an hour, I can get a three course meal during lunch.  Instead of going to the movies, you can redirect that money and come to Technique and get shrimp risotto, halibut and chocolate mousse for dessert.  Or, if you would prefer, you can get a caprese salad with fried mozzarella, a sandwich with handcut fries and housemade mayonaise and a caramel creme dessert.  I might complain about my food taking a bit too long in the kitchen, but "might" is a distinct impossibility and in a world where I would make such a complaint, gravity makes things fall up, cats drink purple and I'm a complete bastard.  It's time consuming, but it's inexpensive and the food that you get is legitimately delicious.

I got wasted, man, and I was well under my allotted budget for alcohol for the evening.  The drinks are made stiff and they're inexpensive so if you're looking to tie one on, this is really the place you should be going to.  Usually, when I'm tying one on at a bar and I find out that a band is going to start playing, that's like a death-sentence for my evening.  The band will play terrible music so loud that any attempt at conversation will be futile and we'll have to lean in and scream in each other's ears.  "WHAT?!" "I SAID I HAVE TO TAKE A SHIT!" "WHAT?!"  While we were here, a band played inside and, sitting outside, we could still hear the radio music piped out through the speakers.  It was perfect.  The band played and I still hung out and shot the shit with my buds.  I went inside for a bit and the band wasn't bad, either.    This place, compared to other dives, is a class ACT.  There were no penises scrawled into the wall ejaculating onto a mangled vagina.  As much as I love my juvenile coital scribbles, it's kind of nice to drink without having a veiny cock penned somewhere within my field of vision.  Aaaand everyone was really nice here.  No one treated me like a dick.  I paid my tab and jumped onto the lightrail which is approximately fifty feet away.

I called this place as my stomach was a-rumblin' and the gentleman who answered the phone informed me, "Yeah, we can't deliver today...."  I asked, "Why not?" and he said, "We just can't."  No sort of explanation that they were understaffed or any such thing.  They just can't.    Fuck you.

I saw a really great show here with my girlfriend and friend.  The venue itself, I think, has too many bizarre rules and they are pretty disorganized.  Going to take a piss, I'd just bought a beer and, hey, I kinda like pissing with a beer.  It's fun!  Above the urinals they have these metal deals that are perfect for setting a drink on, in fact I can't think of a single other application in which they might come in handy.  As I walk in, this security dude goes, "Hey!  You can't bring your beer in there," and I'm like, "Well, I'm gonna set it down right here, then..." when I came out, fuck, my beer was gone and so was the security dude.  Thanks, asshole, this place doesn't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything, anyway...  Later on that night, the bar lost my friend's ATM card, and as she periodically checked the balance, she saw that at least one charge she wasn't present for at $2 went through.  Lovely.  The venue itself is fine, in terms of set up.  It could stand to be bigger, because this fucker gets packed to the gills, and apparently it gets ten times more packed than it was when I saw it.

Maybe it's the beer talking, Nachobot, but you got a butt that won't quit.  You've got these big, chewy nachos...sfdakljagl;kfgjal;gkja;gll;asdfk...  Seven dollars?!  Get outta here...

The three star rating here, I have to say, is a goddamn shame.  Barrio Queen is a classy joint with good food, nice service and a great location.  When I went, it was newly opened and it took awhile to get our food, but our waitress was never anything but incredibly nice.  I ordered the huitlacoche quesadilla and it was delicious.  I also had an al pastor taco on the side.    Straight up, you're in Old Town Scottsdale and you just got done looking at really lame art made by some old lady and she's telling you that it's authentic Mexican American or whatever the fuck.  Uh-oh, is your tummy rumbling?  I think so, bud.  Tell that old lady to shut her trap and come here.  You'll thank me.  Not in person, probably, but you'll go, "Fuckin'-A, Billy was right.  The al pastor is good enough to murder for."

Waited ten fucking minutes and no one acknowledged us.  And they were out of everything bagels, which is weird, considering their goddamned name.  How the fuck can a place called Everything Bagels be out of everything bagels?

This place is pretty great.  I was thinking about Hummus Express earlier today because I plan on going tonight and I gleaked.  My mouth began water so much that I sprayed my disgusting spit all over the place like a dilophosaurus.  Dude, try the beet hummus.  It's pink and looks awful and weird but it's amazing.  Their falafel is pretty damn solid.    I just love it, man.  I love the way it's set up.  I want more people to come and to support this awesome place.

Seriously, though.  It's $20 for a basic-ass 12-inch cheese pizza.

Really, all around this is about as good an experience you're ever going to have getting your hair cut.  The dudes working there were really nice, worked quick, my hair came out looking awesome and they offered me a drink within only minutes of my arrival.  This place is in a great, central location to downtown and I recommend them as highly as I possibly can.  If you're in the area, walk on down and I'm sure you'll be happy with the service and the final result.

I don't know if they plan on doing this permanently, but when I went the games were free.  And the beer is finely priced.  They have a lot of classic games here and... fuck all, it's awesome.  My girlfriend and I had a great time.  Best of all?  21 and over.  No goddamned kids gunking shit up with dirty hands.  I can drink a beer and play games in PEACE.

What happened to Camelview is a goddamned heartbreak.  Camelview used to be the theater in town you could trust and you would know it would have all of the limited release movies you want to see.  But, now?  At its given price per ticket ($14 for a matinee on Saturday), I just can't afford to go anymore.  It's just a bummer.  I mean, there are places else to see these movies, but Camelview is the first place they go.  Everything else ends up getting them a week or two later.
