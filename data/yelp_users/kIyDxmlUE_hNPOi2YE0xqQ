Seemed better more for lunch than dinner (I've done both), however, really good food (not the standard from what one would usually expect at Chinese Food places in Phoenix) & excellent pricing considering the sheer AMOUNT of food they pile on your plate!   Fed me for 2 days! Good place to bring your family, quiet date environment, & for a massive meal w/o breaking the bank.   I have enjoyed the egg drop soup, orange chicken, beef & brocolli, crab puffs (w/ the hot mustard is delish!), etc...   Seriously, they have the best food & wonderful  service of any Chinese restaurant I've had in the Valley! AND they deliver!!!

I've always come here during lunch & can't seem to deviate from the al-la-carte beef taco & sharing an extra crispy quesadilla... what can I say? I like it *that* much* My friends have had more the variety, we all greatly like the food. Chips & salsa are pretty yummers!

I was taken aback by how involved and caring everyone was when I brought in my little fur-baby Gus... From the Front Desk, to the Vet Tech, to the Vet... Every question of mine was answered. No one made me feel weird for being so involved and having so many concerns. No question was too small. They took time with me, they took time with Gus. They explained WHY we were getting tests done. My normally very skiddish pup was pretty relaxed during his examination. (Which, if you're like me, when you're pet feels comfortable, you take it as a very good sign.) I've had some other less-than-good experiences very recently at other places and was nervous myself to try another Vet, but I have to say with absolute conviction, as long as I live in AZ, I won't take my pets anywhere else. My vote is with Palm Glen (and Dr. Mangone specifically) all the way!! And they're affordable, which pets can be expensive, but Palm Glen is pretty reasonable. Thank you so much :)

I love this Starbucks! It's as close to a neighborhood coffee place this part of Phoenix has. The staff there are always super friendly & chit-chatty w/ me (which I adore) & never had an issue w/ my orders. I tend to order different things a lot, & so far so good. The Vanilla Scones are yummy, I must say.

I love this place! I've been here for lunch, dinner & Happy-Hour... I've had soups, shrimp-n-chips, pasta dishes, steak... (practically the whole menu) & I've always been pleased w/ my food. I'm partial to their fries as well. Great Margaritas (try the Coyote & the Pomegranate) The shakes & floats are pretty yummy as well.  One of the main reasons I like come is *because* of the staff... They've always been friendly & funny & quite entertaining. I'm a patron that likes to interact w/ who-ever is serving me.   Seating is plentiful inside & out. The bar seating itself is a little small-ish. Friendly diner-feel inside.   Steve's comes highly recommended from me ;)

This place kinda sux! My boyfriend & I only went because of an event taking place there...  The servers & hostesses to me seemed kinda rude, our waiter was ok, maybe because he was a dude? We ordered the chicken fried steak, which was way salty (maybe because the gravy?), the gravy was so-so, the mashed potatoes were kinda dry, the corn was overcooked, the cornbread was good. The women's restroom wasn't too clean either. (I don't mean the usual mes from having a busy night - I mean like eek-level) We both got upset stomachs after eating here too  & I don't have a sensitive stomach at all. Actually landed me indisposed in the bathroom for a day. The only thing on par was the beer, which was Bud Light in the bottle. I could see how this would be a fun place if you're going for an event however...

Jobot has become my go-to coffee-fix when ever I'm downtown. The iced toddy is the perfect fix, macchiato was precisely what I remembered a macchiato is supposed to be (thanks San Francisco for ruining me for anything less than excellent coffee)... & OMG the crepes! Try 'em all! Sweet/Savory, they're all delicious & quantifiable sized. Wonderful urban/hipster vibe, even my Mom liked it, good place for a hang out w/ friends, dates even (check out the other local art scenes while you're there), good, chill, laid-back place ;) Not to forget, also, Friday & Saturday, open all night! Now that it's fall, Sunday breakfasts are on, waffles & everything!

I wouldn't normally review a chain restaurant, but this one is literally around the corner from me. In the year or so since they've opened this location, I've always received friendly, speedy, good service & my orders have been spot on!   Great location too, there's a self serve frozen yogurt place down the sidewalk for dessert & other foodie places if your friends all don't agree on one place to eat :)   The bowls & soft tacos are my personal favorites.

This place is just amazing! I first found myself here on a late night seriously craving Pho & a buzz, & my oh my, they do it right! I have since become a regular...   The staff is entertaining & fun, the drinks are awesome, the food is fun & delicious! Great place for a date, to hang out, to have get to-gethers, to come alone & end up w/ good conversation & new friends & a satisfied tummy.   Wide variety of spring rolls & appetizers. The main thing, PHO, is to swoon over. I've had the beef, the chicken & the vegan, all 3 are satisfying. Ask for the Grandma Sauce, but be warned, be sparing in adding this to your Pho.  The Firecracker Shimp is a personal favorite as well.   Safe place for Vegans & meat-heads alike!   I've seen some reviews where others say they feel RP is too expensive & you can get good Pho much cheaper at the other Vietnamese places... true, however, this is "Modern Vietnamese" ... Great food, Great place to hang out for a few hours, Great environment!
