A must for the gluten-free diner who wants variety and quality.  You don't have to be vegan to love the place.  The gluten-free menu is very straight-forward, easy to understand and there are plenty of options to choose from.   My fave on appetizers are the Mock Chicken Wings, as they are wonderful and full of flavor.  They have gluten-free buns, so you can actually get to eat a sandwich like a "real person", but the rice bowls are tasty and plentiful.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  You won't leave hungry.  When one has food allergies, no restaurant is totally safe, but this place comes pretty close.

How the mighty have fallen...  I used to look forward to visiting this place - great food, good ambience.  After this last visit, my family and I are not going back.  I don't feel wanted as a customer because of my food allergies.    I have gluten sensitivity and BBQ restaurants tend to be safer than most.  I'm a big fan of ribs.  Give me ribs, mashed potatoes & ice tea - and I'm content.  No special modifications required.    Their gluten free menu looked like a child had done it.  It was very negative and I don't think it was accurate.  The waitress asked us if we wanted cornbread moments after she had brought us the gluten free menus, and brought us doughnuts at the end of our meal.  I've been there in the past and received excellent service, to the point where I was thinking of scheduling a banquet there.  The last two times, the service has been so meh,  I'd rather take my money elsewhere.

We've had several PCs and laptops repaired here over the years.  They are extremely honest and prices are reasonable.  During their move, we lost them and went somewhere else...big mistake.  So glad to have found them again.  We hope not to need their services often, but it's good to know there's a reliable place in the neighborhood that we can trust.  Keep up the good work!

Went there for my husband's birthday because he wanted to try tepan.  We'll never go back.  Food was OK but not great, our server's attitude was lackluster/disinterested and the show was..meh.  I'm mostly irritated at management's lack of concern.  A bottle of gluten-free soy bottle costs $3.50 and they couldn't be bothered to have some on hand?  I got served a bowl of plain lettuce because they had no gluten-free salad dressing (with the stuff they had on hand, they could have easily whipped up a quick substitute.)    Next time, we will go to Y.C's Mongolian Grill.  Better value, they are very good about diners with food allergies and they're much friendlier.

Great place (albeit pricey) for people watching, but they suck when it comes to gluten-free options.  They put on their menu that they have gluten-free buns (nice!), but almost everything on their menu is chock full of gluten (even Hollandaise sauce, which is just wrong, IMHO).  Server was attractive but uneducated about gluten-free.  Such a big, beautiful menu, but the gluten-free options were the same sad limited choices as any other restaurant's.  I ordered the Angus burger sans bun with goat cheese (an extra $1.50) in an attempt to spruce it up, but I needed a microscope to see the cheese.  Thankfully the cocktail was good.

I'm picky about sushi and I love this place.  We have been here several times.  It's worth the drive out from Tempe.  Better than most sushi places about accommodating gluten-free diners.  I seem to recall that sometimes they have gluten-free soy on hand and other times they don't...so you'll still want to bring your own, just in case.  Best to avoid during peak dining hours as the dining room gets very loud and crowded.

This is not a fancy schmancy steak joint.  If you want romantic candlelight date night atmosphere, this place ain't it. I've been coming here for a few months and it's become my favorite steakery because they pay attention to detail.  I know this because of their asparagus.  It does not require advanced skills to produce a quality steak if you have a decent piece of meat to start with.  However, it's easy to flub asparagus, which is why I use it as a litmus test.  They passed the asparagus test. However, they failed the bonus round (lobster), but that's OK because no restaurant in AZ has passed the lobster test with me.  The restaurant that could pass muster would be overly pretentious and chock full of gluten, so no thanks, I'd rather be comfy...

We enjoyed this a lot.  It probably helped that we had a small group, everyone was very relaxed and in a great mood.

Went here based on a Yelp review that they were very good at accommodating allergies.   Not the case.  Besides that, my bacon and potato were undercooked, I ate one bite and did not think it prudent to eat any more.  My poached egg was so over cooked that I did not recognize it as an egg at first.  My first thought was why is there a rubber ball on my plate?  I'm from America, the home of disappointing breakfasts, I come in with the lowest of expectations, and this was worse than the cafe at the bus station.

My family jokes that we had a 15 year committed relationship with our previous Indian food restaurant that ended once we found Chutney's.  Sometimes we come for the weekend buffet, which has a huge variety, love the chai and all the chutneys.  Other times we come for dinner.  Usually we get the dosa since I can't eat naan.  The dosa is amazing.   We came down one night when they had live music and wow, the guy turned out to be a top notch jazz musician from Seattle.    Other reviewers have written about the slowness of the service, but I think that people should recognize that Chutney is not a place for speed dining.  This is a place where one comes to relax, enjoy a leisurely meal, soak up the ambiance.  It's a great place for a date, or enjoy a night out with friends.  It's good for conversation.

We arrived to pick up our truck in the middle of a fullblown August monsoon.  Not only was our vehicle left unlocked in a place where it was unattended, but the windows were left completely rolled down, so the interior was soaked.  When my husband mentioned this to the receptionist, she merely said, "OK, I'll tell them".  No apologies, nothing.  What????  They did no diagnosis whatever, they didn't address the Check Engine light that was on.  No customer service whatsoever.    Apparently not Meinekes are the same, because we have had excellent service from the Chandler Meineke on Alma School & Ray.

Great food, good prices!  I'll be back.   I especially loved the Vietnamese coffee drink.

This place can't go out of business soon enough.   Maybe in Mesa, where the restaurant biz is less competitive, they could get away with being so subsubstandard, but in Tempe?  C'mon...  This place needs buckets of bleach.  I should have turned around at the door and walked out after the first whiff, but sometimes, ratholes will surprise you.  Sadly this delivered exactly what it promised.  I ordered a lemongrass chicken dish, thinking that would be safe, but got chunks of something in greasy globby gravy.  The spring rolls were dry and flavorless, there was supposed to be pork in there somewhere, but I never saw any.  My dining companions were unhappy with their meals as well.  Our waitress had all the disposition of Morticia Addams, except without her sunny, outgoing personality or quirky fashion sense.  The blaring TV was the perfect accompaniment to the meal from Hell.  Of course, we all got sick afterwards.

In the past, I usually ranked getting pictures framed on the same level as going to the dentist, I haven't been happy with JoAnn's or Michaels and the rest of those framing places are so expensive, you might as well take out a second mortgage on the house....I don't own Picassos, just some modest prints.  I really like Affordable Framing.  They are friendly, talented and their prices are good.  I'm finally starting to get around to getting pieces framed that have been sitting for years.  The most expensive print we own had been damaged in a flood years ago.  (*shakes fist at Tempe slumlord*)  Affordable Framing was able to cover up the damage for under $200.  Yay!   It's so nice to be able to hang it up again.  It looks great!

Because of B&T, we discovered the joy of cocktails.  We are still as nerdy as ever, but now we come here and map out our drinks, whereas before we used to stay home and map out dungeons in D&D.   It'll cost a few gold coins, and there's no Elven Ale served in this tavern, but coming here is definitely an adventure.  They have a few gluten free items on the menu.  I like the meat and cheese platter, though it's not completely GF.  The staff is friendly, patient and helpful.  The drink menu....it goes on and on...  My favorite is the Mon Cherie, a dazzling mix of chocolate and cherry that manages to be sophisticated and haunting.  The Godfrey is a favorite.  Speaking of haunted, my husband used to work in the building and informs me that the building is reported to have a ghost, though sadly not in the restaurant area itself.  The place has a wonderful old-timely atmosphere, so rare in Phoenix.

This is the place for people (like me) who have high standards for seafood.  I won't go near chain places like Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack, because I am so done with paying good money for bad service, loud environment and food poisoning.  (More than once)     High Tide has everything I like.  Relaxing, calm atmosphere, well-designed layout, servers are reasonable and attentive, no signs of that fake perkiness that passes for customer service these days.  The food...oh, the food.  I had given up on having fresh seafood in the desert, limiting myself to brief forays to the coast.  Now I can indulge myself without having to endure a TSA checkpoint.  The High Tide combo is my favorite, because I can never pick just one thing - crab, oysters, mussels, clams, shrimp - I can have it all!  There are a couple of minor points that keep me from granting the 5 stars.  (I warned you I was picky.)  One - it would be helpful to make the menu a little more allergy friendly.   I have auto-immune issues, eating fresh shellfish helps to get much needed trace minerals into my body, plus oysters and mussels are great for inflammation.  When they are combined with things that do trigger my inflammation like gluten, it cancels out the benefits.  Two, please consider adding a hot towel & lemon service to your menu.  I don't mind paying a few bucks so I don't have to run to the bathroom with crab junk all over my hands.  It's icky to have to do that.  I love the creme brulee, it's fantastic, but I wish there was a gluten-free chocolate dessert option.   I know, insanely picky customer wants the world here.  It's because you're that good....and well, my birthday is coming up.   No singing, no fuss, just a small slice of gluten free chocolate cake would be heavenly.   Keep up the good work!
