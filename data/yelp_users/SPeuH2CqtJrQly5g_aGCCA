This place has amazing Japanese food. It is extremely authentic and run by a Japanese couple. Everything tastes fresh, even the Eel (which is often not fresh tasting in AZ) and they make everything down to the salad dressing in house.  The restaurant itself is somewhat quaint but again, the food is great.   Good lunch specials and they are open m-sat (yelp says they are closed Thursday's but that is not true!)

This place looks a little plain from the outside but the interior is really nice, well decorated and very comfortable!   They have an awesome wine selection and the food is really good! The eggplant appetizer was AWESOME. They have an extensive pizza menu as well as a lot of regular entrees.  If you live in chandler, Mesa or tempe I would recommend giving it a try!

I love this place. It doesn't look like much but they make excellent indian food from scratch. They will do any substitution you need and ask for. If you eat there rather than getting your food to go you will get very generous portions for a decent price. They also have wide selection of indian desserts and snacks, most of which are made fresh daily.  It's family owned, if you are nice to them they will be very nice and helpful to you!

This place has AMAZING food! The only downside is they are a little pricy but really the prices make sense with the quality if the food/ingredients. I will say that I thought their margaritas all were pretty expensive. It would have been nice if there were some cheaper ones as well as the pricier/fancier margs.  Great place!

Lots of good looking dishes and a very kind staff but was very disappointed when I actually got my food. Once I got my food it became painfully obvious that they use canned vegetable in their dishes. I will not be eating here again.

After my first dining experience at Beckett's Table I have absolutely NOTHING I could complain about. The food is amazing. They had dishes that were creative yet homey.  The chef/owner is extremely talented but also very nice and personable. The servers were very kind, helpful/knowledgable, and on task. The food is a little expensive but it's well worth the price. They also have an excellent wine selection!  I can't wait to go back!!

This place is awesome. The food is delicious, affordable and made fresh!  Seriously though, the food is great! They have tender and flavorful meat dishes and vegetarian options as well.  Also; that have a BYOB policy with cheap uncorking fee! Amazing.  The decor is cute and the staff was very kind. I honestly can't wait to go back!

This place is wonderful. They have wonderful and welcoming instructors who are very focused on making sure everyone in their class is practicing properly and correctly. They really seem to care that you have the best practice possible. Each of the rooms that they hold classes in have a glass wall that faces a beautiful pond that is surrounded by lush greenery and adorably happy ducks. The scenery really adds to my practice. I've never had a bad experience here during my consistent months of attendance.

Pretty good beer here, though most of their IPA and hoppy beers are somewhat lacking and leave you with and overall "eh" feeling.  The food is good and definitely better than what you find in most breweries in Phoenix.

The sushi here is delicious! However, DO NOT order the "OMG roll" because it is DISGUSTING. It doesn't say on the menu that is come wrapped in foil and is delivered to you by a waitress wafting it over a plate of fire. The OMG roll tastes what I expect a big gulp of lighter fluid would taste like and, in our experience, was inedible.  All the rest of our food was fantastic, so this place is totally worth eating at! My only other wish for this place is that they had a better/bigger beer/alcohol menu.
