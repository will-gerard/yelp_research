Took more than 2 hours for front tire changes and a patch. Only reason I came here was because I had a coupon. When I got the bill, it was more than what I was quoted on the phone.  When we went over the bill, they had double charged me for some items.  Be very careful when you go here!!!  Will not go back again.

The place was VERY clean.  The people who work there are extremely friendly. I have never had a problem here. I got my eye brows done and pedi. The wait was very short. I would recommend to my friends.

Every time I come here, the service is slow and they screw up my order.  It saddens me but this establishment needs to fix this. Happens multiple times.

My husband loves New Mexican food and this place was amazing.  A friend of ours recommended it as she is a New Mexican Native.  We live in AJ but will travel to go here.  Love that they give you sopapillas.   As a previous reviewer mentioned that it is hard to screw up sopapillas.  This is true, but I am a sopapillas connoisseur and  have gone to places where they do screw it up.  I love this place and am so thankful to have a true NM restaurant here in the valley.

Calabasitas were fresh and cheesy. Service was amazing and friendly. Chile relleno and green chile enchilada were quite tasty. Husband said he is going to find excuses to come to this side of town to eat here!!!

Awesome honest people. Jiffy Lube ruined my air conditioning in the middle of summer. These guys helped me out. Great prices. Thanx Jiffy Lube. You made me find a great new location to get my oil changes at.

I went here to get laser hair removal.  Angela was amazing.  Very knowledgeable.  Explained to me step by step each process and was right on the money regarding pain expectations.  I had my lip, underarms and bikini line done.  I absolutely love this and would recommend her to everyone!!!

The worst customer service. One person behind the counter. They called for help a few times and no one came to help. Waited over 30 minutes and the line was super long. Don't ever go to this walmart.  Chose another one

I read the reviews for this place here on Yelp and took my husband there who is VERY picky when it comes to Mexican food.  He told me that we pass the place all the time and there are no cars.  Sure enough, The lot was empty but the food was amazing.  We both loved it.  And me being vegetarian, they had a section of the menu for me.  I have not had fajitas in SO long and these were to die for.  The mushrooms were cooked to perfection.  Slightly sweet.  And the corn was perfect.  Grilled but still had a slight crunch.  And how can i leave without having Sopapillas.  Again.  Great stuff.  I give it 5 stars and have decided to make it our Sunday treat.  Thanx all for recommending this amazing restaurant.

The cab driver was EARLY.  Loved it.  I love that you can book online.  The cab was super clean and the driver was excellent and friendly.  Definitely going to keep their number on speed dial.

I thought this place was great.  They estimated the time to finish my car exactly.  The job they did was fantastic.  I wish I would have known that they were going to put all my belongings in a plastic bag because when I left, I freaked out because a lot of my things were missing (but later found them in the bag).  I got the $99 special like Mike V. did and it came back to me immaculate.  The greeter and service people were very friendly.  When you pay for the services, you have to go inside to the gas station part to do so.  I figure that they are not truly part of the wash so they don't always know what is going on.  Maybe that is why some others had issues with them.  I had no problems.

Staff is friendly. Quick check in and little wait time. Clean lobby.  Doctors knew what they were doing and took the time to thoroughly check on my daughter.  Did a better job than my primary pediatrician.

The food was the worst service. Took over an hour for our food. Only to find out they gave our food to the table next to us. Half the arcade games were broken or out of service. The children playing were pushing little ones. I didn't see any supervision of half the children there. Will never go again.

Great place to get out of the summer heat!  Socks required. Very similar to Gymboree. Glad it is here because Gymboree closed down. They have a ball pit, bounce house, trampoline, art centers, puzzles and so much more. Highly recommend!
