This particular restaurant is not set up well.  There is a section of 4 soups all clearly labeled, but further down, there is a black kettle of another soup with a tiny little label that you have to pick up and read. In the center of the counter, there is a bread bin, you have to lift the plastic door and hold it open while you retrieve your bread.  I was fascinated to watch other people's techniques for bread retrieval while I was eating.  There are tortilla chips in this bin and then you have to go to one end of the counter for taco meat, then to the other end for cheese, lettuce, sour cream, etc. Poorly planned and smaller selection than Sweet Tomatoes, I would rather pay a few more dollars for a better selection.

Hubby and I love this place, we get the make your own pasta dish and split a large.  They have a whole wheat spaghetti, top it with basil pesto sauce, roasted veggies and chicken, delicious!  It would get 5 stars but our waiter was a little impatient and arrogant.  Second time we've had him and he doesn't seem to like his job.  Service was great, attitude, not so much.  Oh and a free pazookie for checking in with Yelp!

I ordered a Frozen themed cake for my granddaughters birthday. The cake decorator was so flexible because I thought I was going to be able to find my own decorations (which was impossible). The staff did a beautiful job and were so friendly and wonderful.

We are definitely regulars here since we try to eat healthy.  We even subscribe to their coupon deals which you can pull up on your phone.  Every month they feature some different menu items so you never get bored with just the salad line.  There is always a big variety of soups and they are fresh and hot.  We usually stick with the salad and soup but they also offer baked potatoes and focaccia bread with different toppings.  They usually have some flavor of "mousse" that is 40 calories per servings, always delicious.  For the kids, there is also mac and cheese and a soft ice cream bar with all the toppings.  I have 2 complaints:   I wish they would stock more fruit.  Usually, you have grapes and whole apples to choose from.  I would like to see a mini fruit bar with some more choices.  They also need to expand the drink bar and have more than one ice dispenser...it's Arizona, people want cold drinks!  The wait staff is hit or miss, some nights they are very attentive, some nights we have plates piling up.

On my first visit, they could do no wrong, on my second visit, it was ok but after my third appointment, I will not go back.  I scheduled a backfill 2 wks in advance with Jimmy.  I showed up for my appt, one of the girls said that Jimmy went to get something to eat.  I asked if we could start on my pedicure while we wait for Jimmy and they accommodated me.  After 1/2 hour, I asked if Jimmy was coming back.  One of the girls brought me a cell phone and Jimmy was calling from a bar, he apologized (I think) and asked if I could come tomorrow.  I told him I was leaving for CA the next day to get married.  He told me one of the girls would do my backfill instead.  One of the girls started to do my backfill while I am still in the pedi chair, awkward and uncomfortable to say the least.  She was trying to do my nails and 2 other people at the same time.  When all was said and done, they charged me $100 for pedi and backfill, only 7 of my fingers were backfilled, the other 3 just filled, my nails were lumpy and thick and I had been there 2 1/2 hours.  I just couldn't wait to get out of there and I won't be back.  They seem nice, but I think when the owner isn't there, they could care less about customer service.

I was in the neighborhood and stopped in today  with shopping on my mind.  I remember the store being crowded and full of bratty, screaming kids with non existent parents from before, but I still love a bargain.  I must be getting older or wiser or maybe I just don't have the need to buy used crap no matter how cheap the price. I went to look at the shoes and the first pair I see are white (or used to be white) sandals that looked like whoever wore them last had wet dirty feet.  Too gross for me and I left and went to Marshalls. I will never ever come back to this store again, lesson learned.  Most of the stuff you see here today will be at the swap meet tomorrow.

What a great experience. I was able to make a reservation through Yelp while we were driving there.  The decor was beautiful with linen tablecloths and napkins.  There was great soft Italian music playing in the background.  Our table was stocked with our own grated parmesan cheese and olive oil.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  We were really surprised at how fast the food came.  I had the roasted chicken, which was cooked perfectly, with crispy red potatoes, best ever!  My husband and mother in law (who are both Italian) had the eggplant parmesan which they both raved about.  They also have family portions that are very reasonable.  The price was a little bit more than the Olive Garden but it was so worth it.  Especially, when the waiter cleared our dishes and said that since the eggplant parmesan was a classic pasta dish, we would get 2 more to take home.  So, 3 of us ate for $65 and we took home lunch for the next day.  We will be back!

I will start off with the only complaint I have about this store:  they need a location in Peoria or Glendale!  I love both locations but it is so far from my house that I have to plan a trip.  When I am able to get out to the east side, I make sure to visit both loctions.  I liked them on FB and I love that  they post items that they've just received, including a picture, size and price.  They usually post once or twice during the day with adorable clothes, complete with accessories.  I've bought a few pairs of jeans and a couple of tops and am very happy with my purchases.  They also support the community and tie their sales in with fundraisers.  It is a fun, unique store with gently used designer items and locally made accessories.  The employees are always friendly and helpful and really enjoy working there.  The clothes are well displayed and the dressing rooms are nice and clean. One of these nights I am hoping to get there for happy hour, where they serve wine while you shop.

I feel bad because I wrote a quick tip on my first impression.  I'm really glad I stayed because it was worth the wait.  My technician was efficient but also made sure my nails were done well.  My pedicure was just what I asked for.  I already scheduled my next appt.  I think I found my new nail spot.

Faith and her staff are friendly and professional! They explained every product they used and why they were using it. I loved that Faith was excited to do my color and even had some of her own ideas too. My color is beautiful, the cut is exactly what I wanted. I left with a complimentary hand massage, confidence and beautiful hair! What more can you ask for?

We went to this cute little yogurt store for it's grand opening and loved it.  It was so bright and fresh and the yogurt and toppings were wonderful.  Then something happened to this place, we went in a few months ago and promptly walked out after smelling a very strong poop smell.  Other customers were laughing at me because I was telling my husband loudly that I can't eat in a place that smells like poop.  Time has passed and we decided to try again because it is so close to our house.  We walked in, no smell, which was good, but the floor was disgusting, like something smashed some berries on it.  The toppings bar looked like it hadn't been cleaned all day.  We grabbed some yogurt anyway and paid the girl behind the counter with no voice and no personality.  We sat down inside because it was hot outside and then started really looking around.  This place was filthy, there were fingerprints and smears all over the sneeze guard.  The grill under the counter had alot of dust on it like it's been neglected.  They have a cute little white leather couch in the front with fabric pillows that were dirty and we managed to find one table that was clean.  Really, we were the only customers inside and the one employee there just kept disappearing.  Obviously, cleaning wasn't her highest priority.  I am so disappointed to see such a cute store fall into neglect like this.  Where are the owners????   Do they not see that they have a problem here???  I won't be back to find out!

My awesome daughter treated me to a facial by Marcie yesterday. Even though this space is in a busy suite of different salons, the room is soothing and calm. Marcie has a great technique and uses products that feel great and smell even better. I felt calm, but invigorated after the facial and massage! Thanks you for a wonderful experience, I can't wait to come back again!

I was referred by my stepson. My car is 9 years old and needed some TLC. Ryan and Arlo were great about giving me options on parts and let me know what was happening. They also made me feel comfortable about leaving my car for a few days. My baby now runs better than I can ever remember. Finally, a mechanic I can trust!

I've never waxed or sugared before, but I'm so tired of shaving, I figured I would start small with my underarms. I am now totally addicted. I was treated professionally and was given thorough instructions for after care. I loved that I had no burning or redness afterward. I'll definitely be back when I'm in Vegas again

This will be a short review because we walked out before we even ordered. My husband and I were put off the second we walked in by how hot it was in there and a weird smell! There was a rack of t-shirts as you walk in the door and then a couple of cardboard boxes below it. Then, I see the Circle K looking cooler containing water bottles and such. It's such a small place and all the clutter as you walk in makes it even smaller. Then the menus are practically on the ceiling. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and grabbed some menus saying they're easier to read! If you know that, then change it! We went to find a seat to go over the menu and noticed a table in the back cluttered with papers and a computer, that was about it for me, so we left.
