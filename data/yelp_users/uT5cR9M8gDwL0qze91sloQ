I haven't been to this location in awhile and I was appalled at the state it is in! The bathroom looked like a truck stop. The floors and tables were filthy. Even the prep area was an unorganized disaster! I mentioned to the manager about the state of the restroom and he didn't even apologize, he only half-heartedly offered to take a look himself, as if I was pulling his leg or something!

Fantastic menu. Bf and I have tried almost everything they serve at this point!  I'm a vegetarian so I love their veggie options, definitely no run-of-mill stuff. I like the pulled veggie sandwich, yummy Smokey flavor. My kids love the French toast bites and I'm a huge fan of the veggie tacos, competition style. My boyfriend is obsessed with the brulee burger.  Only thing is there aren't a lot of tables and the word is out about how good the place is so it can get packed!

I miss the old location. They tried to make it Indian Chipotle now and the food just isn't the same quality. It's really a shame. My boyfriend and I used to love the old one as a date spot and it's gone forever. :(
