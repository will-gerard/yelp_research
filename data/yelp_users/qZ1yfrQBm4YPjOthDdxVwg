Amazing location! I love the extremely friendly staff they are always looking for ways to help you. The food is SO GOOD! Best American food I've had around this area. An absolute must go if you're in Gilbert.

The food was mediocre, but the sushi rolls don't come with any ginger?   Customer service was complete joke. The waiter acted as if I was a pain in the ass, and I was the only one in the restaurant.   Save your time and money for somewhere else.

AZ Pho and Grill is truly a MUST-GO in the Gilbert area. The pho is absolutely PHOnomenal . The owners (Tom & Thao)  are very kind and do their best to make sure you enjoy your food here. My favorite items on the menu is the P1 Pho Dac Biet, the V6 Vermicelli bowl w/ grilled pork, and the Grilled Pork and Chicken Banh Mi sandwiches.   I have been here more times than I can count, and have always had an awesome time.   TLDR; Just go. You won't regret it.

It is pretty much the exact same as Pacific Buffet but cleaner. The owner is the same as well and I see many of the long term staff that I used to see at Pacific over here at Jogoya.   There are also a couple additions like the chocolate fountain, fresh oysters, and now the ice cream is served by the employees.   Great for a casual lunch with friends. :-)

Food is fresh and tastes great. The servers are all very friendly and attentive. The prices are a bit higher than other Korean restaurants, but I don't mind paying a little bit more for quality.   I would recommend coming in for lunch (a bit less pricey). The lunch bento box is a great deal! For 10.95 you get an 8pc California roll, tempura, teriyaki chicken, miso soup, and salad.   +1 from me.
