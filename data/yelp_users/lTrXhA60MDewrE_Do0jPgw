Very good restaurants inside the airport.  They have a self fill water station near many of the bathrooms which means they are eco friendly.  And very good service over all.

Don't come here unless you feel like getting cut & bleed. Worst service ever. After I told them both my son and I are bleeding. They said don't come back. What they thinking?  Me wanting to bring my son & I back to get cut & donate blood?  NOT!

I am not impressed at all.  But I have no choice cuz I have to fly to Phoenix.  If I had another choice, I would not fly with US Air.    I had to pay to check in my lugguage.  Service is bad.  Nothing is good.  Don't know how they remain in business.

There are only 2 other domestic airlines that's as comparable.  I take the cheap peanuts any day to pick my own seats.

Can't believe there is a health food restaurant in Arizona.  Was very good.  Happy we went.

As close to everything as it gets.  I am happy my family is renting from there.  Close to airport, downtown....  And security is great there too.  Good job.

This is the way food is suppose to be.  Fresh from the farm.  Eggs taste like eggs and not bland, OJ is fresh squeezed, all their food is out of this world, and service is awesome.  Definitely a breath of fresh air.

We went there cuz was recommended on one of the food shows.  Aside from alot of food, I was really not impressed.  Was just so much and flavor got all mixed together.  Very good service.  But will also cause a heart attack if go too often.    And we also got a mango drink.  Was in this hug glass.  But too sweet for my taste bud.

This DSW is the best.  I knew they had 70% off of some shoes.  But 80% off?  What?  And they had name brands too.  We went shopping and saved over $800.  Very happy about this store.

One of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  Fusion.  Quesadilla, enchiladas, margaritas, service all excellent.  Thanks you for doing a great job.
