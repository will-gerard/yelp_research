The rubber floor mats in my FJ are hooked into a c-hook to maintain placement. The brainiac who cleaned my car ripped the mounts out of the floor to remove and clean them. It's pretty obvious how to remove them without DESTROYING the mounts so needless to say I'm not pleased with this service

Stockyards has never failed me. My most recent dining experience was to celebrate my grandparents birthdays. They'd actually been to stockyards a few decades back when they first started dating and were excited to return. Our waitress, Alice, was exceptional. She insured that all of our needs were met. Love the history, service, and of course the food at this place!

I absolutely adored our waitress. She was incredibly kind and catered to our needs even before we had a chance to acknowledge them. Food was brought out in a matter of minutes despite their busy flow of patrons. Can't say that I have anything bad to say about my experience here.

This is what Italian restaurants in the valley should aspire to be. Tutti Santi, You had me at first bite. That perfect bite of al dente spaghetti noodles with a rich sauce. Some restaurants fail to capture this simple concept but not here.   There wasn't a disappointed member at my table. We had a a couple items from the menu; Lasagna, bolognese, vasuviani, the sampler-all were a hit.   The service was sincere and not a single member of the staff failed to greet us and they all ensured a great dining experience.   I can't wait to go back!

I've always been able to get my truck serviced the same day when I've called in last minute. Service is as promised and friendly. Pricing is fair with bonus coupons available on their website. Location is downtown and convenient for locals or commuters. They'll even shuttle you to home or nearby businesses while you wait for your vehicle. Total recommendation!

Usually wait until I've had a few visits to a salon before I review just to insure it's an accurate perception. I've had my hair cut and colored here a few times and I have to say that it's consistently great service. I've even watched other clients make their transformation from entrance and exit and they look great. Brian has been my go-to and he's been fantastic but from the looks of the other clients, you can't go wrong here.

Paradise on a platter!  Decor is well thought out, semi-residential.  But quaint.    Service was terrific.  Our waitress found out that we were first timers and was happy to explain the entrees.  All items are adaptable to your taste/desire.  Mix-match as you wish. A water glass never went empty and you didn't have a chance to consider if you were in need of something because she was already on it or asking.  Portions are Gi-normous!!!  Picky eaters or dietary considerations?  No worries.  There are plenty of vegetarian options, gluten-free options.    Yes.  I am gluttonous.  I had appetizers, entree, and of course dessert. Greek salad, pitas with yogurt and cucumber dip, veg kebob with ados polo, baklava, and persian ice cream.  I would do it all again....everyday if I could

I've been a breakfast zombie here for over a decade. Typically was my hangover remedy- a greasy full breakfast with unlimited piping hot black coffee could revive anything! But recently I was in my old neighborhood bright and early, sans hangover and really wanted to stop in..... This place is just as amazing without an alcohol stupor. My belly loved it. The biscuits-Amazing! The refried beans (which go great on everything)-Fantastic! You can't go wrong with any main dish you choose.

Premium drinks. Whether I'm in need for caffeine boost or a relaxing personalized and seasonal cocktail. Have always been so pleased with their product!  Food and pastry selections never disappoint.  It's not surprising that this place is busting at the seams busy but I can't say that I've ever felt neglected or that their quality of service/product has suffered!

My local fave spot to meet friends.  Indoor and outdoor seating-total bonus for our amazing weather!  Tavern meets pool hall/dive bar on the inside.  The MOST AMAZING jukebox you will ever have the pleasure of meeting.  Show up with your pockets loaded with quarters because you can't get enough.

First impression....Strip mall, hole in the wall.    Door opens-I enter and notice that it has its own unique flare......and then the smell hits and I'm in love.  Once the food is delivered I realize no it's not love, I'm in heaven!!!!  Both locations are awesome.  Cheers to beer list

Authentic Mexi dishes that are well priced and not skimpy on the serving sizes. They had my continued patronage when I saw the self-serve salsa, spicy carrots, radish, lime, and grilled jalape√±o bar.  The location is a bit sketchy but the food was absolutely worth the adventure

The service center was exceptionally accommodating. They promised me specific times and came through right on time. The wait lounge is comfy with lots of amenities to bide your time but of course there's always the courtesy van to take you home or shopping

Worst security ever! Someone pulled fire alarm and naturally theaters exited into street. Not once did staff show their faces to bring patrons back in. Not once did staff or security enter individual theaters to give updates. Eventually, after other patrons notified us that people were still buying tickets and entering the main entrance as if it's business as usual did we re-enter. The movie starts after we sit there for 15 minutes but there's no audio. Still no employees have shown up. We Decide to leave only to find chaos and rude staff,who barely acknowledge the inconvenience, at service desk. They give us a single free pass without explanation, apology, or even a smile. Isn't their security supposed to be beefed up.... ?Do they even train staff to deal with issues...?

Try to catch Emily's class -you will not be disappointed. She's amazing.  Gorgeous downtown studio.  Free Garage parking. Friendly staff. Great monthly deals...  Update to original post just to say that Hamid and Kate are additional instructors that I would highly recommend!   Namaste:)

Is there less than a star rating?  Met a group of 10 people at this restaurant for a friend's birthday.  First impressions were good.  It is a lovely old-world mission style building with a warm glowing Himalayan salt wall to illuminate the dining area.  Sounds amazing.  I was sold at first site.    Service seemed accommodating and eager.  The server kept asking if we wanted shots and we all declined, it was way too early to get the birthday girl that intoxicated before dinner, right?  Food was nicely displayed, minimal portions but filling and tasty.  The server asked if we wanted dessert.  We declined.  It was time to finish our wine and think about our next destination while enjoying each others company.   Suddenly, three to four dessert plates are delivered to our table.  Hhhmm, who ordered this?  It was a big table, I assumed someone wanted to share the full course dining experience.  I didn't think to inquire further.  The server again, asks if we want to do shots.  yea, no dude.  Stop with the shots.  Not interested.  A few minutes later a tray of shots shows up....Weird!  Nobody seemed interested the last few times our server asked.  But here they are so bottoms up  The bills arrives approximately $800.  Tips included.  Wow.  Okay, we split it.  We continue to consume our drinks and talk.  Minutes later, the manager ( I assume since we hadn't been graced with his presence prior to this event)  comes to our table to encourage us to leave as the restaurant is filling and they need the table.  Really?  Are you Eff-ing kidding me.  We just dropped almost a grand and have been served a full course meal and you want us to wrap it up.    Outside we are discussing this last event and our dining experience... come to find out, no one in our party ever ordered the desserts or shots!!!  Holy server manipulating and pocket padding scandal!!!   What did I expect?  Ventured into Scottsdale. The land of taking advantage.

Service is always welcoming.  Lucky to have a neighborhood cafe that serves your coffee with a smile and a "Thank you".  Favorite Drink is The Matador and you absolutely can't skip the whipped cream.  Pastries never an intention when I go in but always draw my eye and I'm sold.  They never disappoint

Food is phenomenal. Horchata is the best in town. Love the cozy atmosphere but on a busy night it can be a little too intimate with strangers squeezing and bumping through to tables. Choose a weeknight late or early dinner to avoid.

Spectacular from first site. Great care went into every aspect of this museum. The landscape, patio, and elements are breath-taking. Your entry fee is Kinda steep but it does include a personalized audio tour via your own headphones which is a great concept considering it is a musical voyage you're beginning. The rooms are divided my region and you can take your time exploring and learning about instruments and their use from their native lands. The best part was the room that allows you to play many of the instruments. We spent hours here and probably could've  stayed longer had we planned better.

Great downtown location that's easy to access. Validated garage parking available for your appointment. Always accommodating and friendly staff. Prompt service so that you can get back to work after a quick lunch time appointment. Have been coming here for years for my 6 month cleanings and I've never had a bad experience.

First impression as you enter is simple yet sophisticated.  Amazing decor.  Very tasty vegetarian options.    My date ordered a dish with some sort of shaved fish on the top that undulated....At first I thought that the lights were flickering but no this food was moving but not alive.  Freaky but in a good way

Asian Fondue...AMAZING!    Decor was simple yet elegant.  Service was exceptionally helpful and attentive.  Simple items and preparation that capture the true essence and flavor of the food.    Perfect "hot (s)pot"  for a non-rushed, enjoyable night of dining and enjoying company.  A keeper.

My first review of this spot was really positive but over the years the service has declined. Hostess staff have become rude and leave an air of pretension. Food quality has been good but nothing too impressive. There was a time when you a had one enthusiastic waiter who catered to your specific dining needs but now there's a handful of staff taking and delivering items which just makes you feel like you're being fed by a series of human conveyor belts. There's better options downtown

Quaint venue with a vast variety of beers on draught or bottled/canned.    Theater is cozy with options for traditional or high top table sitting if you're with a group.   Fantastic indie, classic, and new release movies play here. Never a bad idea to just pop in for a drink to peruse upcoming shows just to insure you don't miss a great flick

Best Dine-in or take-away pho in dwntwn PHX. Vegetarian options are a plenty & I can't say that I've managed to find a bad item on any of my many visits. My take-away has always been expertly packaged and just as tasty of an experience.  This adorably renovated house turned to restaurant is quaint and a good spot for a date or happy hour with friends. Full bar and exotic mixed drinks have never failed to impress my friends that I've introduced to Rice Paper. Patio seating is available too. A big plus is I can bike and securely store my bike right in front.

It's out of my neighborhood and I probably only make it here a few times a year but they remember me right when I enter. Incredibly friendly and accommodating! The house special is a favorite. Boba Thai tea and some spring rolls and I'm in heaven!   The construction on 19th ave can make it a task to get into the plaza but well worth it

I love breakfast and was really anticipating vovomeena.  But was quite disappointed. Service was rude. For example; I asked if there was an alternative to the meat sides..... The gals answers was. "You can not have it.".... Wow. Thanks.    Food was nothing to brag about.  Can't say that I feel the need to return or recommend this spot.

A wonderful salon. Clean, friendly, and modern are the first impression. I met my stylist, Samuel and he was eager to please and insure that I came out looking fantastic in my new summer style. It was a joy talking to him during my transformation and it was easy to see that he's a perfectionist. Overall, absolutely recommend This salon

Spot on service. Wait staff was incredibly friendly and never even let us get to a point of need. My friends and I Arrived too early on a Monday morning but knew it was worth the wait so we returned for our late breakfast.  They recognized us as the early birds and thanked us for our dedicated patronage by providing us with a complimentary elote. Otro is my top go-to meeting spot for friends and family. The newbies that I've introduce to their menu are always complimenting the choice.

Great location in downtown PHX. Easily accessible via rail and plenty of bike parking. Lots of green grass, corn hole setups, and local vendor tents to explore in between feasting your ears and eyes with the bands. Organizers had water filling stations so don't forget to bring your reusable bottle. Beer vendors also sold refillable and discounted pint cups. Overall really impressed with this local gig.

Outdoor Bar seating is most desired in this great downtown location but it fails to get the most optimal service. As in we were barely acknowledged by bartender. Doesn't even matter if the food was ok and if we even wanted drinks because our bartender wasn't really even tending to us. This isn't the first time I've had this experience at the bar but it'll probably be the last.

It's convenient but typically service is poor. They've been out of what I order on more than one occasion. They poured us what should've been a chilled sparkling wine right from a bottle stored on the shelf at room temperature. I've overheard other customers complain to staff about poor service while  at the bar so at least it's not just me.

Great utilization of a space that needed to be reborn. Seating setup is versatile-cozy for a couple or select a giant booth for groups. Drink menu is a bit overwhelming as it's pages of options but loved what we ordered. Service was friendly. Lots of staff on a busy Friday night. However, made us wait at bar for a table and when they sat us we saw that there were plenty of open tables in the seated area-seemed pretentious

Love the concept!  Can't make up your mind but you're oh so hungry and you need a drink but what?  Deco bar greets you when you enter and if you're confused by what you've stumbled into just ask. The staff at the different vendors were excited to share their eats or guide you to one their fellow vendors to ensure that you don't perish. Asian, Latin, vegetarian, burger, pastry, coffee, tea, cava, beer, farm-fresh, local, gluten-free....yes! It's a magic land that will accommodate you. Just wander and you'll find it.  Enjoy the patio or indoor seating-it's whatever you'd like to make of it. If you need to work off some of those calories there's even a cornhole setup for after eats playtime. If you're still not content there's probably something wrong with you.
