Food was delicious! Just bummed this location doesn't offer the student discount like the QC location does...

It was just ok. Nothing fabulous by any means but it was at least an ok place to sleep for the night. Carpets need to be cleaned more often so they aren't so nasty looking. It was a non smoking room but since its such an old hotel you could still smell it some.

Best green chili fry bread!!! I have had several other things off the menu and have never been disappointed!

Came in and had a consult with Dr. Hansen. Super nice, super thorough. Had my surgery last week and came in today for a follow up. Office staff has been great throughout the process as well!

It was out first time here so we all got something different and shared so we could all experience a little bit of everything. I got the snow crab legs and they were fabulous with the trifecta seasoning. My husband got the shrimp it was good but just a pain to eat since all the deveining and peeling had to be done on your own. My brother got the sliders they were not that great, too dry. Our friend got the gumbo it was super delish. Service was good. Food, overall was tasty, I'd go back!
