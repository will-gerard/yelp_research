Marco was a HUGE help! I recently switched to a different carrier from T-Mobile (worst mistake) Marco made the process of switching back to T-Mobile easy. He even gave me a handshake for making the right decision to switch back to T-Mobile from that other carrier. I got my same number back and didn't have to pay nothing for switching back. I plan to stick with T-Mobile because of him and the excellent customer service he gave at the store. The other carrier simply didn't fulfill my needs like they said they would offering superior internet coverage which was false in my area of town (west valley) T-Mobile has great 4G LTE coverage in my area! If you come to this store ask for "MARCO" he was a HUGE help! He really wanted me to come back to T-Mobile and wasn't going to let anything get in the way from me switching back. Marco made it happen! Thank you so much! Major thumps of to Marco was the EXCELLENT customer service I had at this store!

They put way too much on the tacos I made a mess! Veggies to be exact. A  little less please.  I wasn't too impressed with the 4th street tacos-shrimp style. The limes were very dry hardly any lime juice came out
