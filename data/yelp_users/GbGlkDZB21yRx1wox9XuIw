Three of us decided to try Aiello's based on a friends recommendation and we weren't disappointed.  We decided to eat at the bar for happy hour.  They had several beers, wines, and well drinks for half price.  The appetizers were half price as well.  We ordered way too many appetizers.  All of them were good but only a few were stellar.  The stuffed mushrooms and zucchini were awesome. I could eat that alone and be happy.  The mozzarella coroza was incredible as well.  The Zuppa de pesci and the calamari were average.  The calamari were cooked perfect but they lacked seasoning.  The service was very attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back!

We decided to try this place to ease yet another burger craving.  The menu looks really good when you walk in and I felt like a kid when I realized the lighted colored squares on the floor changed according to how you stand on them.  I am entertained way too easily.    We ordered our food and I went with their "The Box" which consists of a 1/2 # steer beef burger with lettuce, tomato and onion.  It comes with your choice of cheese, onion rings or fries, and an endless large drink.  I decided on cheddar and the onion rings.  My friend ordered the same thing.  Upon sitting down I had an unsettling thought.  They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked.  Oh well I thought, it's a burger place and with it being a half pound patty it should come out medium.  The burgers arrived roughly around 10 minutes later and the first thing that struck me was how greasy the onion rings were.  They were glimmering with oil which is never appetizing.  The burger came on what appeared to be a brioche bun and had a decent burger to bun ratio.  There was a pickle on my plate that was thin, limp, and could have been the "other" pickle you see on Vlassic commercials.  So how did it taste?  The onion rings had a good flavor but the amount of oil on them grossed me out and I left quite a few on the plate. The burger left a lot to be desired.  Remember that unsettling thought?  Yeah, they cooked the burger very well done.  It wasn't juicy and it's only good quality was the crispy outside that was created on the flat top.  Their burgers come with no sauce on them at all, for that privilege you can either buy one of their dipping sauces or you can use the condiments that they have for you to serve yourself.  The condiments you can use yourself are odd.  The ketchup bottle is massive.  The mayo is a smaller size though as is the mustard.  Perhaps this is part of the reason the burger seemed really dry.  I ended up having to put mayo, mustard, and ketchup on it to revive some resemblance of a juicy burger.  I never tried the pickle.   All in all I really wanted to like the place but it didn't happen.  Even though it's only about 10 minutes away I most likely will not be back.

Nice and quick.  Overview:  Supposedly really good.  Bon Appetite's top ten best new burger places.  1000 degree coal fired oven.  Wait:  20 minutes on a Friday at 6:30  Bar:  Friendly bartender.  Only three beers on tap, one of which is PBR.  Owners obviously decided their tap beer was to be average and boring.  Waitress:  So so.  I can't think of any other words to describe her.  Not friendly, not rude.  So so.  Food:  We ordered three burgers and one portobello burger.  Two of the three were ordered medium rare and they came out medium and well.  Mine was well.  I pointed it out to the waitress and she told me that it was medium because it was red.  Too bad the light above the table was red glass making the burger look less done than it was.  I moved it right under the light where it was clearly well done and she asked if I would like another one.  Um, yes I would.  "Well that's going to take 20 minutes."  Huh?  You have a freaking 1000 degree oven and I want it done medium rare.  15 - 20 minutes later she brings it out telling me the chef cooked it himself.  Great I thought but alas, it was medium going medium well.  This place needs to throttle back their oven big time or invest in some Thermopens.  The burgers themselves were really tasty and had a good blend of flavors.  We ordered three sides, two sweet potato fritters and scalloped potatoes.  You get 4 flat fritters that are about 1.5" in diameter.  Their tasty but the texture was too smooth and most definitely not worth 5 dollars. The scalloped potatoes were good.   If we go back again we won't get a side but rather order the donuts for desert.    Other:  It was odd that when my burger was sent back a manager did not come to the table.  Most places do that to make sure everyone was happy, not so here.  Another issue was the heat of the restaurant.  Every person in our group was sweating and it definitely took away from the experience.

I absolutely love this place and went to about 6 different barber shops to find it.  I loved V's but found the price just seemed to high for a haircut so the search was on.  My search led me to Downtown Barber Shop which is ran by a barber that came here from Russia.  The first several times there his son, Arthur, gave me the best hair cut I had at a barbershop 3 consecutive times.  Lo and behold, Arthur was opening his own place and I wasn't about ready to start looking for a new barbershop.  5th Generation Barbers is nicer than the Downtown Barber Shop but it doesn't have quite the same eclectic feeling due to the years of things being accumulated.  The thing that really matter though is the hair cut and they do a phenomenal job consistently.

I love this place.  I went there with 5 others (parents, sister, brother in law, and wife) a few weeks ago due to the reviews it had received on Yelp.  Well, the name caught our attention as well.    The food is different than what you will find anywhere else in Phoenix but anyone with a somewhat open mind about food will be impressed.  The standouts were the chicken schnitzel cordon blue, the laxpudding, seared gravlax, and the cabbage rolls.  Be sure to save a little room for the Beaver Supreme for desert.  Yum!  The star of the show though is the family that runs the place.  This isn't a super well oiled corporate food machine but it is like going to some friends family dinner.  The timing of the dishes wasn't perfect but it worked out great since we were all able to try each others dishes.  Everyone one of them make you feel welcome and appreciated which goes a long long way in a valley of restaurants with either non-caring staff or staff with attitudes.    All in all, the food and family are great and they make you immediately feel welcome.  I wish them much success.

We competed at this event this year (Little Miss BBQ) and we thought the location was absolutely incredible.  This is their 4th BBQ event and the only major issue this time was the heat which is out of their control.  Teams had samples the whole time and the area wasn't cramped like it was over at the Waterfront location.

I've been here twice now and the carne asada is on point.  They cook the beef over mesquite lump charcoal while many of the others cook it on a flat top.  That means flavor and the flavor of the beef is outstanding.  The menu is limited but what they do serve is all very good.  The flour tortilla is nice and dense with plenty of lard while the corn tortilla was soft and supple.  They also have a salsa / topping bar with items like shredded cabbage, limes, radishes, pickled onions, avocado salsa, a hot salsa and another salsa I didn't try.    The atmosphere is lacking and there is bar seating inside with about 3 or 4 tables outside.  The service is great and both times I was greated warmly and they seem to appreciate that you are there.    All in all, this is where I will now go for carne asada.  America's is eh, Tacos Atoyac is awesome but I've never been wild about their carne asada and many other places simply can't match the flavor of the meat here and really, isn't that what it's all about?

I do some shopping at a couple of local restaurant supply places in the area and decided to swing into this unassuming, small place on the south side of the road. The exterior signs touting al pastor, birria de chivo and chili rellenos sucked me in.   On my first visit, I went for the staples of a carne asada taco an al pastor taco and a pork chicharon gordita. The carne asada was solid, not the best in town but solid. I really like it when it is grilled over charcoal or wood but kitchen logistics as they are I understand the reason why places don't do it. The seasoning was good and it came with a nice soft corn tortilla. The al pastor was pretty stinking good. Great seasoning, just the right amount of pineapple and the same corn tortilla with a little diced onion and cilantro. My favorite of the day was the pork chicharron gordita. It was really really good and I have a feeling it's going to be one of those things I just crave every couple of weeks.  For my second visit, I decided to give the chili relleno a try and it was nicely fried, the chili wasn't soft and mushy but rather had an al dente bite to it. Plenty of cheese, fried well without being greasy and all around a really good relleno. I also had another al pastor taco and it was better than the first time. The seasoning was a hair away from perfect in my non expert al pastor opinion. It was cold and windy out so hey, let's also try the birria de chivo. It came with house made tortillas (amazing), diced onion, cilantro and lime. It hit the spot and if you are new to goat this will have you craving more.  I talked with the chef a little and he spent a really long time (10+) years working with Matt Carter over at The Mission in Scottsdale. Omar knows what he is doing. He decided to pursue his dream and open his own little spot and he is making small additions as he goes. He showed me his trompo and he is hopefully going to get it in action soon after a couple of logistical issues are figured out.
