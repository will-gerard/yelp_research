AMAZING!  My bf and I went to meet some friends for their happy hour on Sunday. We decided to eat downstairs and got a few stools at the bar. There was $5 dollar hot plates and red/whites per glass.  We ordered beef tenderloins skewers and briskets as well calamari. Calamari came out first and it was pretty good. Had a mixture of big and small pieces. Have had better but was worth what we paid for.  Then came out the skewers in 4 sauces. Wow! I mixed the sauces as if I was Picasso ready to paint with my tenderloin skewer (especially the hollaindaise tasting one it was so delicious) and devoured the beef paint brush almost instantly.  After that we were greeted with the beef briskets - it was little pieces of bread with a piece of beef tenderloin and brie cheese melted on top. To die for is an understatement! We had to order one more hot plate as to how amazing everything was as well as the cheap price. Ordered the tacos and took 1 of each. My bf ate the carne avodo and fish, I had the beef and chicken. The beef had an amazing kick of spices in the mouth and the chicken had this unexplainable tasting sauce that was decadent!  After the 4 hot plates we did not have enough room for a sip of water let alone dessert! We closed out and it was a cheap but absolutely delicious good lunch.

I had purchased a Living Social deal for this place (manicure and pedicure) and made an appointment for my girlfriend and I to get them done together. Made my appointment for 7 pm on Thursday. I had received a call around 6 pm that we could come in early however we were having dinner and unable to get there any sooner than our appointment. Prior to our arrival I called to let them know we were on our way and Thressa informed me to park in the front and come through the side door since she was the only there. I thought it was a bit odd with both of us coming but figured there would be someone else there. We walked in and were greeted by Thressa who showed us the colors. Waiting to see when the next nail technician would come in she starts working on my girlfriends nails. My girlfriend and I decided we would opt for the French manicure and pay the difference however I saw the horrible job she did on my girlfriend (the lines were crooked, none of them were even or looked the same) I changed my mind and asked for solid color. She did not soak our hands, cut off my hang nails and when she filed they were atrocious! I finally took the nail file out of her hand to do some finishing touches. I also had to ask her to cut a few areas around my nails because of the way she filed she completely dried around the surrounding areas. She proceeded to color my nails with the Red Wood (dark deep red) color - she got it all over my hands, surrounding areas of my nails. I had asked her if she was going to remove it and she insisted that I let her do her work. I kept quiet and she proceeded to put my nails under the light - well at this point the polish is on my skin. I made mention to it and she took out some oil, rubbed it on my hands and said to let it set - once it has set it will "magical" come off. They had to pedicure chairs; which I thought my girlfriend and I would use....well guess again - I was wrong!!! She had me turn around and set up my leg on her thigh to remove my polish. I asked her "is it not customary for a pedicure to soak our feet" and she stated that we cannot get our toes wet because then the Shellac nail polish won't stick....I found this to be very odd and called her on it. Everywhere else I can gone has given me a full manicure and pedicure (soaked hands/feet, massaged, cleaned/cut/etc). She said she knows other places do that but this is "how she was taught" and if she did it the other way the polish would come off. She yet again got polish all over my skin not to mention the color I picked from their display was not the color that was painted on my toes. After a color change, she then put lotion my feet and cleaned the bottom of my feet with spray bottle water & towel.  We came in at 7 pm and it was now 9:40 pm, my girlfriend said she would reschedule for pedicure as it was taking too long and late in the evening. I could not believe the service and lack of knowledge they had in regards to this procedure and how we did not get full service or have 2 nail technicians available when 2 customers were scheduled to come in. If you have a Living Social deal and have not yet used - call and ask back for your money!! By far the worse manicure/pedicure experience I have had. Not to mention that I do not believe Thressa has her license. Nice lady but definitely not qualified.

I had never heard of "New Mexican" food but now am a fan! I have been there several times and have yet to be disappointed.  Just about everything I have ordered was amazingly good - your best bet is to order something you normally would not, you can't go wrong. (I have tried the following: filet tacos, chicken quesadilla, tortilla soup and the ruben's chicken fried chicken).  The best and favorite thing I have had was their basket of sopa's - I could eat an order all to myself!   If weather permits, I would definitely ask for a table outside or take a seat in the bar (booth preferably). The other side of the restaurant was a little dark for me.

I have gone to Pizzeria Bianco 3 times and each time I have had a pleasant experience.   I know that a lot have complained about the wait however there is a system (as some have mentioned) to this restaurant. If you will have a party larger then 6 - they will take a reservation. You must make it well in advance and definitely worth it - did this once and waited 15 minutes upon arriving to the restaurant.  The other 2 times I went to Bianco was when I had a craving for the delicious pizza. After placing our name on the list, we would head over to the wine bar next door. Order a bottle of wine, some apps and take a seat at the picnic table outside. Just as we finished our bottle of wine, the hostess found us and we were taken into our table. Perfect way to prepare yourself for what we were about to have.   The downside is that my pizza's crust has come out burnt more than once but everything else was great. It is an experience that everyone should try at least once.

I have gone to that Big Fat Greek in Chandler mall a few times; and the food was good - ambiance was ok but it is totally different from the location in Mesa.  My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night, we had a restaurant.com certificate; figured we would give it a try. The service was exceptional, we ordered the meat lovers platter as well as the trio appetizers ( 2 types of hummus and baba ghonoush). The food was really good - a lot so we definitely had a lot to take home.   At the top of the hour the entire wait staff got together and all danced around the restaurant to a traditional Greek song - we really enjoyed seeing that as well as how engaging the staff was. From the sagi noki (flaming cheese) and the dancing - felt like you were part of the family and really enjoyed the ambiance.  The reason why it is 4 stars; most of the wines on their menu were not available but other than that this would be a perfect place to entertain family, friends or out of town guests.

Love, love, loveeeeeeeeeeeee this place!  My girlfriend made this suggestion for us to meet and have some tea. When I walked it the place was very quint and cozy. We grabbed one of the comfy chairs and greeted by our server. She was really sweet (forgot to catch her name) and was very informative on the all variations of tea, as well as allowing me to smell the different leaves/mixes. I ordered the organic ginger/peach as well as the organic chicken salad. Both items were DELICIOUS. The tea was amazingly good and I opted not to use stevia (sweetener).  Their dessert case looked decadent but stayed away (summer is near! need to look good in the polka dot bikini).   We were running late for our next appointment so when we got our check I asked for a to go cup for my tea - the server brought out a full tea for me to take with me which was a nice treat to have.  Would go back again when I am in town.  It was like being in a wine bar but for tea lovers!!

Wow!!!!  My boyfriend suggested this place and when I asked him the type of food he mentioned something about burgers....after taking a look at their reviews on Yelp figured it would not hurt to check it out.  The service was great; our waitress was extremely friendly and prompt with getting us refills on our chips & salsa - which we needed a lot of because they were amazingly good. The salsa had the perfect amount of seasoning to make it spicy enough to have you going for more without burning your mouth off. The chips were warm out of the oven and I could have ate a basket full!  They offer Sangria (white or red) by the pitcher - sure enough we ordered a red one. It was really good and I was pretty lit after my first drink.  I had the Chimichilada - you get a choice of beef or chicken chimi, I had the beef and you also get a portabella mushroom enchilada. This dish was delicious and will go back for more. You get a lot of food on this plate so you will more than likely have enough for lunch the next day and it was just as divine a day later.  My boyfriend ordered the Blue Adobe Hamburger which was voted onto Phoenix's top 10 - hence why I thought it was a burger joint.  We had a wonderful experience, amazing good and will be frequenting Blue Adobe more often.

I love Sephora and hate to do this however I am finding it difficult to want to rate this any higher when it seems as though this store is always disorganized. This is the closest location to me when I visit Arizona however they seem to never know what is going on or have any of the items other stores carry.  I was in last night for the VIB event and inquired on getting my make up done that weekend for a wedding; as opposed to taking the time to just open up their schedule/appointment book I was instructed to call in Friday. Well I called Friday, Friday morning, Friday afternoon and even left a message. No return call made - so I contacted Sephora's main hotline; the customer service rep was able to get in touch with the stores manager and guess what - no early appointments available. I wish I could have been told sooner as opposed to waiting around and now having to find a last minute solution when if I was told this last night, I could have looked elsewhere.  Just annoying and why they are getting this review.

Love this place!  Went during lunch with my colleagues so could not try off their wine/liquor list but the food and decor did not fail us.  We sat outside and enjoyed a nice spring day in Arizona. Pre-summer so able to enjoy lunch without the heat.  I ordered their mix greens salad with chicken; the greens were fresh and the chicken was seared to perfection. My company both ordered sandwich combos (chicken salad and tuna melt) and both said it was really good.  I will definitely be returning and hopefully check out their happy hour that is 11 am - 6 pm daily - can't beat that!

Stayed here while in town for the Night Nation 5K.  It's conveniently located by restaurants and a mall. Perfect place for our weekend getaway.   The hotel is nice, clean and the staff was very friendly.   We checked in pretty late Friday night and Jaque was a total sweetheart. There was a hiccup on our reservation and it was handled the next morning by the hotel manager Jason. He also sent up a little treat bag of waters, cookies and fruit.  The room was big and really nice. Would definitely stay here again in the future.

Used a Yelp deal for this place and took both of my Yorkie pups.  The staff was incredibly friendly - loved that they took the time to introduce my pups to the other dogs there. Paid special attention to how I wanted their hair cut and have not found another groomer as good as Gilbert Dogs.   I live in San Diego and frequently visit Arizona with my pups. Next time I will wait to get them groomed when I am back in town - well worth it.

Love Naturally Nurturing!! I have been going here since 2009 and enjoy every single one of my visits. I really like that Dr. Jesse listens to everything you have to say - provides insightful as well as useful  feedback. I get most if not all of my vitamins and supplements through them.  Jane has always been a great help whenever I call in and wish they were located closer to where I moved because I would be going a lot more often!!  Well worth every scent - if you care about your healthy and the longevity of your life through a holistic and natural way, this is the place to go.  Please note their new address is up the street from this old location: 2470 S. Val Vista Road, #104 Gilbert, AZ 85295  (located in the Kohls/Sprouts shopping area and share a suite with a chiropactors office)

LOVE this place!!! I went in for a facial and Casey was amazing.  The cutest boutique and she does everything from permanent make up to eyelash extensions. My boyfriend's mother found her after she needed eyelash extensions filled and did not want to drive all the way up to Scottsdale. She met with Casey and come to find out where she originally had her extensions done - did a horrible job and if she continued going her lashes would have fallen out! Casey was able to fix what the lady did wrong and take care of my boyfriend's mother, without charging her an insane price! Her prices are very reasonable and you get a lot more then you pay for.   My skin feels hydrated and soft - I am excited to get more treatments done with Casey whenever I am in town.  It also was very easy to book an appointment with her online at her site.

I have been to Casey over 4-5 times now and the most recent time I had a facial, collagne eye treatment as well as my nose pierced. My skin has never looked better not to mention if you get an hour facial; your hands, feet and neck get massaged!  After debating on getting my nose pierced I finally had it done with Casey. It was super easy and hardly hurt - she had the perfect size gauge (not those large ones which I really did not want) and placed in perfect position.   I have another appointment next Wednesday and looking forward to seeing Casey again!

I'm surprised this place has not gotten more reviews and good ones at that.  Went last night after I received a free coupon admitting 2 adults in. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and did not run into once employee that was disgruntled or not genuinely happy to see you there.  We were a little late for the movie but able to find somewhere to sit as there were 2 options available. You can either try and get an area with the leather/plush chairs that have a movable arm rest (makes it great for date nights out) and there are some areas where it is a row of office like chairs behind the leather chairs'; with an area blocking the office chairs from the leather ones that double as tables for the office chairs.  It was very convenient to have the service button; I pressed it before I had a chance to actually look at the menu when our server arrived. The service was very prompt; was informed of the specials they had (margarita Monday's - $2 dollars off any margarita drink) and our food was pretty good. I had the coconut chicken, strawberry frozen margarita and my date had the angus burger. Everything was very tasty.  We were able to enjoy the movie without worrying to get up for more drinks or snacks; not to mention they have a full bar and dinner menu to order from.  I would definitely be going back regardless if I have free tickets or not.
