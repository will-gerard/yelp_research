DUCK NOODLE SOUP.   I've never had anything like it...the broth was sweet, tangy, and addictive. I've had duck noodle soup at various other Thai restaurants in California but Lotus of Siam makes it incredibly well. Came here at 6pm on a Sunday night with 3 others. We made a reservation, so we were seated promptly. When we left at 8pm, there were about 20 people waiting in line. I would not come here without making a reservation.  While vacationing in Vegas, several people were telling us about Lotus of Siam. Some went so far as to describe this restaurant as the best Thai restaurant in all of America. I'm not sure if I can confirm that statement, but it is pretty darn good Thai food.   We ordered: Panang Curry: (5/5) Pad See Ew: (5/5) Pad Kee Mau: (5/5) Catfish soup: (3/5) I would not get this again Duck noodle soup: )6/5) When can I come back here?!! Can't get enough of this stuff.   Random fact: they have an extensive wine menu and a poppin' bar area.

Grand Lux is Cheesecake Factory 2.0.  They have an extensive menu just like the Cheesecake factory, but I would say that Grand Lux has better options that are tastier and healthier.  The avocado chipotle burger was massive and delicious. I had to eat with with a knife and fork since it didn't fit in my mouth. The waiter was very nice and allowed me to substitute the side of fries with the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was perfectly creamy, not too overwhelming.  They have a late night menu from 12am-6pm which means that they are open 24 hours a day! After a long night of drinking, you can stop by the Grand Lux for some late night munchies!   My friends and I came here twice during our trip to Vegas because the prices are great and the portions are big. Many restaurants on The Strip are overpriced, but the Grand Lux keeps it real!

Take your business elsewhere! Don't go through the pain and suffering I went through. Chase took about 5 years off of my life.   I made the mistake of  using Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would "take care of us" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.  If you love being lied to, then Chase is the way to go for your mortgage! I had a terrible experience getting a mortgage at Chase. I had to call multiple managers at Chase before anything was done. They reimbursed me about $1000 for all the headache and bad information they gave me. $1000 seems like a lot, but they should have given us at least $3,000 back for deceiving us.   If I could go back, I would have gone to a federal credit union for my mortgage.
