This place is TERRIBLE. X-ray tech went home early cuz he felt like it so I had to come back again.  They triple billed a visit after I'd told them they were doing so.  After waiting to see the dr then waiting again in the room he had the nerve to take a non emergency phone call for five minutes right in front of me. On top If that they didn't get anything right with my medical condition   This has to be one of the least professional offices I've ever been too from the exceedingly rude, apparently undertrained, and clearly unintelligent front office to the arrogant (what else would lead someone to assume it was ok to put a patient on hold in real life to catch up with your family member) Doctor who was clearly living out of medical practices from 1975 my multiple visits here couldn't have been worse unless they actively worsened my condition which may just have occurred had I continued my treatment with them .   Additionally after seeing their treatment of my mother who wound up her by coincidence and against my better judgment I have no faith in their medical ability.  Post op she was in the hospital a week with blood clots in her lungs when it seems it could have been a day had they made different decisions.   As for my personal visits here(3-5), I've never experienced a doctors office filled with more rude, incompetent, arrogant, and out of touch staff who were more difficult and unpleasant to deal with.

At present with a 3.5 star review I feel this place is way overrated.  Our apps were burnt, as was the pizza, typical lack of knowledge about wood fire pizza leads to over and undercooked pizzas.  The calzone was a hot pile of salty awful.  The tomato sauce on everything was super acidic and lacked any flavor other than tomato. And it was more expensive than the parlor.  I should also add, our entrees came out at different times, offset by more than five minutes, and our server, even seeing uneaten burnt apps didn't offer an exchange or removal from the bill.  Four at the table, none wanted the burnt app..she asked it we wanted it boxed when it was clearly burnt.  Quality control needs work at this place, we wont be going back. It gets a second star for ambiance, it could have had three maybe if the prices dropped about 35%. Yes that would make it cheap..but it's cheap food with lacking quality.

I'm not sure what these negative reviews speaking of drama, bad environment, etc are all about. I've been going here for 2.5 years for haircuts and the staff are some of the most friendly, down to earth, flat out NICE people one could hope for.   I used to be a Tony and Guy client but grew tired of the pomp, pretense, and arrogance there, along with the price tags for less than stellar mens cut.   In particular Jen is outstanding, patient, kind, sweet, and very very concerned that I left happy..every time.  She listens to my input, consults comprehensively, and ensures that I get exactly what I am looking for...and the results are spot on consistent even when my cut style requests change regularly or I wait far too long to see her.  For those thinking of becoming clients don't let a couple of ridiculous and obviously personal bad reviews put you off.  You will have a great experience with no drama..unless that drama is in your own mind or of your own making.   In fact I write this review simply due to the shock of reading the utter falsehoods of some other reviews.  Give srp a shot, I doubt very highly you will be disappointed and only wish more clients with consistent, outstanding, friendly, and spot on results would take the time to chime in here...they don't deserve any sort of bad rep, they are great.  Finally..anyone who left unhappy simply didn't communicate with their stylist.  When getting recommendations for product their policy is 'here's what I think you should use..if you don't like it return it and we will swap it out' in addition to bang touchups and over ear touchups after a few weeks for men...customer service is great, if you aren't happy..it's probably your fault as they bend over backwards to ensure satisfaction.  As to an unrelaxing environment...wow, it bothered you that they were sorting out a ride? Close your eyes and enjoy the fantastic scalp massage shampoo which is the best I've had...what a minor thing to flame on about.

Very average and generic food. Cheap and fast but honestly qdoba is better and right down the street. I was really looking forward to this place based on some friend's recommendations but at the end of the day it was not superclean cheap Mexican food. They also forgot half of my order for takeout. So I ended up with a couple of rolled tacos despite paying for a platter.

Ordered a chx parm sandwich for lunch.   I should have known when it was dead at noon.   Two bites and in the bin. Sloppy gross red sauce. Old and overlooked chicken. On a burnt hamburger bun (store bought) for just under $7.  What a waste of money on some horrible food.  I should have gone with my gut which said gt pizza, now I'll never know because I'll never return.

Makes the olive garden look five star. Despite their claims they most certainly are not using all fresh ingredients and the food is bland bland bland with a metric ton of garlic. The pizza is awful and overpriced. When I complained they comped me $25( which is nearly twice the price of a pizzeria bianco's pizza!) at which point I gave them another try. The lasagna was so bland, the salad was absolutety Spartan. All the way around avoid this place. You'd enjoy Italian from fuzzolis better.

Excellent pizza and risotto..great chocolate cake..friendly servers, reasonable prices...fresh ingredients, good atmosphere.  This is my favorite pizza place in phx right now.  Their wine is not so great, drinks are faaarrrr too expensive for anything not well.  If you don't plan on drinking much, you'll be very happy with this place, if you plan on having a few, the outcome will be much diff on your wallet and the value is lost.   They'll get a fifth star when they don't charge $18 for a double vodka drink using stoli. (hey it was my birthday!). Have yet to go for lunch..maybe a good intro to the place.

I've been going here since before the move and have no plans to change.. As a male, I often feel Uncomfortable when getting a manicure or pedicure other places but at the stash house not only isn't here friendly service but the intimate environment adds a personal feel as well as Not having to sit around twenty other snotty people staring at me.. And yelling over super loud music. It's relaxing.   The conversation is always good and the service at this price point is amazing.   As for the one star review for not getting A response. Sheesh. Talk about being hard on a place.. You realize you're driving their reputation down form what may have been a small Mix up or even your fault.. Give the place a chance.. I've never had any issue contacting anyone at stash house and I always get communications returned whether by social media email or phone. I have a hard time believing the right number was called and you didn't get a response inn's reasonable time. further more why would you rate a place one star if you've never been. Are you just bored?   If you haven't had A call returned maybe try and work it out before recklessly venting with a one star review online. It's far too easy these days for one entitled customer to mid represent actual customer Opinion.   So maybe take it from a long time customer when I say I am Always made to feel Important even though I probably am not Exactly a cash cow for them as I am male the service in receive is pretty basic but it was excellent enough for me to send my girlfriend there who loves it and she has sent two other friends.   Every time my girlfriend comes home with a manicure or pedicure it looks amazing and one thing I noticed since she changed to Stash House - and in don't know why this is but it is - her manicures and such seem to last a lot longer. I wish i could give you technical reasons but she isn't complaining about chipping nails and such now. I'll. Have her write a review too!   One thing - be reasonable About booking. Once you get in for your first appointment get used to booking the next appointment the same day. They fill up. Quickly because the service and price point are impossible to beat. Not too much of a trade off to plan ahead in my opinion.   Congrats for making it through my long review. Someone who has been here needed to set the record straight from. The unfair diminished star rating. I. Don't write that many reviews but when I find good local small businesses in try to support them. This is a shining example..
