Great food. Takes a few minutes to make since it is fresh.

When this dealership needs something from you, they will blow up your phone all day until you satisfy their needs. Then when it is you who needs something from them they are too busy to answer, taking off early,  simply ignoring your messages and consciously not calling you back for weeks. Do not waste your time with these arrogant salesmen, they are the slimiest around.

I just got off the phone with AZ Firearms & collectibles:       The first person who answered the phone mumbled something inaudible before I finished telling her what I was calling for, and in the middle of my sentence. After that I had to assume I was on hold, because she wasn't responding anymore.        After two minutes of silence and being only a moment from hanging up the phone, a gentleman came on the phone and also mumbled something inaudible. I asked what it was he had said and there was no response.       I hung up the phone and then called back, and the person who answered the phone hung up immediately after picking up.        What a nightmare. Don't waste your time calling them, and if you feel my pain boycott these rude jerks.

I tried Desert Eagle as it is closer, but when I get two growlers filled at a time I prefer the beer to be top notch. The IPA and the Enkel are extremely drinkable, from the atmosphere and my drinking experience I would say the rest of the beers hold their own among the best in their respective class or flavor profile. It was early afternoon on Sunday and the whole place was busy, lots of satisfied looking people.

The dentist working here everyday but Thursday treated me plain rudely. I decided to stop my cleaning and postpone it til after I fixed my tooth since there was pain, and the water splashing was unbearable. He just got up and walked away. I had to spit so I spit in his trash can three feet away then stood up and used his mechanism to lift the seat back into a sitting position so I could sit upright. The office girls are wonderful I just can't let the guy do my dental work.
