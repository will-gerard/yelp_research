Not much to say about the customer service in the service department at this dealership, besides that it is below par. I was never offered water while I waited or even notified of a timeframe of my wait. While checking in all of the guys continued to have side conversations with one another, making me feel as though I, as a customer was not a top priority. Needless to say I was not impressed, and plan to avoid a future return due to this unimpressive experience.

Love 180 & the team! Everyone is always friendly & helpful and I never feel like that are trying to 'pull one over on me'  Also, love that it is locally owned!
