Came here the other night and was greatly disappointed... Reminded me of why I do not come here... So I had a gift card so we thought we would give it a shot. It was 9:30 on a Saturday night and we get there and the door is locked... That should have been a sign... Rang the doorbell and someone let us in. We ordered a blooming onion and it was not like I remember. It was a lot smaller than I remember and it lacked much of the flavor I remembered. So I ordered the ribs and chicken and it came with a few very small ribs, and a very small piece of grilled chicken breast and 1 side. So we got an extra side of fries to split because the one side didn't seem like enough. Anyways the ribs were very small but tasty enough. I have had better at a buffet before... The chicken was plain and tasteless. It was cooked correctly but lacked any type of seasoning. The fries we got as extra side were over done and EXTREMELY salty. I understand they like to season them from the kitchen but please leave the extra salt behind. If I wanted that much salt, I would just poor the salt shaker directly on my tongue.

Amazing as always. Friendly staff and great food! I love the BEAR (aka seventh inning stretch) It may sound strange on paper but with everything together magic happens! Try it! You will not regret it!
