Josh and the guys at Sun Cyclery were so helpful with disassembling and reassembling my bike for me to paint myself! I was happily surprised when I picked my bike up to see that they had taken it upon themselves to add reflectors in the front/back and on the front bike wheel just because they are nice guys (I never asked them to nor did I know that was a thing I needed) super friendly!

Lisa did a fantastic job on my gel manicure! I am also going to be a regular to Le Le Nails because they open a fresh pack of sanitized utensils for each customer. A place I will recommend to all of my friends!

Today was my first time at Teres (a girlfriend of mine loves the place and had given me a gift card)   What I loved: The atmosphere: beautiful location The music playlist The movies they have playing The cleanliness     However what I was disappointed with was the customer service of my nail technician. Being in the customer service industry myself, this was a huge disappointment especially with it being my first time in (I even told my technician it was my first time in) There was no introduction. I felt the need to ask her a few questions about herself but it was a one sided conversation so I stayed quiet the rest of the time (thankfully there was a movie playing that I could watch).  There was no massage either. I really wanted to like this place! I may try it one more time and request someone different only because of my friend loving the place.   I just wanted a personable experience and it fell short.
