All I can say is DELISIOSO!  I had the lunch special of St. Louis Style Ribs, Wilbur Beans, Corn on the Cob, and a Cornbread Muffin.  The ribs were definitely finger licking good as they melted in my mouth.  The beans were savory and the cornbread had a sweetness to top off the perfect lunch/dinner (would that be considered linner?) Anyhow, if you like BBQ and have never ate at Famous Dave's, you do not know what you are missing!

After a few weeks of craving red curry chicken, I got my fix at A Touch of Thai.  It was very quiet and my server was very friendly.  The Thai Tea was yummy too!  I will definitely be using this place for the nights of take out and a movie.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow :-)

I spent 4 hours in Paradise Bakery today working on my business plan and doing research.  Oh yeah, and I ate some dinner there too.  I had the you pick two.  I had half of the Paradise Club and a salad that I was able to create along with a Mango Passion Iced Tea.  It was so great!  I received a chocolate chip cookie on the side also.  About 2.5 hours into working on their free wifi, I tried their Roasted Tomato Soup, which was lovely.  I will definitely come back when it is time for a long afternoon of research along with a bite to eat.

For another day of research, I found myself at The Corner Bakery Cafe.  I indulged in a banana bundt cake and an iced tea.  I was there from 3:30pm - 7:30pm and enjoyed the homely feel.  The tables are made of oak and the seats of leather.  It was very comfortable, and the staff there were friendly.  I will definitely keep The Corner Bakery Cafe in mind on days that I need somewhere quiet to work and enjoy a light meal or fresh baked treat.

I was not impressed with this place. I ordered a 2 taco combo one carne asada and one pollo asado. The taco shells were thick and hard. The meat was bland. I had to put lots of sauce on it to give it some spice. Also, I ordered tortilla chips and a drink. My total was $11.48. I could've gone to a nice sit down restaurant and received something that tasted much better for what I paid. Next time I will drive the extra 3 miles to go to chipotle when I'm craving tacos.

Because I am currently unemployed, I had to share the great find that AMC theaters only charge $5 for matinees!  I went to see Law Abiding Citizen at 11:30am.  There were only two other people in the theater.  It was lovely.  I basically had stadium seating all to myself!  By the way, if you haven't seen Law Abiding Citizen you should do so!  It has a great story line and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the movie.

Diamond Nails takes the business to an outstanding level. I looked up nail salons on yelp while on vacation in Las Vegas for my birthday because I didn't have time to get them done at home by regular technician. I must say, that the reviews did not let me down. The employees at Diamond Nails offer their clients the utmost respect, courtesy, and friendliness. They took their time in helping me find what I wanted. Furthermore, they are excellent at what they do. I received a pedicure and Shellach manicure (gel polish) on July 23 and neither have chipped or peeled and it has been over 2 weeks! I will definitely be returning to Diamond Nails anytime I'm in Vegas and will recommend them to anyone I know or anyone who is looking for a nail salon.

I went here for Cinco de Mayo. The crowd was great, but the attitudes of the managers/door men were awful. I was coming down from doing a promotion at Shout House when some people asked me what places where good to eat at approximately midnight. I told them that Saddle Ranch served food until 2am. One of the managers at Calico Jack's expressed an obscenity about Saddle Ranch and said to come to Calico Jack's. When I tried to re enter Calico Jack's, they would not allow me to come back in because I suggested Saddle Ranch. How Ridiculous! If a company is confident, they do not need to bad mouth the competition.  Calico Jacks needs to be aware that I will yelp, tweet, facebook, myspace the way they treated me and if they continue to treat others that way, they will end up like the establishment that once was in that lease space.  I'll bet on that.

If I could give this place an effin zero I would. This is my second post in 2 and a half years and there hasn't been the slightest of improvements. I was having a blue moon at the outside bar and the bartender tells me I can't have glass on the patio. So I tell her to give me a plastic cup that's at the end of the bar. How ingenious is that ish? Because I have insulted her intelligence,  she calls security. Im so happy to be blessed with common sense. Unlike the aholes at this place. Smh in disgust...

I feel horrible giving two negative reviews in a row, but my experience today at mama gina's warrants it. A friend and I came here prior to going to the football game. We ordered a pizza. After about 30 minutes had passed, I asked our server where the food was and he said that it would be right out. Another 20 minutes went by and he kept avoiding us. I asked another server for the manager. She was very nice and tried to deflect us from speaking with the owner by getting our server. After about another 10 minutes of investigating he discovered that in fact they gave our pizza to another table. He said they already started a new one and our bill would be discounted. We got our pizza, which wasn't even that good. When we got our bill, they took a measley 10% off of the bill. Any self respecting customer oriented business would have comped the pizza. Not only did we wait a ridiculous amount of time to eat a mediocre meal, but we were late for the game because of it. I will never go here again and I will never recommend it to friends or family or foe for that matter. Long story short, of I were Mama Gina, I would be highly disappointed that my name was associated with this establishment.
