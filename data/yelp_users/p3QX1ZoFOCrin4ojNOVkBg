The server was so terrible I can hardly remember the food experience.  She failed to return to give us water, or check on us at all.  Failed to clean our table as we finished appetizers and our main course.  The brownie dessert was a major fail, the brownie was too hard.  My daughter had the apple crisp and the apples were all clumped together.  We'd never go back again.  The pizza was 'meh" for $13.50 each.

We've moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receive.  I almost felt judged by the server because we weren't dressed up.  I mean, we were in jeans and t-shirts, but didn't look like bums.  The food was terrible too.  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find.  They claim their pasta is homemade and "al dente", but really it was just undercooked.  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard, or sticking together.  I doubt we'll ever come back.

They have a good thing going here and they just don't know it or don't care about their customers.  Upon arriving the restaurant was dingy and crowded with people waiting.  I understand most Chinese restaurants are dingy, but some still have great food so I ignored the atmosphere.  We waited for about 10 minutes and were seated.  Once we were seated we saw about 8 open tables, but still a crowd of people waiting by the door.  Obviously, they don't manage seating their patrons very well.  The food was ok, not as good as Chinatown in Chicago.  Their dumplings and siopaio were tasty, but BBQ pork was fatty and dry like jerky.  Their servers were less than friendly and treated us like we were an inconvenience.  I'd go back to try some items on their menu, since some of their items were good.  The only reason I would go back is because it is hard to find authentic Chinese food near Scottsdale.  I will give them another chance also because their owner actually read my review and apologized for my bad experience.

I was seated one hour ago and a chef has not arrived to cook for us yet. The front desk staff has an interesting strategy of telling people the wait is 4 times longer than it actually is so they can go home early. There are tables of dissatisfied people staring at empty drinks , they've probably had refilled 5 times, as they sit famished and bored waiting for their food. I really wish there were more Teppanyaki choices in N. Scottsdale. I'll remember this visit and how I'm fighting back the exhaustion of being in this establishment for 1.5 hrs and am starving to death.

This is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in AZ.  We brought a party of 9 on a Saturday around 6pm, so we were afraid we'd be waiting for hours.  We arrived and were greeted by friendly, organized staff at the front desk.  A manager quickly walked the restaurant and found a section that we could be seated at within 40 minutes.  We expected the wait and waited only about 30 before we were seated.  I had 2 small children and 4 teenage girls...I thought dinner would be mahem.  The waitress was attentive and the food quality was wonderful.  She even came back to make conversation with my daughter and her friends and explained menu items to them.  The value was great too, we fed all 9 people appetizers, dinner and desserts for less than $200.

First of all they had HUGE portions, if you are an averaged size human you should share your meal.  The Seafood appetizer was fresh and I could've have eaten more if I wasn't saving room for my super sized steak.  The bread was fluffy and freshly baked.  I ordered the Chicago Cut Ribeye, which was seasoned perfectly, but a bit over cooked.  We were celebrating my  husbands birthday and they sprinkled confetti on the table and made us personalized menus and gave us a picture with a signed cards.  I may go back again, but I think it was too pricey for the quality of food.  $400 for a party of 3.

The service was friendly and the food came quickly, so I have to be fair and give them praise for that.  Unfortunately we weren't very happy with how our food tasted.  Our Crab Rangoon, and Fried Rice were too salty.  Our Egg Rolls and Won Tons in our soup were bland.  The Thai Tofu dish was too dry, although the green beans and flavor of the sauce was good.  I don't think I'll return again.  I'll drive further down South to Flo's.

First, the cost was ridiculously expensive.  I think I could have gone to Disneyland for less.  The animals lived in sub par conditions.  I was horrified to see their baby hogwarts in a glass room with electric blankets hanging down and the hogwarts nibbling on the electrical cords.  I was saddened to see the white tiger pace as they were in a cage too small and looked so unhappy.  On top of a very high admission fee, they also charged a few dollars for every attraction.  I will never return.

We've been to their other restaurant several times so we thought we'd love this place.  The service was ok, although we did need to hunt down a server on a few occasions to fill our drinks.  The main dish of pork schnitzel was too greasy, I barely touched my plate.  The salsa appetizer was good, especially the indian fry bread. We'll probably give it another try since we are locals, but we liked Cartwright's so much better.

I am from Chicago and have enjoyed awesome Breakfast eats, such as the Original Pancake House, Walker Brothers and Burnt Toast.  Since moving to Scottsdale 2 months ago, I have yet to find a good place to eat breakfast.  My husband and I decided to look for a place in Cave Creek to eat, since we love the atmosphere in this town.  We ate outside and my husband had biscuits and gravy that were 6-10 stars, a little bland.  He had a King Kong omelette that was ok, but it was hot and fresh.  I had the German Pancake, and had to wait 20 minutes (but they warn you ahead of time).  This pancake was absolutely delicious.  The pancake is crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  It is served with fresh lemon, syrup, butter and powered sugar.  I also had the corned beef hash, which was very dry and overly salty.  I wouldn't recommend it.    The service was friendly, but if you sit outside it may take a while for them to greet you.  I'd definitely eat here again.  They also let you bring your dogs if you sit outside!

I'd read so many good reviews so I was expecting much better than I experienced.  We ordered,Fried Mushrooms Zucchini and Onions, BBQ Pork Ribs, Liver & Onions, Fried Chicken, a burger, Strawberry Shortcake and a Brownie Sundae.  The Fried Zucchini and Onions were good, but the mushrooms were cold and some of the batter was raw.  The ribs were dry.  The Liver and Onions was surprisingly tasty, but the mashed potatoes were "fake".  They tasted like they came from a box.  The burger was good, but so is In and Out.  The Strawberry Shortcake was supposedly award winning, but the strawberries were from a can/jar, they were soaked, not fresh and a weird tinge of purple.  The cake alone was delicious and hot.  This dessert should have been served with ice cream.  The Brownie Sundae was the most delicious part of the whole meal.  The brown was hot, and soft and served with ice cream and whipped cream.  The fried chicken was tasty, but not hot enough.  I can't say I will ever go back, other than to have the Brown Sundae again.  The server forgot about us and we went thirsty most of the meal.  This seems like a tourist trap, so no matter how many bad reviews they get, I think they will continue to be busy.

I was a bit apprehensive when making a last minute reservation to Spago, I'd never heard reviews and it wasn't terribly busy.  I was worried it wasn't busy because it wasn't good.  Boy, was I wrong. This was some of the best food and service we've ever received.  We enjoyed the Chef's Selection 6 course meal and it was worth every penny.  I can't wait to come back.  The flavors were fresh, crisp and delicious.  The server was amazing.  He knew we were in a time crunch, but somehow still delivered the meal in a relaxing and enjoyable way.  I was so impressed with each servers knowledge of the cuisine they were serving.

This place needs a face lift.  There is no better way to thank your customers than to make your establishment a pleasant place to be.  Seats were disgusting, and it's at least been a few days since someone swept the floor.

I had eaten here about a year ago, after being out late.  Their Chinese soup was delicious.  We had heard about their 777 special (Steak and Shrimp for $7.77) so we decided to come back for lunch after a UNLV graduation.  The waitress was terrible.  I wish I could remember her name so I could warn other potential patrons.  She took our order, checked on us once and then never returned until we asked the hostess for our waitress.  We were parched the entire meal.  A few of the other entrees we ordered were, an open faced turkey sandwich (good), cheese pizza (gross, no flavor), breakfast plate (my daughter go sick afterwards), and the 777 special was ok.  I don't think I'll ever return.

I'm perplexed by all of the 4+ star reviews for this restaurant.  We were seated on the patio, which was nice.  The food was not impressive at all.  The Pollo Fundido that everyone raves about was dry and there wasn't enough of the jalapeno cream sauce.  I was dissapointed that when my daughter found hair in her food, they still charged us for the meal because they remade her plate.  The problem however, was my daughter had lost her appetite from seeing the hair and couldn't eat her food anyways.    My husband ordered the lamb stew.  The sauce was seasoned well, but the lamb was very dry, just like my plate.  This restaurant was packed, so people must have good experiences here, but as for our family, we won't go back.

We've eaten at Maggiano's in several states around the country and it is usually one of our favorite places.  We arrived close to 8:15pm on a Monday night and their were many tables open, yet the hostess asked us if we had a reservation.  We told her no, so she then "checked her table map" and said it was a 20 minute wait.  It was such a ridiculous situation since there were no patrons waiting and tables were open.  We went to Brio instead and were seated right away!

Maybe my visit was a bit different this time since I made a reservation and didn't have to fight to get in.  We ate their for lunch and all of our entrees were delicious.  We enjoyed the Calamari, Stuffed Mushroom, Maggiano's Salad, Chicken PIcatta, Ravioli del Forno and Spaghetti.  We loved the whole take home portions they offer with their pastas.  The server was fabulous.

I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.

Horrible service upon arrival. 6 open tables and we were told it would be a 30 min wait because the hostesses said they didn't want to overwhelm their servers.  The three hostesses then went on to tell us the restaurant was so very busy and we didn't understand,  even though we were staring at a restaurant with several empty tables.  The hostesses were rude and condescending.  One hostess then went on to say our patronage as year round Arizonans didn't matter. No thank you Outback, we'll never visit again. Oh and we easily spend over $1,000 every year.

The pizza crust was paper thin, and the pizza wasn't seasoned very well.  I thought the pricing was a bit high for the quality of food.  Definitely not a Grimaldi's quality pizza.  I doubt I'll come back.

I've been to many Cheesecake Factories around the country and I was just as happy with my experience here.  We had a large party and were fed relatively quickly.  I do wish the wait staff would have cleaned our table more regularly and given us a bit more time between the appetizer and the mail course.  The pan fried Salmon and pasta was delicious, maybe the best restaurant cooked Salmon I've ever had.

We had crawfish, crab legs and shrimp and all of them were delicious.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because the service was slow after we received our food initially.  Our mouths were burning and we needed fries and drink refills, but we had a hard time tracking down the waitress, and they weren't that busy!!  We'd still return because the food was out of this world.

My husband and I went their for a late night snack and to hang out outside.  We ordered the cheese and fruit platter.  The platter was delicious and we had a wide variety of cheese to choose from.  It was cold outside and the servers were nice enough to go around the whole patio to find the heater that worked so we could sit outside.  I'd definitely eat at this place again.  It had great energy and friendly servers.

Their nigiri salmon is delicious, fresh and has no fishy taste.  I love that they add wasabi under the fish. I have eaten the Sea Bass, that is flaky warm and tasty, some of the best I've had.  I've never eaten anything I didn't love.  Their tempura udon is also awesome.  The servers here are wonderful, and love to make conversation.  The best time to go is Happy Hour, they have great sushi and appetizer deals.  I "heart" Pure Sushi.

This was our first visit and although it was busy we were seating quickly since we chose to eat outside.  The misters and fans made it comfortable.  The server was attentive and quick to return to check on us and take our order.  We enjoyed the sweet tamale appetizer, chicken fundido, steak and lobster tacos.  I can't say the lobster taco were the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was ok. The rice was a little too dry.  We loved our cookie sundaie and fried ice cream dessert.  We'll be back!

I couldn't finish my food because it was cold and tasteless.  I've had meals at IHOP that have been better.  I should have walked out before I ate because the decor was terrible, and that should have been the first sign.  Drinking water out of an old plastic cup was also gross.  I had the eggs benedict and the muffin was not fresh and the sauce was not creamy or hot.  I will never go back.

The food was delicious, tasty and fresh.  The servings are small, and a little pricey, but worth it.  Towards the end we felt like our waitress had forgotten about us.  Most of the meal the wait staff was attentive and each waiter that brought our food was knowledgeable.  We had the grilled scallops, fried squid, spicy tuna, glazed ribs and salmon nigiri.  The spicy tuna and glazed ribs (with lime juice) were the best.  Unfortunately, they made a big mistake and charged my card $366 instead of $149 for dinner.  I'd still go back because the food was delicious, but the billing mistake was a huge inconvenience.

Very stuffy.  We ordered the cream of mushroom soup, and for the cost, you would have thought it would have tasted better.  The soup was bland, and there was no salt and pepper to be found.  We did have the truffle fries which were delicious, especially the truffle ketchup and mayo sauce.  My husband and I both ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken.  This salad was also bland, and the dressing was more like paste than dressing.  The colors of the salad were dreadful and the chicken was boiled with no flavor.  I may give this place a second chance because the service was good and there are other good reviews, but if I had to make a judgement on just food...I'd never go back.

Unfortunately, the first thing I smelled upon entering the restaurant was the sewer out front.  However, when I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the rustic, yet classy ambiance.  The ahi tuna and oyster appetizer was delicious.  My husband enjoyed his juice and well seasoned Ribeye steak.  The dessert was an awesome, crunchy, not-too-sweet apple fritter with cream dipping sauce.  I would have have given this place 5 stars, but the waitress forgot about us after dinner was served and it took over 15 minutes to find her to get the check.  We will still return and try some additional dishes.  If you are looking for a "nice, sit-down" restaurant in Cave Creek...this is the place!

I can't speak for the other stylists, but I can speak about Bao Do, the ONLY person I would ever trust with my hair!  I'm asian and have thick, semi-wavy long black hair.  Bao has perfected the ability to texturize my hair so that it is manageable, beautiful and always easy to style.  He also is an expert at highlighting dark, thick, asian hair.  He's both dyed my hair highlighted it,  and the color is perfect.  Bao is a perfectionist so he'll always make sure your hair cut not only makes you happy, but that he is happy with the quality as well.  My hair always grows out beautifully.  He specializes in using all natural beauty products.  On top of his talent he is a kind person.  I hope he never moves out of state, or I might need to move with him!

Oh, how I have missed Chicago Dogs since moving here.  They were good, although one of my buns had a hard bottom.  He claims he bakes them fresh everyday.  The celery salt really made the dog and most of my buns were moist.  I did miss having fresh cut fries...not quite Gene and Judes...but close.

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the wait is just too long on most weekends and their front of house staff doesn't seem Johnny on The Spot all the time.  The food is always great.  We've had the fried chicken-which is rockin!  It's moist and flavorful.  I love the gravy they serve with it.  We've also had the trout and pasta dishes that are very good.  We also love the fondue with pretzels and the House potato chips and dip.  I could take a bath in the dip it's THAT awesome.  Live music on Fridays is great too.  I love the decor in the place too.

We will never return.  My daughter is 14 and got an eyebrow wax.  We usually take her to the local nail salon and they've done a great job, but she wanted to try something new.  My daughter's eyebrows have been so nicely shaped over the years people think they've been tattooed on.  Elle waxed my daughter and after pulling the wax says, "Oh sorry, I took too much off on this one side, but if you keep coming to me I can fix it".  I'm absolutely infuriated.  I had to run my daughter to Nordstrom so a make up artist could help her use shadow to even out the other eyebrow so she didn't have to walk around that way.    I'm thankful she sent me a thank you note in the mail because I couldn't remember her name.  Kudos for the thank you note.

I thought I was going to be in love after seeing this show on Man vs. Food, but I was so disappointed.   1) The Sage Chicken Benedict was featured on Man vs Food but the chicken was dry, the biscuit was cold and the sauce was also luke warm.  The flavor of the cream sauce was tasty, but overall-meh. 2) Their kids choco-chip pancake was the best thing we ate. 3) Waffles were tough, so tough you needed a knife to cut through it.   4) Their Corned Beef Hash was not very flavorful and cheese made the presentation pretty ugly.  I don't think I'll return, especially since the bill was $70 for breakfast.  The restaurant was empty, yet they wouldn't seat our party because 3 people were missing.  The hostess staff was not friendly at all, they made me feel like I had inconvenienced them.  Then we asked for hot chocolate, but the machine was broken.  A few minutes later, they must have fixed it, because other tables had hot chocolate, but our server wasn't aware enough to offer it to us once they could make them again.

I just had the most amazing breakfast...I'm so excited about this place I am typing up this review as I finish my meal.  My husband and I have recently gone "organic" so we have been looking for a breakfast place that catered to this type of clientele.  I had the Hawaiian breakfast that included fried eggs,  fresh roasted pork, cabbage, jasmine rice, fried wontons and a drizzle of soy sauce.  Delish!  I've eaten food in Hawaii and this is exactly what it tastes like!  My husband had the Monte Cristo with strawberry jam at the bottom and if I wasn't soo full from my own meal I'd finish his.  The food came out fast and hot.  I'm contemplating staying here until lunch and eating lunch too, but they may get sick of me so I'll try lunch another day.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious food.  We sat on the patio, which made the experience that much more enjoyable.  If I could choose 6 stars...I would.

We've lived here for over 2 years and recently discovered this quaint place when C4 shut down.  We've been here in the AM and late at night and we love it!  The breakfast food is delish.  You have to try the poptart or their cinnamon bun.  Their hot chocolate is also tasty, and not too sweet.  The prices are very reasonable.  I prefer this place to Starbucks.  In the PM the live music is awesome.  The ambiance is relaxing no matter what time of day you come.

This is a little hidden gem in a mini mall parking lot.  Their spam musubi is amazing, and I embarrassingly think about it when I'm starving sometimes!  Their ma po tofu, bbq chicken and short ribs are also amazing.  I wish their staff was a little more friendly.  Food is great!

3 members of our family have had a few laser hair removal treatment over the past year and have been somewhat satisfied.  We still need to go back for touch ups after spending $1,000 each.  I'm most troubled by my teenage daughter's last touch up treatment for facial hair.  They severely burned her face, and still called afterward asking if she'd like to buy another package to have another area done.  I'm a bit worried about going this to location in the future, they do seem to have a lot of churn and you don't often see the same technician.

I'm editing my last review to give them a stellar rating!!!!  Angel, Nicole, and Briana came and cleaned my house like super heroes yesterday.  They were friendly and worked great as a team.  They were able to clean my 4100 sq ft house in about 3 hours.  My house has seriously never been so clean or smelled so good.   They paid attention to detail and every corner of the house was clean. I can't wait to have them back.  I'd highly recommend them.

We brought our family along with 5 of their friends here for breakfast.  The greeters weren't very good at trying to coordinate seating so we ended up sitting separately from our kids.  The kids promptly put in their order and received their food.  The kids weren't happy with the quality and some barely touched their breakfast.  We waited, and waited, and the kids were done eating for 10 minutes and we still hadn't received our breakfast.  We had only received water, and had not been offered other types of drinks.  We left money for our drinks and proceeded to leave as they decided to bring our food 35 minutes later.  I'll never return, which is sad because we frequent local breakfast places.

I'm surprised more people haven't written a rave review about this agency.  Jason Grandon is an attentive, driven professional and will find you the very best home!  He's goes about and beyond.  If you are new to the area he can also refer you to many people in his network to get help for anything you need.  He's likable and extremely helpful.

Do you have thick asian hair?  Is it impossible to find a good hair cut and an artist that knows how to texturize thick hair?  Look no more!  Bao Do is an amazing hair stylist and he's been cutting my hair for 4 years!! I get compliments on my hair a few times a day, and sometimes I just wash and air dry!  He's a color artist, too!  My ombre highlights turned out fabulous.  I'll never let another stylist touch my hair.  Go see Bao-NOW! :)

My husband tans here regularly because they seem to have better beds than some salons, however the service is very inconsistent.  My husband has driven to the location at opening time and on a few occasions the person opening shows up 15+ minutes late.  Pretty unprofessional, huh? They should considering hiring a more reliable person to open the store.  The lady that showed up late, does however arrive with a cup of hot coffee.  She should probably consider skipping the coffee to arrive on time.

Loved that they gave you so many vegetable to put in your soup.  Some places get stingy.  The chicken Pho was amazing and the staff was so friendly.  The soup came out fast and piping hot!

I'm so surprised this salon doesn't have better ratings from other customers.  I had an amazing experience at this salon.  The owner did my nails and Kevin took care of my pedicure.  The pedicure was so relaxing, and they used awesome products to make my feet smooth.  He spent a long time massaging my legs and feet, which felt so great!  The owner was wonderful too.  Her no chip manicure has lasted me a long time, and the quality of her manicure was great.  She really loves her customers and the salon is beautiful and clean.  I don't live close, but will travel 20 minutes+ just to get my nails done!

Food is good,  Their fat free dressing is pretty yummy too.  And if you love shakes, you must try EVERY SINGLE shake flavor they offer.

I would have given them more stars if there greeters would have greeted me.  I had to interrupt them chatting with each other to ask to put my name on the list.  Banana cream pancakes were amazing and so were the red velvet and Rick's Adobo fried rice!  We love this place!

Food is usually very good and the staff is very attentive.  I love their ginger beer too.  We've come with very large parties and they do a fab job at getting our food out fast and hot.

Just as awesome as the other location.  I love that this is a family run business.  This location is super clean, and I love that they have so many places to sit.  The food is always top notch, fresh and comes out fast.

New ownership has really whipped things into shape!  Amazing service, friendly nail artists and the massages are fabulous!!! I've gotten the premium pedicure, which is worth every dollar-and the gel mani.

Food is always piping hot and fresh. Sides are always so good especially their gravy.  I'd agree with some other reviews that the drive through process probably needs some help and they should offer condiments like honey and hot sauce. Luckily I'm always headed home after, but usually they forget my utencils too.
