Not the cheapest carpet cleaners out there but definitely the BEST! I had a funky smell in my new master bedroom...Dan Law and his team to the rescue. The techs were prompt and professional. They went above and beyond to be sure I had a good result. They cleaned my 14+year old chenille furniture and it looks like NEW! Well worth the $$$. I will use them again and recommend them to anyone who wants a thorough clean of carpet or upholstery (AND they clean windows too!)

I went with my hubby for dinner on a Saturday night. I have to say that I am a foodie and have very high expectations...that being said, after this first experience, I almost didn't go back (Read another review about my 2nd experience). I ordered a steak panini and he got a burger. Pieces of meat were thick and overcooked and had no seasoning. Sweet potato fries had no taste at all. My husband's burger was not tasty or juicy. Service was attentive and friendly but the food was NOT good! Overpriced, underseasoned and not properly cooked. As excited as we are to have a fast casual restaurant in the area I do not feel like it hit the mark.
