The zoo is pretty big. I liked playing with the sting rays and walking around looking at the animals during the day. Whenever I go to Zoolights during the night, everything is asleep.  It's the usual zoo with your jungle, desert and whatever animals. There's plenty of shops and snack shops. You can go on a tour, ride the camel, go on the slides (which is really expensive because it's $3 per ride going down a slide), get up close with the giraffes and even get up close with the elephants.  Good place to take the kids and spend an entire day there. Let them look at the animals and also about them too. Bring some water and snacks so you don't have to pay for it at the zoo.  Oh... FREE PARKING.

This is one of the places where I can say Japanese food has a little uniqueness to it. I like the whole Japanese Italian Cafe and Bakery look to it. It reminds me of the spin that the restaurants in Japan does too.  I had the Tekka Don. Which was a sashimi rice bowl. It was good. Practically, it was a tuna roll not rolled up and put into a bowl. I used to get the Ika Mentai but that's becoming boring a bit.  The atmosphere is nice but you can definitely expect a wait. For the love of everything delicious, don't go to one of those American chains pretending to be a Japanese restaurant. :cough cough: Ra Sushi.

We call this Gay Denny's or Jenny's.   It's really like any other Denny's. There's no reason for you to drive to this one because it makes more sense to go to the one in your neighborhood. Usually, we go to this one when there's an event in Downtown Phoenix. It's nearby.  Other reasons that I go? My friends are poor and Denny's open late. Otherwise, you should never eat at Denny's.

Be sure to order the authentic Chinese food here. Meaning not the sweet and sour chicken or lo mein or something! The place seems pretty busy and the staff is pretty quick on their feet.  We ordered a bunch of food that I don't even know the name of in English. We just know the names in Chinese and from the Chinese menu. We can give it generic names like roast duck, roast pork belly, beef stew, Chinese broccoli, walnut shrimp, etc. It was good and authentic. Price is not bad. If you know how to do it right, you can come here with a group of people, order an authentic family style meal for a reasonable price.  A good way to test it is if it's not on the Panda Express menu, it's probably authentic. Although I love PE's beef and broccoli. I don't know why but I love it.

The airport is not a bad airport at all. It's actually better than a lot of airports! I love that the roadways leading in and out of the airport is not too confusing. The only terminal that is confusing is #2 because it's not connected to the main building.   But it's nice inside. It has all of the usual restaurants and magazine stores and coffee shops. The coolest place is La Grande Orange. I was surprised that there was one in there in terminal 4. Good restaurant for food!  The place is pretty clean too. It's very well kept. They started upgrading the entire place. Now there's LCD boards giving you information on the roadways, recharge stations inside and a sky train that takes you to the light rail station. For free. To ride the light rail is not free. But you can be dropped off at the airport light rail station and take the sky train directly to the main check-in building.   The airport only keeps getting better. :)

Went back to try their other dishes. This time I had the Breakfast Tacos at the suggestions of one of the hostess at the front. It was very tasty and twice is good as the last dish I tried which was the Potencia. I ate those Breakfast Tacos and was quite full. The tacos had no meat and was filled with egg whites which was quite unique. It went very well with the salsa, beans, avocado and green Tabasco sauce. The tastiness was there!  Staff was accommodating and very friendly. Orange juice was awesome like last time. Next time I go, I'll try their Organic Apple Juice and have their staff recommend something good again.

This is the good Waffle House! It's cleaner and service is faster than the other ones I been to.  Waffle House has some pretty cheap food. I always and usually go for the Hashbrowns all the way. It's only $4... and it's a lot of food with ham, gravy, chili, potatoes, jalapenos, mushrooms, etc. Probably not the healthiest food but you can't have everything.  The menu has a good variety from burgers to waffles to pancakes to steak and eggs and a lot of stuff that you would expect for breakfast and lunch. And this place opens late! Actually, it could be 24 hours... I think I went to one at 3 a.m. before....  It's a cheap late night eats place. You know what you are getting into when you come here. ;)

The pizza was loaded with toppings and I was impressed with the taste. Usually, I'm into the really fancy pizza, but the taste of Barro's  is a good competition to them given their price point and size. :)  I may just skip Papa John's from now on.

If I want cheesecake, this is the place to go. The decor is nice and the cheesecakes are super nice. They are open a little later than some restaurants too and the staff is friendly.  The appetizers were decent and so is the food. For the service and the atmosphere, of course you are paying more. But did I mention cheesecake?  Lots of variety of cheesecakes. There's also other desserts as well on the menu. I would have to say this is not the healthiest place to eat since a lot of food is fried and there's an abundance of sugar food available staring at you.

It definitely looks more pleasing than your average fast food place. But then again, paying eight to nine dollars for fast food is kind of expensive.  I'm thinking you can get more food at a cheaper price with comparable atmosphere somewhere else. Who knows. Maybe I'm a cheapskate.  AND THEY RAN OUT OF NAPKINS at lunch time. That's a first for a fast food place...

The place looks nice and the food came out pretty quick. Looking at the menu, the selection is not much and prices looked comparable to places that had better food and selections. It doesn't taste bad and service is ok. If you are looking something convenient, this might be a good place. Although there are only a few locations in the valley so it may not be that convenient after all. lol

I dislike US Airways so much. It's like the people working there are incompetent and... incompetent. There's no other word for it. Told them I had an international flight to make in a hurry and they said, we can't help you. Had to wait in line... and when I got to the front, they said, International Flight is the other check in area. It was completely empty. Freaking wasted my time!  Everyone I talked to had this non-caring attitude along with not knowing what's going on. I asked them where I needed to go for International Flights after landing at SFO and they were really confused. That and they printed a non-valid International boarding pass for me at SFO. Security said I had to go back to the check in area to get another one.  Luckily, someone from Singapore Airlines saw what was happening and did something about it. Instead of making me wait in line at check in, they walked with me from going through security all the way to the departure gate and printed me another boarding pass for the flight. That's what I call service and just helping someone out. And that's why so many people like Singapore Airlines. Friendly, competent employees.

Here is the breakdown... cheap authentic Chinese food. Be sure to order off the Chinese menu and not the American menu. One menu contains sweet and sour pork/chicken/beef. That's the menu for all the Americans that have never really know what the difference between Chinese food and Panda Express.  Here's is what YOU ARE NOT going to get... fast service, atmosphere and whatever you expect from a restaurant. But like I said, you get cheap authentic Chinese food.  Recommended dishs include Whole Steamed Fish, Roast Pork, Stir Fry Crab/Lobster, Steamed Flounder, Sea Cucumber, Black Sauce Clams, Beef Claypot, etc.  If you can't understand the concept above, go eat at Panda Express or PF Chang and enjoy your Sweet and Sour Chicken.

This place has been here for years. For years! I have been coming for years. For years! I still think this place has the best combination of quality dim sum, decor and other menu items. The variety here is just awesome.   Golden Buddha, China King, Mekong Plaza, they were decent. Those places were good because you don't really want to travel that far for dim sum and those places were in their respective areas. Except Golden Buddha closed.   But for a complete experience, go to Great Wall. You should go on Sundays around 10:30am. That's when their menu is at it's fullest. Asian people go out Sunday mornings haha. There might be a wait but carts will come by more often, more items and you get to see a lot of Asian people. There are also items that are not on carts. Like giant noodle dishes. Don't miss out on them!

I like this place because it's unique. The restaurant is actually in a basement of the building hence the name Salt Cellar. I always go during Happy Hour when prices are cheaper because this place is rather expensive. Oh seating is not suitable for really large groups. There's a bar and then there are smaller tables in a separate small room.  Other than the prices, the food is good and the atmosphere is great. It has that private posh bar feel with dim lighting. Try the turtle soup, steamed mussels and the raw oysters. The steamed mussels can be eaten without any sauce. It's that tasty. The escargot is nice too. The baked oyster was kind of bland. But you'll have to try it yourself.  This place is for people that want to be fancy for the night. Eat and drink like an important person. Service is not bad and the food is good. And like I said, it's unique atmosphere. Just be prepared to pay the premium for it.

WOOT WOOT MY 100TH REVIEW!  Four Peaks is in the heart of Tempe and it's a great place to be. It has a good night scene, and during the day, it has the whole brunch atmosphere going on. It's relaxing without the dive look.  So whatever time during the day or night, Four Peaks is never a poor choice. The beer is good and the seasonal beers are even better. Food is good with fast and friendly staff too.  Love the burgers, the nachos and the chicken tenderloins. You should try the tiramisu dessert too!

They have a good variety of comics, figures, toys and games. Staff is nice and seems to know what they are doing. And there's always events happening here.  Good place to buy stuff or just chill sometime and look at all the cool stuff. Nearby food places are convenient too. The only gripe is that free parking inside the parking lot is limited. You can park at the meters if you want to pay however.

The cool thing about this restaurant is that it's right next to ASU campus. Whether it's after class, after you wake up with a hangover or after a late night party, you can always go get some food.  I guess the more convenient, the worst everything else gets. Not that I will stop coming here but the service, attitude and general environment is pretty lousy. Usually short staff and food takes forever to cook.  There are much better IHOP restaurants but they are not as busy as this one. Go here for convenience. Go elsewhere for better service.

Very good atmosphere and experience. Wasn't expecting it to be that nice inside since the outside of the building is kind of plain but it was! It had decorations and a clear view of the stage.  The servers were very attentive. Almost to the point of distracting us from the show but there's nothing that can be done about that. Bryan Callen was very funny. I haven't laughed so hard in months.   I ordered a Mad TV Long Island and it was pretty strong. And then we also had a popcorn shrimp dish which was equally delicious. After the show, met up with Bryan Callen and took a picture with him. So that was cool as well. If you don't know Bryan Callen, he's the guy in all of those comedy movies with Adam Sandler, Vince Vaughn, etc. THAT ONE GUY. haha.  So if you want some good laughs, come here!  Note: Just be aware of the prices. The tickets were $20 each with fees that add up to almost another $4. Two tickets for $48. And there's a two drink minimum once you get inside. The signature drink I ordered was $15. Beers are probably cheaper and coffee is $3.

Before 10pm, the Long Island Ice Teas are $5. And they are pretty big. It's a good spot to be for cheap alcohol and the place is not too bad either. Dark and HDTVs.  And you can play pool too.

This place is way busy but I find that it's a good place to go if you want to chill for a bit while you are on Mill ave. They have your usual Starbucks drinks and staff and other amenities.  But if you don't want crowded, you may want to avoid this place. There's a lot of people from the bars, ASU and random people that come in especially at night. But hey, this is the only Starbucks and when you got to have that coffee, you gotta have it. haha!

I came here a few years ago. Pho tasted bland. Just came back recently because a bunch of people were going... still tasted the same bland flavor. Seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it. It's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in Tempe.  There's Pho Cao (good) and Khai Hoan (very good). Try those places in Tempe. Better pho places are even better in Mesa. Strong broth. Lots of meat.

Each Saturday, there's a limited serving of Japanese noodles from ramen to udon to whatever. It's fresh and authentic. I have eaten ramen all over Japan, SoCal, NorCal and throughout the world. Trust me on this!  So this place is not a restaurant, by the way. It's actually a small grocery market that they set up some plastic chairs and tables in the corner of the store. You can actually buy bento boxes or other food items or drinks and sit down to enjoy it. It's a local Japanese grocery store!  Ok, but back to the ramen/udon. Each week, you can check on their facebook page for the noodle bowl of the week. You come in and order and there's really small staff in the back preparing your food. Everyone in there is Japanese and speaks Japanese. I actually sat with these two old Japanese ladies that came in for ramen and we talked about Japan and AZ when they first got here in the 1960s. That was awesome.  Like I said before, it gets pretty packed and they run out of noodles usually in an hour. Come early and eat the delicious food. You can walk over to the freezer and buy yourself a Japanese drink too. Afterwards, you can go next door to the Japanese bakery and get dessert.  There's really no other place like this in the Phoenix area so come try it out.

The place definitely has atmosphere. The decor is great. Came in here for a quick snack and the experience was good. Ordered the St. Petersburg which is basically chips topped with cucumber, beats, cream cheese and salmon (although it could have used more salmon). It tasted fine, and the "Hot Dog" drink was not bad either.  Prices are up there a bit, but what do you expect from Scottsdale? I say it's a good place to come in for a drink or quick bite. Other than that, their menu seems to be sandwiches, burgers, and a few plates.  Definitely a place to stop by if you are on a night out with friends and you want that posh experience!

One thing about this McDonald's is that the decor has been revamped. It's a very nice McDonalds when you look at everything. However, that's as far as it goes.  Good thing I'm only coming in for something off the value menu but I say you are better off going somewhere else. Or even a different McDonald's. The one on McClintock and University is nice. Go to that one.  The service at this one by ASU is pretty lousy. I had a person that couldn't even answer my questions. A manager was there to interpret back to the person at the register. And another time, they couldn't even answer what a certain sandwich contains when they DID speak English. I don't know what these people are doing but it's definitely not their job.

I have been going to this event for so long that I can't even count on my hands. It's gotten bigger and bigger every year. Now there's even more vendors, more people, more activities, more cosplaying, more everything! I am guessing around 5 to 6 thousand people over the weekend and possibly more.  Well, if you haven't been here, you should come. A lot of local Asian restaurants set  up in tents to serve you their food. However, the food is expensive. There's other organizations here too from non-profit to schools to other random clubs. And then there are merchandise vendors selling trinkets, souvenirs, anime, plants, etc. If you are not in the mood to buy food or merchandise, you can always come hang out. It's free! There's also a beer garden area... not free though. Haha.  Besides just looking around at food and merchandise, there are plenty of performances on 3 stages throughout the festival ranging from dances, kendo demonstrations, cosplay contests, concerts and much more. It's a packed schedule and everyone that sets up this entire event does a really good job.  It's a great place to spend on Saturday or Sunday, and this only happens once a year. It's like the Renaissance Festival except Japanese stuff. And the younger people dress up as fictional characters from the favorite Japanese anime or game instead of knights and kings at the Ren Faire. And some dress in kimonos or other Japanese outfits. Well, 90% of the people are in normal clothes so don't worry... Just come enjoy the good times and warmish weather. :)

I like trying out furniture. I mean, I REALLY like trying out furniture before I buy. Get a feel of how well you can use it before you make that purchase. And you want to make the right purchase because no likes to be wrong in life. And returning things, especially furniture, is like graduating high school with a 3.5 GPA. Doesn't say very good things about your work ethic.   Good thing Ikea has everything set up for you. Just go in and enjoy any version of a living room, bedroom or kitchen that you like. If you don't like it, move onto the next one.  I don't know why the TV don't play DVDs. I would have bought some meatballs and drinks at the restaurant, popped some popcorn in the microwave, and sat down with my date to enjoy a simple movie.  You may want to avoid rush hours and the huge number of children. I suggest going... actually, there's ALWAYS kids in Ikea. So no, you won't be able to enjoy the movie on that fancy couch quietly (if that TV was even able to play a DVD in the first place). And I think the employees purposely hide the remote too.   WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE TV DOESN'T HAVE A REMOTE? Every TV comes with a remote.  Too bad the water in the bathroom displays don't work. I would have like to see what it would have been like to shower there and get ready before my date arrived. I tried telling her that all of the decor was my own style. I obtained my style from the interior decorating degree that I got at ASU. But she just gave me a weird look because a lot of the furniture had European names. And she knows I'm not European.  After the movie, I decided I was going to buy something.  Whatever I want to buy for my actual living space in real life, I would get it at the very end of the store. Every single piece of furniture is all packaged and ready to go in the giant warehouse. Too bad I'm not a heavy lifter. Nor do I have a big car. So make sure you come with a big car and a strong person to do the heavy lifting of your furniture.  And also build it for you when you get home.   Good place for furniture. Not recommended for dates who can't lift heavy things for you.

All of the bad reviews are because of overcharging and scamming you. IT'S TRUE.  The beef schwarma was good. And the service was decent and maybe somewhat slow for a tiny place.  The thing that I didn't like was that they SECRETLY OVER CHARGE YOU. So the beef schwarma is $5.99 and the total bill came out to be $7.79 which meant they charged me $1.80 for tax. It wasn't only me... it was my other friends as well. That's a 23% tax onto my order. Like WTF???  I didn't say anything because my friend said that's what they always do. And when I read all of the other negative reviews on here, it's the same story. Well, they are not doing that to me again. Peace out! :)

Delicious Mexican Food. Those are the three words to describe it. I have eaten almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed.  It's authentic. I really love the red tamales, the tacos and the pollo fundidos. Pile a bunch guacamole on there and it's food heaven. :)  I really like their chips too. Order a bag one time and snacked on it with guacamole and salsa for a few days.

I like this location better than the Chandler one. It has more of that cozy atmosphere. Same products and all but ambiance is just better.  The best location I been to was in Seoul, South Korea. It actually had the same ambiance as this location too! They said that that SK location was the number 1 rated location in the world. And I believe that. The service was amazing, and the staff was attentive and knowledgeable. It was like Nordstrom service. The staff was in sync and performed demonstrations for everyone on a personal level. Same size store but 13 staff members running around compared to the 3 that were here in this Lush.  Oh well, I came here for the products anyway. Buy the facial masks! :)

The food was good. What did we eat?  We had the Jumbo Shrimp, The Blackened Mahi, The Mahi burger, The Trout and something I can't remember. For dessert, we had the bread pudding and the white chocolate brownie.  I recommend the Blackened Mahi (not the burger). For some reason, the burger came out cold and not cooked. The regular dish came out fine. Plus, crab on top of Mahi... how can you go wrong? It's delicious. But if you get a bad burger, let them know ASAP.  Service was pretty decent. The desserts are probably what they are good at it. The main dishes were ok... So if you are here for desserts, it will be less of a disappointment. But if you are in the area looking for a posh place to eat, this is it.

It's Subway! It's probably the most food that you are going to get for $5. This subway is pretty clean and fast. It helps that it's in a rich neighborhood. Beware that it does get busy during certain hours of the day.  Are there better subs? Most likely. But not for $5.

Authentic Chinese food place because everyone talks in Chinese. There's mostly Americanized Chinese food, but they taste pretty good so I'll give it a pass.  We ordered a Mandarin dinner with 8 plates. The apps were decent... usual egg roll and crab puffs. The wonton soup was very bland. Moo shuu was probably the most delicious thing they served. The kung pao chicken, moo goo gai pan, beef with broccoli and shrimp dish gets a decent pass. The squid was also kind of lacking. There was a spicy pork dish and a dish I can't remember the name of that tasted pretty good. Overall, the entire meal didn't disappoint.   And the service was nice as they kept filling out tea, water and rice. And then packed out to go boxes and everything. When it comes to Chinese restaurants, I'm usually harsh but this place did just enough things right to get the four stars.

Totally wasn't expecting this place to be good but it is! I think for the low price, you get your food fast and it's a pretty decent amount. And the taste is great.  I ordered Original Gyro and chose the side of salad that was included for $7. Very nice tasting for both. I have been to other places where that same price was only for a gyro with no salad. Overall, it was pretty filling and I would come back again for a satisfying meal.  Cheap, really tasty, fast, and filling. Yep, meets all my criteria for good restaurant.

I actually fly Southwest 99% of the time and I fly a pretty good amount. I actually consider SW the best airline for the price conscious consumer. I'll list some of the factors below...  1. Prices on airline tickets are fairly cheap. Not Spirit or Allegiant Air cheap. But those two airlines charge for every little thing you request. EVERY LITTLE THING HAS A FEE.  2. Two bags fly free is awesome. You don't have to sign up for a credit card or do anything. FREE. I went on American Airlines and it was $25 for my first bag and $35 for my second. That's like over $100 roundtrip with a more expensive ticket.  3. The attendants are nicer than the other airlines from what I experienced. And the cabin is pretty nice too with the leather seats.  4. Free pretzels, water, peanuts and non-alcoholic drinks. Just recently, they offered free on board TV streaming to mobile devices. Not a very good selection of channels but the TV shows like The Office was not bad.  5. Change flights without a fee. Just pay the flight difference. See the same flight a cheaper price? Change it and get credit back for your next flight. WHAT??? Yeah, it's true. Try it sometime. After you buy your ticket, check out the prices for the next few weeks... if it dips, just change your flight and get credit back. Same deal if you book with points. You get the points difference back.  So there you have it. There's a lot of stuff I like about SW but these are probably the big ones.  EXTRA TIP: You need to finish checking your bags about 50 minutes before departure. Otherwise, the bags will be flown on the next flight and you'll have to wait for your bags and get a $50 credit. But they will deliver it to your hotel or wherever if you can't wait and not give you the $50 credit.

The taste is authentic. Really like the pork chops and ribs. Not expecting any service whenever going to an authentic Chinese restaurant.  It's just that the menu only had a few items. They had more items on the Asian menu which I couldn't read so that wasn't helpful.  Basically, no service with little choice on the menu. I would do take out instead next time.

Art supplies are expensive! I guess they are expensive in general. But the prices here aren't toooooo bad. I can always go to Walmart and get some cheap paint and paint brushes.  But this place is good for better quality paint. I can get Soho acrylic paints and Montana Gold spray paints. The vibrant colors, you can't get that at Walmart.

Way overpriced. The pastrami sandwich was good though. It had a good flavor, but I can't justify $12.99 for a sandwich and a little cup of potato salad. Now I'm not just talking about this sandwich. The rest of the menu was overpriced as well. Even the kids menu. Items on there were up to 8 or 9 dollars.  Service was ok. Seems that there are better places to spend your money than here. Like fancier places...

Good for social events that need lots of space but that's really it.  The games here are mostly ticket games and generic gun shooters catered to American people. I guess that's why it's called Dave & Busters.  At least Gameworks have more variety of games. I can't believe I'm saying Dance Dance Revolution is variety but yes.

The food was not bad. I enjoyed eating the salad and it seemed like some time was put into the making of it. It was packed with meat, veggies, etc. I can taste the flavor, and it looked presentable. SO for some quick food with decent prices and some good flavor, I do recommend this place.  If you are on a budget, this is the place!

I used to go to YC's all the time but this place has been replacing it. I am not sure why... maybe the $1 sake during happy hour?  Anyway, today there was a special for $6.99 bowls so my friends and I went. There's a variety of ingredients like bacon, sausage, pepperoni, chicken, beef, scallops, calamari, white fish, etc. Then there's the veggies and then the sauces.  The portions are definitely smaller than YC's. I still managed to get a pretty good amount of food into my bowl. At YC's, you have a bigger bowl and it's easier to smash everything into it. Here... not so much. But I found a way around it. Build a wall with broccoli and essentially make your bowl twice as big. It's a work of art and architecture in the end.  Sauces and flavors are good. Variety. Nice place to hang out with friends. :) Just make it work your buck. Pack it in!

Cheap gas! Only takes American Express at the pump though. Possibly your debit card but never tried.  But yeah, gas is cheaper here than around the area in any area. You'll probably save that much money even if it costs you a membership. Oh yeah, you have to swipe your membership card to get gas too.

The service was great here. Every time we come, there's about 30 of us and they still get us our food in a timely manner.  The pho and vermicelli that I eat every time were ok. Nothing special but if you are in the neighborhood, you can stop by. Although there's another pho place in the same plaza. The pho soup there has intense flavors. Both are the same price just about.  Come here for the fast and warm service, not the food.

One of the more reliable places to dine at Tempe Marketplace. You actually get a decent full meal and you get what you expect... Mexican food... ish. Whatever Chipotle is, that is what you get. Nothing fancy, nothing too terrible and at the price you expect, and I have to admit, it fills you up.  It's your typical fast food place but I do really enjoy Chipotle, and this location hasn't let me down yet. There are other options in the mall, but sometimes, it's the cheaper things you want and getting what you are expecting.

This is a great place to eat ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI. It's $20. If you think you will spend at least $15 for sushi at some other restaurant, just come here. Eat until you explode. And the thing is, the sushi is pretty good!  I usually don't prefer sushi restaurants that is not run by Japanese people but this is fine. They do a good job. The order for all you can eat can be rolls, or nigiri pieces. If you ask nicely and have a large group, they may even through in sashimi.  Don't be dumb. Come here for you sushi. Unless you are planning to spend less than $15. Then go to Teharu down the street. Wow, I just saved you a lot of money.

I don't know... I was hoping for wings. But they said they were out of wings and a bunch of other food on the menu. My friends ordered the 2 garlic knots and they came out very burnt. At least they gave us a free order of garlic knots.  The pizza was expensive and tasted really bland. That's really disappointing for a $14 personal pan pizza. And when I showed my Yelp check in coupon for $2 off, they said they don't accept it. They did accept after some discussion and said it will be their "one time courtesy" toward me. They should really take that check-in offer.  Overall, bad food and bad service. I don't know what these other positive reviews are about but there are better pizza places with better pizza out there. And a full menu to boot.

This is a really good recreational center. Plenty of dance rooms, space, equipment and even a indoor running track. There's TVs and couches and vending machines too! Outside of the center is a giant park. And plenty of parking.  I love that dance and workout classes are held here. Of course, if you want to host your own, you can sign up to do that too. Whatever activity you want to do, I'm sure they are equipped for it. During the summer days, the indoor running track will keep you cool and prevent sunburn! Check this place out!  There are fees for using the place so be sure to check the website. You are charged less if you are a Chandler resident the last time I checked.

NEGATIVE 5 stars if possible.   I'm not trying to be racist here, there's this fat African American lady who gave me so much attitude at the register. Sooooo much attitude like I insulted her children or something. Soooo much attitude like it's her entitlement to be that way. Every time she rolled her eyes at me and belittled me, asking for my ID, telling me not to touch the credit card pin pad, telling me one item per customer for some reason, etc.  I didn't even get "thank you for coming to Best Buy" cuz I got "here is your receipt, please leave."   I told her manager. She just stared at me from the register like she was going to kill me, and the other customers were just waiting.   So when other reviewers say the staff here is crazy... take their word for it. Never coming back for safety reasons.

Sushi goes on conveyor belt, rolls them in front you, and you take the ones you like. It's that simple. They count up your plates at the end and charge you. You can come here and eat all the $1 sushi you want!  Sushi is cheap. If you get $1 plates, you can spend $7 for 14 pieces of sushi. if you get the rolls, it will be more expensive. Please do not get the can of fruit or cheesecake. Those are designed for suckers.  The sushi is not premium sushi or prepared with the best technique.   But for a fun atmosphere, cheap food and this gimmick with the conveyor belt, this place hits the spot. Just don't come during dinner and you could be waiting 30 minutes to get seated. I come here because all of my friends love this place. And what's eating sushi without good friends, right? :)

Starting to see these coffee places pop up everywhere. It's a good alternative to Starbucks or... wherever else they serve coffee. The coffee place is more of a room where the staff makes the coffee. The seats are patio seats really. You can get your coffee through drive through as well.  Not bad. For me it's convenience. If one is near by and Starbucks is not around, then Dutch Bros Coffee it is! It will save you some gas although I'm sure the next Starbucks is not too far from you.

Been here a few times and every time, the service seemed very slow...  Looks like there's plenty of people moving about but no service was being given. The food wasn't too bad. The bottomless fries were fine. Once I even substituted for bottomless broccoli. Of all the typical burger places with this kind of atmosphere, this place can do better.  Last time, I ordered a Chili Chili Burger and there was barely any chili on it even though on the menu, it was painting an image of a lot of chili on this awesome hamburger. Turns out, it was just a hamburger. :/

Delicious! And the staff was nice.  I love the sauce on the food and can't seem to get enough of it. Smells GREAT! I had the beef brisket. I hope it was that... not that I think about. I can't recall exactly what the meat was. The bread was really good for some reason. Better than I would have expected. So the place is not bad. I haven't decided if I like Tom's BBQ's sauce better or not yet.  Plan on coming again to try some more variety of food.

It's a nice hotel. I think it's one of the nicer ones downtown. I'm not too fond of the layouts and where only certain levels go to certain floors.  However, the ambiance is good and I love the restaurant that's connected to the hotel. The food there is pretty good. I also love that there's a bar in the lobby too so you can have a good time whenever you want.  I stayed here multiple times and it hasn't disappointed. It's definitely nicer than a Four Points Sheraton! Haha. But you get what you pay.

Great late night hours. Anything late night makes me a fan. Pretty cheap hotdogs as well and the staff is super friendly. I thought this was a restaurant but just turns out to be a grill, cooler and some tables under a tent in a parking lot of a comic book store lol.   Although I'm a fan, I thought their hotdogs were ok. I definitely had better. The buns were big and the hotdog itself was small. Plus I couldn't taste the distinct flavors that I would with other hotdog stands around other parts of the country.   Portillos, Japan Dogs and other generic bacon wrapped hotdogs kinda tastes better. But hey, they are not open that late or don't exist in the Phoenix area. So this is pretty awesome for existing. Especially when the central Phoenix/Biltmore area is dead around 10pm!

The atmosphere seems pretty rocking and everyone inside was looking sweet! I saw many drinks that looked super delicious as well. Good vibe, I must say.  The decor and construction of the place and the furniture makes the place unique. I went to the bathroom and was very confused at first because the doors blended into the wall. And there were some awesome mirrors on the second floor with great lighting. I took pictures of myself. Haha.  But yeah, 4 minute walk from the light rail and pretty cool posh place to hang out on a Friday night. I say worth it!

There's nothing fancy about this place. And it shouldn't be fancy. All you need to know is that it's REAL Mexican food, with a good chance of getting sick and also a good chance of getting robbed while eating at the tables.   This neighborhood is somewhat dangerous. I ate at a taco stand in Mexico and had the same two feelings. It's legit.  The unhealthy food tastes good!

This is mostly based on the ramen and not their other dishes. And ramen is only served like 4 hours a week. However, I think I found the best ramen in Arizona. I say Arizona because the other places in Arizona aren't that great.  Posh actually gets it right in flavor, texture and other things. I have had ramen in CA, WA, and even Japan. This place at least creates a ramen that let's you know that they know what they are doing.  Is it the best I have ever had? No. But it's pretty darn good. Especially here in the desert. I had the Miso ramen with the onsen egg (it was delicious). The chasui pork was so yummy as well. It melts in your mouth and sort of melts in your chopsticks if you don't hold it right. The flavor of the broth was great. It wasn't watery. You can tell that the flavor is blended into the liquid.  I wish the parking structure was easier to find (I parked at Macy's at Fashion Square) and I wish it wasn't so darn expensive. We are talking about a $12 base price! I guess when you have the good stuff and no one can match you in taste, you can raise the prices a little bit.  Overall, BEST ramen in Arizona as of right now this moment. 4/19/2015.

I think a lot of post office runs the same way. Could it be better? HELL YES.  So why does this get 5 stars? Because it's open on Saturdays until 4pm!!! (I'll update my review if their hours ever change and give them 2 stars)  Most post offices don't open on Saturdays and if they do, they close at 12pm. You'll have to go to the main processing center in Phoenix for the only other post office to be open as late. The only thing about this small post office is they don't accept big packages. Only small ones and letters. If you only use UPS or Fedex, then this doesn't matter. HAHAHA.  I wish I could work in a post office so I can get out at noon... wait, no I don't...

It's a really nice place for a date! You can walk around the park-ish area and the scenery is great. They have that LOVE sign and a bunch of fountains. Usually you see other couples, families or photographers doing photo shoots nearby. And if you fancy some good food, there are also restaurants in the civic center. There are garages right next to the center so parking shouldn't be a problem either.  AZ88 is a nice place to lounge around on an afternoon or evening. It's located on the West side of the civic center.  If you really want, you can walk over to Old Town Scottsdale for food as well.

I really loved this place. I went here for brunch and ordered bruschetta, the prosciutto panini and the chicken mozzarella panini with a bellini drink.  The bruschetta was awesome. I had the salmon, bacon, proscuitto and something else I can't remember at the moment. Highly delicious. Especially the salmon and the proscuitto. Equally amazing were the two panini. So worth it because I was had to take some home too! Too much food.  The atmosphere was nice with lots of light during the day and the server was attentive. It's a good place to bring a date, friends or family. I'm so glad there's one in Tempe now too. I gotta go try that one!   I'm going to try going at night too and see how it feels. :)

I like this location because it always seems more spacious than other locations. The staff is pretty friendly and it's located in a nice plaza. You can treat it like a dessert place especially if you came from In & Out Burger or any other food place in the plaza.   Flavors are great. I always love Yogurtland flavors and they seem to have the most flavors out of a lot of places I visit.   Usually, I go with coconut and pistachio flavor with some popping bubbles. Don't forget to check in!

The selection here is huge! However, the quality of the food is decent. I ended  up eating the crab legs... like 4 plates because that was the best value. I tried some of the sushi was ok compared to places that served great sushi. The steak was terrible. It was like cafeteria food for most items. Definitely not made with refined tastes or skill.  So yeah, crab legs and some deserts and other random items is what is good. The waitress was decent, but the all you can drink menu was terrible. I think it said the drinking period was only two hours and the drinks were weak. WEAK and diluted.  I heard better things about other buffets but this one was opened a little later than the others and we wanted plenty of time to eat.

The first time I ate the fries, I hated it. But then, I got used to them. Now, they taste really good! I eat at In-N-Out Burger so much. Food is usually healthier. It's relatively cheap. And Service is pretty good if the employees are competent.  I eat pretty healthy and I eat a lot. The best thing about this place is you can eat a lot in a healthy way for cheap. So just protein style hamburger (the custom order where they replace the bread with lettuce). Then just add extra onion, extra tomatoes and extra pickles for free. That's like a salad in itself. And for how much? $2.11 with tax. Not bad. ;)  If you really want to pig out, then order the animal style fries. It's not healthy. It has cheese and dressing and whatever they put in there. Or a 4x4 and some fries and shake. It's good. Just not healthy. But I love this place!

This store used to be a Mervyn's but it was transformed into a Walmart. The store is quite small given that it also has a grocery section. In the grocery section of the store, you would find what you would normally look for. However, if you look in the clothing, electronics, office, etc. sections, the selections of items are very few compared to other Walmarts.  This location is convenient for those in the area since the other Walmarts are at least 10 away. The place is just very cramped and it lacks the items that other Walmarts have. Prices are still cheap though so at least you have that.  I would say if you are in the area, then go to it. If you are looking for a variety of items, you would want to go to the other nearest Walmarts... which are the bigger ones on either Baseline/Country Club or the one on Elliot/Priest.

I think this is my place of choice for specials. There are specials (food and drink) every day of the week. Usually, the long island ice tea is my choice because it's only $4 on certain days. Also, $5 wings and $6 whole pizzas on other days. $5 giant mugs of beer too for the specials.   A lot of times, I only go on days with the long island special. The food is not bad for a sports bar and grill. I had the steak nachos, pizza and wings before and they were good. Depending on the days, service could be slow especially if there is a college game day or just a lot of people there.  What you should do is go on their website, see what they have on that day, and decide if you want to go. That's the best way to do it. Because some specials don't apply on college game days.  And plan out your trip with the light rail if you don't want to drive. It's a 5 minute walking distance from the University and Rural station. Then go drink and take the rail back home. Or take the rail Mill Ave for more drinks.  Like I said, check their website for the happy hour menu and the daily specials. Then decide if you want to go. There's also a sushi restaurant across the street, and a shwarma, Indian, Thai and pizza place next door too. If you don't want food at DA's, grab cheap drinks and go eat elsewhere.  Or grab some drinks and go to Fedex Kinkos next door to hang out. I'm sure the employees will love that. ;)

I like that they carry such a variety of Asian food products. The meat and fish deli is good too. It smells fresh!  Was looking for some shitake mushrooms, green onions and seaweed. The aisles are a little disorganized but whatever.  Although there are so many noodle products, didn't find any ramen. I am not talking about the individual ramen packs. I mean actual ramen noodle products. They had 2 full aisles of noodles in bulk packages except ramen. Weird.  Overall, I like the store. Definitely a must to buy Asian groceries. Prices are good and huge selection.

This Hot Topic is better than a lot of other ones. It just seems cleaner and more organized. Ever since Star Wars and Avengers became huge, this store seems to have a lot of cool stuff in addition to your usual Doctor Who, anime and other random things. And there seems to be a sale every week. The clothes are pretty cool too if you are the type that doesn't shop at Old Navy or GAP or any place for the ordinary folks. This is a place for people with style. Or just a bunch of nerds.

This is a nice hotel. The room had such a good view of the fountain for... I forget the exact hotel. Caesar's palace? It's a big fountain. Bed was comfy, style was modern and it was just fancy. Or at least the room I was in was fancy. Compared to the other hotels around, I can tell there's a difference.  And the lower levels were quite nice with it's own restaurants, bars, clubs, etc. It's all in one place. If you can afford it, I would recommend this hotel because it will enhance your experience in Vegas.

The ramen here is absolutely horrible. I still come here because of 2 things. My friends like it here and it's really the only ramen place in the Tempe.  Bottom line, this place is for people that had never experienced excellent ramen other than the package ramen at the store. This place just puts a lot of sodium in your broth and then gives you hot sauce too to cover up the bland taste.   I have eaten ramen in Japan and California, and this place can't compare. But if YOU have never eaten authentic ramen bowls in Asia or California, then YOU may like this ramen. Oh... this place isn't even run by anyone that is Japanese. Contrary to what their shirts say, THEY DON"T KNOW RAMEN.  And the prices at actually kind of high for it's mediocre quality. If you are in AZ and want some authentic ramen, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. They are not a ramen restaurant but they do serve a couple of different ramen bowls. You'll notice the drastic difference.

What can I say? It's cheaper than Starbucks and you can buy delicious donuts for cheap. I came in here for a small coffee and a donut. I'll becoming back for cheap breakfast.  Because at Paradise Bakery next door, it cost like $9 for a breakfast sandwich! There goes that arm and a leg.

$1 subs on customer appreciation day once a year. It's a great deal! There are usually a lot of people in line but JJ prepares for that and you get in and out in about 15 minutes or less. That's pretty good when there are 30 orders in front of you.  I usually get the Vito because I like salami and the Italian meats. The taste of the subs have a little more flavor than Subway. Of course, you don't get to choose your veggies to put on there, but it tastes good and the service is super fast.  The chips aren't bad either. They have a good selection. Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more, this could be the place for you. Actually, it's probably the same price as Subway if you don't get Subway's $5 footlong deal. So either way, it just depends on what you like. But I can say that JJ tastes just a little better.

Car was cleaned.  But this place still deserved 1 star.  Here's the 3 reasons...  1. I called and said I wanted a certain part of the car cleaned and they quoted me a price. When I got there, the price was increased by $10 and the exact guy I talked to on the phone said he never remembered the phone call from 2 hours before.  2. They said they were going to do a certain type of cleaning. THEY DIDN'T DO IT. I asked them why they didn't do it and only used water and some spray, and the guy said oh we don't offer the service you requested.  3. Then everyone started hiding behind their Spanish language and suddenly didn't speak English and this other employee had to start translating for me. What just happened? I had questions about the situation and suddenly no one knows English.  So basically, they lied the entire time and faked the whole language barrier thing when I called them out on their deception. I should have just called INS instead and had them all deported.  BASICALLY, their excuse was the "car is clean..."   TRANSLATION: "We misquoted you on the price, offered a service that didn't exist because we don't have that specific equipment, and lied to you the entire time with a smile. But the car is clean! Just not the way you wanted it cleaned."  I can relate this to ordering a medium burger and the waitress comes out with a piece of charred burger and says, "hey you got what you ordered... a burger."  Yeah just stay away from this place. You can't trust these types of people if you know what I mean.

It's such a beautiful place. You are paying for the posh atmosphere but seriously, it's beautiful. You feel fancy just looking at it.  It's a nice place to chill if you can find room to sit. It seems like everyone wants to come here, but it's not like a club where someone is escorting you in? It's a lounge so lounge around! The drinks are pricey and can add up quick. The Long Island is a good choice for the amount of alcohol you get.  Overall, good place.

Probably your best bet for Asian karaoke! The only other places I knew that had private rooms were Korean BBQ and Saketini, and I heard Saketini doesn't do the private room karaoke anymore. Who knows... they may bring it back!   But as for August, it's pretty nice. It's also pricey if you don't have a large group to divide the hourly cost! The setup is nice. Each group as their own room. You can even rent the large open area in the middle of the place. I do like how the song selection is all digital and has nice pictures of artists on it. It's very modern app setup. The rooms can fit up to 20 people it seems, and you can bring your own drinks and food.  Selections of songs range from Thai to Korean to Japanese to American songs... a little something for everyone! And it even has some pretty recent songs. I think the best part of the digital interface is that you can choose five to six different ways to find a song. Genre, artist, language, title, top hits, etc.   If you have a large group that wants to sing privately, this is the place. Of course don't make it too large because then you would only get to sing one to two songs every hour.

This place is awesome. I always order here when I get the chance.  I think my favorite has to be the sweet and sour pork... and the mongolian beef.  Wait, I changed my mind. The katsu chicken and teriyaki chicken was AMAZING. Yep, those are my favorites. haha!  The portions are good. It does taste more authentic than some of the Chinese places around the area. And the fact that it's Chinese people that own the place kind of confirms it.  Good place for lunch. They also have some Korean and Japanese and Hawaiian style food here too!

Perfect date place. The atmosphere and the friendly staff. The Vietnamese coffee flavor was great too. I got it in a waffle cone and then we just chilled out back in the patio while eating it. There were also toppings you can add on there too. Great ice cream place! Sometimes, it's too great and the line is long but it's worth it.

It wasn't too bad but the area is really sketchy. Good thing it was for one night.  I expected rude staff but they were ok because we checked in late at night. I guess that's a good way to avoid rude staff from what I read in other reviews.  I would go down a mile or two and stay in actual downtown Mesa where it's nicer.

What impressed me was the toppings at this place. They had the mango, peach, blue berry and apple boba bubbles. I just happened to love boba bubbles. The other yogurt place only have mango. The flavors are pretty much the same as the other yogurt places like Zoyo and Mojo and etc. Except for Yogurtland because Yogurtland have like 15 flavors in stock at all times with new seasonal flavors every month.  The place was clean however, the sample cups are not easily accessible. You have to ask the clerk and the clerk goes and pours a sample for you. It felt a little stingy for a place that is supposed to be fancy and all. But whatever, I just used the same sample cup to try other flavors.  So if you are in Fashion Square and in the mood for Yogurt, this place is the place to go. Actually, I think this is the only yogurt place in the mall. Unless you want to walk across the street. There's a Yogurtland on the NE corner of Scottsdale and Camelback. :)

Happy hour is awesome here. The ambience is pretty nice too with plenty of light and a crisp freshness to the place. You can spend a couple of hours here relaxing, eating and drinking while chatting with friends.   The best thing during happy hour is the board which consists a variety of things from prosciutto to jam to bread at a lower price. That will fill you up. I also had the personal pizza special for the day. Couldn't finish it because of all the food. The vanilla vodka drink was decent.   So either the board or the pizza will decently fill you up. And probably a mimosa will top off a good experience. About $15 for that during happy hour. Although I didn't mention it yet... The food is really delicious. :)

The place was ok. Wasn't too sure about the burgers since it seemed like it was really thin and over fried. The taste is unique so I guess it is a good thing if you are into that. I prefer thicker patties.  A little pricey... not as good as In N Out in my opinion. And for the price, also not as good as Steak N Shake (which comes with fries with your order) for the same price.

The overall place I like. It had a little of everything. You had decent pho, decent drinks, decent service, random karaoke and live bands, sushi being available and the greatest thing, BEING OPEN UNTIL 2AM.   Sometimes, it's a good place to hang out that serve Asian food during the night. I can't think of any other place being open that late and not being a total "bar" or "club" like atmosphere. This place is chill and relaxed but can get quite loud with the music.  Come in and order a drink appetizer or pho late at night. Watch some sports or watch some bands or watch people doing karaoke.  The service is spotty because of the relaxed atmosphere. So watch out! But it's really nothing to complain about. This is definitely a good late night choice for food and alcohol. ;)

Come here if you want to buy a giant rice crispie treat for $22. REALLY? This place is more like a novelty gift shop than a candy store.  This is place is hazardous to your health and at the same time, you will pay more money than just going to Walmart and gorging on their cheaper candy.  It's a colorful and trendy atmosphere... that might make it a fun visual journey to diabetes.

I'm a fan because this place is 24 hours and I may need a place to loiter at 3am. If I decide to hang out like a bum, I can get some donuts and boba drinks if I want.  Donuts and Boba drinks are OK decent to below average. Not the best. But 24 HOURS! You can stuff your face at 4am if you want to.

Big selection of beers. They also have a small mix drinks menu as well. Didn't realize it until a few days ago but they also serve food? Not sure if it's good or not. Didn't want to pay for overpriced food if it's going to be bad.  The white chocolate and the Hava beer with blueberries was good!  I say come in a small group because it's true what they say about the place being small. And eat first because the food here is unknown variable. Who knows if it's good or bad. And then you'll be out some money too that could have been spent on beer.

I love this place. It's probably the best thing that has happened to an airport. Just imagine a great place for food, not expensive, and inside an airport... Usually, you have these chains and generic restaurants in there but not at Sky Harbor. There's an LGO.  There's already an LGO "intersection" in Phoenix with the pizzeria, bakery, burger place and grocery. The food is great there. I compared the prices at the airport with the regular prices and they were the same! You would figured that you would get charged an arm and a leg because it's inside an airport. But no... great food, same price.  I love the English muffins, the Kale salad and pizza. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is good too. So if you are in Terminal 4 flying Southwest, you can head toward Gates C-D and grab some good food. It's worth the walk... or a ride on the moving walkway. You'll get there in like 2 minutes!  The food is really good, the price is fair, the staff is great, and you have a HUGE variety of items to choose from on the menu. Sandwiches, pastries, pizza, salad, soup, etc. Go try it out next time, and then go to the regular LGO location too. You'll love that you did. :)

I have eaten at a lot of pho places. This place, it was below average. The broth was weak and the meat was so chewy. As in you couldn't chew it apart. Combine that with $9 pho, wilted basil and uncomfortable chairs, it's not worth it.  I didn't get a chance to try the French portion of the menu. But pho is pretty simple and if you can't get that right, why would I try the more expensive portion of your menu.  Want real pho? Go to an authentic pho restaurant. Just sayin'.

Best burger I have ever had. Hands down! The farm burger. The flavor was absolutely incredible where you can taste more than just the meat and cheese and bun. There was something to it that was unique. Truffle fries were also amazing with the aioli sauce.  You can tell that a chef's planning and skill has gone into the food at this restaurant. Like a really good chef so definitely a place to go and try! The atmosphere was pretty nice too, and the service was decent.   Oh and the prices were pretty decent. Next time, I'll try the other burgers.

Ate a few hotdogs from this location. Same as the one in Tempe. So that's good!  Amazing menu with Chicago style food. The service is decently fast but I think it's the taste that matters at Portillos. Still haven't tried the entire menu. I have tried hotdogs, tamales, and sausages. Still debating if I want to try their salads and fancy burgers. Somehow, I associate this place with hotdogs.  Anyway, it's not healthy. At least the hotdogs and sausages but extremely delicious! If you are looking for fast food, this is the place. Skip the other chains.

They were giving away free pull pork sandwiches. The sandwich was decent. The happy hour prices were not bad either but food selection was bland. The waitress didn't seem happy. If you are down for a cowboy theme place, then you may want to stop on by. It had picnic tables that you would see at a park or something.  Other than that, there are better places on Mill Ave.

The ramen expert in me wants to cringe when I eat the ramen. LOL But I also know that I'm not in Japan or California, and this is probably better than most ramen places in Tempe.  Well, it's better than Republic Ramen... if that is saying much? However, it's probably from the same people of Republic Ramen. The broth, the menu and the style is just too similar. And it's just as expensive. I ordered the ramen.... no toppings and it was $8. Additional toppings are at least $1 per topping, and that is ridiculous.  I don't know where these guys learned to make ramen but please.... no more spinach. It ruins the texture and flavor of the broth. I don't even want to ask why there is corn available as a topping. I'll just get annoyed. -______-  Better off going back to Cherry Blossoms for their ramen (which actually tastes like Japanese ramen).

Limited selection. For once, I'm wondering where is the Starbucks. I should have walked down to the other gate of the terminal to the closest Starbucks.. When I asked the worker about the selection of pastries, she had no idea what the names are. Or the prices.  They do have some hot steamy items for sale around $9 hot sandwiches but for that price, LGO would be a better choice around the corner with a wider selection of tasty food.  Just a generic coffee place. Walk 500 feet down the terminal to Starbucks for coffee. Walk 20 feet to LGO for food. I think LGO might have coffee too. Actually, just don't go to this place.  Oh yeah, pastry wasn't that good and coffee was meh..

Good varieties of boba drinks. And they serve other desserts or snacks too. There are drinks here that I haven't seen anywhere else. The decor is pretty inviting and you can hang out with your friends in this bright color place and drinking boba.  They also have other toppings besides boba. I had the grass jelly coconut ice tea and that was pretty good. There are enough options to keep you coming back to try more. What's best is that it's in Mekong and you can come here after lunch or dinner for a relaxing time.  Or buy a drink for the road.

Amazing event for any sweets lover. When I first walked in, there was a gelato station with mint chocolate, greek yogurt, peach and chocolate flavors. I thought the mint was the best and it had actual mint in the gelato. The peach was also very good and I was told that it was made from fresh peaches.  After gelato tasting, I walked into the back and was greeted by tables of sweets. There were cupcakes of all flavors, cakes, cookies, etc. And all of that served with champagne! In addition, you can see the bakers baking some fresh English muffins for us. Those muffins were huge, fresh and extra soft. One of my favorites was the dumpling pastry which looked like a huge muffin. Upon eating it, it was more like a croissant with jam filling in muffin form... if that makes sense. It was topped with powder sugar and almonds.  We were in the very spot where all the sweets are made so it was very cool to get a glimpse of the baking area. The staff was so nice and everything looked amazing. If you look at the pictures, the food was beautiful. This was a dessert paradise. Too bad I can't eat all that sugar in a two hour span.  The event was awesome and thanks to Lindsey for setting it up. Thanks to LGO staff for the delicious food. I'm so glad I learned of the LGO Bake Shop. I would definitely recommend this place!

Sandwiches are delicious! It's toasted and the the tastes really get to you especially with the meats they use. I guess you can say that it's a little fancier version of other sandwich shops.   I prefer the Italian or the Wreck (which is like Italian except it has roast beef)  Other items on the menu looks really tasty too!

Down to the facts.  1. After 30 min, they said they were out of brats to a few people at our table and had them re-order. 2. Their new order came out before our original order 3. Turns out they weren't out of brats later on. 4. Then finally everyone's food came out. 5. 1 and a half hours from sit down to actually getting our food.  Meanwhile, a bunch staff stood in the front chatting the entire time.

Because of an unfortunate incident, the other location was permanently closed. I don't know if this place is a reopened version or just happens to be another location chain. But it gets 5 stars for the delicious food and the cheap price!  The extra large bowl is $7. Seriously? That's cheap. The regular bowls are $5.50+. Usually, pho places are $8 or more so you can see why this is awesome. Plus, their broth is full of flavor. One thing you should try is the stew #7 because it is packed with meat. The pho that I get is packed with meat. None of this 3 pieces of meat crap from the other restaurants. I still had meat in my bowl at the end of the meal. The amounts are generous which is another reason for the 5 stars.  Appetizers are cheap too. Cheaper than a lot of places where they charge you like $5 for spring rolls. Here... $2. Yeah...   I don't know about the service cuz I'm not really high maintenance but their service is ok. And the restaurant is medium clean. Oh well. I just came here for the awesome pho, anyway.

This place looks nice. ;) From lights to the fireplace to the atmosphere... the details were amazing. The staff was on point taking care of everyone and the entire event went off without a problem. At least no problems that I know since I wasn't part of the planning party. Which is good! Highly recommended.

Good times! It's always amazing when you get to try out a new menu before it gets served to the public. And hanging out with all the Yelp elites wasn't too bad either. I loved playing the bingo game and getting to know other Yelpers. Sometimes, we tend to just stay and socialize with the people we know.  The food was delicious! The artichoke flat bread with chicken was amazing. So was the nachos and fried mushrooms. I think Outback did an amazing job with their new menu. A lot of the items are only $4. My Coast Rita drink was amazing as well. They even put their Blooming Onion dish onto the new menu as a $4 item, and that's one of my favorite appetizers from Outback. It's a smaller size but it's only $4! Other notable items were the Aussie Rum punch and the coconut shrimp. So this is an all day menu meaning these prices and items are available everyday at anytime across the entire country. So I was told that... except in California. California is special, I guess. haha.  Staff was friendly and worked very hard. Thanks to Lindsey for setting this up and inviting us out. And also the new Yelp intern person helping out Lindsey. I think her name was Jessica. I don't know... I'm sure I'll be seeing her around more anyways.

MENS SECTION  The clothes here are nice! They may be a little pricey but the fit is nice. Well, when I say pricey, it's still comparable to Express and all the other stores. But what I noticed is that the men's section has clothes that are slim fit. Very good for skinny Asian men.  I noticed the designs are more complex and better than the usual American styles too. I guess that's what I see a lot of Asian people in this store. haha. There are jackets, dress pants, suits, casual wear, rock wear and lot of different things that go very well together.  This is the closest I have seen to Asian style modern clothing in AZ in a long time. It's practically Korean style!  WOMENS SECTION  Everything in the women's section was also very stylish.

I always like this event. The only problem is that I eat too much and three things happen: 1) My stomach hurts like halfway through the event 2) By having so much food in me, I can't drink that much 3) If I do drink, I can't get drunk. #FoodieProblems  Yes, I did a hashtag! Anyway, the event is a FANCY event. I really like fancy event. It's just the atmosphere and being at the Biltmore Resort, fancy is the norm. I haven't seen so many women in black mini-skirts all in one place. I guess you can count that as a plus for the event too. A lot of the servers were in costumes so that was awesome! Two waitresses were just painted in gold and wearing heels and a thong. They were very popular that night.  I'm glad I got to eat a lot of food. I was questioning if $35 was worth it. But I guess it paid for my drinks, my food and the atmosphere. I ate so much I can't even remember what I ate. The yellow curry from Thai Elephant was good! There were duck sliders, lamb sliders, dates stuffed with chorizo wrapped in bacon crab cakes, chicken, bbq ribs, steak, pork belly, tamales, cheese, salami, pulled pork, mac and cheese, veggies, desserts, cupcakes and some things that I didn't even get a chance to try. Of course, the open bar was cool too! Beer or mixed cocktails.  The weird thing was... why were there non-restaurant tables in there? Like Gold's Gym and a costume booth. There were others too. I expect tables to be serving food because it's a food event. I can't eat a gym membership. I can't drink a costume.  If you go, I do give you a warning. Go early. Food does run out. And alcohol does run out. They ran out of whiskey half way through the night. For the ladies, wear comfortable shoes. A lot of girls' feet were hurting.

Good family fun because it has a lot of variety. There's video games, billiards, laser tag, bowling, climbing bridge, restaurant and random things. All of the kids seem to have fun.   Look for specials. On a Monday last week, it was $10 all you can bowl, laser tag, etc.   Oh and you also get waiter service while you bowl. It's kind of cool since you don't have to leave your lane and the waiter brings you food and drinks.  Good family fun OR good group hang out with friends too!

Always loved Chik Fil A but their locations were sparce. Good to have one here by ASU. The store looks really nice and modern!  Got some mailings in the mail for free breakfast sandwich and I came to check it out. It was awesome. Chicken was crispy and tender and the English muffin they used as a bun was so soft.   If you like Chik Fil A, well, there's another location for you. Enjoy!

I like this location better than the Mesa one. It seems more inviting and well lit. I sat outside in the patio and it was pretty great. Happy hour was on and it was a perfect night with beer and a pasty talking with friends.  There's a good variety of pasties and alcohol. As for the pasties, you probably won't find this food at most restaurants here in the valley.  I also like that this place is on Goldwater so it's not all caught up in the crowd of main street Old Town. :)

Too bad it's not 24 hours. They should make it that way like the other location.  Well, this location seems more decorated or at least better than the other locations. I like how it's more clean and whatnot. Awesome drinks and donuts here. You can get donut holes too and I think I saw sandwich menu on the board.  Good place to hang out with free wifi. Grab donuts and drinks if you get hungry. Although the other thing is I notice a lot of random homeless people around or that comes onto the patio to ask for money or cigarettes.  Other than that, it's a pretty decent location if you just need a drink and a donut.

I love the food here. Haven't had a disappointing dish yet!  I usually go with the Texas burger because that is consistently good. Along with their fries and outdoor patio, it is an awesome experience. I also had the pleasure of ordering egg salad on their English muffins which is probably the best item on their menu. Too bad they only serve it for an hour each day. So you gotta get there at a specific time.  Nice waitresses and they do a lot to make sure you are having a great meal. Totally recommend this place for it's quiet neighborhood, great food and the convenience of going across the street for dessert and drinks at the market and bakery... who is also own by the same company.

I like this place. The only other place I been to is Pizza Studio in downtown Phoenix. Although I think the pizza is a little smaller, it's also cooked in a different way. Instead of a conveyor belt oven, it's actually a fire oven. Extra crispy though and different texture.   The taste is pretty good and on par with Pizza studio. I think there may be more ingredients here, but I couldn't put as much ingredients on because of the smaller size. What's impressive was that the pizza cooked in 2 minutes as opposed to 5-10 minutes at Pizza Studio.  Well, the prices are about the same so I guess either place would be fine. I think there are more Fired Pie places and only one Pizza Studio in Phoenix area. So like both places, I give them 4 stars for fast delicious unlimited toppings pizza!

It's a nice little place in Heritage Square. Seems a little pricey for me but it's convenient. Doesn't fit too many people in it but I guess you can get your coffee to go and walk around. Coffee is good though. You'll enjoy. :)

My friend eats here like almost everyday. Got me to eat some sandwiches here too and I gotta say, it's delicious. I think a lot of people think it's delicious too since this place has a 5 STAR rating. haha.  When I was there last time, there were about 20-30 people waiting in line to order sandwiches. And they were willing to wait too. I don't know but the flavor, sauce and texture of the sandwiches are just so GOOD. The sandwiches are huge too! It's probably going to cost you a little more than sandwiches from Subway, PotBelly, Capriotti's, etc.  There's a whole lot of different sandwiches you can order (even vegetarian and gluten free) written on the chalkboard but make sure you get the Dutch Crunch bread. It's really good with a certain crunch to it. I guess you can visit their website for every item on the menu. Oh they give you a caramel apple lollipop too with your sandwich to cleanse your palette. :)  Usually, if you come during non-rush hour times, you don't have to wait in line!

I got the bulgogi stone dish for $15. It was basically a bibimbap with meat. It was very big. And I mean it was very big! I thought it was pretty good the flavors were fine. It came out sizzling hot, and I broke the egg yoke and mix everything together with sauce. Tasted fantastic and it seemed very authentic. They also serve sushi but I didn't try any of that. My friends try the other dishes including the pork belly and the other bulgogi plates and some tofu soup. They didn't complain about it and it seemed they enjoyed it a lot.  The staff was friendly and was very attentive. I like how they were really familiar with their dishes and that they were constantly coming by to check if it tasted good or not. In the background they played some Korean pop music which was pleasing.   So now I have 4 Korean places that I will eat at. :-)

The happy hour was good on the drinks and appetizers for $3. And during happy hour, the boneless wings were 60 cents. But that's probably the highlight of the place when it came to wings!  The rest of the wings were pricey. Around $6 for 5 wings? Really? Yes I know you have sauces (let me tell it's pretty mediocre) and you have the giant TVs but I can't really seeing myself paying for that much for wings.  I would go there for the $3 menu and 60 cent boneless if you are into the boneless stuff. Go somewhere else for tastier and cheaper wings.

First time I had Pizza Studio was in LA. And I loved it. $7.99 for unlimited toppings is just a great deal especially when you put everything on your pizza. Which I do... and it's a heavy pizza.  Basically, it's like Subway of pizzas. You are at the counter and you just tell them what to put on it. The sauce, the meats, the veges, the whatever. You can even put two layers of meat on it or put the 5-6 different kinds of meat on it altogether. I basically had a chicken, sausage, bacon, ham, salami, pepperoni, sweet sausage, (insert all available veges toppings), goat cheese, feta cheese and parm cheese with pesto sauce on flax seed whole grain crust. It was massively epic.  I'm glad they opened one here because I swear I was not aware they had on in downtown Phoenix. Now this will be my Go To place for food if I'm ever in downtown. Why spend a lot of money when you can spend $7.99!!!  One thing weird that happened was they gave my pizza to someone else so I had to get back in line to remake it. So make sure you be on the look out for your pizza when they call out your name! It will save you the time and hassle.

Going here twice in a week is what I call worth it!!! As in $11.99 to eat all the sushi you want during lunch from 11am to 4pm. I mean seriously, if you are planning to spend more than $12 for sushi, you need to come here. It is definitely a "Your money's worth" situation! Two specialty rolls at other restaurants cost more than this.  It's all you can eat on anything from appetizers such as shrimp tempura, seaweed salad to dessert such as fried bananas and green tea ice cream. You also have chicken, beef, salmon cutlet, ramen, udon, maki rolls, hand rolls, nigiri pieces and so on. The drinks do cost extra money though. I usually stick with water.  The pieces are decently made and they are not overstuffed with rice. I'm glad the owners are respecting the customers in that regard. The fish is decently fresh as well. So for moderate pricing and decent sushi that is way worth your money, you need to come to Akita.  I think I ate about 30-40 pieces of sushi every time I went not including the seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, miso soup, friend bananas and other random things. You can also order their specialty rolls which include Las Vegas, Manhattan, Rainbow and 3 other specialty rolls. Usually I always eat about 6-10 salmon nigiri pieces first because salmon is just that good. :)  This place is awesome, but it could use more than 2 waitress since everything is made to order (not buffet style) and then brought to your table. I also had several instances where they just forgot what I ordered and didn't bring it. Or they got the order itself wrong on certain sushi pieces. They could put more specialty rolls on their menu too.

The food tastes like authentic Chinese food. And the service is better than the usual authentic Chinese places. Prices are getting up there by a dollar, and the food portions are not as big as other places.  Maybe it's a "better service" at the expense of "big food portions." I don't know... I probably take more food over service. Just saying as an Asian person. haha.  This was during dinner and the place had a lot of people so that's always a good sign. The menu had some good varieties too. And like I said, it's authentic taste. Unless you get something that's specifically made for Americans. Then you get authentic American taste.

Wayne's World! Party on! Shwing!!!  Awesome Tuesday night with Wayne's World movie at FilmBar, drinking the tasty beer, and hot dogs from Short Leash. That sample jalapeno pepper popper deep fried was pretty tasty too!  So it seems we are gonna watch a lot of movies that were made in Arizona. Sounds like a good time! Let's bring on the dogs and beer again!  Thanks to FilmBar for hosting, Short Leash for dishing out the food, and Lindsey for putting it together. She is the glue that binds us all! Haha. Woot woot!

This is a nice very lit boba place. I tried their Taro coconut milk tea and it didn't disappoint. They had so many flavors that it was hard to choose. From what I tasted, it was not too sweet which is good. I've had boba where it was almost pure sugar and the texture wasn't right.   Their cups are a little different and possibly bigger than normal cups which you will see in the price increase. They are basically wider and fatter than a normal cup. It's almost like a bowl. A medium will run you almost $6.   It was fast and friendly and clean. So no complaints here! Come drinks some tea and watch Korean drama on the HD TV.... with no subtitles so you won't know what's going on. But hey! Everyone on the shows are extremely pretty so dialogue is not needed. Haha.

There are two Mexican sushi places I want to try and this was one of them. The decor inside the restaurant seems nice and our waitress was punctual. We ordered the Mexican roll, Milena roll and some calamari tempura.  The calamari was ok. The Milena roll and Mexican roll were really good. The Mexican roll has some spice to it. The Milena roll was very filling because first, it was breaded and deep fried. Second, it had avocado, bacon, chicken and shrimp among other vegetables. I loved the sauce. It was a tangy spicy mayo.  The price is above $10 for each roll so be prepared for that. I will try the other place soon and see how that goes as well. But for now, if you are in West Gate area and want some Mexican sushi, head on over there. Or traditional sushi rolls... we didn't order those, but they are also there if you want to order them.

Good sandwiches. Certainly more flavor and uniqueness than your average Subway. I suggest going with the Dutch Crunch bread. And it has happy hour which is free drinks and chips from 4pm-7pm. As for the types of sandwiches, there are a lot of variety.  I had the pastrami which is not bad at all. I still could say that it could have used a little more meat. But other than that, it was good. The fries were good too but not sure if it was $5 worth of good. I mean that is almost another sandwich right there. Or extra meat.  Is it the best? I can't say that. Is it good? Yes.

Not sure if this is the same one I go to that's on Country Club and Baseline. But that one is not on Yelp. Oh well. This place is like Costco without the membership.  The Good: Prices are cheap. You can almost buy in bulk. What I mean is there are lots of cheap items. There are other items that are in giant bins. You scoop them into a bag and weigh them and that determines your price.  The Bad: items and prices change all of the time. I think it's just what they can get their hands on. And no it's not costco or any other stores. You barely see any employees and things are basic to the bone. Freshness of the food is also questionable too.  Overall, it's a money saver!  Oh yeah, no credit cards accepted. Come with cash or debit.

Finally, some place to eat a snack at in downtown Mesa. This place is usually busy when there's an event in downtown. It's obvious. At night, it's like one of the only hang out places opened unless you want to spend your time in a coffee shop or a restaurant or a bar.  When it comes to downtown, good places are lacking. And this place definitely adds to downtown. And who doesn't like ice cream sandwich between two cookies? Or sandwiched between two brownies?  Food is good and cheap and fast service. :)

The place is gorgeous and super fancy looking. When we walked into the background, impressive was the first word that came to mind. We had an entire setup to mix drinks in front of us to glasses, squeezers, stirrers, syrups, gin, etc., but first they told us to grab appetizers. The sandwiches were delicious. I really loved the smoked salmon and chicken sandwiches. The tomato and fig bruschetta were pretty good too. We were served a gin and tonic with cucumber spear to begin.   As we were munching down, Mix Master Mark gave us a presentation on Hendrick's Gin. And then taught us how to make drinks.  We made a lemonade gin drink which was delicious. Didn't know you can make a lemonade drink with gin. Then it was a blueberry green tea drink. Everyone at our table got to make their own and had a lot of fun talking and drinking. Then Mark did another presentation for us and taught us how to make punch for a party using Hendrick's gin. It was delicious! Cinnamon punch tastes great!  It was a classy event and everyone had a good time. The servers were great bringing us fresh ice and toppings and whatever we needed. Thanks to them for helping out! And thanks to Mix Master Mark for such an entertaining presentation and instructions. It was a great time and I know everyone appreciates it. Too much alcohol for us to drink in the end because we made a huge bowl of punch!

The hotdogs are delicious! Comes with all the fixings like relish, tomatoes, pickles, pepper, etc. You can also get the polish sausage Chicago style too! Basically, it replaces the hotdog with a sausage. I just eat everything altogether... even the long pickle. Trust me, it's more delicious that way.  I can see why this place is packed. There are lines and it may seem crowded at times, but it's pretty quick to place an order and get your food.  The tamale was also piping hot and very delicious. Loved it. Didn't expect this place to serve it but it does. And it's pretty cheap.  The burger was ok. Just your normal burger. I mean, this is a hotdog place, in my opinion. So order hotdogs. I haven't tried the salads yet but very soon, I will!

Maybe it was just the word Gangnam made me want to come here because it reminded me of that song. So this place is a Japanese/Korean restaurant. I heard the sushi was good and the Korean food was good so I tried it. I liked it. I will have to say that the Korean stuff is more the pricey side while the Japanese food is about what you would find elsewhere.  I ordered sushi and Korean food. The sushi was good. The Korean tofu soup was even better. It had a lot of flavor and way more than the usual ones I find at other Korean restaurant. One thing about the staff is that they are so happy. Why are they so happy? I don't know. But they were happy and enthusiastic. If only they weren't so new and forgetful of things that you request.  Well food and service was good and the decor was very intimate so I say it's good place to bring friends and dates! There's very few Korean places in Tempe so this place is definitely a plus to the area.

SuperDry is like American Eagle. Except from Japan. So I guess we can call it Japan Eagle if we wanted to but I don't think a Japan eagle specifically exists. What I mean is it looks like American Eagle apparel. The vibrant color, the shirts and the style. And the sizes are better fitting too.  Instead of American Eagle, it says SuperDry with kanji (those Asian symbols) on their clothing. What I do like about SuperDry is that their jackets and accessories such as bags are super cool. That's what I see and would say... that is SuperDry style. Good brand, maybe a little pricey but overall, great quality.  This store is quite nice and clean. I suggest visiting it.

There's just so many toppings for me to choose and the dressing is just so delicious. What really gets me is the Maine Root soda. Absolutely better than Coke or Pepsi products.   I usually like to get the large salad, and to me, the Cobb and Don Quixote are one of the better ones. Although the Crazy Ivan also is up there. The place is pretty modern and clean. You just walk up and they make the salad right in front of you. I highly suggest ordering some of the olives because they bring out some intense flavors of other toppings and the salad.  Usually not a fan of $10+ salads but I might make an exception. Also, I suggest not doing take out because those bowls are smaller than the eat-in bowls mainly because they have to close the take out bowls with a lid. With the normal bowls, the salad can be piled on into a mountain shape. That means more salad!

Definitely experienced better. I would say this festival is worth going is if you were living nearby and you had NOTHING better to do and wanted to pay for some overpriced small portioned food. And as one of the "judges" for this festival, I had no information. I had to call the person coordinating the judges to get directions and instructions when I arrived on site. And then spent a long time waiting for someone to come give further instructions.   They wanted us to grab 1 sample, walk back to get recorded while eating, and then repeat the process. Of course, it didn't work because it was pretty hard getting samples in the first place. We didn't want to spend 5-10 minutes finding a vendor that gave samples, spending 5 minutes in line, and getting a bite sized sample to walk another 2 minutes back to the cameras.  I'll just bullet point the things that went wrong overall.  1. The different VIP, sample, regular lines didn't matter. Vendors decided to follow them at their own will. 2. Shortage of food. 3. Shortage of utensils. 4. Shortage of water. 5. Over priced items for sale were small. 6. Sample tickets were overpriced for bite sized portions. 7. Not all vendors participated in the sample activities. 8. The layout was terrible and was constantly overcrowded in certain areas. 9. Staff has no idea what's going besides their very own specific jobs. And sometimes they didn't even know their own specific jobs that well. 10. And lastly, read all the other reviews about the bad things. I can't spend an entire day listing them.

I had to try it out cuz you know... it says ramen expert on my profile. From Japan to California to Tempe, I am here to see who makes good ramen! I was super excited about this ramen place because everything looked like a ramen place in California. Just from the pictures I have seen, it looked more authentic than all of the ramen places in Arizona... including Fujiya Market.  I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen without the extra flavor. The broth was not as thick or creamy as I expected. That is really the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars (and the fact that the waitress forgot my order... twice). It was the criteria that would have matched it with the awesome ramen shops in California and Japan. Next, it was trying it with the extra flavor that costs an extra dollar. And to my disappointment, it didn't really had any depth to it. It just tasted like it had more sodium in the broth. Although, I do recommend the extra flavor because the regular flavor was kind of weak since it's missing the flavor from the creamy and thick texture and the pork fat that's supposed to be floating on top of a tonkatsu broth.  No doubt, the ramen is still better than Umami and the forsaken place called Ramen Republic. I think Posh in Scottsdale is a little better but it's way more expensive. So I think Tampopo is a good compromise on flavor vs price with the available options here in AZ.  On a final note, THE TAKOYAKI IS AWESOME! Tastes good, authentic and full of actual octopus. Just like the ones in Japan and California. I was pleasantly surprised. It beats the ones being served at the Japanese Matsuri that were more expensive and had octopus "paste" in it.  I just might come here for the takoyaki instead of the ramen. Tampopo... your takoyaki destination. LOL

It seems like ramen places are popping up all over Phoenix area. So far, all but two restaurants have failed to meet the standard of decent ramen in AZ. I just want more places that meet the standard to be in AZ so I don't have to drive so far for good ramen... I'm not even talking about being as good as California or Japan which have top tier awesome ramen. Anyway, it's all about the broth and noodles. I'm just going to be ramen expert here (it says so on my profile) for a second and judge the tonkatsu ramen bowl I had.  I appreciate that the egg was not hard boiled. So I'm glad they got that right. It wasn't running gooey soft (best kind) but at least it was semi-gooey. Another thing that I appreciate is that there were THREE pieces of pork in the ramen, and they weren't skimping on the meat like some of the other places. Might I add... the pork melts in your mouth.  Onto the broth! The broth is primarily the main component I judge when I eat ramen. Is it creamy? Is it thick? Does it have pork fat on top? Does it show depth? Can I taste the depth? So first, I would like to say that it meets the standards of good tonkatsu broth. If there was a minimum standard, it meets it! :) It's not the best when comparing to Japan or even California, but it is way above anything else in Arizona. It has flavor, a level depth and a texture consistent to good tonkatsu broth. (if broth can have texture hahaha). Sadly, no pork fat driplets floating on top of the broth. :(  The noodles were not soggy even to the end of the bowl. SOGGY NOODLES ARE BAD! So I'm glad the noodles didn't loose their structure. With that said, I'm not familiar with the noodles. I have gone through a lot of ramen noodle types but never came across this one. It is a hybrid between Lo Mein and Soba noodles. It didn't taste bad or anything. It was just different... (I seriously think it's thick buckwheat soba noodles).  With that said, I still think this beats all other ramen in the valley in terms of overall quality, toppings and broth even if it has the questionable noodles. There is a minimum standard and it's been met. The service was decent. Food came out pretty fast and the servers were nice. We also had the takoyaki (it was all right) and the fried tofu (tasted good, but more soft than fried). This place has potential to be top tier. I'll have to try the other ramen bowls to confirm that it can be top tier and potentially the best in the valley. So far... at least the tonkatsu is beating every other ramen shop in Arizona.  Actually, I am waiting for the tsukemen ramen which is not available yet in the restaurant. I don't think any other ramen or Japanese restaurant serve tsukemen ramen in AZ either. If they can impress me with that, I'll change my review to 5 stars. ;)

The food was very visually appealing! The pepper shrimp was the best! If you are into spicy things, then you come to the right place. I think most if not all of the food items had spice in it. We had a giant list of dishes that were to come out and we sampled a lot. So much that we couldn't eat all of the food. From baby corn to chicken to curry to fried rice and noodles. Their cocktails were unique as well. One was sweet and the other spicy. In addition, I really love their juices. The lychee flavor and guava flavor really hit the spot to quiet down all of that spice. Chinese meal usually contains multiple items. Putting the yellow curry on the fried rice and noodles and then the chicken on top of it was very delicious. The mix of flavors really balanced bringing down the spice, enhancing the curry and allow the rice and noodles to have more flavor. It was great!  The crowd wasn't too big and we got to sit and chat and meet new people. Hi, Tina and Lavinia, etc. :) We even took a group picture outside. Thanks to the staff too! They were great. They refilled our water and had our food ready. At the end, the friend noodles and ice cream really hit the spot. Thanks to Hailey for such a great event and always being so cheerful and welcoming!
