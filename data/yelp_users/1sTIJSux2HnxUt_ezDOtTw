Came here for an oil change after making an appointment online. Took almost an hour and a half for it to get done, however without me saying a single word to them or complaint the guy who had me sign the initial paperwork walked in and said "sorry it took so long, there's no charge" and I was on my way...WOW..I was going to pay and just cut my time as a loss because shit happens. They made it right and I didn't even complain once about a single thing, just waited patiently.

Five stars due to this being the best Panda Express I've ever visited. The girl behind the counter was polite to the person in front of me OFFERING samples to them. When I stepped up she was super polite to me and offered me samples as well, and thanks to the sample I ended up getting the honey sesame seed chicken. Absolutely delicious. I asked for both noodles and rice and I expected the usual half-assed scoops of both but this girl hooked it up big time on everything! Despite all these bad reviews I will definitely be a repeat customer!

This place is a joke. The employees are slow as can be, they f*ck the portions up, they look at you like you're an idiot when you are ordering. I wouldn't give this place another shot unless someone else was paying for it. I feel this place should be shut down and a Filibertos or something of that nature should open up in its place. Hell I will just go to the Taco Bell that's in the same parking lot.   The one star is because they had air conditioning.  Manager should be fired.

Extremely nice Asian lady behind the counter. The honey mustard chicken was phenomenal!

Bring back the paper to fill out your own order, instead of having the waitress write down.

I only went to the target here. Shopping center appeared to be huge.

This chase is stupid as hell now, when did it get renovated and remove all of the tellers and replace it with two stupidly large iPhone-looking "ATMs" god forbid people have jobs. One star for the drive thru ATM (and because I can't give it zero)

For it being a complete ghost town with no customers there the wait was absolutely horrendous, the one star is for the car wash

This particular experience is a 5 star experience. This was my first time ever eating at Firehouse Subs. The people were extremely polite, the food came out fast, the Italian sub my girlfriend got was delicious (I had a bite) and my meatball sub was phenomenal. The soda machine was a super nice addition, the restaurant was clean and well kept. Our food was brought to us and the girl came and took our trays and trash from me before I had a chance to get up. Ill definitely be back!

EDIT: 2 stars instead of 3, waiting FOREVER STILL.  First time here was awesome this time around service started great, the server disappeared. Then sat without a drink and my food sitting on the table waiting for a box..so far I'm still waiting...love the food and the atmosphere but not so much the service.

Back again, (two days ago) came here for my Birthday (november) and everything seemed fine, I'm starting to think its only the patio employees who are odd. (Being that we sat outside this time) Love this place and one of the managers who saw my last review reached out to me to try to make things right. I would like to give big props to Stuart for caring.  To start this experience off:  Sign read something along the lines of wait to be seated so we stood for about 30 seconds before a guy walking by said "uhhhh you guys doin alright?" Then said its open seating. We head to the patio.  The waitress came soon enough, then said "want a beer menu?" We obliged and she came to take our order quickly. She seems nice enough just ditzy, we ordered off the late night menu and asked for pepperoni on the flatbread pizza to which she replied "we don't have pepperoni." And that was the end of that. The menu did read something along the lines of "ask for pepperoni! its free!" or something like that. Not a HUGE deal. The food was great the beer was great (we only got to enjoy one each since she took our beer menu and left us hanging the rest of the time.  This experience wasn't by any means a "bad" one. I will continue to come here in the future. I am updating this review to a 4 star, this place has everyone going for it except the service issues (which arent completely horrible)  GREAT FOOD FAIR PRICES GREAT BEER CLOSE TO MY HOME SMALL PARKING LOT (although Ive always been able to find a spot so its not too bad) MANAGEMENT APPEARS TO CARE ABOUT THE PATRONS EXPERIENCE  4 STARS.... 5 STARS once the service issues improve.

Everything was great until the check came and my card didn't swipe at first and they talked all loud about how I have to show my ID even though I showed it when I ordered beer I said "I'm not worried about it, keep it" and they basically yelled they were bringing it back. I said it's not a big deal that they had to photo copy my ID and card and they still kept talking loud about it to the point people were watching. Then the guy who wasn't being loud came back and said it swiped and I left my 20% tip and left. If/when I go back I'll be bring fucking cash...who knows it might still be suspect as fake. Everything was fantastic till it came time to pay, and for the experience alone.......

I work in the same plaza as this place and I came here after work due to a infected tooth.   From the time I clocked out, walked here, signed up as a new patient, waited, saw the doctor, got my script, walked back to work to get the script filled, waited for it to be filled, and went on my way home.   Total time was roughly 55mins-1hour  FAST.  Try to see Marguerite McClain if you can. She rocked! Super nice, friendly, and understanding!

Very quiet on the day I went. I said "whats up" to the Loss Prevention guy and he acknowledged and seemed like a nice guy. Which is uncommon except for where I work, being that I talk to my guys a lot since I'm in management. I didn't buy anything but it seemed like a nice laid back target.
