The Fletcher's at 12th and Bell is HORRENDOUS!! I usually have great experiences around the valley, but I took my car in to get an oil change and brake work. It turns out they found four things wrong, totaling over $500. I dropped my car off at 8:30 am and they informed me of the work needed by noon. I didn't think much of it. They told me that because they had to get some of the parts, my car wouldn't be done until noon the next day (he said noon at the latest). Later, when I stopped by the shop to get my house key I had mistakenly given them, they said nothing about the progress of my car. I called the next morning at 10 am to verify that I should come pick my car up around noon when the mechanic said he hasn't done anything on my car and there's no way it would have been done by noon. He said he can try to get it done by 5:30 pm. I decided I would just take it elsewhere. They called me back around 10:20 and confirmed I didn't want the work done but I'd have to pay a "docking fee" for the mechanic putting my car up to work on it. I told them there's no way I was paying. I told them I didn't want them to work on it and then they started?! When I went to pick up my car at 11, they told me I was just too impatient and if I had left them alone to do the work, my car would have been finished by now. Riddle me that: they would do 6 hours worth of work within 45 minutes? When I asked him that, he said no, it's noon now and two hours would have been enough. I showed him the clock that said 11 and he told me we were never going to agree. Clearly not, sir. You are incompetent.

Update: I took my car to a different mechanic where I found out that I only actually needed rear brake pads, one new rotor, an oil change, and a gasket cover (??). He said the other guy was lying about half the work he said needed to be done. Fletcher's on 12th and Bell wanted to charge me $600 for the work but the other mechanic got me in and out for $200.

This Fletcher's was incredible! I came here after a horrific experience with Fletcher's on 12th and Bell. I bought a groupon, so I had to stay with this company to redeem it. I was very hesitant, but I'm so glad I did. Everyone was great and honest! The estimate I got from a different place was about $600 but these guys found that I didn't need all the things the other guys were trying to charge for. They could have just went along with what was on the original estimate, but instead they took the honorable and dignified approach. They saved me $400 and fixed my car in less than 24 hours, even though they were short a mechanic. Seriously, I can't say enough great things about this place!!
