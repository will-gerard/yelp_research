OK, I've literally driven by this place a thousand times, never stopping because I thought it was a scary looking shack and couldn't believe that people actually ate here.  However - after a friend of mine told me that I was crazy and that the food was delicious, I had to try it.  Now I've eaten there three times this week.    I should also probably mention that I usually hate all things teriyaki - it's disgustingly over sweet and I can't understand why people like it.  BUT this place has it right - it's fresh, not out of a jar, and made by the sweetest people you'll ever talk to.  Try a chicken bowl with extra veggies and brown rice - you won't be disappointed.  And don't forget to order an eggroll - they're amazing and they come with this ridiculous ginger sauce that'll leave you craving more.

I'm finding these other two reviews to be very strange considering the experience my fiance and I had here.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say they've made some internal changes for the better, since the other reviews are 3 and 5 years old.  This place is wonderful.  The staff, the doctor - they are talented and completely comforting and warm individuals.  My fiance is the biggest baby when it comes to anything medical (the poor guy needs Xanax just to have his blood drawn, so when it came time for him to have his wisdom teeth out, no ifs, ands, or buts about it, this is where we were recommended to go.  I called our personal dentist and was informed that Dr. Day is one of the best oral surgeons in the state, which had me sold since my dentist (Dr. Mow) is pretty awesome.  Not only were they able to put my fiance at ease, but surgery was completed within 15 minutes, everything went smoothly, and after we returned home they were completely available for any questions we had.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Day and his staff - they're super nice.

I've lived in the Valley for 20 years and never ate here until a couple of months ago, despite it being highly recommended by a lot of people.  I think I have to rethink my opinion on the people that recommended it....YUCK!!!!!! The food has no flavor and everything is covered in shredded iceberg lettuce and "mexican cheese blend."  Plus the restaurant looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned or changed since 1984.  I actually didn't want to touch anything.    Shut this place down.  You're done.

Never a disappointment - I only wish I made more money so I could eat there every week.  The mussels are to DIE for - that broth could be served by itself with a loaf of bread - and everything there is fresh and amazing, always cooked exactly how I order it.  Additionally - your bartenders are gifts from heaven.  Seriously - the best dirty martinis E.V.E.R. *hearts*

Never Again. I live around the corner, and this is usually my staple for a fast burger, but I refuse to put up with the bad service.   I ordered one of their specialty burgers, and when I was confused about why the girl behind the counter kept asking if I wanted ingredients that didn't go on the burger I ordered, she actually chastised me for it, saying that I ordered wrong!  Then, they made my husband a milkshake with milk that had been sitting out for at least the 20 minutes we sat there. The food went into the trash and we will NOT be back.

I'll admit it freely - I have a SERIOUS addiction to Pho.  I can't go more than two weeks without it.   When I lived and worked in Old-town Scottsdale, this was my lunch spot at least twice a week if not more!  Their Pho is delicious and their broth is amazing all on its own, not to mention the plate of fresh herbs, jalapenos, limes and sprouts.  The staff is super nice too - the first time I ordered crispy spring rolls, they not only brought it super fast, they also taught me how to eat it properly, wrapped in lettuce with more veggies and a yummy light sauce.  The strip mall they're in is a little sketch, I'll admit, and the first time someone brought me there I was worried, but the food is delish and I eat there every chance I get!

Better late than never - I chose this company based on other Yelp reviews that I'd read for my move in June, 2011.   I was moving from Ahwatukee to Downtown Phoenix, and besides having a few antique pieces, I also have a really old piano.  The people at Camelback were professional, knowledgeable and answered every question.  They came out to assess my furniture, took measurements and scheduled my move exactly as I requested it.  On the day of the move, they showed up promptly, worked VERY fast, were clean and very careful with my stuff.  Everything was wrapped, everything was taken care of as if it was their own.  Once we got to my new place, they unpacked and CLEANED as fast as they'd packed!  The movers were really nice and easy to get along with as well.  I would recommend this company to anyone and the next time I move in Phoenix, they're the FIRST company I'm calling.  Great job!!

Delish! We drove around looking for a good steak without a wait and ended up at the Phoenician. With the restaurant concept by Jean Georges, we knew we were in for a treat.   The only reasons I'm giving 4 stars are two-fold:  The shrimp cocktail was overpriced - $18 for 5 shrimp? C'mon...yummy but lame.  And  The desert menu is seriously lacking - I was expecting to see at least one amazing thing and they were all boring: cake, apple fritter, cheesecake, gelato...boring!!  Other than that, everything was amazing. I'm getting over a cold and they brought me out my own tea kettle which sat next to the table and stayed hot for two hours. And the finishing salt they provided in a tiny bowl was a great touch!  Order a steak, it'll be cooked perfectly with a great crust on it. Have them bring all the sauces too; their bernaise is ridiculously fluffy - they infuse it with liquid nitrogen!!  And the beurre blanc is perfect and delicate.  YUM (PS, if you get Mercedes as your server, you're in for a treat! She's amazing!)

I am a New Yorker and I approve this PIZZA.  Seriously legit - these guys know what they're doing - prob b/c they're also from NY.    Plus they have veal parm heros - seriously like the only place in Phoenix that does that.  Good sauce, good crust, fresh cheese. (Did I mention fresh pasta?)  Seriously, this place is the ONLY thing I miss about living in Ahwatukee.  PLEASE PLEASE open a second location in Downtown Phoenix????  I'll even run it for you!

The company I work for is moving locations and we desperately needed our new office painted before we laid down some wood floors.  Operating on a budget, I was tasked to find a good painter at an even better price.  After several estimates, all of which seemed ridiculously high, I was referred to Robert by a coworker who had used Arizona's Best Painting for her home.   Not only did they come out and give me an estimate that was $1000 cheaper than the lowest we'd received, they were able to start work in the new office and finish in the same day.   I would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for great painters, and I plan to use them again when I redo my home this Fall.

Chandra is a doll and amazing at her job.  This salon is full service and perfect, plus AVEDA is probably the best thing you can put on your hair.  I've never been happier at any other salon.  Absolutely worth every penny

The only reason I'm giving four stars is because last time I was there, the bacon bread pudding was NOT on the dessert menu.  Srsly guys wtf?  Otherwise everything is delish and the service is great.  Kale Caesar, homemade sausage, pork belly pastrami, BACON POPCORN (can't stress that enough)!!!!  And order a Moscow Mule if you haven't had one.  Yum.  Go there now.

I'm going to have to go back to add to this one, but I want to spend every weekend here!  I just wish I'd brought boots that were made for walking (or dancing).  I stopped in on New Year's Ever for last call expecting a nightmare of a crowd, and after the hilarious bouncer allowed us inside, I heard the most amazing drum and bass coming from the back room.  I was immediately transported back to the late 90's when I enjoyed many a night in an abandoned Phoenix warehouse listening to local DJs spinning House, DnB and whatever other variety was happening at the time.  The crowd was mixed and accommodating and the bartenders knowledgeable.    Can't wait to go back with my dancing shoes!  PS - did I mention the DJ was actually spinning vinyl?  THANK YOU!

Since I live at the Tapestry, the concept of having a coffee shop outside my bedroom, literally, is AMAZING.  Plus, they brew local, Cartel coffee, which is my favorite local coffee next to Lola.  Oh, and the staff is great - they are all super nice and friendly all the time - I love this place.  (plus the rumor is that they're planning a wine bar next door, for which I vote YES!)  The only problem I have is that they don't open until 7am.  I usually get out of the gym around 6:15 and that's when I want to jog over and grab my daily cup, so what's the deal?!  Please open earlier.

I had a chance to sit down with the owner of this spot today.  I'm hoping that he'll be able to make some very minor modifications on the menu to account for the vegan population of downtown Phoenix.  Otherwise, I do believe that the owner cares about his businesses and the community.  Fingers crossed.   -- ORIGINAL Review:  Since the corner of McDowell and 7th Ave. is what I refer to as the place where chain restaurants go to die, it makes me happy that there's a local breakfast joint attempting to infiltrate the system.  The first time I ate here was a couple of weeks ago, early on a Sunday and it was delicious.  You walk up to the counter to order, get a number and then sit where you like.  It's small, but there's a nice outdoor patio which should be nice for the next couple of weeks.  Their coffee is amazing and they provide dairy alternatives for those of us who do not use cream in our coffee.    The first time I ordered the BMOC:  a waffle with apple/maple syrup, a smoked porkchop and eggs. (and a portuguese donut!)  Wowza.  Breakfast heaven. The second time I attempted to order the 3 Sisters Strata, but they hadn't received some order or something and it wasn't available, so I settled on the savory crepes.  Also delicious.  Their romesco sauce is delish.  HOWEVER - I can only give three stars.  My vegan friends are simply not able to eat here because whomever wrote the menu just doesn't provide easy alternatives and the second time I ate here my friend's pancakes showed up in 5 minutes while my fiance and I continued to wait an additional 30!  The manager was great about it and very professional, but his excuse about how pancakes are made faster than the rest is ridiculous - when there are orders that take longer, you simply make the longest item first and work your way up.    I'll probably be back, but I'm seriously hoping for some vegan alternatives on the menu and better time management.
