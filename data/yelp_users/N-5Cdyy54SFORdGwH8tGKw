Just ordered 2 large pies from here and everything turned out perfectly. Was my first time ordering here and will definitely be coming back.

Best burger and beer in the area. On top of that everything on the menu is delicious and you can always try something new on their daily specials menu. The staff is incredibly friendly and they know their product forwards and backwards. With an awesome craft brew selection that accommodates all tastes, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.

Friendly and knowledgeable customer service. Best selection of camera, lenses, and accessories in town. I highly recommend this place!

Not a fan. The burger was greasy and the meat, flavorless. I opted for the Arizona, so the only saving grace were the semi-spicy toppings. The staff definitely doesn't look like they enjoy being there and as another yelper said, the decor reminds me more of a carwash than a burger joint. For the price it costs to go there I'd definitely recommend taking your money and driving to the In-n-out nearby. Heck for a few dollars more you can head over to Four Peaks and have a REALLY good burger.

Great pizza for the price!! The crust is really good with a great flavor. What really makes this place nice though is the friendly service. You definitely get the feeling that these small business owners care about their product. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the neighborhood.  My only gripe is that their menu on their website and on their online ordering system don't ever seem to match. Whether its pricing or products something is always out of sync.
