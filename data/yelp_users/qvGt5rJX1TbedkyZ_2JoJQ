This restaurant was horrible! I went there a few weeks ago with my husband and his parents for my husband's birthday. All of the seafood we had was overcooked: lobster, stuffed shrimp and grouper. I highly doubt that they fly their lobsters in from Maine daily. The vegetables were not fresh or seasonal and the baked potato had no substance. How do you screw up a baked potato??! I think the lighting is so dim because they do not want you to actually see the food on your plate. The dessert, chocolate lava cake, wasn't even good. I grew up on the east coast and love old fashioned seafood restaurants; however, there is no comparison. I couldn't even dent the food on my plate because the thought of eating it made me feel sick. There are too many amazing restaurants in Scottsdale to come here and pay for overpriced, not fresh seafood.

The last 3 times I've used the pharmacy I've had issues with them not running my insurance correctly even though my plan hasn't changed in years. They always make it seem like it's my fault and that I don't have coverage, when I do. The wait at the drive thru is too long which takes away from the convenience of it. On one occasion they asked me to come inside after 20 minutes in the drive thru and then wait in line again, all because of their mistakes. The staff don't appear knowledgeable. I think it's time to switch pharmacies. :(

Just had the rudest worker at the pharmacy. The car ahead of us in the drive thru line took 20+ minutes. When it was our turn the tech asked our name, said hold on, was gone several minutes then we saw her grab her keys and drinks and leave. Several minutes later another tech came to the window. When I asked what happened she snapped at me!! Like its my fault that their customer service sucks?!

We went here a few weeks ago for my mother-in-law's birthday and everything was delicious! I had the scallops and the sauce was amazing! Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was amazing! Great restaurant for special occasions.

Love the chips, salsa and guacamole. Have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered. Favorite Mexican restaurant in the area!

I ordered a cake for a baby gender reveal party with Linda, the owner, who was a pleasure to work with. The cake was white (dyed blue) with Oreo filling and butter cream frosting. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I would definitely order a cake again. :)

Great happy hour. Love their appetizers and soups. After we order some apps and soup we are usually too full for entrees but it's so worth it!

I went there for a scheduled oil change that they told me would take 45 minutes. After being there for about an hour I asked them what the hold up was because I could see my car on the lift without anyone working on it. Apparently they drained the oil from my car then realized they did not have the right filter. (Granted my car is very common.) They had to call a parts store down the road and were waiting for the filter to be delivered. Without me inquiring they did not seem very communicative. They also should have known my car was coming in and ensured they had the right parts before beginning the work. They tried to make it right by giving me a gift card and coupon to Chick Fillet. Overall, my oil change took nearly 2 hours!

The salon is very clean and the staff is always a pleasure. I love their pedicures. They use new linings in each foot bath and the basic pedicure comes with a hot stone leg massage.
