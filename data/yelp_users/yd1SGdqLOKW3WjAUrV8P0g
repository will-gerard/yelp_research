Something inside each person is the desire to try something new. What makes a restaurant memorable? I for one enjoy the choices provided by unique establishments that bring delights from multiple cultures into a friendly place where you can take your friends, family, date, or wander in alone just to experience new possibilities. When you combine the tastes of two countries, Italy and Japan, you get Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe.   I have always had the friendliest service at each of my visits and delighted in bringing my family members or friends to visit and watch them enjoy the mounting possibilities of combining decisions. What nobody expects is how filling the food can get. Sometimes I'll have some sushi and try a different noodle dish than last time, and other times I'll close my eyes and point at anything on the menu - and I have yet to be disappointed.   The Noodle Cafe's atmosphere appears cramped, but there is a lot of detail that makes it special even when it is full. I will have to admit that sometimes I have felt forgotten by the staff sometimes, however it always seems so busy and their smiles are so big that it doesn't matter.   The standard appetizer dish given to you when you first sit down consists of several kinds of bread that take my mind off the outside world and make me realize I'm here to enjoy something tasty. The hustle of the staff and the laughs of the other patrons make me less aware that I am actually in a small strip mall in the middle of a city that usually doesn't feel like I'm around other human beings. Honestly, I make up every excuse to visit and recommend this restaurant to everyone.

This is my favorite place to visit for some delicious fruit, sandwiches, and incredibly friendly people. Upon entering, the staff will offer you free samples of the fruit they have to offer. I enjoy picking up local or organic fruits and vegetables and supporting the last remaining fruit stand left along Baseline Rd. Before the push to build along South Mountain, there were several others that lined the street. When the City of Phoenix widened the road, they took away the left hand turn to make it easily into the parking lot. I refuse to let such an inconvenience keep me from a place that I share with all of my friends, when I can get the chance. If you want to support a local business, experience real hospitality, and find something delicious to eat then I highly recommend Summers Fruit Barn.

Sushi Eye started out friendly where one could get to know the management and get a sense of family, however it has taken a severe downturn for the worst. I would not recommend this business for my friends, family, or even people I was not fond of. There are numerous other Sushi establishments where you can take your business and get the treatment you deserve with your hard earned money.  I have to say that I never thought I would give a restaurant one star unless I was so unimpressed or insulted by the eatery that I have to just alert others.
