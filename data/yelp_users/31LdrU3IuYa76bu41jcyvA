For my first visit to The Melting Pot, I decided to go on my birthday with my husband, my parents and his parents. We were sat in a back room all by ourselves. Literally we could have heard a pin drop. Normally, I would have LOVED this ... However it must have been a package deal: get your own room, get crappy service. Granted, I didn't expect to be in and out of the place within an hour, but I also didn't expect it to take three and a half hours either! Our server was SO slow. We normally NEVER have a lack of dinner conversation, however we found ourselves twiddling our thumbs just waiting for our server several times. The food, however, was delicious. But NOT worth the prices they charge. Unfortunately, this was my first and last visit to The Melting Pot.

The best thing about this place was the car wash your car is driven through. The reason being, is because that required no human interaction.  Horrible job! Couldn't even tell if my car was vacuumed. And one of the three finishers who was assigned to my car, completely forgot my cars interior! No dash, no windows, nothing.  Won't be returning.

I've gotten takeout from this place twice now and both times I have been very pleased. Their food is extremely flavorful and well prepared. The atmosphere is the actual restaurant is nothing to write home about, however it is extremely clean. We will continue going back here!

I'm so glad we decided to give this place a try. I'm not usually a big sushi eater, but I decided to give some a shot and was pleasantly surprised! The flavors in the two different varieties we ordered was fantastic. We then split an order of the Mongolian Chicken and it was delicious. The chicken tasted fresh, unlike some other Asian restaurants we have been to. The atmosphere was very hip and trendy and our waitress was a blast! We will ABSOLUTELY be back!

I've been to Camarones several times and keep coming back. From my house, it's a good 30 minute drive, but it's well worth it. I personally don't enjoy restaurants that have such a noisy atmosphere that you have to practically yell at the person sitting across from you just to have a conversation. Camaromes is NOT like that at all. This place has a very upscale vibe to it. Granted, the outside cantina will appease those who would like their blaring music, but I'm more of an "enjoy my dinner" type of person. The variety of the menu is fantastic! From tacos to pasta. And I have yet to try something that I didn't enjoy. I was also extremely impressed with the numerous vegetarian options on the menu. Generally you don't find that at other Mexican restaurants whose main ingredient is lard. I recently went there with a party of 8 people. The service was impeccable! I'll continue to frequent this place!

Based solely on the previous reviewers good experience with this landscaper, I decided to give him a call. He was very nice on the phone, however he never showed up at my house to take care of my yard. No phone call, nothing. Either his business is so incredibly booming right now, or his phone and vehicle were swallowed up in a space-time vortex. Regardless, he successfully lived up to my expectations regarding landscapers.

I just recently used Eli for the first time based on reviews I read here on Yelp. I had wanted to install an interior door between our master bedroom and bathroom for years. I still don't understand why modern builders find it acceptable to simply put an archway or empty doorway between these two rooms. Anyway, over the past few years I had called several places to get quotes on getting this project done. It was always just out of my budget, so I put it off. Recently, I decided to just bite-the-bullet and get it done. I called Eli once, and the rest of the communications were through email (which was perfectly fine with me, due to my crazy work schedule). The door I needed, to match the rest of my house, needed to be ordered. I paid the deposit to get the door ordered, and when it arrived a couple weeks later we scheduled the install. Eli and Rudy arrived exactly when they said they would, almost to the minute. They were very professional, extremely courteous, and their attention to detail is admirable. There were no surprise charges, and I paid the remaining balance immediately after they finished, which was only a couple hours after noon. I plan to use Eli again in the future for some additional projects that I keep putting off, and I highly recommend him.
