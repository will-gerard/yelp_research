Yay for small theaters!!!! Seriously. All you people that love those huge grandiose things need to experience the intimacy and power that comes with a small theater, and a nice one on top of that.   The Herberger is in a great location and is a great venue to see a show. The staff is always really friendly and the space is always clean. It has class without being too stale and old. Like downtown hipster class. It's nice. Soothing. Fun. Good for all ages.   The bar inside also has a window for the outside patio which is great for nice evenings and intermissions :) Also, if you're lucky you will see some musical troubadours outside as well.  One awesome thing is that you can get parking validated for the Arizona Center for $3. You park there, take your ticket, then go to the Herberger box office and get a validation ticket. When you exit the Arizona Center, enter the ticket you got when you parked and then the validation one.  So now you have no more excuses not to go (if the light rail didn't help already).  See you there!!

If you care about your car, you'll make the effort to head to Los Olivos Hand Car Wash. I'm pretty particular and careful about the care of my car. So much so, that in the past, unless I need it waxed or detailed, I usually washed and vacuumed myself.   Now, I find myself still sneaking in for a little TLC at Los Olivos though, when I am too lazy to do it myself. The staff is super nice and very helpful with letting you know about what they offer and any specials without being pushy in any way. They even have a punch card and eventually you get a free wash. Pretty dandy eh?   The waiting area isn't top notch, but it's a car wash people. It does have a small shop with sodas, snacks, gift cards, random misc car items and some chairs to sit and wait. Supposedly there's a shoe shiner, but I'm still waiting for the day we're there at the same time. Additionally, Giant Coffee is just a hop, skip and a jump away, and that's usually where I am while I wait.  I've been a loyal customer for awhile now, and this past weekend, realized it was time to get the interior of the car detailed again. They did a spectacular job which prompted my need to review. I ordered the mini detail which does a full job inside and a wash and buff/wax outside. The four hours was so worth it. They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe. Ever since, I've been showing her off, and it feels like I'm in a brand new car all over again. The paint is shiny and new, the inside was cleaned from top to bottom (even the ceilings) and the detail in the dashboard and console is incredible. I had already decided to never go anywhere else, but now I think I'll be getting it detailed much more often.  You will not be disappointed. I love this place.

I held true to my word and tried lunch here shortly after trying breakfast. I walked out with a texan to go and was completely happy and satisfied the rest of the day. And I came back the next weekend, and had the same thing again.  I still wish they had better hours so I could enjoy them some evening after work when I didn't feel like cooking, but no matter what the hours, when they combine their cheese with their stuff, it's a total win.

I swear. Some friends never steer me wrong when it comes to deliciousness.   I was told the house special chicken is the thing to try at China Chili. However, after looking at the menu, and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase "pillow shaped morsels" how could I resist? There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half.   I loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans. They reminded me of ones at a fantastic restaurant near where I grew up. The inside is really spacious and has some fantastic traditional decor. The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food. Fun? Yep. I'd like some.  Downside? The parking lot is tiny and narrow. Parking in a space perfectly if there are cars on both sides of the spot is a feat I'd love to see mastered.

For a long time I heard from various people that the lights are phenomenal at Hinkley's but that I would pay for it dearly. I'd just like to state that in no way is that true.  I went in needing something different, something fun to change up some spaces. Looking through the store I was more worried that none of the displays matched what I wanted exactly more than the price. Hesitant, I went to the counter and asked to look at some flush mount lights for a hallway that are more of a brushed metal finish.  What did I end up finding? Lights for everything I needed that were exactly what I was picturing in my head. The price probably exceeds Home Depot, but these aren't your typical lights. After doing some price comparison, the lights were very reasonably priced and I went in the next day to place an order. Jennifer, the woman that helped me previously, answered all my questions and helped me with everything. In the end, they were even able to swing a discount on some of the items, thus lowering the price more.  If you are looking for lights in Phoenix, please ignore all the misconceptions about insanely high prices at Hinkley's. The service is fantastic, the lights are gorgeous to look at, and the prices are insanely competitive.

What a hidden gem!! I've been here several times already since finding it when I arrived too early for Karsh's bakery and I love it every time. I can never finish everything I order and the wait staff is always as friendly and fun as can be. The cherry blintzes are the bomb and there is plenty of room for large crowds. Additionally they open early, which is nice for me as I am more of an early bird than most.   The black and white cookies that are filled with frosting are a glutton's dream. If that's not up your alley, ask for a male or female brownie. Hint: the male brownies have nuts!

I wanted to post a review on the waitress we had for Smunch yesterday, Nancy, but it looks like I can only review a business so I'll just update this one.  When I walked into Scott's this week and asked if I could make a reservation for a large group during Saturday brunch hours, they said no problem without any hesitation. When organizing Smunch every month, this is a lovely thing to hear.   The table was already set up and ready when I arrived and people started gathering shortly after. We wanted separate checks, though not all separate and Nancy didn't miss a beat. She was amazing. And hilarious. She joked with us the entire time and told us of her serious karaoke schedule.  At one point, someone at our table got up for a minute, and shortly after their food came out. Nancy just sat right down and pretended to eat it. And let us capture photographic evidence.   I now will come back more frequently. And sit in Nancy's section every single time.

This may be one of the most romantic restaurants in Phoenix, but there was nothing romantic about the way I devoured my food today at Coup Des Tartes, and I mean that in the nicest way possible.   I found Coup Des Tartes on a whim and decided it was the perfect spot for a girls lunch with some coworkers to just chill without the guys upon my return home. I was right on the money. The place is cozy and inviting and I love the house setting that just makes you want to let you guard down. Right near our table was a photo of a flower girl and ring bearer at a wedding, just like one you'd have hanging in the hallway at your house. Everything was beautiful, right down to the French limonade bottle used for our water at the table.   I can also honestly say pretty much all the food is good, well at least the appetizers and desserts... we shared a lot of items and never made it to a main course. Here are the items we had (prepare for a long list):  Soup of the Day (Roasted Red Pepper) Brie Brulee Chevre / Tomate Three Onion Tarte Latte with a shot of hazelnut Banana Brulee Chocolate Peanut Butter Tarte  I have to say that everything was truly decadent and I wanted to eat 50 more of them. The red pepper soup was the perfect starter and had just the right amount of flavor. The three onion tarte we split and downed within probably a minute or so!! This also came with a side of lettuce with a shallot vinaigrette for an added bonus (yum). I don't like tomatoes so I have to admit I didn't really have the main part of the chevre/tomate but the cheese and bread it was on was absolutely delicious. And the brie? Yum.... oh the beautiful brie. The carmelized apples on top..mmmmmmmmm an the fruits and bread with it really topped it all off perfectly.  Just when we thought we were all done, we were told about banana brulee and chocolate peanut butter tart. How delicious were both of them. On what we thought were full stomachs, we devoured them whole while I also enjoyed a latte with a shot of hazelnut. It came with a cube of raw sugar and was placed in the most simple yet adorable coffee cup and saucer.   In the end, the price was well worth it and the staff was amazing and kind. They gave us just the right amount of space and truly let us enjoy ourselves. The pounds my scale added to my weight afterward was well worth it. It just means salad and a run tonight :)  Thank you Coup Des Tartes. I'll definitely be back. I haven't had a chance to try lunch or dinner yet :)

I will begin by saying that I've been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means.   Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring.  My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. I'll be back.  *I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future

I'm sure I'm not the only homeowner that bought a house and then was like, wait.. where's the key to the sprinkler system. I had no clue what kind I had as the cover had been painted and had no clue where to even begin. Thank goodness my realtor at Twins & Co. recommended Sprinkler World.   I walked in one afternoon with photos of the painted cover and a thought from my realtor as to what the brand was (which I quickly half forgot of course). I walk in, feeling like a complete idiot as I tell my story and say the name of the manufacturer wrong multiple times (and don't realize it until I'm corrected by a play-laughing staff member on my way out).  I got a few keys to make sure I never lose them again... they were the right ones the first time.. and they're super cheap.   Total win!!! And they've gained my trust!!

While I didn't buy my first mac here, I definitely frequent this store most to feed my Apple addiction. Luckily my trusty little macbook has never needed a trip yet, nor has an iPod, but most of its accessories and my drooling happens here, which I hope the staff is paid well to clean that up. If not, I'm sorry.  I like the way things are laid out at this store, and I like how I can come in with an iPod I received as a gift and trade it in for another one :) What I don't like is how unorganized it is to find an employee to help you unless you have an appt with the geniusii (yes I made that plural up). I thought it sucked that the Sprint store puts people in their queue even to speak with a sales rep, until I went to the Apple store and wished they had the same. For that, you lose a star.

Fantastic!!! My first visit to Mountain View was for a follow up appointment after I was rear ended in a car accident, thanks to a friends recommendation. I loved how much information their website had and being able to see which doctors were accepting patients, which weren't and where their areas of specialty lie. I called and made an appointment with Dr. Bauer and was able to get an appt within a few days. She's been my primary care physician ever since.  The office is great and very orderly. The sign in receptionist is different from the one taking payments. Additionally, they check to see if you need to make any type of copay or payment and only call you up if it's required. Otherwise you can just sit and relax and wait your turn.   You don't need to wait forever to get in and be seen either.   My last visit involved a pretty thorough exam and some immunizations to which I informed the receptionist ahead of time when I called. I asked if it would be a problem to have all these done in the same visit and I was told no. I was disappointed when I got there and received a waiver to sign that stated I was only going in for a wellness check and anything else would require an extra visit. It wasn't the extra visit that bothered me as much as I wish someone would've been up front with me. This is my only complaint. However, I do understand I had some interesting circumstances.  Dr. Bauer and her staff are amazing. They are very conversational in a nice way rather than a creepy I'm -just-trying-to-start-a-conversation-to-avoid-being-awkward way and answer any questions you have and are very upfront about what is going on. My physical went well and my immunizations were a breeze too. After expressing my concern with a second visit, I was able to schedule an appt for only two days later.   Also to note, I didn't have to go to another level of the building to receive my blood work.

You never know how awesome a service or staff is until shit hits the fan and it's crunch time. For this reason, Dr. Bauer and her assistant deserve way more than 5 stars, and I owe everyone an update on this review.  I've had a handful of doctor's appointments over the past few weeks, four of them with Dr. Bauer. Not once have I had an issue and every single time there is nothing but helpfulness whenever I have to have yet another crazy unheard of test ran. They've spent countless hours working on the paperwork I need to submit with all the results without appearing hassled or bothered. They've also promptly called me when my results are in or for any other status update I request.  Additionally, they are very patient when my prescription company acts like an asshat. Due to circumstances I needed to have a 6 month fill of my prescription rather than the typical 3 month I receive. When I emailed my prescription company, they told me this was possible if the doctor's office called it in. However, my doctor's assistant tried several times and got nowhere. Today I was there with her and she patiently tried one last time and made sure my prescription went through as requested. It was something that she really didn't need to do but kindly did for me despite how much of a pain in the ass it was.  Without a doubt I recommend Dr. Bauer and her assistant 110%.

Best. Bowling Shoes. Ever.   Yep. I said it. I'm not taking it back either. I got me some bomb ass bowling shoes that I actually want. Where do they buy these fantastic things? Mine were this awesome almost olive green color with burgundy laces. Fan-flippin-tastic.  The inside of the bowling alley surprised me and made me smile. The tables were actually exquisite. Yes I also used the word exquisite in regards to bowling alley decor. The bar was gorgeous too. The animations and clips between frames and so forth were a little odd and unexpected but pretty hysterical. I loved the murals on the sides of the lanes that worked perfectly with the cosmic bowling lighting as well as the mural on the back wall near the bar that showed a tale of bowling long ago.  Some of the set up of the alley was awkward, such as the huge tables being out of reach from the bowling area and therefore are probably only used in leagues. The bowling area seating wasn't anywhere near as exquisite and had no place to put your drink but on top of the bowling ball shelf.   The music was hopping though the transitions between the songs could've been better and some of the songs were repeated. However, the birthday medley that was played in my honor was an amazing mix. The bar was also a little slow but the prices were great. The price for bowling itself was also a bonus. $11 for all you can bowl *and* shoes on a Friday night is pretty stellar.   Sunset Bowl also was willing to work with our event in advance and was super fantastic. They make me want to go bowling more often.

Sky Harbor airport all in all is not that bad. If you've been to other airports, you'll clearly understand why. On my scale it's a 3.5, but I had to bump it up to a 4 after thinking about all the other horrid airport experiences I've had elsewhere.  Here are my favorite things about Sky Harbor: -- Traffic to the airport is usually not that bad -- Free Wifi, which you think would be common, surprisingly is not in most airports, but is fantastic at Sky Harbor -- Easy to navigate and get through security and where you need to go -- Clean -- Typically not crowded and not a bad place to be if you end up there early. I usually sprawl out, and sit and read a book, do some work, catch up on miscellaneous tasks very easily without feeling cramped or some person trying to strike up a conversation with me  Some downsides: -- It's hard to find an outlet that works depending on what terminal you are at -- It's nice to have rental cars all in one spot but if you ever need one that place is like a bottleneck and it can take awhile. -- One time I had to go to the continental cargo facility and it took me 45 minutes to find it

One of the most relaxing places that's within biking distance from my house. I, am indeed, one lucky gal!   While it's not huge, the farm can keep me occupied for hours on end. I just love the serenity and beauty of it all, and taking time to breathe deeply and enjoy the little things in life.   The Maya Farm apparently has amazing CSA shares I am going to buy into shortly that include flowers. I buy myself flowers every week, so this is a super fantastic deal :)  The little art shops and gardens are just beautiful and everyone is so nice and kind. I spent quite a bit of my stay there today playing with an adorable boston terrier.   Downfall is the lack of good places I felt safe parking my bike. Bonus is I just brought it with me (consider it my dog) wherever I traveled.   I will be back here... again.. and again.. it's a great weekend morning trip. I took some fantabulous photos today.

South Mountain is a little bit of a toss up for me, but generally it is good.  My first few experiences with South Mountain brought the user experience professional in me out as I actually wanted to attempt to hike a specific trail. Instead, all that happened was horrendously marked trails that left me wandering miles in the wrong direction.   Was it necessarily that bad? No. Most of the time, I don't care which trail I am on or am not on. The girl scout in me isn't too bad at finding my way home and I love random unplanned adventures. However, there are times where I am out to conquer a specific trail and then this problem is highly relevant and makes me swear so loudly I think the bobcats may think it an invitation to come out and play.  All in all it's a win. I've taken many the afternoon, morning, or all day suited with some water, sunglasses, and my hiking shoes and some granola bars and hit the trails either for a casual hike with friends or a serious full out trek. Sometimes I'm not only stupid enough to run up one small summit that was way farther than it seemed, but I'm stupid enough to do it twice.   South Mountain doesn't judge though. And I appreciate that.

I love sushi. I love Sakana. First off, their sushi is typically on point. I've only ever had one item I disliked and that's the seabass. Not a fan. One item that's a must have is their house smoked salmon nigiri. Holy effing awesome. I always want to eat like a dozen orders of that stuff.   The best reason of all for Sakana though, is that they are open on Sundays and have a happy hour. For some reason I am always craving sushi on Sundays and there is a huge lack of good places open. Sakana saved me and I will return the favor by telling of its awesome.

I'm a pretty big ice cream/gelato fan. Pretty big. I stumbled upon Angel Sweet for the first time with the thanks of my handy dandy GPS recommending the closest place to offer me sweet cold delicious victory. Angel Sweet was what popped up.   I am pretty impressed with their selection of gelato. I typically get a fruit/cream combination and haven't been disappointed as of yet. They also have a punch card to help out all those addicts. That rocks.  My only complaint is that the inside is rather small, and while it's cute, the chairs aren't very comfortable at all. I can never seem to stay :(

I was craving Thai like no other today (go figure) after passing Tipps 88 in Tempe while running errands. Seeing that it's closed on Sundays (thanks Gabi!) I convinced a friend (okay it didn't take any convincing at all) to head to Swaddee in our continuing search for best Thai food in Phoenix.  Swaddee is hidden away in the corner of a plaza, but the inside decor does not disappoint. It's not too large and not too small. Rather, it's just the right size. The tables were simple. We had a one with a black cloth, an image centered in the middle, and a glass overlay but I was completely drawn to it.   We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It had the right amount of spices and flavor as well as the right amount of heat. My main course was the pineapple curry (medium), which was just as incredible. It was a little hotter than medium, which was perfect and full of flavor. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the pineapple was fresh. For dessert, my friend ordered the coconut ice cream and I ordered the golden banana (banana and coconut in a spring roll). We ended up each taking half the banana and opening it like a spring roll and putting ice cream on top. Hands down this is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even if you dine alone at Swaddee, you *have* to order both. I'm not going to lie. I might come back here just for dessert.   I'm glad to have finally found another Thai restaurant other than Malee's I can call home!

I will just say that this is only the second time I have ever been to an eye doctor. In my entire life. I've never had issues with my eyesight fortunately enough. One of my coworkers recommended Gilbert Family Eye Care and when it comes to doctors, I'd rather go on recommendations than what is closest to my house.   Being that this was only my 2nd eye exam and my previous one I don't remember all that well, I walked in not really knowing what to expect.   The receptionist had me fill out the typical forms and I only waited a matter of a few minutes before I was brought back to begin my exam. I went through a series of tests in which each one was explained to me beforehand. It was very comforting to know exactly what I was getting into. Rather than having my pupils dilated I had a photo taken of them, which saves the drama. It was so quick and simple and the results of it were amazing to look at. The back of your eyes look like crazy planets. Just sayin.  The doctor went through the test results and the pictures for me and told me things I never even knew about my eyes and double checked before I left to ensure all my questions about any of the results had been answered. He was super friendly and informative and I felt completely comfortable there.   What do I wish was different? I inquired about receiving a digital copy of the photographs that were taken and was told they would be emailed to me. After waiting a day I called back, and was told they would be sent today. I still haven't received them, which means I have to find time to call back tomorrow.

Dear Devil's Martini North, Thank you for playing Beyonce and Pitbull throughout the night last night. Because of you the jeans I bought the same day are loose and I've lost 2 more lbs.  Seriously, I can see the cougar potential here, but I am desperately in love with the vibe of this place. You can't do much better at hitting my sexy sophistication love than this place did. The tables alone the sides, the couches, the dance floor and not bad drinks make me wish there was a place like this closer to me, and that I was actually with a date last night.  We arrived around 9:30 and walked right in. It wasn't too crowded last night and the drinks were just the right size and strength. The music was fantastic too.  This is a win ladies. A definite win.

Yelp definitely did not lead me astray. I just came back from the best dental visit I've had in my entire 29 years of existence.   Okay, yes, I will explain.  I've had several horrible dentist experiences that I don't even want to relive enough to recount here. I've also only ever had two cavity fillings and one root canal my entire life. No braces, no retainer... nothing. Yet every dentist visit I would leave in tears after being told how horrible my teeth are or some other crazy remark that I needed thousands of dollars in additional work done. I'd also leave crying from the pain of having my pretty much perfect teeth cleaned.  Having been in the area a year now, I figured it was time to head to the dentist. I searched and asked everyone for recommendations. It wasn't the distance from my house that mattered as much as the amazing care and treatment I would receive. After reading the other yelp reviews, I headed to Thompson Peak.  From the moment I got in, I was not disappointed. The hygienist I saw, Valerie (I really hope that's right) was amazing. She told me right up front that she could tell it had been awhile but yet I never felt a thing. I've never had such a painless cleaning in my entire life. Honest truth.   Dr. Dachs was equally as incredible. He was conversational in a good way rather than that awkward what do you say to someone when you're touching their teeth way or that I'm going to ask you a question while you can't talk way. I was told my teeth look good and wasn't left to feel bad for some random reason I won't be able to recall.   Fantastic fantastic fantastic. I can honestly say I will go back to the dentist in 6 months and probably for the first time in 29 years, not walk in worried and paranoid. I will actually be able to relax.

While I love Sprint to death, I am not a fan of this store. I want to bring back the days where I don't have to put my name on some list that shows on a huge screen at the front of the store just to purchase an accessory for my phone because it's not in a place I can access it.. but rather at the back of the store. I want the day where I can ask a question about my account without putting myself on the same list. When I can't find something at the kiosk at Arizona Mills, I have to resort to this store and I can't stand it.

How can you not love REI? I'm not really sure what type of personality that would be. Probably insanely boring. REI has great gear for hiking, camping, all sorts of sports and you can't beat being a member.  The store in Tempe is pretty clean and fairly close to my house. The staff for the most part has always been helpful aside from the one time I was told something I wanted didn't even exist (yet it was available online).  I have to lower them to 4 stars because there's been so many times I've had to order from REI online and have it delivered to the store because they didn't carry what I wanted.

Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line. No, it's not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at.  "Hey! What do you want?"  Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.  Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.  The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about.

Eh. Just further proves I really am not a chain type of person.   Swung in here over the weekend with a friend hoping to score some sheet music (not entire volumes of collections) for the guitar and maybe the piano and have a guitar restrung.   Store seemed small and cramped and the music selection leaves everything to be desired. It was sad. There were no individual songs and even the amount of books was small also.  On the plus side, everyone was nice, and they did restring the guitar while we grabbed some food. However, I still prefer my small local music stores.

Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.  I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.  I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic.   I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory.   Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.  We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool.   I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.  Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.  Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.  In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, "You can have whatever you want."  I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore.   Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)

I have to admit that reading the vast range of reviews for My Florist made me debate giving them a 3 for inconsistency, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and rounded my 3.5 up to a 4. It's almost hard to believe we all ate at the same establishment.   I made my first visit to My Florist for a fabulous #smunch breakfast with friends. I had never been but had looked at their website and just loved the story of the restaurant. Someplace with character, that's more than a building definitely gets my attention. The photos on the website also do not do this place justice. Every time my gaze wandered around various parts of My Florist I was continually floored. It's so beautiful and such a great conversation piece. When our huge group was seated we lucked out and got what I like to refer to as the king's table. The chairs were so exquisite to look at and even more comfortable than they appeared. I just sank into them and hit an instant pre food happy coma. Everyone seems to have issues with the piano, but I kinda wished they were playing. I almost went and started playing myself.   As far as the food, I have mixed feelings. I started off with a mimosa which was excellent and very reasonably priced. I then had wanted the frittata but they were pre-made and I was unable to have it without tomato. I am not a fan of pre-made... or tomato. Having to make a last minute decision I went with my staple, an omelet. I had Gruyere, chicken, and mushroom and a side of Nutella for my toast. I also ordered a limosa.  The omelet was okay but not outstanding and a little pricey. However, I immensely enjoyed the toast. Non ordinary toast makes me happy. The side of Nutella was a little pricey in my opinion, but was huge. I was able to use gobs for both my pieces of toast and someone else's. I think the eggs benedict that a few got looked tasty and I'd go again to try that. The salad menu also looked delightful. The limosa? Delicious.  As far as service goes, I didn't have any issues. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly and didn't mind our crazy large party of nearly 12. Our food all arrived at nearly the same time and within a reasonable amount of time. She also was nice enough to split our checks the exact way we wished. Can't beat that.

Eff. I really love Easley's. Sometimes I go in and don't even buy anything just to stare at the costume heads all lined up in a row.   This past weekend I went in for items to put together a nontypical outfit. It was busy, as it typically is around Halloween, but it didn't bother any of the employees. I had several on hand to help me with every small piece. What's even better is that they pretended to be all into my costume and thought it was the best idea ever. Great salespeople skills!!!  From the accessories to the wig to helping me find ways to customize a men's costume as I really don't think every single dress up idea should be turned slutty, they were on it. And I left impressed and happy.

MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS!!!!!!!!!  Old maps. New maps. Big maps. Small maps. Paper maps. Laminated maps. Framed maps. Globe maps. This place has all the maps. I don't think they were too happy with me when I walked in one day looking for the cheapest world map I could find (I was only going to be tearing it up for an art project), but they totally had me hook line and sinker with the gorgeous framed maps, globes and vintage road maps they held within their walls. I will be back. Because cartography is awesome. And who doesn't want to dream about the places they can go?  The staff is pretty well versed on maps. I've never seen anyone more knowledgable. It also looks like they will make you custom maps of an area you are needing (part of a city, etc...). Bonus is that they offer a AAA discount too. Because AAA doesn't have all the maps. Like world maps. You can only get those at a wide world of maps.

How can you not seriously love this place? For real. I dare any of you to tell me otherwise, and then I will make fun of you and call you lame. I've been to Lo-Lo's several times, and it's about time I inform everyone of their amazing treat of chicken and waffles. And the red kool-aid. Don't deny it. I don't care if you are 75. You still crave you some kool-aid every now and then. And now you can have it. With dinner. In a jar. And mom and dad can't even yell at you.   The atmosphere and location are both real and authentic. Expect to feel like you are in grandma's house, sitting somewhere near the kitchen and waiting for some amazing southern food.   I always want to try the red velvet cake or the mac and cheese but I can never get past the tre tre.... 2 fried chicken legs and a waffle and that's all it takes for my stomach to be full.  Be warned they only take cash here, but it's worth it.

This past weekend I had my staycation in Phoenix for a little downtime. Saturday a few friends and I wanted to go somewhere delicious no one had been and one of them suggested Portlands. I had only been there for drinks a couple times, and loved the bar area, so I figured it would be nice to come back and try some dinner.  One thing that amazes me about this area is how there are always so many cars parked along the road, yet no one is ever in any of the establishments (aside from Fair Trade). Luckily there is the slightly hidden parking deck so we were able to find a spot there. We got there right on time for our reservation. It was very empty when we got there yet it took a good 15 minutes to be seated. I can't say the dining service here is very efficient.  However, there are so many things on their menu I want to try that I can see myself coming back a few times. I started off sharing the scallop appetizer with the butternut squash with a friend and it was so good. The butternut squash was PERFECT and the scallops were mouth watering.  My main dish was the pork with the bourbon apple glaze and the au gratin potatoes and vegetables (I feel horrible that I forget the name). It was just the right amount of food and absolutely delicious. The au gratin potatoes were fabulous and the glaze on that pork was to die for. It had huge apple chunks with it too and omg... so delicious. The vegetables were carrots and two spears of asparagus and I have to admit they weren't the best. I usually kill for asparagus and the carrots tasted better.  The burgers on the back of the menu looked amazing as well as the phyllo chicken a friend had. The menu's fantastic. You need to try it.

Completely running into this place by accident, without the aid of friends or yelp reviews, I am overwhelmingly pleased that I not only found a place I enjoyed that night, but for many occasions to come.   I wasn't really sure what to expect when I walked in, and at first I was overwhelmed. It seemed like a neverending lot of treasures to discover. There were old signs all over the walls, stop lights, the ads in the glass on the tables, a wagon full of 'fixins for everyone to add to their meal.  As I eyed the menu and gazed upon the rest of the establishment, there were a few tables occupied with an older group of friends and a young boy with his dad. There were also a few people at the bar, which I spotted in the other room as I finalized my decision. While I waited, I ordered a coke and loved that they had the digital you can do anything you want with your soda machine. Total win! I think I sat and played with it for minutes. Luckily there wasn't a line.   Overall the place has a nice relaxing feel in my opinion. It may look like it should be dirty, but I assure you its not. There's a huge part of the restaurant that is not near the bar for the family folk. Outside the bar is a patio that apparently has horseshoes. Oh yes, you heard me right. Who's coming with me to play horseshoes?  I ordered the green chili burger and it was amazing. Lids are offered for the plastic condiment cups at the 'fixins bar for those who are ordering to go, like I was.  Looks like a potential nice place to sit back and watch a game... or play horseshoes... :)

Dear Persian Garden Cafe,  I was so excited when I discovered your flier on my front doorstep that I immediately emailed a friend in the area to see when we could schedule a time to visit. I also couldn't wait that long, and ended up visiting you two days later, craving good Persian food that is so hard to find here. I researched the menu online, but wanted to make my to go order in person to get a good feel for the atmosphere. This is about where the good stuff ends. Be prepared as I now tell you about the sadness I experienced after I walked in the door.  When I arrived, and wanted to double check my order on a to go menu, I was directed to one on a table that had 1/3 of the items on the menu you list on your site. I then inquired as to other items I had heard of but weren't on this menu. The staff member was surprised and reluctantly handed me a real menu to which I found the items I wished to order.   So what did I order?  A spinach/cucumber dip with naan. The dip was fairly delicious but I didn't get to enjoy much of it due to the naan being hard, almost to the point of being stale. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Does it not travel well?   The spicy chicken dish with vegetables and Persian rice with spices and raisins was just meh. Nothing like the dish I was expecting. The rice was the part I was anticipating most, and the part the gave me the most disappointment.   The best part of the entire menu was the lemonade I tried which I think was spiced with a bit of ginger. It was delicious. Sadly this was forgotten about with the bad ordering experience, sub-par food experience and the over the top bill for it all.  I may try one more time, this time dining in... but even that scares me a little.

I'm not the world's biggest Italian food fan. Mainly because most common establishments just up the tomato and call it pasta without being creative. I have to admit I never thought I'd ever step in this place either, let alone review it with four stars, but I am, and all thanks to a pasta loving friend and an indecisive day.  My review is based solely on their pasta primavera, which, after trying for the first time, I went back on my own to have it again. Three more times. This is huge for me.   The portion is perfect sized and the vegetables which is mainly squash heaven is just perfect. The bread that accompanies it is soft and flavorful also. It's truly the perfect dish for a non tomato/pasta lover like myself.   The staff is really friendly and always strikes up a small conversation when I come in. The prices are reasonable and for the most part, it seems fairly empty every time I've stopped in.   I don't typically crave pasta, but find myself craving this on occasion, which means it's top notch.

I never would've thought that over a year later I would be coming back to update my Thai Rama review, but I feel it needs to be said. Especially after visiting another Thai restaurant in the area last night and realizing it doesn't even come close in comparison.   From what I recall, the spice I recall from earlier visits was good but nothing spectacular and the dessert was fabulous. Since then, I've been a crazy regular at Thai Rama and it never fails, I'm craving their Thai specifically at least once a week. Usually for yellow chicken curry.  The prices are very reasonable and the dinner portion is enough to last me at least two meals. AT LEAST. The curry containers are a really sturdy plastic, which means they not only stay safe on the drive home, but they are reusable and recyclable.  And the heat people. Wow. Let me tell you, that it's on point. And then some. The heat is perfect. I am pretty tolerant, and love, a good amount of heat in my food. And medium here is usually the most I can handle. Any more, and I'm buying a gallon of milk for the meal too.  To Go orders are pretty quick, which is convenient and the staff is so friendly. I'm always offered water and a seat while I'm waiting.   This is on my permanent take out rotation!!

When deciding to finally get a gym membership again (those summer months are not made for running, I don't care what anyone says), I found it hard to look anywhere but a YMCA. As a child, that's where we always had a membership. A YMCA is where I took swim lessons, where I learned I am not good at indoor soccer, even if it does involve cute jr high boys, and where my dad took me with him to use the real gym for the first time. There's something about YMCAs that make you feel like home, and the Chris-Town YMCA is no different.   The staff, first and foremost, is very friendly. From my first visit to every one after, they've always been kind and answered any questions I have had, no matter how silly.   The instructors are the same way. I took my first ever spin class here, and I didn't feel like an idiot when I wasn't sure how the hell to set that bike up. And no one judged me for the sad looks on my face when any gear above 14 was mentioned. Oh. And the bike class was outside that morning. Awesome!! The zumba class on Thursday nights is a great mix of different types of people at all different skill levels. And the studio it's in is gorgeous.   So speaking of gorgeous, that's what this place is. The colors on the outside and inside within the studio and the entry walls are so bright and colorful. It makes you want to get moving. The studio where zumba and other classes are held is amazing. The bright paint, the new floors and the windows looking outside can't be very old. There is a brand new gym with a basketball court that is phenomenal.    Standard gym equipment applies, but is very well kept. After a few weeks, I have still yet to see one that is out of order. The gym area is packed with treadmills, ellipticals,standard weight machines and free weights also, and always seems to be packed. That is the one slight downfall. Sometimes you will have to wait if you want to use a treadmill or elliptical. However, I've never had to wait long and come on, pick up a pair of weights or something. Or use the amazing rock climbing treadmill wall thing they have. This YMCA also has the fitlinxx system that lets you keep track of your progress. Way to go!!  The only downfall so far, is that they haven't had an operational membership card machine since before I started. Therefore, I still have yet to get my membership card which makes it not feel as real. I'm sure the minute I come in with the most terrible workout getup known to mankind, it will magically be fixed. I'll try to do that soon.

IMPORTANT UPDATE! THESE ARE THE BEST BOWLING SHOES EVER. Period.  On my first visit to this place, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised at how new it was. And that the bar was the size of an entire restaurant. And that the restrooms had doors to the alley and to the bar.   I was here on a Saturday night with friends to celebrate a birthday and we got this amazing deal for two hours of bowling and shoes for $10. The place was nearly empty (I think because it was probably between leagues and disco/glow/whatever you wanna call it bowling) and completely pristine. The staff was courteous and we had a blast.   I still wish that bowling system interfaces weren't so damn unfriendly, but that is hardly a situation unique to this alley.  One thing that was sad was that we really wanted the glow bowling to start early because no one was there but us and we were excited. In fact, 40 minutes before it was slated to start, they put down the projectors in front of the lanes and started some of the spot lights but didn't start the music videos or dim the lights. When I approached them to ask if we could possibly start it early, they said no. I then inquired as to why everything was 3/4 set up then, and they said, they do it slowly at set times. BORING. I understand if you're busy. But no one was there but our two lanes and one lane that just joined beside us. Out of like 30 something lanes (I'm guessing). For that I will knock you down a star. Don't act like it's a chore to answer my question.

Oh how I wished Walt's had better hours. With that being said though, that's the only thing sad about Walt's.   It's like your little friendly neighborhood hardware store. I've gone to grab paint swatches. I've gone to have keys made. I've gone to pick up caulk last minute. You name it, I've been able to grab it at Walt's and everyone is always sure where everything is when you aren't. It's almost like if you were to walk into a grocery store and hand someone your list and they walk you through in the most efficient way possible. It's that awesome.   Through Walt's I've learned that stud finders are in locked cabinets. I never would've known that :) Those studs... They're dangerous I tell you.

I love this Gamestop! I've been here on a few occasions and the staff has always been nice and helpful. There's never any chaos or screaming kids or rude employees.   On my most recent visit, one of the staff members was exceptionally nice. She helped me find everything I needed, found two items they didn't think they had and called a few stores to check on one game the impulse buyer in me wanted to have them hold their last copy for me.

love. Love. LOVE.  How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me. It's like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano. And that's exactly what a music store should be. It should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesn't exist.   First and foremost, the staff is extremely friendly, both on the phone and in person. I've spent I don't know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and they've always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads. It's just an awesome amazing experience.   They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end. I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument, and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.  Go to Milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be.

I know it's a chain, but I can't help but love this place. I recently visited for a lunch break this week and it really was fantastic. I can't comment on the indoor atmosphere or anything as I was unable to get past the peacefulness of the outdoor patio I came across first.   It wasn't very busy and the service was fantastic. We were promptly greeted by our server who didn't seem to mind that it took us 35 minutes or so to even decide on a drink let alone our meal and dessert. He patiently came back and checked on us every so often when he saw we were having a break in our conversation. I was appreciative he didn't constantly stalk us every 2 minutes.   The food was absolutely delicious and came out with perfect timing for each course. We started off with the sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer which was delicious and the perfect size for two of us. Just as we were about finished, our sushi came out. I ordered the las vegas roll, which really hit the spot that day. Just the right amount of food. Lastly, we decided to share the carmelized apple crisp. Mmmmmm. Delicious. We were only able to eat a little more than half of it, which makes me think the individual one might actually work for two people. I'm picky when it comes to baked apples, and this was truly decadent. I also had the pina cojito while I was there which was just a gorgeous work of art in a glass and had the freshest pineapple along with it. I'm glad I don't know how to make those.   In the end, although it's a chain, this is a place i'd come back to. I've yet to try the Macadamia Nut Chicken.

A friend and I visited Malee's on Main a few weeks ago on a whim after ending up in Scottsdale. I greatly enjoy Thai and absolutely expect good atomosphere in a place as well and I got that at Malee's.   The atmosphere was better than expected. I loved the lighting (or slight lack thereof) and the different booths and tables available. My only complaint was that there happened to be a girl playing piano while we were there, but not knowing this when we arrived, we were seated in an area where we couldn't hear her at all.  The staff was very attentive and I was constantly having my water refilled without even gesturing that I needed it. This was perfect because the heat and spice of the food was exactly what I wanted :)  The unique names of the menu items were fantastic also and I kinda giggled a little bit (and still do). I had an appetizer of Siamese Kisses and a main course titled Evil Jungle Princess.   I'd definitely go back here again. It was a great experience.

I have to agree with another Yelper that this is one of the only clubs I like in Scottsdale. Ended up here randomly one night while a few friends and I were in the area and low and behold. LIVE MUSIC!!!!! You can't get much better than live music.   Drinks are a little overpriced and I've seen the cover occasionally be rather high, which is typical of Scottsdale, but still not fun for me.   The dance floor is fairly decent sized and people actually dance. I've seen Saturday nights get a little packed but there still seems to be plenty of room to see the band and dance. There are other areas separated from the stage and dance floor if you just want to relax. I highly recommend the outside patio for that, which is wonderful!   The crowd isn't so bad either. It's actually pretty tolerable. Way to go Martini Ranch!

Every single thing, down to the smallest detail was so wonderful at Totties that I could give nothing less than 5 stars. I was in the area with a friend to see a band play and remembered someone mentioning they liked Totties. After the show, we hopped in to see what it was all about. The restaurant smelled intoxicating. If that wasn't enough the decor wooed me in the rest of the way. We were seated promptly and given menus to review.   One of my favorite things off the bat was that our waitress Naomi didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, she asked if we wanted anything aside from water. I liked knowing that either way, I was getting something while I made a decision on dinner.   And, well, that was a pretty hard decision. The menu has countless items I am still craving now after reading them hours before. I ended up having the red salmon curry, which was accompanied by sticky rice and steamed zucchini, broccoli, sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. It was so phenomenal that half of me was sad I was unable to finish it all but the other half was excited my taste buds would get to experience it for lunch tomorrow.   The service was truly top notch and everything was prompt and genuine. From our server to the owner, I can do nothing but compliment them repeatedly. That alone makes me anxious to return. You don't see this level of service much these days.  If you want a nice, quiet, gorgeous, friendly, and inexpensive place to eat, you will definitely find a home at Totties.  PS.. At some point, walk past the bar and check out the sweet as optical illusion mirror!!

Carlsbad is truly one of my favorite places in the valley, although I usually only get the opportunity to go for lunch. This place also holds a special place in my heart because it was my first real meal in Arizona. This is where I went to lunch on my first trip out here for an interview. It's also a favorite place for my coworkers and I to visit.   First things first. The atmosphere is fantastic. The inside and outside both have great seating and I love the welcome feel you get when you arrive from both the staff and the decor. The outdoor seating area is one of the best I've ever seen. If you've never sat in between the outdoor bar and the pond, you are truly missing out.   The food is always fantastic, well portioned, and well priced. Blue corn enchiladas are one of my favorites. Warning though, do not eat them if you are not a fan of cheese. I, however, live for cheese and am in love with them. The lunch specials they have are *always* incredible and definitely worth trying. I don't know anyone that's ever been disappointed by them. Last time I was there it was roasted chicken enchiladas with a mushroom cream sauce. Can I say please eat me now?  If you enjoy fantastic food, amazingly personable staff, and a great setting, this is a must!

I have to say that while the band I saw at Prankster Too's Jester Room was fantastic, the venue I was not all that fond of. Mind you, I can only really comment on the Jester Room as that is where I spent my entire visit.  I think my biggest issue was the layout. It's longer than wider, which isn't really appropriate for a music venue. While we decided to grab bar chairs and move ourselves up in the middle of it, I'm sure people in the bad could not see the band at all. In my opinion, that ruins a small intimate show.   Additionally, the service was slow. The waitresses seemed to get confused and it took us a good half hour after we sat down before anyone stopped by to see if we would like anything.   I'd go there if the band was worthwhile, but that is pretty much it.

Does anyone even go to a dive bar to get spectacular service? Even when it's empty? Nope.  What do you go here for? People watching. Relaxing. Chatting with some friends. Chatting with some random strangers. Having a brew while you're at it.   All of these things I can do at Coach House. All of these things I love doing at Coach House.  Outdoors is by far my favorite place to sit. I feel here is where people watching is at its finest and the true dive bar comes out. It's also where the bouncers have been when I've came by at night... and they have some awesome stories to share themselves.   Sure you will smell cigarettes. Sure your heels may stick to the screwdriver and PBR laced floor. But why are you wearing heels to begin with? And sure, you may feel like you need a hazmat shower when you leave, but that's all part of the fun.

Meh truly is the best rating for my experience at Pasta Brioni.   I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited.   The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.  We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice.   For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.  My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast!   My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular.   Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful.   Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.

The only time I will ever return here is to buy simple accessories I am knowledgeable on and can put on my bike myself. Or to get the hot pink I'm with Awesome socks I love.   That's about the extent of it.  I've been here on two occasions. The first was to start my bike search. When I informed a store employee of what I was going to use my bike for and ask what bikes may suit my needs, I was only shown one row of bikes that were pretty much all the same and all by the SAME manufacturer. I was told that was all they could offer me out of the tons of other bikes they had in their store.  The second time I biked there with a friend on my new bike, Lady Eleanor herself as a friend had some questions about her bike. They were fairly good at answering her questions. However, I was appalled when they stopped me dead in my tracks and asked me what was wrong with my bike. I panicked for only a short while til I realized they were going overboard on the fact that my pedals are not where most pedals are since my bike doesn't have much of a frame in the center. The employee kept going on about how it must be awkward to pedal (which it's not) and then called other employees over to gawk and make odd comments about my bike.   Funny enough on the way out a woman drooled over my gorgeous bike with its interesting design and asked where I got it. I politely told her where.. and it wasn't at Landis.

It's a bar. There's food (appetizers). There's one of the best selections of craft brews both to have there *and* take home in the valley. Hands down. You cannot live here without visiting Papago.  They get me every time. It all starts with a stop in for a beer with a few people after work or on the weekend and turns into taking a hand picked variety 6-pack home with me.   The variety they have on tap in addition to the crazy big variety they have in bottles is enough to make any craft brew lover go into instant shock. The staff is usually very friendly also and attentive to empty glasses.   I believe they have a small stack of board games, though I have never played any as of yet and a fantastic juke box. The atmosphere is extremely casual/laid back and you will do nothing but relax and be in craft brew nirvana when you go.

The only thing I hate about this place is how many times I should be going there for lunch and forget about it.   We've ordered takeout here for work on several occasions, and just recently I was able to eat at Defalco's for the first time. What I've realized? The line is absolutely well worth it. I've tried to order a different sandwich every time and every time it's been just as amazing as the last, if not better.  I love how the line goes through the store, allowing you to see all the wines, beer options, foods you can buy and the deli section in slow motion before you make it to the counter. Next time I am definitely getting the German potato salad!  Two minor issues I had with eating in last time: 1)  One of the displayed beers, a microbrew I look forward to every year, wasn't actually available. 2) Upon going up to the counter to get a refill on my beverage the man taking orders was very upset. He told me the people in the line were gonna come after me. And I'll stop there. I think this took longer than actually refilling my drink.

The short summary? I now officially love FLW and the tour I took convinced me to get a membership the next time I go back.   Two friends and I wandered here a few months ago to get our culture on. We took the 90 minute guided tour I believe. Everything was so gorgeous and our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable. He was able to not just preach at us with lines he'd rehearsed over and over again, but tell a story and show how this knowledge applies to life today.   We were able to take pictures during this tour which doesn't happen in a lot of museums these days and I took everything i could until my camera died.   I left feeling completely inspired and awaiting my next visit.

I have to say I have been to Four Peaks probably at least 15 times in the past 10 months I've lived in Phoenix. That's pretty bad. But also shows how awesome Four Peaks is.   First off, the beer is fantastic. I love several of their brews, specifically the Peach Ale and Hop Knot. If there's a seasonal out at the time, try it. Even if it's not your style, you will appreciate how well crafted it is.   The food is never bad. Never. I've had pizza, beer bread, burgers, appetizers, and wings and they have never let me down. It's probably some of the best pub food I've ever had. The fries are to die for. If you want a great appetizer for a group, go for the spinach dip. I swear the dish it comes in never goes empty and I'm not really joking. I once ordered one as my dinner, quickly became full and offered some to about 12 friends and we only were able to finish half.   The place is insanely huge too. Lots of different areas to sit depending on your mood and all of them are great spots. I prefer the little covered patio area off to the side the best.   It's true the Four Peaks is always busy, but I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes to be seated, even with a group of 7. Their service has never suffered with a crowded house.

Yum! This place hit the spot last night. I had dinner plans with a friend and we were both craving something flavorful as usual, and also wanted to go somewhere we haven't been. Scared of encountering yet another lackluster Thai restaurant we decided to try Cafe Lalibela and convinced two other friends to go with us. I haven't had Ethiopian in awhile and it was like experiencing it all over again.   The inside was small and quaint... and packed! However, after being told we'd have a 20 minute wait, we only had about 7, which was great because the smell in the place was exquisite and was starting to make my stomach sing.   The four of us ordered the Lalibela Exclusive with the addition of an order of the Asa Wat, which was fish. I had a glass of Ethiopian honey wine to go with it. It was incredible. I was so glad we added the fish because that was by far my favorite, followed by the spicy beef. The cabbage and potatoes was pretty delicious too, though I didn't really find one thing I didn't care for. It was very flavorful and the injera was the perfect addition. The wine was great also.   The service was pretty slow, which became an issue with us wanting to hit up sweet republic after and we had to hunt down our check ourselves. It wasn't enough that I wouldn't go back again though. And again. And again.

Sit down and prepare yourself as I tell you something that will change your life.   Ready?  Caffe Boa's brunch is the best in Phoenix. Hands down. I'm also making this claim without having ever been past the patio. If you don't believe me, check out the amazing photos I added.  The patio is so gorgeous and serene you don't even realize you're right down smack dab in the middle of college central. The vines growing along the side and the umbrellas suspended from the roof are simply magnificent. The place settings are beautiful, and listening to the birds tweet as they hop around all while a great breeze blows makes it instantly calming enough to warrant going by yourself, serene enough for talking business, and sexy enough for a date.   The staff is phenomenal, and our server, Bri, was just the best ever. She helped me through some very tough Sunday morning meal decisions as well as explained all about Caffe Boa and how many of their items on their dinner and new brunch menu are made from scratch, organic, and/or locally grown. The brunch menu also has only been around a few weeks. I'm glad that I stopped by before word spreads.  I started off with the white sangria, which wasn't sold by the glass until brunch. Additionally, during brunch, the pitchers of sangria are half off. The glass was huge and full of flavor and goodness. It was filled with apples, grapes, oranges, and cherries and was absolutely delightful. After the sangria, I had to try the mimosa, and I was not disappointed. Mimosas, Bellini, and champagne are 8 per glass or 18 bottomless at brunch. And yes, you can mix and match them. It may sound a little pricey, but they would kick the ass of the 2 dollar mimosas many places have. Total weaklings they are compared to this masterpiece.  After going round and round on just what I wanted to order, I settled on the eggs benedict which had prosciutto, poached eggs, and basil hollandaise over an English muffin. On the side was an amazing goat cheese and tomato (though I did without tomato). I added some cracked pepper and unbleached wine rock salt. Decadent. Simply exquisite. I don't typically care for salt and I couldn't help but keep putting a tiny pinch on my meal.   The service was just the right speed for a brunch, not too fast and not too slow. I don't like to be rushed on a Sunday morning. I was able to enjoy myself and take in the amazing food I was eating as well as enjoy the scenery, which made me believe I really had been transported to a gorgeous countryside when I walked in the door.   I will gladly come here again for brunch, and despite my typical dislike of pasta, the description Bri gave us, has me craving that as well.  It was decadent down to every last tiny detail and I left completely satisfied from head to toe, like I had been on a romantic getaway or a day at the spa.

I have been visiting Altered Ego Salon & Spa for my nails, hair, eyebrows as long as I've lived in the area. I found it on a whim and decided to walk in and check the place out. This is also how I found my second home, Solo Cafe, which is attached. I have never been disappointed by any of the services I have had done.   Altered Ego's atmosphere makes you instantly comfortable. The decor is gorgeous throughout the entire establishment. The staff is very friendly and always makes sure you are satisfied. The front of the store has a boutique area with unique clothing and handmade jewelry and accessories. I have bought a few dresses from them and they have ended up being my favorites and reasonably priced.  Danielle does my eyebrows and she's fantastic. The waxing/skin care room is so relaxing. The table is extremely comfortable and the low lighting is perfect. She's very attentive and makes sure everything is done exactly as I'd like and that I won't have a reaction to anything she uses.   Tiffany has done my nails on several occasions. She's very precise and does several types including gel wraps. Additionally, she does nail art. Having a paraffin wax done at the same time is a fantastic bonus. If you've never had a paraffin wax, you are definitely missing out. Go . Have. One. Now.  Last but not least in any way is Laura who does my hair. How fantastic is she. I think I scared her the first time I came in and asked for violet and blond, but I really expect this to happen everywhere I go. I tend to go a little overboard with my hair (especially with coloring) and I expect for salons to expect normal customers. I appreciate this though, as she truly made sure it was what I wanted before she made such a drastic change to my hair. Now, not much surprises her with me, and sometimes she even suggests something more drastic than I am thinking. I love that she has gotten to know me and can remember my likes and dislikes and assist me in making the best decision as to what will look good on me. I am not a hair stylist and it's that help that I value the most.  All in all this place is fabulous and you won't be disappointed. If you need any more convincing, I've ordered coffee from Solo.  From my salon chair.

After having a pampering day, I feel compelled to update my review to include the new awesome I have experienced.   In addition to brow waxing, Danielle's facials are amazing. I recently came back from a 4 month trip that was camping for the most part and she did wonders to help revitalize my face and take away any damage the setting had done. She asked me questions to help determine what the best procedure was for me and made the entire session relaxing and comfortable. This will certainly not be my last facial.   Tiffany was very patient when it came to my return pedicure. After four months of hiking boots and socks ALL. THE. TIME. .. well except for the shower when I got to wear wonderful flip flops, my feet were a pure disaster zone. I will spare you the horrid detail. It was bad. I was actually a little embarrassed, even though I knew it was typical. I walked out of there a million times better!   Finally, I came back surprised to find my stylist had left, and scheduled an appointment with Ashley, whom I was told would not be afraid of my sometimes interesting hair decisions. She was fantastic!! Rather than try to reign me in, she helped set me free and even showed me a natural vegan product line to help put the natural curl in my hair. Everything she did was pure magic and I would recommend her in a heartbeat. I am totally in love with my hair!

Walking into Fry's Electronics is like walking into the Costco in Idiocracy. It's overwhelming on top of being poorly organized which is not a good experience. The labeling and wayfinding is a disaster and when you need to figure out which of the 10 sections something could possibly belong in (but is only in one) you stand in line for ages trying to get some type of assistance.  The first time I ever attempted to go there I found some great things, but not at reasonable prices. When I headed to checkout I wanted to scream. What a horrible checkout procedure. The lines are long for not reason other than you have to wait for someone to tell you what line to go to. It's like constantly buying things from Best Buy at Christmas.  Recently I've been on the hunt for a backup for my netbook similar to a battery backup you use for travel with a cell phone or laptop. It's been hard to find something with the same tip. My first try, I was directed to two items. I tried one, which was wrong.   Today I came back to return it and try again. I was the only person in the return line with four people working and it took me 10 minutes to even be able to speak with an employee. It then took another 10 minutes to return my one item. After that disaster was finally over, I headed to find another replacement. I decided to ask an employee if they knew of any with the small netbook tip. I was directed to the iGos which is what I tried last time. I informed them that I tried a different iGo package last time and the "netbook" tip didn't work. I asked if they knew of anything else. They just looked at me and said "no. do you need help with anything else" as they walked away.  I attempted to try the other iGo package they suggested but as I found out when I came home, it once again, does not work. Not that they'd care.  I'm sorry. I really hate to give 1's, but I just cannot say one good thing about this store. I've resorted to it a few times since it's close to my house and everyone says it should have all the random odd things I am looking for and at a fairly reasonable price. This has not been my experience at all. In fact, of the 4 times I have been here, I have never walked out a happy customer.

This is Vegas. Screw the strip, which just reminds me of Scottsdale. Fremont Street is amazing and the Golden Nugget is the best on the old strip.   I spent a weekend here for my 30th birthday and was far from disappointed. My suite was in the newly renovated Rush Tower, which is sexy and exquisite. The staff was excellent, the room was great and the bed was insanely comfortable.   There's some decent restaurants within the hotel, such as the Chart House and the Sushi joint near the Rush Tower.   Also, um shark tank in the pool and a slide that goes through the shark tank?  Yes please. The pool is hard to get into, but that's most resorts in Vegas. Needless to say though, we still found spots without paying or making reservations and had a great time. The key in the pool is to hang out in the tunnel part behind the shark tank :)

I headed to the Warhol on a weekday afternoon while on business in Pittsburgh. I was looking to get my culture on before heading on an afternoon flight back home.   The museum was much larger than I expected and well worth the admission price. The pinball gallery in the entry is fantastic and I found myself singing Pinball Wizard as I walked out at the end of my stay.   The exhibits were all interesting and I could have stayed there well longer than I had time to if I watched all the video exhibits from start to finish. The way the exhibits were set up made sense and were easy to comprehend and enjoy without a lot of reading tiny chapters of books hung to a wall. Some of the exhibits were also hands on and more of an interaction than a viewing. Balloons in the air, interesting entrance ways and music. They also did a great job of setting up the vibe in each separate area.   The gift shop didn't have as much Warhol stuff as just goofy stuff you would find in Spencer's. That and the parking situation disappointed me.

Abridged:  I'm gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.  Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again.   I've been worried about writing this for awhile (it's been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions haven't changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, I'd probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing. Thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there.

Okay Lux, I can move you up a star. I'm still not a fan that most of the time it's hard to find a seat and have it be quiet enough to focus on anything. Additionally, I am sad that my favorite shoe chair that was an important part of an evening I had with Tony A. seems to no longer be there.  However, when I came back this past Saturday for a velvet with your homemade whipped cream, you truly delivered. It was the perfect temperature and a million times better than the last one I remembered. Bravo. Now move closer to my house and we'll be all set.

I'm a fan of the Los Dos!!! A lot. A lot. A lot!!!   If I have a friend in from out of town and they want a good representation of Mexican food and atmosphere here, this is where we head to. The building is just beautiful, and when you walk in to see the patio area, I don't know anyone that could not fall in love with it's complete randomness that somehow matches perfectly. The statue of liberty, the fountain, the old bicycle.. it's briliant!!  The food is also incredible. I crave the salsa constantly and the sopapillas are a force to be reckoned with. So far I've had the carnitas and the adovada and love it. I like that Los Dos isn't afraid of spice and doesn't wimp out for it's customers. It's authentic Mexican, take it or leave it.  I've had a good time here both with small and large groups though with a large group our orders got all confused as it was hard to hear the orders the server was shouting and they were just set down anywhere. However, it will not stop me from a return.

They offer celebration champagne. Ya know.. with the colored sugar crystals. Kinda like Rainbow Brite's star sprinkles. But for grownups. The girlie girl in me squealed like a little piglet in delight :)  While I've had one meh dish here, I've had far more awesome ones. I'm sure I don't have to mention that this is indeed one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches I've ever had, and the same is probably true for most. It's messy. It's spicy. It's hot. It's goodness. The perfect amount of flavor and kick and enough to make you just full enough.   Oh? You need more proof? The waffle fries are out of this world. Waffle fries are one of my favorites in the fry family and the ones at AZ88 do not disappoint. Not too undercooked. Not burnt. Just right. They'll also help take the edge off the sandwich for those of you that could use that.  I've also really enjoyed the picnic chicken sandwich, which is enough to feet multiple people for a picnic. The sandwich is light and summery and there's lots of yummy fruit on the side. I feel like I should be in one of those hidden valley ranch commercials out on the rolling hills with the trees when I'm eating it.  The service is pretty average but nothing extraordinary. The place is swanky though and the bar is fully stocked. With reasonable prices, great food and swanky decor, this is an all around win if you are looking to impress.. others or just yourself!!

De. Lish. Us.   Delux was one of the first restaurants I went to upon moving to Phoenix and I have gone back a few times since, mainly at lunch during the work week. It's my favorite burger spot.   The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.  The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce.   Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also.   I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.  It's a bit on the pricey side, and you typically are going to have to wait awhile and/or be cramped, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth checking out.

If it hadn't been for the recommendation of a local when they heard I was heading to the Warhol, I never would've known about this place, and my life would not be as complete as it was now. Simply put, everyone needs to visit the Mattress Factory.   It's very inexpensive and well worth it. You're also allowed to take photos throughout. The staff is very friendly and the gift shop is great. Only downside to the gift shop is they didn't have a shirt in the size I wanted. I requested to be notified when it came in, and here a few months later, I've still heard nothing.  However, the exhibits make up for it. They are very unique not only in the aspect that you won't find them anywhere else, but the mediums are of a large variety. The day I went I was able to go to both buildings. The first one had a lot of wooden and metal exhibits as well as a floor that was completely dark and had some light exhibits. When you get off the elevator it is pitch black with only a spotlight over a plaque on the wall informing the visitors how to get into the rooms.   The second building had amazing art work in the way of room decor which was great to see.   Fantastic. Must see!

Last night I met up with a few friends at FEZ. It was due to the fact that we wanted to go somewhere centrally located for all of us and I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions. I had never been there before and wasn't sure what to expect. I walked out extremely impressed.   The interior design is pretty damn cute. It's brightly colored and dimly lit which made me happy. Orange table top? Yes please.   My friends had already ordered a phylo dough appetizer by the time I got there that had grilled chicken, spinach and some other amazing thing in it with red pepper aoli. I could've eaten this all night. It was so soft and even though I knew what was in it, it was a delightful taste that was better than I expected.   The pomegranate fusion I had to drink was pretty delish. A juicy orange was prettily sitting atop of it too. It caught me off guard as being a little strong, but in a good way. Not in a, I really feel like I'm drinking rubbing alcohol kind of way.   While the special of the day sounded o tempting and is usually what I like to try at an establishment, I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it. Instead I ordered a chicken sandwich (cannot believe I forget the name) that had grilled chicken, greens, pears, dried cherries, and a pomegranate vinaigrette with a side of sweet potato fries. As it was I could only stomach about half of it even though my taste buds wanted me to finish every last bit of that sandwich. I think I could eat that every day. The sweet potato fries were good, but I have to admit I think I like delux's better.   While the staff was attentive, we were one of two tables there due to it being almost closing so I can't validate how the staff is on a typical day.   So much of the menu looked fantastic, and I will definitely be back.

Dear FEZ,  We have courted on several occasions. At first I thought maybe we were destined to be casual flings forever. I loved your eclectic style mixed with your sensuality. I've always loved that you filled your delicious martinis to the brim, but in the back of my head thought you were always just trying to get me drunk. Your menu begs me to keep coming back for more whenever I get the chance.  However, you went above and beyond the other night, and it's all thanks to your delightful server Candace. She is a diamond in the rough and needs to be given a handsome bonus or raise. Do not reward her with vacation though, as I expect her schedule to follow my FEZ cravings from here on out :)  From the get go, my crew of out of towners were suspicious they would not receive their food in time to enjoy it, not be rushed, and be able to make their flights back home. I was selfish and wanted to show them the best restaurant not in walking distance from the hotel and bussed them on the light rail to FEZ.  We informed the staff of our situation and apologized in advance. And we experienced the best service I have ever had probably anywhere in the valley. Our waters were delivered promptly (but without bendie straws.. slight sad face) and we ordered immediately after. Candace never minded repeating the drink menu items as we didn't have but one of those menus on the table for all 10 of us.   Our food came out quickly and all at the same time. Drinks were delivered with flair. Everyone spent the first few minutes moaning in happiness. Following it were a few moments of extreme gratitude for the delicious food and then a lot more silence as we devoured our meals without feeling like we were in a hurry any longer.   The bills were brought out.. separate... to everyone right as some of us were about finished and needed to start thinking about a ride to the airport. It was beautiful. Despite gratuity being included, I believe we all included extra because we truly appreciated our service and meals that night.  In fact, I can never finish my fries and FEZ burger so I had half sitting there and one of my friends asked if they could have some of it as it was so delicious the first time he had it.  I love you FEZ, and I always will. You truly impressed me all over again, and left a great impression of what Phoenix has to offer on visitors.

As much as I get disappointed when I have to give 2 stars, I always find that the description states it so well. There's no better word to describe this than meh.  I went with high hopes on a Smunch day, having never been and expecting some pretty damn good food. We were able to push all the tables out front together (well, okay, I'll give credit where it's due.. they did this for us) to accommodate our group. And that's where the good stuff ends.  I highly doubt that I was just grumpy that day, because I'm never grumpy on Smunch day, but the prices seemed a little extreme for the amount and quality of food. I don't even remember exactly what I got, which nearly never happens. I just remember having sad face when I finished. Not because it was over.. .but because it was over so soon.. and with so little flair.  The real issue came with our check. No separate checks was an absolute nightmare and they wouldn't even help us figure out how much of the tax was ours etc etc... and I looked borderline annoyed when we weren't figuring it out fast enough. I had to use a calculator people. For real.  Maybe it was the crowd that did the trick, but they knew in advance we were coming. At least a week in advance. If they couldn't handle it, all they had to say was no.

A few friends and I visited Carly's on a whim one night while out for the art walk. I had never been there before nor remember specifically seeing it while in Phoenix, so from the description we had in a brochure we were expecting something else. I'm not sure I was really upset about it, and I didn't mind the charm once I got there, but I was a little disappointed and I could tell some of my friends were too.  Yes the service is slow and not necessarily the best. However, at least in my opinion, I expected this the minute I walked in and scoped the place out.  I ordered the pear panini and an orange mojito. The pear panini was extremely delicious. There have been a few occasions since where I've thought of trying to imitate it at home. My orange mojito didn't taste very orange but in the end it wasn't worth asking for another one with the speed of service.   All in all it's a decent place if you're prepared for what you are going to get and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again, I did really enjoy that pear panini.

If I'm a fan of a pasta place, you know it's pretty much awesome. Especially if I'd go there again.   The atmosphere is awesome and the whole vibe of the restaurant is very relaxing but in an elegant, royal, sexy way. The gorgeous reds mixed with copper make me swoon. Enter a gorgeous waiter and I might try to live there.   Both times I have been at Bada Boom I have had fantastic food. It was prepared well, presented well, and served within a reasonable amount of time. There are always several items on the menu I am dying to try, which says a lot as I don't like tomatoes or red sauce all that much.   On one occasion I was there, it was a little rowdy at the bar area, but fortunately the main dining area is completely separated by the courtyard entrance and is not a distraction at all.

Copper Star is where I go to buy drip coffee to make at home. And where I meet up for coffee on weekends and evenings with friends. When you can find parking (though I prefer walking or biking), the atmosphere there is so relaxed you can't help but sit and unwind for a few.  Their non-coffee items are just as delicious, from the italian sodas (with choice of regular or heavy cream) to the delicious desserts and baked goods (which usually even have a vegan option), keep me coming back.   Parking is limited, and I've never been through the drive though as it looks awkward, but this is still a place you don't want to miss out on.

Why the hell did no one drag me to Ticoz before now? Seriously, you all call yourselves my friends? I'm disappointed and saddened everyone kept this secret to themselves.  As usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.  Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.  I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.  Stepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.  I adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again. Now.

I love you American Apparel. Where else can I walk into an establishment and feel like I've walked into the 80s, my grandma's closet, Lady Gaga's closet, and a raunchy hooker store yet feel completely at home and in love with all the clothing??? Nowhere. Well, except maybe my closet after I finish buying all your wares.   During my most recent trip I found the most fantastic item I think I've purchased to date.... fluorescent pink corduroy shorts... yes... as bright as the sun and absolutely beautiful. From the tights to the shorts to the oxford shirts, this place is the awesome.

Disgusting.  Have you ever experienced a time where you are just craving sushi, so much that even a philadelphia roll platter would do? If so, have you ever been so revolted you couldn't finish the roll?  I hope you haven't. This was my first experience with that and I was left heartbroken and sad and wishing I had never decided to give this place a chance.   While the decor is amazing, the menu looks unique and spectacular and even the rolls looked amazingly tempting when I brought them home, the love affair stops there. It's all superficial, and I don't date that type.

Seems that a lot of negative reviews of the Clarendon come from never having experienced all that is the Clarendon. I've been there on several occasions and never had a bad time. This past weekend was the first time I stayed there, and it was complimentary thanks to the gift certificates I received when I attended their Snow Ball New Years Eve party at the beginning of this year.  First off, the decor should be enough to sweep you off your feet. The lobby is exquisite and I want that wall treatment in my next house. The rooms are well thought out and modern and stylish. When you first enter, the lights are on for you, and soothing instrumental music is playing from the alarm clock. That right there was enough to make me want to fall asleep. Then I made the mistake of laying on the bed. I have to revoke my claim that I have the worlds comfiest bed. This bed was so seductive that I went to bed at 10:30 that first Friday night. Yes you heard me. 10:30. Lights out for Tonia.  I enjoyed having Gallo Blanco right in the same building as well as the rooftop bar, which made for a great Saturday night. When I left Sunday morning, for some reason my 2nd night was charged to my account, but Matthew, who was working the front desk carefully went through and corrected the situation for me. He was awesome.  My only complaint about the Clarendon is that I'd love to see some cute glassware instead of the disposable cups in the rooms. Also, being that it's an old building, despite having four or five routers for guests, I was never able to get a wireless signal, and was told by the front desk they barely get one either. There should be some way to make that work.  With reasonably priced, modern, comfortable as hell rooms and a staff that will sweep you off your feet, I'll definitely be back.

It didn't even take longer than 3 minutes into our meal before everyone was thanking me for recommending Cafe Carumba as our lunch venue on Friday. How could I recommend anything else though? It was close to the office, I hadn't been there before, and well, they serve breakfast til 2pm EVERY DAY. There was absolutely nothing disappointing about this experience.   A large group of us gathered there on Friday and when I arrived we had received a room in the back all to ourselves with a long table. It was absolutely perfect. Our server was a true gem. We had waters on our table when we arrived and he put up with our wishy washyness when it came to our orders. I started off with a mimosa that, despite being pulpy, which I typically don't care for, was absolutely enchanting. It came in a wine glass instead of a champagne glass. More is better :)  As it came time to order I couldn't move past the breakfast menu and thought I had settled on the perfect treat. Then I was told by the server there was an underground breakfast menu that included five different types of eggs benedict. Yes you heard me correctly. I did say five. There was the traditional one, one with avocado, one with portabello, one with crab cakes instead of an english muffin, which a coworker got, and the steak one that I decided to try.   When our food first started to arrive we were told it was being brought out as its done so it stays hot. We began to worry that we would be eating without everyone but that worry lasted maybe 45 seconds as instantly the rest of the food was brought out. Silence followed for at least the first 10 minutes aside from messages of thanks and grunts of happiness.  The potatoes are as heavenly as everyone says.. you need to have them. I also recommend the eggs benedict with steak instead of canadian bacon. I typically down my breakfast (ask anyone) but I couldn't finish my last eggs benedict. I did manage to have two mimosas though. Yum.  At the end of the meal, the sever brought me out a foil rose which I've attached and still have. Why can't all men be as sweet?  In the end the food is phenomenal, the mimosas are exquisite and larger than the ones elsewhere, service is prompt and extremely friendly. I will be back again.

Any place that can convince me to try tomatoes in any form wins a prize. And so far, The Roosevelt is only one of like 2 maybe? Three at most. I recently went back when out downtown with a friend recently and after realizing we hadn't eaten yet, decided to try out their menu. So, not only is the beer pretty grand, and the atmosphere lovely (well, only when it's not crowded - I like to go on weeknights), but the grilled cheese and tomato soup is amazing. Yes. You heard it here folks. I'm praising tomatoes for the first time in my life.   When it's not crowded, The Roosevelt is one of my favorite spots. It's like being at a house party before it starts, but not knowing the people. And the house is on a college campus so it's not perfect and not decorated perfect. It has the elements "the ladies like." And let me tell you, if you ever found a need to have 30 people in the bathroom at one time, The Roosevelt fits that requirement too.

Abridged: When you can't figure out how to use a car wash, there's some major issues. When your steering wheel is so greasy you have to go to the first convenience store to grab napkins to clean it before you can safely drive home, it's a no go.  Unabridged: In looking for a new car wash, I found one that I definitely won't be going back to. Upon driving up, I couldn't even figure out how to get my car washed. I had to have an employee walk me through it. What??? This is ridiculous people. I know. I know. I design user interfaces for a living, and I am somewhat pickier than most, but it's still wrong.  Having my car washed on the outside and the interior cleaned (no waxing, detailing or anything special) took over an hour. And I wasn't even really sure why. All I knew was there was no good place to sit and wait while watching at the same time. I was bored. And my car seemed to just sit there.   But what finally put the icing on the cake?  First, the air freshener was put in even though I told them I didn't want one. Secondly, I couldn't even drive my car home. The steering wheel was so greasy from whatever they used to clean it, that I had to pull over and wipe it off before I could safely continue driving home. It took a few days to get all of it off my steering wheel again. Needless to say, I won't be making that mistake again.

I know I know. The rule of thumb is that cool people have dogs. Well, I'm pretty cool. But I am also just a me. And I also have a job. And I also volunteer. Which means I also don't have the time a dog deserves. So instead I have cat dogs. They may look like cats, but please don't let that fool you. I have dogs that use a litter box and that can jump fences. And that fetch. And that always want to play.   I also have cats that can find nearly nothing of interest in wag n' wash. Even though they mention having cat supplies. And even though there's a cat in the store. And even though my cats wag their tails.  Probably great for dogs. But not cats.

With a friend and I craving sushi, and being in the area of Yasu, we decided to give it a try on a weekday night. Having never been there before, I was drawn in by the atmosphere inside. We sat by the sushi bar, which wasn't very big and therefore felt kinda awkward, like a table facing the corner used for Kindergarten time outs.   The service was a little disoraganized and I have to admit it wasn't the best rainbow roll I've ever had.  Was hoping for another sushi joint to add to the list, but not sure this will be it.

I have to say that overall, in the years I've been flying US Air, it's been a pleasant experience. Sure, they may charge you for bags and they may not be as fun and hip as Southwest, but I've had far more issues with canceled and delayed flights without any updates on the few times I've flown SW than the millions of times I've flown US Air. Delays and cancellations have been next to nothing, and when they happen, I've been very well accommodated for my troubles.

I heart HTC! I first went on a recommendation from a friend when I was in one of those random "I want a piercing" moods. I was so relieved to find a place that had a variety of jewelry at the counter, was well kept, and had a staff that really knew their stuff.   I was extremely pleased with my first piercing and have been back two more times since then. I've never had an issue with any of my piercings and they are glad to help switch jewelry out or fix your nose ring when you have a horrid sneezing accident shortly after having it done.   If you are looking for a quality piercing place, you cannot go wrong.

Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients.   I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me.   As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.  And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings. They still look amazing a week later. I'm still in love, and they are perfectly healthy. Job well done. But I'm not surprised.

Picture it ladies. You have a date the next day and realize you're in desperate need of an eyebrow wax. Unfortunately you have a meeting on the other end of the valley that goes way past spa closing time. In a desperate rush you are searching yelp, trying to find places that have walk-ins available. After two failed attempts, you are running out of time and losing hope. Then you see it. Fuchsia. And it's all pink. You feel like you've possibly discovered the holy effing grail of spas.   Then it ends.  While the waxing was done well and the price was reasonable and about the same as what I pay at my regular joint, the staff made it uncomfortable. There was really no place to sit and wait.. well there was, but it was hidden and I wasn't informed of it, while my room was being prepared. The wax started out fantastic with the typical awkward chat.. but then it got weird.   A huge sales pitch started telling me how I needed all these other services done and made me feel like I would regret it if I didn't. It reminded me of the times I went to the dentist as a child and was told how horrible my teeth were even though they were perfect. I walked out completely weirded out and in a foul mood. Sad face.

One of the first things anyone told me when I was looking to move to Phoenix a year and a half ago was that the light rail was coming and was going to be awesome - a true game changer.   When the light rail opened I rarely rode it at first. The hours sucked and the last thing I wanted was to end up stranded in Phoenix because I refused to leave by 11pm.   Now the weekend hours at least have changed, and while sometimes it still sucks (house parties don't always end at 2am), I mostly like it. I've found myself taking the light rail even more now that I am back from a stint overseas and hating driving my car. In the past week, I've used it four times to make trips downtown for some fun and mischief.   Unfortunately I am only able to use the light rail for recreational reasons as I work in Snottsdale, and they, apparently, aren't fans of the light rail. My only hope is to have it hit farther in Tempe or Mesa that I can take my bike and ride a few miles in after a stop... but I don't think that will happen either. I know that's not really the LR's fault, but it still makes me bitter.  The adventures are fun on the LR and it's actually helped this newby that's terribly unblessed with being navigationally challenged on top of it to navigate the Phoenix area, downtown in particular. I never thought that would happen, and it probably wouldn't have been possible without the help of the light rail.

Until recently I was the duchess of d'lish and it's about time I updated my review to reflect how amazing of a place it truly is.. a diamond in the rough.   Once I first tried the food menu I was insanely hooked. I now have a goal of trying every single thing on it and I'm about half way complete. It's a great place to swing by for breakfast to not only jump start your day with some protein, but to jump start your day with fun. One time a robot took my order!!  Lunch is just as nice. The staff is great while you are there and really appreciate their customers (and they even tell you).  My favorite breakfast has to be the croissant sandwich (with no tomato) and for lunch I've ended up getting the chicken panini more than anything else.   If I'm craving a hot drink it's always a chai latte and for cold it's an arnold palmer with black tea.  If you haven't been here yet, you should go out of your way to swing by!

I wasn't going to write a review for BW3s since we ended up not dining there the evening we stopped in, but I felt compelled to warn others about special event nights there.   We happened to swing by for a birthday gathering when we were informed of the special event night for boxing. The price was going to be $10 a person whether you were watching or not. I get that, and we all understood and then promptly stepped to the side to discuss another place to go.  However, I was extremely dumbfounded when a couple walked in with their infant baby...INFANT BABY and were told the total cost for them to watch the event would be $30 ($10/ea). They seriously *charged* for the INFANT BABY!! Ridiculous. Makes me sad because I really heart BW3s most of the time.

I'm not a pizza fan, and I will always be up for an order from Barros. That's how amazing it is.  First off, ordering on the phone is so simple.  Usually I'm already in the system and I don't need to give them all the crazy address and direction information that I hate repeating every time I call somewhere.  Secondly, their delivery is speedy gonzales quick. I don't know how they do it, but it arrives well before I think it will and is piping hot and fresh.  Third, the prices are reasonable and they aren't afraid to give me food without tomatoes. The dough is fantastic, and it's easily become one of the favorite delivery spots for the crew in my hood!

Do you hear that? The angels singing?   In yet another episode of My Impulsive Life, I was working on rearranging a room and decided to repurpose an old bookshelf as my new storage unit for my bags and hats. When all was finished I decided it needed something more. Fabric as some type of cover and a little bit of class. But I couldn't find anything open nearby and those that were had some really piss poor excuses for fabric collections.  I posted on facebook about my frustration and get a response to try 35th Ave Sew and Vac. I didn't hesitate as I was desperate and in the mood to shop. Having one of the cross streets in the name is a huge help too, let me tell ya. I found the place easily and was excited to get started in my search.  At first it looked like there was a very limited selection of fabric and I started to weep (on the inside, don't worry). Then a skinny hallway and narrow beacon of light directed me to the mecca of fabric. I was lost in no time, wandering about the rows and admiring the selections. They were categorized beautifully and the taxonomy/library science geek in me swooned. Everything was so easy to find.  Finally I made a decision and headed to the checkout. They were so nice and friendly and it was a breeze to pay and make my way home to use my newly found goods. Everyone I encountered seemed really knowledgeable and courteous, which is nice, because I actually don't know a damn thing about sewing except that I can't do it.

I can't believe I've been to this place twice, but when I'm at the Arizona Center for an event, I'm short on time, and I'm hungry, this is actually the best place to get a quick bite.  It's your average takeout pizza/pasta joint, like a mom and pop Sbarro. I've only ever had pizza here as the pasta isn't a quick deal. The sad part is that the last time I was there especially, I didn't even remember eating there shortly after, because I was still hungry. Not very filling.  Also, just a note that if you plan on just grabbing a beer here, and want to pay with a card, there's a $5 min for card transaction. In that situation, either pay with cash, or grab some sun chips, which put it at the minimum level.

Z Pizza is one of the best places I have discovered. Mainly because I don't like tomatoes, and Z is not totally about tomatoes either. There are so many items on their menu I have not been disappointed with, from Pesto pizza to cheesy bread to salad!! All of them tomato free.  The best feature though I have to say is their insanely easy to use online ordering. Being in the user experience industry, I'm frustrated with online ordering 95% of the time. Z makes me happy though. I actually sometimes miss them if I don't order occasionally. You can customize any item with almost anything you can think of and it's very easy to walk through. They also let you know up front if you are too far away for their delivery services so you don't sign up anyway.  I love you. I love you. I love you. And your use of fun ingredients like bacon and pine nuts and mushrooms :)

I went to Benjarong today to meet up with a friend for dinner. I was excited at the opportunity to try another Thai place. This may sound completely odd, but the year and a half I spent in Detroit really increased my Thai snobbery. It's been hard finding a great Thai place here.   The restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall next to a church. The sign is hard to see from the road and I went past it the first time and almost missed it the 2nd time too. However, the inside is very cut and cozy. It's not very large and has a warm and inviting feel.   For an appetizer we had crispy spring rolls, which were pretty much your average spring roll. Not too bad, but nothing fancy or exceptionally spectacular either.  For dinner I decided to try their version of Evil Jungle Princess with medium spice as I usually get. Typically medium ranges from tolerable to almost not tolerable. This time it tasted like they had put absolutely no spice in at all. It wasn't bad and I did bring the rest home to hav tomorrow, but it's not nearly as flavorful as other Thai places I have been to in the past.   The service is good and the prices are very reasonable. They also have an extensive menu. However, the Thai was too Americanized for me.

In today's episode of I Can't Believe I Haven't Yelped That Yet, I get to tell you about my GO TO sushi joint, Hana.  Yes. There's no liquor license. Yes it's BYOB. Most of the time I don't even bring liquor with me and still have the time of my life. That's how truly phenomenal Hana is. Don't go to get wasted. Go to enjoy your meal.   The only items I've had here consist of sushi, so if you're looking for recommendations on cooked food, this is not the review for you.  Now. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a sushi fanatic. It's gone on way too long to just be a phase. The service is great here, the sushi comes out quick, and it will always up the rating of your day by at least 2 points. If you want to get the full effect, sit at the bar.  I've eaten in and ordered out several times and no matter what my food's ready just when it's supposed to be. The nigiri is oh so good. Thinking about it now makes me lean towards Hana tonight. Anyone game? The basic rolls are anything but basic here, all of them made with love.. and fish that want you to enjoy them.   Sadly I admit I was turned off by the specialty rolls my first visit, because they weren't wrapped very tightly and I didn't look very lady-like while eating them. But I've gotten over that. Sometimes I'm not a lady. And they were delicious. I'll deal with it. You should too.  Hana's a small joint. Sometimes there's a little bit of a line. Nevertheless though, it never seems to ever be so crowded anyone gets annoyed. The staff is efficient, and the sushi is worth it.

Really? I could've sworn I had reviewed Snapdragon already. Shame on me. I wasn't looking too much for a new salon when I moved, but after hearing about Snapdragon and passing it several times, I had to give it a try. I clearly remember the day I walked in to discuss an appointment and conveying that I needed someone that was not only good with color, but was okay with non-conventional color. One of the stylists there was actually sad she wasn't available when I was.  When I came in and met Janelle for the first time I knew I was home. She's hilarious and so good at what she does. She's given me the courage and encouragement to add bangs to my look for the first time since I was 8 and to grow my hair longer than I thought would look okay. She's given me recommendations for tattoo artists and we can talk local hangouts and even video games. Not only that but she understands I'm low maintenance/tomboy when it comes to styling my hair in the morning and shows me maintenance that is low-key and fits with the reality of what I will do when I leave the salon.  The vibe is great, the prices are reasonable and it's now the place I call home. Bonus points because the coffee is also pretty amazing. Nothing is done half-assed at Snapdragon.

Oh Yucca. You are the best place I ever discovered on my own. I first came across Yucca when searching for a great karaoke place in Tempe. I ended up finding Rockaroke which has since then been my fix since I have no time for a band.   It's small. It's a total dive bar. The beer is cheap and there's a great list of off the wall beers and I love it!   It's a great place to go and relax and hear some music and you can seriously not beat rockaroke. Karaoke but with a backup band and not that shitty midi file-esque crap? Yeah. Awesome.   If you are going on a night when something good is going on, get there earlier than you planned on going or you won't get a seat. It can also take awhile to get a drink from the bar, but I think that's because it can become really packed there some nights.   I go often and I love it every time.

Wanting a second, but slightly less intense hike, a friend suggested we head to Papago Park in Tempe. This area is filled with trails and hiking and has a nice little side parking lot underneath an overpass so you don't have to park in the dog park/playground area.   I was absolutely amazed to see the Loma Del Rio Ruins, which I had no idea existed. It brought a sense of peacefulness on top of being thought provocative (yeah, I just wanted to use the word provocative). It was wondrous to see the lush green areas, that even though you can't always see the water, give way to its presence.   None of the trails are very long or intense, so they're perfect for beginners or relaxing hikes. Additionally, they have handicapped accessible trails also. What a great addition.  It won't be my go to place, but on windy days such as the one I ventured there on, it made for a great end of the day and incited great conversation.

The topic of Mrs Whites would frequently come up in the office place by a coworker who used to work near there, at the New Times. This past week though it came up quite often, often enough that on Monday, when we were planning our lunch out together for Thursday, we were so hungry by talking about Mrs Whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol' soul food.   I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this place is. It's like walking into Grandma's kitchen and getting all those great meals you used to love and enjoy. My mouth was watering and my stomach was singing before I even had a chance to sit down.   I like that all the meals are the same price. It makes it so much easier. I also like the selection of sides and dishes. The red kool-aid was delicious but not in a mason jar like Lolos.  The staff was very friendly. One of my coworkers was craving ox tail and it started a big discussion between us and our waitress. She mentioned that Mr. Larry might know when it was available again (they were apparently out of it that day) and he even came out to the table to talk to us. My friend also then got his ox tail. I tried it. It's really damn good. I'd probably order it if it was available the next time I came around.  I went for the 3 piece smothered chicken (fried chicken and gravy) and red beans and rice. Wow that is a lot of food. I devoured the chicken fairly quickly. It was delicious. Best friend chicken I've had aside from my Grandma's. The red beans and rice I had to package up and bring home. I had them for dinner tonight and they were just as delicious as I imagined.   I also tasted one bite of the peach cobbler a la mode. Peaches are not one of my favorite fruits but damn did they do it right.   If you haven't been here, it's a definite must. I'm not sure why you're still reading this. Pack up and go. Move it.

What a difference a new location with more space makes. I now kinda feel like I make up reasons to bring my car in so I can cowork at the awesome desk in the new sexy space 180 just moved into. Headlight out? 180 should be able to fix that. I feel like my exhaust pipe may be loose but I may simply be paranoid? 180 can check that for me. I don't like the song on the radio? 180 can fix that (well probably not, but I can still cowork while they amuse me).  The fact that there are more bays also means my typical maintenance gets done so much quicker too. I've been able to get in and out of the shop in an hour or so. And there's space to sit there. And a desk!!!!! A real desk. So I can sit down and be an adult and connect to the VPN and do all that work stuff.   And the rest of the stuff I've always loved has still stayed the same. It's locally owned by and operated by some kick ass women. They always tell me what's going on with my car in a completely no bullshit, non-condescending way. The prices are reasonable. And they are very friendly. Most importantly, they truly care.   Oh and, they're reusable cups they give as presents are amazing and well designed. Love!  So next time your car needs to be looked at, let me know. I'll bring it in for you.

This may be the only big box chain that I can tolerate going into. Probably because they always have everything I need, and things seem to be more my style here and less crazy than others.   Another bonus is that this Target is Super. And close to the light rail. And by close, I mean it is right there.  Last time I walked into Target I ended up buying two pillows for my sofa that *finally* matched my awkwardly awesome accent color in my living room. And Mortal Kombat. Where else can you do that? And don't say Wal-Mart. No one has those damn pillows. No one but Target.   Sometimes Target is funny too. And not just on April Fools Day. One time I saw an item was out of stock, and there was a label near it listing a replacement item, that was in fact, not a replacement item at all. I love catching things like that. You amuse me Target.  So long as you follow the rule to use a basket and not a cart in Target you will walk out with both you and your wallet being happy :)

This place is a navigation disaster that lacks character. Of any kind.  I remember the first time I went to Tempe Marketplace, shortly after moving as it had a lot of things I was needing to pick up to give a sense of home to the new pad. The only thing other than that I remember is that I left so frustrated and mind blown that I needed ice cream therapy stat.   If you're headed to the parking lots near Lucille's and what not to head to the main strip of smaller stores, you will probably find yourself not knowing where to park in order to get to the specific store you are trying to access. You will be way off base from where you guessed you were and end up confused and lost and bitter.   By that point, all you want to do is get the thing you came for and leave as quickly as possible. You're not going to want to stay and shop and browse or sit by the outdoor fireplace (which is on when it's hot out.. WTF).  With that being said, sometimes I still come here. Lucille's is a work favorite. BevMo is a needed stop at times and if I need to run errands at Michaels or Target after work, it's nearby. But those are the only reasons. Tempe Marketplace has become the last place I think of shopping at when I have some time to kill or feel like browsing for a new dress.

On my grand return to the valley, I was craving Mexican. However, by the time my friends and I got around to eating and stopped chatting, we knew there would be a long line at Los Dos, so we swung by Aunt Chiladas. While it was good, it wasn't fantastic, and I'm not sure I'd do it again.  The first foul was getting there and not realizing the entire front area was a bar/bar seating and not places you can order food (speaking of which, why can't you order food at the bar... ugh). We were then thrown with a 50 minute wait for what seemed like a practically empty parking lot. As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing.   After we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion. Interestingly enough when our food came, our waitress brought it out and then just walked away leaving it on the fold out serving tray and not delivering it to our table. The tacos a friend ordered were taunting him horrendously. Mine came with the wrong side dish which meant I had to constantly push it out of the way.   The fried ice cream was good, but not the best I've had.  In the end, this was just a good learning experience...but it was great to be back amongst friends.

Pho Da Lat was a great impromptu lunch decision on a Saturday afternoon when I had an hour or so to kill with a friend. 2pm on a Saturday almost no one was in there, which I like.   We were immediately led to a table and given menus. The staff gave us enough time to look over our menus and think of any questions we wanted to ask in our heads first. When we finally ordered, we decided to try the quail appetizer and then each had questions on dishes. In response to my guest's questions, samples were brought out to try, which I thought was excellent.  I asked their opinion in regard to the best of the spicy flavorful dishes and it was suggested I try the lemongrass chili chicken which I did.   Unfortunately, our food came out and our appetizer was forgotten about. However, the food was plenty and I ended up not even being able to finish it all anyway. The spice was right on par and we both seemed to enjoy our lunch there.   I will be back again, as I found several dishes I wanted to try, which is the key to high rating and return visit with me, and hopefully next time I will try the 40+ advertised wines. All at once you ask? Hmmm... let's see where the night goes...

I've been here twice for lunch on a Friday. Both times I left happy. I would come back again if asked.   First off I love the atmosphere in this place. Such a cute, southern, home-like, relaxing feel. Mismatched lamps FTW!! There's plenty of room on the inside and various different areas to sit in, which makes it interesting each time you visit.   I've never had slow or bad service here. The server my first time there not only was speedy and attentive but as I finished their version of an arnold palmer I was asked if I wanted to try a variation of it next. It was incredible. The food was also amazingly delicious. Their fried pickles are pretty authentic in my opinion. Our waitress this time was just as fantastic. She had a conversation with us, she was extremely knowledgeable and put up with our crazy table.   The barbeque always good. I have had better luck with the garlic mashed potatoes than the mashed sweet potatoes. As far as drinks the Muddy Waters (non-alcoholic) is fantastic as is a drink I had today that actually involved a sweet tea vodka. Unbelievable.  The only downside to Lucille's is that since it's mainly barbeque it has a limited menu.

I had planned on doing a lot of relaxation this weekend, but wouldn't you know, the weather had something else in store, and I couldn't just hole up and avoid the outdoors. Yesterday I wanted a relaxing stroll, but was sick of the city, so I drove on up to Shaw Butte to do a relaxing loop. Parking in this location is limited, and a little awkward (almost slashed my tires through the do not enter section) but it doesn't seem to get as crowded and should suffice.   The entrance has a map of the area and trails you can take. The path was fairly easy to follow and I did manage to stay on a path (tho not always the one I was supposed to be on) at all times. I also managed to get myself back to my car, so that's always a bonus. There were a few others there that had managed to get themselves lost due to unclear path marking, but one look at a map and it's easy to get your bearings straight again.   The path was beautiful. Not completely scenic, as parts still have the road visible, but it was quiet and peaceful and the sky was gorgeous that day. I pretty much had the trail to myself most of the time with everyone pretty evenly spaced out and ended up doing some dance hiking to my iPod without injuring myself on the trail, which speaks to the ease of the hike. Not really any steep parts or loose rock on the loop trail. Perfect for low maintenance hiking days.   It was my first trip, but I don't see it being my last. Seems like there are plenty of trails that start there that would be fun to venture on.

I decided to try Kabuki for lunch one Friday with a small group of people. I have to say if I can help it, I wouldn't go back.   The service was the biggest reason for this. The place was almost completely empty when we arrived, yet the service was horrendous. Our food was not brought out in the order it should've been or even at the same time. Two of us waiting for nearly 25 minutes after the others received their food before we got ours. I feel it would've been longer had we not hounded the few people we saw every chance we got to inquire about the status of our order. Several times I saw our waitress go right past us and avoid eye contact. Hmph.   The food was okay. A vague description of an appetizer left me wanting more. The sushi wasn't the best I had but was by no means horrible. I did finish it because I wanted to and not because I was starving.

And now, the long awaited Kabuki update... to be fair, this update is a combination of several mishaps and events... they all are related to each other, and therefore I felt they needed to be reviewed together.   As I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).  Everyone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.  It all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.  I left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.  Kabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.  This past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there.   We started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were.   We both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.  In the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).  There are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service.

I'm sure those that know me are not surprised my first review is of Solo Cafe. I can say without a doubt that it's pretty much my second home.   I first stumbled across Solo due to it being connected to Altered Ego Salon & Spa, where i was able to order a tasty beverage from my salon chair. The first mocha was heaven and we have been inseparable ever since.   One of my favorite elements of Solo is the atmosphere. It has a feel that is truly all its own. While the furniture and initial look may seem like the typical eclectic coffeehouse, I assure you it is so much more. The cafe has unique and comfortable furniture, games to play, books to read, and free wifi. The lighting is just perfect so that anyone can feel comfortable working yet also take a break and be instantaneously relaxed.  Equally important is their amazing menu and fabulous coffee skills. I can never get enough of the cherry danish and an iced peppermint cream, which is a tea-based beverage. I can also say that they have the best mocha I've had in the Phoenix area to date.   Last but not least is the friendly staff. I love the few moments I catch the place mostly to myself and can enjoy my coffee or tea, break out the macbook to get some work done and have a side conversation about music or whatever else happens to come up.

So, while I'm not really a fan of chains or anything, I have to give Famous Dave's props for making what was turning out to be a birthday outing disaster a pretty damn good success!   The evening was supposed to start out with a trip to BW3s in Mesa (Buffalo Wild Wings for you non midwesterners). However, due to a special event we had to make a last minute decision to head to Famous Daves. At first we were told there would be an hour wait, which was sad. No more than 5 minutes after we seated ourselves at the bar though, our table was ready!! Success!!  Our server was pretty polite and I appreciated his razzing me for only having water (I had already downed 10 cocktails earlier that day) and was very good with taking our orders and the quirky ways we wanted to change things. Our food came out fast and prompt and everyone seemed very pleased with the change in venue.   Some things that put them above being a typical barbecue chain?  ** At one point someone at the table was telling a story and the pig decided to sit down at the fireplace behind her and imitate her for about 5 minutes before she noticed. It was HILAROUS. You creeped me out at first pig, but I heart you now.  ** Dynamite looking sparklers on free birthday treats??? ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. We were all jealous of that dessert.   What started off as a tragedy was saved by Famous Daves. I was unable to eat my food that night as I wasn't feeling well, but I can tell you that it's pretty good reheated the next day. Yay for the mac and cheese side dish!!

I don't quite understand what this place is trying to be. It's like an odd combination of take out and dine in that ended up just being more than I could take on a rushed evening in between films.  A friend and I arrived with two others on their way and decided to start off with a glass of wine. While we were waiting, we were pestered more times than I felt necessary given it looked like it should be a relaxing experience and it wasn't very crowded. And we weren't just pestered by one person, but by several. I wasn't sure what role any of them played and the whole thing just seemed annoying and disorganized.   When it came time to look at the menu I was disappointed. I was really hoping for more variety. I've been to plenty of Italian places that serve several dishes that do not contain huge chunks of tomatoes, so I know it can be done. Yet, the menu only contained two items I could enjoy, and for what I paid, I expected it to be better.  For what it's worth a quick run in to order coffee to go is usually painless, the coffee's fairly decent and the price is reasonable. I just don't think I'll head over for dinner again any time soon.

I heart the Phoenix improv community. The fact that they can be organized enough to run this festival every year is crazy awesome too!!  I've been at the festival every year since it opened, mostly due to having friends that are performing. And every year, I am crying from laughing so hard and am happy for days to come. That's right people. Need a dose of happiness? Get yourself to some improv.  Some may say that it's not as good as other big festivals and blah blah blah... But if it serves its purpose and makes you laugh while getting a dose of life theater at the same time, how could it be wrong?  Various acts from around the valley (not just Torch Theatre) perform and even some from other cities. This year saw troupes from LA, Chicago, Detroit, and more. There's even a family friendly showcase!!  It's a pretty reasonably priced night of entertainment that everyone should see at least once. And if you're really up for the challenge, I suggest volunteering. I had a blast this year!

I may be the worst customer a moving company can deal with. And they dealt with me so well I can't help but give them five stars.   With all the rave reviews I received from friends and yelp, I couldn't help but choose Camelback to help with my move. I didn't want to have to force my friends to help move my big items. I received a fair quote for moving the large items only. I soon realized though, that it was unrealistic for me to move all the boxes myself. However, I failed to inform them of this.   When the movers arrived, they found lots of fun stuff to move. Did they complain? No. Did they yell at me? No. Did they tell me they needed more people? No. Did they tell me I had to reschedule? No.  Nothing broke or was destroyed or lost, which has happened in nearly every other move I've ever had done.  They came, moved what was there and did one hell of a job. It took longer, and I paid more, but it was very reasonable for the trick move I played on them. They were even fine when it got to be nightfall and my neighbor boys were running into the moving truck.  Well done. Highly recommended.

Where do you even start with Sweet Republic. This was also one of the first places I found upon moving to the valley with the help of a flyer I received at an event.  It is quite a drive for me, but *always* worth it.  First things first. The ice cream and sorbets are insanely delicious. No words anyone writes in one of these reviews could possibly accurately describe the goodness of Sweet Republic. However, I would like to quote one of my friends who had their ice cream for the first time at a recent First Friday. After having a couple bites, they looked at me and said, "Now I know why you drive so far to get this. This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted."  The atmosphere there is so fun and uplifting. They have outdoor and indoor seating, games to play (including connect four) and free wifi. The mint and orange creamsicle decor has such a refreshing and comforting feel.   However, one of my favorite aspects to Sweet Republic is being adventurous. I encourage everyone going to have a try of a few different ones there before deciding on what to get. Also, try something you never thought you would. You'll be pleasantly surprised, because not only will it taste exactly like you imagined, but it will be yummy! The owners put a lot of thought and time into their ice cream and I love tasting the new things they've made and hearing their stories about how sometimes it sounds just as crazy to them and ends up being fantastic.   Sweet Republic is well worth the trip, no matter where you live in the valley. I don't know one person that has gone and been disappointed.

This is definitely a south Scottsdale hidden gem that has turned into one of my favorite places to grab lunch during the work week.  The first time I discovered them was due to the fact that they had breakfast all day. And well, if you know me, you know this usually brings a place up a notch in my book. I love my breakfast. Their heaven sent omelet is spectacular.  Their italian soda comes with cream on the side so you can add as much as you want. Yum!!  Additionally the grilled cheese is to die for. I am *not* a fan of tomatoes at all but for some reason their tomato bisque I actually somewhat enjoy. And it comes with cheddar goldfish. Oh yes. And this isn't a kids meal either.  If you're a Chicago native or Chicago sports fan (which I am not), you will be especially impressed.

One day I wandered into Noble Beast, and discovered an okay selection of items for the mittened kittens, Bic and Sharpie. Not as many items as dog items, and some work definitely still needs to be done in the way of cute cat items, but I did find some pure gems. The first were some pretty healthy treats that they always seem to devour. The second were these lovely felt pieces to be used as toys on tile and hardwood floors. I also think they were laced with catnip. Holy bat shit batman!! Those little toys spun so fast across the house that Bic and Sharpie didn't know what to do. They were going crazy. It is so awesome to see them get so much delight and challenge out of such a simple toy. This is usually one of the first local stores I head to for new kitten gear. After that, I resort to looking online.

F&E rocks! It's right-sized. Once you get a feel for it, you will begin to wonder why other grocery stores are so huge, when you can find 98% of what you need at this cute little market. Their pre-made lunches are typically the main part of my weekday diet, as is their oatmeal and containers of pineapple.   My other favorite things include their flowers, which last so much longer then flowers you pick up at other grocery florists, and the chocolate covered almonds. Do not try them unless you are fully prepared to be addicted.  The staff is super friendly without being completely in your face. I appreciate that they aren't scarce like in big box stores.  Love you F&E. Love you!

I heart the Phoenix Neutrino Project. I think I go so often I should have a lifetime free membership. Seriously. You all thought I was joking, but I wasn't. Someone should work on that.   Think of it this way. It's improv *and* a movie. The crowd gets involved by donating props that have to be woven into the storyline. Three groups each get a prop and go off on their own to film short segments of a story. They are then ran back to the viewing location where they are edited and all merged together.  The cast is always awesome and the crowd has a chance to be actively involved.   It's only $5 and well worth it. You have to go once, and I guarantee you will want to go again and again.

I love Fresh and Easy and I LOVE this store. The selection really isn't that bad for a smaller market. I can get pretty much everything I need unless I'm shopping for a random hard to find item or something that is non food related like a swiffer mop (though the refill pads are there). I love how clean the place is and the packaging and presentation of their items is well done. You can find a lot of items that foodies crave in decent sized portions to either make for yourself or prepackaged items that are also pretty delicious. The prices are decent and the staff is amazingly friendly. I love my weekly trip to Fresh and Easy for some goodies to last me the week. Especially the part where I buy myself a $4 EXQUISITE bouquet of flowers to bring home for my dining room table. Who said a man needs to do that? Though if they wanted to, this is a great place to go!

Passionfruit + coconut + cupcake = decadent mouth party  That is exactly what happened when I tried that delicious treat after my tour of the Mattress Factory one afternoon. The passionfruit frosting was one of the most delicious creations my taste buds have ever witnessed. On top of that it was beautifully presented and the cafe is quaint and lovely.

Sick of the same old thing for breakfast? Then you need to head here. Go now. Do not waste another minute (unless it's evening, then go to bed now so you can get up early tomorrow).   I took a friend that was visiting from out of town here on a whim as it looked cute to her when we drove past (and didn't have a line). I was not disappointed. We were seated right away in a lovely area outside. The style and decor of the restaurant is gorgeous. The women's restroom was stunning. The staff was also accommodating.  I started off with a fabulous mimosa-esqe concoction that completely hit the spot. Our food came out in a flash. In fact, it was before I'd even finished my first mimosa.   I had ordered bananas foster french toast. That sounds good doesn't it? Let me tell you it was simply heavenly. The presentation was exquisite and it wasn't so rich that I couldn't eat it. It was also the perfect breakfast portion (just enough that you can finish it because leftover breakfast doesn't always turn out well). I have never had such an amazing order of french toast in my life. I left still craving more.  This is truly a diamond in the rough breakfast spot.

I've only been to Tuck Shop once, after having dreamed of how amazing it would be and never finding myself in the area, which I think is the only real drawback. It's never in my line of sight, so to speak, and I occasionally only remember it when it's not convenient to go. That is also part of the charm though.  So anyway, there I was making a daring move to go to a place I'd never been for my birthday (daring to my friends anyway), and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. We sat at half of the community table, and even the pickiest of eaters found items they enjoyed on the menu. As for me, my eyes saw nothing but the home-brewed ginger ale (I make my own ginger simple syrup) and the chicken and waffles. The food was so amazing, no one spoke during most of it. And while they didn't have dessert really for the birthday girl, they brought me out a scoop of cookie dough, in a cute glass dish, with a candle on it. It was awesome they cared enough to make the best of the dessert menu they had.  The vibe is very relaxing, even on a Saturday evening. The service was just the right speed and not at all too pushy and no one minded our birthday gifts and small chatter. To this day, friends are asking when we are going to go back. My answer is always, "Maybe my next birthday." This truly may become birthday ritual.

I've passed SideBar on several occasions but entered the establishment with a group of about 10 for the first time last night as the 2nd half of the last part of my birthday festivities. I walked out happy, which means it was a success.   The highlights? Plenty.  I made new friends. And hey, who doesn't like new partners in crime?  The decor was a great compliment to the night of sexy pretentiousness that preceded it. The couches were fairly comfortable. I loved the exposed brick, the low lighting, the fixtures, the movies, and the music. Speaking of music, songs from the Fugees album The Score were on frequently throughout the night making me want to listen to the whole album so badly that when I got back to my car I spent 10 minutes digging through my glove box to find my copy. I'm still listening to it today.  The service was pretty damn skippy from what I saw. I never had to get up to get my own drink thanks to my amazing friends, but I always seemed to get them quickly.   The drinks I had were very well made. On the suggestion of the bartender I tried a White Rabbit and also had a lemon drop shot. I usually am put off by chocolate based drinks as I'm not a huge chocolate fan and they always taste fake, but the White Rabbit delivered. I could drink it in a gallon pitcher. With a big bendy straw. And an umbrella. The lemon drop was the best I've had.   What do I wish was better?  I'd love to see Frambroise *and* Guinness on tap so I could have a red velvet made (my favorite beverage). The up side was I got a can of Guinness and a bottle of Frambroise and was able to make 2 of my own which also meant I could use the proportions i like (30% Frambroise, 70% Guinness).  After my workout earlier in the day the stairs were hell. However, that anger went away quickly.

Top things to know about DD:  ** Beautiful outside seating ** A menu I'd love to eat at for days ** Breakfast til 4. Yes folks.. 4pm.  I ended up at DD on a day when I was going to make my first visit to Orange Table but running out of time we decided to try another option. We literally saw a sign that said sandwiches (it was really the place next door) and just pulled in.  The menu the menu, oh the sweet menu. There are a million amazing items on this menu that I want to try, and no, not just for breakfast, which they serve until 4 by the way. On weekdays. Did I tell you that already? Sorry, I might say it a few more times. I was torn between a few breakfast options and only glanced a bit at lunch, but it looked very tempting also.   We all I know I love me some eggs benedict, and the server insisted they have the best sauce around so I thought I'd give it a try. Probably should've gotten something else. I was not a fan of their benedict sauce at all. However, they do give you several options for the meat portion including salmon, and turkey sausage, which was what I tried, though it looked more like an actual piece of turkey rather than a sausage.  I wished someone had mentioned smoothies to me before I ordered my beverage too as they had a black cherry mint that I would've loved to try. Also on my list to try.. peach creme brulee :)  The service was great, the patio was beautiful, right down to the sexy tabletops and they even have free wifi apparently.  Not only have I found yet another breakfast on a weekday spot which I am going to frequently drag my coworkers to, but this should be a great place to chill if I ever have that awkward amount of time in between appointments and want a spot to get some work done and chill.  I do wish the servers did more to sell and give good recommendations though... they should stop recommending the eggs benedict.

I had been hearing about Gangplank for as long as I can remember. My first encounter was towards the beginning of this year when I swung by for a peak during an event. I absolutely fell in love with the space and the concept. Since then, I have been holding my IxDA Phoenix events there and heading to Gangplank for other meetings and events. They have been so helpful by not only allowing me to hold IxDA Phoenix there, but also asking me if I'd like a permanent spot on their calendar.   It's a perfect spot to foster collaboration, ideas, and discussion. There are white boards, tons of tables and chairs, wifi and so much more. People are always there to bounce ideas off of, and you can't help but be inspired when you sit down and get ready to accomplish a goal.  Most recently I was there for the ReOpen Phoenix event last night. I love music and get a kick out of seeing the results of collaboration of different styles and genres so I thought I would sit in for a bit and have a listen. I ended up staying there until the very end. The music was fantastic, it was great to meet new people, and I ended up being able to get some work done all at the same time. This definitely needs to happen more often.  Truly a great place to spend a few hours at if you need to get something accomplished! Great things happen here!

I'm not a runner. I only run to keep in shape for other sports. Or when someone challenges me to a half marathon. I don't turn down challenges often.   So when I noticed my shoes were not doing the trick, I decided to head into Sole Sports to see what exactly they could do in a way of good, comfortable and cute running shoes.   First thing they made me do was run on a treadmill and video tape it. What did I learn? That I run like a baffoon. That didn't stop Sole Sports from helping me find the perfect pair of baffoon running shoes though, and ones that were still cute at that. I walked out with a great pair of shoes and some other running/work out apparel and feeling great about my sub-par running capabilities.   I've been back several times since for water belts and other items and they've been as stellar as the first time. They even helped me find a non black pair of running capris for the PJ Chang's half and ordered them for me. Purple here I come!!  Whether you hate running or love running, if you do it, you have to go here.

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  Not another beauty and no brains personality. Those completely disgust me! But alas, it's true. So true, I'm not sure anyone can hype this enough for me to try it again.   People said it was fantastic. The menu looked amazing. I had decided it was dessert for lunch day. And I was anticipating the banana bread pudding and doing all I could not to think about it until lunch time arrived.   Let me tell you this place has all the beauty. The decor and feel is sexy and sophisticated. The end.  Upon arriving some of the items we anticipated were not available, including the wine I wanted and the dessert I had chosen as sacrifice for Friday lunch.   To be quite honest, I don't even remember what I had, just that it was a terrible salad that is easy to forget. What I do remember though, is our food taking forever to arrive, dirty silverware, a haphazard server, the wrong dessert being served when we did order some to share, no banana bread pudding and a french onion soup that looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for three days before it was served.   At least there was an entertaining table of hungover college teenie boppers to entertain us. That and most of it was covered with a groupon.

Talk about awesome. I always manage to forget this place is nearby. It took seeing a Jimmy Johns to stop in the plaza and remember it the other day, and a few days later, as a friend and I were both low on groceries, we decided to head over. It's one of her favorite places to go, and as soon as we walked in I could see why.   It's like a sushi dive bar.. the perfect sushi place to have near your house. It's the place you can walk into in your pajamas and not feel out of place. It's the sushi place you can enjoy easily by yourself. There is no bar to sit by, but it doesn't even really seem to bother you while you're there.   The staff remembers you and your name... and your order. And whether it's to dine in or take out, you are served quickly. The menu is simple and makes ordering quick. I decided to go with a Philadelphia and a spicy salmon. I was completely satisfied. It was filling, just the right size, and very well made.   Happy hour has some great sake and half off roll specials that sound like a great after work trip some lazy middle of the week when I feel like going out but without all the dolled up drama. What a win!!

Abridged: Meat. Cheese. Potatoes. In bread. Oh and Banoffee pie.  Unabridged: This is my favorite Pasty location. First off, there is tons of space. Tons. The decor also has a nice relaxing but slightly sophisticated feel. And there aren't a million ASU students prancing about and hardly ever a wait in line when we head there for lunch.   Vegetarian or not, there's always a pasty for everyone. Every time I've gone to either location, I've never gotten the same one twice, and I still have over 3/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones I would love to enjoy. They're big enough that half the time I end up taking half home with me... though that's probably because I after trying the Banoffee Pie, I haven't been able to not order it since. So usually it's take half my pasty home and split Banoffee, which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet.   All the items are made there, and if you sit at the bar/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant. It's kinda fun really. Sometimes I watch a little too closely if I know they're making a favorite, trying to figure out how I can mimic this masterpiece at home. Alas, I've always ended up failing.   One thing to note is that while they make them there, they prep them in advance so you cannot substitute. However, I've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so I can enjoy it a few days later.  So, back to this Banoffee Pie deal... I think I need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review. So, it's a pretty awesome dessert. First, you start with a thick graham cracker crust. I am personally not a huge fan of graham cracker, but this isn't your typical crust like on a pie or a lemon bar. This looks like texas toast. For serious. Then add some homemade caramel, homemade whipped cream and bananas. This only adds up to a win.

Right now I am consuming a combination of raspberry tart, pomegranate, and birthday cake yogurt mixed with coconut, pineapple and walnuts.  Right now I am also in heaven.  I usually get the same thing every time I go, but it's never led me astray and it's really delicious. The flavor of the pomegranate and the texture of the coconut are my overall favorites.  I noticed what seemed to be new flavors today (such as the birthday cake) and some new toppings such as various new fruits and new cereal ones. I think this means that next time I might branch out into birthday cake and cap'n crunch! One thing I'd love to see is marshmallows.  I've never been in there and had slow service. It's help yourself and always seems to go smoothly. The location being hidden on mill kinda sucks as far as driving down there and parking, but that's Mill, can't blame them completely for that. Prices are a little expensive too but you do get what you pay for. Delish!

That's some damn good bruschetta. For those of you that are not a fan of the tomato persuasion, you know how comforting it is lately to see bruschetta that does not contain tomatoes. Not only does Postinos offer great alternatives, they are divine. My favorite by far though, is the one with pistachios, though I devoured them all. Second fave, roasted red bell pepper. Mmmmmm. Okay need to stop thinking about that. Already had breakfast and am craving food again.   Our server was super nice and attentive. I felt like I was at a resort being pampered, not out for a brunch with friends. When my champagne, honey cucumber lemonade concoction erupted like Mt. St. Helens and not even the champagne drink champion could down it in time, he promptly came back with a towel to clean the table up. LOVE!  The country toast was mouth watering. I was a bit surprised to see tomato salad on my plate as I didn't see it listed with the item on the menu, but meh. It can easily be pushed aside. More things should come without tomato as a default garnish though.  I ate every last bit of my food and consumed my entire champagne beverage. Not sure that last part is surprising to anyone at all.  The outdoor patio is beautiful though a really tight fit. We were pretty close to a cactus... almost too close for comfort.  Will I be back? More than likely.

I love Luci!!! For real. Not Lucy, the whiny bitch who doesn't like to make dinner and cries to her husband, but Luci, the amazing joint that makes me an amazing lunch AND breakfast and offers a great atmosphere and friendly staff.  I get my coffee there for the cups alone, which are corrugated and do not need those pathetic cardboard sleeves that always fall off other coffee cups.  The breakfast sammie is so huge, I cannot finish it for breakfast, which is awesome. Lunch is equally as great. I have never been able to try a dessert yet as I always leave full.   You can't go wrong with this cute little market, their cooking classes, the awesome seating and the amazing food.

I once again feel the need to sing my praises for Luci's. And more specifically, the weekday morning crew. At some point I bought myself the best supplies to make myself a morning coffee for the road. And sometime a few days ago, I realized that was a damn waste of money. Because I was only going to end up at Luci's. Luci's is where I can go to get a nice dose of sunshine, both weather wise and people wise. Luci's is where I can go and make up my morning song about hot coffee, and rather than have the staff look at me funny, they freestyle right along with me. Luci's is where the name field on the order sticker doesn't say name, but rather says neighbor. Luci's is where I can get breakfast for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And weekday morning Luci's is nice and calm and quiet, which allows me to start the day at my own pace.

I was hesitant to visit Moira after mixed reviews and a friend that got sick on a recent visit... but I had two hours to kill and a craving for fish and so here I ended up.   I also ended up going back for dinner the very next day.  I liked Moira after I had we had a chance to warm up to each other and get over the awkward first meeting where I expected the door to go the other direction... wayfinding people.. I'm telling you.. even buildings could benefit from great user experience design.  My service both times has been the pace I needed - the first time it was slow so I could just relax, enjoy the atmosphere, and not get to my next meeting too early. The second I had like a half hour and our server was once again on top of the ball and got us out and to the Herberger in just the right amount of time.  The sushi... delicious. I've had a few different rolls and some nigiri as well. The only one I didn't really care for was the yellowtail. My favorite was the ebi nigiri. :) The scallop appetizer was delicious, and Moira gets their spicy rating right. The thai chili on top was just that.   Given the choice, I will probably choose the bar over a table as it seems they just stuff people in the back of the place and move their way forward, and I wasn't really digging that. I loved the bar and talking with the chefs while I was eating. While sitting at the bar the first time, I even got to watch a lemon juggling act while eating my mochi.. which was DELICIOUS btw.   I don't live nearby... yet... but with pretty decent prices, this will be my sushi stop when I hit the craving while downtown.  Bonus was the server gave me mad props on my phone wallpaper which is rambo shooting weapons while on a unicorn. I like his style!

I am not sure how this place has so few ratings that are kinda terrible. I had the best experience here when I was looking for the perfect first bicycle (of my adult life.. huffy's don't count).   After going to a few other shops and feeling like a burden when I explained what I was looking for but I wasn't exactly sure what the best options would be for me, I stumped into Tempe Bicycle as a last resort. What I found was the gorgeous bike I saw online that I had been drooling over, and Debbie, the best sales rep ever.   Every type of bike and their pros and cons were explained to me, without hesitation or impatience and without feeling like I was a burden. Any question I had was answered nicely and with a real explanation rather than trying to blow me off by telling me some made up answer that I wouldn't catch on to.   I was told I could put a down payment on a bike and pay it off in 3 months. Also, if it ended up I didn't want it, I'd get my money back. Really? this is too good to be true, yet I said I'd have to think on it.   I ended up putting a deposit down the next day over the phone with Debbie and she was so nice. She asked me when I would be in to visit my bike again, which I just died over. How cute is that? That's exactly how *I* think!!  On the say I arrived to get my bike I asked a few more questions about the bike such as whether I could put different tires on and some other features of the bike. Debbie then walked me through and helped me get all the accessories I wanted and needed as well as spent the time really explaining the difference between items and why I needed them. On my final checkout I received 10% off of EVERYTHING.   With free classes and amazing service, I truly lucked out finding my dream bike at a dream store. If you want good service and/or an adorable Biria bike like mine, head there and ask for Debbie.

Gallo Blanco doesn't serve a bad breakfast, but I'm not sure I'd rush back. Just not really my style. My rating was a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to 4 because of how awesome the staff was with out table of 20+ on Saturday morning. We were able to get separate checks and no one's orders or bills were screwed up at the end. Everything was also pretty much delivered on time and as wanted.   The mimosa was delightful and the Chilaquiles Verdes was delicious. It had just the right amount of heat and was the perfect amount of food to keep me full for awhile without being full in a sick to my stomach way.  I do wish they'd offer black beans as well as the standard refried. Then I may have not had such a hard time figuring out what I wanted. There was almost nothing left by the time I eliminated refried beans.  On another note, Gallo Blanco also runs the rooftop bar and last night the bartender made a great suggestion on mango vodka, sprite, and simple syrup. It was a total win and one of my new favorite drinks.

If you ask my friends how long it took me to decide on just one breakfast item the day we visited Local Breeze for Smunch, you will understand why I will try this place again. The menu looked fantastic. In the end I had to go with the local breeze omelet, but several items, including the french toast were tempting.  Local Breeze was a gorgeous setting for a spring brunch. I loved the complete relaxation that overcame me as I sat down and the fact that they were well accommodating of our party that kept on growing.  The best part was their bread. I loved their homemade bread and will forever and ever!! If you come only once, please just come and try the bread.  All in all, my meal was good but not outstanding. But the bread will have me coming back to try others.

What is a good reminder that I live in the wild wild west? Where can you see families riding their bikes, friends out for a good walk, athletes training for marathons and me pretending I love marathons?  The lovely bridle path, that's where. And how do you know when you're at the bridal path? When you get to the horseshoe and dirt path. Yep. I'm serious. And, it's in the middle of Phoenix.   I love the bridle path. It's my favorite place to get a good jog in and do a good bit of people watching at the same time. And stay in the city. When I'm not on a hike, this is usually where my run takes me. It is a little bit of the olden days right here in the city. The path is pretty frequented on weekend mornings, especially Saturdays, but it's not too crowded that there won't be room for you. Trust me. You should try it out. You'll get a good workout, some beautiful scenery, and it's a lot better than running on the pavement :)

Warning: Do not attempt to eat this on a day you are watching your diet. However, everyone needs an off day don't they?  I went years before realizing El Coquito was within walking distance of my office. And it didn't take more than a few days before we were dying to try it once we found out.   El Coquito is kinda tucked away in an old plaza off of McDowell on Granite Reef. The inside has a nice homey feel to it. Various tables of different sizes, pictures on the wall, a TV playing some good ol' futbol. We arrived 5 minutes before the website said they open, and we weren't even the first ones there. Fair warning, that you may want to give yourself time as the place is small and appears to fill up fast.  Be assured though, that the service is still top notch. We were greeted promptly and our food came quickly and just as ordered. I ordered the mofongo with pork and an unleaded coquito. And for the half hour I sat and savored that meal, I was completely overcome with bliss. The textures were great, everything was the right consistency and temperature and the flavors were amazing. Be prepared for the high garlic content, especially if you use the extra garlic that comes on the side, which I did. May want to wait while before smooching anyone.   Highly recommended, and a place I know I will be back to on various occasions. For those wanting to go with a group of friends or coworkers, splitting the bill was no issue.

I cannot believe I wasn't the first one to review Loveland. I also cannot believe it took me three weeks to visit this boutique considering it's right next to my homes away from home.   If you've ever been to Altered Ego you should remember the end near Solo had a small amount of clothing and jewelry. I've purchased two things from that rack and gotten a million complements on each. They're so unique and extremely reasonably priced.   Apparently everyone else thought the same thing, and the woman that ran that small line opened a store next to Solo Cafe a few weeks ago. I've been meaning to go in and just now had the chance.   The place is ridiculously incredible. If you love supporting local businesses and you love unique clothing for toddlers and women and great handmade jewelry and accessories, you need to stop in.   My first thought was how great it would be if the store was connected to Solo just like Solo is connected to Altered Ego. Well word on the street is that's happening tomorrow. Yep, there goes my wallet. Can I just rent this area instead of my house? It would be much easier for me. I'm officially hooked on the strip mall at Mill & Baseline forever more.  The atmosphere is exactly what I'd expect of anything next to Solo and Altered Ego, which is nothing short of breathtaking. The wall treatments are exquisite (especially the hot pink wall, which I now have the name of the designer of), the lighting fixtures are romantic and elegant and the whole feel is almost a romantic contemporary in my opinion.   The clothes are still all reasonably priced and very unique and well made. They have dresses, shirts, pants, skirts, jackets, hats, bags, jewelry, and then a whole line of almost the exact items for children. As with any boutique store the sizes vary, sometimes greatly, with different lines of clothing.  As soon as I walked in I felt like I was home. The owner Jinia was there and I was excited to finally meet the person behind the goods I treasured. She took the time to talk to us about the store and her thoughts about opening it and so much more. It was truly a fantastic experience.  I wanted several dresses but then I spotted a gorgeous necklace with three sets of pink beads. Yep. It's mine now.   Their official grand opening is next Saturday and I'm sure it will be a treasure to attend.

I know.. an update with the same rating, but I just cannot get over how amazing of an experience it is every time I walk into this store. I was in there most recently a few days ago, hoping to find a bit of good luck in the clothes department, as I had been wearing cargo pants forever. That in combination with not being able to fit into most of my cargo pants, I was dying for a skirt.  Jinia and I talked for at least an hour as I got to see all the new things going on and catch up. I ended up trying on a few pieces I never thought would work with me, including a skirt made of neckties and a strapless mini dress. The end result? All of them looked fabulous and I walked out with them all. The necktie skirt is my absolutely favorite piece and everyone that's seen it thinks it's a true gem. The necktie line also includes brooches and purses.. definite must sees!   If you haven't been yet, you're truly missing out!

For the past decade, I've wanted a tattoo. The only problem was, everything I thought of, I didn't think I'd want years down the road. I love accessories, but I'm pretty picky about anything permanent. Last year, I finally decided, and had a friend draw up some sketches around my idea. The result was something I couldn't *not* get inked. And when I started asking around, everyone pointed me to Heather at Lady Luck.   Heather has a quaint little shop in Braggs Pie Factory. Heather has a pink glittery art piece of a unicorn. I was in love with it. She was in love with my tattoo. It was a match made in heaven.   I worked with Heather for about 4 months before the big day. I showed her my sketch. We discussed the procedure and prices. I had the sketch stenciled on me in at least two different places so I could try out places before the day came. I called her. I emailed her. I asked her a million paranoid questions. I was sure she'd be annoyed with me by the time the day came.   I went in, and Heather had a TV set up for while I was there and a stand that I could easily set my water and phone on. I brought a few movies of my own and my ipod, but I didn't even use them. We ended up watching one of her movie and laughing and talking about it the whole time. She finished the piece in nearly no time at all, which pretty much takes up the front part of the top of my left arm, but is only in black and white in a little over an hour. And only the bottom of Dot's dress hurt, and even that pain was tolerable. I was surprised. I had completely planned on freaking out and ending up with a toe or something and that's it. Instead, I walked out with the most gorgeous thing I could imagine, an appointment for a tiny touch up a few months later, and great instructions on how to care for it.   And still I called a few more times, unsure if what I was experiencing was normal. And no one yelled at me or became annoyed (at least to my face). And the touchup was free.   Here I am about 8 months later, with a tattoo that to this day, gets way too much attention. But hey, that's part of the reason you get one right? Everyone loves Dot. And I love telling the story of how quick and painless it was and referring everyone that wants a great inking experience to head to Heather.   I'm not sure I could ever pick a better piece than Dot, but if I decide to get a second, this is where I'll head.

I had the most intense and invigorating workout of my entire life here. It only lasted slightly over 7 minutes.   I have only had one day at the gym so far, but was so impressed by what I saw, encountered, and learned that I needed to tell my story.   Saturday I headed there to make use of the personal training that was available to me for the weight loss competition Gangplank is putting on. I have my own gym, and I love going there for the dance classes, but I figured a personal trainer couldn't hurt. I'd had one before at a previous gym and it was great.   I arrived not really knowing what to expect other than I was going to have a person assessment done that would then be used as a periodic benchmark to measure my progress.   Competitive Fitness is a small gym with a big personality. They strive to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle, not to make people lose a million pounds. There are only two types of machines available - the treadmill which is used for warming up and the rowing machines. Most of the exercises done are based on movements the body does naturally.  I was greeted almost immediately upon entering and was brought to a treadmill to warm up while one of the trainers, Sally, went over what I would be doing that day and how the gym works. About halfway into it, I met with Jason, who was going to be going through my assessment with me. I think I gained more knowledge about fitness during this visit than I ever had in my entire life. I also learned I did not know how to use a rowing machine and I am way more coordinated when I'm dancing.   Then it was time to do my assessment. It was so intense that I was a little light headed and needed a million gallons of water when I was done. Later that day I felt it in my legs (and still do today). It was also only 7 minutes. It felt like forever and throughout the entire thing, everyone else in the gym that was working out or hanging around was cheering me on. It was so incredible. I've never felt that level of community and enthusiasm in a gym and it really does help.   Tomorrow I will start my regular training. Each day there is a set routine or list of exercises everyone that stops in performs. A trainer is there to walk through the proper way to do the exercises and to help along the way. They are also timing you. At the end your time is posted on the board. This not only helps track progress but creates that competitive environment that really does help regardless of what people say.   It's a great way to think about training and fitness and I'm looking forward to the next few weeks here. Depending on how this goes, I am looking to switch from my current gym to this one when my membership runs out. If I could pay for two at one time, I might consider doing it sooner.

Hurray for another pizza place I can go to when I actually have a craving (which is rare). And... boo for it taking way too long to try this joint out. Sad face.  The menu is much larger than I expected and has plenty of tomato free items to make me happy. I called in a to go order one day getting a chicken ranch pizza which no tomato and an order of fried zucchini, which, by the way, is an EPIC WIN WIN Win Win win win win win....  I get there and the place is as bright as my personality. I was super in love with how fun it was! Total hippie vibe, laid back.. great place. My food was ready quickly. I was also surprised to hear you can pay with a credit card, which according to previous reviews, was not an option. In case you missed that...  You can now pay with a credit card.  I couldn't help but grab a blood orange slushie on the way out and I think I had it devoured by the time I got home to eat my dinner, which was fabulous.   I'll be back.. and hopefully next time I have enough time to hang out there, eat, and chat with the staff. It look like that would be a blast!!

Ugh. Just when I was getting happy with my little area of Tempe. I have my coffee, my hair salon, my cute boutique shop, my dive bar, my Fresh and Easy, and then they had to add a Wal-Mart. A little part of me died the day I saw the coming soon sign. A little part of me dies every time I see the building and I have to admit I don't cross the intersection of Southern and Rural much anymore.  However, as chance would have it, I was looking for a very specific item this weekend and the only place I knew that carried it (as the model I found first was about to be discontinued) was at Wal-Mart. So, I put on my best pair of loungewear meets dancewear and forced myself in. The store is small (thank God) and is not a large vastly sized super jungle.   I first attempted to search for the item, and had no success. I then headed to customer service to see if they could check and see if another store had the item. I gave them the information that is listed on the company website to use and was given back a blank stare. Apparently the information listed on the website for the online store items cannot be used to look up inventory?????  I am now trying to gain back brain cells.

The 4 stars is in comparison to other Chipotle's I've been to, especially in this area.  I have to admit, when they were building this plaza, my friends and I tried to guess every day what it was going to be. We had it narrowed down to a Chipotle or a sushi joint (both would kill me for sure) and I cannot believe we were actually right.   I am pretty pleased with this place. Both times I've stopped by it's been clean and pretty speedy service. Every time I come in, I am surprised by all the extra room around to the side and out on the patio and it makes me happy.  I'm sure anyone reading this has been to Chipotle, but if not, or if you're feeling like trying something new.. my signature dish for the past few years has been carnitas bowl with black beans, corn, fajita, lettuce and a little bit of the dairy stuff. Wash it down with a Nantucket nectar apple juice and you're golden.

Despite being a chain, one of my favorite wine stores is Wine Styles. I've always loved how they categorize their wines and conduct their tastings.   Rather than categorize by red, white, type of wine, or region, they categorize by the same flavor families such as crisp, mellow, nectar, bold, and I believe a couple others. They are very knowledgeable about their wines and the staff at this location is extremely friendly and helpful. I've been here twice now and would gladly come back.   The first time was almost a year ago and they introduced me to one of my new favorite wines to buy consistently, New Age, as well as that it's better chilled, over ice, with a lime. Yes, sounds odd. But it's been a consistent bottle in my house.  Last night we headed there to celebrate a friend's birthday and they were having a complimentary wine tasting for their anniversary with food also. They had some amazing wines on the list, including New Age, which I am sure I have everyone hooked on now, and most of them didn't even try it on ice. They also had this wine-a-rita mix that was to die for. I had like two glasses and bought the mix. It's very good with fruit forward wines.  Our party was given our own roped off area outside which was nice considering the gorgeous weather and as a bonus we were then able to listen (and sometimes dance) to the Greek music from the restaurant next door. It was a great place to have a great conversation and enjoy some fantastic wines. This tasting was pick your own from a list rather than everyone having every wine in the same order, and I was impressed at how the staff remembered what we all wanted every time and we had a group of about 14 people.  Sometimes I forget about Wine Styles because it's a chain, but I'm always happy when I end up there.

Marilyn is the bomb!! HTC in Tempe was my former go to place and I'm so excited there's now an Uptown location too. I was getting a little tired of my industrial, and when it fell out recently, I used it as a perfect excuse to go in and get something else done. Marilyn helped me decide an anti-tragus would be perfect. And it is. It healed perfectly and I was recently able to go in and size it down a bit, at which point a photo was taken for their gallery.  There's usually only one staff member working at a time here, so there can be a line, but I think it's well worth it. It's clean, the staff is awesome and friendly and it's right by some amazing shops if you want to wander a bit on those crowded days.

Never once have I been disappointed by a show I've seen from Torch Theater. Never.  In fact, those are usually the times I've laughed the hardest in my entire life. I go so often though, that it means I laugh hard. A lot. I wonder if I can get a physical condition from that. Oh well. It'll be worth it.  From tournaments such as Cage Matches and the Phoenix Improv March Madness Playoffs (PIMMP), amazing troupes such as Searching for X, Mail Order Bride, Light Rail Pirates, and Galapagos, and improv classes, you are guaranteed a good time at one of their performances.   Do yourself good and hop over to one of their many shows soon.

Some people may call this place in incomplete.. the hand painted signage on the windows that some use on their cars, the  patio tables for seating inside.. the empty feel it has. I, however, think it was on purpose. Some way, somehow, it causes instant relaxation. The brightly colored walls combined with the patio furniture really did calm me down and allow us to enjoy a two hour conversation without ever being pushed to leave. Hell, we didn't even get our bill until the wonderful Matt C. asked if we could pay. I've been wanting to get to this place for ages, but just never found the right time or occasion. It happened to be perfect earlier this week for dinner with a friend after I was picked up from the airport.   The food description Matt C. described is accurate so I'll elaborate on other points. The menu, which we both took pictures of once we saw Goat Curry listed, is small and interesting. It leaves me wanting to come back, and yes, next time, I will be getting the goat curry. I'm sure you are all lining up to come with for my 2nd visit now.   I had the jerk chicken with rice, plantains, and a side of vegetable (I had two to choose from - steamed eggplant or bok choy). It was very delicious. The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful, and wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken, which had some decent spice to it, actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember.   The plantains, oh the sweet plantains were PHE NOM IN AL!!!!!! Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?  To drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious. And, well, the name itself makes it worthy.  Overall, this place was reasonably priced, and allowed us to enjoy our meal slowly, and talk for hours afterwards. The staff is truly genuine. If you're in the area, I'd definitely stop here.   The food is a 3, but the atmosphere is a 4, and I'm giving A Taste of the Caribbean benefit of the doubt.

Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol Honestly my lunch was just okay Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype  But, I am supposed to be honest.  This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.  The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it.   One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.  The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.  I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily.   I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.  So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops.   What I paid for this was ridiculous. The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous. The food was meh. Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there. It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.  One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.  Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!

Holy hell. How is this Vig so much better than the other one? After visiting for the first time yesterday, I was angry at myself for waiting so long to make it there. Did you think The Vig could get any sexier? Well it can. It's called The Vig Uptown. When it was freezing ass cold outside yesterday and I was in my jacket, hat, scarf and sweater, the "outdoor" area was a dream come true. The fire and a cup of coffee was the perfect ending. As always the staff is great, the food is amazing at a great price and the place always makes me feel swanky as shit. New home away from home.!!

*When* I actually let someone else clean my car in any way, shape, or form, this is the only place I have been able to trust so far.   They have a great list of offerings aside from a basic car wash, such as hand waxing, shampooing, and cleaning the interior plastic and fabric. The prices, in my opinion, for the care your car gets is well worth it.   The car wash itself is automatic but touch free. You can watch the entire thing from inside the lobby. Additionally, when your car is done with the wash and is getting any additional services, you are able to watch as well from the big patio that is outside the front of the building. Call me over-protective, but if I'm gonna take my car to get waxed and detailed, my pride and joy lil 3, you bet I'm gonna make sure every detail is done correctly. It's also nice to enjoy a little sun while you're at it too.  A bonus is being able to have chips in your windshield replaced using your insurance policy right there on the spot.   Another bonus? Their air fresheners for the most part don't smell like ass.  Sometimes it has taken longer than I've been told, even when it's dead, but they have been very apologetic and it's been worth it for my car.

This place is like donut crack.  Buying donuts for 8 coworkers = a million donuts??  Only at Bosa!  They have so many donuts...so many that it's impossible to choose only a few for your small group of coworkers. So many that we eat until we hit a breakfast sugar coma that can only be topped by Thanksgiving and still have some to give away to coworkers to bring home to their families.   The staff is so super nice and help guide your overwhelming mind in as little time as possible to speed up aforementioned coma.   For serious. You can't go wrong here people. Donut crack.

I have a backlog of 20 something reviews, but I had to write this review immediately. Why? Because I wasn't allowed to have lunch unless I was eating for four.   You're probably asking yourself if I'm serious or if there was something special going on. I assure you I am completely serious and I didn't see anything special.  Everytime I go to my Krav Maga classes or Swadee, I stare at iKitchen and wonder what it is. One time I had an in depth conversation with a friend over what the name implies. Is it serve yourself? Did they just think if they stick an i on it, people will come? Do they sell self-serving stoves and kitchen appliances?  Today it was enough to make me wander in. I saw some pretty good yelp reviews and my curiosity couldn't stand it any longer. The menu looked pretty delicious. After looking over the various noodle, rice and ramen dishes along with the incredibly tempting flavors of smoothies (cookies and cream, green tea... mango mmm), I decided to try a bowl, which serves one and comes with rice and a salad and an appetizer just to have an assortment.  As soon as I said orange chicken bowl, I was shot down. Apparently bowls (which are the items that serve one person) are only served during lunch hours on weekdays. Dishes are served all the time and serve 4 people. I told her I wasn't hungry for a dish and didn't have 3 other people. I would've paid a slightly higher price for a bowl, but instead they let me walk out hungry. The smoothie was still tempting, but I was not about to give them my service. I'll hit up my local fro-yo place instead... and order Chinese take-out elsewhere.  Unless it's that time of the month for you ladies, you haven't eaten in four days, or you have a large party of people that like the same thing... or it's a weekday lunch, I'd head elsewhere.

Where else do you find yourself saying "Have I choked you yet?"  Can't think of very many, which is just one reason why this place is awsometastical.   I went to a trial Krav Maga class here this weekend and ended up getting a membership I was so impressed. It's not just self defense, but fitness, martial arts, boxing, and street fighting all rolled into one. There's even some tactical weapons and fighting classes for the extra crazies.  They have several different classes, all pretty much super ultra intense. Don't go if you aren't really wanting a work out, because you won't get any sympathy here. My intro class was an hour of nonstop activity in a very militant like setting... swearing... getting in your face... the adrenaline rush that I enjoy.   The staff and other participants in the class were very encouraging with my lack of technique. I've done just about every type of fitness possible but martial arts.   I encourage everyone to try this place out...even the women folk. To entice you... I give you the fact that law enforcement train here as well as attractive men... and you get to practice kicking bad men in the groin... but that's not why I go :)

The ever changing menu at Conflict Kitchen is one the reason I wish I was closer to PGH.. or at least visited more often. The concept absolutely fascinates me. A pop up that has a revolving menu, but always from a country we are in conflict with.  I was in the area last fall while Kubideh Kitchen (Iranian cuisine) was going strong, and well, this was on my list of must visit places. While I was partially concerned that I had built it up too much in my head that it wouldn't be as good as I had hoped, these fears quickly disappeared.   It's not fast food, but I appreciate that. My friends and I all ordered our sandwiches and beverages. My beverage was a ginger beer that heeded a spicy hot warning. It hailed from Jamaica (not quite Iran).  That food was good. Let me tell you. We sat there beside it, unable to wait until we drove elsewhere to eat. I loved the research they did into the authenticity and the prices were very reasonable. The wrappers for the sandwiches have facts about the country as well as their relationship with the United States. They are so well designed I took a spare and still have it as a keepsake.  Bonus was that you could technically order vegetarian, though you won't get the full experience. Someone ordered a sandwich with no meat shortly after us, which meant bread and mint pretty much. They looked like they still enjoyed it.

Crazy. Awesome. Good. I cannot believe it took me this long to try some Short Leash Dogs!!  The truck is adorable and the service is top notch. I don't have to repeat things 50 times and the service is much quicker than I expected.  I ordered the Lady dog which has onions, fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese sauce. I got it on an all beef dog. I added mushrooms to it for something extra.  When I got it, it was piping hot in bread that I think is naan, and if not, is something pretty damn close. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. I didn't want to admit that I had an empty dish in front of me. I wanted to get in line and buy another. But it was enough for a complete meal and I knew I had no one to roll me into my house even if I managed to make it to my car.  It was piping hot, which was good but that combined with the bread made it a little hard to hold. I'm not complaining though. Next time I'll just have to knife and fork it, which is completely fine by me.   Additionally they have pepsi in a bottle, which is hard core. I'm a fan!

I had what I can only describe as a mouthgasm my last visit to Lee's so I decided it was about time to give this place some props. Picture going to a birthday party and mashing together your carrot cake and your ice cream. Then having someone pour Jameson on it. It was one of the most epic displays of ice cream I've ever seen. And I've seen my share of ice cream.  The employee that night was awesome and very personable. He patiently allowed our indecision and laughed with us nearly the entire night. He didn't get annoyed (or didn't show it) when we were clearly the loudest two people in all of Old Town that night.  The only reason this place misses a star is because it's not in CenPho and I feel a lot of the flavors aren't things that interest me. I usually only find one or two I'm interested in. Makes it easier, but not as fun.

That's a Wrap turns me into a vegetarian nearly every time I go. And I get hit on by hipster waitresses. I also can't believe I've never reviewed this place until now.  What do I love about That's a Wrap? Everything. The people are awesome. The space is extremely laid back and inviting. They have jameson and ginger ale on their limited cocktail menu. They have homemade lemonade. They pretty much have homemade everything. And I hardly ever get the same thing every time I go.   That's a Wrap knows exactly what to do to please me.  The Tarragon and the Veggie Jackson are probably tied for my favorites. I've always wanted to try the carrot cake, but I'm deathly afraid I'll love it too much.  When I was in a few weeks ago, it took abou 20 minutes for my to go order, and to make it up to me, my next one was on the house. Because this place is awesome.

Oh. Mygod. Ohmygod.   I thought the first time I came here and only enjoyed coffee that it was spectacular. Then I came back for the crepes. Consider my mind blown.  Not only does the outside have major curb appeal (LOVE the use of color), but you can sit at a coffee bar or outside... or in this whole other room. Come on. With that many seating options, there's something for everyone.  One night I was there, a movie was playing outside. This is the kind of place people can come back to. And the kind of place that Phoenix desperately needs downtown.  The stars reached their highest notch though when I went against my gut instinct and ordered the peanut butter cup crepe. See, I'm a huge fan of the Reese's cup. However, I feel it is nearly impossible to imitate. No one gets that flavor combination right and I end up being sadly disappointed.  If this is your fear too... order the peanut butter cup crepe from Jobot. It was like taking a bunch of Reese's and melting them in a crepe. I will still full from dinner, but I'll be damned if I didn't eat that entire thing.  The staff was super friendly, having conversations with a friend and I as we sat at the counter and indulged our sweet tooth ( is sweet teeth a word). I'll be back.. as often as I can manage :)

It just seems to be that I need to have a flu. As my luck would have it, my doctor only had the pediatric one available and suggested I try to find a clinic that would have it. I checked various drug stores and pharmacies only to find that they only gave them out on certain days. Even then, I found one that was offering it that same day but by appointment. I call to ask for an appointment and was told I have to also have a prescription from my doctor. For a flu shot? What? Okay crazy. Buh-bye!  One of my coworkers found this Minute Clinic so I thought I'd give it a shot. HAHAHAHAHAHHA  Yeah, okay that was bad.  Anyway.  I get there and find a computer-based sign in procedure that was very easy to follow and simple to complete. Way to go for a good user interface! i was then 7th in line. The sign in area clearly told me what I would have to do and that the wait could be as long as 15 minutes per person because they also take sick patients and not just those needing immunizations.  Everyone that was ln line seemed to have left so I was in within 10 minutes. I gave my insurance information to her and had my shot and was out in 5 minutes because everything was so easily completed in my sign-in procedure beforehand. All my questions were answered beforehand and the woman administering the immunization was very nice and helpful.  Later that evening I noticed I hadn't received anything with proof that I got the immunization on that date; just the I Got My Flu Shot Today sticker. I called the 800 number for the Minute Clinic (you cannot call a store directly) and asked them. They were super kind and immediately faxed me the paperwork I needed.  Great service from the time I first approached the Minute Clinic area to the phone call with them the next day. I highly suggest it!

99% Adorable 1% Creepy for the crazy mannequin that's usually dressed up outside by the road  And I never fail to walk out with something 98% of the time I'm there. I've bought everything from amazing glass pie plates to a vegetable steamer to little utensils. It's unbelievable how many different items they have, vintage and brand new. Last time I was there one of the employees told me they get a lot of items given to people as housewarming and wedding presents, and rather than returning or exchanging them, they end up selling them there. I've purchased several brand new small kitchen appliances there. Never mind the fact that I'm always drooling over the vintage cookbooks. Like I need more of those.   Before you spend a bundle on something you're not sure how much use you'll get out of, head here.

Abridged:  Just go. Every bad review you've read has been wrong.  Unabridged: I was worried. Afraid. Scared of heading to Big Earl's after the reviews I read that it just wasn't up to par. I'm so glad didn't listen and went anyway.  I guess I'm glad I walked in the side entrance because I didn't see the big display of tshirts Martin mentioned in his New Times review. Or they just aren't as out there. Or I was just really craving food. Either way, now that I'm thinking of Martin, I wonder if he knows he's on a big framed banned poster hanging up at Big Earl's.  The place could benefit from some decor change, but I honestly think it's still that way for the mere fact that it's in old town. I bet those business buildings have HOAs. Tuscan/crap/southwestern style or die....  But. I digress...  Usually when I see lunch menu options at a BBQ place I tend to want to skip them b/c I think they're going to be ruined 'by the bun" and just a small icky amount of what I want to enjoy. Looking at the prices and sizes of the lunch and dinner menu though, I could tell Big Earl's was some serious shit. Serious. It was hard to make a choice. They have desserts with chocolate whip people... chocolate whip. I almost avoided real lunch food altogether. They have a leg of beast feast... folks.. if you got this for carry out, I'm not sure how it would fit in your car. But I can guarantee you'd eat it all.   So what did I get?  The Kentucky Mule is bourbon and ginger beer. And it was perfect.   I was the only one in my group to ever have fried pickles before, and I was curious as to if they were as bad as mentioned before, so I ordered them. They were PERFECT. I have yet to see fried pickles done as well in this area as they are at Earl's. I have turned several people into fried pickle enthusiasts!!  Then I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese. And I was full. This was the largest lunch I've ever seen. The bun at first looks like a cheap attempt at a bun, but it compliments the pork perfectly. Their sweet & spicy sauce is my favorite and the mac & cheese was to die for.  As we finished, Tony, who cooks and created the sauces, came over to our table to give us a chance to let him know what he can fix. One of my table guests sarcastically complained about the mac & cheese he devoured. The result? We were brought out another side of deep fried mac & cheese. HOLY HELL!!   This place is amazing. The food is stellar. Drinks are great. Prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality and I would come back again in a heartbeat. Have I convinced a gaggle of you to come with for the leg of beast feast??? I don't want to eat it myself, but I have to admit, I'm hella curious.

How have I never reviewed FilmBar? This is exactly the kind of place Phoenix had needed for ages and the type of theater I craved. See, I don't really like big box anything (stores, restaurants, etc). And this even includes theaters. I also don't really care for most major motion pictures either. About 1 every year interests me enough to pay a bajillion dollars and sit with 10 million other people.  See. I don't just like FilmBar for the beverages. That's only a bonus. I love it for the small awesome non chain theater it is. And for the great movies it offers. And for the fact that you don't have to go in to enjoy a movie. You could go in just for the bar.  The staff is super friendly. Gift certificates are available. I believe you get a free movie on your birthday. It's pretty super rad!!  I see so much potential: screening major sporting events and other events, more quirky documentaries, rock band karaoke using the giant screen. Let's do some of these. Then I'll only love you even more than I already do.

Don't worry Windsor, we'll get to you. First though, I need to talk about your assets. The brown tartan patio chairs. They're perfect. Brown's not used enough in decoration and I think it's usually way better than black any day.  Now. Let me just say you are a fantastic host. The fact that the rectangular bar and the patio are the two main focal points really makes my day. Too many establishments focus on the indoors. The decor is exquisite, and nearly as good as what I'd do :)  I insisted on being seated on the patio and do not regret this decision for one minute. I hadn't quite decided what I was going to eat as a main course or drink that evening... but I knew I was devouring the shit out of that cheddar fondue. And I was right. There was a lot though, and I'm glad I had a friend to help devour it. I think we both agreed it was the best pretzel bread we've had. The pork and the sausage were great additions and I'm a sucker for apples and cheese. Another point for you sir.  The server kindly agreed to allow the flavor of the ginger in the no. 89 to rise above the pear and I appreciate him for that. It came out in a cute glass and lasted me through my courses. Not too strong, not too weak.   I was saving room for Churn (how can you not), so I settled on the Waldorf chicken salad for dinner. However, the layout of your menu confused me. In the same space below it, it listed different additions such as salmon, shrimp and chicken so I thought I needed to clarify I wanted chicken. Then I confused the server. Apparently, those options are for the other salad items. But the layout of the menu layout implies the opposite. You may want to reconsider the organization of the salad section. One of the best Waldorf salad's I've had though. Great presentation. My date for the evening had the Windsor burger with mac & cheese, of which I sampled the mac & cheese and one of the wine smothered onions. That will be my next attempt.   Everything's pretty reasonably priced and there's a great selection of beer and wine available as well as well thought out cocktails.  I had a few different people at the table that night, refilling waters, taking plates.. and it took a little while to get a bill. I wasn't sure if I could ask anyone.. did I need to wait for my server who became a little more scarce? I don't know.   Overall though... amazing. You are very rapidily climbing the charts.

Hi Windsor. Wink. I think I'd like to keep you. This place gets even more wonderful every single time. I've ventured into nearly all of the menu by now, and all of the items I want to try. When there's a lot of different things on the menu that interest my tummy, that's a good thing. Don't lose that part of you.  What's my favorite so far? Probably the fondue for an appetizer and the windsor burger (no tomato) and church potatoes for dinner. That seems to be the popular choice I make 80% of the time.  So.  What about the other 20%? BRUNCH BITCHES. Yes. There's brunch now as if this place couldn't get any better. Lovely, delicious, amazing brunch. Brunch with $5 pitchers of drinks. Brunches with some of the best biscuits I've ever had with my biscuits and gravy. Brunches that left the large group of people I came with amazed and full.   The service is usually right on point. The food is always incredible. The decor I cannot seem to get enough of, and even though I am not a fan of having to valet, you make it complimentary. And the valet people are pretty cool. Is it sad that I'm nearly on a first name basis with them as well?  I beg you to stay, Windsor. And challenge you to deliver brunch to my house.

Hi, my name is Tonia and I fully endorse a good artisan ice cream place in uptown so I don't have to force myself to trek to North Scottsdale.  Not being able to wait any longer, I decided to venture over on the 2nd night. It was better than I expected, though I'm not quite sure why I would've expected less.   The decor is EFFING ADORABLE. Period. Exposed brick, a white clean look and argyle? Yes please. In fact, I want that argyle wall in my house. I demand it be done.  Everyone was super helpful when I paced and wandered.. wondering just what to get for my first experience. I decided to try two flavors, banana and butter pecan, thinking one would clearly top the other. The result? Both win. So. I got them both. That and a red velvet cookie. I mean, come on, who can resist that?  The ice cream is just what this area has been missing all along. I was secretly hoping for an endless bowl the entire time, though my stomach was clearly telling me I needed to stop indulging. It had the right amount of sweet and salty combined and was just pure heaven. Especially when eaten on the gorgeous patio they share with Windsor.   Why the 4 stars then? The cookie. Oh that cookie needs some work. The entire outer edge was hard and nearly stale. I think it was due to sitting out all day, but that still should've been remedied. My grandma can send me cookies from 4 states away that still manage to get there soft as they were out of the oven. Maybe that's why I demand more out of my cookies. Don't worry though, I'll be back... but you will need to try harder to woo me next time.  P.S. I saw what appeared from context to be the owners/managers of the establishment roaming about the entire hour or so I was there. I really had wished they would've started conversations with the few patrons that were there...

Abridged:  Coworking (drop in + packages), event venue, meeting space, awesome.  Unabridged: Really? No one's reviewed Co+Hoots yet?   Co+Hoots is a great space in an old building on 7th Street near Roosevelt. It's a place for small businesses, the self-employed and anyone else interested to have a space to work that's not their house. It allows for brainstorming, socializing and bouncing ideas off others. There are both rates for drop in one time visits and for packages for full-time inhabitants.   The work environment is an open collaborative space with meeting rooms to use when needed.  I've been there several times for both professional organization meetings and social events and every time I find it hard to leave. There's such a welcoming vibe and the creativity that abounds in that place is astounding.   If you need a place to work for a day to get out of your element, a place to call home for your business of 1, a spot to hold a meeting or a swanky sexy space to hold an after hours gallery or social event, this is your place.  Still not convinced? Swing by and check it out. I'm sure they won't mind!!

I ended up scavenging for lunch a little later than usual today, and wanted something light, and that's when I saw the new yogurt place on Mill Ave offered smoothies. While the outside still looks temporary, I assure you the inside is filled with happiness and kindness. And yumminess.  It didn't take long before an employee asked me if I had been there before, and explained to me how it works. The easy part most people get is that it works like most other fro-yo places in the area where you make your own concoction and pay by the weight. However, there's lots of organic yummy stuff too. Their smoothies use yogurt instead of milk from what I was told (which sounded heavenly).   It looked like there were a ton of toppings to choose from and about 7 or so different flavors of fro-yo. Since I was on a smoothie mission though, I didn't take a great while to look at those in detail. I did notice on top of the toppings bar though, a sign that said they always have bananas and will slice one up for you upon request. BONUS!! BANANA BONUS!!  I loved the smoothie options available, as they weren't all filled with strawberries and other things I am not a fan of. Why people want seeds all up in their smoothie is something I don't yet understand. So I ordered a pineapple banana smoothie (my two most favoritest fruits) with some protein and energy boost.   While I waited I noticed that there were lots of great signs along their walls informing patrons of what separates them from other fro-yo places as well as lovely little sign on how to make your own fro-yo sundae if you are late to the game :). I also noticed they have a club card that is free where you accumulate points per purchase. One downfall is that there isn't much seating - probably about 10 or so high bar type chairs along the back wall, but I've never seen too many people ever sit and eat in one of these joints, so it may not be a complete deal breaker.  It's a small but very cute and super friendly place and I really enjoyed the smoothie. I usually end up making my own because it's more convenient and I can get exactly what I want. But now I know, if push comes to shove, I can get exactly what I want here too.

I'm not afraid to admit it, I found out about Laura through a mutual follow on instagram. That's right. And well, I had been looking for a new brow person since the one recommended near my house is clearly a dud.   I'm not a girlie girl either, so I get my brows waxed like um a few times a year. Thankfully I don't really have bushman eyebrows to begin with. However, I've been having them waxed for over a decade so I know a good waxer when I come across one. And Laura is good.  Her station is immaculate and calming and she is super fun to talk to. Waxes are very reasonably priced and painless. They even come with a tint, which I had never had before, and is like magic people. Like magic.  Bonus is that she's ready at the actual time of your appointment. And I was able to schedule via text. WIN!! Everyplace should allow me to text or some other call-free way of appointment booking.  Laura, I'm sorry I haven't been there in like six months, but I'm due soon. And you'll be the one I text :)

If Crescent Ballroom isn't cool enough to make you want to stop by this place, their restaurant, Cocina 10 should be. I will now find any excuse I can to head here just so I can eat. Not even joking. The most frequent reason is trivia on Sunday nights, which is pretty epic.  Most of the food is Mexican faire, and the guacamole is not to be messed with. That shit is serious. Additional bonus points for non-tomato based salsa. Way to branch out and avoid the common! While I've had many items here, including a hamburger to die for, I usually end up loving the al pastor burrito the best, though it's so giant I can rarely finish it.  The drink menu is also great, with a selection of wines, beer and amazing cocktails, such as the Honey Badger. I would input some don't give a shit joke here, but that's old.  The only downfall is that service can be pretty slow. It always takes me a while to flag down someone for a refill, check, etc... but the food comes out pretty fast. The food is so good though that even slow service can't keep me away. I'm a fan.

I can't even begin to say how needed the Crescent Ballroom was in Phoenix. It's about time we had a nice, amazing small music venue where I can see all my favorite bands and not break the bank. I can even try out bands I haven't heard before. All in an intimate setting where I can be so close to Ra Ra Riot that my photos make me look as if I was part of the press.  I find myself going to so many more shows than I did before, and I get to have a burrito while I'm there too. Who doesn't want a burrito while they're at a show? NO ONE. And you can order it without leaving the concert space, because there's a bar in the back.  Most of the space is standing room, but there are bleachers in the back too and some small tables also. The sound is amazing and I've never once been to a show I didn't like.   I'm in love.

I've had my eye on this place ever since I saw the sign put up ages ago. I've been hunting, searching.... trying to find any piece of information I could. And then about a month ago an opening date was given. It was also then I discovered that it was being opened by the owners of Not Too Shabby on Cave Creek Rd.   I was a bit worried at first that it was going to be a beautiful store, but nothing that fit my mid-century modern feel. That still didn't keep me from being breathtaken today when I swung in to see if I could find a lil something for myself.. and walked out with a few items.  The vibe is like a yard sale and really makes you feel at home. The employees have some pretty swanky aprons I want to steal for my kitchen and are super helpful. Even when you don't think to open a book to check for the price. And even when they said they'd been eyeing one of the items you purchased, wanting to get it in a week or so.  There are tons of items from the 30s-60s mainly, from farmer to modern. There's some new items too, with that old feel, such as jewelry. But mainly, this is stuff I've had a hard time finding on 7th Ave, and at a better price.   You can tell a lot of attention was made to purchases and decor and that everyone there cares.  I didn't expect to purchase Mr. Boston's De Luxe Official Bartender's Guide.. or the steel mik crate and bottles... but I'm sure I'll find a place for them. They are lovely.

Considering I've been there the last three Saturdays in a row, I guess I can pretty much call myself a fan.  Talk about a great space to have a farmer's market, as well as a great list of vendors. This past week, I bought my pumpkins there and drooled at the homemade scarves and hair clips that were available also. I've eyed the food trucks over and over with burgers, mexican food, dogs and icy treats.  One weekend, friends and I swung by to browse and ended up buying a whole meal from the market. We purchased basil and ginger. Zucchini, eggplant, squash, carrots and onion. The veggies as well as grass fed ground beef were grilled and local hummus and dips were around while we waited.   There are a few places that take credit cards but most take cash.  What? Cash only you say? No. Don't worry. If you don't have cash you can go to a lovely "ATM" booth where they will swipe your card for a credit card payment and give you $10 tokens to use at the booths. It's brilliant.  Everyone is so helpful and friendly without being overbearing and the grass makes it a great place to grab breakfast or lunch while you're there and sit on the lawn and enjoy the day. There's shaded table seating as well if you prefer.  I highly suggest you swing by. You will love it. Just make sure I get what I need first :)

Central Farmer's Market has become my main source of groceries and supplies for nearly the past year, and I can't give this place enough stars. I am so in love with the experience and the quality of items that I get sad weekends I have to miss it and go to a typical store. It really bums me out to not chat with all the booths, enjoy my Shine latte or arnold palmer (I'm the one that walked around with that pink one like all summer), try out some stuffs and find locally sourced foods to cook meals with the entire week.  Around the holidays, the craft booths get taken to the next level as well. Last year, I was able to buy 90% of my Christmas gifts at Central Farmer's Market.   In the summer, when it's hot and no one wants to be outside, they fix it by having a mainly all indoors market and even keep the music around. Can you think of a better spot than a place you can shop for great local foods, listen to some local bands and enjoy some breakfast or lunch from the awesome food trucks that stop by? You can even get gift shopping in at the time time too. As soon as they start selling dish soap, toilet paper and other general house supplies, I may not need to go anywhere else.  What are my favorite things to buy you ask? I can't even name just one or two. I love Hayden Flour Mills polenta. I love Gina's  Homemade Pepperoni Pizza. I always have Squarz Pies in my freezer for when I don't feel like cooking. Pinnacle Farm is a great source of produce and I even get various meats there, including some of the best buffalo I've ever had. I also head to Superstition Farm's truck or booth for the hugs :)  I love you Central Farmer's Market. And I enjoy being your duchess :)

Copper Star has always been a place that feels like home to me, and the owners have spared no expense at making their next venture,  Circle H Barbecue, feel the same way. I also can't thank them enough for seeing the potential in the old Taco Cabana (and for keeping their bathroom signs - it's a riot!!).  The place has such a nice vibe to it, and the attention to detail can really be seen in the well designed menu, the space and the staff. The tables are all branded with the circle h logo, which is actually a brand once used on a family farm. Pictures of the family hang on the walls to admire as you wander about the space and there is a lot of room to socialize and enjoy some great barbecue.  I've been waiting ages for this place to open, and upon hearing of their first official day of their soft opening (grand opening coming in a month or so), I was able to convince a few friends to swing in to grab some dinner. While everything on the menu wasn't there, most of it was. Well, aside from the Dr. Pepper cake which I am now dying to try. The menu consists of appetizers, some common, some uncommon, like the grilled cheese sandwich trio I think will be a frequent meal and the gringo nachos. Salads are available as well as sandwiches, platters and huge combo meals that will probably cover a family for a decent price.   I had the brisket sandwich, and the others in my party had the Memphis Flyer (pulled pork + slaw). The food came quickly in a basket with the typical red and white checkered paper. Mine came with the sauce on the side, which is homemade. While the brisket needed no sauce, it was too good to resist and I loaded it on. The bun never got too soggy and hard to manage and the barbecue was amazing. It was enough for a meal too without feeling too full.   They are still in the process of opening, and as such all the decorations aren't yet up and the bar is not available quite yet, but this should not keep you from trying it out soon. The patio is gorgeous, the people are great, and it's another great reuse of space by a great local business owner.  Bonus is that it's right off the light rail so you have no excuse to not head there. They will also eventually serve breakfast, which, well, we all know I'm a fan of.

Can I just say that this is one of my favorite community places? Because it is. The staff is so knowledgable and extremely helpful; they want nothing more than to see your garden/farm thrive and for you to have fun doing it. My first experience there, I ended up taking two classes and learned more than I ever thought I'd be able to retain about gardening as I am hardly the green thumb. So there I was, frantically writing it down and hoping I remembered. And a few weeks later, I started to plant various things I'd like to grow in different pots and scattered them about my yard, trying to see what grew where. I had insanely tall zucchini sprouts after only a few days!!! And yes, I know most of you think that's nothing, because it. grows. ANYWHERE. But not for me. I don't keep plants alive. And these lived. And I liked it so much I went back to get advice on how to build a raised garden bed. And I'm now starting to install it. They even offered to test my soil for me. Like I said. Best. Place. Ever. Go. Your garden will love it.

Yay!  I love this place!!  The decor is not only stylish and unique, but pretty much useful. I love the ammo bins on wheels to sent condiments and napkins to the other members of your party. The rest of the interior design is great also. However, I do wonder if women had any input as the chairs have no backs and there are no purse hooks. Which means, my purse goes on the floor or the table. Either one is not appropriate.   However, the food was amazing. And I'm German. I started off with the basics. A pretzel and cheese. Beer brat.  WITH ROOTBEER ONIONS. And beer. And strudel. And I didn't get hungry again until the next morning (and that was lunch).   I really appreciated that the food was served on metal trays. It gave a little bit of extra flair. And I give extra points for the way management handled the patrons beside us that started off with a compliment and quickly turned to complaints.  The service was a little slow for being lunch on a weekday, and there were no purse hooks. So I'll be back, but will probably only bring my wallet in. Like a guy.

I started off with every intention of a good review about this place, because the food was amazing and because I love to give props to local joints popping up in Sky Harbor.   I had the carnitas burrito minus the pico de gallo (ew tomatoes) and it was phenomenal. The perfect size. The perfect combination and proportion of ingredients. Carnitas that made me want to marry it.   There was a long wait for tables so I ordered my food to go. I put my name in as well but had already eaten because I was starving. I sat at a table ready to crank out some work while waiting for a flight.   Getting into a table with a carry on and a laptop bag is nearly impossible. I don't know why restaurants in airports continue to do this. This is a new restaurant. I really wish they had gotten it right.  When my server arrived, I notified him that I had ordered no more than 20 minutes ago, but that tables weren't available at the time, and that since I was already finished, I'd just like a glass of water.   After 5 minutes he came back with my water and informed me in a very condescending manner that when the wait for tables filled up again, he would have to ask me to leave, because even though I ate while tables were not available,  I was not considered a paying customer.    This is where the stars dropped to three. Why 2 then?  If he was serious, that's bullshit. If he was saying it to clear the table, it's still bullshit. And that's exactly what I did. As soon as I got to a stopping point I got up and left. No one said see you again soon. No one said have a good flight. In fact, I heard him laugh as I walked away.   I'm sorry, but in an airport, you need to be sensitive to why someone is sitting in your restaurant. Sometimes it's because it's the only decent choice. Sometimes it's because they arrived batshit early scared to miss their flight. And sometimes, it's because their flight is delayed a few hours and they don't want to sit on a crappy airport chair. Or there isn't even one of those available.  Most of those scenarios are not good. You have a captive audience. People aren't driving from downtown Phoenix to Sky Harbor to eat at the airport Blanco and go home immediately after. And if I am starving and I order take out because a table is not available but still want to sit, don't be an ass.  I love your food, but the service is enough that I'll go elsewhere next time. It may even drive me to a chain restaurant down the hall.

So now that we have the light rail, decent restaurants in our airport and a train in the sky, it's like Phoenix is a real city. I can't begin to describe how much easier travel is with the Sky Train. I've never waited more than 5 minutes for a train and if I get there early enough I can even pre-check my bags. The issue is, I'm never there early enough, even if I'm there 90 minutes before as it states. The station is clean, the walkways are awesome and it drops you off right near all the concourses at terminal 4. I never thought the shuttle was much of a pain, but man, this is so much more efficient. It's about time I actually look forward to heading to the airport.

Okay. So let's get real here for a minute folks. All of you that call yourselves my friends that never told me this was behind Lucky Strike are dead to me. DEAD TO ME. I had to discover this due to a friend hosting karaoke there one night.  This place makes me feel sexy just walking in. Even if I was wearing sweatpants and a hoodie. Sexy! The seating is comfortable, the dance floor is large and in charge and there's a stage if you feel the need to be the center of attention, which I sometimes do. I'm a performer, what can I say.  I haven't eaten here but the drink menu is solid. Give me some whiskey and ginger concoctions and I'm game.   A game room is nearby so everyone in your group can be happy and have a good time. The skew-ball is off the hook.  With plenty of options and being connected to Lucky Strike, this place is a winner. Parking is validated and the light rail is nearby, so you have no more damn excuses.
