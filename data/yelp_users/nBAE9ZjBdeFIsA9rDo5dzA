Whatever happened to customer service?! Hello Hi How are you doing? Allegedly Liz is unsure of those simple greetings. It took about 15 minutes to have our order even taken when it was empty to begin with. We ordered wings fries and side salads. Which by the way is DELISH and I could honestly take shots of wing sauce and ranch for funzies. I order the same thing every time! however when my order came no fries were delivered I told the person that brought it we ordered fries so she went and approached Liz -- right away Liz came over and told us we didn't order fries I said yes we did but don't worry about it and she walked away. I was telling my friend we did order fries and from across the room Liz yelled you did not order fries. I quickly ate a chicken wing so I didn't tell her how I really felt. To say the least who screams across the restaurant?! I know what I ordered! RUDE and never again will I be back to that location. Liz take some customer service courses you might get a few more 20%tips. PS because I don't want to focus on Liz I do want to mention that Ashley that brought us our bill was extremely friendly and wish I had gotten her from the jump. Another amazing food place.. bad customer service!

I have been here a handful of times because the wings and ranch are delish! I have tried a few other things on the menu but nothing compares to my favorite cheat meal from zipps of wings,fries and a side salad with ranch!   However after my last visit I will not be going back! The service was horrible-- from the moment we got there our waitress was very rude and we could all tell very unhappy we were a party of 8. I am not sure what happened to customer service but she had none! It took forever to get even a glass of water! She didn't smile once it was weird and awkward. She may have been having a bad day but thats none of my business. Her service was awful!   I should have learned the last few times things had happened like my brother leaving his wallet there calling them asking them to hold it and when he got there it was no where to be found or the time we went for my aunts birthday and they forgot to inform us or show on the bill that gratuity was included and allowed us to tip 20% more on a 500$ bill. At the end of the day Zipps and shady. To be honest this place deserves no stars.

I have been looking for something to challenge myself in the fitness department--not only because I have been at a plateau with my weight loss for awhile but also because running on the treadmill and doing the same weight lifting has become BORING! So after hearing great things about Pro Edge Boxing I finally gave it a shot and tried their newest class called "Blackout Boxing"!   My fears of intimidation and feeling like I would be the only female there were put to ease the moment I walked in!  After the first class I new this was exactly what I had been looking for. It was a challenge, a great workout and super fun! After only 2 classes I finally saw the scale move and realized this is exactly what I needed.  The atmosphere is great, everyone is super friendly and most importantly I am looking forward to working out again! I absolutely LOVE this place!   P.S. Blackout Boxing is a MUST!!!! Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30 pm.

Right now their services are 30% off so I decided to give it a try! Ends up I will be coming back! It is very clean and brand new! The gel colors available are endless so many I stopped looking:) They also have the perfect match for a pedi with regular nail polish next to the gel color which I loved! Overall the customer service was legit and I plan to be a repeat customer!
