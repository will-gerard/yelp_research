Staff is rude. Dollar pool tables don't work so you have to get the hourly tables. Then the staff tries to over charge you. Go some place else.

My kitty had a lump and was limping.  I brought him in and was taken care of. I was impressed with the care the doctor and staff took with my kitty . Thank you.

Just had the most amazing facial with Nicole. My skin feels and looks amazing. She started with a very detailed consultation and made recommendations on what would be the best products for my sensitive and oily skin. She was really great at making sure I was comfortable while she did my extractions. I'm really stoked about the product line she used. My skin is just glowing. Thanks Nicole!!!!!

The food is amazing. Staff is super friendly. Place is clean and really nice. Had the Greek sampler and a side of lamb. It was yummy.

I'm here right now eating the most amazing food. I feel like I'm in another place. I'm in love and will be back soon.

Really terrible service. 2 servers 4 patrons and I still had to get up to get my check. The rice is hard and the fish is so so. If you want revolving sushi go to teharu..
