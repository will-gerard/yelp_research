Stephanie is the best thing to happen to this branch and any bank. She's helped me get all my financial things in order. She is knowledgeable. Even if she doesn't know the answer, she will do her research to assist me.   I have never had a bank experience like this before. Chase has seriously won me over. I'm usually not a fan of "big banks" but Stephanie has made the transition smooth as butter.  Great job, Chase!

This location is inside the Sears Auto Center which is located across from the Superstition Springs Mall.  I really like this location. They were super friendly, I was in and out with a car quite quickly and I did not have to pay a ridiculous deposit. She upgraded me for free since there were no compact cars and we inspected the car together. The only downside was the car's exterior was extremely dirty which she apologized for,  Quick Tip: Check your credit card company to see if they offer car rental insurance. I declined insurance since Discover and Citi Card both offer insurance for free!

What an amazing spot! They've got a huge beer selection with some on draft and most in bottles. Where else can you get live music with cheap beer? It is an old converted house and is hard to find. Supposedly they do that on purpose because they don't want to be flooded with people. That really makes no sense since it isn't on a busy street. However, this is probably one of the better spots I've been to in the Phoenix Metro Area.

We've all been there.  You've been drinking a little too much and the bar closes. You get hungry (I call them the drunchies) and you are willing to eat almost anything. You just want something really good. We made the mistake of coming to JoBot Coffee for Crepes.  We ordered the #1 (Braized Beef, Mozzarella, Swiss, Caramelized Onions, Bell Pepper, Peppercini) the #2 (Chorizo, Fried Egg, Mozzarella, Spinach, Salsa) and the B. (BANANA + NUTELLA + WHIP). The crepe wasn't hot even though it was made "fresh", everything tasted bland and it was not satisfying. Decor was great, service was great and the fact they are open 24 hours on the weekend is a huge plus! However, I'd try something better for your drunchies. For some reason, all of our stomachs hurt that day right after as well. That could just be a coincidence, I suppose.

We ordered three rolls. There as the rainbow roll, surf and turf roll and lobster roll. All three were so delicious. It's rare to find beef in a roll so I knew I had to order it. Surprisingly it was really tender and scrumptious. The bill came out to about $30 without tip thanks to the all day 30% off sushi happy hour. Now only if I can find a good Mexican spot!
