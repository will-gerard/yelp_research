I'm not sure if I came here on a bad night but the food was so bad! I ordered the two taco combination plate. The tacos were "ground beef" which I didn't mind until it looked like the nasty consistency of baby food mixed with whatever Jack in the box puts in the tacos. My husband ordered a bean chimichanga and the beans were so bland and the tortilla was soggy and not crispy at all. The rice was super bland and had no flavor. The salsa was weird. It had a strange smokiness to it which I wasn't expecting. Even the chips was bland! I'm not sure what the heck was going on tonight as my husband and I chose this restaurant to try based on Yelp reviews and pictures posted. The food was so bad that I can't even go back and give it another chance.

They have a wide variety of donuts to choose from. I always end up ordering 3 for myself. Great to go to if you're in a hurry in the morning and don't have time to make yourself breakfast.

Overcrowded with hipsters, but the coffee is great! My personal fave drink to order is the black and white.

This place isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I've never had a problem ordering from here. It's not the best pizza hence why I don't give it a 5 star rating but it's better than order Dominos and Papa Johns. It gets the job done when I'm craving pizza but don't want to go to a sit down restaurant. We usually order pepperoni pizza and the buffalo wings and pick it up.

Tried out this restaurant for the first time today for brunch. It's in the Sheraton in downtown Phoenix. Our waitress was extremely nice. Brunch menu had quite a variety to choose from. Prices were a little expensive. You can order cereal for $8.00 a bowl. I can buy 2 Wheaties boxes for that price. Anyway I had the the freshly squeezed orange juice and the Sonoran Scramble. The Sonoran scramble had Schreiners chorizo so I couldn't turn it down. It came with a huge tortilla. You definitely get your monies worth here. If you're in downtown Phoenix and looking for a place for breakfast/brunch that isn't so crowded, I would go here.

RIETTE AND HER TEAM ARE AMAZING!!   We had our wedding at Bentley Projects. It's a warehouse turned into an Art Showroom. When we first visited the venue, Riette showed us all the rooms and what each room would be like which room is for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. Once we booked, Riette was great at communication and would ask us if there was anything should could help us with. Most of the weddings at Bentley are held during the evening so I asked if we could see what it would look like, and she let us.   The day before my wedding and day of, she made sure everything ran smoothly and that all vendors stayed on top of everything. I highly recommend using Riette and her team if you plan to use any of the Downtown Phoenix Venues that they have to offer!

Love coming here Mondays for their happy hour. They have a great selection of beer of draft. Food wise is alright. I usually order the green chili stew and the Sheridan sandwich. I wish they would add more non sandwich good to their menu or at least do food specials to change up the menu. I tend to get bored ordering the same items week after week.

I love how I can always get in at this place. My nails were looking really bad.  I got a pedicure and acrylic gel manicure. They usually do my pedicure first to get that out of the way. Ken himself worked on my acrylic gel manicure. He's super nice and quite funny to talk to! He made my nails look amazing for my bachelorette party! Prices here are absolutely affordable to. Mind you, the more you add the more they will charge. but I was able to get a pedi and acrylic gel manicure for a great price!

This place was absolutely amazing. I had my bachelorette party here and they made sure they took care of my group. We did make a reservation ahead of time in order to make sure we got a table (the restaurant was super busy when we came). We ordered the cheese board and calamari to start with for appetizers. Super delish! and they also give you bread and butter to snack on. My meal of choice was a the veal chop and it was cooked perfectly! I shared the smashed potato side with my friend and the artichokes that came with is was amazing. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a classy dinner.

I love coming here for brunch. The patio is dog friendly so we like to bring our dogs on the weekends. Service is great here and the wait staff are extremely nice and will always make sure your coffee cup is filled.   Favorite dishes to get here during brunch: Windsor Eggs Benedict with crab cakes and spinach, the Matador (MY PERSONAL FAVORITE), Homemade Donut Holes, and the Golden Flapjacks.

Came in here with super long acrylics that I wanted to become short right away. Tracy was super awesome at getting them to the length I wanted. Usually I get scared when someone cuts my nails, but she made sure to be super careful. They have a great selection of gel colors. I usually get gel manicures with how much I use my nails for. Tracy shaped them to how I wanted as well and made sure the color I chose was what I really wanted.   FYI: Sundays are their super busy days. I highly recommend going some other day if you're in a rush or doing a walk-in. Also, you'll want to tip them in cash.

This restaurant is super cute inside. You have to order first up front before you sit. They have a good selection of breakfast items. I always order the Wilcox Avenue. I get it with over medium eggs, their spuds (which are super delicious!), the biscuit, and bacon.

Even though they have moved to a bigger building... Like literally down the street, the wait is still long. Hence why I give them 4 stars.   When it comes to ordering food though, I go for the special when they do their scramble. It's my fav! It'll usually be some kind of meat and cheese scramble that comes with your choice of potato (hash brown or home fries) and a tortilla. Their strawberry honey lemonade is delicious as well!!!

You know that feeling when you go to a restaurant and you don't want to give it a bad review? Well, today is one of those days. The food was sub par. We had ordered the guacamole which was pretty good. My fianc√© ordered the carne asada tacos which were better than the al pastor tacos I ordered. Mine were bland and dry.   Our waitress however was on another planet. She was one of those waitresses who tried to impress you by taking your order but not writing it down. I have to admit, I do get impressed when waitresses do that, but I'm not impressed when they swing by 15 minutes after taking our order to make sure she remembered it correctly (this was done throughout the night). I also got annoyed how they would offer to bring chips but never did and we also waited forever for our food that should have only taken 10 to 15 minutes to make. FYI: the restaurant wasn't even busy, 8 people were there max on a Monday night at 7:15pm.   Being a foodie, I really dislike writing bad reviews but if I hadn't had such crappy service, or didn't have to wait forever for food that I had ordered, I think I would have had a better experience.

Their happy hour lasts til 7:00pm. Such a good deal! They have delicious rolls on the happy hour menu and all of the starters are included in the HH menu as well. I love just ordering everything and sharing with my friends. My favorite rolls to order here are the Flying Phoenix, Tsunami, and Dirty Rockstar. The Flying Phoenix is the only one on Happy Hour. They have other sushi rolls on happy hour too.

I've been and go to the Vig Fillmore on different occasions.   This restaurant was great at hosting our wedding rehearsal dinner. They sat our family and friends outside on the patio. Food was served buffet style and we were able to pick out 5 different menu items for our guests to enjoy. When it came to alcohol/beer, the servers were on top of making sure we got drinks. All in all, they made sure we were being taken care of on one of our biggest days.   They also have a great brunch menu. Bottomless mimosas are $15.00! You can't go wrong with that.   Dinner menu is great. I feel like every time I come here I have to try every dish. The Hot Vings are my favorite. I like to get half traditional and half thai sweet chili. Another appetizer I do enjoy are the cheesy tator tots. They are basically these huge tator tots stuff with cheesy goodness.   My other favorite dinner dishes are: Big bowl of Posole, the Prime Vig Dip, Fillmore Burger, and the Pad Thai.

Everytime I eat here, usually once a week or every other week, I am never disappointed. The crew here are super nice. The food is absolutely delicious! I usually go for the breakfast sandwich and switch back and forth from the croissant to biscuit. I am obsessed with their oatmeal cream pie. The prices for all the food is very reasonable too. Also, if you don't have time to wait for food, you can order ahead online. This place is just great! Support this business! You can't go wrong!

I tried out this place for lunch since it's near my job. It's super cute on the outside and in. During lunch, you order at the counter. The staff at the counter were nice. I had ordered myself the caprese salad and ice tea. They have 3 different kind of teas to try out. I went for the peach tea. My caprese salad was alright. I kinda wish it wasn't the balsamic glaze was drizzled on just the food and not over the plate. That's why I won't give 5 stars to this place. Every time I placed my fork down on my plate, it would get covered in balsamic drizzle. If I were to order this dish again, I would omit the prosciutto as well because it tasted a little funny. I'm not saying it was a bad dish, the tomatoes and basil were fresh and the mozzarella was delicious. I just would have liked a cleaner plate.

My Review is really 3.5 stars.   This restaurant is basically sushi served on a conveyor belt. Great concept. They charge by color of the plate. I've been here twice so far. It's best to go on weekends like around 6-7pm because they belt is packed with fresh sushi. Sometimes, some of the sushi can look a little scary on the conveyor belt because it has been circling around for a while. You can definitely tell which plates have been on for a while and which plates are fresh.   I highly recommend you don't go to this restaurant on the weekend around 8ish. That's when they start slowing their service and don't place that many fresh plates out. Then you're eating sushi that has been on the belt for over 15 minutes, and it tastes pretty gross.
