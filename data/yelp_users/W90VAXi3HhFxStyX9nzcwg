Oh my goodness this place is wonderful!  Walked in, took a look at the fantastic space filled with great inventory and was almost immediately assisted by an employee who asked what I was looking for. He directed me to my precious X-Men books and I found two incredible ones for such amazing prices. On top of that I used the Yelp deal and saved an additional $5!   Seriously I cannot recommend this place enough. Professional, clean, well stocked and great prices!

I miss this place so bad. First off, the calzone's are amazing, the outer crust is crunchy but not burned and the interior is filled with warm fillings of your choice ( I like spinich and pepperoni) and really good tomato sauce. The pizza, fries and wings are all very good and the fried zucchini is fantastic. The waitstaff have always been good to me and the prices are pretty decent. A sidenote, try the ranch dressing... really fresh and not too thick or heavy. Delicious.

Beautiful new theater with a great staff. Sound and picture quality are great and if I lived in the area (I was on vacation) I'd certainly come back.

It's been six years since my last visit to Phoenix and since I was last here. Not much has changed in the store and that's not a bad thing.   I'm an X-Men nerd, and I found a copy of Uncanny 130 (Introduction of Dazzler) for $10! To the non-nerd set that doesn't mean much. But for me to find a $30 book got $10 is an awesome thing.  To make things even better this store gives an extra 20% off of all purchases, and it's not one of those "we'll give you 20% off of the 20% mark-up we do to give you the illusion of a deal" type places.   Sure the place could be cleaner, and sure it could use an update, but it's a comic shop.   Go there, look around and have a good time.

Came here tonight for mine and my wife's anniversary and it could not have been any better.  Brandon our waiter was amazing. Professional, courteous and so friendly.   The petite filet was so tender and flavorful and cooked perfect medium rare too. The NY strip special had three BBQ shrimp as well. Mojito and sangria for drinks, and then cremé brûlée for dessert.   It was a perfect evening.

This location sure hasn't changed very much since I moved way six years ago. that is not a good thing by the way.   It's crowded, cramped and often disorganized in many areas, and the class of people you get at this store....it's certainly a Walmart. Normally I try really hard to be objective and give the benefit of the doubt for places that have low star ratings. This place however has earned it.

The food was fine, but when I got my drink in the drive through the lid was not on securely and immediately spilled all over my pants. I asked for napkins and explained why. The woman didn't even apologize.

This place looks nice and is in a good location, but my goodness the rent must be insanely high.   The reason I say this is that the most inconsequential back-issues are so overpriced it's actually funny. There are comics in there priced at $9 that are $2 maybe $3 anywhere else!  I'm not exactly sure who is expected to buy a back issue here?   Positives: the guy working there seemed really friendly. Nice looking store

This is one of those places that just gets it right. It's a simple recipe for success too. Make great burgers and have a great location. I can only image how much money they must make as the place is always packed.   Parking is crazy pretty much all the time, seating is tight too. But when you are in Tempe and want a really good charbroiled burger then this is your spot to go.

It's been six long years since I last had a Chicken Poblano. That is far too long to wait, I know, but I moved to Florida. Today I am whole again!  Our visit was good. Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing, but it was just darned good.   I came in with my wife and my grandparents and Macayo's was the place both my wife and I NEEDED to go to.  Our server was on top of our requests, the food was just as I remembered it and boy did it hit the spot.   I've loved Macayo's for years, and I will continue to as long as they are this good. Now I just need to go and buy about 10 cans of the enchilada sauce to send home.

This place is very different from most stores out there. Books, DVDs, video games, books, comics, toys etc. they have everything!   Buy sell and trade your stuff for other stuff. What a great store and an Arizona institution. The staff are great, the prices are decent and the store is just as great last week as the last time I was there six years ago.

Charming place with fresh and really well prepared food.   I had the bacon pancakes and they were easily the best pancakes I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Fluffy, flavorful and the whisky maple syrup was unbelievably good.   Service was amazing. So friendly and so efficient too. The decor was relaxed but classy and charming. I absolutely loved this place.

It's not in the best area of town, but still this is easily the worst Walgreen's I've ever been in. The floor itself was clean and all, but my advice is not to use the restroom at all. First off you need an employee to push in the code to let you in, and then when you get inside.....on my lord! The smell is an atrocity! The cleanliness is non existent and I was ill five minutes after leaving. My mom used the ladies room as well and said the exact same thing too.

Came here for the first time me with my mom who recommended this place highly. I left a believer myself.  First impression was at how great the decor was. Modern, chic and really very clean and well maintained. Sat down and looked over the menu and saw multiple things on both the brunch and regular menu that I'd totally want to try as well.   Ordered the berry turkey sandwich and I was bowled over by how delicious and well balanced it was. The sweetness mixed with the red onion and cheese was just so delicious. The fries they offer are $2 extra but they were worth it. Thick, well seasoned and fluffy, in a word heaven.   We shared the Caipirinha cocktail and oh my goodness, it was fantastic. Citrusy, sweet and such a great price for Sunday bunch as a carafe was only $6!   This place was a total win. If I lived in Phoenix I'd come back often.

The night I came through the drive-thru they were slammed, both inside and out. An employee came out with their mobile order system at 8:00 pm (I remembered them usually coming out during the day) the staff are always so amazing and the food....oh my god the food. I have literally dreamt of this place back in Florida where I now live. Fresh, hot, flavorful and just how I remember it tasting. They say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This place is certainly "ain't" broke.

I'm just as surprised to write this as you likely are to read this but the pizza the other night was actually surprisingly good. Not just good for a Peter Piper Pizza too.   I've had worse pizza at places that are known for pizza. Way to go!   As for the rest of the place it seems pretty clean and new. The games worked and I enjoyed myself there with our friend's kids.

First off let me say that this is a nice space. Coming in its clean and open, bright too.   I wasn't greeted when I came in, which I'm not such a fan of. Just a quick hello is all I ask.   I walked around looking at various things looking for the back issues and for the life of me I thought I'd found the first comic shop with no comic books.   It turns out they are under the front window (awful placement with the Arizona sun) and I looked to see just an anemic selection back issue selection. I'm certain that many people have much larger personal collections than what is here.   So I go to the front desk to see if I'm missing the old X-Men books that I don't see any of (thats uncommon considering their popularity and long history) but there were no wall books or special comics save a couple in a display case.  What I found surprising is the lack of emphasis on comic books. Now, I am sure they aren't huge money makers, and I completely understand that you have to offer additional products to stay profitable and all, but it almost feels cheap to put COMICS on the storefront and have very few comics outside of new stuff. This is more of a retail toy and game focus than anything.   I was directed to Bookman's next door which I did, but that's a different review.

Absolutely incredible store that is legitimately different than other comic shops I've ever seen.   No thumbing through row after row of comics overstuffed in boxes or tables. Instead the comics are on floor to ceiling moving panels making every one easily visible and the prices are clearly marked along with descriptions for key issues too.  I e-mailed the store regarding their stock as the location is further than I'd typically want to drive. I was overjoyed to get back a friendly response and a friendly handshake and greeting when I came by.  Great selection, great customer service and a great store. I'd happily come here again if I lived here.

Really good Greek food that I really enjoyed. The falafel was well seasoned and so tasty. Fresh vegetables, pita and these amazing Greek fries with feta cheese and Greek dressing that I really dug.   The staff were so friendly and the place is really clean.

Walked in and a group of guys were playing table games of some sort. I was greeted and allowed to browse, but no one said anything to me even though I made it pretty apparent that I had questions.   The comic selection is pretty light honestly. Stock is not very extensive and the table units that held the comics seemed unstable to me.  I walked up to the clerk and asked about any additional stock they may have had and was told they had only what was out. I walked out in under five minutes.  I feel that this place could benefit from being a bit more helpful to clients who come in to browse. It felt like they were just more focused on gaming and having a good time talking to one another.

This place is still new so they have a lot to do to grow into the space but they have a lot of room to grow into.   Pros: this place is huge! Tons of space to grow. Lots of tables for gaming if you are so inclined. Looks clean enough too.   Cons: this place has very little personality at this point. Prices are on the higher side, but not exceptionally bad. They certainly aren't affordable though.   It's a big empty vacant space with little comic related merchandise to look at aside for the new comics on the one wall and back issues in a tiny nook on the other side. For gaming this place seemed to be pretty well stocked though  I ended up purchasing a low grade copy of Uncanny X-Men 101. The asking price was insanely high for what it was, but I talked them down to a much more acceptable price that I was happy with. I worked with Ivan and he was both friendly and professional.   This place needs time to fill out and expand to reach its fullest potential.
