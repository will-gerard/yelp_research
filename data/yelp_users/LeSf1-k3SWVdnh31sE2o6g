I'm in love with this place. I work across the street and eat here every day for lunch. Their veggie sandwich, bagels and greek salad are all delicious.   The owners are there every day, which says a lot to me. Plus, they're super friendly.

I love Taco Bell and am known for it (sadly).   After recently becoming a Pescetarian, I have been able to keep my obsession going because they replace meat with beans in everything I want!  After going a whole 2 months with eating no meat (which I'm very proud of), taking a bite and realizing I had eaten some made me sick to my stomach.   This upset me very much! Be a little more careful next time? Thanks.

My family celebrated my brother's 21st birthday here. Seriously, the best time EVER! The staff was friendly, the entertainers were funny, and the vibe was awesome. We can't wait to go again!

I absolutely love this sub shop. The staff is incredibly friendly and greets me by my name (when I order online), which makes it feel so inviting. The subs are NO WHERE near Subway's! I go every week and never get sick of it.

The food is to die for and the staff is awesome. I just bought a house closer to this location, so I'm sure I'll be here even more than I already am. I will ALWAYS be a Mellow fan. Also, their happy hour and reverse happy hour don't help the addiction...

Today my co-worker and I shared what we had to eat from here, then realized we felt the same about the food AND the cashier. No smile, no "welcome" or "what can I get you?", nothing. She just waits there until you start speaking and continues to have no personality. At least fake it, geez.  The only reason I will keep going is I'm in love with their Veggie Pita and Greek salad. Food wise, yum!

I ordered the Flagstaff Spinach Salad along with a side of fries today for lunch take-out.  Their sides are NOT sides, they're huge! Which isn't bad. Plus they were delicious.  AS for the salad.... On their website it states:  "The Flagstaff Spinach Salad We start with fresh spinach, add lots of sauteed portobello mushrooms, red onions, roasted red peppers, diced tomatoes and mix with a tasty potion of lemon and avocado. It's all topped with a little Gorgonzola cheese. Backpack and tent sold separately."  I got no mushrooms and very little onions and peppers. Mushrooms are my favorite too! I do have to say that the lemon and avocado dressing was amazing...  I probably won't go back though, due to the fact that a salad is the easiest thing to make and they still couldn't get it down.

Every time I order from here I forget that it's not that great. I just hate Panda Express so I resort to this place. It's kind of gross inside and the staff is boring. The menu is very plain. I got tofu... it was soggy, of course. I have to dump soy sauce on the fried rice to get any flavor out of it. The food is severely lacking flavor and their pricing is a little ridiculous. Oh, and they don't have enough details on the menu and given that the cashiers don't speak much English, it's near impossible to know exactly what you're ordering.  I'd skip this joint.

Last night my boyfriend and my roommate went with me to this location. My dad used to own a Japanese restaurant, so I know what's good and what needs improvement. Well, there's a few things wrong with this place.  The staff looked as though they were pissed off. No "hello" or "welcome" and no smiles from any of the girls working there. The cashier didn't say a word until we started to order.  Being that it was my roommates first time there, she didn't understand that you got to choose your own meat for whatever dish you'd like. What she said to the cashier was "I'd like the teriyaki" the cashier asked "what kind" three times until she finally told her she's supposed to choose her meat. What kind of idiot doesn't say that in the first place? Not to mention her being extremely unfriendly about it.  With my father owning a Japanese restaurant, I know exactly what teriyaki sauce is supposed to taste like. All three of us ordered some and it was completely flavorless! We had to pour soy sauce all over it to taste anything and even then it didn't help. I also had a side of plum sauce that helped a little bit, but why put plum sauce on the side when there's no sauce to begin with?  The spring rolls are too small, they taste decent, but nothing special.   The price was $25 for flavorless food and bad attitudes? I'd rather go to Panda Express and spend the same about for some flavor and happy workers, even if the food is worse for me.  Anyways, the first time going there was quite enjoyable compared to this last time, but I will NOT be going back.

Some people are just really picky/snobby because none of what the people below me said were true for me. Kelli really is a sweetheart and very good at what she does. I am awkward when it comes to taking pictures, but she helped make the experience more comfortable. Kelli speaks up if something needs to be fixed i.e. clothes, hair, facial expression, etc.- which is VERY important to get the best results possible. I will recommend her to anyone and everyone. My fianc√© and I love our engagement pictures!
