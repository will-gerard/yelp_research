I went to Karim's before a recent D-Backs game for a bite to eat. I was not impressed with my meal. I can't speak of the cobbler though.  I order the burger and fries plate. The burger was dry and didn't have a great taste. The burger meat was obviously frozen. I received a only a handful of fries and my soda was mostly ice. After a few sips, my soda was gone. The meal plates are 4.50-7. A decent price and cheaper than inside the ballpark, but not worth the price you pay. I think next time I'd rather pay a bit more inside to get food that tastes a bit better.  When I was ordering my meal, a guy came up to get a refill, no charge. My friend went to get a refill since his drink was mostly ice, no charge. I went to get my refill and was charged $.50! Come on, be consistent!  The dining area is very small and can only accommodate a handful of customers at one time.  Maybe I'll just skip the food and go to the cobbler next time.

My wife and i went to Coup De Tartes for our second anniversary and we weren't disappointed.  We were seated outside and created a nice atmosphere with the lights and the fountain, perfect for our evening. I would probably only want to sit outside unless it was super hot.  The service was very good. Our server was very attentive.  As for the food, it was very excellent! My steak was really good. My plate also had mashed potatoes and spinach.  I just wish I had more when I was done, but was quite full after the meal and some bread beforehand.  MY wife had the house special of the evening-halibut and said it was one best good fish she's had.  We ended the evening with dessert. I was only going to have a bite or two, but after my first bite of the berry tart, I changed my mind and ended up eating more, much to the chagrin of my wife.  The only downside is parking. There is only a selected amount of spots.  Make sure to make reservations and bring your own wine/beer.

This review is strictly for the desserts.  I've eaten a cookie from LGO before and was excellent. Who knew apple oatmeal would taste so good! Being my first time at the actual location, I was able to see the various selections of cakes, cookies and cupcakes. I had a tough time choosing what to get.  After much thought, I ended up with the old timer cupcake. This is a hostess cupcake on steroids.and talker. The cupcake was excellent. My recommendation is to get milk with the purchase and not wait until a few bites in like I did because of how rick the chocolate is.    Looking forward to trying out other items next time I'm there!

I've always have gone to LGO after Postino and to get a dessert. I finally can now say I've had food that wasn't sweet.  The commuter sandwich was great. The muffin is awesome and the meet, egg and avocado really makes this a great sandwich for breakfast or brunch.  The one down side is the parking and trying to secure a table because of the popularity and good food being served here!

My wife and her friends have raved about Postino and I finally had my chance to take in Postino a few days ago.   The bruschetta is excellent. I had a hard time determining which was my favorite, but the white bean and tomato barely edged out the salami/pesto and mozzarella and tomato and basil. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the 8-10 choices on the menu.  I was very impressed with the food. I ordered the Nine Iron Panini and really enjoyed my meal. The panini was cooked perfectly. The chicken, bacon, mozzarella and dijonnaise went very well together.   Often at trendier places, I'm not full after my meal. Postino filled me up though.  The service was very good. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and provided the check in a timely manner.  I can see why this place is popular. Very good food, nice atmosphere and a place to enjoy some wine with friends in a casual setting.  . The only downside is the limited parking and valet parking.

Of all the Dairy Queens I've been to in my life in CA, TX and now AZ, this is the nicest and cleanest location I've been to. I guess that's what happens in Awhatukee.  The staff is fast when you order inside and also when you order through the drive thru.  I could eat Chicken Finger Baskets and Blizzards all the time! I'm happy to live so close to this location and enjoy all the wonderful treats this place has to offer.

I'm a BIG fan of Los Taquitos! I've been searching for a nice hole in the wall taqueria since I moved from California in 2009. .   The tacos are superb. You can mix and match meats-carne, pollo, pork etc.  I could have probably eaten about 10 tacos.  On my taco combo place (3 tacos, rice and beans) i chose 2 carne and one marinated pork. Both flavors were excellent. I think I may have preferred the pork slightly over the carne. Both meats had a little bit of a bite, which is nice.  I really liked the taste and texture of the rice. The beans were good, not my favorite refried beans I've had.   Coke products are served out  of the fountain. There is also bottled Coke and Orange Crush (personal favorites) among some other sodas..  The menu is pretty diverse and has all the standard fare-tacos, burritos, tamales, tortas, enchiladas etc.  Overall a great meal at a very reasonable price per dish.  Can't wait to head back and try other items!

Just moving into the neighborhood , Niros caught my eye and I had to stop by this establishment and see how the food was. I tried the gyro plate and enjoyed my meal. I've had bigger gyros, but this gyro tasted great and will be going back for more.  You receive a good amount of fries with your gyro plate. The fries are pretty good too!  Besides gyros, there are several other sandwich options to choose from, philly's italian beef, hot dogs to name a few..  The inside decor isn't much, but I'll take good food at a place rather than nice decor/surroundings and bad food.  Want a good gyro, stop by Niros!  Looking forward to going back and trying other menu items.

My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item.   The salesman was nice and didn't provide too much pressure.   There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc.  My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available.   Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldn't be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy! Now I have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs.

I'm at this Target what seems to be at a minimum of once a week. The staff is nice and lines are generally not too long!  The store has always been clean and items have not been out of stock.  I feel the layout of the store could be done slightly better than the current arrangement.  A very minor issue.  This Target has a small food section. All the items I've purchased in the freezer/refrigerated or pantry items have always been fresh.  The worst part of going to this Target is making a left onto 48th street during certain hours of the day. With the traffic on 48th/Ray and the shopping center across the street, turning can be a challenge.

I'm glad I finally had the chance to finally eat at Ruffino. Upon entering the doors, the ambiance and decor was nice. We (wife and I) were promptly greeted and escorted to our table.  The place was packed. There was also live music playing, which was nice to hear.  One thing I really liked was the salad being created and tossed to your liking at your table.   I really enjoyed the mozzarella that was on the caprese salad.  The chicken parm and pasta I ordered was excellent. I really enjoyed the sauce. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and felt satisfied after.  My wife ordered the rigatoni and also enjoyed the food. I though the meal was a bit dry. A bit more sauce would have been better.   One thing I really noticed was the service. The waiter was great and there was also staff filling your water on a routine basis. The manager also personally came by at the end of the meal to check how things went. A nice touch.  The noise level was a bit high, but there was a large party a short distance from us, which probably contributed to the higher decibel level.  The one downside is the limited parking spots. That's a good thing that the restaurant is busy, but bad if you have trouble finding a spot.   My wife and I will definitely be back on a date night in the future.

My wife and I have been looking for a rocker/glider/recliner to place in our nursery. We've looked at a few places and came across Rocker World.  The salesperson was great. He gave us all the information we needed and didn't hover over over us. We tried several chairs and was there to answer any questions.  The quality is better than you will get at Babies R Us and other furniture places and you can customize your chair as needed.  After about an hour, we made our choice and we are happy we did.  A cool feature is there is a pillow and baby doll for moms and dads to use and get a feel for how the chair will be with the baby. A nice touch.  The rocker/recliner will be ready in about 3-4 weeks and they are willing to let us use a loaner if needed.  Why did we think of going anywhere else?

I went to Jason's on Saturday night for the first time. I ended up with a side salad and a baked potato. I didn't think you could have a baked potato that big! The potato was huge and could have been a meal by itself.   Large selection of items to choose from. I wish there was a few more vegtables at the salad bar and had more crouton options.   I will have to head back to try the sandwiches.

The family and I went to the good egg today for brunch. I've never been to the Good Egg, but have always wanted too and heard good things.  We were seated promptly, greeted and asked for our drinks. Shortly after the drinks were received, we ordered our food. The food came out very quickly, hot, as ordered.  Everyone at the table had various combinations of omlettes. Everything was very good and I enjoyed the hone style potatoes that came with my meal.   The jam at the table is also very good!   Definitely a place we will frequent from time to time for breakfast/brunch.   Staff was very friendly and location very clean.

I recently went to Abuelos with my wife for a date night before hitting the movies across the street. We were seated promptly.   I enjoyed my 4 enchilada plate. I've never had an avocado enchilada before.  I mixed up the other enchiladas with pork and beef with various sauces on top. The beans and rice were good and reminded me of what I'm used to in certain place ins California.   My wife had steak/shrimp fajitas. She enjoyed her meal. The only complain was the small amount of cheese, sour cream, etc that comes with the plate.  The steak was juice and tender and the shrimp was cooked nicely.  Our food came out quickly, as we ordered and hot.  The server was attentive.to our need, refills and also returned the check in a timely manner   Was this the best mexican fare I've had, no, but I definitely think the food is above average.  The inside wasn't what I normally think of at a Mexican place. Had a nice ambiance and atmosphere that I've grown accustomed to at most mexican places I've gone to throughout the US.  Overall, I was happy with the meal and experience and will be back again.

My favorite place to grab a sandwich and wrap. You can't go wrong with either a sandwich one. .Hard to name a favorite item, since I've enjoyed them all.    Items I enjoy most are the Humdinger (pastrami), Yahoo (roast beef) Dilly Club, Southwestern club and the Mexi, Caesar and Southwest Wraps  Sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and served with a pickle and one side-(chips, cookie)  I really enjoy the Poore Bros chips served here, especially the bbq ranch flavor. The cookies are also pretty good.  This location is less crowded then the Dilly's location closer to the ASU campus.

I usually don't shop at Bashas' and now I know why. I went to the Blockbuster store located in the same strip mall and realized I needed to get something for dinner that I didn't have. Not wanting to waste time driving to another store, I ran into here.  Upon walking in, I noticed how old and dirty this place was compared to other markets.  My wife was appalled at the conditions. Her comment to me after we walked out with our grocery bag "Let's never go here again"!  I've heard you save some money at Bashas', but I don't think that is the case. I found the prices to be about the same or in some cases more. The meat quality was poor (in my opinion).  Some of the check out stands were ones I recall when I was a kid in the 80's. The old turnstiles. I was shocked they had a price scanner given how ancient they were.   For me, Basha's doesn't even come close to Fry's, Safeway, Sunflower or Trader Joe's. Bashas' is well below the other chain super markets.

I swore off Sprint stores after several bad experiences in the Bay Area. After my trials, I I then decided to only work with Sprint by phone or online for any issues that I had.   Upon moving to the Phoenix area, I was told the Sprint store in Tempe was different. My opinion has now changed, at least for this Sprint store and the Technial shop next door.   I've had to go to this location a few times when my phone was having some issues a few months back. My phone issues were resolved and the customer service was very good each time. The staff was very nice and helpful. A big change from my previous experiences.  I went to the Sprint store on 11/27 to combine my plan with my wifes' plan. The store was pretty busy since this was Black Friday. Even with all the people, we were able to meet with a customer service rep within a few minutes and were still in and out of the store within 15 to 20 minutes.   I received a new Sprint phone as a gift yesterday and I had to head to the Sprint store to get the phone activated and transfer over my contact list. I was very pleased with the process. The duration of my time in the store was less than 10 minutes.

I've gone to Great Clips a few times in the past, but this was my first experience in Arizona. I was willing to give them a try, especially with a coupon on hand.   I waited about 5 minutes before the stylist saw me. Upon entering, I thought the wait was going to be longer as several folks were waiting. Fortunately for me, all the stylists wrapped up their customers at the same time..  I was seated in the chair and the stylist asked how I wanted my hair cut. She promptly did what I asked. She did a great job and was very happy with my haircut. The stylist was very pleasant and had a nice conversation, but not to the point she talked my ear off.    I was in and out within about 15 to 20 minutes. I'll take that anyday!

Sunflower is a great place to shop. I don't know if you can meet all your grocery shopping needs here, but you can come real close. The prices are pretty good. There are always great weekly deals on produce, meat and other grocery items!  Sunflower can be compared to Trader Joe's in some ways (in my opinion).   The produce is fresh and priced just right. There is a pretty wide variety of fruits and vegtables to choose from and there are always items on sale.   There is a nice meat selection of beef, chicken and poultry and also a meat counter for selected items. The chicken is superb. The quality of Chicken exceeds any other market around-Frys, Safeway.   There are various types of sausages you can get at the meat counter are excellent!  There are also several rows of bins that you can fill up a bag full of various types of  flour, rice, candy, nuts and dried fruit etc. Prices are usually around 1.99 to 4.99 per pound. This is a great thing for a recipe that calls for only a small amount of an item and you don't want to buy too much and go to waste. For example, recently, we wanted to add some sunflower seeds and dried cranberries to a salad. Instead of buying a package of both, I purchased a small amount of each item and none goes to waste. I also save a bit of money in the process.  The staff is friendly and I've never been in like for more than 5 minutes.

I lived at CityScape from July 2009 through August 2010. I enjoyed my stay there. If I didn't purchase a home, I would have no problem still staying at Cityscape.  Cityscape might be a bit more expensive than some apartments, but you get some nice perks.  There is a diverse group of folks that live here, students, young families and professional and some empty nesters. For the most part, the complex was generally quiet, at least on my end.  There are many things to like about CityScape. Cityscape is close to ASU, close to shopping and to many major freeways-60/10, 101.  The grounds are kept generally clean although I never enjoyed the 6:30 am lawn mover outside my window.  The inside of the apartments are nice with a decent size kitchen. I believe almost all units have washer and dryers included.  There is a nice clubhouse that has computers, tvs and dvd rentals. The staff also have several functions at the pool/clubhouse throughout the year.   Some really nice things about the complex is the nice pool. hot tub and patio area with propane BBQ. There is an onsite gym with several cardio machines, weight machines and free weights.  There are several BBQ pits located throughout the complex.  Maintenance was always friendly and quick to fix and issues,   There are a few items that weren't great. If you lived on the bottom floor like I did, you could often here your upstairs neighbors rather easily walking around or if they were super loud during an evening. You could also hear the washer later in the evening,   The front office went through some changes. During my tenure, there were 3 managers. We had some billing issues at the start of our. We received a move in bonus, but was not accounted for. This occurred two months in a row. One month we were only billed for water and garbage.  Part of it may have been new staff or just incompetence. Luckily, some of those folks were phased out.   With the recent rains there was also a nice lake that formed that would last for days. The water was several inches deep and would cover from the garage to the covered car port in my area facing Minton. This just doesn't look good, but was fun to drive through in my truck!  I also wish there was more than 1 recycling bin on the grounds, especially when the bin is on the opposite side. . Overall, Cityscape was a fun time and I would have no qualms recommending this location to anyone looking for a 1-3 bedroom apt. in the Tempe area.

The wife and I have gone here several times in the evening when we want a simple, casual and easy meal and we don't have the time to cook or feel like it.   Getting coupons in the mail or through the Sweet Tomatoes club definitely makes coming here more attractive-buy 1 meal, get 1 free . Hard to beat a meal for two for around $10.   The food has always been fresh with a wide variety of options to place on your lettuce. There are usually about 5 choices of soup/chili.  The Chinese Chicken salad is always a good option.  I enjoy the blueberry muffins.  We went here the other night and were treated to a pretty good strawberry and apple cobbler. In the past, we went when the dessert was carrott cake and that was very good.  The self serve ice cream is always a nice touch or to use and make a root beer float.  This location is usually busy, the couple of times we've gone  but not too loud.  We've only gone on Sunday evening and mid week though.

The Village Lanes is right off 60 and Rural, behind the Dennys.  This is one of the few bowling alleys that is both clean on the outside and on the inside. The building is well lit inside and has numerous lanes to bowl.   If you're coming with a large group, talk to the staff about specials they can offer you for the game(s), shoes etc in a combo package. You may end up saving a bit of money this way. The packages can includes soda, popcorn and pizza (if you wish to eat).  There is a bar/lounge if you want to drink with a pool table. Tthere is also video games to play.  Plenty of bowling balls to choose from in different colors.  If you're having a party/event, you can bring cake/cookies/cupcakes, Other outside food is not allowed.  A fun place to go with family or friends.

I've used Discount Tire in the past when I lived in California and was very pleased.. I had to replace all 4 tires in my truck and knew where I was going. I just had to find a shop close by.  I went online to the Discount Tire website, researched which tires I wanted and then made an appointment. I would definitely recommend setting an appointment online. This way you have priority over those customers that just walk in.  I showed up a few minutes before my scheduled appointment as requested when I made my appointment.. Upon arrival, I was greeted by someone, took a quick look at my tires and completed my transaction   The staff is friendly knowledgeable. The sales person didn't try to up sell me on different tires. A very hassle free experience.  My wife's car will be requiring new tires soon. When that time comes, I'll be going to Discount Tire.  The costs of the tires are very reasonable and there is a price match guarantee.  Great prices, great service!  Overall, the process to do my entire tire service on my truck took about 35 minutes.

I've used Midas in the past in CA for oil changes and brakes.  This is my first Midas experience in the Tempe area.  My truck was due for an oil change and tire rotation. I went in without an appointment and I was told the process would take about 30 minutes. There was another car already getting an oil change. I was glad I got in when I did. Shortly after I arrived, four more folks came in for an oil change.  The wait time was about 2 hours when the last guy came in.  Unless you get there when Midas opens, you may want to schedule an appointment to have your oil changed or take the chance your oil change may take several hours.   During the oil change, the service agent notified of a possible issue with my truck. He showed me the issue when the truck was on the lift and tires being rotated. I was appreciative that he told me to keep an eye on the problem. There was no pressure to fix the issue on the spot.  Staff was friendly and helpful.

I know little about windshields, glass, glass repair etc.  I was referred to American Glass by Tempe Auto Repair (whom I really like) when my wife's car had a cracked windshield. The crack was getting dangerous and needed to be fixed. American Glass is close to our home and after the referral, figured that this was a good decision.  I called and left a voice mail to set up an appointment. No call. My wife called again a few days later and the owner said there was no voice mail and maybe I called somewhere else. She wasn't very friendly. I had the business card and heard the American Glass message. I know where I called. Should have been my first warning.  My wife did take her car to get the window fixed as this needed to be done rather than shop around any longer.. This process went pretty well and the windshield was fixed the same day.   The big issue was dealing with my insurance company and American Glass. This process could have been handled better.  Within a month of the windshield being repaired  a rock hit my wife's windshield again and left a ding. My insurance company (State Farm) advised us to contact the Glass Company to repair the windshield as this should be under warranty and be fixed without cost or little cost..  We contacted American Glass and we were told that it would not be covered and we would have to pay for a new windshield at full cost. The woman was not very friendly in her handling of this issue. HMMMM! Forget that!   State Farm informed me that any reputable glass company would stand behind their work and offer to fix the problem. State Farm then provided us another provider to correct the ding in the windshield. (My wife will write a review on this).  I would suggest that you go somewhere else when getting a new windshield, repaired etc.   I can only warn others to steer clear of this business and the woman who runs this place.

Recently I had to take my truck to get an oil change. While I was getting my oil changed, I was notified of a problem with my water pump. I had a crack and was leaking pink coolant all over my engine. UGH!  After a recommendation from a friend and also an excellent experience with my wife's car (both Yelpers), I chose to take my truck to Tempe Auto Repair to be fixed.  When my wife took her car here to fix a problem, I talked with the shop about my potential issue. I was told to bring my truck in for a look and if there was a problem to write up a quote. The diagnosis was no charge.   . The staff is very professional and polite, especially Bill.  The cost of the repair was around $250-275 cheaper than another quote I had received for the same work and parts. The work was completed as scheduled, same day as long as I brought my truck in before 9 am.  I hope I don't have another issue with my truck for some time, but if I do, I'm headed back to Tempe Auto Repair because of the honesty, integrity and price. Good work Tempe Auto Repair!  I would recommend checking out Tempe Auto repair if your vehicle needs repair service

If you enjoy hot dogs, get to Ted's ASAP!  Ted's is a great place to have a charcoal grilled hot dog with all the sides.  There are other items on the menu (sandwiches, burgers), but I've always stuck with the staple hot dog and fries. One day I will try a burger and a milkshake.  Hard to beat Ted's classic meal of a hot dog, drink and either fries or onion rings.  This is a no frills place, good food, good service and old school charm.  The place can get very busy! Be prepared to wait in line and/or wait for a table to sit.  I'm a bit ashamed that I never wrote a review of Ted's earlier. I thought I had and then realized I never did. Better late than never.

How I've missed you old friend! I haven't been to Ted's in some time, but took my brother in law from out of town there. Ted's hasn't changed, same great food and long line!   Can't beat the way they cook a hot dog. I also tried a shake for the first time. The shake wasn't the best I've had, but definitely very good. I'd get another shake there anytime.

My wife and I have used Del Rey for a variety of dry cleaning needs. Each time the job was done well and ready for pick up as stated on the bill.  I was hesitant to get my suit cleaned here. Would they do a good enough job? I went ahead and had my suit cleaned and they did a great job at a better price and cleaning then places that charge more. I was very pleased. My suit will be taken back here to be dry cleaned when appropriate.  All items are $2.25. Laundered dress shirts that are pressed are less. I think the cost is 1.50 per shirt.  The staff is always propmpt and ready to serve. The last time I came in, I walked in and approached the counter and the manager (I assume) talking with someone else off to the side, apologized for the wait and someone would be there momentarily. I was waiting for roughly 20 seconds before a young lady assisted me. This shows that Del Ray is committed to their customers and getting them in and out as quickly as possible.  There are also  coupons available as you walk out from other businesses in the area. A great way to try something out or save a few bucks. My personal favorite coupon is the buy 1 blizzard get 1 free from Dairy Queen.

I made a appt. to put 4 new tires on my wife's car. I showed up and was immediately greeted and processed. All the work was done within 30 minutes. My appt. was at 8:30 am and was home by 9:10 am.  Every Discount Tire location I've visited has always been fast, knowledgeable and friendly! This location was no different.  If you need new tires or tire work, hit Discount Tire!

Ever since I've been introduced to Mongolian Grill, I've been hooked. This is the only place I've gone to in AZ   I like that  the bowl of food is one price and includes rice, soup, drink and soft service yogurt. Kids price is based on age so you don't end up paying a ton for food they may not eat. If you need to go for round two, it's only an extra $1.   The staff has always been friendly and helpful and facility clean. The staff is willing to help get you the right sauce. I think this is helpful for people who've never gone or want to experiment.   I do wish this place provide a few more vegetable options and some more sauces. Some of the other locations I've gone too in CA or MD have double these items and can make for a unique dish.  My advise is layer and pack your meats, veggies to the best of your ability to maximize what you can fit into your bowl. I get meat, pack down, add veggies and then noodles and push down, add some more meat and then push down and then get cooked.  The grillmaster serves up your food quickly.  I've been lucky when I've gone it's been before the dinner rush.   Be careful when you take your food back as it will require some cooling off time.  Plan to head back many times.....  Kids might dig the yogurt, but I didn't like the taste.

Are you looking to get a cat? if so, check out PetSmart. My wife and I adopted a kitten here and she's awesome.  There are always several cats (occasionally dogs) looking for a good home, some older cats (a few years old and some kittens.) There is an adoption fee, but the cats will come with their shots and are neutered/spayed.  We also use this store to get both wet and dry food and toys on occasion. There are many sizes and brands to choose from at good prices. The food is cheaper at PetSmart than Petco, unless the item is on sale.  I would recommend to get a PetSmart card to save a few bucks.  The store is always clean and staff very friendly and helpful.

Scottsdale Stadium is an awesome ballpark! Yes, I'm a bit biased since I'm a relocated Giants fan living in Arizona.  Even a non Giants fan would appreciate the stadium and great location to watch a game. You know the stadium is a draw for other fans when several people are wearing several hats and shirts of other teams not playing..  The stadium is in the heart of Scottsdale and easy walking distance to many places to eat drink.   Parking can be a burden, unless you know where you are going. I hit a free spot a couple blocks away around 2nd and just off Scottsdale. Many other places charge anywhere from $5-10.   There is a large gift shop on the first base side  Better than the small stand at most places. This shop can meet all your spring training and Giants needs.  There are many places to get food and drink throughout the ballpark, including the usual ballgame food (hot dogs, nachos), bbq, kettle corn, gelato and the noodle bowls. Like all spring training sites, the cost of food and beverages is absurd. This might be the most expensive location for good and drinks.   Hard to beat watching the game in the lawn near the right field foul pole, lawn or standing in the OF near centerfield. I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. One day, I'd like to watch a game from the terrace out in right field. That would be a great way to spend the afternoon.  Can't wait to head back in a few days.

I enjoy the charm of the old style ice cream parlor in Old Town Scottsdale.. I've tried a couple of different items on the ice cream menu and I haven't been disappointed.  Can't go wrong with any sundae or other ice cream creation on the menu.   Next time I'm going back, I'm shooting for a shake or ice cream soda.  There is also regular food served here (salads, burgers, sandwiches), but I've yet to try that.  The service has been a bit slow getting your treat, water and check from my experience.  .

I had my first Cowboy Ciao experience this past Saturday. I had the "Pig and Puddin" (yes, that is the name). I believe this dish is only served during lunch. The atmosphere was very nice and the staff was great.  The meal was superb. The pulled pork was very tender and seasoned perfectly. The meat was placed on top of some polenta. The polenta was very rich, but wasn't served with a huge portion. There was also some dried cranberries and baby pumpkin seeds on top of the pork to top off the dish..   I wouldn't have thought these items would go well together, but they did.  My wife has been here several times and really enjoys the food, especially the Stetson Salad.

This is a very large club with several different locations to hang. My friends and I caught Rock Lobster last night. The show was great, the place was packed and into the music. A fun scene.   The show right before Rock Lobster wasn't nearly as great and glad I was only tortured for a short time.   My friends and I reserved a table with bottle service. The only bad thing is the waitress had to pour the drinks which caused a delay at times.   My favorite part of the evening was being on the floor closer to the music and seeing the table next to us try and take our Vokda and couldn't figure out the lock top. The waitress promptly took the bottle back.  Good times. The should have concentrated on their own bottle since they left about half when they left.

My wife and I have been looking for a good Italian place in the area for some time. Another couple took us to dinner at Pasta Brioni. They've been going there for years and raved about the place..  The bread served before the meal was very good and warm. Much to my liking.  Before the main meal, we ordered a caesar salad. The salad was good, but nothing exceptional. The salad was by far the least favorite part of the meal.   The pasta and pasta sauce was very good. I went with a very basic dish of rigatoni bolganese.  The dish was very good and had lots of food.   After filling up on bread, salad and our meal, we couldn't go for dessert, but split one. We had the chocolate ice cream in a hard shell, with hazlenut with whipped cream. The dessert was really good. I couldn't have eaten the dish by myself, but splitting it was a perfect way to end the meal with something on the sweet side.  Nice atmosphere in the dining room and bar area. The decor provided a nice ambiance to the evening.   Service was very good! The waiter was very attentive to our needs and water was refilled in a prompt manner.  I plan on heading back there in the near future and trying other dishes..

I've been to Frashers a few times. Each time the service has been great and the food wonderful!   The steaks are great and I've never had a better pork chop then here. The pork chop is also thick and juicy. A real delight!  The roasted corn as a side is outstanding. If you like corn, that is a must side. I believe the corn is only offered seasonally though.  You can choose to eat in the dining room or in a little more casual setting in the bar area. Be warned there is TV on there with sports and ESPN. Needless to say, I don't get to sit in this area!  This is a perfect place for a nice dinner with friends/family or a romantic dinner with your significant other.

I recently went to GB on a Tuesday night with some friends for a drink or two around 8 pm. The place was not busy at all. There were only a few patrons here. The place was a ghost town.   We sat down in the cocktail area and waited and waited for someone to come over to take our order. Nobody ever came. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes, we left. The hostess in the stairway was shocked we were leaving so soon.. We told her why.  I can understand a wait when the place is busy, but when there is almost nobody there, this is inexcusable!  I really liked going to GB, but this night GB was subpar.

Everytime I'm in AZ, I have to hit Dilly's at least once for lunch. The sandwiches are great and I really enjoy the wraps (maybe even more). The Poore Bros. chips are amazing! Can't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu.

Now that I'm living in AZ full time, I need to hit Dilly's as often as I can. The sandwiches and wraps are still great! The Poore Bros chips are still fantastic. I'm a big fan of the BBQ Ranch flavor. I never stray from the goodness of these flavor of chips.  My favorites sandwiches are the humdinger, dilly club and then the mexi, southwest and chicken cesar wraps  You can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices on the menu. The cookies are very tasty!  All sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and come with your choice of a side and a pickle spear.  During the peak lunch hour, you wait in line a bit or struggle to find a table to sit.. Order usually come out within 5-10 minutes during peak time.

A great place my wife and her friends alerted me to. Tucked away in a market, this place services excellent middle eastern food.    I order the gyro platter.The plate is huge and comes with a huge salad, large amount of rice and gyro meat.  I couldn't get enough of the rice. This is my second favorite rice after Moby Dick (east cost) My only complaint is you receive only a small ll piece of flat bread to go with the meal.  I also appreciate the large water glass and not a small glass that requires several refills over the course of a meal.  Payment is done at the market register.  You receive excellent value for what you pay for. A meal for two will cost about $15 (or less)   I will be going back to this place again and again!

Good portions at a reasonable price. I honestly think you can buy one entree and split with a friend/spouse and have enough food for the both of you. I can eat quite a bit and still have enough food for lunch the following day.  The gyro platter was very good. The meat was well cooked and seasoned. The platter also consists of a nice portion of vegtables (carrots, squash, carrots), potatos and rice. You also get a few pieces of pita.  The hummus platter as an appetizer is excellent. There are 3 different types of hummus (regular, sun dried tomato and another kind that I can't recall). I wish they would provide more pita bread with the appetizer though.  You can choose to sit inside or choose covered outside seatiing.   There is also a full bar for drinks.  Service was pretty good.

I've only been to La Fonda one time. I ordered the carne asada and was excellent. The best carne asada I've had at a Mexican place.  I've had my fair share living in CA, TX and now AZ. This place tops them all.  I'll go back w/o a doubt to try other menu items!

Each Spring Training facility has it's own quirks and things that make it special. Hohokam Park  where the Cubs play is no different.   Upon parking, I walk towards the stadium and see people tailgating. Now, this wouldn't be weird for a regular season game, but I've never seen this at any other location around Arizona. I thought that was cool. I was even able to buy a lawn seat for just $5 off one of these guys instead of the ticket window.  The Cubbie fans are very passionate and make their voice heard here. I'd thought the seventh inning stretch here was cool. Not quite Wrigley, but what is? Wearing a Giants hat, I was only heckled one time, but that guy was heckling anything and everything not in Cubs white, red and blue during the game. Minus this one guy, everyone else was very cool and friendly.  There is lots of room in the lawn and places to eat and drink and also a restroom behind center field.   It's hard to go more than 15-20 feet without a beer stand or beer vendor walking by. You won't go thirsty at this place! I will have Bud, Miller and Old Style ringing in my head for a long time now.  If you are going to eat, go to Chuckie's on the third base side, near the left field foul pole. I've never had a breaded pork tenderloin sandwich before, but this was very good! You can get a combo with some awesome waffle fries for $9. The sandwich by itself is $8 and the fries are $4 solo.   There is many other food options to go with if you want the standard hot dogs, nachos etc.  The downside to this place has to be the parking. As I turned onto Central towards the park, there was a long line waiting to park in the stadium lot. I ended up parking a short distance from the stadium, right before the cemetary in big lot that a couple home owners use for parking. The cost was $5.   Another winner in my book!

I enjoyed the char grilled burgers here very much. The meat is fresh when placed on the grill. Once your burger is cooked, you put all the side on (as little or as much as you want).   Fries are good, but not great.  Has a relaxed atmosphere. The place always is busy when I go or drive by.

If I didn't live near Classic Italian, I would never know this place existed. The location is tucked away a strip mall just off Minton and Lakeshore. The closest major streets are Rural and Baseline.  Classic Italian values their food and quality of their product. Case in point. I ordered an Italian Sausage pizza for pickup. I arrived to pick up the pizza and the guy handling the pizza tells me that it will be a few extra minutes. He had to redo my pizza since it wasn't perfect. There was too much burned crust on the bottom. Nothing worse than a pizza charred on the bottom. I'm glad he took the extra time to make my pizza right.  Upon getting home, the pizza was great. The pizza is thin and covered generously with your toppings. The sausage on the pizza was really tasty.   Pizzas are between $10-15. Each pizza is 8 slices.   There is a small patio outside to enjoy pizza with heaters (if needed).   The interior is nicely decorated and has a very intimate feel of a classy place. This isn't your neighborhood pizza joint.  Looking forward to my next experience at Classic Italian.

I had my first dining experience at Classic Italian. Prior to last night, I always had carry out since I lived around the corner.  We ordered the gourmet salad and we all thought the miso dressing just didn't go with this salad. That was the opinion of all 3 of us at the table.  The real reason we went here is for the pizza. Of course, we weren't disappointed. The Toscana was awesome! I ate almost the entire pizza myself. The salami, olives, cheese and crust were perfect!  The basil/garlic/cheese (can't recall the name) was also very good.   The service was okay. After the pizza arrived, we didn't see the server again to refill our water. The place wasn't very busy, with just a few tables full.   Want a good homemade, fresh pizza, look no further than Classic Italian!

When you want a burger and don't feel like Wendy, Mcdonalds etc, grabbing a burger and fries here is pretty good. The burger is made to order and the bun is great. I really like the fresh topping bar with lettuce, tomato etc.  Having a little cheese sauce to dunk my fries in is a a bit difference. While I wouldn't want all my fries like this, a few does the trick.  I took a bite and of my wife's hot dog and was really good. The hot dog was grilled well and had nice flavor. The bun was also tasty.  Coke products are served here.  The service was fast the decor on the wall is different, but cool.  I will definitely be back!

This is just like your average Target store. The store is always nice and clean. The items I've come for have always been in stock. Target prices are tough to beat for most items. Plenty of parking is available.  The reason this location is marked down for me is the grocey section is much smaller than the location in Tempe Marketplace and one worker there. The rest of the staff has always been nice and helpful.  There is also one really rude male register worker. He's been a jerk to me and my wife and both of us on seperate occasions. I'm happy to tell the story if you are really eager to hear offline. He acts like he doesn't want to be there and is not very friendly. If you see a young kid, with an emo type hairdo, save yourself some trouble and go to another line.   This location inlcudes a snack bar and the restrooms are clean.

DQ is a great place to grab a dessert and the best place of any of the other fast food establishments hands down. You have several options to go with, shake, sundaes, cones or my favorite (and many others) the Blizzard!   For those that don't know, the blzzard is ice cream mixed with your favorite topping or candy bar (Oreos, Twix, Butterfinger, Nestle Cruch, M&M's etc). A real treat!  Each time I've gone, the dessert has always been ready within in a few minutes. The one time I went through the drive through, we were in and out within 3 minutes.  I typically don't go to DQ to eat a regular meal. Once in a while I will get the chicken finger basket, which is a few chicken strips, fries, a piece of toast and gravy. Very Good!  The burgers are ok, but if I was in the mood for a burger, I'd hit another establishment. Just my preference.

The staff is always friendly and helpful if you need to locate an item.  There are many great items to choose from here and the prices are very affordable. I think the one exception is some fruits and vegtables can be a little expensive for the amount you get. I normally don't shop for produce. Depending on the time of year, they have some real good prices on blackberries and strawberries.  I would encourage you to try the flat bread or pita bread with TJ's hummus and the pizza dough and sauce to make your own pizza at home.  TJ's also has a wide selection of wine and beer that would fit almost any budget.

My wife and I ate at Lychee Inn yesterday night for dinner for the first time. We've been wanting to try this place out for some time since we live very close and heard good things from several different people. We are both glad we finally decided to go.  The menu is very diverse with many pork, chicken, beef, seafood and rice and noodle options.  We decided to order pork fried rice, beef with snow peas and moo shoo chicken along with the complimentary tea and white rice. All dishes were fresh, hot and served to us within 10 minutes of our order. We had plenty of food left over and gave me another meal today.  The pork fried rice was a little bit different from what I've grown up eating in California, but still good nonetheless. The rice was darker and had bean sprouts. The moo shoo also came pre-wrapped. Other places I've eaten ate you always filled your own pancake. Either way, I still have the food inside spill out.  The main dining room isn't especially big, but has several booths and table to sit at.   There is a small bar inside if you wish to have a drink during dinner.  There are daily lunch specials for under $7. I'm going to head back this week or next week to enjoy one of the lunch specials.

I've been to Totts a few times now. I've dined in and carried out. I really enjoy the food here. I've tried a few different items, but my favorite dish is the Pan Fried Noodles served with beef.  The mixture of the noodles covered with beef, veggies and the oyster sauce is terrific. This item is FANTASTIC in my opinion! Each time I finish the dish, I wish I had more!   The staff is super nice and always go over your order to make sure you receive the items you requested.  One item that I've tried that I wasn't keen on was the Tom Yum Soup. The soup was spicy, but was about it. Nothing filling about it.  The food has always came quickly when I've dined in. Both times I've picked up for carryout, the food was ready as advertised. The food is usually ready for pick up within 10 minutes of your order.   The prices are very reasonable. Each main dish is generally between $6.50 and $9.00. Items with seafood will be a bit more expensive, maybe a bit over the $9 mark  A very good meal for under $10 (excluding drink)

I've now been to several hockey games and one concert at Jobing.com since I moved to the area mid 2009.  The arena is just across the street from the U of Phoenix stadium where the Cardinals play. Jobing.com arena is very nice and clean both inside and outside. The arena is staffed by courteous and nice people (ushers, ticket takers etc). I've haven't sat in a bad seat yet for an event   Compared to other arenas, the scoreboard is a bit outdated though. .   There are numerous concessions to choose from inside the arena from staples like hot dogs and nachos and drinks to Boars Head Sandwiches and Hooters. Yes, there is Hooters food served here, but don't expect the waitresses you would be accustomed to at other locations. If you are, you'll be sadly disappointed!  One thing I really like about the arena is the fountains, shops and places to eat and drink just outside the arena in the Westgate Mall..There are lots of choices to choose from eating wise. Some places being very casual, some festive and others a bit more upscale.   Parking is free for hockey games and the one concert I've attended. That beats paying $20 or more at other places.  The only downside is the trek to get out to Glendale. I wish the arena was closer and traffic not so bad. I'd head to more events if a 30-40 minute drive didn't turn into an hour to an hour and a half just to get there!

I've been to Big City twice. I've always been happy with the BBQ i've received-ribs and pulled pork. The sides were good, but not great.   I haven't had them, but I understand the sugar biscuit desserts are great. I will need to try them next time.  Place is clean and ample parking. Staff is friendly.  I will go back to Big City.

I was not impressed with Los Sombreros. This is a tough thing for me to say because I adore Mexican food. Living in CA, TX and now AZ, I think I've had my fair share of Mexican food and this place doesn't measure up by a long shot.. The food  is very average and fairly expensive for what you get.   The portions were okay, but I still left unsatisfied and hungry..  There are plenty of good Mexican places that serve way better food at almost half the price of Los Sombreros entrees.   I thought the salsa was excellent. Service was decent.  I'm feeling generous-2.5 stars

Each time I've hit the Gelato spot, the place has been BUSY!    There are many flavors too choose from. I generally go with the fruit flavors with Strawberry, Mango and Pineapple being my favorite.   After my last trip, I indulged myself and went back for a third scoop, this time going the chocolate route. The chocolate was just as good as the fruit flavors.  I could eat several scoops of Gelato Spot on a daily basis and never get tired of it!  If you enjoy Gelato, you should get to Gelato Spot!  There is a nice patio to enjoy your gelato as well.

When my AC broke,  I had to make a temporary stay at the Grace Inn. I was pleasantly surprised for my day plus stay.  The room was a nice size and fit my wife and baby comfortably. Nothing was extravagant, but suitable for our needs.   The room was also very affordable. I'm sure the room is much more expensive during peak tourist season  The room was clean and floor was pretty quiet.. There was a small mini frig in the room.  The decor is a bit outdated.  I would feel comfortable in having friends or relatives stay here when visiting iif I couldn't accommodate them.  There is a pool area, restaurant and a business center. I was a bit disappointed that the business center required you to pay to access the internet. Not really conducive for business.  The lobby has plenty of places to sit and chat .  The Inn is right off the 10 and is walking distance to a strip mall and a short drive to many other places to shop and eat on Elliott/Warner or Ray.

This place has been thoroughly reviewed by many folks. What else can I say, but this place has some good food. I went with the spare rib tacos and came away happy and full. You receive a generous portion of meat and then the salsa, guac etc. The tortillas are great.  The service was very good. My wife has gone there many times in the past and said the service was the one area of concern.  One thing that i find weird is the entrance is right next to where you pick up the food. That is a disaster waiting to happen!   A great meal for a very reasonable price. A definite winner!

I took my wife to Bloom for her birthday (at her request). I had reservations, but ended up not really needing them. Better to be safe than sorry.  We were seated promptly and a waiter provided water and took our drink our very quickly.  For an appetizer, we ordered the chicken tacos! You don't get many, but what you do get are really good!  My wife had the lobster plate and lover it. I went with the bbq pork. The pork pretty much came out looking like a steak with a light layer of bbq sauce underneath. The meat was very good and had no fat.  On the side was mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was a bit different than what you typically think of mac and cheese (less cheesy). The one thing that threw me off was the sea salted watermelon slice. It's different, but just didn't do it for me.  I would have rather had the watermelon without the sea salt.   Overall, my wife and I enjoyed our meal. We'll head back when we want a nice meal, with good portions.  The service was really good and our server was very attentive to our needs.

I've eaten at the IKEA cafe twice now. The first time was average. I had the Chicken and Penne pasta. The meal was decent, but nothing great.  Recently during another outing, I went with the chicken tenders and fries. The tenders were really good and enjoyed the fries. Next time I eat here, I have a good idea what I'm going to eat. I still need to get the Swedish Meatballs at some point.  The mac and cheese as a side is decent. It's not Lo Lo's!  A primary concern eating here is the person getting your food doesn't understand English well or speaks English well. While ordering my tenders and fries, she started to serve me another menu item. Luckily another lady understood and corrected the problem. I had a similar issue with the same lady when I ordered the chicken and pasta in an earlier visit to know this wasn't a one off issue.  There is also a snack bar near the check out area with hog dogs and other snacks. The allure of cinnamon rolls is hard to resit.

IKEA must stand for, you can find almost any item you are looking for under the roof.  IKEA has some cool items and our home has many IKEA related items-china cabinet, plates, kitchen items etc. In time, our house will take on even more items.  While I wouldn't purchase all home items here, there is certainly value and practicality in several items located here. The items are of pretty good quality and not terribly expensive. I'd rather own IKEA items, then some of the other furniture places items that are in the general area of this location.  Do yourself a favor and avoid going here during the week. The store is less crowded.in the evening during the week. You don't have to walk a 1/4 mile or more to the entrance and deal with the other hundreds (or more people and courts cruising around the floor. I'm sure the crowds on the weekend are due to this being the only location in the greater Phoenix area.  I wish all shopping carts were like the ones you get at IKEA!

I've been to the Big Bang a few times, always on a Fri or Sat night. Each time has been great. The dueling pianos are fun to hear and go back and forth. The players do an excellent job of getting the crowd going. Each player provides his/her own personality when playing.   The drinks are reasonable and you're served pretty quick. There are some tubs full of bottled beer scattered along the floor if you don't want to wait at the bar..  The only drag is that with the music going on, it can be very hard to hear someone talking with you.

I took a stroll to Changing Hands after eating at Wildflower. I was impressed by the store and the selection of new and used books  The store is very clean and laid out in such a way that you can find your favorite category of reading  rather easily (History, Fiction etc)   There is a good sized childrens section full of books, games, toys..   Up front there is a selection of the newest releases as well as recommended books by the staff on the wall.   There is also a sizable amount of books at bargain price in the front and back of the store.   Fighting the temptation to buy more, I hung tough and just bought one book for a Christmas gift and a cool Christmas ornament.   Based on this experience, I will definitely be back to buy books in the near future. Now I ask myself, why did I not come here earlier?  There is going to be a 25% off sale on Jan. 1, 2010.

I can't speak for dinner, but I've been here twice for brunch and the foods is fantastic.  The brunch prices are very reasonable, 8-14ish  The bread that is served with your meal is awesome. Dip in the olive oil. pesto mixture and you could just eat this for a meal. I know I had a few slices before my meal even arrived. The bread was that good!  The chorizo breakfast burrito is big, flavorful and can match any appetite (including mine). There is fresh pico in the side and some tasty fried potatoes. A good hearty meal  Nice atmosphere. A winner for brunch. The two people my wife and I took here from out of town enjoyed themselves and the food.

I can now check off the Philly Sandwich company off my list to eat at.   Stopping off was the perfect ending to a long night of being out on the town. The philly sandwich was big and tasted great. I could have gone for it being a bit cheesier though (my personal preference). The fries were great and not too greasy.   Two phillys, 2 sodas and 2 fries totaled $25.  My friend and I got in just at the right time before the bar scene left out. I received my food within about 7-10 minutes. We ate at the counter and then before we knew it, the place was packed. I can see why. Who doesn't want some tasty good after a long night at the bars/clubs?  I could probably do without the DJ music.  I will definitely be back. Next time I hope not to be there at 2 am!

Once again, the Hyatt Place hits a home run. This is the second time I've stayed at a Hyatt Place and my experience was just as good as the first time. The layout was practically the same. Whenever I walked in, I was promptly greeted.  The room was clean and fresh and big! You can easily have a small family in one room and not feel two crowded. You have the extra large couch to relax. T  This might be a strange thing to place, but the shower head was awesome.  There is a pool at this location as well as the breakfast in the morning.  This place is very close to Old Town Scottsdale and within a few minutes of lots of shopping, places to eat etc. .  There was a location to use the internet, which was nice. Some places charge for even just a short period of time.

Went here for lunch with 3 coworkers recently. We were promptly seated and greeted and had our drinks within minutes. This is the second time I've had Velle Luna food. The first time was   I ordered the combination place with enchilada, taco and, rice and beans. The meal was solid with the exception of the rice, which I thought was a bit dry. I didn't like the big onions in the enchilada, but that is a personal preference and at least I was able to take those out.  Overall, the service level was very good and the food in my opinion was also above average.  My coworkers ordered a variety of menu items and all enjoyed their meals, but couldn't finish them.  I would say that Valle Lune has some pretty solid food and would go back there without hesitation.

My visit to Va Bene was a tale of two meals. Since a salad doesn't come with your entree, I ordered a caesar salad, big mistake! The salad was awful. The salad was small and the dressing tasted almost like mayo. I had my wife take a bite to make sure I wasn't wrong in my assessment.   When the server asked how the salad was, I honestly told her the salad wasn't good. The look on her face was priceless. I sucked it up and ate my salad. I hate to see $9 go down the drain.  My meal was better. I had the Rigatoni, sausage, peppers in a cream sauce.  I liked the dish quite a bit, but I was still a little scorned from the salad fiasco.   Entree 4 stars Salad 0  stars  The service was decent. The inside was nice and had a nice atmosphere. I can see why people like this place.  To me, this place is more flash.  I don't plan to head back to this place. If you do go, I'd avoid the salad. I think other Italian places in the area give you better food at the same/cheaper rate and overall provide better value for your dollar.  Just my 2 cents.

Great place for breakfast or lunch. I really like the low carb menu. Friendly staff. Get there early as there can usually be a long line because of the great food.

Where to begin. I've gone to the Arizona Mills theatres a few times now. The prior times have always been a good experience. That changed last night.   Last night I went out on a date night with my wife. The theatre itself is fine. The screen is big, there is stadium seating and is reasonably clean for as many people seeing a show.   The place was busy when we saw the show at 7:15 and was packed when we exited the movies 2 hours later. As I left the movie, the concession stand was about 10 deep in about 6-8 lines.   This is what I had to deal with last night: -A crying baby at a rated R movie. The crying was throughout the movie and the parent was alone. I think the baby must have been upset with the violence and nudity on screen. WHY do this to a baby and the other patrons? -people consistently checking their phone to check a text/voice mail -People talking to the screen or chatting with their neighbor -A mother allowing her young child to treat the stairs like a personal jungle gym during the movie. The child was up towards the top and would run up and down. Again, why bring a baby or young children to a rated R movie? Hire a babysitter and have a few hours alone!   I think the next time I check a movie out here, I'll stick to mid afternoon or stick to Tempe Marketplace..

I'm a big baseball fan and I was very impressed by the Peoria Sports Complex. I witnessed my first game here yesterday when I watched the Mariners and Giants (my team) play.  There are plenty of places to eat near the park on Bell if you don't want to eat inside the stadium and pay the higher prices..   As far as inside the stadium, there are plenty of concessions, drink carts and specialty stands that line the complex.  If you sit in the bleachers you have lots of options out there.  I was going to get the Ruthian hot dog (foot long) towards the middle of the game. I ended up eating a Brat because the last Ruthian was just sold before I ordered and would take at least 10 minutes to cook one. Bummer!   Personally, I enjoy watching most spring training games from the lawn. You get to soak in the sun, have a bit more space to stretch out and food, drink and restrooms were close by here.  Lawn seats are just $6. The lawn is the best place to sit if you have a larger group or have kids. Lawn chairs are prohibited.  Restrooms were clean, even towards the end of the game.  Parking was $5. There was plenty of parking available. There was only a slight delay exiting the stadium onto Bell to 101. I ended up going through the light on Bell, made the first U turn I could and then took a right on Bell towards 101. That may have saved a few minutes instead of waiting to turn left on Bell.  The only downside I see is the high price of food and drinks. I assume souvenirs were just as pricey ( I didn't check). This complaint will be said over and over at any spring training stadium or pro stadium though.     Even if you aren't a fan of the Padres/Mariners or team they are playing, I'd check this stadium out. It's a fun experience.  What beats a ball game with friends in the sun, drink in one hand and hot dog in another? Not much!

Finally, I've been able to see a game at Municipal Stadium. The last time I went to a game in 2006, the game was rained out.  There isn't a bad seat in the house. The stadium is a bit smaller than several other locations. I enjoyed watching the game from the seats towards the outfield.  I enjoyed seeing the background of the Papago rocks behind left field. A nice touch.  One real nice thing about Municipal is the parking. There is a large parking lot across the street. Cost is $5.  I did have a tasty corn dog here. Not overcooked and the hog dog inside wasn't shriveled or overcooked. It was possibly the best corn dog I've had in a LONG time. Even better than the fair!  What brings down the rating is that the is ZERO lawn seats (my favorite place to watch a spring training game), not much variety of food and the smoking. The smoking was a big issue. There were countless folks smoking as I was wandering around the stadium. I went to the restroom and there were people smoking between the stands and restroom/concessions. UGH I thought there was some ordinance that if you smoked, you had to go outside the stadium?  Municipal is a fun and great place to watch a game, but falls short of some of the other stadiums in the area for me.

Walking in, I could tell this is my type of place. There is a casual atmosphere where you can enjoy hanging out with friends and enjoy some food/drink or watch a game. There are many large and smaller tv's to catch the game. The NFL package is offered here..  Tuesday is .40 wing night. You must order in 6's, 6, 12, 18 etc and you can mix/match your sauces.  As for the wings, the wings were very good, but not the best I've had. The wings do rank towards the top. There are several flavor selections to choose from starting at the very mild to the very hot. Most other places I've had wings (minus Hooters), the customer was provided a side of ranch, bleu cheese with your wings. At BWW, they charge you for your first dressing. I think you should get one side free and if you want any additional dressings, then you charge. I feel that is more than fair.  There is a monthly beer special of 23 oz of beer for $3.25. October is Coors Light as I found out last night. A pretty good price for really 2 beers. What I could tell, there is a decent amount of beers to choose from on tap.  Someone at my table ordered fries. I had a few and although they weren't great, they weren't terrible either, just average small cut fries. To me, they reminded me of Dairy Queen fries.  The service was very good and the waiter was very attentive to our needs and without asking split the check up for our entire party. A nice touch.  I'm sure I'll be back enjoying some wings and a beer or two.

If you want assistance or some help, don't come to this Lowe's. I went to Lowe's for a particular item with the pending cold weather. Upon walking into the garden section I asked a worker for an item. She stated to me she wasn't sure if the item was in stock, but if it was it would be over there and pointed to an area. Not very helpful.  A bit frustrated, I went to customer service to see if the item was in stock. At least the lady working the desk knew that item was out of stock.   At least take the effort to show me where the  item was and not send me on a blind hunt.  Lowe's might have the best Nascar driver around, but this Lowe's lacks in customer service. Won't be going to this location again.

Everyone knows you can get bulk items at Costco and other items (electronics cheaper). My rating is going to be about other features.  The Tempe Costco is far different than the locations I've experienced in California (San Jose, Mt. View, Sunnyvale etc). This Costco always has ample lanes open and rarely have I seen a line more than 2 or 3 carts deep. I think the longest I've waited in line is 10 minutes. At Costco, that is superb. Most times, the wait is no more than 5 minutes and I've gone at all times during the week and weekend.    I never understood why you would have 15 registers, but only half open (espeically on weekends). This Costco always seems to have the right amount of registers open with very few idle to meet the demand of the customers.  The Staff is always willing to assist you with an item. The folks handing out samples are very friendly and provide information on the product.  Restrooms are also clean.  The only downside of Costco is the parking situation. Although the parking isn't nearly as bad as other locations I've gone too, you still have to deal with issues as carts in parking spots or stray carts because folks are too lazy to place in the proper location. Another issues is people blocking traffic to get that closer spot even if the parked car is just starting to load their items and takes 5 minutes to do so. Do yourself a favor and park in the area where less cars are at. More often than not, you'll be walking by the folks who are still waiting to park. The stray carts still might be a problem.  I'm always a fan of the snack bar and the many food items and treats you get here. $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, the pizza for 1.99 etc.    Remember, Costco, only accepts Cash, Debit, Amex or check.

After working down the street from Freddy's for a year and half and wanting to go, I finally went with a coworker who raved about the place.  I ordered the # 1 combo, burger, drink and fries. The meal was just under $7.  The burger is fresh and very good and enjoyed my burger. I wouldn't say it's my favorite burger, but it's in the upper echelon especially in the Phoenix Area..   One thing that stands out is the pickles that are served on the burger. I've never had  long sliced pickles on a burger, usually just pickle chips. I wish ketchup came on the burger, but you can add this yourself.  Fries were good, could have used a little more than the small scoop I received.    I will definitely go back and maybe next time opt for a custard or sweet treat.

Until recently, I've never had a Papa Murphy's pizza. When my daughter was born,  a church member dropped off a pizza for my family to enjoy. We cooked the pizza and enjoyed the pizza very much.  I wanted more, but the pizza was all gone.  Since the pizza was dropped off, I've gone back twice to indulge in the pizza.. The last two times I've made the short trek to the store to order and pick up the pizza myself.  The ingredients are fresh, made to order and is done quickly. You're in and out within just a few minutes. There are many ingredients to choose from, all the standard dare-meats, cheese and toppings.  The staff is very friendly and courteous.  Become a member of the Papa's Murphy's online club and get coupons or go to the website to save a little bit on your next order.  I will be back again and again.

After our trip to the zoo we looked for a place to grab lunch. Checking Yelp, my wife, friend and I decided on this location.   I had the Cobb wrap and was very pleased. Could have used a little more balsamic for my liking.  I don't recall what my wife and her friend had, but I know they enjoyed their sandwich and wrap they split.   The menu isn't large, but has a good variety of options, sandwich, wraps, salads  and moderately priced.  Enjoyed some nice brewed ice tea, which tasted really good after being in the hot sun and walking around for a few hours at the zoo.   My wife ordered the watermelon lemonade, something I've never had. I had a little bit and was pretty good. Definitely a refreshing treat. I don't believe that is a regular menu item.  The mini chocolate cookie with white chocolate chips was awesome!   Has a small play area for kids with a table and blocks. My little one enjoyed this while the good came out.  I'd definitely head back to Bertha's!

I've been several times in both the afternoon, evening and weekends. I've always had a pleasant experience with little noise disruption from others going to the movie. There is stadium seating and the seats are comfortable.   The bathrooms and theater have always been clean with no problems.   The theater can get crowded at night and weekends. Same goes with the parking lot.  If you drink lots of soda when going to the movies, buy the value cup and then each time you come back, the refill is only 1 dollar.

I cruised to the Burrito Co. to try the breakfast burrito. I will have to say, the breakfast burrito is superior than the meat/bean burrito.  The breakfast burritos are a nice size, fresh and tasty. I would like to see more meat. I ordered my burrito with sausage and probably received the about 2 links of sausage.  The price is right, about $3.50 for the burrito.

I'm basing my review on my one experience there with a Pastrami sandwich. The pastrami was very good. I enjoyed the sandwich, fries and pickle very much. The price was reasonable..   The service was average.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated, but we were also there during a peak time.  My wife and her friends go here quite a bit and they always enjoy the food, with no complaints.

I had no idea a winery existed in Scottsdale. I went to Su Vino this past weekend on a tasting during the Taste of Scottsdale tour.   During the tasting, I sampled a white, a red and a dessert wine. I like to have wine from time to time, but by no means a wine expert. I usually don't drink white wine, but the pour I had here was very nice and sweet. I liked the white wine quite a bit over the red (which I would normally drink). The red wasn't your normal red and something I've never had before. I wish I could recall the name. The dessert wine (Su Vino's most popular) was a nice treat to cap off the outing.    The wines are very young. Please remember that when tasting.   The tastings are also very affordable.   The person pouring the wine and providing all the information about the selections was very nice and informative. He shared information about the various wines, where the grapes came from and about the winery itself..   There is a limited food menu that is paired with the wine as a snack or light meal. Don't come here to have a regular meal.  A cool thing about this place is you can come here and make your own wine. Behind the bar are some empty bottles of wine they have made for events/celebrities.  I think this would be a fun place to do a tasting with parents, in laws or friends from out of town who like to enjoy wine or sample new wine.  I'd like to go back and sample some other wines and get another feel of this place when not on a "tour" outing.

A nice place to go to catch the blockbuster movie again or catch a movie you didn't feel like paying $10-11 during the first run. I've been here for a handful of movies and I've always had a pleasurable experience. The price is right, $3 per ticket for every show, any time. The price is $2 on Tuesdays.  I normally don't hit the concession stand, but there is a wide variety of snacks that seem to be a bit cheaper than other movie places.   The first time or two you go here, make sure to check out the items in the cases, walls etc. There is a bunch of cool pics, figures etc.  Is it just me or does Pollack look like the Lion in the Wizard of Oz?

How can you not like a store that basically meets all your needs in one area? This Target is nice, clean and has a friendly staff. I've always been able to find what I'm looking for at this store. The items are always in stock. Prices are always really good.   This Target is a bit further drive than the location on Baseline and McClintock, but is MUCH better overall  There is also a snack bar with a Starbucks inside.

I haven't shopped in Ross for years and years. Ross was never at the top of my list to shop. I usually preferred a competitor that started with a M. Maybe I may reconsider and give both locations an equal chance.  After eating close by, my wife and I stopped in to check out the new Ross location.  I needed some new shorts and thought I'd take a look.   Unlike other Ross stores, the store was pretty free of clothes on the floor being late in the evening. When the lines started to get a few deep, another register was opened. That was nice.   I was able to find some nice mens shorts for $13 and $15.   I can't speak for the womens apparel, but the mens side had lots of athletic wear, shorts, pants, jeans and shirts to choose from.  I was happy with all the selections.  I also found a really nice pet food container for $7  . I'm sure there will be a return trip to Ross at some point in the future.      .

I recently went back with my wife and a friend for dinner before a movie. The food was still good and the service was much better than what I experienced last time.   I think the burgers are well done and you get your choice of various sides (as many as you want). A few sides cost extra or if you want another slice of cheese. The fries or sweet potato fries are above average.  The waiter refilled our water and drinks and gave the check to us in a timely manner. This didn't happen during my previous experience.  My wife and I split an Oreo and Marshmallow  shake. The shake was superb! I think we both regretted splitting the shake instead of getting our own. For shake lovers, there is a huge variety of flavors and selections to choose from.  I've raised my rating to a 4 now with the service improvement.  I still need to take the 1 lb burger challenge.

When you think of a pub, you don't really envision the way the Rose and Crown is being in an old house. It works though!  I had my first visit to the Rose and Crown before a baseball game this past weekend and had a good time. .   There is a wide selection of beers both tap and bottle to choose from. You should be able to find your pub favorites as well as some other local flavors.  The staff was very friendly and attentive..  After my friend ordered the bangers and mash, I regretted already eating lunch. I was this close to ordering a plate even though I was full. The food looked that good.  The place isn't too big inside and was pretty crowded by the time I left.. There is space outside as well. I'm sure it's a cool place to have a drink when it's not 100 plus degrees outside.

Margaritaville is what it is, a place to have fun and have some drinks. If you take it for more than that, you'll be disappointed. When I've gone to any Margaritvaville, it's for some drinks and some appetizers.  Prior to the hockey game, my friends and I stopped in for a drink or two. We also ordered the big stack of nachos with all the toppings. The nachos were great and hit the spot.  We probably could have devoured another order.  I ordered a hurricane. The drink was good, but hardly as good as the hurricanes I've had in the past here. Service was very good.

Stopped by for some drinks at Loco Patron. The margaritas were great and brought to the table quickly.  Service was great. It was nice hanging with friends and having a drink during a wonderful February day out on the patio. I just wish the drinks were slightly cheaper.

I don't eat sushi. I stick with other menu items when I eat Japanese. The group of 8 I was with was not impressed by the sushi served at this place.  The sushi didn't seem to be as fresh or the fish as high of quality as other places.  This group eats sushi all the time. Among the lowlights was one person put a roll in her mouth only to come across a tooth pick that was meant to hold the roll in place (i'm assuming), but was broken somewhere along the way.  I wasn't impressed with what I had-some beef item and some sesame chicken. I should have just drank my beers and had the enaname and nothing else.  The one bright spot was the happy hour beer, drinks and the lower cost of the food items during happy hour. Everyone would have been really irked if we had to pay full price for the food since there was little to no enjoyment there.  Service was pretty slow and took awhile to get the check..   This place would be at the bottom if not the bottom of Japanese/sushi places in/around Tempe.

I went to Firehouse for the first time this past weekend. The place was clean and I enjoyed the decor.   The sandwiches were very good and fresh. The brisket and cheddar sandwich was really good. I also split the engine company sub with my fiancee and enjoyed the sandwich. The sandwiches were made within 5 minutes of the order.  I liked the crushed ice instead of the cube you typically get at most eating esablishments.   I didn't find the food too expensive. The cost for 2 sandwich combos was $16-17.  About what you would pay at Dilly's.  I expect I will hear "Welcome to Firehouse" in the future.

My wife and I have been taking our cats to University Animal Hospital for twp plus years now. We've taken the cats in for a variety of reasons-shots, blood sugar/weight check for our older cat (she needs insulin now for diabetes) and putting in a locator chip and shots for the kitten we bought in September 2008.  The staff is always friendly and helpful. Maybe I'm lucky, but I've always seen the same Doctor for our cats needs. The Doctors and other Vet staff are very professional and have tons of experience. The staff always explain what is wrong. preventative measures or helpful hints.  When waiting for the Doctor, I always learn some facts on the touch  screens in the room. I think that is a handy tool to pass the few minutes from when you enter the room until the Doctor arrives.  Animal care can be expensive! I don't know of many vet places that aren't! I'd rather pay for very good vet care for my animals then take the cheap way out and provide crappy care when they need it. There are some bad vets out there!    I trust University Animal Hospital with my cats well being and would take a dog when that day comes.

I finally had my long awaited treat from Cookiez on Mill. I was not disappointed. The homemade cookies were great and the ice cream was superb. Put them together and you have an awesome ice cream cookie sandwich. You can choose from several different cookie and ice cream combinations. The cookies are a pretty good size.   Don't have the guts to eat a regular ice cream sandwich? Well, you're in luck, you can get a 1/2 order, 1 cookie split in half with ice cream in between. Even this is a decent size serving for one person.  You can also get shakes, smoothies, italian ice/gelato here.   I was happy to also see bottled Coke (a personal favorite) in the fridge, among the bottled plastic sodas and water!  I saw a sign on the wall that there is fresh squeezed lemonade served.  I enjoy Cold Stone as much as the next person, but do yourself a favor and bypass Cold Stone and go next door to get a ice cream cookie sandwich here.   I just wish the place was bigger with some more seating inside/outside for the patrons! There is only one small table with four chairs inside.

Camelback Moving recently helped my wife and I with our recent move. The movers showed up during the window of  time I selected.  The movers did a great job and were very nice.   There was a stubborn desk that couldn't be moved from a room. One of the movers helped me break down the desk to load on the truck. Upon delivery, he helped put the desk back together. A very nice touch.   The cost of the moving services was very reasonable.  The communication process from start to end was very professional. I've had other experiences that pale in comparison to the customer service I received with Camelback.  When I move again (hopefully not for awhile), I will be contacting Camelback again to assist in my move!

I've eaten at Shane's twice. The first time was well over a year ago before a hockey game and then yesterday before another hockey game. I can't recall what type of sandwich I had the first outing, I just remember the sandwich being good (or I wouldn't have come back).  Being a big fan of chicken tenders/strips, I opted to get the Tuesday special-4 tenders, 1 side and a drink for $6. A really good deal!.   The tenders are awesome and not overly breaded and fried! Some of the best tenders I've had and I've had many. The fries were good, but had a bit too much salt for my liking.   The dining area isn't especially big, but I dig the charm of the place. Paper towels are used instead of napkins.  There are 3 tv's on the walls to watch games or ESPN. Beers are available here.  I need to head back and try the ribs. Only coming here before a hockey game, II'm a bit reluctant to eat ribs and head into Jobing.com arena with rib sauce on my shirt.  Good eats for a good price!  The men's room was a disaster when I walked in though.

It's hockey season again, which means time to eat at the Westgate mall and specifically Shanes!  I ordered the pork platter and sides. The plate came to me within a few minutes. There was a huge portion of pork. I usually have no trouble putting down food, but this was a bit of struggle.   I went with beans and mac and cheese. Both sides were good and warm.  The only disappointing part of the meal was the texas toast. The toast was subpar.  It tasted like a piece of regular toast. Nothing to it. That's not texas toast!  Overall, Shanes is still a place I will stop by when I hit a hockey game and indulge in some good BBQ or chicken tenders.

My coworkers have raved about this pizza place I finally went with then for lunch.   We were greeted promptly, asked for our drinks. Nice atmosphere with a taste of NYC.  The waiter came back and took our order. We all opted for the lunch special of pizza, salad and drink. The salads came back a few minutes later and was a good size with a nice vinegarette.   About 10 minutes later, the pizza arrived. I really enjoyed my pizza. I ate my personal pizza quickly. I wish I had more.sausage on my pizza. That would be my only complaint that each slice had maybe 1 or 2 bits of sausage.   Service was very good. We were in/out within 45 minutes.  This will be a place I will head to for lunch often! Great pizza at a great price.

My wife has been trying to get me to head to Wildflower for some time. She says she could eat here almost every day. Both of us finally went here for lunch.  I've been brought into the Wildflower inner circle.  I was impressed by my Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich. The sandwich tasted great. This is the best roast beef sandwich I've had. The roast beef was very tender and had no fat and paired perfectly with the gorgonzola cheese.. The sourdough bread was very tasty and not hard. The veggies on the sandwich were very fresh and crispy.  As a side, I received a pasta salad. I typically don't like pasta salad, but this was very good. I just wish there was more of it. The side consisted of about 2 forkfuls of pasta.   Even though we went around peak lunch hour, our food was brought to us within 5 minutes of our order.  A sandwich and side is just under $7.  I was very pleased with my lunch. I'll head back and try some other items in the near future.

My wife and I went to the Mission to celebrate our first anniversary over brunch. We weren't disappointed. The food was great!   I had the Chilaquiles (corn tortillas, pork, egg, cojita) and have never quite tasted anything like it. A combination of flavors with a little bit of spice. The plate had a very nice portion as well. Good value for $9.  My wife had the corn pancakes with crab and loved the meal.  I made an executive decision to also order the homemade granola, yougurt and tropical fruit. This dish was superb. I was a bit disappointed that the menu listed the fruit options as pineapple, mango and papaya and when the plate arrived there were blueberries instead of the papaya. Mix in the fruit, yogurt and granola and we had a nice complement to our main meal.  The service was good. We had to wait awhile for our food. A table next to us ordered well after me, and ended up getting their food at least 10 minutes before. That was upsetting, because we were both very hungry! At least the waitress came over and said the food was on its way and thanked us for our patience.  The inside is very nice and has a cool decor.   There is a small patio outside and a full bar inside.  4.5 stars

Before hitting a movie at Tempe Marketplace, I finally caved in and ate at Paradise.. My previous experiences were just cookies at various locations.   I decided to go with the Paradise club (ham, turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato) served on a croissant. The meal was good and I left satisfied (not easy to do). Each sandwich comes with a cookie for $6.95. You can order a combo meal (drink/chips) for $1.99 more.  Not in the mood for a sandwich, there are wraps, salads, soups, panini's to choose.   While I enjoyed my sandwich and will eat here again, I still feel that Dilly's and Wildflower's sandwiches are better.  The cookies are amazing, especially the chocolate chip-5 stars for the cookies!

My family and I going to Qdoba. The staff is friendly and most importantly, my daughter loves the rice, chicken, cheese and peppers in her burrito bowl.  The food is always fresh and like the ability to pick and choose what fixings and toppings you can place on your taco or burrito.  I know this may scorn some, buy I'll take Qdoba over Chipotle anyday!  The place is always clean and usually served quickly.  The chips with guac is a tasty addition to any meal.  We try and hit Qdoba once every few weeks and never disappoints!.

Moe's is very average food. There isn't anything that stands out and falls behind similar places-Qdoba, Chipotle etc.   The food was fresh and tasted alright, but was nothing special. The burritos are on the smaller end and has smaller portions inside the burrito.  My biggest problem was the value. There is NO way a burrito of that size with that little rice, beans, meat should cost over $7.50 for an original size. I've had bigger and better burritos that cost around $5. A small soda for $2.50 is also a bit much (free refills).  With each order you do get chips and salsa. I really liked the chips. Salsa was okay.  One other thing that baffled me. My wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. You get this in a white box. When you try to throw it away, you can't fit the box in the trash can as the top is configured in a weird way. Good thinking.....  I was amused by the name of the Burritos-Homewrecker, Art Vandelay etc. Good stuff!  Moe's won't be high on list to go back to around Jobing.com for me. There are other places that are better.  2.5

The Gelato Maker has fantastic Gelato! This is the best gelato I've had since being in Europe last year.  The owner was super nice and allowed my wife and I to sample many flavors before deciding what to get. You have around 20 options to choose from, many fruits and then vanilla, chocolate, reeses cup among others.   My wife and I ended up getting a medium size each with two flavors. She went with pineapple and strawberry and I went with mango and stracciatella. All the flavors were great. The cost was $10.50 total.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the flavors, but I have a preference for the fruit. Can't wait to head back and go with some other fruit flavors (bloody orange, raspberry, lemon)     The shop is very clean and you can actually see the gelato being made in the back with real fruit.  A definite winner! Once you go here, all other gelato places will be inferior! I wish there was a location closer to Tempe.  Make sure to get a punch card for free gelato after several purchases!

Yogurtland has the best frozen yogurt around  the Tempe area in my opinion. Each time I've gone (at different times) the place is always busy. Usually with college kids. My trip last night saw a continuous stream of people for the duration of my time in line, to payment to sitting down and enjoying my treat. This place is doing quite well.  This place stands out from the other yogurt places because of the flavors and toppings. Most places only have six flavors, but Yogurtland has about 15.  The topping selection is extensive with numerous fruit toppings, then all the cookie, candy selections.   My personal favorite selections are the cookies and cream and chocolate. I liked strawberry, but for some reason the flavor doesn't seem as good anymore after having it last night. I sampled my wife's red velvet cake last night and now know what flavor I'm getting next time. Try it!

I typically head to Pro's Ranch Market (PRM) a few times a month. The place is huge. There are several speciality departments (bakery, tortillas, fish, meat etc). PRM has great prices throughout the store. I typically go there for the produce. I have noticed that you need to eat/use your produce within a few days or the items may go bad. Produce doesn't have quite the shelf life that you may get at Frys, Safeway etc because the fruits especially need a little more time to ripen up.  Each time I go to pick up food items, I have to make sure to hit the taqueria. I'ver never been disappointed with a meal there.  The al pastor is excellent. Getting a fruit drink or a bottled coke is a must. There are several options to go with for the fruit flavored drink.  When Ranch Market first opened up at this location, they provided free chips and guac at the salsa bar. Sadly, this is no longer happening. The salsa bar is still there, minus the chips and guac. I enjoyed topping of my tacos with the guac and having a few chips to go with my meal.  The homemade tortillas are awesome!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Always have several checkout lanes open. You shouldn't have to wait in line for more than a few minutes or behind 2-3 other customers.  The market, taqeria and parking lot can get very crowded.

MMMMMMMMMMMM Good! The fried chicken here is fantastic.The chicken was thoroughly cooked (doesn't happen every place).  My chicken bread was moist and juicy and some of  the best fried chicken I've ever had. The breading was not too greasy and tasted very good. After i finished my piece, I wanted more!  The waffle served with the chicken is very good! A very nice size and complemented the chicken well. I could do without the the slab of butter, a 1/4 of the butter would do.  The mac and cheese as a side is a definite winner!   I'm a big fan of the drinks coming in a mason jar.  Service was good.  I think the cost of the food is slightly overpriced. The 1 chicken breast and waffle was $8. A side of mac and cheese was $3.50.  One side item should come with every meal.   Based on how much I enjoyed the chicken and mac and cheese, I'll be back.

I've hit the express a few times to dine in and had my first carryout experience recently.  The express location is a great idea. The menu is a little more limited than the locations in Glendale and downtown Tempe.   You receive a sizable amount of food with your entree order. I have yet to be able to finish off the gyro platter in one sitting. That's saying something. You get a sizable amount of gyro meat, fresh veggies, rice and potatoes.You receive good value for your money for the amount of food you receive here. You won't go away hungry after an entree order.  The staff is nice and friendly. During my carryout order, my order was ready as stated. I arrived and the bartender was placing my items in the to go bag. There is nothing worse than having your food sit and sit or not be ready as expected.  There is outdoor seating and plenty of space inside to eat either in the main dining area or in the bar sitting. There are TV's to watch the game as well.

I finally had a chance to head back to Francis and Sons to get my truck washed (much later than I expected). My experience was better than my first go around. The initial outing was ok.  My truck didn't have the dirt residue on the back bumper, minimal water spots ( I'm ok with some) and the greeter didn't continually try to up sell me the other wash packages.  I found out that a SUV or truck results in your wash being $1-2 more. Either this is new or the last time I wasn't charged.  Cars are still $6.99  My truck was washed, dried and vacuumed within 15 minutes.  There is also a frequent wash card that is now available. Your 10th wash is free. That's a nice little perk.

Lobbys first grabbed my eye when dropping off a Blockbuster movie. The location had been vacant for some time after Extreme Pita left. I was excited to hear this was a burger place.   I finally gave the place a try tonight and wasn't disappointed. I had the double burger with cheese. All burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onion, large pickles slices and homemade sauce on a sesame bun.  The meat is high quality (not frozen), seasoned  and cooked to perfection. Topped with cheese and you have a real delight. After I ate my burger, I wish I had more!   I'm a big fan of the crinkle cut french fries. I haven't had those in a LONG time. I found the fries a bit too salty. I like salt on my fries, but this was a tad much. You receive a very large portion of fries (perfect for me). You could probably even split the fries with another person if you wanted.   You can make any meal a combo meal (fries/drink) for $2.79 more.  The price of the burgers and hots dogs are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting.  Based on the size you order, you're looking  at $4-6.50 w/o cheese.  I do wish there was more than just 1 size of drink and not in a styrofoam container. I could go for something a little smaller than a super big gulf size-32 oz.  I hope this place does well as they make great food. This isn't an ideal location unless you know about the place, but I think Lobbys can do well with some more publicity and word of mouth.  The reviews on Yelp are a good start.  If you like burgers as much as I do, give this place a shot!   4.5 stars!

Headed back to Lobby's. How I missed this tasty burger. I wasn't disappointed with round 2. The burger was still fantastic! I'm also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip.   With any burger purchase, getting the combo pack (fries/soda) is the smart choice.  I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.  Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down. The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun. That's a good thing in my opinion!

The Hillside is close to my home and makes a nice walk with the family to go there for lunch/brunch. The food there is really good and I believe almost all food  is gathered from local growers.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo, eggs, cheese and potatoes. The burrito was flavorful and very good. There is also a small side of fruit served with the meal. I wish the fruit was a bit bigger.  I had a bite of my wife's torta sandwich and that was really good. That might be an option next time.  There is a nice patio outside with a fireplace as well as ample seating inside.  Service was great and food came out quickly! We'll be bake there over and over sampling other items.  Nice atmsophere that is also kid friendly.

I tried Yum Yum right before a movie at Tempe Marketplace.  I ordered a combo plate with chow mien, orange chicken, beef broccoli and BBQ pork. You can get several types of combo platters with either chow mien, rice or fried rice.  The chow mein had almost no flavor. Probably the worst chow mien I can recall having in some time or ever.  The Beef Broccoli was good and flavorful, but not means exceptional. I wish there was a bit more beef.  The BBQ tasted pretty good, but had quite a bit of fat/gristle on my pieces. Not a fan of that. I had to nibble around the fat pieces.   The orange chicken was superb! I would go back for this item.  Compared to other buffet, fast food Chinese places, Yum Yum falls short in the number of menu items and quality of their food.    The dining area is pretty big and has a TV. Drinks are from the fountain.  Overall, some menu items were good, but others were sub-par.  2.5

I met up with friends to watch the Sharks/Coyotes recently. The hotel is just a sort walk to the arena and the Westgate Center. A smart choice if you plan on hanging out before and after the game and don't want to drive home or just want a few nights away.  The hotel was clean and had a nice lobby to work, relax and in the morning to have breakfast.  The breakfast was more than the usual continental breakfast at most hotels. There was coffee, juice, fruit, sausage, omlettes and potatoes. You can also make your own waffles.  The room was big, clean and smelled fresh. Lots of tv channels to choose from.    There is a swimming pool on site to cool off when it's hote.  I would definitely stay here again for a weekend hockey game with friends.

I enjoy gyros quite a bit and after not having one for awhile I thought that would make a good choice for dinner tonight.   The gyro has a healthy portion of meat with some tomatoes (onions were held) on fresh pita served with a side of tzatziki. I wish I had more tzatziki given the amount of meat I had.  The gyro was $4.95. I've probably had gyros in the past cost at least a dollar or two more with half the meat.  Planning to go back and trying some kabobs or I may just settle for another gyro.  The menu has many options with the mediterranean flair and has items strictly for vegetarians.  Very casual atmosphere inside. .  The soda fountain serves Pepsi products.

Before hitting the Coyotes game, the group wanted to get something sweet. We stopped by. Ocean Blue has below average frozen yogurt. The worst I've had anywhere!   I was very disappointed with this place. The yogurt didn't taste that good and was a bit icy. Not a good combination.  .I sampled several flavors. I sampled Black Cherry, Milk Chocolate, Cardinals Crush and Cookies and Cream. Black Cherry and Cookies and Cream lacked flavor. Cardinals Crush tasted like medicine you had as a child. The chocolate tasted the best and got a very small portion to satisfy my sweet tooth. If you mess up chocolate, you have a real problem.   There is a decent selection of toppings to choose from. Not the most I've seen, but more than other places.  Next time, I'll pass on Ocean Blue.  Unless you want subpar yogurt, you should as well.

This location is super quick! I placed the order and about the time I was putting my change back in my wallet the 2 sandwiches were ready! WOW. I've never received a sandwich quicker.  The sandwiches are packed with meat and have fresh toppings. The bread is also good, nice and soft and not soggy.

The name just about says it. The place should be kept a secret to avoid a big mistake by going there and wasting your money.  A groupon came available and my wife and I jumped on it since we enjoy Mexican and we see this place every time we head to the store further down Chandler.   Since we had a groupon, we had to make a reservation. We arrived and still had to wait about 10 minutes to get seat. Not a good start. We were greeted, informed the server we had the groupon and told we can't use the groupon for the taco special. We didn't plan on it since we rather have entrees, but noted.  We ordered the chips and guacamole and were pleased with the dish. Very good!  I ordered the combination plate, 2 enchiladas, rice beans and a taco.  My wife had the fish taco plate. When my food arrived, my enchiladas were dry, bland and the worst enchiladas I've had in my lifetime.They were awful and couldn't envision anybody liking them. Enchiladas should be flowing with sauce and meat and cheese. These enchiladas were anything buy. The beans tasted they came out of a can. Hard and not flavorful Rice was okay. The taco was the best thing on the plate and that was really average at best.    I wasn't looking for much, just good mexican food! You won't find that here!  My wife's order came with just the tacos. No rice no beans. Took many minutes to correct the problem.  I was able to get a refill early, but my wife never got her water refilled. She was never asked checked after the food arrived. We tried to flag down our server with no luck.   The check took a long time to get to us. Overall, the service was poor. The server may have been new, but even the basic servers tasks weren't done well.  A general observation was the owner/manager was going around and talking with others that he seemed to know. Take a second and stop by a new person/table and get real feedback. I would have had a few helpful suggestions.  With all the issues around this place, food and service, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  There are many places in the area that serve better food!

I'm a big fan of 5 guys and was excited when a location was opening up near my home.  I'm glad 5 guys has been making their way out west and in the Phoenix area, first in Mesa and Tempe and now in South Phoenix.. I was familiar with them during my trips back to the DC area and always had to \have one when I was there..  Things I enjoy about 5 guys, the simple menu choices, the topping choices, the free peanuts while you wait for your food and the meat is fresh.  You get a very tasty and high quality burger with the toppings you like.   You also get a ton of fries, even on the small order. A small fry should feed a two people no problem  If you order a cheeseburger, fries and a soda, you are looking at about $11.  This location is always packed! I've been here 3 times since the placed opened at various times and days of the week and there is always a ton of people here. Even with the location, crowded, your food is ready in about 10 minutes.  I just wish the price was a bit cheaper, but worth a treat every so often.

My first experience going here wasn't positive. I was shopping and came lunch time and heard about the taco shop. I decided to give a shot. I was looking at the menu and when I finally ordered, the employee said, there was no al pastor ready. That seemed odd since it was about 11:30 am and one of the signature items. Does McDonalds run out of cheeseburgers?  He could have told me when I was waiting there that they were out of a menu item. . Unhappy, I went somewhere else to eat.  My next venture was more successful (just recently). I ordered 3 al pastor tacos. The tacos came out fresh and flavorful. There was a bit of a wait, probably 7-10 minutes to get my tacos which was a bit disappointing.  I also enjoyed the crushed ice that the fountain drinks are served with, much better than cubes. The only problem I was very thirsty and drank most of the soda while waiting for the tacos. Refills are extra, bummer.  I would head back just for the el pastor tacos as that is something that is not easily found and when you do find it, not always good.

I wish I knew about this place before just last week. After dinner at the Herb Spot, we went upstairs to the lounge. I had no idea what i was getting into.  The evening I went, the crowd was much older.  There was a band playing with the smooth sounds of George Hamilton busting out some Motown and R&B hits and sounded really good.  There is a nice outdoor area.  I'd much rather head to this place to hang out for drinks then some of the trendier places around the area.  Drinks are reasonable and received my drinks pretty quickly.

My 5 guys experience was always on the East Coast (Maryland). I was excited that a location was coming just a few miles from me. I really enjoy the burgers and fries. I've held off long enough, but the time had finally to come to enjoy the 5 guys burger once again.  I'm very shocked with all the sour reviews low scores. I think folks in AZ and out west are still getting to know 5 guys and haven't fully appreciated the goodness.   Locally, I would only take a Lobby's burger over 5 guys. In/Out is close. Each their own.....  5 guys is still a great burger. I will admit the burger was a bit below the taste that I had in Maryland. I think it may have been the bun.  The fries tasted just the same, which I really enjoy. The fries are cut there and fresh. A regular fries can easily feed 2 people. Don't go for the larger size, you'll regret the cost and having so many extra fries.  I enjoy the simple menu and you get to decide what toppings you want on your burger. There are several options to choose from.    The free peanuts is a nice touch to snack on before your meal is ready..I always enjoy a handful.  With this location, the biggest issues were the floors were dirty and the music being played was VERY loud. I'm at a place to eat, not a rock show or club.  My wife was super excited there was caffeine free diet coke in the fountain.

Recently we had a few make up lessons at Aqua Tots on Friday Evenings. After the swim lesson, we've stopped by to get some Gelato. We've been there 4 times now.  My daughter loves the strawberry and eat the whole cup. She's 2.5. I also enjoy the flavor.  There are many standard fruit flavors and chocolate varities and some unique flavors. I personally like Death by Chocolate and any of the fruit flavors with the exception of the blackberry merlot.  Staff is friendly and always willing to allow multiple tasters  A nice treat to end the day. I just wish they had a location closer to where I live.  The location could be better because if you didn't see the van towards the street or knew this shop was there you'd have no idea unless they hope to just get traffic going to the other shopping/restaurants/school.
