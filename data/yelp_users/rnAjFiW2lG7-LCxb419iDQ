I'm having such a hard time reviewing this place...I normally have a pretty good experience and the food is usually pretty good, but this last time, I had bad food and bad service.  I had the italian sausage pasta which is normally salty so I asked for less salt.  I was sharing it with someone who can't eat peppers so I asked for it on the side.  My dish was flavored right but the peppers weren't on the side.  My roommate ordered the spaghetti and meatball special but with less sauce.  The spaghetti was smothered in sauce, when we asked about it, the waitress quickly said there's normally even more sauce...hard to believe.  The pasta was way over done too.  The one constant is the bread...they have really good bread...very unique in comparison to the bread at other italian restaurants.  It was a less than superb outing this time.  I'll eventually go back to try it again but I don't know if I can justify the drive if the experience is bad again.

Pros - great carne asada meat, cheap prices, they provide marinade, ready to grill in 45 mins, good fresh salsa for sale  Cons - tiny hole in the wall store that's almost convenience store like  I'm looking forward to going back the next time I have cravings for carne asada.

Pros - great happy hour, great food, great drinks, great service.  Their dishes are made in a way where you can swap out ingredients if you prefer something else.  Also, you can call ahead if you know what wine you like and they'll decanter it for you.  Cons - regular dining can get expensive (non-happy hour)  I love this restaurant and it's happy hour.  I take all my out of town guests here.  The decor is nice, the service is great, and the bar offers a fun atmosphere.  I even recommended a few people do Valentines here.    They used to offer a great escargot appetizer as well a great clam appetizer with an amazing sauce.  I know they try to keep things fresh by changing up the menu, but hopefully they'll switch back soon.  The new curryish clam appetizer isn't cutting it for me.  Mothership beer is good and I've always loved the petite-syrah there.

Pros - friendly service, great food, great location, great view of Las Vegas Blvd  Cons - none (can you believe it?  NONE!)  I really don't have anything bad to say about this place!  It's amazing.  I've eaten here multiple times and it never fails to impress.  Funny thing, I've only eaten here for brunch and never for dinner.  My all time favorite is the eggs benedict.  Ask for smoked salmon instead of the Canadian bacon.  They'll happily replace it for you.  The english muffin is fluffy and delicious.  The hash browns is a nice touch.  The LGO is great as well...healthy and delicious!  To be honest, I'm worried that my best kept secret will become popular knowledge resulting in over popularization and a decline in quality and service.  Do me a favor...don't go here!

Pros - Unique dining concept, Owner/Chef/Waiter/Busboy Christopher is very fun and engaging, great small restaurant ambiance (3-4 small tables indoors, large outdoor dining), BYOB, and creative food experience.  Cons - Your meal is influenced by other people's food preferences.  I took a large group of out of town visitors to Cafe Monarch because I read such great reviews on Yelp.  Reservations are key to dining here.  When you make your reservation, you need to provide Christopher with your food preferences and he whips up a meal for your group based on what you tell him you can't eat.  It's definitely not a place for picky eaters.  The meal he created was good and made me want to come back to see what he'd make the next time.  Be forewarned, this was a 2-3 hour dining experience so don't expect to dine and dash.

Pros - the iced coffee is really good, the service is very friendly, they offer the syrup sweetener which is key for iced drinks, you can purchase decent bottles of wine to consume as well  Cons - none  It might have been the beautiful days or the company I was with, but the 3-4 times I've been here, I left a happy camper.  My GF and I have made this place our regular coffee spot when we have time on the weekends to unwind.  The last few times the weather has been so amazing that we even took advantage of the outdoor seating.

The Toddy Iced Coffee was weak and flavorless this last time!  What the heck?  I was raving about the coffee here to some out of town guests and I took them there only to have weak flavorless coffee.  =[

Pros - fried chicken, spicy collard greens, buttered corn, Kool-aid, and very friendly service.  Cons - dry chicken breast (it was my attempt at being healthy...I should have known better), and waffles weren't up to my expectations.  It took me 8 years to go to Lo-Lo's.  The chicken was delicious.  The next time I go, I'm going to order chicken wings, collard greens, cornbread, and Kool-aid.  Skip the waffles and any attempt at being healthy.

Pros - all you can eat peanuts, large portions  Cons - bad for people who are allergic to peanuts because the shells are everywhere, most expensive burger meal I've had in awhile at $12 (cheeseburger, cajun fries, and soft drink), slower than other burger joints, no drive through  The portion was big...I ended up throwing away most of my fries.  I prefer Fatburger over Five Guys.
