Italian hero was decent but probably wouldn't come back for it.  The pasta salad was old and some of the pasta was starting to get hard.  No bueno.  Overall I'd say they are coming up short in too many levels. If you want a real Italian deli go to Niccolis not too far from here.  They have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!

My favorite fast food restaurant of all time.  Fast, healthy, consistent, quality!  I have been going there for like 25 years.  It's the bomb.

$8 for popcorn.  That is not right.  Seriously I can't order a smaller size.  I would rather go to a regular theater and not be bothered by the inattentive server, the people eating noisily with fork and knife around me, and the light that is so bright next to my side that it is distracting.  Blah!!  I think I am most upset about the popcorn.  The food is average  and over priced and the whole serving people with in a movie is really not a great idea.    I like many other Americans appreciate value and good deals.  The amc esplanade offers neither when it comes to food at least.  If you are going to pay $9 for some potato skins at least make them really good.   They were actually ok but the whole experience leaves a sour taste.

The best dispensary in phoenix that I have been to thus far.  Good prices.  Excellent customer service.  Taste buds edibles.  Lots of specials.  Happy hour (maybe no longer doing however).  Always giving back to their customers.   Great quality herb.  Pre-packaged and air sealed.  Thumbs up!!

Simply the best tacos I've ever had.  Amazing food all around and a world class tequila selection to boot.  Can't say enough good things about this place.

Ginger is such a professional.  She gives great hair advice and the cuts are always on point.  Much love to G. You won't be disappointed.  :-)
