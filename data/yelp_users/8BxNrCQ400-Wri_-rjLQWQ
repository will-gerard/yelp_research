I love this place!!!!!  I couldnt find it and kept calling the store for directions they were very kind and polite.  I told the lady that helped me so much I was really surprised by how friendly she was.  All the workers are volunteers!! Non profit company that is really organized and has such a collection of yarn to choose from.   This will be my place to shop for special projects and any projects of mine versus going to michaels or even walmart for yarn.  Much higher quality!  Will definitely be coming to this place more often.

Brittany is an amazing bartender. Has the Dutch pancake if your getting berries expect more of a pastry. The sausage option will odder for of a better natural pancake.   Bloody Mary is always amazing  I love that they give you a beer chaser.

Great food!  Good service if you have the older asian woman (very petite) I like the drinks but wish the didnt have so much foam on the top.  I'm paying 5 dollars for 2 dollars of liquid. Whenever I am seated I always move because they always start placing people nearest to the door and I personally dont like being seated there! I always just move a little bit to be a bit more private with my boyfriend.   The food is always good when I go!

I'm not one to be knowledgable of nutrition so when I went here with my bf who was looking to get more nutrients for his muscles since he does landscaping. We realized after talking with Zac that he should be in taking at least 5-7,000 calories.   ZAC WAS AWESOME!!!!!! Really knew his stuff about muscle nutrition so much I wanted to get some.   We ended up leaving with a more generic brand of protein powder that he suggested but definitely got the amino acids supplement he pointed out to us.   It's been about a week of taking the supplements and I can already feel myself a bit stronger and not exhausted at the end of a work shift.   Thanks so much!!!

I love Panda! Its always been a favorite of mine.  The service is always quick, easy and out the door. Kinda curious why there arent many asians working there anymore? I remember when I would go to panda and really  think it was a chinese or asian place.

This was my first time being here and the service was quick yet after I ate my shredded beef burrito with cheese, rice and beans.  I loved the tortillas, I swear they have the best ever!!!!!   However I ended up enjoying my burrito for only about an hour then my body was not pleased with it and i puked it all up.

It's a dirty rental garage but upstairs is nice. Great artworks of arizona are represented. Do your yelp research when renting a car and pack food because you don't want to have to spend an arm and a leg on figuring overpriced food.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!  it has an outstanding view of the southern phoenix area and if you go right before sunset you see the beautiful Arizona skies.  definitely double up on the indian fry bread- to die for!!!!!!   if youre with a big party I would suggest getting the dinner platter it offers TONS of food and actually sits on a tray right next to your table.  very convienent for table space since theyre isn't much at some places to sit  did I mention theres a slide to get to the bottom level, if youre not feeling adventurous you can always take the stairs :)

I have been coming here for years. My late father had a lot of work done by Bob Sims. RIP thankfully Karen was there to save my side tattoo. Originally I had went to Epic Tattoo and had Aaron starting this piece. As time went on he kept asking for more money and it was sitting ridiculous. Making fun of the people who come with you and your tattoo. He's just rude.  I went to lucky draw for Karen to completely re work and rectify my amazing piece. Seriously she is the greatest this color hasn't faded and is a constant conversation starter when im out swimming.  I've been needing to get more work done but I also want more tats. Corey is also a phenomenal piercer. This man has seen every inch of me and pierced the most sensitive spot on my body and was completely professional considering where his hand was located on me.  He is great!!!

This sylist literally thought rubbing my hair on my crown in a ball was creating volume such as a tease.  I looked at him and told him that he should just throw his license away because he was doing nothing but crating a rat's nest in my hair.  Further more I cannot trust anyone to cut my hair - the last time was over a year ago here.  He cut my hair into a slight mohawk which I did not want.    After this event I have decided to cut my hair myself and I have gotten more compliments on it then I ever got when I went here or even ulta.

I am a previous employee so word of advice!!!! If its busy af and you see a line  of 50 people, GO TO THE MACHINE AKA KIOSK!!!!!!!  its faster and will get you on the way quicker so you can stop complaining about waiting in line.  if you are youre just ignorant and don't want to use technology.   Hertz is also probably the only rental car company that has a long ass line because everyone that goes through hotwire, priceline etc that is a prepaid voucher 90% of the time is done through hertz.  also if you prepaid through any 3rd party company you most likely wont get your money back....read terms and conditions people!!!!! If they say they are out of cars they most likely are....if they offer you an upgrade its because you were not reserved in that vehicle so you WILL have to pay more IF you DONT want to WAIT. STOP COMPLAINING THAT THE RRC IS "FAR" FROM THE AIRPORT,  rental car companies used to be in the airport in the 90's however moved due to overcrowding and safety, so you tourist can just shut yo mouth and ride the damn bus.   and AGAIN IF YOU DONT WANT TO WAIT GO TO THE KIOSK ITS 24/7

Always go with the daily special here. The magnet and team are great!! Always get great service! Even today the manager upgraded out drink size "because we were so great." I really enjoy management treating their customers.  Their need is fresh and soft, meat tastes and is deli fresh. When in have a sun from here I can taste and see the difference between goodcents and subway. More meat. More veggies and less bread.

The margaritas will make any persopn feel like a sailor half way through their small cup. their ratio for the mix is 50/50, it tastes very strong but well worth your dollar i love the fish taco, I usually get a la cart and substitute things in, I can be a picky eater and the service is always helpful and comforting to know that its ok that I want certain things the way I like. Chimichangas are very good I always get shreeded beef chimis, with green sauce on top(let in soak in with the heat). its GOOOOOD Tables and eating area is a bit more open then I had anticipated at first but then again half way into my margarita im not thinking about seating anymore,  one con: they dont olay anything in the background no music or anything so if no one is in the restaurant with you it can be a bit erie and creepy with how quiet it can be

I wish I could give no stars for this shitty place!!!! Let's me first start this review off by saying the employees who are working the front part of the office will never help you. They give the poorest attitude, and have the fakest smiles and little effort to service their residents. Don't even bother calling and talking with the front office just email the manager Desiree mueller directly, I also make it clear that I do not want to speak to the front office staff.   Now during the 7 months I have lived here I have realized if you like living with scorpions, cockroaches, gnats, and dog shit everywhere then go ahead and move in.   I don't understand  why the south complex have doggie bags containers and the north side has none. People on north side don't pick up their dogs crap and maintenance will simply push it to the side.   The office tends to take matters to extremes, an incident that happened and I quote Cathryn "residents were discarding personal affects, such as toiletries for their animals." My thought is um where do you expect them to toss their fecal matter? she then said that "residents are to dispose of personal affects in the dumpster." which is inconveniently located far away from any grass. So it's confusing why the office would then decide to flip the stone trash can over on the grass right in front of my balcony. I called to complain and I was told by Cathryn that it would be handled in a timely manner. Such as 3 weeks long. After they removed it there was a HUGE brown spot.   Also I was never aware of the fact that when your AC isn't working I called to let the office know. A few days later I come home from work to find a crew halfway in my ceiling, ladders, my cats are scared beyond belief. I had to ask where they were because I couldn't find one. Also the door was left open. I asked them why they were here and their reply was "oh the office didn't tell you we are here to replace some lines" no one told me anything so that caught me by surprise. They also had to come back a couple days later because they didn't do it right.   Just save your money. I wish I would have.

I went here with my boyfriend to look for a car. We were interested in a lancer we saw online. While we looked around I got the impression our sales person did not know what she was doing or something.  Once we found the lancer we went for a drive. I asked her questions and Veda did not know anything about the car or had updated herself on the Carfax. When I asked her question regarding the vehicle I was told that its in the Carfax on the floor. All she kept saying was "oh you look good in this" or "you like it huh" I ended up working out a deal with the higher boss by trading in my over heating terrible Honda civic. I swear I was losing money in that thing. I'm surprised he gave me 1300 for it.  Unfortunately before I left I looked over the car checked for things. First I could not open the gas cap. It was missing a clip?!! So I had to go back the next day to get it fixed.  A few days later my battery is completely dead. My boyfriend has been reading the owners manual, that if stored for long periods of time the battery will die out. I then called that night and spoke with George B, a manager. He informed that he would replace the battery and take care of me.  I came the next day. It was originally my day off but I got called in and had to leave for work right after the dealership. Stress is not a word big enough.  Larry the Mitsubishi Stevie manager I'm guessing. Tell me that if it was an original battery the. It would need to be replaced. My first question is why was it last services at 37k miles and I purchased at 38k miles. Next question if the battery does is there another issue I'm not aware of. I then start to complain about why I even bought the car because my prior vehicle had issues with it. Larry tells me that nothing else is wrong with the vehicle and that it doesn't need a service for a while. He tells me he will have me out of here in an hour and a half. Then when I tell him I needed to be out of here he tells me he just has to write it up and then ill e out of here which was true they did finish. But it's the inconvenience that was a frustration.   2 stars for the fact that I got my car before it went to auction. I love my car so that's why they got stars.

I come here for the coveinence not the service.  Management is terrible.  I had ordered two hot spicy and a club with dollar fry. Not hard. I pull through the dive through received a bag of I don't even know what I got.  I Nask to speak to the manager, she doesnt come over at all..too busy working to come over as explained by the larger girl working behind the counter perhaps it is the area but I dont see any enthusiaum when i go here.. only because it is two steps down the street

Ive been coming to this place since 1995, sure places change a little but whenever I go I always get a shredded beef chimchunga, even though they took it off the menu they still make it, all you have to do is ask :)  ducks are friendly and sometimes you see turtles in the pond which is really cool for kids.  sitting inside by the large windows is very interesting especially if its sunny the water just glistens into the windows while youre eating.  They do have a nice waiting area outside with a fire pit they sometimes light if its hilly out during the winter or nighttime.    Drinks are hard which I like, I hate going some place, paying for a drink and getting some watered down thing they call a margarita......  Like I said ive been coming here for over 20 years, even when they were remodeling the car inside...this place never disappoints me.   there is misters outside during the summer with added shading to keep the sun off you and there are heaters during the evenings.  great accomodations especially when y late father who was quadriplegic would come they would always be courteous to him and never bat an eyelash when he asked for his food to be put on his plate because it was specific for him to be able to eat..  love this place  fingers crossed I can eventually bring my kids here!!!! :))

I'm always looking for the best frys and being downtown it can really limit the places to shop for groceries when youre on a budget.  It has a much better selection of food and organics than other frys, though their pita breads could have more of a selection than the off brand ones.  I throughly like this store

The food which were the pulled pork sliders were amazing!!!!  buns were a bit too greasy for my personal taste and very filling...had to take home more than half the meal. but the reason I gave suh a poor star rating was due to their own brewed beers.  I order the sampler of their beers and I have to be honest it all tasted like dog piss. especially the light beers I could not even get past one sip.  I set it back and the waiter was like well I still have to charge you for it.  im just sitting there thinking ummm even after I said I hated them all only after a sip.    not too sure if ill stop by again or even mention this place to anyone

Service.  Was great until checkout..... Matthew, a twenty something with brown hair, was fine during the first few minutes of bagging but he asked me if I wanted my pizzas in a bag. I assumed it would be put in one bag per pizza. They were digorno pizzas with the bred sticks or wings. Matthew told us that they wouldn't fit in a bag. So my boyfriend said it was fine without a bag, but I knew they could fit one in a bag per box. So I asked for a large paper bag. Matthew held up the box to the bag And told me it wouldn't work. I just stood there and continued to place groceries on the line. When I noticed he put one in a bag and the inter in another plastic bag. THEN... Things were getting hostile between the cashier brittani and him. They kept discussing work related topics sucks as the time of the checkout. The cashier seemed irritated with the day that the bagging area was over crowded and backed up. Seemed like she wanted to say something. After that i noticed he was doing s terrible job bagging which caused bags to rip. putting a wide variety of packages in one bag  Matthews attitude changed as well giving a sarcastic goodbye.   Store Clean but carts were hard to find when store is busy.   Overall I like that I have a marketplace close to me but that was some surprising service at the end of my trip. I'll be back but hopefully I will be able to have a better bagger

I can't tell you how wonderful they are only my experience   My cat Marley came in got his first round of shots. Everyone loved him so much. Came back got him fixed and another round of shots.   Now this is where they stand out apart from other vets  It's not the price it's how your animal is treated and loved   Marley got out for less that 8 hours I found him on the brink of death. Since their not a hospital I took him to emergency over on Glendale and 23ave. After I got Marley ok ish. I called dreamy draw they got his discharge info from the hospital and are coordinating a surgery date with a surgeon they recommend. Not only did they give me mind you I paid but they gave me pain meds for him which the hospital didn't.

I enjoy this theatre, I just wish the arm rests would recline up so I can snuggle with my babes.  Theater was really clean when we got there, felt bad I spilled my popcorn it was so spotless.  Staff is friendly and managers make their prescence known which is comforting.

I will only come here when George the car wash manager is here. His service to me and honesty is what I truly value in customer service. He is a great man who was completely complimentary to me after I experience such a terrible lack of wash on 3rd and bell - read the review.   After I received my vehicle with lack luster experience seeking my money back George was kind enough to speak with me and provide me with the corporate number to speak with them about my services the previous day.   He then caught up with me as I was waking away and he asked if I was in a hurry and I wasn't. So he took my vehicle and washed it took care of it complimentary. I just wish I had cash to give him for a tip.

I'd like to see the drug tests they require of some of these employees, also if someone has over the minimum items in express check out.  all the employee says is oh i cant say anything, but the 3 people who have 5 items or less are waiting and waiting and waiting.    if i wanted to be a dentist id go to school for it.  I dont think it is very appropriate to open your mouth wide enough for me to see your tonsils.    if youe tired go to bed.  worst walmart ever!!!!!!  the one star is being yelp requires it,  thats charity

Two stars for convience however when it comes to service absolutely none!!!  this location is right across the street from my job so stopping here is very quick for me however when the employee  MANNY WITH A MOHAWK behind the counter states,   "oh my fucking god you smell amazing can you please rb yourself on me."    at first i was a bit shocked but hearing the flamboyant voice i assumed he batted for the other team.  maybe a week or two later the same employee asked if i would be stopping in for my wine.  since i do get off work at a time where i cant go buy a bottle if i like.  this is how the conversation went.  no i dont think so. me oh well you should invite me over for wine and fun. him  he has a weird mohawk and sounds gay and acts gay  for him to continuously present himself as hitting on i finally found it to be enough.  my comment: you know what I highly doubt that my boyfriend would like that idea."  he had some sly remark and was being sarcastic,  if this behavior continues i will be forced to file a complaint.    maybe you should hire peopel who dont hit on every girl that walks in

This place is sooooo good its heavenly. just dont go in the afternoon or night if you are expecting fresh doughnuts.  Best advice is to go when everyone else go in the AM I always get the iced ltte, i love the bitterness of coffee.  Dunkin gives me feeling like i am in the simpsons because of the two dds for handles on the door.

Jacob J. Was great for service! Always great coffee! However the service from the kitchen is disorganized. Customers are served before others because they forgot to put an order in. Service from managers is mediocre By the time I got my forgotten order my boyfriend had finished his food. It's uncomfortable to watch someone eat and then start your meal after your partner has already finished.

I usually love any chipotle but i Had a bad experience with the service here.  When unasked for lettuce first in my burrito bowl the girl gave me a dirty look and said "no what sauce do you want. I said again I would like lettuce please." She gave me three tiny pieces of lettuce so I asked again for more lettuce.   I'm sorry since when can't I order my own bowl the way I want it.

ATTN: CORPORATE OFFICE WILL BE NOTIFIED.  To be honest this is the first and last time I will ever be willing to give these people my money......you're lucky yelp requires a star rating because this place deserves none after how I was treated.   I wanted to surprise my bf with a sparkled car. After I was quoted that it would be done in about an hour and a half by employee #183003 Joey, for a complete interior detail and wax. So I went inside to prepay (FIRST MISTAKE)   Here's where you lost my business:  1. I dropped my car off at 1:00 afternoon 2. I'm quoted an hour, hour and a half tops. (I like to give margin of error so I gave them and extra hour) 3. I call to check on the progress of my vehicle after 2 1/2 hours of waiting.  4. IM TOLD MY VEHICLE WONT BE READY UNTIL 5PM, MAYBE 530-6.  5. After I came back and was still waiting a service agent came up to and whispered to me that this location under estimates continuously to customers. Having them prepay then just stamping their receipt to return. Pretty sketchy.   How does a interior detail and wax take 5 hours to complete????  I spoke with Colin, an assistant manager I believe. He told me there was nothing they could do other than get your receipt stamped to come back later. I asked to speak with whomever was higher in management which is David. I told him I was not happy.  Explained that I understood it was a Sunday however personally I have worked in transportation and I currently work for Hertz. It should never ever take over 5 hours for a detail and wax. That if Danny's was honest with me and told me the ACTUAL wait time I would not have when with such a valued package.  David takes my receipt and stamps it. Saying here you go come back and the service will be completed anytime of the year to have the service done.   On a side note: when I received my vehicle there were water spots and dirt all over. The vehicle was barely ran through the wash. No vacuuming and this took 2 1/2 hours???   I look forward to speaking with your corporate office in regards to this lack of honesty and customer service.   I decided to go to the Danny's out in Scottsdale the next day. The manager there, George was completely understanding, provided me with the corporate number to call and receive a refund.

This place is a joke. The service is very hot and cold.  You evnter the store and all the employees scream hello , hey, hi then do nothing.  I was with my friend who was getting a title loan so I just started to look around see what there was.  I walked around the store for 15 minutes before someone came over to me to ask if i needed help. I went over to my friend who was waiting for something to happen or something.    Rico Arellano - Title Loan General Manager is one rude asshole.  As my friend was sitting in her chair not sure what was going on because papers were thrown at her to fill out then quickly taken away from her, given back for corrections then taken again. We then waited for Rico to finish his 10 minute conversation with a customer who was sitting in the booth next to us.  Did not look at his current customer once, Kept talking in spainish to the gentleman next to us.  throws papers back at my friend, saying she needs to sign somewhere that she forgot.  Rico replies I already told you to sign here, my friend replied when? Rico then just stared at her and went back to his cinversation with the gentleman next to me./  After another 5 minutes of waiting for him to finish and him leaving the room to go to the back.  He comes out to tell me friend that shes been approved etc, all while not making eye contact at all, just staring at the ground.  After our business was done I saw him business card and reached to grab one, as I was doing so Rico then tries to sell to me I guess because his demeanor completely changed, trying to get me as a customer.   I told Rico myself, "oh I just grabbed this so that I know how to spell your name in my Yelp review of this shitty service we just recieved.  Thank you." And walked out  If you need a loan, just try to be better with your money dont go to these poor service

Came here for a date night with my new beau.  We sat at the bar before our table was ready. The bartenders were amazing and gorgeous as well. Both were very polite and humorous as well. While in the bathroom we shared a great conversation about how terrible subway was. Our waiter was Joe. He was very nice and explained how they use great teamwork with other restaurants nearby. My date ordered a double with egg and bacon. I ordered a burger with bacon and green peppers, and cheese. The burger was a little soggy and moved way to much in the buns. I eventually took the buns off and just ate the meat. I do like to be more carb Conscious. The food was amazing though I have to say the decor of the place made me feel like I was in a Shasta pool store. Joe was a great waiter though loved my sense of humor. Told him I was yelping and he offered a deal about saving ten dollars to email sign up but who wants another email. Would definitely come back here.

Went here for a random metal show.  Got sucked into the mosh pit and had to punch some guy in the face to get out.    Best place to experience a show.  Mind you, youre in a basement with a bunch of other people so for people to complain about it being hot are stupid, what do they expect people to not sweat.  they are stupid if they think going to rock show they are going to stay cool.  I was looking like a mess after we walked out but it was the best hour and thrilling to not be able to hear for 2 hours in car ride home.  I wouldnt mind seeing another show here

Man this place is packed but the turn over and service is impeccable. Came here and had a special eggs with chorizo jalapeño and white cheddar yummy!!   My friend had a waffle. It was really rich and good as well. Their bacon is thick and wonderful. Hash browns could have been cooked longer but that's ok.   Overall I would definitely come back.

Usually I dread going to this place but it smelled clean  I used the kiosk to get a new tag replacement since mine had not come in the mail yet and I was worried about being pulled over waiting for it.   They should make more of these machines was quick and easy though downside it only accepts plastic. Really just wanted to pay it in cash. I guess that's what the one hour wait was for but I'm glad I went with the machine.

I usually enjoy ordering delivery from here since it is so close to my home, however this past delivery was absolutely terrible.  The guy gets to my place 20 mins after my order, usually they arrive in 5-10 mins, as soon as i open my bag there are no chips.  My appetite is gone.   I called jimmy johns and told them the delivery guy forgot my chips immediately I'm put on hold for a min then there is a new guy I'm speaking to.  I don't appreciate being placed on hold as soon as i call without a prompt or that the person was going to get the manager.  They told me he would be on his way with my chips and as i looked at my sandwich i had plans to get on the road to my friends house not be waiting another 20 mins for chips.   I stood there waiting and finally decided to eat my sandwich however it ha dbeen 30 mins and still no chips,  so I called jimmy johns told them to forget about my chips and to put a credit on my account for the chips and lousy delivery service, this was a total of an hour i had waited.  The manager told me he should be there momentarily and i told him well I'm leaving my house like I planned to do an hour ago not wait for chips.  Needless to say i wont be ordering from this location again.   On a side note If I want to order my sandwich my way don't interject and try to get me to buy something else.

So I'm sitting here with a large group of friends and it's just awkward watching someone in your party eat a side of their dinner. Also our waitress was non existent only showed up for drinks and refills then to bring food. That's all. The servers shouted our orders out so we'd have to tell me who had what. The waitress had a very strong lack of energy. And just really didn't seem like she enjoyed her job.

Went here on Valentin's day abruptly with my man. It was great. Kila was awesome and funny. We got along great and very interest to learn about her South African culture. She did some freestyle on my hand. I love it. The stain is really dark. I want moreeeee.  They also have clothing, jewelry and accessories plus odds stuff like backpacks. All of it has a bohemian/hippie vibe. My kind of style. I love this place. My new clothing shooing place.
