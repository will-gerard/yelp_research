Nice casita that can sleep 6 for $99, plus free breakfast. What a deal. Service was excellent but the catered food was TERRIBLE!

Always enjoy going to your theater.  Never have trouble getting to see what I want to see and your staff is very friendly. Went yesterday to see The Rite.  Loved it!

What a great organization. The Realtors and Affiliates who belong here have almost endless benefits.

Always professional, friendly service. Now if I can get out of here cost free, I will be a happy camper.

Taking far too long to get food. Waited 20 mins to get seated, waited on right away, 1/2 hr for food. The the food was undercooked and cold, after 15 mins still didn't get a replacement. Told our server Jami to cancel my order. BTW...her service was great. I am done with this place, no manager in sight.
