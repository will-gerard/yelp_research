Saigon Pho on Alma School in Chandler should never be compared to anyone else using that name. We went there last night for the thousandt time and still loved the food, menus and taste. This place is a clean no frills friendley and fast service restaurant. Not only is the food terrific it taste good and almost everything on the menu is under $7.00. Yeah I said $7.00 it  not a typo. We had an opening of fried Salt and Pepper Squid or (Calamari) for you Italainas and of course iot was tender and crispy with a geneous portion. I also had to order the Saigon Noodle soup that has Oxtail, Tendons and meatballs which sounds weird but taste out of this world. That bowl in itself is hard for a big guy to finish. That was $6.50. Ridiculously affordable as I could see with whole familie od 12 eating in the next didning area. Depending on the day they also can have live lobster, Tilapia, Crab and so on. Not all the food is made with Oxtails or Tendons so if you not adventurous there's plenty to choose from thta well worth ordering. Try The Cuury Chicken soup with Chicken, Curried Brith, Basil, Bean Srouts and Jalepenos. Way over the top, Huge and oh so delicious. This is one little restaurant  thats worth the drive from wherever you are.

Well I just got back from Elmer's and again as always their Green Hot Beef Burrito or as I call ity was out of this world. Here's a small little restaurant that the kids at Chandler high have been growing on for decades. Whether it's a Burrito ( My Favorite) Taco or Machaca you' never be disappointed. Filaberto's doesn't hold a candle to it and neither does any of the other chain slaughter houses in town.

Was very disappointed with our last visit. We had planned ahead to visit House of Tricks before going to a play. Called ahead to find out how early we should arrive so that we could enjoy ourselves. When we arrived it was not very busy and definitely was nowhere as full as we have seen on other visits. The waiter was pleasant enough but not very attentive. We were with friends and did not want to be pushy or bossy but it took an hour and a half for us to receive our dinner. We really did not even have the opportunity to find out what was going on with our food because the waiter was nowhere in sight. When we received our dinner we asked for our check, shoved our food in our mouths and ran for the play. As we were leaving the waiter said "you should have told us you were in a rush". Honestly I thought that by planning ahead making a reservation allowing the amount of time that the restaurant recommend was enough. I did not think that I had to tell the waiter my plans for the evening in order to get our food in a timely manner. Everyone did comment that it was Restaurant Week but the restaurant was not full and it was early enough in the evening that they should have been able to ensure that we had time to enjoy our food or even check back with us to tell us why our food was taking so long. We were in great company so in no way was it a bad evening. We are just very disappointed that the Restaurant did not take care of us the way they should have. Nor did they even care to return our call to discuss what had occurred. It just goes to show that you do not always get what you pay for $$$$ and especially not at the House of Ticks.

I just ate another one of Lee's terrific Sandwiches. Here's a [place that sets itself apart by baking all of it's own bread. That may not sound like much until you bite into a fresh Baguette that wraps around your sandwich. Whether it's a traditional selection, or a grilled pork or chicken sandwich you won't be disappointed. My Favorite is the Special Combination or "Dac Biet" Which is totally different unless your Vietnamese. It's worth driving out of your way just to eat at the terrific Sandwich shop. Prices are very reasonable, the foods great and the service is terrific.

This is a really terrific restaurant the food was fantastic and their happy hr menu has a ridiclious selection of great food. Oyster's on the 1/2 shell, butternut squash raviolo, crab stuffed mushrooms. The decor an atmosphere is very fun.

We ate at Roy's last night and it was absolutely superb. I choose the surf and turf, the filet was so tender and cooked to perfection. The lobster tail was so succelent and fresh I just wish I had left overs. For once we decided to go without the amazingly rich choclate soffle desert, when it was time we wished that we had ordered it. The Staff is always pleasant and there are so many wonderful dishes to choose from, my ultimate favorite is the misoyaki butterfish with the forbidden black rice. Yes it is a little pricey but well worth it. they have a great happy hour and a prefix menu which allows for most to get a taste of the wonderful food they have without breaking the bank.

The yellow curry here is unbelievable it is the perfect blend of spicy, sweet and fresh. If I could have this to eat every day I would be happy as a clam! Yes the service is slow, but you can't rush perfection!

This is as close to New York Chinese food that it gets. Their salt and pepper calamari is amazing not over cooked or over breaded. The imperial seafood meal is to die for, it has a great combination of seafood and fresh vegetables cooked to perfection. They have a great selection of dishes and some very inexpensive lunch specials compared to the size of the meal. The house special fried rice as my son says has a little something for everyone in it! Don't forget to take home the spicy mustard it is the best! You can sit down and eat but it has more of a fast food atmosphere. We enjoy taking our bounty of food to go!

This is most popularly referred to as Queen Creeks hidden treasure, well they are not kidding. We have been coming here for years and absolutely love every visit. It is a family owned and operated business and they always treat you like family when you come in. This is a very diverse place and has such charm that it can be a casual afternoon place to go or a dress up date night occasion. The food is always top notch and we are never disappointed.   The Cuban sandwich is almost always my go to meal. Everything about this sandwich just screams delicious. From the moment it gets close to your mouth there is nothing more enjoyable.   The name The Deli does not really give you the real impression for what your taste buds are in store for. They have had some fantastic write ups in Sunset Magazine and the Arizona Republic. Check out what the real food critics have to say and trust me take their word for it.   Best of all they really help to provide a great sense of local community by using as many local Food Purveyors as possible. It is great to see them promoting one another especially in these struggling times.  It is located on San Tan Blvd just east of Power Rd on the North side of the street. It is tucked back in the corner so keep your eyes open so that you don't miss it. This is a great time of year to go out and enjoy dining on their patio.  It is a good environment for families or couples. It is just a very inviting place to be and lose yourself in one of Blake's wonderful creations or enjoy a glass of wine personally recommend by his wife Nicole.  No matter what you can't go wrong!

Had such great hopes for this establishment. We have been here four times pervious and it was great the food and serving portions were wonderful. Unfortunately on our return tonight they have redesigned their menu and portion sizes. We questioned the waitress on the serving sizes and she recommended that we bring it up with the Manager since she had, had the same response from several people recently. We have pictures of our food from the previous visits, because we are foodies and like to share pictures of the happy finds we are enjoying. The Manager tried in many ways to tell us it was the same size serving, even though the picture was way more bountiful on all of the previous visits. We finally gave up on trying to discuss it with him and went about our dining experience. Nothing was the same even the combinations on the bruchetta board was different. You can definitely tell that they have scaled everything back to save on cost and possibly even changed food distributors. We are very sad because we probably won't go back and we had been so excited to have a place like this so close to home. We hope they change and if they do please let us know.

Hey it takes some real guts to open up a Restaurant in this current economy, so first off we want to give them a big cheer! We were so happy to have a new place to try and equally happy with the food. They have only been open for two days and still making plans for growth inside the Restaurant. We started off with the mambo platter with Dominican friend chicken and pork. Well the thumbs went up and smiles erupted from everyone's face. Our Friends that joined us that evening are from Jersey and this type of food is popular back there and they were thrilled. The Cuban sandwich was a huge hit and the pickles inside are scrumptious, giving it that perfect snap. The others had pork platters with yellow rice, they licked their plates clean so that was a good indication that it was fantastic. I really enjoyed the Dominican fried chicken, great seasoning on the outside and very moist on the inside. They have a pretty good sized menu and serve breakfast and amazing looking deep dish pizzas and wings. So there are plenty of choices for everyone. We look forward to dining here again!

It's great to have a place like stamps that leaves you happy and confident when having your car serviced. Both Tim and Mike have never let me down.
