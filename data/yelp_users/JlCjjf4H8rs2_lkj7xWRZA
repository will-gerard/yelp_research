I love this place! I have been going to Nu for years (literally, since I was 13) and I love her! She takes such perfect care of my nails, and she does everything you ask with no qualms about it. Sally, the owner, is a sweetheart, and all of the ladies (and Sally's brother!) all work incredibly hard to make everyone leave satisfied!

So excited to hear that this Michael's is soon to be renovated!!   This place is pretty much a clutter of old, out of date supplies that are usually not in the right place and nearly destroyed. I find it incredibly difficult to find anything here, and if I do, it usually has something wrong with it.   I love Michael's as a concept, and I grew up coming to this place with my mother so we could do various arts and crafts for fun. Hell, I still come as a grown up so I can do arts and crafts for fun!   I am looking forward to reviewing this Michael's once the remodel is finished, as I am sure it will turn out to be a much better store! Good luck with the reno!

I just picked up my boys from Puff & Fluff on a Sunday afternoon, and I am very impressed with how good they look!   I called Saturday morning to try to get them in sometime over the weekend, and they had several options available for me to choose from. I decided to bring them in Sunday morning at 11am. It was Jack's second time visiting the salon, but Danny's first. The groomer came out and asked me to show/tell her exactly how I wanted the boys groomed, and she did exactly as asked. There is something to be said about the personal level of service they provide their customers, as our dogs are our best friends and we want the best experience possible for them.   For both dogs, it was $90 total. Each was $45. The website for this business lists the prices per breed, which I am sure can fluctuate based on what kind of grooming you need done.  I will definitely be back with the boys, and will spread the word amongst my friends!

This drive thru is ALWAYS busy, so get here early and don't be in a rush! However, the staff is always very quick and cheery, and they always get my day started right by simply being in such a good mood, despite their cranky customers! Thanks guys!

This place rocks. 'Nuff said.  Cheap drinks, awesome bar staff, stiff pours.. I love this place.  They have seen me at my worst, my best and all in between, and no one passes judgement.  Swizzle- stay classy my friend.

This place is horrible. So, so horrible. Please don't get your car washed here! This is a quick and convenient car wash for me, and I am just so over it. I will make the hike to Los Olivos, because Danny's is just awful. They don't vacuum the back of the car, wipe off my door handles, wipe down the cup holders. Nothing. They mess with all of my seats, don't fix the door mats, then give me a dirty look when I don't tip them. What do they expect?

The Dillo is easily one of the best bars in the Camelback Corridor, with a friendly staff, great drink specials and yummy snacks!   I started going here when I moved into the area, and now I don't mind going anytime of the day! The day bartenders are always super friendly, as are the night bartenders. The food is delicious regardless of when you order it- my favorites are the fried pickles (frickles) and the buffalo mac n' cheese.   If you work in the 16th street area, don't forget to write the name of your establishment on your check so that you can be king of camelback!  Go Aunt Chialda's! ;-)  Love you Dillo!

Ohhh Rokerij, how I love you so!  To begin, I do not think I have ever encountered an unfriendly or rude server here. The staff, both upstairs and downstairs, is incredibly friendly and helpful.  The wine list is amazzzzzing. So many yummy wines to choose from! Start with a glass of wine, then choose a couple of appetizers like the Brie Toasts or the stuffed mushrooms. Then, as a main course, go with the Garlic Plate or the Gumbo. Sooo good. Or the Porterhouse, or the Sea Bass, or the Pasta Heidi.. Can't go wrong with any of those. Even their House Salad is amazing.   After dinner, enjoy some berries and gelato. Not too fattening but absolutely delicious!

I got into my first accident EVER about 6 weeks ago, and wasn't quite sure what to do with my car, or where to go. Thankfully, my mother told me to run over to Select Auto Body to get an estimate on my car to turn into insurance, and the rest was history.  My mom and I stopped by without warning, and Bud was available right away to come look at my car. Without even going over to his computer, he quickly calculated a timeframe and price in his head, which was dead on according to the estimates he pulled up on his computer. Bud REALLY knows his stuff!  While on vacation, my mother took my car in for me. She picked my car up 4 days later, and it looked perfect! Bud and his team even put air in my tires because it showed they were low, AND they washed my car. Not just a quick wash on the outside, but a full on vacuum, clean and service.   It makes me feel really good knowing that Bud and his team are out there, and I think it is great that clearly many others feel the way I do about them. Select Auto Body is an excellent business, and I hope that they do well for many, many more years.   Thanks so much for fixing my car Bud!

Went on a random bar hop one night, stumbled upon this place.  ..Lets fast forward.  The bartender was wearing flip flops, they were out of every kind of vodka that I ordered, and the staff was just clueless. A bunch of girls trying to look good for money, lacked really any kind of brains.  I hate being that girl, but this place is just a trashy dive for washed up men.

I love Frasher's! This restaurant came to my attention several years ago, and it has stayed on my radar ever since. Frasher's is literally perfect for every occasion- watching the ball game, dinner with the family or a late night rowdy bar stop.  The staff at Frasher's is very friendly, and always very accommodating. I have witnessed them make sure that patrons get home safely if they have had too much to drink, and I really like how they always remember my name and what I drink when I come in.  The food is wonderful! They have a great happy hour, but the full dinner menu is awesome as well. They have wonderful flat breads, and their rib eye is to die for! For dessert, make sure that you try the ooey gooey butter cake- it's heaven in your mouth! Seriously!  Some yelpers have commented that the interior needs some updating, but I actually disagree. That is the vibe you are supposed to have- it is an old, St. Louis style bar. So what if there are lots of mirrors and dim lighting? It's fun!

Dick's is as good as it gets for breakfast, brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner, or reverse happy hour.. Basically, for everything!  The Bloody Marys are made in house, and the homemade red chile is definitely a part of it, as they are SPICY! Not really into bloody's, but still want to try one? Get it in a short glass, that way the vodka:mix ratio is better and you can still enjoy a yummy drink! Wine, mimosas and bloodys are $5 until 5:30 every single day, and man can they add up! It is just so intimate and cozy, you never want to leave the place!  My favorite dish for brunch is the Richardon's Combo, which consists of a pork benedict, asparagus and two chicken enchiladas. I like to swap my enchiladas out for turkey or shrimp, but they're all yummy! For dinner I either go with the Pinenut Crusted Seabass (seasonal) or the Dick's Surf & Turf. The Surf & Turf is a 6oz filet topped with 2 bacon wrapped shrimp alongside chorizo and bean flat enchiladas. SO GOOD. If I wasn't on a juice cleanse right now, I would have already called in my order to go.   The only dessert option is flan, and.. well.. its flan. I don't know, you be the judge!  FYI- It is called Dick's Hideaway because it is HIDDEN. It is located on the northwest corner of 16th street and Bethany Home Road, inbetween the hardware store and Lucy's. It does not have a sign. Please, please, do not read this review and then call the restaurant to ask where they are located. These are ample directions!

I went to D'lish for the first time just an hour ago, and here I am reviewing it already!  To begin with, I rolled up to the drive thru with my dog in my lap, making a fuss, and the woman at the window could not have been any nicer! She gave Danny (my Pom/Schipperke mix) a treat, which he happily gobbled up.  Next, I ordered the Breakfast Buzz. Took 2 minutes for the drink, and the gentleman who gave me my drink was very friendly!  Finally, my drink- OMG it is SO GOOD! I'm hooked. Chocolate, peanut butter and bananas, what is not to like? I can't wait to try their food!   Friendly service and good food make this place a must!

The drive thru here is very efficient, and the staff is always nice and friendly, even at 6am on a Monday (always appreciated!). My only complaint is that sometimes my extra hot coffee is not so extra hot :-(

This Safeway is always clean and EMPTY! No one comes here!! If you ever need to do any holiday grocery shopping, come here! You can shop to your heart's content and never be rammed into by a mom and her four kids, an old lady in an electric wheel chair, or an obnoxious group of gaggly teen aged girl looking for cookies to bake for their football player boyfriends. Shop here. It's awesome!

This is close to school and our preferred spot for a quick bite in between class.   The jalapeno cilantro hummus is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper hummus and the regular hummus.   I have had both the falafel and spicy chicken wraps, and they both certainly delivered. Beware- They are HUGE! I took the other half home for dinner both times.  The staff is always friendly, always accommodating our large groups and splitting our checks for us without a moan and groan.   BTW- they have options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores. This place is good for all!

Everyone loves a good hot dog! Now, imagine that good hot dog wrapped in bacon, on Mexican style buns, oh my lord.. I'm getting excited.  First of all, the Nogales Hot Dog cart is located on 20th st and Indian School in a random parking lot- don't let it deter you. Its nice and dark out there, so I enjoy going often in my pajamas.  The standard hot dog is wrapped in bacon and served wit mayonnaise, tomatoes and pinto beans. On top, I generally add cojita cheese, a spicy green chile and mushrooms! YES! Mushrooms! They also have a guacamole type sauce, hot peppers and Mexican soda! They have everything!  I would just like to say that I think that the service is outstanding. The men and women that run the cart are always so friendly and very helpful. They even gave my boyfriend a t-shirt once!   You HAVE to try these hot dogs!

Went here for restaurant week, and they sure did deliver!  The salad bar was RIDICULOUS- seriously, artichoke hearts, shittake mushrooms, roasted garlic! Holy cow, it was insanely good! Could do without the buffet style, but its restaurant week, so I'll give them a break.  The main course was delicious. When that card is flipped to the green side, beware! They come at you quickly, offering you bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, garlic steak.. So much to choose from! The sausage was wonderful, as was the filet. Order on the rare side, because the steak tends to be over cooked.   The desert was wonderful, but I was so full that it was quite difficult to finish it! I had the Tres Leches cake, and it definitely blew away my expectations.  Just to note, they have a wonderful wine list, as well as very nice valet in front! Do visit!

Postino never disappoints!  The service is always very cheery and friendly, even when it is clear they are slammed and have to deal with some rather snarky customers... Doesn't seem to faze any of the servers that I have encountered! They are always quick to recommend a good beer or wine, and they will always hold themselves accountable for any mistakes. Excellent wait staff!  Now, on to the food...and wine.. Yummy! The bruschetta board is definitely the best selection in the valley, and one of the best buys at that! $13.50, and you get to choose 4 types of awesome bruschetta. My personal favorites are the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, as well as the brie and apples. With that said, they ALL are wonderful. And if you make it in later (after 8pm) on a Monday and Tuesday, you get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine all for $20!  OH! Postino's also has a small, but great, selection of salad and sandwiches to choose from if you aren't in the mood for bruschetta.   Postino Central is a great place that is certainly worth a try! Good job Postino!

Tailwinds is such a great place to send your pets! My parents have 4 dogs that range in size and age (they are suckers for the humane society) and they often take 7-14 day long trips. They are gone at least once a month, and this is where they take their pets! Their dogs love coming here, and are often quite sad to leave.  Thus, once I got my dog Danny, I knew I had a reliable place to take my boy when I am on vacation! He loves playing with all of the other animals that are there, and the staff takes really great care of him.   The groomer on property is also fantastic! Danny is half Pomeranian and has quite a bit of unruly hair, so he is difficult to take maintain 100% all of the time. The groomer here gives me tips on how to keep him healthy, and they always do such a wonderful job on him! He is such a stud muffin!  I 100% recommend Tailwinds, without a doubt!

Great local candy shop that has lots of old favorites!  Whenever I'm bored, I find myself perusing Smeeks, snacking on the free delicious taffy given out at the entrance of the store. I also love love love that Smeeks offers fun goodies and off the wall knick knacks, but careful- they can get $$.   Great place to spend 30 minutes or so!

I came here upon the referral of a good friend who had INCREDIBLE nail designs all of the time. Lien is the SH*T!  To begin with, I was a bit early and Lien was right there ready for me. She got right to business, asking what ideas I had in mind- when I told her 4th of July, so was so excited! No one had asked for 4th of July yet (come on people, by a patriot!!). I showed her some ideas off of Pinterest, and there was nothing she couldn't do.   Lien spent about 2 hours on just my manicure, and while it could have been because it was a slow Tuesday, I think it was because she really just wanted to take her time and do things right. She gave me a great shape on my nails, trimmed my cuticles perfectly and got to work on the polish. It is obvious she takes great pride in her work, because she constantly stopped to check to make sure everything was perfect. Lien worked incredibly hard on my nails, and I still can not believe how cool they turned out!  I have a manicurist already that I will be returning to wen I get a normal mani/pedi, but whenever I want nail designs, I will definitely be coming to see Lien!   -Only downside was the price. $45 for a gel mani with designs. However, she literally painted a masterpiece on my nails, so I think it was totally worth it! Thanks Lien!!

I love this place!  Kodi's isn't very big, but they definitely have a decent selection to chose from. Both mom and son are very well educated on the foods offered here and have always been able to help me out when asked!  Only downside is that I wish they carried more pet accessories and toys!

This place rocks.   Anything that comes out of the kitchen in this place is sheer magic. Bean and cheese burrito? DELICIOUS. Rolled tacos with guacamole? OUTSTANDING.   They probably dislike me because I usually roll up in a taxi with my roommate and we're white girl wasted, but oh well.

Thank you Morgan J. for telling me all about Pure Barre! I was reluctant at first, but after my first session, I was hooked.   I work out a lot, I'm young, and I'm in good shape. Nothing can prepare you for the workout that this class is going to give you. It, literally, kicked my butt. It was painful, I was constantly shaking, but man was it worth it!   The music is upbeat, all of the instructors are incredibly supportive and friendly, and they all want you to succeed. Many of them will walk around and ask you to push yourself, and soon you will find yourself pushing yourself further than you had ever thought possible!  I sweat a ton, so I always bring a towel. Socks are required, and I would recommend buying the socks that Pure Barre offers, they are comfy and keep you from sliding on the floor.   ALSO- They sell the CUTEST clothing in the front. Bring your $$ because you will want to buy everything!

I'm sorry, but there is nothing special about this place. Nothing.  I get it. I understand that you have to deal with a bunch of cheap people looking to get wasted off of $20. I get it. But you chose to work here, so deal with it! Don't be mean to those of us who don't mind spending money on our drinks, those of us who appreciate our waitstaff and tip 20%. Be nice!  The food is horrible. Its just god awful. However, thats what you get for going to a sports bar.  Customers- Ugh. You get a weird mix of cheap, lost in the middle of their 20-somethings, and semi-businessmen who want to catch the game after a long day of semi-conducting business. Not my cup of tea.  Zipps, if your waitstaff would be a bit nicer and your customers grew up a little, I might come back.

This place is amazing. AMAZING!! Maybe I am just a bit green and have never experienced a true bagel before (I am a native Phoenician) but Bagel Man seriously has the best bagels I have ever tasted in my entire life.   I stop by here once a week or so before work and usually get an egg and cheese sandwich on an everything bagel, or a cheese bagel toasted with veggie cream cheese. The prices are very, very reasonable. I think they charge me less for coffee than Circle K, and the coffee is much better. I have never been by when the coffee is cold or stale.  The bagels are not the only reason this place earns 5 stars though.. The staff at this place are absolutely delightful. They are all so nice and friendly and work very hard to get you your order as quickly as possible. The owner is always so happy, and it is really neat to see how someones business can really succeed with love, dedication and hard work.   The only thing I want to caution Yelpers about is if you plan on hitting this place before work, maybe call in your order. Sometimes it can get a bit chaotic here, and you wouldn't want to be late to work because you were waiting for your bagel!

This place rocks!  Grant had a private class for us lululemon gals, and it was so great!   The RealRyders here are LEGIT. Don't be afraid to try them- they give you a real road experience, and really give you a full body workout. The spin studio itself is very nice and clean , and the music was great!  Billie gave us a quick ab intensive, and she was wonderful. Amazing how 15 minutes can give you a crazy burn in your belly.  The space itself is really neat, clean lines and modern. I haven't taken a class outside of the private one Grant did for us, but if they are anything like that, I am sure they are amazing!

Jennifer Andre Salon definitely deserves 5 stars! The staff is very friendly and fashion forward, and Jennifer herself is very, very nice.  My stylist, Heather, began working here about 6 months ago, and A) she is the best (though this review is not about her) and B) I am so happy that she chose a salon as wonderful as this one to work in! The salon is very clean and modern, and the shampoo lounge is very relaxing. I appreciate that there is a changing room to put on our capes- it is a nice touch!   This salon is a unique gem, and I highly recommend it to those of you yelpers looking to change up your 'do!  P.S. Heather is SERIOUSLY the best!

Always great service and delicious food! The bartenders here are TRUE mixologists!  Heather and Tommy are both incredible servers, knowledgable of the cocktail, wine and food menus. They will never hesitate to acquiesce any request, and they are sincerely two of the funniest servers that I have ever met. I enjoy every time I come to The House and they take care of me!  FYI- Steak tartare, foie gras, and scallops are incredible.

The MIC is the shizz!  I finally caved and decided to come to the MIC to try a spin class, and boy am I hooked! I have even brought 3 friends to come spin with me, and they all are just as in love as me!   Right when I walked in, I was met by an incredibly friendly staff at the front desk. They went over everything with me, and even took me to my bike in class and helped me get set up. I took class with Todd, and he is awesome! The music is so upbeat, and the black lights are so much fun! Even if you are completely out of shape, you get lost in the music and you won't realize how much pain you are in until you are all done! During this class, you seriously transform your body and mind into a machine, and it is awesome!  The S.E.E.D. Cafe in the MIC is a delight! I tend to get smoothies after class, and they are very open to adding additional ingredients to the smoothie of your choice. I have yet to try any of the food here, though I hear it is superb. There is a cute outdoor patio, and they even serve wine and beer- perfect for a Friday night after spin!   I can't comment on the yoga portion of the MIC, though the popular opinion is that the classes are pretty great.   All local residents have no excuse for not trying out the MIC, since the first class is free for us locals! Go now! Get off your bum and get sweaty!

It's been a couple of months, and I am still obsessed with the MIC. I have explored and taken other spin classes, and I am still in love. Each instructor brings a different quality to class, and its awesome to know that once class starts, you are going to lose yourself for an hour. Walking out of class is the most euphoric feeling ever. Love it!  Keep up the hard work MIC!

Stopped by for lunch on a gloomy Tuesday and the place was pretty empty (think we caught the end of the lunch crowd). To begin with, this place is hard to find. If you knew the previous establishments that were here, you will be just fine, but if you don't- make sure you have your google maps app out!   The decor is beautiful, inside and out. We chose to sit inside, and you just don't feel like you are in Phoenix. Everything was orderly and clean, and it was just beautiful. Did I mention that it was beautiful? Good.  Got to chatting with the bartender and manager, both of whom's names I have forgotten. Sorry! However, they both were very, very nice. The bartender made us some delicious Moscow Mules (THANK YOU for putting bitters in them!!), and we ordered the veggie burger and hummus to share. They split our burger for us, which was very gracious of them. The food was delicious, delicious, delicious. It may have been all of the mayo and cheese on the veggie burger that made it so tasty, but who really cares. The burger itself was perfect!   The manager filled us in a bit on some neighborhood problems, and to that I say- THRIVE ON Vig Fillmore, thrive on!! The neighborhood needs you, and they will come to love you!

Good, yes. 5 stars? Not there yet.  I came in with my family and boyfriend for a birthday celebration on a Saturday night. We had reservations and our table was ready right when we walked in. We were led to the back on the restaurant where they have several booths along the wall. The table was perfect for our group.   Our group started with the burrata. It was good... but too cold. I read another review that mentioned this was an issue for them as well, and looks like it hasn't been solved. All of the burrata was edible, but it was just too cold and not quite as palatable as it should be. For our entrees, our group had the scallop special, the miso salmon and the short ribs. The salmon was just all right. If I was writing this review based on just the salmon, it would get 3 stars. There just wasn't anything exciting about it. The scallops with cheddar and bacon grits really stood out, as did the short ribs. Overall, I would definitely recommend those dishes again. Our group also had the brownie for dessert, which is HUGE. Definitely enough to go around.   As far as cocktails/beer/wine are concerned, we all ordered the Tito's Dirty Martini. Hard to mess that up, and thankfully, Grassroots did a great job on them. The wine list is okay, I wish there was more variety to choose from by the glass. However, I understand it is difficult to offer a lot of wine by the glass if that is not the main focus of the restaurant.   Other than the food just being 3-4 stars, the other thing that bothered me was I felt that our service was rushed. Our server was wonderful and friendly, but definitely wanted to go home for the night. Perhaps this just isn't the place to go and hang out with a leisurely meal. Now I know better.

I love this place! I come here a couple of times a month for lunch during the work day, and everyone here is always quick and very accommodating. The menu is quite large and has a nice range of items to choose from. My favorite items are probably the chicken salad sandwich, the spinach roll ups with chicken, and the chicken marsala.
