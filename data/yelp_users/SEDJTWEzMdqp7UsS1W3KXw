The only reason I go to this practice is because the doctor I see has been my doctor since the beginning of my issues. She knows my history and she doesn't give me any BS about tests, bloodwork, etc.  That said, this is the slowest office ever. When I get there at 3:25 for a 3:45 appointment and I don't get called back to the office until 4:20, we have a problem. The front desk staff leaves a lot to be desired as well. They're never very friendly and seem like you're interrupting them all the time.

I proceeded to watch the four people who ordered behind me get their food before me. All I had was a potato. One guy behind me got the same thing I did (just a larger version) and got his before I did. And when I finally got my potato, it barely had any toppings on it. Really dry. Not tasty. Saving grace is the free ice cream you get.

I always get the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap when I go here - this is the only Red Robin I've found that actually makes it right! Other ones for some reason just don't taste good.  Plus the fries. You can't beat the fries! Ask for extra ranch - they taste even better that way.

This place makes me crazy, I'm not sure why I keep going back.  The food is so-so, I got a taco supreme the other day and my sour cream was on the OUTSIDE of my taco. As in, between the shell and the wrapper. Very helpful.   Plus, they are the slowest place ever. I timed my last visit - from the time printed on my receipt until I got my food was 12 minutes. Seriously? This is fast food people. And it's not complicated. The drive through moves way faster - I'm tempted to go through that and just eat in my car in the parking lot.

First time visiting this location since my younger college-age days, but everything was great. I like the menu they have up (easier to read than the Chandler location) and the tables were all cleaned off about 2 seconds after people left them.   Only 4 stars because my sandwich was kind of lacking in turkey - I got the Honey Do and while it tasted really good, the ratio of bread to meat was too heavy on the bread.

I love me some Sweet Tomatoes. The fact that I can build my own salad of whatever the heck I want without having to deal with a menu choice is fantastic. And I love all the soup options, bread, pasta and ice cream as well.  The Sweet Tomatoes on Southern and McClintock though is terrible. It used to be a regular ST, but it closed and opened as the Field Kitchen experiment. I never went there when it was like that, but I heard it was bad.  The reopening of this location with the promise that they are "just like every other Sweet Tomatoes" out there is so untrue. First of all, the whole place reeks of rosemary from the chicken they grill at the end of the salad line. It's super overwhelming. Second, the options in the salad bar aren't marked (so you get to guess what you're dumping on your plate) and they don't have nearly as many options as other locations.  The layout is horrendous as well. To get to the soups, pastas and breads, you have to walk through the line that is inevitably standing at the ice cream machine. Which is in competition with the line at the soda machine - because there isn't enough room for everyone to get around. And put in more than one soda machine for crying out loud! Especially when the ice takes freaking forever to dispense.  I will continue to go to Sweet Tomatoes, but definitely not this one. I'll drive out of my way to go to one that I know is real and still good.

My husband and I went to see Jerry Seinfeld at Comerica. First problem is that while he stood in line for beer, I had to stand in another line for liquor. And turns out, the line I was standing in wasn't even for liquor, but beer and some other random malt beverage. The liquor line was on the opposite side from the beer - it would be nice if people had a little more info.  The bartender that was running the liquor portion was ridiculously slow. I mean, so slow the wife of the guy in front of me left to go stand in line at the bathroom and came back before their drinks were made. OMG.  The seats are super tiny, very close together and pretty much have zero leg room. I'd hate to be tall and be sitting there. I wanted another drink but I didn't want to get up for fear of having massive leg cramps and not being able to walk back.  Our view was decent, however the sound quality was terrible. Every time someone would talk into the microphone, it would echo all over the place and so we were listening to each joke twice.

This place never fails to amuse me. I can go out there (a drive, but worth it), get a beer and some greasy food and sit to watch all the people walk by all dressed up with fake accents and bowing to the "king" and "queen". Not to mention when we go on Pirate's weekend... then there's a whole new set of people to stare at!  Food and drinks are a tad pricy, but it's a fair/festival, so that's to be expected. I paid $5 for an Ace Pear Cider and $4 for a slice of pizza. Tickets aren't cheap either but if you go to Fry's beforehand you can save a couple of bucks. Helps pay for your gas!

I know Sonic isn't a typical fast food place - you never go inside - but still, the employees need to be a little more cognizant of the fact that we can still see what you are doing.  Stopped there for lunch today and was parked in a stall right outside the door. I watched (after I had received and eaten my food) one of the guys that works there bring a bag of trash outside and set it down by the door. Then I watched as he went and got another bag and did the same thing. Not a minute later, he came out the door with a tray of food in his hands to deliver to a car. Hmmmm... enough time to wash your hands or no?  Also, why put the trash right by the door instead of taking it to the dumpster? Which was a few feet away, and he's on roller skates! It's not like he even had to walk there.  Right before I left, I watched a girl come out and walk right by the two bags of trash to go have a cigarette. Where she proceeded to stand right next to the dumpster. Hello? Take the trash with you maybe?   The food was good - no complaints there. But still - do something about the health and safety aspect of this place.

Came here for lunch for the first time since I'm working up in this area. The girls I went with go here every day. Literally, every day. I'm not sure I could do that - gotta have some variety!  But this place is good, food tasted great and it was super (super) busy. Pretty much all locals from what I could tell and they are here all the time. The owners knew everyone and what they normally order.  Menu seems to have a good selection and all the ingredients were fresh. I could seem them making sandwiches while we were eating.  I'm sure I'll be back if I stay working up here!

It's a good thing they have super good sales on their meat and fish because otherwise I would never come here.   Their produce is only so so.  I buy milk a lot here because it seems to be on sale every week. And then the meat and fish - they normally have some sort of buy one, get one or buy one, get two deal on something. And you can't pass that up.   The service here completely sucks though. The cashiers and probably the least friendly people on the face of the earth. They don't even acknowledge you half the time. And they are all so ssslllooowww. It takes three times as long to check out at this store then any other store I go to.   I will continue to look at their ads and come when they have good sales. But I'm so glad this doesn't have to be my only option for groceries!

Came here for the first time last night - was a little hesitant due to the negative reviews. We saw Batman in the Forks and Screen theater. Loved it! The seats are comfortable (despite what another reviewer said), everything was clean at our seats and our server came by right away like he said he would. We each ordered appetizers and already had drinks from the bar. The food was great! The only negative would be that it's pretty distracting having servers going in and out during the movie. But it's to be expected at a place like this and just something you have to deal with. 4 stars because of price - we had two tickets, two drinks and three apps. It was over $80 - not sure that it's worth that. But good for a once in a while date!

Whopper was dry. Fries were cold. Iced tea was flavorless.  There was also a creepy old lady just sitting in there talking to everyone as they walked by. I didn't respond to her and she proceeded to stare at me the whole time I was sitting there. She also went over to a family with a little boy to tell them "he's so cute I just want to snatch him up and take him away with me". Um, okay. If I was that boy's parents I'd have gotten out of there as fast as I could.  Management: do us a favor and make the creepy people leave the place if they're not there to eat. Thank you.

This place is great for football - they have plenty of screens and give you a TV layout of which games are on which TV. If you get there early enough, you've got your pick of tables so that you can watch whatever game you want.  The morning games are easier to get a table then the afternoon ones - when we left, there was a line out the door and people were pouncing on you to see if you were staying for the afternoon games or leaving.  The food was good too, and they serve a breakfast menu till 10:30.

Met up with some friends for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting more of a "country" bar feel but this place is pretty modern.   Food was good - I couldn't bring myself to try the fried bologna sandwich though - and the beer is served in red solo cups.  Appropriate.  Would love to go back on a busy Friday or Saturday night to see what it's like when it's busy and hear some live music.

Dr. Glassman is a great doctor. I've been going to him for several years, took a break to have a baby and went back to him afterwards. I'm now on baby #2 and after his initial exam he transferred me to my OB again. But after this I will be going back it my yearly exams!   He always remembers me (and not just what is on my chart), remembers my husband an is so nice to everyone. I think that's what makes a good doctor.   He takes the time to listen to any concerns or issues that I'm having and always explains what is going on. He will call you back after hours or in the weekend if he needs to.   His staff is friendly, if a little disorganized. It always takes it ever to get checked out when you leave. Not sure if that's just the system they use or what. But that's really the longest part if the visit.   I would totally recommend Dr. G to anyone!

This can't be a real Rosati's. First, it's not even listed on their official webpage as a location. Second, their pizza tastes terrible. It's not real Rosati's.  Oh, and the people taking orders at the front desk? They have no clue what's going on. I called in an order for pick up and they somehow had my name and number on two different orders. They tried to give me both of them when I went in. No thanks, just want the pizza I ordered, thanks. However since the pizza was gross (as was the garlic bread with cheese), I won't be ordering again.

This place has great food. Their portions are large, we can usually eat off one meal for two nights (for me, sometimes three) and while it's a little pricey, since we're getting more than one meal, I don't complain.  The orange chicken is a favorite, and the lo mein is always good. The crab puffs (I think they call them angels on the menu) are super yummy. I confess, I have ordered the crab puffs and an egg roll for dinner before. Don't judge.  They are very quick as well - I can call them on my way home from work when I'm about 10 minutes away and pick it up right when I get there.

I love love love this store. It's always clean, everyone is friendly and helpful and I can always find what I need. So much so that I can usually never get out of there for less than $100. They've got a computer for inputting your deli order so that you don't have to wait at the counter. Just enter what you want and they'll get it ready while you shop. Their produce section is usually very good (the only exception has been the sweet potatoes are lacking a bit lately, which is probably because they're not really in season), and the seafood and meat counters always have really fresh stuff.  Since it's a Marketplace, there is also a home goods section but I try to stay out of there. I may end up buying the whole store.

Stopped by the drive through to get lunch for me and the hubby.   First off, the girl on the speaker was super hard to understand. Not because of the speaker, but because of her accent. If you're going to put someone on drive through orders, make sure the people in line can decipher what they're saying.  Second, this place has two drive through lanes. Everyone knows it's supposed to go one lane at a time for ordering. The lane next to me had three cars go through before my order even got taken.   Third, my order got punched in wrong. When I got to the window to pay, the girl read off my order AS SHE SWIPED MY CARD. So basically I'm stuck with whatever they want to give me at that point. I ordered a nugget combo meal and a chicken club combo meal. When I told the girl the sandwich was wrong (they had a quarter pounder on there), she called back to someone to have it corrected and told me they would give it to me at the next window.  I get to the window and the guy there is basically throwing my food and drinks at me. I asked him if there was a chicken sandwich in the bag and he said yes. Lesson learned - always check the bag. I open it up and find a quarter pounder with bacon - no cheese. Definitely NOT what I ordered. Not to mention that each of my drinks had three (yes, three) cups attached to each other. Maybe if the guy hadn't been throwing my food at me he would have taken the time to only give me one cup. That ought to throw their drink count off tonight.  Will not be back.

I love Zynergy. Actually, I should say I love Michele - my stylist at Zynergy! Everyone there is super friendly though, and the place is always kept clean and welcoming.  I'm always greeted right when I come in and directed to the chairs to wait for Michele. They have water available and I'm pretty sure they have other stuff to drink as well.  My only complaint is the shampoo stations. They are super uncomfortable chairs, so you have to try to hold your neck up when they wash your hair - otherwise you end up with a terrible neck ache.  But as long as Michele is there, I will continue to come back!

I might have found a new addiction - Freddy's. Not sure why I have never been here before but I will be from now on!  We drove by this place over the weekend and I didn't know what it was, so I came back in for lunch. Their food is great, service is fantastic and it's very clean.  I had the patty melt, which was a tad too greasy, but it's a patty melt so you're basically asking for grease. It was good though. The fries were awesome - I don't normally like shoestring fries, but these were cooked perfectly. And they have fry sauce. Yes, fry sauce. That I think clinched it for me. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but for a person like me who normally mixes ketchup with ranch dressing for her fries, this stuff was YUMmy.  I was too full from lunch to try any of the frozen custard - sundaes, concrete mixers, or anything else - but next time i will have to plan things out so I can have both. Maybe just a basket of fries (with a ton of sauce) and a sundae.

Came here for the first time at about 2 in the morning after drinking all night. Nobody in the place, food was good, service was good. I guess I should stick to visiting at 2 in the morning.   Stopped there today (Sunday) for breakfast. It was about quarter to 8, so I was expecting a slight wait seeing as how it's a Sunday morning. We get there and put our names in the list - 2 plus a high chair - and were told it would be about 10 to 15 minutes. No biggie.   20 minutes go by. They have sat ONE party since we got there. Tons of people waiting now. The hostess is just making up times... Party of 3? Okay that will be about 30-45 minutes. Party of 5? Huh, about 40 minutes.   Then all of the sudden we are told that her manager won't let her seat anyone without permission. And the kitchen is backed up. And a guy came out looking for the manager cause they still hadn't ever seen their server.   Time to leave. Watching from the parking lot, it was a mass exit from everyone else as well.   I understand that you run into problems. However, nobody even came out to acknowledge what was going on - the manager was nowhere to be seen and the hostess seemed to have no clue how to handle it.   Since we were never sat I can't review service or food. But front of the house was a disaster. I still give them 2 stars since I had no issues the last time. But get it together. Sheesh.

This place (Mesa office) is ridiculously slow. The only reason I'm here is because a year ago this August, my eye doctor told me that my retina was detaching and I needed surgery ASAP. This is where he sent me. No issues with the surgery or the doctor who did the surgery. My issues are with the office when you come in for an appointment.   I got here today at 3:30 for a 3:40 appointment. It's now 4:08 and I still haven't even been called. And (as I know from past experiences) once I am called, that's only the first part of the appointment. I go back for the whole "look at the letters and tell me what's blurry" deal and get countless drops in my eyes. They send me back to the waiting room. Then I get called back again to have a laser scan my eyes.  Then send me back to the waiting room. Then I get called back a third time to go sit in a room and wait for the doctor to come shine a bright ass light in my eyes and then send me home.   Honestly? This is a giant PITA. Why not do everything all at once? Don't make me sit here for two freaking hours every time I come in!  Oh, and get a front desk staff that is actually civil to people. The older lady that works there will completely ignore you when you go to check out. She doesn't even acknowledge you if she's busy. It's rude and it's frustrating.

I have been going to Brenda to get my nails done for many years. She is located inside the Total Bliss Salon in Gilbert. I never had any problems with my nails lifting or anything like that. The salon is always very clean and all the instruments used are sterile. Brenda does regular manicures, pedicures, acrylics, gels and shellac polish. She also does different kinds of artwork with all the nail mediums as well.
