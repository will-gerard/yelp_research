I have been here on 2 occasions and left happy both times!   Last time I went here with my boyfriend and he had the pepper steak with rice we also ordered the vegetable tempura which was crispy golden and tasted fabulous! The wait staff is always super nice and attentive. I ordered the pad thia noodles with chicken with a number 3 of heat. It was spicy but amazing! This is a good find! I will be returning!!

I just went here to get a shake and waited like 15 minutes in the drive thru. They messed up my order by putting hot fudge so when I got my shake it was like nuke warm. This was a horrible disappointment!!! Will never be going to this one again!
