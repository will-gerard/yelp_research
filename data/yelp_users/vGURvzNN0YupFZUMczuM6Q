-Ridiculously high summer green fees. (no discount for staying at resort) -Friendly staff and beverage cart girls -Beautiful, somewhat challenging course. -Constantly monitoring, hovering ranger.  Hurry-up golf - unacceptable.   We had some scratch golfers riding our foursome all morning and the ranger was rushing us along too. He asked us to close the gap in front of us by dropping mid-fairway on one hole- we offered to let them play through. We finished 18 holes in 4hrs., which is a totally acceptable, somewhat quick, round of golf. Needless to say, they will be getting a nice letter from me voicing my displeasure with this. When I am paying that much for golf, I want to enjoy it, not be rushed through there.   Nice course, but because of the rushed treatment - two stars.

Went here with a bunch of colleagues while in Mesa. The place has a great location, history, atmosphere and building. The food was OK, but not great. When I go to a steak house (that requires reservations), it better be ready to impress. This place has been around so long that it has become complacent in the service and food they are serving.   Like another reviewer said, the bread is fantastic, but if it's the high-light of your meal, there's a problem. I started with a chintzy (why so small?) Caesar salad and then an 8 oz. filet and baked potato(also really small). I ordered medium, but got medium well. The steak was edible, but not delectable. The potato was so baked that I could only eat about 3/4 of the potato inside.   IMO: the two sides included with your meal should not include the salad. It would have been nice to have something else on my plate rather than just meat and starch.  Final say - better than a Denny's or Applebee's steak, not even close to Ruth's Chris quality.   Tucson comparison would be El Coral quality of food and ambiance, but not as good as Fleming's or Sullivan's.

Keep doing what your doing GN. We have been there twice and both times have been an enjoyable and lovely stay. Our room in the Rush tower was so nice we didn't want to leave it, but had to because, well, it's Vegas. I love your pool and big fish tanks. Your restaurants, bars, and staff are all fantastic.

My first visit to UOPS was for an International Motorcycle Show. The field was pulled out to reveal the polished concrete floor for this huge affair. I was awestruck with the enormity of the place and being on the floor of the building gave me a sense of the athletes' perspective. My only other visit was to the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. We were sitting in the lower section about 10 yard line and had a great view of the action and just used the jumbo screens to watch the far end.   Lines for food, beer, and bathrooms were all fairly acceptable and prices were on par with any sporting event. I had a great time watching the game and would like to come back for a Cards game.

Since there is no other place like it - 5 stars.  So freakin good, I wish there was one in Tucson.  I had the original pasty with meat, potatoes and gravy. Simply devine comfort food. The baked cauliflower and broccoli side was also excellent. I wished I would have tried everyone else's pasty, but I was on a mission to finish mine and that huge 32oz. beer.   Love the old-time photos of miners and traditional pub decor. I can't wait to get back to this place.

I like going to SW about as much as Miller's Surplus. The only problem is that there's only one in Tucson about 30 miles from where I live. My most recent visit to this one in Mesa was just as positive in service and selection. I purchased a new pocket knife for myself but returned it about an hour later because I was not happy with the quality or what I paid. I don't mind paying a little more for something in a store versus buying online, but when the discrepancy is almost 50%, forget it. I have bought clothes, fishing tackle, and a backpack(even less than online) all at competitive prices there, I don't know whats up with their cutlery.   I like going there and will continue to do so. Please open one on the east side of Tucson!

This was my first visit to a LA Fitness and I was quite impressed by this facility. It's the nicest, most spacious, well equipped gym I have been to. I may have to check out the one in East Tucson now.

What a cool place! Kid friendly, excellent Southwest, redneck, country atmosphere. This place would definitely be a blast November - March so you can sit outside and enjoy the fire pits, pool tables, and stage (not so much fun on a sweltering summer night). The dinner I had (fried jumbo shrimp) was reasonable quality for the price, but don't expect fine steak house quality. We had fried zucchini and pickles for apps and both were fantastic. The other dinners around the table looked great and everyone enjoyed.   This is the kind of place that you could hang out and easily end up drinking way too much!   Warning: lots of conservative propaganda and quotes throughout the grounds. AMERRRRICUH, F*&K YEAH!     LOL

WOW. Might as well write 456! This place is AWESOME! Our group of six got the 10 course meal and many prime bottles of Sake. By the time the 5th dish came out, I was in an euphoric state only rivaled by opiates. It was probably the most interesting, creative and delicious [Japanese] meal I have ever had. The only sushi restaurant that could compare to my experience is Mahi in Seal Beach. I cannot wait to get back to Raku!

Excellent fast Mexican food from a clean, friendly restaurant. A big plus was being able to eat chips and salsa while waiting for our big take-out order. I had the chile relleno plate and they were better than some I have had at other Mexican restaurants. The salsa, pico, rice, and beans were all tasty and the portions were huge! The tacos and burritos that the other family members got all looked great and my daughter loved her chicken enchilada and beef taco.   The next time we're in Queen Creek visiting family, I will be stopping at this Filibertos!  BTW, It is kind of hard to find because it is tucked away in the corner of a strip-mall and it's difficult to see their sign. At least they have a road side sign to guide you in.

I have been to several prime steakhouses and V&A is tops. Service was exemplary and catered to our upbeat, party style attitude with my particular group of friends. They did not miss a beat. The server was fun and courteous and not stuffy. The sommelier was the best I have encountered and catered to our requests.  We started with some oysters rockefeller and they were delectable! I had the ribeye and lobster tail. The steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection, the lobster a bit tough, but good, and the mashed potatoes were equally well prepared. She had the filet and quality was top-notch and rich in flavor.   All in the party enjoyed apps, meals and drinks and we left food-high and happy!   What a great way to celebrate my 40th B-day!

We just finished a nice, grown-ups only weekend here. We came for the resort-like amenities and golf course(I'm not a big gambler). First off the place is pretty nice. It has been decorated with modern tasteful designs that aren't trashy or outdated like some of the other casinos in AZ. The hotel room was very elegant and had an upscale luxurious feel to it. The staff was super friendly and helpful at all times - very accommodating.   We got a cabana at the pool on Saturday and watched football, ate, drank, soaked up the rays and enjoyed the crystal clear pool. The food and drinks were very good and service was excellent there too. Occasionally, free liquor samples came around and I can't argue with that! An advantage to having the cabana, too, is that you can easily make your own drinks or drink whatever you brought to avoid having to order $6 drinks all day.   The Saturday crowd at the pool were mostly 20-30/40 somethings, with a few older folks sprinkled in, that like to party  or relax and have a good time. I was wearing a U of A hat and got a little jawing by a few ASU fans, but I can let it go considering I was in their territory. ;)  I would gladly come back to this casino/resort in the future.
