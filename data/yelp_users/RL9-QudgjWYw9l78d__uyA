Great food, very fresh and they use high quality ingredients.  Their pizzas are really good.  They have great gelato.

This place was featured on Diners and Dives, so we had high expectations.  We had 4 types of tacos and a shrimp burrito.  The carne asada tacos were the best ones, but the meat was a bit dry.  The lengua was alright but the pieces were too big.  The shrimp burrito had very few small shrimp in it.   We live in Scottsdale, and I don't think we'll make the trip to eat there again.

Read a lot of reviews on the rib eye;  didn't share the same experience.  I ordered a medium-well steak, and before even tasting it, I noticed that no juice oozing while I cut through it.  I've had medium-well steaks before, and this is hands-down the driest.  Most reviews here describe a rare/medium-rare steak, so maybe it would have been much better if I ordered it medium-rare;  but that's not how I like my steak.  The manager mentioned that anything above medium and the vinegar-based marinade makes the steak drier than a normal medium-well.  Waitress should have probably mentioned that.  Returned the steak and got a prime rib; was average.  Manager was great about the exchange.  My wife had a sea bass fish - was pretty good.  Desert was pretty good too (brownie with custard and ice cream).  Service was great.    I would not go back  - somewhere like Keg is much better IMHO and more cuts/selections for similar level of service and comparable price-range.

Great persian food.  Bread is homemade in fron of you.  Portions are huge, my wife and I always share.  We have been here at least 12 times and food and service are always outstanding.  Food is always great.  We usually have the combo dish (filet and kofta) with rice.  This is plenty for 2 people.  Also, their chicken is amazing.  Never dry and always well marinated.  The lamb dish is pretty good but not the best in town.

This was our 2nd trip there after 6 years.  We convinced another couple to go out with us to celebrate a year of being self-employed.  Unfortunately, we did not have the same wonderful experience this time around and probably won't be back.  We ended up spending $600 for 4 people, and at $150/pp we did expect perfection, which we didn't get.    SERVICE - 3/5 Overall, it was an OK experience.  Waitress was very friendly, pleasant, and provided recommendations.  The only ding here is that the person that brought the food out seemed to be in a rush.  He was scrambling while serving everyone with a spoonful of the first side dish and reached over from the end of the table to serve the ladies who were sitting by the window.  As soon as he grabbed the second side dish 3 of us told him just to leave it at the table and we'd take care of it.   We've eaten at Capital Grille, Flemings,  Donovans, Modern Steak, and this has never happened.    AMBIANCE - 2/5 It was a Saturday night.  The bar area was lively and packed with people.  There was a live band.  The band was fairly loud, which may be OK if they sounded decent.  However, it did sound very amateurish which was annoying and really put a damper on the overall experience.  We even asked the waitress if it was karaoke night, and she laughed.  She mentioned another table asked her the same thing.    APPETIZERS - 4/5 We ordered 2 appetizers, sea scallops and crab cakes.  They were both great, no complaints.   The appetizers were probably the highlight because things just went downhill from there. :(  SIDES - 3/5 We got 2 orders of lobster bisque, split between each couple.  The bisque was creamy, tasted OK, had small chunks of lobster, but the lobster taste was very subtle that the tomato/cream overpowered it.  We weren't too impressed with it.  We then ordered the highly recommended lobster mash potatoes, and the truffle/crab gnocchi.   @ $35 for the gnocchi, we expected chunks of crab;  we weren't impressed with it and it was pretty much untouched beyond the first taste.  Lobster mash was pretty good as we expected.  MAIN COURSE- 2/5 We ordered sea bass, halibut, bone-in rib eye, and lamb chops.  Rib eye was ordered medium, but it arrived medium well to well with barely any pink.  The lamb chops were also over cooked, sea bass was good, halibut had a crust but lacked salt and flavor.  Ended up getting the steak replaced, but the replacement was under-cooked (looked and tasted medium-rare), but at this point we just boxed it and munched on the rest of the food.  For a $50 steak, I was expecting perfection, something that rivals what I get at capital grille/modern steak/Fleming's/Donovan's, but this was a big disappointment.  Oh, the waitress ended up bringing us a complimentary desert to make up for the steak, but I did get charged for the steak.  Bottom-line is we expected perfection, and all 4 of us felt disappointed and let down.

If it wasn't for the high prices, I'd probably give this place 2 stars.  I went with 2 other people, and we did not order liquor, just an appetizer, and 3 dishes, and we walked out of there disappointed, and spent $140.  NOTE: I was facing the kitchen and could see the chef.  For a place that charges $20-35 per plate, you'd expect the pasta to be cooked to order (only takes 10-11 minutes!).  However, the pasta was precooked, but heated up in a pan with the sauces to order.  Any pasta dish from Cheese Cake factory is way better than anything on this menu -- and half price.   For the appetizer, we got 4 scallops. Scallops were smaller than we expected on a bed of pesto.  They were alright, nothing special.  We then ordered 3 dishes, Osso Buco (special), Linguine with sea food combo, and chicken marsala with linguine.  Osso Buco - this was a $35 item, so we had high expectations.  It came on a bed of risotto.  I could see the chef cook from where I was sitting.  The risotto had to be scrapped off the pan, and it was noticeably dry.  The beef was not tender, and clearly needed to be cooked more.  If you've had osso buco anywhere decent, you know it's supposed to almost fall off the bone.  Chicken Marsala had no flavor.  I thought there wasn't enough sauce, so I asked for more sauce, but the sauce was very thin and watery, and just lacked flavor.    The 3rd dish was also OK -- probably the better out of the three.  We won't be back.

Very authentic ingredients, great food.  The sandwiches are amazing, very simple ingredients and very tasty.  A tad bit pricey though.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Italian deli.

Reviews for this place are really misleading.  We went there today, and we were very disappointed.  If you're looking for more authentic Indian food,  this is not the place.  We noticed that the chicken tikka was sweeter than usual, when we asked the chef if it had ketchup or bbq sauce, he mentioned that they did use some ketchup.    We ordered 3 other dishes, biryani, lamb chili, and chicken karahi.  The biryani was not fresh - the chicken was sub-par, the lamb chili was OK - a little bland, and the chicken karahi was relatively the better dish of the night.  Again, there was only one other table that was occupied, so maybe they weren't prepared?  We went there because we were at an event where they catered food from there, and that catered food was much better than what we had at the restaurant.     Not going back there.

It's average Indian, not bad.  Flavor was OK for the tikka masala and the goat curry.  Naan was very disappointing -- more like pita bread than naan. I would give the food 3-stars.  However, for what you get, it's pricey, so I knocked off one star.  I would not be going back there because I can't justify the price for what I get in return.

We went to Christopher's a few years ago when it was at the old location.  It was our anniversary, and we looked forward to a similar experience for dinner.  Unfortunately, we were really let down and both agreed to not give it another shot -- especially given the high price.  A lot of reviews here talk about Happy Hour, so maybe that would have been a better experience but we won't be going back to find out.  Here is a quick breakdown:  service 4 stars - very friendly and courteous.  No complaints here at all.  The only ding is that he served diet coke that was clearly flat and we could not spot one bubble in the glass.  The second one was a bit better but still flat.   18% gratuity was automatically added which was sort of strange, but I would have tipped him at least that much anyway.  lobster bisque 3 stars (had way more cream & less lobster taste)  truffle-infused filet mignon 3 stars - we ordered this medium, it came medium-well to well.  Was lukewarm and the truffle-flavor was very subtle and easy to miss.  Flavor was overall average.  Duck 2-ways 3.5 stars - no complaints here but did not blow us away  souffle - 1 star - This was probably the worse souffle we've ever had.  It was missing some ingredient, but did not have substance or taste.  presentation looked very good though.  We've had this at Zinc Bistro and other french restaurants in the valley and this one was disappointing

Our first time there, so we had 3 different tacos and a shrimp-burrito.  Very fresh and flavorful.  Burrito was surprisingly good, and so was the fish taco and blackened chicken.  We also tried the flan -- this was the best surprise.  Was great!  I don't think you can find anything that will top this place as far as a casual Mexican food joint in Scottsdale. We'll definitely be back.

They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.

Great food and service.  Waiting area is pretty small but we did not have to wait long to get our food.  The oxtail fries were great and the burgers were flavorful and perfectly cooked.

I went there with my wife and the place has a nice vibe.  We were greeted immediately when we walked in and seated.  The staff is very cordial.  We ordered the fries with truffle oil, and they were amazing.  Their burgers are ok. My wife thought the meat was dry and was missing seasoning or salt.  I ordered my burger medium.  I had the wings, and he wasn't too impressed.  For the same price, I think indulge burger is a better spot.

Small portions, average at best.  Service was mediocre.  Would not repeat.  Much better sushi elsewhere.

We love Havanero's and we saw this place right across the street.  Very authentic thai food, very fresh and everything is cooked to order.  We had the tom ka gai (not sure if it is spelled right) and it was very good.  We ordered spice level 3 (from 1 to 5) and it was pretty spicy for me.  I usually order 3 at other thai restaurants and I can handle the spice level.  The panang was amazing.  The fried banana dessert with homemade coconut ice-cream is to die for.  We loved this place and will definitely be back!

We went for lunch on a Saturday.  Without doubt, we were served left-overs from the previous night's dinner.  The fries were not even warm, and they were hard, the brisket and ribs were luke-warm and we could see everything getting reheated in the microwave including the Mac and cheese for our kid that had a generous layer of melted grease on top.  We asked to sub the sweet fries with regular fries because those looked more fresh and cooked to order but we ended up giving up and leaving the place to eat across the street @ indulge burger before they got the replacement fries order to us.  Never again - food was not edible.  Perhaps dinner is different but won't be going back to find out.  If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  Terrible experience.

This is the first and last visit to this location.  I've been to the other locations and have always had a great experience.  We showed up at 12:45 and the signature El-Pastor was still raw - the ETA was around 2pm which is a joke considering when people eat lunch.  Service was VERY slow, we had to send back a quesadilla because it barely had any cheese and the tortilla was barely heated up.  The place was not clean or organized with a lot of dirty tables and stuff on floors.  This is not a good representation of this specific chain/franchise.  Always have a great experience at other locations.

Went with a group of friends from lunch.  Nobody tried the PBJ burger but we all left happy and would definitely go back.  Meat was very flavorful, rehab was a pretty big 10oz portion but cooked perfectly to order, and service and atmosphere were great.

I can see that there are two other reviews here, another from a big PJ fan, Brian.  Similar experience.  We ordered some staples that we normally get at other PJ locations.  Got the Humus with Grilled Chicken.  Chicken was dry, reddish (too much paprika?) and no flavor.  Not the juicy grilled-to-perfection chicken that we're used to getting at the other locations.  Tabuli salad did not have enough dressing and was sandy - they didn't soak the wheat enough?, and the the rice was undercooked in the grape leaves wraps.    Not to mention, the tables are flimsy and cheap looking, wobble, and just an overall horrible experience.  We paid, and before walking out, decided to share this feedback directly with the manager.  She mentioned that they were still trying to work out kinks, and mentioned that she went through the stuffed grape leaves we returned with the chef and agreed that it was undercooked -- which didn't stop her from serving it to others right as she was talking to us!    We also waited ~ 40 minutes for our food.  Was barely warm, and we had our 2 year old daughter who loved mac and cheese, but this one came cold and clunky, so she said "I don't like this mac and cheese!".  Very disappointing.  It is worth to drive the extra few miles to the Shea location.

Probably the best Pho north of Indian School.  We typically have to drive down to get good Pho.  Place is clean, ambiance is good, and great service.  Broth was flavorful and spring rolls with peanut sauce was great too.  Will be back for sure to try some of their other menu items (clay pot, and lemon grass dishes).

I wish I could do 3.5 stars, but I'm leaning more towards four so we will do 4.   Service was great, ambiance was great.  We ordered the pulpo appetizer, which was very flavorful but slightly tough - could be tenderized just a bit more.  The kid's cheese pizza was not flavorful enough so we had to top it with Parmesan.  We got the braised beef on polenta and it was delicious.  Reason why I am not a solid 4 was because of the cheese pizza and mushroom risotto lacked a little flavor and the risotto was not fully cooked.. Will avoid pizza and that risotto on the next visit.  One of those places that are really cool to go back to with friends.

Very good sushi, great service.  Had to wait 30+ minutes for the sea food ramen so ended up canceling it. Wish the server let us know it takes this long to make because we were done with everything and had to sit there and just wait for a while.  We will be back to try the ramen but sushi was very good.
