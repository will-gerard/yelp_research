Would not use as a shipping service, they are extremely slow to process even if there is no one in line. Makes even the post office look good.

Good food, good atmosphere, friendly staff.  Patio is dog friendly, they even brought out water for our 130 pound rottie, he loved it! Great place to take the kids, they love the free chocolate fountain.  Chips and salsa are fabulous!

I highly recommend Dr. Pullins as a primary care doctor. He was very thorough in his examination and responded within hours of having my labs done.

Came here just to get a glass of wine before a movie, service was awful. Took 15 minutes for the wine to come after ordering, by the time it came I had to chug it to make it to the movie on time.

For those of you you who have had a bad experience at this restaurant in the past I encourage you to give it another try.   I have been back three times since the grand reopening and wow, what a difference. The food and service has been top notch every time. Can't go wrong sea bass or macadamia chicken, both amazing dishes.

Have been there 3 times now. We had two of the smaller happy hour apps to start, samosa and the shrimp. Both were great. Happy drink deals were good, had the vodka lassi, good and inexpensive. For dinner we had the tikka masala lamb and coconut chicken, tried a variety of their naan, all were fresh and delicious, favorite is still the plain naan but you can't go wrong with any of them. Service was excellent, really made us feel like they were grateful that we were there.   Recommendation: go durning happy hour and start off with a couple apps and drinks. Being Indian cuisine, most of the dishes have a fantastic spicy flavor; unfortunately my wife doesn't share this same sense of taste, you can request that they keep the spice to a minimum if you can't handle it.

Premium price but worth the extra cost if you have the cash to burn. Fantastic place for date nights, will definitely impress.

My wife had to literally drag me to this place, mainly because I didn't expect there to be a decent pizza/wine place away from Old Town/Kirland/Desert Ridge areas. The place blew me away! Delicious food, friendly service, and a comforting atmosphere.   Atmosphere: They really spent the extra cash and attention in the build out. Three sides to the restaurant, family dining area, a sports bar area, and a patio. Since college football was in play we sat in the sports bar area. There were a dozen or so TV's to catch all the games that were on. The atmosphere here was clean and inviting.   Food: Good selection of wine and beer. Since we were watching football I thought it only natural to go with a cold beer. Was nice to see they had beers on tap that is typically not found around town, gives me another reason to go back there. Like I said before, I had low expectations going in so when our appetizers came out it blew me away; THE best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Next, we tried the wings, not the highlight of the meal but still fantastic. For our entree we shared a ceasar salad and pizza. If you are expecting to get a $10.99, 3 topping pizza from Dominos, with greasy cheese and crust, this isn't the place for you. The pizza is higher end with fresh topping and higher end cheese. Not the type of pizza that makes you want to gorge after, it was light and delicious. Reminded me much of Grimaldi's but with better toppings.  Service: Very friendly staff. Couldn't decide on the beer I wanted so she offered us a couple of samples. Really gave us a fantastic experience, THANKS LAURA!!

I am usually pretty fair on my reviews but this company was AWFUL.  Here was my experience:  Called to schedule a cab ride to the airport 2 hours before I needed to leave. The operator, whom had a very difficult time understanding English , took down my information. Two hour came and went, no taxi in sight. Called the company, same operator as before, to have them tell me that they "ran our of taxis and cant pick us up". He was not apologetic, his response was "call Yellowcab" then gave me their number.    DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!

Like most people are saying on here it is a really unique concept when it comes to sushi. For what it is, the sushi rolls tasted pretty good, people behind the counter were friendly. The cost is comparable to grocery store sushi but you get to be the dictator. Be prepared though, if you come during busy hours the parking situation is chaotic.

I can only comment on their smoothies, which have all been very good (and healthy).  This place is not for you if you're not looking for healthy/real food.   If they dropped their prices 10-15% on the smoothies I would feel better about going there more often (and giving them 5 stars).

Its funny (and sad) looking back at my old gym routine after starting here. Same old routine with little results. SICFIT Scottsdale really changed my perspective oh fitness and what it means to live a healthy life. Not only am I now more healthy than ever, I actually look forward to working out and staying active.

Best sushi place around the south Scottsdale area. Make your way out of the trendy "sushi" restaurants in old town and head a bit south to find this gem. Don't be scared of the outside, make your way in to find friendly staff and one of the best sushi jointsin town. We had a large group come in late on a Saturday and the place was empty. Will be nice to see this place fill up once more people hear about it.
