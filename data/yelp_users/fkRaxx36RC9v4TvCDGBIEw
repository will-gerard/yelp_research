These guys are great I have now purchased two vehicles from this dealership and they are always very courteous, honest, and speedy! I can't stress the honest part of that enough. Most large dealerships you go to will try to swindle every penny you've got by tacking on this warranty and that warranty and eventually the price that was originally talked about ends up being an enormous amount. These guys will be straight up with you and let you know what your final price will be. I'll definitely be back and refer as many people as possible.

My girlfriend placed an order for pickup because she's pregnant and didn't want to go out in the heat and our email confirmation said our order would be ready I  20 min. So I drove here to pick up the food and they apologized and said they don't always get notifications when an order is placed. Now after waiting another 15min I finally got my food then returned home to find out my order was incomplete.
