W@W! This place gave me the best Head of my life. Not only was their Head the Radical kind, but it was also oozing with Liquidmetal. I got two Heads just in case my balls break one of my Heads, I have another one. You know what they say, two Heads are better than one. I also love fondling their balls, more so than Wilson's. 3 balls for $1.99 if you're lucky! I have no idea why Wilson's balls are used for tournaments, as these are the only balls I would ever touch. I wish I had a lifetime supply of Head like Agassi does. That lucky bastard.

The Trout Almondine is heavenly here. I think it's the white truffle oil drizzled on top that makes this so good. Served with a side of string beans, this dish is masterfully prepared and well thought out.

Must get the tasting menu w/ the kobe burger add-on (+30). The Kobe Beef Burger w/ Black Truffle & Foie Gras is an artery clogger, and is literally to die for. That dish is unforgettable. Great service.  Decor: Elegant with tables w/ drawn curtains for privacy.

Naked Girls in tubs covered by rose petals. That pretty much sums up the entrance to Tao. Only in Vegas. The food here was surprisingly good, from the cooked food to the sushi. I was pleasantly delighted with this dining experience and would go back for seconds..on the food of course you perv!

Went there for brunch. You are overlooking the poolside with a beach umbrella over your head . Waitresses in poolside attire elegantly serve you. How can you go wrong?  Must get: Kobe Short Ribs and Eggs w/  Scrambled eggs, potato cakes, barnaise sauce $19

Fairytale Brownies (NY Chocolate Show) - Too crumbly for my taste. Eileen Spitalny and David Kravetz, did I hear right? You sold your soul to the devil for money. Over 2.5M brownies made annually is impressive. Say it isn't so that you sell frozen brownies (per Sophie M.). Callebaut chocolate is a nice touch, but frozen isn't cool in my book.
