I love The Capital Grille! All of their steak options are great, you really cant go wrong. Whatever you do, you must order the Lobster Mac and cheese for your side!!!!! Its my favorite side dish in the world. Its so rich, creamy, delicious, and has large chunks of delicious lobster meat all throughout. You wont be dissapointed!

Went to Postino Arcadia. Enjoyed Postino Arcadia. I would say GO to Postino Arcadia! You cant go wrong with any combo of the bruchetta and the Nine Iron is one of my all time favorite sandwiches anywhere

Roaring Fork is great... Been many times and I've never had a bad experience. Food is always great no matter what I order and service is top notch. They have great happy hour specials where you can get some amazing food for a cheap price. My personal favorite is the lamb shank fondu! Its one of my all time favorite appetizers and I find myself craving it often

Good beer and great food. Never have had a bad meal. They have the best spinach artichoke dip around! The warm pita bread served with it makes it. Parking can be a pain at times though.

The crunchy pork tacos are the best tacos in Arizona! They are delicious, you really can't find better tacos anywhere else. They even won 1st place at the most recent Arizona Taco Festival. It's also has the best patio in old town

Honestly the best Chinese food in AZ. Ive been to a lot of Chinese restaurants throughout the East valley and this place is the best by far! Everything I've had on the menu has been great. I used to go to Iron chef twice a week back when I had classes at ASU's Polytechnic campus because it was that good!! Never once have had a bad meal or experience. The owners are awesome and provide excellent customer service. They also have great lunch specials. I just wish it was closer since I live in Arcadia now and its quite the drive (though I've made the drive just for the food on several occasions). I wish they would open a location near ASU's main campus because I know it would be a great success! Especially since there is a lack of options for Chinese food in Tempe.

I work right behind Chompie's and I'm kinda forced to eat there on my lunch break due to to lack of options. I have eaten through almost the entire menu and have not found one dish on the menu that I ever crave and WANT to eat again. Nothing is really terrible but nothing is really great either, especially for the price. I mean basic sandwiches cost between $12 and $15 which comes with a side of potato salad that is gone after about two bites. When i saw that Man vs. Food came to Chompie's I though it was a joke. That challenge had never existed at Chompie's and they created it just to get on the show. Overall Chompie's has average diner food for triple the average diner price.

This place is the awsome! Delicious and unique hot dogs that you can't find anywhere else in AZ. Everything is fresh and made in house which is what sets this place above the competition. Also the owner is extemely nice and you couldn't ask for better service. Everything Ive had at this place has been great but my favorite if def the Hana Dog! So if your having a craving for a great hot dog, Maui Dog is definately the place to go!

The food here is excellent and I love the staff! I've eaten here a countless number of times and the food is always great. I highly recommend the coconut shrimp tacos, Mexican street cart tacos, crunchy pork tacos, the carne asada torta and the chicken wings! (I know wings at a Mexican restaurant sounds random but they're really good here I promise!)

Hands down the best Chinese delivery in Tempe (and possibly all of AZ). Have ordered from here dozens of times now and have zero complaints. The food is great and the delivery is fast!
