Not what I was expecting from an Italian Restaurant in terms of decor and ambiance but overall a good experience. We were the only ones in the restaurant other than a couple guys at the bar.  A group of us went for a late dinner and happened to go on the half-off wine bottle night. Good service at the table and extremely responsive. We started off dinner with the stuffed mushrooms (they were excellent!) and the calamari (which was good, nothing special). I had the meatball pizza as my entree and it was good, nothing to complain about.  Overall the service was excellent but food was average.

I was extremely underwhelmed.  The decor fit a higher end Persian restaurant and the service was average. I am not normally a fan of basil but the basil and onion with their homemade bread was good.  We started off with the hoummos and eggplant but they messed the order up! As the entrée, we ordered the Tour of Persia and a large Greek salad with a skewer of chicken. The portions were good but it all went down hill from here. The rice was undercooked to the point that it frequently got stuck in my teeth. The chicken was undercooked,  as well,  but was seasoned well. The salad was extremely poorly cut and was difficult to eat because of that.   Then at the very end they kept both appetizers on the bill, even though we only ate one!   I had heard a lot of good things about this place but I won't be coming back anytime soon.

I came here with a friend for dinner last night and it definitely lived up to expectations! We got two pizzas and the cauliflower appetizer off the happy hour menu and they were excellent.   We tried the funghi pizza based on the recommendation of a friend and they were great! The cauliflower dish was excellent to share and was a good started before the pizza. 8 inch was perfect as a personal pizza.  They have great outdoor or indoor seating and isn't too loud. Parking was a bit of a pain but the food was worth dealing with it. I would definitely come back again!

I have eaten at Mijana a number of times and they all have been great experiences! I have grown up with my mom's home cooked Lebanese dishes my whole life and this food was still great! The appetizer sampler was excellent, as was the chicken shawarma plate my father ordered. An added bonus was the Al Maza beer (Lebanese beer) my father and I ordered! Great atmosphere for dinner, with music and a belly dancer.

This place is excellent (and well priced) for a casual sushi experience. The largest draw was the conveyor belt and the amount of choices I had to choose from. I liked being able to order the sushi in sets of 3 or 4 as opposed to having to purchase a whole roll.   I tried the spicy salmon, the New Mexico and the spicy shrimpy and salmon. All tasted great and could be compared to a number of other sushi places I have been to. My fiancé ordered the veggie roll and said multiple times that this was the best veggie roll she has had yet (tried 6 or 7 different places). We definitely plan to come back again for lunch and happy hour.

This place lived up to all my expectations! I came with a group for lunch and we started off with two orders of the Drunken Bread. It was excellent but definitely rich because of the swiss fondue.   I ordered the Ariabatta pasta,  which was excellent! It was definitely spicy but I was expecting that going in,  but I wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone who doesn't like a medium amount of heat.   Service and decor was spot on. Looking forward to trying it for dinner!

My fiancé and I had an excellent experience with Living Spaces every step of the way! We purchased both our living room and dining room from there and it was seamless. We worked with a sales associate named Audrey and she made sure we had everything we needed.  They had a great selection of furniture at great prices and weren't pushy in their sales. My father even had a question about how they clean all their floors and they asked their janitor to explain it to us! I would definitely go back for any other needs we have and would recommend this to all my friends!

I went to dinner at High Tide and it was an excellent experience! I was recommended this place by a friend and after checking previous Yelp reviews, I figured I had to give it a try.   Decor was nice and simple, with a semi quite atmosphere and good service. I ended up ordering the Tide Roast and my guest got the Salmon BLT. Both dishes were excellent with nothing to complain about. All my seafood seemed fresh and was told the Salmon was really enjoyable. My only disappointment was that I wasn't able to try more from the menu on this one visit!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafood and will be going back soon to sample other delicious foods from the menu!

I have gone to a number of the different casino resorts in the valley and this one by far was the most underwhelming! No alcohol and no table games. I drove all the way out to Glendale and I couldn't even play black jack. I would not recommend this casino for anyone looking to have fun.
