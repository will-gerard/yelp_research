So here I am, me and two of  My bfff's..just got done golfing 18 holes in 108 degrees. Needless to say we're all starving and thirsty.. After what felt like an hour we finally decided on some BBQ. Now we know plenty of hidden BBQ gems  throughout Phoenix but today we decided on Lucile's. So we get there and be bolt right intothe bar section due to the fact the NFL preseason game is on and it's not packed like the regular dining area. So we get greeted by our waiter, I ask him a simple question " what's the difference between tri-tip and brisket?" he replies confidently, " tri tip is a leaner cut from the muscle in the back, and brisket is a shoulder cut, which has more fat. Both very good'" he added.so I go with the tri tip, my one friend gets the brisket and the other gets a steak. ...out comes the food.. Surprisingly mine looks like the brisket along with my buddies, but mine is cut differently. I ignore the appearance and dig in. I immediately notice the amount of fat throughout each cut. I think to myself " did this fucker mess up my order?" I ask my friends and they just think I'm talking out my ass but I know my cuts of meat and this shit ain't no tri-tip. So I ask a random Waiter what my dish looked like to him and he said tri-tip! WTF?? Hmmm that's weird! Now my friends really think I'm talking out my ass but I know I'm right, this is not what I ordered. I start thinking crazy thoughts like "is this some Sort of tri-tip Conspiracy?" I continue to eat what I did not order flabbergasted.. ..out come the check...the waiter begins passing out the checks since we had them separated. He passes the steak check to friend 1. Passes brisket check to friend 2. Now he passes mine without looking. I immediately open to see BRISKET. I experience mix emotions. I am pissed because I Knew he had fucked up And I'm happy Because I just confirmed I'm not crazy and I really Do know my cuts of meat! I notice my waiters name "Tad" and understood why he didn't tell us his name. I bring this conspiracy up to Tad and he stated " I'm so sorry man do you wanna see my boss?" I reply "no thank you". Overall I confirmed the staff at Lucile's do not know there cuts of meat and their bar service is really poor. Eat in the dining room and watch out for Tad bc he sucks.

I contacted Scot after reading all the great reviews of off Yelp and he did not disappoint. I've been needing to get my vintage Vespa looked at for sometime now and was having trouble finding qualified or trustworthy mechanics. Scot was very professional and honest. He took his time and was very honest with his assessment. He fixed the issue and it was nothing  but a great customer experience. Highly recommend The BikeSmith!

We took our daughter's ( 1 and 8) here on Sunday 9/21. The area near the aquarium reaked of urine and so did a few other places within the tubes and such. I personally think they need to sanitize better. I washed my hands 4 times while I was there and today I feel terribly sick. Now, I'm no doctor and am not 100% sure it's the island to blame for my illness however it makes sense with how nasty places like this can be. I hate to have a negative rant but oh well. The kids love it tho and that's all that matters.
