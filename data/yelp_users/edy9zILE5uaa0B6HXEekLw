Thanks Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, the carne asada rocked my world! Great little place with really good food for a good price!

Best option for Indian food in the Valley...had the Biryani which was delicious, and came with a ton of meat for a decent price...not to mention some excellent sauces. I hear the buffet is the way-to-go, but have yet to try it.

Not the absolute best Mexican food in the valley (I reserve that for Padre's), BUT it is THE BEST "hole-in-the-wall" Mexican restaurant in town. Good service (crazy fast with the chips and salsa...and they don't short-change you on those!), and some of the best crispy chicken tacos I have ever had: good shredded white meat chicken stuffed inside a soft shell, and lightly fried for that tasty crispiness...all with more shredded cheddar cheese you could ever wish for.  Make sure you get guac, tomatoes, and green onions on top, too!

Overpriced happy hour. Rolls tasted like the rice was cooked a while ago. Many rolls lacked any flavor, and the gyoza appetizer was mediocre at best. Just not that good.

This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good.   I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now.

I think I heard too much hype...it just wasn't good. Very bland biryani with little or no meat, subpar service, and slow food delivery. I prefer Priya...though the service is not good either...their dishes are delicious.

Second only to Los Taquitos in command of carne asada, this place has one of the best burros...a great option when you're near downtown Phx.

We had a Groupon...my wife loves Australia...and has family from there. Let's just say...we were excited. We ordered all the unique items: surf&turf (with Kangaroo-loin meat), shrimp-on-the-barbie, and the crocodile dumplings. The dumplings were nothing special...a bit over-seasoned and fried from what seemed like pre-packaged, frozen dumplings from Costco. The main dishes looked great...but the shrimp was a bit "old"...the loin was bland and tough...the small side salad was a delicious bit of redemption, however, with a sweet, creamy-in-texture, balsamic vinaigrette of sorts. With all that mediocrity, I must admit that the wine was delicious (we had the Shiraz and the CabSav)...and the bar gave an extremely generous pour for the price.  I hope they up their game, because there is a lot of potential.

Hands down: my favorite place in Phoenix  to hang out. Great beer selection, the jive turkey sandwich with it's jalapeno spread is amazing, and the crusty mac'n'cheese with green chilies has me drooling on my keyboard as I type. The mix of hip-hop/eclectic music with the relaxing patio and great service make for an awesome place to chill with friends.

My buddy, Jeff K., gave this place glowing reviews and recently got me to go and try the burger. wow.   Places like Fez, Switch, Stax, etc, seem to rely on the sauce and fixin's...Zinburger relies on its meat.  They LEGITIMATELY "cook to order" and the toppings are fairly simple...nothing new...but the quality of meat makes the burger as "mouth-wateringly" delicious as a burger can be.  It doesn't get my full five stars, because paying a minimum of $10 for a burger (and NOTHING ELSE on the plate) is a bit ridiculous in a town where quality burgers are being sold on specials for between $3 and $5 WITH fries or salads!  Methinks the Fox restaurants are just a TINY bit pretentious.

Happy hour at the Vig is... a m a z i n g. The portions and prices on all the appetizers are incredible and the simple beer list is still full of tasty, hoppy goodness. You can't pass up the Hot Vings, the Trifecta sliders or the Tandoori Chicken flatbread pizza...they're cheap, they taste great, and they're hearty portions (for appetizers). In fact...all this talk about delicious food...I'm going back right now!

I had the Pollo Torta...and for $7, it is an insanely large sandwich with mounds of fresh chicken and delicious condiments (like the black bean spread or the fresh cabbage).  You've gotta ask for the "avocado crema" to be added to whatever you order!  I was thoroughly satisfied, and am excited about its great location downtown!

It took some time for them to settle in and work out some of the details, but, now, a few months after opening...this place is awesome!  Great food, solid local bottled-beer selection (though I'm hoping for drafts at some point!), and enjoyable service.  I enjoy places that are always testing different items out, and Circle H is always trying to improve: adding a new sauce here or listening to customers comments there.  I hope that Cirlce H is just the beginning of improving the whole 7th Avenue and Camelback shopping area!

Amazing croissants and lemon bars. Their breakfast sandwich is delicious, though very small for the price. The location and atmosphere are great. Overall, a great spot, even if the portions seem a bit small for the price.

The sopapillas were awesome! I tried their fish, shrimp, and pollo asado tacos, as well. The fish taco was ok. The chicken taco was a little dry and tough. But the shrimp taco hit the spot. Great cream sauce with a bit of a kick, too! It's local. It's tasty. It's decently priced. You should check it out.
