I really grow weary of people talking this place up as the place you would HAVE to bring outta-towners for good Mexican food in Arizona. The aguas frescas are really the best thing here. You have to have an early lunch though because they run out way too fast. For the life of me I will never understand why, if there is a high demand for one of your products, you wouldn't make more of it. In the past when I ate here, they would have about 3 5-gallon containers of 3 different flavors. This time they had one and I didn't bother to even ask what it was. It looked like a basic lemonade and there was about 2 gallons left at 1 pm, so it couldn't have been great. The aguas frescas are really the only reason that I would consider 3 stars on this place.   I've been 4-5 times over a period of about 10 years. Every time I go I leave disappointed. The beans are okay. The rice is dry. The meat is average. I've had chicken, carbon, and carne asada, and they all have been just fine. The restaurant is very small and crowded with a terrible layout. I realize that they have probably done the best they could with the space they have, but if there is any line at all people will be standing in line next to your table and orders will be coming from the kitchen and through the line to incessantly interrupt any conversations that you are trying to have.   The hype behind this place probably impacts the harshness of my critique as well. If I was in the area, too hungry to wait and drive somewhere else to eat, or out of gas, all while being in the mood for the semblance of Mexican food, then I might stop in for a bite. Otherwise, there is much better Mexican food to be had in Arizona.

I generally go to Filibertos for a quick carne asada fix. Not that I believe that it is the only good place to go, there is a bit of tradition and a slight addiction dating back to my youth that brings me back to Filibertos. That said, I tried Los Favoritos on a recommendation from a friend that said that it was the new Filibertos.  I thought it was good. It has a different taste, but it was still good. I think I prefer that tortillas at Filibertos, but the carne asada itself was a toss-up between the two. Having had fresh carne asada at Mexican picnics, I recognize that neither are true carne asada, but it serves it's purpose.  I did appreciate the cleanliness of Los Favoritos over Filibertos. I don't think I have ever been to a Filibertos and not felt like there was probably a health code violation or two occurring. That won't stop me from eating there, but it always gets the voice in the back of my head talking.  It is important for me to add here that I don't just simply order the carne asada burrito. I make it my own anywhere I order it. I like mine with the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and sour cream all wrapped up in the burrito. It's the only way to eat it if you ask me.

I was skeptical given I pretty much hate food like this, laden with veggies, but we were invited by some good friends, so I played the part of the good sport. Fortunately, our table had the good sense to order nearly everything on the menu and share. It was everyone's first time at the table so it gave everyone a chance to try a little bit of everything.  We started with the Bella Postino. If I'm being honest, I thought the bread was a little disappointing in terms of quality as well as quantity. We had to ask for more in order to finish the dips. The table did not finish the hummus which I took as a sign that everyone thought it was as boring as I did. While I did not try the artichoke dip, it was easily polished off, a clear thumbs up from the table. I normally go for artichoke dip, but this one was extremely chunky. Seemed more like giants pieces of artichoke and nothing like a dip for me. I prefer a nice smooth creamy/cheesy dip with occasional chunks.  Next we blitzed the menu. We ordered all but 3 of the bruschetta's (left off the seasonal, ricotta with dates & pistachios, and white bean with chopped tomato). We ordered the soup of the day (red pepper gouda), and we ordered a few panini's. I had the Nine Iron, but on the recommendation of our server, swapped the dijonnaise for the spicy sun-dried tomato mayo from the chicken & mozzarella panini. Good call by the server because the mayo MADE the panini. It was excellent. Not too spicy, just a mild kick that really gave the panini a flavor worth coming back for more bites when you had a table full of bruschetta. The other panini ordered at the table was the turkey which also had great reviews from the table. Everyone enjoyed the red pepper gouda soup. Hell, I hate red peppers, but the soup was awesome. I could have had a giant bowl of the soup and some soft warm bread and been completely happy with my visit. Here is a list of favorite bruschetta's at our table in no particular order:  -Brie & apples with fig spread -Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese -Burrata, bacon, arugula & tomato -Roasted red peppers with goat cheese -Salami & pest  That said, the first one was so sweet, it could have been ordered as a dessert. Seriously. We mentioned that to the server and she told us that some people do order it as a dessert.  Now, I almost never order dessert at a restaurant because I generally feel like I'll get a better dessert at a place that only makes sweets like an ice cream shop or a bakery. However, we ordered 3 of the 4 desserts on their menu. Everything but the affogato. The creme brulee was good, but really lacked the fresh fruit that I think makes a brulee great. The chocolate bouchon was a fancy name for lava cake. I'm not big on these lava cakes in general and this one didn't exceed my expectations. Extreme chocolate flavor, but nothing special here to make it stand out over any other lava cake. The salted caramel sundae was the star of the show. Easily the table favorite. The caramel was amazing. The chocolate covered corn nuts were a sweet & salty stroke of genius and they were subsequently rationed to ensure fair distribution at the table. A few of us agreed that we could see ourselves coming back just to order dessert in the future. I only wished I had a Gene Simmons tongue so I could have licked the sundae completely clean along with the shot glass of salted caramel.  Overall, this place was very good. It had something for everyone at our table. It even pleased my picky palate.

I had been hearing quite a bit from family about this place. I had heard over and over about how awesome the mac n cheese was. The biggest reason people had been pushing this place was because of the quality of the steak for the price you pay.  The mac n cheese was excellent! I'm not a fan of the bread crumbs on any mac n cheese, I prefer the smooth & creamy. Despite the use of bread crumbs on their mac n cheese, it was still one of the better recipes that I have had. Not the best, but probably a top 5. The bacon was a nice addition.  Go big on the steak. If you go to a place for a steak & don't get the cut that they say is their best, then you can't pass effective judgement. I went with the rib-eye on the bone, that was the best according to the staff. They were very good about making sure you understood their scale/coloring for cooking the meat. Mine came out a perfect medium. They also took the time to explain that my cut would involve a heavier dose of fat/marbling. I am usually a fan of the fat because it adds flavor and is generally a soft fat that melts in your mouth. The fat on my cut was tougher than I am accustomed to though. There were a few bites with melt-in-your-mouth fat, but quite a bit of the fat was silver skin tissue. Very tough to chew, so I spent a lot of time trying to cut it out of my bites. This left a healthy portion of uneaten steak on my plate as it was difficult to remove the silver skin effectively. All of that said, the steak had a great flavor.  My date had the Blue Crab & Meyer Lemon Filet. Basically Flo's Filet with a blue crab mixture on top served on a bed of grilled asparagus.  I thought the steak was pretty good here as well, but I wasn't a big fan of the blue crab on top. I felt that the seafood taste overwhelmed the flavor of the steak. I'm okay with surf n turf, but I guess I prefer to eat them in separate bites.  If you are looking for the flavor of a high-end steak house, you won't find it here. Although it was very good when you are considering what you pay, it just isn't as good as some of the big names like Capital Grille, Flemming's, Ruth's Chris, or Morton's to name a few. If you are deciding between LongHorn and a Black Angus, Outback, or Texas Roadhouse type of restaurant, I would definitely pick LongHorn.  As a side note, a few years ago Ruth's Chris started a more affordable menu with a 3-4 course meal for $35-$45 per person. I don't know if they are still doing this, but if so, there is no reason to go to a lower-end steakhouse if price was your concern.

We had heard great reviews about this place, so we were excited to try it. We even took advice from people that love this place on the appetizer so as to be sure to sample something that had been vouched for.  The wait to get in was fairly long. This location was quite small, so that was part of the problem, but it also seemed popular.  The service was great. We were provided with suggestions on a completely unfamiliar menu & all requests were promptly addressed. That is were the 2 stars come from.  The food was below average at best. The bread & oil was some of the worst I've had. The bread was bland, flat, & burnt. In fact, the burnt pieces had the most flavor, albeit a charcoal flavor. We had the fried ravioli appetizers. Frozen food much? Yah, they tasted & looked like they came right out of the freezer. If they weren't, then somebody is really screwing these up in the kitchen. Finally, we shared a meatball sandwich. I mean really, that is tough to mess-up, right?? The bread was odd; some kind of flat bread instead of a hoagie bun. That bread was also burnt & the sandwich was dry. We had to request a side of sauce.  The couple we were with raved about a turkey sandwich they ordered, but a turkey sandwich with deli meat requires no cooking, so no wonder that was the best thing at the table. I seriously doubt we'll ever go back. We'd go to Brio or Carrabbas first. Hell, I'd do Olive Garden before this place.

I had heard about Portillos and even though I lived in Chicago for a year or two, I had never tried it. I love Italian beef sandwiches though, so I was pumped to try this place. That said, I wouldn't order the Italian beef without the sausage. Adding the sausage knocked the flavor several notches. I also tossed some cheese on there. It was great!  I thought the fires were disappointing. I did however enjoy the set up and overall feel of the restaurant. I'd definitely go back. I'd like to try some of their other menu items. The options were quite extensive.
