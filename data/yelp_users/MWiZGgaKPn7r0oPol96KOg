The Grimaldi's franchise is NOT the same as the cozy original under the Brooklyn Bridge. Lets get that clear. They are getting 2 stars because they are supposed to live up to the Patsy Grimaldi's reputation. They use half the sauce as the original, which is aggravating because pizza at the very least is SAUCE, cheese, and dough. Since they use the real mozzarella, the cheese does not melt and cover the dough, which is fine because that's how the original is. BUT to have large portions on the pizza with NOTHING on it, its bush league. They charge something like $2 for extra sauce, and extra it is not. I wish they would not charge for extra sauce. If you ask for a side of sauce, they will bring you Calzone sauce, with chunks of meat that does not resemble the sauce that goes onto the pizza. You have to specifically ask for PIZZA SAUCE and at a cost of .001 cents to them, I have to wonder why they are so cheap about it.   Other than this, the pizza is like the original. The service is excellent. The staff is very well trained, although it does seem to have high turnover.

This place is tho!!! GREAT tacos. Fajitas are the best! Margaritas..yummmm. The green salsa is my absolute favorite (tomatillo). I have been coming here for 5+ years now. The food has NEVER let me down. One of the owners is usually on site and you can tell they care about their product. I have recommended this place to numerous out of town friends, and they have always enjoyed the experience.   They have an upstairs area that you can rent out for special events. The atmosphere is perfect for larger parties and fun occasions like graduation parties, work events, wedding showers, etc.  We have rented the space and utilized their catering menu a few times and they have always been very helpful with each event. Very accommodating! Warm staff! You will not be disappointed.

Great Pho. We come here once a week. I have tried the veggie spring rolls, and the garlic chicken, all of which were great!

I've been coming to this place ever since it opened - 4 years or so. I LOVE the food, atmosphere, and the staff is the best! Happy, the owner, cares about his product and makes sure all of the customers are well taken care of.  The bar is awesome for HH. Just writing this review makes me hungry. I'll probably stop by tonight!  PS - The BS reports of food poisoning make me angry. Their Food Safety score is always an A. They proudly display their inspection reports right at the front entrance (its also public record). If you can't handle spicy food, just let them know when ordering. They will make sure it is mild.
