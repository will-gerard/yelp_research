My friends and I came here for a birthday dinner before clubbing at Hakkasan. 8 of us total. We originally wanted to go to Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill but was not able to get a table. We ended up here by chance. The hostess got us seated right away so no problems waiting, awesome. My boyfriend and I decided to share an entree because we wanted to avoid feeling heavy at the club. We also thought the entree portions were huge enough to share after we saw other tables receive their food. Some of my friends opted for the same choice of sharing entrees too. What's wrong with sharing, right?   Well our waitress was apparently against it. I will get straight the the point: She ruined our night and my friend's birthday celebration with her rudeness. With an attitude, she explains to my friends that the ravioli is "only like 6 tiny pieces" suggesting that it was not enough for the couple to share. When my friend orders the caprses salad, she replies, "That's it?" Once it was my turn, I confirmed that my boyfriend and I decided to share the lobster gnocchi.  My boyfriend made a joke saying he was on a diet, and she replied, "I don't believe it one second." She was completely rude to our whole table with her obnoxious attitude and monotonous tone. We all felt degraded and lost the appetite to eat. We can handle bad service at fast food joints but to be treated this way at a high end restaurant is not acceptable because we are also paying for service as well!  My friend who also ordered the lobster gnoochi to himself got the dish first. His entree comes in a rounded white full-sized plate. On the other hand, the lobster gnoochi that I ordered to have shared comes in a boat-shaped bowl, half the size of the full-size plate. The server hands us my portion of the entree and leaves. No one gave us the heads up that our entrees were going to be divided in advance. My boyfriend's portion of the entree has not arrived yet so of course I'm questioning what the heck happened...After a few minutes, our server comes back with my boyfriend's portion of the entree and then explains that it was spilt up by the kitchen which is not a problem; however, a notice would have been nice. Everyone at the table including myself was questioning if the server had thought we ordered the half portion.  On to the food...The lobster gnocchi was very heavy. And oh boy, I'm SO glad that I shared this plate with my boyfriend. The sauce was good but it made me feel uneasy afterwards. My friends who ordered the same entree felt the same way too. And I'd have to say that the lobster pieces were too small. It was good but not great. We also ordered the crispy yukon gold potatoes as a side and it failed us. It was dry and bland, not worth $10. I rather take that money and buy a bag of potatoes at the grocery store! I also tried their lasagna that my friend ordered and it was nothing spectacular. Our bill for the gnocchi and potatoes including gratitude was $58.01, what a big waste I tell you.  After we paid for our bill, my friends who also work for the serving industry politely pulled the manager aside to explain to him our experience. As expected, he did not show any interest, tried to defend the server, and quickly just gave us a short apology. We all left this place feeling robbed. I don't ever see myself coming back but sadly I will always remember this horrible experience when I visit the strip. AHHHHH.

My friends and I stayed here at the signature suite for 1 night to celebrate our friends birthday. My friend got us a discounted room at $110 per night because she knew an MGM employee. This was a steal so woo hoo! We had a good experience here but I don't think it's  the most convenient place to stay if you plan to explore the strip because it was a far walk.  Pros: - The view from the balcony was gorgeous. - The room came with a king sized bed and queen pull out bed. - It was clean, spacious and room service was excellent.  - Home to Hakkasan so convenient if you play to check out the place. - Monorail offered here.  Cons: - Lighting was too dim for makeup. - Half the outlets in the room were broken. - Only valet parking was offered. - Hotel is far from the strip! Expect to do a lot of waking.   I'd love to come back if I was offered the same rate again but I'll stick to somewhere closer next time.

**$17.99 per person for lunch**  I call this place the ultimate kbbq buffet. It also includes various side dishes from Chinese and Japanese cuisine including sushi! You pick your own meats, veggies, soup, rice, sauces, chicken wings, Kung Pao chicken, chow mein, etc from the bar.   I mainly stick with beef brisket for kbbq. It tasted extra dry since there was no sauce to pair it with. I got tired of the it fast, like many people.   The bulgogi was flavorful, but heavy with the marinade.   My favorite was the Korean chicken wings! Crispy and flavorful. I've never seen chicken wings include in a AYCE kbbq menu, and so this was a good find.  Pros + You pick your own meats/food. + Different selections besides kbbq. I didn't try the sushi or Chinese dishes, but I +The chicken wings!!    Cons + No music. This makes it super quiet in the restaurant during lunch. + No seafood options + No dipping sauce = dry meat.  I am still giving this place 4 stars because of the food selection. I probably won't be back, but I think it's good for large parties who want mixed dishes besides kbbq.

AMAZING burgers, shakes and fries ! The hype is REAL.  Burgers were cooked to perfection and the truffle fries had so much flavor w/ the perfect amount of garlic bits and parmesan cheese!  I will make a stop here each time I am in vegas.

I had high expectations for this venue considering that everyone and their moms have raved about it before... It sadly was a disappointment though. My group and I got in for free with equal men to female ratio and got drinks comped because our friend knew a promoter which was nice but the experience itself killed it. The place is super small but it attracts a big crowd so expect to be stepped and pushed on the dance floor! My buzz went away within minutes. It was a nightmare to use the restroom because of the crowd as well. Music was good but it took forever (1 a.m) for the headliner (tiesto) to play. I don't see myself coming back here. I'll stick to XS!

LMB is a great and unique BBQ joint that I'd recommend to any meat lover.  However, the long lines here move very slowly.. So don't come on an empty stomach. I made this poor mistake.  The boyfriend and I got there around 11 a.m. We did not order until 1:00.. They also ran out of fat brisket during this time so plan accordingly.   We tried a little bit of everything:  + Beefy Ribs ($20 per pound) - It was good but I'd probably skip on this next time just because it didn't stand out too much to me.  + Pork Ribs - My FAVORITE! fall of the bone good - great flavor with a sweet and smokey taste  + Chopped Brisket - delicious as well - very tender and moist  +Sausage - can't go wrong with sausages !  + Jalapeno Cheddar Grits - small as a side but very flavorful - recommend !  Pros: Food Cons: Wait
