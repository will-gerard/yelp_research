Went here this weekend with the girlfriend.  Best choice on eats I've made in awhile!  First off, the location itself.  There is a patio facing east.  If you get there at the right time, you can enjoy a beautiful evening with your awesome food.  The inside is very cozy with a great, open floor plan.  You can see all of the friendly staff preparing your meal behind glass near the front.  I wasn't sure what to order so the manager, Ben, gave me a few of his recommendations.  After an awesome conversation, I decided on the Turkey BLT (Grilled carved turkey, smoked paprika mayo, applewood bacon, oven roasted tomatoes with romaine on sourdough) with a Citrus Basil Salad (Spring mix, citrus wedges, cucumber, fennel, caramelized walnuts with citrus basi vinaigrette).  I watched them preparing a salad while I placed my order.  The girl behind the counter had just finished grilling a delicious piece of tri-tip steak.  She chopped it up and paced atop the salad.  I know what I'll be getting with my meal next time I'm here.  Looked delicious!  The food came and the line began to grow.  I arrived at the perfect time to beat the lunch rush.  My stomach was growling and it was on!  The sandwich looked like something out of a photo shoot.  Everything about it looked perfect.  The right portions of grilled turkey breast, crisp, green romaine that hung perfectly out the edges of the bread.  Speaking of the bread, it was incredibly fresh and flavorful.  One bite and I knew I was in love.  The girlfriend and I were blown away by the quality of the turkey breast.  It was grilled perfectly and had the perfect consistency.  The greens gave a great, refreshing taste to accent the turkey.  The smoked paprika mayo danced on my tongue and was the perfect amount.  The bacon was crisp and neither too thick nor too thin.  It added the perfect amount of smokiness to chase the flavor of the sandwich.  My girlfriend loved the salad.  I had several bites and will agree with many before me that have said Market Bistro has the freshest most flavorful greens around.  I felt exponentially healthier just looking at the beauty of it.  The caramelized walnuts added the perfect counter sweetness to the citrus of the dressing and fruits.  Do I recommend Market Bistro?  Absolutely!  If you enjoy Paradise Bakery you will fall in love with Market Bistro.  It's the equivalent of Paradise perfected.  Kudo's to my new favorite salad and sandwich place.    Also worth mentioning is their awesome selection of music (they have their own station on Pandora!).  You'll feel like kicking your feet up on the couch near the front and relaxing after your stomach is full!

My favorite Thai restaurant.  I get their pad Thai noodles and ginger chicken.  They will modify their entrees or make substitutions.  The have this coconut mango ice cream dessert that was surprisingly great because I usually dont like coconut anything.    My girlfriend and I go to Satara about twice a month whenever we're in the mood for Asian food. You can even split the dish for two and just get an appetizer and keep your bill under $30.

Awesome food and great daily happy hour specials that seem to run longer than most places.  Great for pre drinking or after a night out.    It's rare that a sports bar has such awesome food but myself and my girlfriend love everything we've eaten here.  Highly recommend the thai chicken pita.  So delicious.  The service has always been great when we go.  There are 40 inch HDtv's everywhere.  We counted 24 or so.  Only wish they'd pipe in the audio from the games more instead of music all the time.  Can't have everything I guess!

The girlfriend and I went on Yelp looking for a good Chinese restaurant to eat at on Valentine's Day.  Plenty of good reviews so we called to make sure we'd be able to be seated without much wait.  The lady that answered said no worries.  Great for 8:00 PM on Valentine's Day!  We arrive and the first thing I notice is the decorations and lighting.  Everything looks very welcoming and modern.  The lighting is perfect and the layout is very inviting.  We seat ourselves at a booth and notice there are 6 other tables that are seated.    We wait...  Then we wait some more...  Finally, a young girl comes and brings us each a menu and a sheet showing the Valentine's Day special.  We look at the menu and both agree that the Crab Rangoon's look like a delicious appetizer.  I decide I'll have the General Tso's Chicken and my girlfriend is in the mood for the Curry Chicken.  Both items have a small chili icon indicating extra spice.  Perfect as we both love spicy Thai food.  We wait some more.  The initial girl that brought us our menu after we waited when we first arrived hadn't taken a drink order from us or brought us water.  There were 4 servers/employees taking orders this night, mind you.  After a 10 minute wait, a young gentleman finally comes and asks us if anyone has taken our order yet.  I tell him no and he apologizes and takes our order.  He asks if my girlfriend would like white or brown rice with her dish.  Mine comes with white rice by default.  Our drinks arrive fairly quickly along with our Crab Rangoons.  The Rangoons are amazing.  The creme cheese and the crab melt in our mouths and the sweet and sour sauce is perfect in consistency and sweetness.  It even includes a tasty side salad on the plate with a peanut sauce lightly over top.  The breading is light and crispy.  Some of the better Crab Rangoons we've had.  I wipe my hands after finishing the appetizers with the only small drink napkin they brought us.  My plate arrives.  The chicken looks delicious.  The sauce looks perfect and the breading looks awesome.  My white rice comes as well.  My girlfriend waits another 3 or 4 minutes for her plate to arrive.  I wait for hers to arrive as well.  When it comes, the curry looks and smells extra flavorful.  She waits for her brown rice.  I decide to try some of my chicken and rice.  I give my girlfriend a bite as well.  The sauce is good but not spicy.  The breading is great.  The chicken is poor quality.  Nearly every other bite has chicken that is very fatty or what I like to call "full of tendons".  I eat one bite and end up politely spitting my next bite into my napkin.  I flag down a server and tell him that her brown rice hasn't arrived yet.  He tells me "I think we are out of brown rice.  Let me go check."  Nobody told us they were out before when we ordered the curry chicken nor did they tell us they didn't have any when they brought her dish.  They must have conveniently forgot.  He comes right back and confirms they are out of brown rice.  No apology.  No asking if she's like white rice as a substitute.  I share my white rice with my girlfriend.  I eat half of my dish as the majority of my chicken is large clusters of meat that are fatty and/or chewy.  The curry chicken my girlfriend ordered is thinly cut and good quality meat.  I eat several bites.  Not spicy.  The entire time we eat our dinner, the several servers that are working approach the 6 tables on rare occasion.  We are never approached once to ask how we're enjoying our meal.  If we'd like a refill.  Nothing.  I leave my half plate on the table and my girlfriend leaves what she can't eat on her plate.  We sit, talk and enjoy each others company.  We've set our plates towards the end of the table and made it obviously clear to anyone that we are ready for our check.  We make a point to see how long it takes before someone comes and ask if we'd like a box and ask if we are ready for our check.  After 15 minutes, a lady approaches us and asks if we'd like a box.  I say "Yes please" politely.  She takes our food and boxes it and comes back with our check.  I notice we've been charged for the brown rice that they were out of.  I bring the check up to the front and point out the mistake.  No apology.  "That's right.  We didn't have any brown rice."  She fixes the check and comes back to our table shortly after.  When she lays down the check, she starts taking the remaining items off of our table.  Never any acknowledgment towards us.  Never any questions about our dinner.  Nothing.  A young girl runs to our table and brings us a complimentary rose as it's Valentine's Day (this wasn't unique to us as they gave a rose to every table when they were finished).    The service was terrible and my chicken was made from low quality parts it seemed.  If it was busy and they weren't properly staffed, I would have gladly understood the lack of service.  There was no excuse on this night.  I'll never come here again.
