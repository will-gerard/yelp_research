Filling our order this evening, failed miserably. When I received my ready to pick up prompt, I drove over. Only pizza was ready. I waited for wings. Wings came out with no hot sauce and no ranch (nor the extra we paid for). I opened the pizza and it was also incorrect. KJ provided great customer service, so I was not as upset anymore. I arrived home and the pizza was still wrong. First, the pizza had the garlic crust (we had ordered with no garlic). Second, we realized that instead of making a fresh pizza the cook decided to throw cold green peppers (which they had forgotten) and served as such. Needless to say our dinner was ruined. I have never experienced such a lack of concern for providing customer good service. Tonight this store failed to prove that Domino's is a company of exceptional people and definitely NOT the best pizza delivery company in the world. The disregard shown today is a health code violation in the making.

They pay high attention to detail which comes across in the quality of their work. If you want a job well done do not rush them.

Favorite sports bar in town to not only catch an AZ Cardinals game or ASU Football game, but to hangout with friends. During the week, I sometimes drop in for a beer, wings, and jukebox tunes to unwind. On the weekends, we go for the drink specials inclusive of two of my top choices being mimosas and Bloody Mary's. Solo or with friends, I have a good time and enjoy going there.

Very poor customer service. Apparently when you only have one customer sitting at your computer is more important. In addition, very rude sales person who must assume they are the only mattress provider in Phoenix. Needless to say we walked out from what could have been an easy sale and I rather go spend my money elsewhere.

I have been going for years and I have to say it is one of my favorite Chinese take out places. Closest I get to NY take out. The owner is a wonderful lady who has a sharp memory for who you are and what you order.

Every item that I tried was amazing. Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice. A must try in Central Phoenix.

Today was my second time visiting. First time was okay. However, it appears that today the owner/manager was more interested in his bottom line. He missed me ordering their below average breakfast selections and less than okay coffee, so as lunch was nearing he asked that I please move to smaller table (the place was not busy). This would be fine if he had asked everyone in a similar situation, but he did not. Not to worry as I took my business up to Copper Star Coffee.

Best service and best shirts in town. Appreciate the talented folks on your team who always help with design and placement to get the best end product possible.

So, I am writing this review as a current graduate student, alumni and university employee. I very much have enjoyed my meals at Engrained. In fact, it is was of our favorite lunch places to have meetings at. They have a good range of options for every palate. Their quinoa options tend to be my favorites. Worth trying if you need a break from all the commercial spots.

Saturday or Sunday it does not matter. Either is a great day for brunch here. Good options and the mimosas keep on coming.

Best Pita Jungle in town. Brunch was awesome! Whole wheat pancakes, mimosas, and basic pita omelette all were delicious.
