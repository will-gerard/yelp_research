Seriously.  What kind of restaurant doesnt have child seats?  I didnt stay for the food because they didnt have them.  Just looking at the place makes me think it would be a lovely place to have lunch with my other mommy friends.  After reading most of the other reviews, I guess I should consider myself lucky that I didnt spend the money.

I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food.

I saw an ad for Hissyfits in one of those little free booklets. The ad made me want to hop in my car and drive all the way from Surprise to Phoenix. I pride myself in putting my daughter in upscale clothes but I have NEVER paid full price for any of it. I am a consignment store freak and I also love craigslist. The add boasted "upscale and trendy" clothes. I guess my expectations were way to high but all of my expectations were based on their advertisement. First of all the place was a disaster. Beneath the mess I could see that when they first opened they decorated it well. It is now very obvious that they are having some major organization issues. You have to practically climb over boxes to get around and dont even get me started on the furniture area, it was so trashed I didnt even attempt to look back there. The selection of clothes is not bad but it is definitely not what they advertise. It is a normal resale selection of clothes from Old Navy and some department store brands. I would not use the word upscale when describing the selection. There was no one in the store when we arrived and the women at the front didnt even look up to acknowledge us, that kinda bugged me too. I suppose if I hadnt seen the advertisement that made it sound really wonderful I would say this shop is ok. It is definitely not worth a drive from Surprise.

I worked for great clips and it was the worst experience ever.  Corporate expects you to do a 15 minute haircut.  That is do-able.  I can do a pretty good cut in 15 minutes.  Of course that doesnt include any blow dry or style after.  The problem for me was that the store managers expect you to do 8 minute cuts.  There were so many stylist that did 8 min (or less) cuts but they had a ton of re-do's.  I never had re-do's but I refused to rush a haircut.  I got alot of crap for not rushing.  I hated the job.  If you are the type that is in a huge rush this may be a good place for you.  Just dont expect a perfected cut.

AMAZING.  I am here visiting Arizona for two months.  When I leave I will miss my family, but it is possible that I may miss this gym more.  First of all, the facility is beautiful.  It gives the feeling of a day spa and your favorite comfy coffee shop.  Its super clean.  There are tons of machines and I have never had to wait for one to open up.  The child care is great.  As soon as we arrive my daughter runs straight to the play area.  The childcare workers are really nice.  There is a cafe that serves fresh fruit, smoothies, and other healthy stuff.  They have a salon connected to the gym.  I think it is privately owned but it is in the same building.  While I was waitling to have my haircut I thought I would go out to the cafe and get a cup of coffee.  I went up to the counter and asked how much it was and he laughed at me and said the coffee is always free.  Really?  How do they get people to leave when they close at the end of the night?  This place is awesome.  Anyway, I had my haircut and colored and it was perfect.

Best hotel on the west side!   The decor in the rooms made me want to copy it in my own house.  Staff was great, food was tasty, and the rooms were beautiful.

The music was so ridiculously loud that my whole group felt uncomfortable.  We asked the lady at the register to please adjust the volume.  She was very rude and refused.  I told her that we were leaving only because of the volume of the radio. If it was lower we would stay.  I only told her this so they would understand that 4 women with money to spend were leaving because of something that could be fixed very easily.   She was so rude about it that we will never step foot in that store again.
