One of the few pub grub joints in town with character. Ask for seating in intimate dining rooms upstairs for better experience and service.  Pros: The only place in Tempe, or the Valley for that matter, that I go for Ostyers on the half shell that are affordable at $12 per doz. Clam chowder and Onion au gratin soup are solid plays at $4 per cup. Great apps are the mountain of Clam strips for $6 or Cod fish and chips for $10, which are perfect when you're craving something fried to go with your brew. A surprise is the Angus quality beef - try the $22 petite filet with sides.  Cons: Parking sucks. Bouncers checking IDs at the doors are annoying. Hipster crowd smokes like chimneys and makes outdoor patio unusable for dining at night.

All baristas are not created equal. The crew at Seattle Espresso knows how to pull shots. They've got the best iced mocha in town. They splash Illy with heavy cream. Definitely worth driving to S. Tempe for!

HORRIBLE, horrible, horrible service! I visited on Saturday 5/16 at 6 pm. Hostess says we've got a 30 min wait, we'll call you. After 45 mins later and no call our group of 4 returned to check in. Hostess says "hey we phoned you." I call BS as my mobile has phone history and tracks calls, and there was no calls for 2 hrs. She says my list and notes say we phoned. "I say the technology says otherwise. You're either calling me a liar or there's a mistake" She didn't even try to place us elsewhere. We requested to speak with the manager. She refused to call the manager over. Saying one was no one on duty. Wow! Then she ignored us at the reception podium for another 5 mins to wait us out. We gave up when no more action was happening from the service side of Pomo. There's too many good pizza joints in downtown Phoenix to put up with this. Pomo will see us No Mo!
