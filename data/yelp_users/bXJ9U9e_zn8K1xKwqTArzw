Very nice restuarant, clean, good food, and great service. And did i mention, the guy who helped up was gorgeous! It's directly across the street from My Florist on McDowell, which in my opinion is a great area that i hope will continue to keep building up great new stores and restuarants. Nothing bad to say. Great patio right on the street definately a great place to eat right now when the weather is perfect.

My favorite item is the blackberry bran muffin, it's Amazing. Weekends it can be fierce, parking, waiting in line, and then on top of that seating is like musical chairs. But other then that it's definately worth it. Wish I lived closer because i would be there everyday.

So let me set the scene first, My church social group took a trip here last saturday. We are not your mothers church. The churhc is Community Church of Hope, We are the valleys largest GLBT church so when we desended upon Organ stop Pizza, in LDS land you know we look a little out of place. We had about 50 people from our church come and boy did we have fun.  There was a baptist church a couple rows down from us who didn't see it coming. Now we aren't a bunch of flamers frolicking around or anything but we do tend to get a little loud and generally have a great time. I did recognized some of the music  so I was able to sing along with those.  This is a great place to take anyone over 50.  I do think they might be washing dirtymob money or something since the business is cash only.........which I think caught a lot of people off guard including me.  The show starts at 530  so dont be late !!!!!!

I have been to this bar for happy hour a couple of times after work. They have good Martini specials and they are tasty too! Everything sounds great up to here. So you must be thinking " why would I give this place only 1 Star?"  Here is where I draw the line_____________________________-  I went last Friday Feb 6th, now when we go for happy hour on Friday night I come straight from work. Since Fridays at my work are casual, I had my casual clothes on (jeans, button up shirt, DC shoes) Myself and about 10 other people were waiting in line to get in, when I got up to the front, I was turned away because, and I quote " You can't wear those type of shoes in here" He then informed me that "Skater shoes aren't allowed".  I asked what kind of shoes are allowed? he said anything but "skater shoes" So I said if I had flip flops on that would be ok? he said "yep". So we peaced out of there and I'm never going back.   The End

The lunch specials are good and be sure to get here by 1130 at the latest or you'll be standing in line. Make sure to ask for Timmy, he is unforgettable. Tell him his Friday regulars sent you....   I haven't tried much other then te pizza and the pizookie, which is freaking amazing !!! Give it a shot, it's worth the effort

I have to give credit to the Manager and our Waiter before i start talking smack. They did a wonderful job at easing our troubles that we had with the hostess. This was my first time there, I was with my partner on a tuesday afternoon and it wasnt very busy. We asked for a booth, we followed her and she then tried to sit us at this half table, half booth thing. If they were busy and this was the only table that would have been fine but there was plenty of other 2 sided booths available. When we asked her if we could sit at another booth, She gave this big sigh and said follow me. Now normally they hostess would take you to another booth and then go back to the front to fix the seating chart. But not her, she made us follow her back up to the front and then back out into the dining area and sat us. The whole time mind you copping attitude at us. So within the first 20 seconds we had experienced this bs. We let our waiter know the situation, he let the Manager know and he quickly came to our aid. Was very appolgetic and comped our appetizer. So we are enjoying our food which was extremely good. Mmmmm. and we see the manager and the hostess go into the back. 10min later we see her storm throught the restaurant and then see her walk out into the parking lot. He sent that B*tch home!!!! I was amazed....never had that happen before. Right before we were about to leave he gave us a 10$ gift card to come back.....booyah

I bought a radiator for my sisters car here last week and couldn't believe how cheap the price was. Her car is now running like a champ. The parking lot can be tricky but when your saving lot of dough you look deal with it.

If you think you partners fine grab him where the sun dont shine. Clap you hands and stomp you feet move you buns on down to Charlie's, it's sweet.   Hey at least there is a consistant crowd at charlies, unlike many of the other gay bars in phx. so they are doing something right. They have great drink specials and it's right off the light rail. Don't forget to grab some tasty mexican food from outback by the vollayball court. it's delish.

I absolutely loved this place. I definitely don't live in the neighborhood but if I did I would be a regular.... No Doubt ! I have only had the pizza which I thought was amazing! Not quite as good as LGO but you can taste quality. I would definitely recommend if your in the area. Props to East Mesa.....Never thought I would Yelp those words... :)

As Good as it gets is Right Zizzo's is amazing. After taking my jeans to dozens of places, including Saks and Nordies, Phil @ Zizzo's understood what I wanted and boy did he deliver.   There is nothing in the valley that even comes close to the quality and professionalism this little shop spews.   A+++++++++++ Can I get an amen?

I work right around the corner from this pizza joint. So we go there at least once a week. I am definately a pizza connoisseur so I will give this place ashout out!!! WOOT WOOT. The staff is always really friendly and they decor is also kinda clever, They also have a rooftop patio you can eat on that is cool if the weather permits.  A fun fact, all the water used to make there dough comes from New York. I would call that going the extra mile for authenticity.  I wouldn't go there if your party is larger then 5 or 6 as the place isn't that big.   try it for lunch sometime, you wont be disappointed, and if you are I didn't recommend anything

I have been here a couple of times for Lunch. At first I had no idea why my friends were telling me to pack the meat so tightly into the bowl. I soon found out when we got to the huge scorching hott metal "grill? wok?" whatever it is my food came out delicious. The portions you get for 7 or 8 bucks are colossal! I'm talking Lunch, Dinner and a late night snack.......MMMM good

So I finally went there for dinner. Their pizza is amazing!!! We had 3 different types and all were stunning especially the roasted corn! The crust is out of this world. They also have a great sangria which i had a few too many of.....oops o:).  If you are going to go at night with more then 2 people, I would suggest making reservations and they do have avalet but you can usually find a spot on the north side of Campbell and 40th st.  If you live in the Valley this is a definate MUST!!!!

WTF PEI WEI? I shalnt and willnt be returning to this location EVER AGAIN!  Not only is the cafeteria like dining area lacking personality, it's now remarkably uncomfortable.   On to the real reason we all USED to frequent the Asian affiliated eatery, the food. Unfortunately somebody decided to redo the menu, dropping a few of my favs which was tragic in itself, I mean I didn't even get to taste goodbye. My number one, numero uno did make the cut, Mandarin kung pao and i have always been close. But without the chunky pieces of chicken I have come to love and expect, It seems we have drifted apart. Something we said we would never let happen to us.  Do yourself a favor, avoid this pee wee altogether. ((sobbing begins))

Ladies and Drag Queens beware, the "sandbar" actually has sand outside. Not very friendly to those trying to impress in heels. I work very close to the Sandbar on friday nights after work alot (10-15) of people from my work go there. I have been there quite a few times but not somewhere I would encourage someone to go. I have had some of the food, minichimis are ok, tasty when you are drunk but it's no substitute for Jack in The Box tacos at 2 in the morning.  There are a lot of great options for happy hour this just ins't one of them.

Great little shop, love the decor and the 2 guys behind the counter were very desirable. That aside, the Sandwiches were delish!    I had the Vermonter, with the most amazing mayo-like sauce I have ever swallowed... The atmosphere is comfortable and I will definitely be back again and again, if not for eye candy then at least for a little lunch.

I am a steak lover but I must say this wouldn't be somewhere i would recommend. Our steaks were cooked wrong, had a pretty blah taste and we sat in the restaurant for 20 min before anyone asked us about drinks. The drinks were $9 and were supposed to be "top shelf" uh I thinks not. tasted very watered down and I decided to limit myself to one at that price to quality ratio. The only part of the experience that was worth while the observing the table sitting next to us. Listening to them bicker back and fourth and argue about what they were going to get was quite entertaining....... I would not recommend going there for anyone there is plenty of other options close by that will leave you satisfied

I recently visited the Clarendon Kitchen for the first time. We went on a Sunday after church with about 6 people, myself included. The decor was great, kinda Va-to meets chic. And the urinals made out lips were stunning!!! That was the good......... Here's the bad........ We were the only people in the restaurant and were seated immediately. So I had thought that quick service with our drinks and food would follow in the same foot steps.Boy was I wrong. The table only ordered 2 drinks for the bar, one Bloody Mary and one Mimosa. And with $8 dollar price tags each you can see why....ouch. After about 5 min the waitress brought out every ones coffee and water. about 5 min after that she brought the drinks from the bar. Remember the place is empty. I ordered the Chimichanga, and my bf ordered the patty melt. after about 30 min the chef came out and asked how everything was. We said "good except we do have our food yet" He said I will go and check on it........Wait......didn't he say he was the chef? Maybe they have to when its so busy like this........... Finally when the food arrived, our waitress couldn't remember who got what. My Chimi was enormous in size but pretty mediocre in taste. My BF's Patty melt which he asked for rare come out well done.....oops, close i guess   We stated up front that everyone was on separate checks except my BF and I. When the checks came we had our own check but  everyone else's was together. When we told her she said it's alright I can ring them all, I remember what each of you got.......uh not likely, you couldn't even remember when you were bringing the food. So after about 2 min she came back and said I will just print out new separate bills. "Ya think?" When she came back with those bills she had added the tip in, so now our bill was 8 dollars higher then when bill came out before. Cool whatever, at this point we are ready to run for the hills, it had been one dumb thing after another. When she brought out my friend Danny's change, she told him that they didn't have 19 cents so she just gave him a quarter. What? And after he looked at his bill he saw that he was actually owed 50 cents not 19. Can this girl not count or something? What else can she not do? 1. Remember what everyone got 2. keep drinks filled 3. listen.  So all in all I might go back  but maybe only for a dip in the fabulous pool.  One other note, They should get music that compliments the atmosphere, decor and the food......

A wonderful downtown restaurant. Although pretty small inside, the food has giant taste! The parking can be a bitch on Sunday morning but if you love close it's right off the light rail. They have this delicious salad, I believe it's called a Mediterranean or something of that nature. They also have a remarkable grill cheese with brie cheese and scrumptious apple wood bacon. YUM! And to top that off they have 3 dollar Mimosas. And on occasion you might catch News Channel 3's Ross Shimabuku there.........shhhhh

Hula's is the Bomb and all that.   Ask for Ginger she will rock your world. I love the BBQ ribs, tacos and the steak. Their prices are reasonable and it's usually sets the night off on the right foot. Wasabi Mashed potatoes are delish and would HIGHLY recommend them!  Thank you Hulas for being My friendly neighborhood eatery that is close enough to stumble home from after  few too many Zombie's and Painkillers. (Both are adult beverages)

Let me start off by saying I would never go back. The prices didn't match the prices they had online and when questioned about it they informed me "Well these are the new higher prices". Um seriously?   The server kept coming over every 5 minutes, asking "do you need anything else?" instead of assessing the table and realizing what we actually needed, and extra plate to feed my niece, water in our water glasses, and for her to give us time to eat without interrupting.   I didn't particularly care for my BBQ quesadilla and my sister hated her Spicy veggie tacos. so all in all I wouldn't ever be a horrible friend and recommend this place.

OM mutha funkin G!!!!!! This place is amazing. The food was spectacular, and the vibe was perfect.  I had the market salad and for some reason I was craving pears so the waiter offered to add and it was utterly phenomenal.   You have to get the sweet potato chips. perfectly crispy and delish.   This place has it right. Good Job Herb Box. You will for sure see my ass there again!!! Guaranteed!!!!

Fairmont pharmacy beats the pants off any other pharmacy in Phoenix. Close and convenient makes this place my pharm of choice. Greg has a wonderful store full energy and life. There is a sense of trust and rightfully so since he really cares about his customers. Kinda like "how things use to be" I'd imagine, if I were old enough to have lived during the "HTUTB" dynasty.   Don't waist ur time and money at the ever present eye sores Which seem to be on every other corner. You know who else is at those corners? ... Whores! Thats who!   Steer clear of those other stores and whores and give fairmont a try.

Went here yesterday with a couple friends and to be honest, I was quite impressed.  The staff wasn't too in your face and their burgers were phenomenal.   We started with some chicken wings that were scrumptious to say the least and didn't last long between the 3 of us.   A friend and I shared the "Rehab" size of the Chili Burger and it was delish. With the Pretzel bun and sweet potato tater tots, I was in love! Although her and I both agreed " WE WANT MORE CHILI!" on the burger next time.   I am now addicted  and the only treatment is more Rehab.

Recently booked a room for just one night. I live just south of this Motel and when the A/C went out in my apartment my landlord offered to put us up for the night. I originally checked the Hotel Tonight app on my phone, and saw that the Saguaro in old town scottsdale was $59.00 for the night which INCLUDED PETS. Thats right,NO additional fee to get my two doggies out of the hot-sauna-like apt. I would have just stuck it out for the night at home but I couldn't make the pups suffer. So just before I made my reservations with the Saguaro, my landlord called and mentioned the Camelback Sahara, since it was right across the street. So I checked their website and to my surprise,there was $25 pet fee in addition to the $49.00 per night charge for the room. Since my landlord was paying for it and mentioned the Sahara, I decided to go ahead and book the room. It came out to $65.00 after roomstays.com 9.95 fee and taxes but I couldn't figure out how to add the pet charge on my order, but I knew I could just add them onto the room when I arrived to  check in. But when I actually got over there, I forgot to ask about adding the dogs when we checked in. On the way up to the room, BANG!, it hit me that I forgot, so I immediately went back down to the front desk and told the girl my short story about the ac and that I needed to bring my dogs. She told me it was $50.00 fee per dog (and I have 2 of them)so it was an additional $100.00 put my dogs up in the hotel with me. SERIOUSLY? I then told her that online on the hotels website, it said the pet fee was $25.00 and that it didn't specify per pet. She then told me I was looking at the roomstays.com website and that it was incorrect on that site. I again told her that it was the hotels website, I even offered to show her on my phone, which she declined and said all she knows it that it is $50.00 per pet, per night. I told her if she can't honor the price listed on the hotel website that this wasn't going to work and that I wanted a refund. She said since I had already gotten the room keys, and had potential access to the room (which I never made it up to) that there was nothing she can do and that my money wouldn't be refunded no matter what I did. Period. She said it so "matter of fact so" Like you can try but you aint getting a dime back. I told her very calmly that I understand there is only so much she can do and asked for the Manager. She came back with " there is only so much im  willing to do" and that there was no manager on duty until the A.M. I asked for his number which she finally gave me so I left my key on the counter and went back home to the scorching hot apt where I slept with the dogs for the night. The Camelback Sahara sucks. And I will never go there again.   Also it's interior is dated, the elevator is scummy, there is a weird smell throughout the building and the parking lot asphalt is cracked and inhabited by a bunch of feral cats.

I must say for gay bars in Phoenix it's pretty slim pickins but Stacy's @ melrose is holding it's own. I do hope everyman and their brother make Stacy's a staple in their Phoenix nightlife bar hopping. Stacy's usually has a good crowd and everyone seems to be friendly and not too clickish.   The decor is pretty amazing with a medieval theme throughout. The patio out back is lacking a little uniqueness but it's there waiting for some $ I'm guessing to become amazing.     Oh and please leave the girls at home it's a gay bar. Now I don't know about you but I'm gay because I like men and that's what I go to a gay bar for, THE MEN!!

Yea I went with 5 whole stars, why you ask? That's simple because they earned them.   For being as small as the space is they really aren't in your face making you feel uncomfortable/awkward which is hard to accomplish and also highly desired when your looking for a new place to go. "Just enough" was the key to making the night wonderful, delightful and memorable. The bartender (who's name is escaping me ATM dammit!!) was great. And that coming from a someone who has been in the industry is saying a lot.  The food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G a sim not just saying that. When your considering picking up the plate and licking it you know that shit was the bomb.com. I had the old fashion which was executed quite well with angostura bitters pushing it that much closer to my heart. I also had the tacos Jalisco mule , minus the tacos. It was delicious and I even got my step mom to try and she was impressed.    The whole experience was one that dreams are made of and I really hope they stay busy and stick around. Furthermore I hope they become a staple in the old town district.  Yum
