Got a shampoo & blowout and it was great! The school was nicer inside than I was expecting.  Definitely worth the money to give it a try.

Another vote for Pamela! She's fantastic and so sweet. She's professional, takes her time and made the experience comfortable. :)

These guys honestly do not even deserve one star. DO NOT take your vehicle here even for an oil change. They are the absolute worst. They won't call you when your vehicle is done (even after you waiting inside for two hours because they told you it would be about 30 minutes). I have been a couple times because it's close but I will never give them my money again. Awful.

We had a great experience here. The service & food were fantastic. Definitely a fun place to celebrate a birthday as well!

I really only make reviews if something is amazing or terrible. In this case it was terrible. My family of six went to Mi Familia for dinner and we were all pretty disappointed. It all tasted like something we could have thrown together with Wal Mart tortillas, canned refried beans, etc. I'm not a picky eater but it definitely didn't taste like anything I would ever pay to eat again. Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else.

I had my hair done by Jude and I'm in love! I've never left a salon happier than I did after my cut & color with her. The salon is cute and intimate. Jude has a lot of experience and I'm so glad I found my new go-to girl for my hair!
