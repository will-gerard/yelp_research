Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and for the most part it was a good experience and good food. The service was good too. Waiter was very courteous and explained everything about themselves and the menu. We ordered the two cups of crab bisque which was good, oysters Rockefeller which I thought was ok, stone crab legs were good, crab cakes and lobster sole which was our main dishes were ok. Overall it was a good experience and service was good.

My girlfriend and I have been to Oyshi Sushi a couple of times and have thought that the food was good. Nothing spectacular. We have always gone if we are craving sushi and they have an AYCE option. We've never had the problem of getting seated right away which other people have mentioned, but I don't blame them because their staff and customer service is plain out horrible.  The first time my girlfriend took my to Oyshi she had an issue with the customer service that the waitress was giving her. She did not clarify the oysters which was a part of the AYCE and after she was very rude. After taking our order we saw her twice and then thereafter other waitresses had to take our order and deliver our food.  Our second time going to Oyshi it was fine. We were seated in a timely manner and received our orders of AYCE sushi without any issues.  The third time we went to Oyshi is WHY IM WRITING THIS REVIEW and have joined YELP and is also why I'm NOT GOING BACK THERE. We were seated in a timely manner and our order was taken in a timely manner as well, but after the waitress (Pinky) took our order of AYCE we never saw her again. That's when everything fell apart. Our food took at least 20 mins to come out and it wasn't even busy. Not only that, we always order baked mussels with our order  and that never came out to the point where we order a second round. We had to call over the host or the manager or whoever the guy that was dressed up with a tie was. When Pinky never came back a young waiter started to follow up on us. This waiter was "AWESOME!" NOT!!! The guy would only look at my girlfriend and never acknowledged me at all. I had to flag the guy down to get a refill on my drink because he would just ask my GF and leave. After waiting and losing our appetites we didn't even ask for dessert which is a part of the AYCE. We were so disgusted with the service that we just asked for the bill.  Lastly, THIS IS WHY I GAVE THEM A ONE STAR...  My bill came out to be $61.62 and because of the wait and the horrible customer service I DID NOT TIP THEM. SO TELL ME WHY AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS MY ACCOUNT WAS CHARGED $72?!?!?!?   Those ******** CHARGED MY CARD AN EXTRA $10.38 meaning they tipped themselves and FRAUDULENTLY CHARGED my card EXTRA!!!!  At what point do they think they deserve my $10.38?!?!  Never go to OYSHI SUSHI!!!! EVER!!!

Good and to the point. What we needed on a cold windy day after a long days work. Ordered spicy miso ramen with a side of fried gyoza and a coke. The ramen was good along with the spice. On the other hand the gyoza was okay. The service was good as well, fast and courteous.
