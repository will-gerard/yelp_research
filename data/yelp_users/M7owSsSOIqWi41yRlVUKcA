Postino's is one of my all time favorite restaurants!! They have the yummiest bruschetta, salads, sandwiches, etc.  If you are not a bruschetta person you need to try theirs! My favorites:  ricotta and pistachios, white bean and tomato, Brie apples and fig, bacon buratta...well they are all so good!!   Go on a Monday or Tuesday after 8pm for Happy Hour and you can choose any bottle of house wine and 4 bruschetta for $20!! The best place for happy hour!! If you are going to go though make sure you are there by 7:30 or 8 at the latest or you won't get a table until after 9 because everyone knows about Postino's Happy Hour and it is legendary!!   On a side note the raspberry chicken salad is probably the yummiest salad I have ever eaten!!

Food was pretty good! Had the house noodle soup (not on the menu), was good, a bit bland for my taste but it wasn't bad at all. Had shrimp, chicken, and beef. My son also ordered the shrimp and lobster sauce lunch special (he's 9), and he LOVED it. He went on and on that it was the best Chinese he has ever eaten. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 which I would have given for my food, because I did try the shrimp and lobster sauce....it was very very good!!   All in all I would say it was definitely a good experience and I would go back and explore the menu again.

DO NOT GO HERE! I used to go to this nail salon, and now there is a new owner and everyone good has left! Kim is gone and Sue!   The owner did my manicure and pedicure, and he did an Ok job on my pedicure but the callus removal I paid extra for did not remove the actual callus he just rubbed my feet. When I got home my soles felt like I could still take some dead skin off.  My manicure was AWFUL! It looks like a 5 year old painted my nails. Even during the manicure I mentioned many times there's nail polish all over my cuticles, and he kept saying it's because I picked black polish or that I have short nails. Neither of these things are my problem, a manicurist should be able to do a short nail black polish. I keep my nails short because I'm a nurse.  I will not ever be going back to My Nail Salon!

Having my car hit in a parking lot was awful enough, but the guys at Raintree auto body took such great care of me! My dad recommended me to go there, and I am so glad I did! Matthew was my adjuster/estimator and he worked with me and my insurance so I didn't have to worry about any details. Also enterprise was right next door so that was very convenient for my car rental!   I highly recommend going here! Ask for Matt, he was awesome and I would recommend this to any friends or family members!!   -Jaz

Really authentic Mexican food! I moved away from AZ a few years ago, and on the east coast Mexican food is nothing like in AZ. Whenever I go back to AZ I always go here to get some yummy Mexican food just like I would get in Mexico!   Highly recommend but don't expect 5 star dining...authentic Mexican! It's just like eating south of the border!

This place was very nice, with a romantic atmosphere inside; cozy booths and dim lighting. We sat outside as it was still nice out, and enjoyed the patio. The service was a bit slow, but very polite.   As a group of 3 women we tried the steak bruschetta to start and it was simply delicious. The two with me had the bolognese which the server recommended and it was good. I tried the orecchiette which was a fennel sausage pasta, it was salty but good.   I would go here again and try their menu items, some looked really interesting but the service was pretty slow. Maybe it was because we sat outside.
