The delivery was quick and the deliver very polite. I was impressed with the quality you get for the price they offer. I will definitely be ordering from here.

I'm very disappointed a Harkins' would have a screen without theater seating and a screen half the size of the rest and expect the public to pay the same amount for the viewing. I wasted a trip with my children as I was warned about the size before I purchased the ticket. At least put the warning online where I can plan not to go ahead of time.

This is my first experience selling jewelry, after searching reviews on Yelp this place was mentioned not only in the area search but also on the reviews of other places (this place came up on top usually). It was pretty great. The owner was very straight forward and I was sure that I got a great deal. The place was clean, it felt top notch.

This place is a gem! Their Al Pastor meat is amazing and their customers service is fantastic! I couldn't be happier with it.
