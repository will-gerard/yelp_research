Dramatic improvements!!!  They moved to a new location in downtown Phoenix and the food is SO MUCH BETTER!  The first dinner course consisted of a salad with tomatoes and balsamic vinaigrette, the second course is your choice from four entrees (salmon, bone in chicken, beef sirloin, or penne pasta with lots of veggies), dessert was a warm apple crisp.  Dinner is included with the $45 dinner-and-a-show, but beverages are a separate tab.  The wine menu was sparse, but come-on, the real reason you are there is for the entertainment.  We took our daughter for her 14th birthday and it was a lot of fun.  They said the show was PG-13, so I was a little worried.  It was perfect though; she had a blast and so did we!  The actors interact with the audience and you really feel like a part of the show.  It was very funny, and the acting was surprisingly good!  I haven't seen my mom laugh so hard in years!  :o)  The whole family had fun and we look forward to returning to see one of the other shows that they offer.  http://www.MysteryMansion.com/

When my daughter insisted she was eager to have her ears pierced, I asked for referrals on a couple different Facebook "mommy" pages.  This lead to me narrowing my search down to three specific piercing/tattoo shops.  Marilyn, the manager, performed the piercing.  She was really sweet, very professional, and most importantly...patient!  After the first ear was pierced, my daughter suddenly had reservations, and needed some time to walk around and process her thoughts on the matter.  Marilyn never rushed her or made her feel pressured.  My daughter didn't want to leave with just one ear done, so it took awhile for her to come back around and complete the second ear.  I was grateful the entire staff was supportive and patient.  We left with both ears pierced, and a happy girl.  The shop was very clean and professionally run, and we were given very clear aftercare instructions.

We just purchased our 2nd vehicle this year from Chapman BMW.  I wholeheartedly recommend Peter Cramer, in sales.  He was incredibly knowledgeable with both the driving ability and technology of each model.  His test drive was the coolest experience EVER!  Holy cow!!!  Once you see what he can make a car do, you'll have to own it!    Giuseppe Ferrara, in finance, is a genuinely good guy.  He wants to do what is best for you, based on your own personal buying scenario.    Buying a car here is a refreshing experience, in comparison to the cars I've purchased over the past 30 years.  Chapman does a great job of hiring the good guys and gals of the auto sales industry!

I found a Maytag dryer online, which was a good price, but it would be a week or two before it would be delivered.  So I decided to go to Mesa TV & Appliance and see if they had one in stock that we could bring home right away.  I loaded my sister and our two girls into my SUV, and we talked with Louie, in sales.  He was the only person in the showroom.  The same Maytag model was $40 more than the online website.  That was fine with me, if it was in stock, but it wasn't.  So I found a well priced Whirlpool and purchased it, as well as the dryer kit.  We talked about how I had bought several appliances from Mesa Discount TV and Appliance about 15 years ago.      Louie then said that he wouldn't be able to help me load it in the car, because he hurt his shoulder yesterday, and the guys in the warehouse are off on weekends.  I understand, because I have a bad back.  I asked him to find someone else who could load it into my SUV.  After lowering the back row of seats in my vehicle, the box still wouldn't fit.  I asked if they could measure the out-of-box floor model so we would know if the dryer would fit.  I also said I was okay with them tying down the box with my rear gate partially open.  They asked if I had something to tie-down with, because they didn't.  I was surprised they didn't keep twine in the store for exactly this situation.  Costco has tied down large boxes for me on many occasions, so I just figured that this would be a common practice for an appliance store.   Rather than measure the floor model to see if it would fit in the back of my car, Louie and another employee decide to just load the actual floor model.  It fit fine,and they walked back into the store.  I went inside and asked them what we were waiting for, and Louie explained the dryer was in my car.  I was confused, because that was the floor model.  I asked him to load the new dryer, which I had purchased, into the car.  He said he couldn't open the box, because the warehouse was closed and he didn't have the tools.  I felt like I was being punked.  I asked him what tools he needed, and he explained he would needed box cutters and a wrench.  I said that they would probably be in the warehouse (doorway directly behind him), where he could borrow them.  He said the floor model had never been used and was the same thing.  I explained that I had a bad experience with the floor model in the past, and would like the new dryer that I had purchased.  I told him I would call my husband and see if he was okay with the floor model.    I went outside to sit in my vehicle with the air conditioning on while I called my husband.  At the same time, the other guy preceded to load the floor model out of the back of my car.  I rolled the window down and asked him if he was going to load the new dryer up, or if he needed me to come back with my sister's vehicle (something we had previously discussed).  He said with a smile, "Just forget it.  It's only a dryer and it isn't worth it.  We'd rather give you your money back."   I went inside to see Louie, who was already processing my refund as I approached the sales counter.  At this point there were four employees in the showroom.  Nobody seemed interested in helping me to buy a clothes dryer, or getting it loaded into my vehicle.  So we wasted 30 minutes of our Saturday afternoon, actually purchased a clothes dryer, yet came home without one.  I am still confused...it was an easy sale for them, the price was fair so there was zero attempt at haggling, but my business still wasn't "worth it" to this company.  So we four girls walked out of the showroom, and I have now placed the order online through a website that is $40 cheaper, and will deliver it to my house for free.    I am a real estate agent, and have actually recommended Mesa TV & Appliance to past customers who were buying a new home.  I'm not sure if any of them ever ended up buying there, but I can assure you that I will never mention this company in a positive way to anybody again.
