Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to in the greater Metro-Phx area.  The place has a old school look about it so look past the outdated decor and pink walls. Portion are just right. Prices were extremely reasonable considering the potions size you get. Services was excellent, timely, extremely courteous. Believe me, you will feel extremely satisfied when you leave.

This place is horrible! Figured I'd have a wonderful day with my kids and my wife to celebrate my birthday during our lunch hour.  Most of the entire place looks a if it has not been cleaned since they opened the place.  Zero sanitation.  Zero maintenance. The rubber/foam mats on the on the jungle gym floor were either displaced, uneven, or out right missing.  The padding of the equipment appeared to be worn in many places, loose, or again missing.  Overall, all of the equipment, rides, games, etc. hand a disgusting film which only means no one has never wiped anything down, ever .  What concerns me most is that we were there just after opening .    I work in the risk management/loss control industry and I'm wondering how this place has been overlooked for all of the many compliance issues regarding both Heath safety and for liability in this establishment.  Someone needs clean this place up or shut it down.
