A very friendly, true Frenchman. A very proud owner. Curbside appeal is non existent. The interior is inviting & charming. The pastry display is disappointing & a bit unkept, but makes up in true cultural flavor. Although only three stars, hoping to see this business supported.

An exceptional venue for the traditional bride or event planner at heart.   What a fabulous staff and quaint feel.   Great dining experience and room for a dance floor. The garden is lovely and perfect for photos.  Love this rustic establishment and what a gem for the surroundings of Phoenix!

Typical breakfast food, but good flavors, except for the orange juice--too sour. Stuffy service. Hard to find parking. Long wait, even out of season. But a good spot to enjoy for an early morning bite.

Sooooooo pinkin' cute! Yes, pinkin'.  What a blast from the past! Feels like you're right in the heart of the 1950's! Such a kick to enjoy a cute lil diner for a milkshake and basket of fries!

Great atmosphere. Delicious choices. Perfect pricing for the quality & quantity. Our waiter was super attentive & friendly. Minus one star for the vegetables being a bit cafeteria style.

5 Stars for the delicious food & flavors.   No stars for the tired, drab & dusty interior. Very disappointed. Needs a complete interior update overhaul and face lift.   The food is great quality, but their portions are monumental, and rather unappetizing with the amount of food on the plate--although this could be appealing to others of a unsophisticated palette.   Quite disappointed, but gracious that the quality of meat was outstanding.

I wasn't very pleased with the menu choices, and the flavors were either too much or too little of "something" .... but I must say, the service was stellar.

THE BEST steak fritte, mash potatoes, mac-n-cheese, Bearnaise reduction & french bread you will ever taste in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.  Fabulous service. Full wait staff, bow tie's and all!   Great ambiance.   Must make a reservation or you will expect a 2-3 hour wait.

I like this hotel!   Great pool of course...super fun!   It's very comfortable and upscale for the price point, and my girlfriends and I all seem to agree to stay here when we meet in Vegas...always a great time & comfortable stay!   Super budget friendly!

Not a big fan of the overall music. It was too trance/techno mix for me...not enough club "bump." However, I really liked our private table overlooking the waterfall...and great service.

Honestly, a MUST SEE.   The night view of all the lights on the strip was my favorite! lol, however, the pilot seemed to be about 12 years old, which caught us off guard. But we returned safe and sound, and had a ball!   SO adventurous, and awesome, it was soooo amazing and worth it!   A memory I'll never forget. :)

Besides the spa being a bad experience with their front desk staff ... The hotel itself is FAB!!!   Excellent, polished customer service from curbside in!   Clean, open spaced, clever modern design. I didn't realize it's actually only two floors. The larger building is privately owned.   Great pool...Awesome location...   5 stars!

For the price, this is a great option.   Clean, comfortable, modern, awesome location and fantastic guest services. Free wifi, decent gym.   I really love the outdoor fire pit & the menu at the restaurant has an outstanding selection.   **Warning!! A huge disappointment!! While traveling for business, where my sleep is imperative, I was quickly disturbed with the obnoxious volume and thumps coming from the adjacent night clubs. This was on a was even on a Tuesday night!! I can only imagine a weekend noise level! So intrusive. So upsetting. Can't stay here again because of this ;(

What a beautiful outdoor space to have dinner. You feel as if your in a private garden, accented with fire pits and teak furnishings. Best appreciated by candle & moon light! The flavors & assortment of their menu is exceptional. Their "coastal Italian" is true to culture. Incredible service.

Called to book their "midweek mojo" special upon my arrival at the hotel.   The staff over the phone were completely incompetent, impatient and rude!! I can't believe this personality type would work at a tranquil spa setting! Undercover bad attitudes!   The special was $60 for a 60 minute massage.   They said they only had 45 minutes available and it would be $95, OR "they would honor the $60 for 45 minutes."   Does this make any sense? This doesn't match the printed special.   They were very short with me as they were frustrated that I didn't conform to this solution. 45 minutes, and pay the same as the people that get 60 minutes? No. And then to throw other prices at me "$95.00, $125, 165." Not sure why these other prices were valid. I was very clear I was calling about the SPECIAL, they should have just said "I'm sorry, we don't have 60 minutes available in our scheduling, so I won't be able to accommodate the special."    The gal even hung up on me out of frustration after I told her "that's ok, it doesn't really make sense to me, that's not what the special says. Thank you though for your time." CLICK!!!! Not a thank you or a good bye! Terrible customer service.   Lets just pretend I was a complete jerk over the phone, don't ever treat someone in customer service this way. Terrible.   What a bad first impression I received when arriving to HVH.   You're mama's would be ashamed and I hope management teaches ya a lesson so you don't make this error again and cross the wrong person that'll give it right back atcha! God as my witness, I was very nice, just confused, and they sure did lose their patience with me. :(

White glove service from the moment you walk in the door. Exceptional treatment and quality. The professionalism of their service is phenomenal. From the waiting room crackers, cheese, and brownie bites, to the steam room after your massage or facial...SO delightful! A must experience!

It takes a lot for me to be blown away and to be convinced of true authenticity, but this award winning chef and restaurant nailed it!  Dim lighting, gothic, mid evil style chandeliers line the ceiling as you enter the dining room, and you have an immediate sense of the caliber of cuisine. We sat in the outdoor patio which was glowing with twinkling lights and white table cloths draped the tables. I also appreciated that there was plenty of air to keep you cool on a hot August desert night.   The true flavoring and fresh ingredients were so mouth watering and unique that it continued to impress at every bite. The smells, the textures, the surprise at every dish was truly an experience. Our table enjoyed a variety of entrees from the fresh mahi tacos, corn on the Cobb, kale salad, and of course grazed on some fresh, handmade table side guacamole!   Phenomenal existence of this restaurant, and I can truly say one of my favorite cuisine experiences!

Once again I feel as though fellow yelpers are peer pressured into following a five star trend. I'm not.   Honestly, sure, this breakfast spot is good...but did it blow my socks off? Not at all.   My scrambled eggs were not scrambled. They were more like fluffed, folded, and served on a plate. The waffle had a bit of a tree bark taste, less than sweet, and my toast was cold so the butter I spread didn't even melt.   However, our service was stellar, she was on it, (minus the smell of her smoke break that lingered as she passed by) I also really appreciated her splitting the checks each way for our large party of six.   Sure, it's good breakfast. But is it "omg amazing" and worth the long Saturday morning wait? No.

How cute is this doggy boutique! If I lived locally, I would absolutely leave my four legged son here for doggy daycare! What a clean, loving environment!   The owner is such a gem, and I really enjoyed shopping for my pooch! I ended up purchasing a cute lil dog treat dipped in pretty icing, and wrapped with love! My clients loved it!   Be sure to support this locally owned private establishment.   Can't wait to go back! In fact I plan on having them ship special doggy gifts to my clients and family over the holidays!

Yeah, sure, it's only two or three miles from the airport, and it's pretty clean, has some good amenities, but, I was disappointed.  You have to kinda drive through a shady area to get here, the walls are extremely thin, the beds are hard as a rock, the air conditioner sounds like a jet plane engine! Not to mention the toilet handle needs three muscle bound grown men to push down the handle!   I also think the breakfast should begin earlier than 6:30, as many of us business travelers are en route for the first flight out.   The good news? The front desk ladies were so charming and helpful and the hotel offers an airport shuttle every 30 minutes, every hour, on the hour.  Overall, expensive for what you get. Not impressed.

Such a sweet patio, so inviting, beautiful ambiance. Candlelit, garden setting. So perfect!   However, my meat was cold, and our waitor needed to take it down a notch. I'm all for friendly, but he was a bit overly animated and loud for the type of environment. We weren't at Chucky Cheese, we were at a quaint french bistro. Hello, turn down the volume. This critique is coming from someone who is often teased as "buddy the elf"...so if I thought it was over the top, it must have been!   Also appreciated that it was walking distance to our hotel.

I've stayed at FireSky, The W, Hotel Valley Ho...name it! Hands down, the rooms, and overall resort quality, is the best by far at Talking Stick Resort!   The rooms have floor to ceiling windows, sheltered by plantation shutters, complemented by extremely high ceilings, transitional furnishings, and perfection with its lighting throughout. The bathroom is large and welcoming, and I love it's contemporary vibe!   Fun casino, great restaurants, gorgeous golf course, fabulous pools...amazing choice for your Scottsdale stay!

Although it took forever to get our drinks, we were thrilled at the flavors of their freshly baked pizza!   The thin crust pepperoni was mouth watering and delicious!   Only down fall was the high sticker price for our table of six.   1 beer.  8 sodas. 6 individual pizza's...    $$$ 190 !!  $$$

Five stars for the AMAZING interior architecture and sexy ambiance! Negative stars for the taste of food and quality. My pasta sauce was sour in taste, and our desert was freezer burned. Our server was sweet and made a great effort to communicate in a seasoned, well versed manor, but overall a rookie at luxury service. The restaurant is so beautiful inside but lacks the quality in experience and flavors.

As a last minute decision, I eagerly booked a style appointment for an evening event I was hosting.   Celina Nunez greeted me, and all I had to say to her was "Texas hair. Give me big, bouncing curls!" She totally got it, and more than delivered!  Literally, I was in and out in less than 30 minutes and my hair was a dream! It looked so celebrity styled, and made me feel like a million bucks! I loved it!

But my review is for their stellar management and delivery service who continue to service me and my clients in a timely manner, and always aim to please!

A super healthy alternative to a greasy on the go lunch or dinner choice.   The selections are all fresh, healthy, generous in portion, value priced and high quality. The staff were full of smiles too, so that was great!  The pizza looks delish, but I chose to build my own salad. It was really tasty, and I'm glad I found this place!
