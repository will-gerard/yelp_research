When we arrived, it was PACKED...but we expected that on a Friday night at 630p. We considered going somewhere else, but I'm glad we didn't! Put our name in and were told it would be about 30 mins. 15 mins later, our name was called. Server was at our table within a minute and took our drink/appetizer order. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and by the time I came back, the appetizer was already on the table. We placed our dinner order and it also came out fast! I ordered the Royal Red burger with the fried egg....mmmmmmm! So good! My love got the cod fish and fries and said it was excellent! Our server was sooo attentive and quick. I wish I could remember her name. She had red hair and a friendly smile:-)

I've been going to Cucina Tagliani since they opened, 22 years ago and I have never had a bad experience. I had the Chicken Parmesan, despite the bad reviews on here and it was amazing! The portions are always very generous, enough to share. The bread is also very tasty. I've also had the Baked Spaghetti and the Tortellini with marinara. Both are excellent! After dinner, try the Mascarpone cake. You will not regret it!

I absolutely LOVE Mixteca! I have been going for years, even back when they were on 43rd Ave and Peoria. The breakfast burritos with some green sauce are BOMB! Another favorite is the #5 with shredded beef tacos! I love their chips and salsa too!!

I had high hopes since there were such good reviews on here, plus it was highly recommended by a few co-workers of mine. I was really disappointed...not only with the food, but with the service as well. It started with the way we were greeted...or shall I say, not greeted! There wasn't a hostess and multiple people saw us standing there waiting, but yet no one came over to seat us. Finally a guy came up and said "have you been helped?" Nope, hence why I'm still standing here waiting. He wasn't welcoming at all. Not much expression on his face and didn't really say much as he brought us to our table. He ended up being our server. He took our order and after telling him it was my first time eating there, he wasn't much help with the menu. They bring out complimentary bread, but our server forgot to bring us any until after our food was brought out. I could see if they were really busy, but it was after the lunch rush on a weekday and he brought the table next to us bread and they were seated after us! I ordered the Chicken Alfredo with veggies. It was honestly comparable to a frozen meal from the grocery store, even the chicken. My son ordered off the kids menu, Penne Alfredo, in which we added chicken. Then came the bill. I knew mine was $12.50, but my sons ended up costing about the same! $4.95 to add chicken to a kids meal that costs $5.00?!?! Maybe he should have said something! So we paid $30 for crappy food and crappy service. I don't think I will be returning.
