Amazing. So many companies don't understand how important it is for their customers to leave happy. Let me explain. It was Valentine's Day 2015.  They were packed. It is just my fiancee and I. We ordered burgers, some appetizers and drinks.  While we were waiting for our food our server accidentally spilled a bowl of cheese dip on the seat where my fiancee was sitting. It splattered all over the side of her nice purse. (Thank God she was in the restroom at the time). I covered the server and let her know I would make sure she doesn't find out. I felt pretty bad for her because she was sweet. I cleaned off her purse and it was like new. No harm no foul.  That was just the first incident of the evening.  We continued to wait an hour or so for just 2 burgers to come out. I'm sure you are thinking at this point I am crazy to still have this as a 5 star review. Keep reading.  Well finally our burgers come out.  Luckily we had some Artichoke dip and chips to hold us over until the burgers came out.  When the food finally came out the server told us she was so sorry and that the burgers were on them.  Nice gesture. I was pretty surprised. So many people have bad service at restaurants, but half the time I feel like its probably the customers demeanor to their servers.  My fiance and I are the type to be overly friendly to every server so everywhere we go it seems we have great service. Servers make mistakes. They are human. What matters is how they handle the situation after.  By the end of our evening we had ordered drinks, an appetizer, sides, burgers and a dessert. The bill was over $100.  The manager comes out and apologizes profusely for our experience. What he didn't know is that we weren't even mad. It was Valentine's Day so of course it's going to take a while for the food to come out.  When he came out he informed us that the entire bill is covered. Needless to say our server got a fat tip.  I have never seen such a thing before. What most businesses don't understand is that by him taking the financial hit he just ensured #1 me coming back in the future and #2 me giving this restaurant positive word out mouth. You can't put a price tag on that.  What also helped was the fact that their burger was one of the best I have ever had.  All of the rest of the food we got was delicious as well.  The ambiance and layout of the restaurant are amazing.  Everyone on the staff was friendly despite them having a hectic night.  I had a great experience and can't wait to come back.

Chips, salsa and bean dip here are to die for. The food at Serrano's has always been amazing at all locations. The staff is always friendly. The burritos are delicious and fairly priced. Make sure to get them enchilada style.

Coupons. Bring them. If you live in Chandler or Gilbert you should get them in the mail. If you don't then Google it. They can save you $10. That being said with a coupon this place is cheap for what you get. The portions are Small or Large. Don't get it twisted, small is not small. It is regular size for a average sized person.  I've never left hungry. Not to mention they stuff you with FREE bread before you food comes which is delicious.  Once the food comes out it is usually very hot and it always delicious. Yes, the service can sometimes be a little slow, but usually not for me because I am friends with a few people that have now served me many times. Treat people right and they will want to do the same for you.  Everyone is usually very friendly. This is one of my favorite places out there. I have never been disappointed yet. I can't think of any areas for opportunity so for that it must be 5 stars.

First and foremost, always use a coupon. If you live in Chandler they should come in the mail every other week. This will save you at least $12. Everyone here is friendly. The food has never disappointed and I've been here about 100 times. There are many good selection. The shredded beef taco is big and juicy. It tastes amazing. The burritos are decent but are a little bland. The Chimichanga is good, but is it worth the extra calories for being deep fried? That all depends on your metabolism. My new favorite choice here is the Mexican pizza. It is huge and filling. There are so many different flavors going on. The chips and salsa here are my favorite(tied with Serrano's that is). There is also a nice patio outside on a pond with a water fountain in the water that lights up at night. It looks pretty cool.

Dirty. Alright Valle Luna I feel like it is finally time to speak out. I am sick of defending this establishment to others. I've come here about 100 times over the past decade  and never once has the food ever been bad. Everything has always been tasty, but the lack of effort to keep your restaurant clean is unacceptable. This had to be why your restaurant was given a B rating. I always come here with my girlfriend and every time we come one thing is always guaranteed. That thing is that the plates and silverware on the table are always dirty. I'm not just talking every once in a while. I'm talking about every single time. We go out of our way every time we come to see if you guys finally learned how to clean. Unfortunately every time we are equally disappointed. Finally I came to the realization today while eating some of your food that if this is how your presentation is on the front end side I can only imagine the practices you have on the back end side. Immediately I dropped the food down on the table and felt sick to my stomach. This is completely unacceptable. This isn't a one time thing. This is an every time thing not just every once in a while. I will continue to pass along my message until this issue is fixed. Unfortunately the good food isn't going to be enough anymore to save my view on this restaurant. How hard can it be to clean your dishes?

I can't believe I used to work here when I was 16. I could never wrap my head around girl's clothing sizes so I just up and quit. Seems like turnover sucks here because I never see the same person here twice. Anyways.  This store usually has a good selection of clothes. I think the selection is much better than Ross. The store is usually clean and there aren't clothes lying around everywhere which is nice. Come here instead of Ross.

Don't judge a book by its cover. On the outside and even inside this restaurant isn't exactly aesthetically pleasing. The place was packed and people are everywhere. They have more tables then they know what to do with. Don't give up though the food ends up being worth it. The wait really wasn't that long for being a Friday night at dinner. Waiting is somewhat of a cluster though. You have people all over the place waiting. It was a cluster for sure. They should work on that. Once seated our waiter was friendly and accommodating. We all heard the pizza muffins were to die for and they lived up to that for sure. I wish I would have just eaten a bunch of those for dinner. They ended up being better than my main course. I wouldn't be surprised if you were full after those though. I ordered a pizza and it was decent, but nothing worth ordering again.  The people I was with ordered the calzones and absolutely loved them so next time I will have to get that. They seemed a little small for my hunger on a Friday night but not if you ordered the pizza muffins before. Overall this place was pretty good though. Definitely get a good amount of food for what you pay for. I will come back.

This place has some amazing food. The price is pretty high for what you are actually getting. Seems like mainly hipsters go here to hang out so I always take my food to go. The music played in the background by the band is annoying and overpowering. I couldn't even have a conservation with girlfriend when we went out here. To go is the way to go.

Your #1 stop for everything sports. They have almost every sports jersey and novelty item you can every think of all in one place. They have choices for every teams even crappy team like my Vikings right now :( There is not that many places around to find this much sports stuff all in one place.

The first thing that irked is the nickel and diming of the chips and salsa. Not cool. Ya I get it that everyone isn't a fatty like my girlfriend and I are when it comes to chips and salsa. That's fine. For the people who love chips and salsa like us though charging extra for more chips and salsa is BS. The main reason why it makes no sense is because they are the only restaurant doing that. The outside of the restaurant isn't very appealing but once you are in it isn't too bad. I was not a fan of the tables and how crammed they have you with everyone else in the restaurant. They have been around forever.  Invest in some booths. The food is what is giving this restaurant high reviews and I agree with that. The food was good. The different salsas and green chili were good. This restaurant has a lot of potential because of their food, but that's not enough to bring me back I'm afraid.

Garbage. No selection and feels pretty cramped. I was in and out of here within a few minutes. Stick with Foot Locker. The pricing is the same wherever you go in person so why go somewhere with barely any shoes. They don't use their space very well in this store.

Both times I've went here recalls to my vehicle made the work free and they were quick to let me know that. They didn't push any other service for me to get. They even did some extra work at no charge. The people who work there are friendly. The only reason I took away one star is because the turn around time was a few days. Also because when they called me they told me the car was ready I went there and it wasn't ready. I had to wait another 45 minutes before it was ready.

The Keg is a nice place to go to for an upscale dinner date. The restaurant is high class inside. The lighting is dim which I like but I know some people don't. The booths and tables are big so you feel very comfortable. The bread they give you is soft and tastes great while you wait. I got a hamburger and I was very impressed how good it was. They have good fries as well. The price isn't that much higher than other places that aren't as upscale.

Liberty has the best service out of any restaurant I've ever been to. They pride themselves on it unlike Joes BBQ across street. All the employees always have a smile on their faces. Now that we are regulars they remember what we get every time and are always very accommodating. I can't understand why some restaurants don't value the impact of good service. I think Joes BBQ service sucks because they know they are the best and you will still come regardless(which I do unfortunately). The food at Liberty is always on point. It's always consistent. The environment is good. Even when it's busy it a nice place to eat at. I always get a burger and it is one of the best burgers I've ever had. We get oven fries which is amazing as well as the potato salad. For dessert the rice pudding is always a good choice. Their cookies are amazing too. All and all everything is perfect. This is one of the most well run restaurants in Arizona.

The food here is great if you know what you're doing. I've been here many times and it took multiple times for me to figure out what flavors taste good and ones that aren't as good. Luckily they have a sign for your novices to follow on how to make your food. The staff is friendly and willing to help you if you need it. The portion is huge if you know how to pack your bowl down. Jump on that bad boy like a suitcase you are trying to pack tight. Don't be shy. For the amount of food you get plus a drink the price is fair. They normally charge 50¢ for a to go box but they've never charged me before. Depends on if they like you I guess. Just be friendly.

The food is too expensive. The portions aren't very good for the price. Across the street is Panda Express which is about the same amount of food, cheaper and has a drive-thru. The gentleman at the front counter that takes orders at the register had a cup in his hand taking a sip of his drink while taking my order. Then he proceeded to say hello to a customer I assume is a regular and threw something at him. It was all very unprofessional to say the least all while taking my order. Needless to say I won't be coming back.

WORST LOCATION IN ARIZONA. I love Panda Express and have always had great experiences at every other location. However this location is by far the worst I've ever been to. Many people I know feel the same. The restaurant is clean and the service is sufficient, but the food is very rarely fresh. Obviously you can ask them to make a fresh batch just for you, but this will require you to wait an extra ten minutes. At that point it may not be considered "fast food".

It is true what they say about the nachos. They are quite delicious.  This is probably this best bar restaurant in Arizona. They have a lot of food options and they are all good I hear. They are a Vikings restaurant too so bonus points for that. Go Vikings! Everyone is very friendly. Parking is kind of a bitch, but whatever it is worth it. TVs everywhere is nice too.

Every time I come to this location the food is perfect. The burgers are so juicy and cooked to perfection. They have a condiments bar with fresh vegetables. The fries are my favorite of all time. They have the new soda fountain machines that are touch screen and let you create a custom soda. The price is a little higher then most but you get what you pay for. I can't think of a reason to take away a star.

This place has the best croissants I've ever eaten. They are a bit pricey but what do you expect with such a high quality product. Every flavor I've ever had tastes great and they melt in your mouth. They have a neat labeling system so that you can tell which flavor is which when you get a big box of them.

I love Chase Field. It is one of the more family friendly stadiums out there unless we are playing the Dodgers that is. I've been to many games and every seat I've sat in here is good unless you come to a 5pm game and sit along 1st baseline. In that case you better bring some sunglasses for a few innings. Tickets are pretty cheap and there are many food options even for people who are trying to eat for cheap. Parking is a pretty goal deal as well and it is pretty easy to find parking up close. The best bang for your buck seats are along first baseline on the second level a little bit past first base. Just make sure you go to the 7pm games. On the weekdays usually every month there are good promotions such as bobbleheads which is pretty cool. I always had a good time here.

I had my engagement night dinner here so it will always have a special place in my heart. The patio is the highlight of the restaurant. Not a big fan of the indoor seating because it is pretty cramped. I would have sat outside but it was a July night we went here so it was hot not to mention I was in a full suit after proposing.  Parking was a bitch. The food is really good. Their pizza is very delicious. Our server was very nice and accommodating.  Not a big fan of giving me a soda in a can and still charging me $3 per can lol. I don't know why some places do that. This isn't Mexico. Get a damn fountain.  I would go back.

No bueno. The food here was not that good and the options were limited. I ordered something and they were out of it which forced me to eat something I didn't want. The bruschetta was pretty good but not worth the price. Only came here for the coupon and won't come back. The place seem a little dirty.

Their pizza is top notch. The store they have attached to the restaurant is pretty neat as well. I would have given them 5 stars, but the server was a B to my fiance.  They don't have bread or anything while you wait. Luckily the good pizza made it worth it. I would go back.

This stadium is beautiful. It looks like an alien spaceship, but I like it. I would give it 5 stars, but the parking sucks most of the time. The stadium has good food options. Every seat I've ever sat in at different levels seems like a good seat. The staff is really friendly. Go Cardinals!

Wow this location is super busy. This is especially true at lunch time. I love that they have someone outside taking orders so that you can breeze through the drive thru even when the line is ten cars deep. They do a good job keeping it clean. The food is always amazing and never disappoints. I will come back very often.

Busy. Oreganos is always busy. People are still coming in 5 minutes to close. It is in a great location in downtown Gilbert which is my favorite area to eat at.  The service is pretty good. I love those big cups they have. For someone like me who always needs refills it cuts down on that quite a bit. (Protip: ask to take a cup home. They had no problem with it, surprisingly) You have to get the Garlic bread. It is huge and tastes amazing. Deep dish pizza is where it's at. Sure it takes 45 minutes they say for the pizza to be ready, but shoot enjoy your company for a bit. What is the rush? There pizza is so good. I could care less about the price. Their sauce is so flavorful and their sausage is high quality. Desserts here are amazing. You have to try them at least once.

So many memories at this place. I have been coming here since I was a little kid. The staff has always been friendly. Serrano's has always had top tier quality bean dip and salsa to go along with their chips. Few restaurant rival them in that area. I know plenty of people who come here just for the chips and salsa so that should tell you something about how good they are. The food on the other hand is fairly average. The price for their food is pretty fair and a little on the lower side.  This location is right in the heart of downtown Chandler.

The 'Burrito Especial' is amazing and better then all the competitors such as Chipotle and Qdoba. You don't have to worry about grizzly steak like you do at the competitors. The salsa bar is amazing and has great choices. The price is competitive with the other competitors

I love Sports Authority. They have pretty much everything you can think of here sports related. You have to make sure you sign up for the League which is a loyalty program that gets you money back. They always send coupons in the mail so you can almost always get a discount here. They staff is friendly and helpful. I always have a good experience here.

Well, Costco is amazing. We all know that. This location has a selection of items that other locations don't. I get gas here once a week and it's always the cheapest. The employees are what make this company great. Unfortunately they didn't realize I would be a good piece of the company when I was there, but it is still the best place I've ever worked for.  Everyone there is very friendly and I've never had one bad experience there. They are good with returns as most people know. You shouldn't take advantage of it though. The food court is delicious and always hits the spot. Check out the AMEX card. It will get you a lot of money back if you are a Costco regular like me. The executive membership plus AMEX pay for themselves by the end of the year. Just head over to the membership counter and they will help you out.

I've never been to another race track other than here and Indianapolis Motor Speedway so it's hard to know what makes nice racetrack. What's nice is that it's kind of oval so it's easy to get around the whole track pretty quickly. They always have a lot of fun things for kids and adults to do outside of the track to keep you busy when you are waiting for the race to start. The box seats here are really nice and enclosed which is nice especially on a hot day. The food service in the box seats is very good. Parking is kind of a pain in the ass if you don't have VIP parking. I highly recommend you find a way to get the parking that's next to the stadium or else you will be walking from across the street. If you plan on indulging in some snacks at the race than maybe it's a good idea you get some exercise and take the long way.

Pizza is good here. I can see why some people like the garlic knots and some don't. These knots are literally GARLIC knots. They are plastered in garlic so if you dont like that I would ask for them without the garlic. Luckily for me I love garlic so I wasn't complaining. Plus you can't really complain because they were free. The service here is good and the location is nice inside. They weren't very busy on a weeknight so the pizza came out quick. I would go back for sure.

NYPD has my favorite pizza out there. It is a little pricey but so is most other places. It is totally worth it. Always make sure you get garlic knots. They are cheap and filling. They come with marinara to dip in that is sweet and tastes amazing. The calzones here are very big and tasty as well. I highly recommend their food. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They have good dessert choices as well.  The restaurant is clean.

The good was decent but the staff didn't seem very friendly here. They really like to nickel and dime you here for everything it seems like. It was clean at least. They don't really offer anything that would make me want to come back. Go down the street a block to Los Taquitos instead.

The location is great. It is right in the heart of downtown Chandler. The restaurant had open seating and every seat had a TV playing sports which is always a bonus. The service was decent, but could have been better. The nachos here were huge and to die for. They cost more than an average restaurant though. I believe they were meant for more than one person. Everyone was very friendly.

Forefathers is great. It's the best cheesesteak I've had in Arizona so far. I haven't tried many but best so far. The small sized one should be filling enough for most people.

I have to say I frequent this location once a week and for years I've never had one issue. The food is amazing. I originally was going to give 5 stars until they increased the prices. For that they only get 4 stars.  Pro-tip: Go inside and get a burrito punch card so that you can get a free burrito after buying a few.

This place is amazing. I had both the apple cinnamon and pumpkin spice ice cream in a waffle cone. The ice cream was the best I've ever had. I believe what makes it so good is the texture their ice cream has. It is something I haven't noticed from other ice cream shops. The cone to me was great but other people I was with thought it was a little sweet.  The price was average which was great considering the high quality of the ice cream. The staff seemed friendly. I have no complaints.

Boy does this place suck. I am feeling good today so I will avoid giving a one star review. The food here is hit or miss. They totally jipped me on food portions. If I'm going to freakin pay this much for fast food Chinese food at least give me a decent portion. The only thing this place is good for is getting forks and spoons to put in my desk because my work believes in "going green." This includes not providing utensils in the break room.

Think Joyride minus the hipsters. First thing you notice when coming in is the nice layout. Whether you like sitting inside or outside, they have it all.  It is a pretty big restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. Their menu has many options. The burritos here are good. The staff is friendly. They have lots of big TVs which is something I appreciate in a restaurant. Joyride has better food but this place has a better restaurant. If only they could take the best of both. I would go back.

Thank you Costco for the gift cards. I LOVE Grimaldis. Great location for a restaurant. Not exactly my favorite layout for a restaurant, but when you taste the pizza you will not care. They have a bar that goes to outside and a patio which is nice. The servers have all always been really friendly. The service is always fast. They don't rather have a lot of choices for food here for people that may not like pizza, but as long as you do you are good to go. I usually will choose deep dish or Neapolitan pizza as my choices for go to pizza, but if you are feeling like NY style pizza it's either here or NYPD across the street. To me those are the best NY Style pizza places in AZ.  Grimaldis pizza really the best for this style. Every bite is so flavorful and addicting. It makes it difficult to stop eating it. It is a little pricey, but is completely worth it. I will continue to go back time and time again.

I can't even think of one bad thing to say about this place. Everyone is really friendly. Major hipster vibe. The service was fast and they fill you up with amazing bread while you wait. (You can buy a loaf to take home) The food is absolutely on point. There are many options and every one of them looks delicious. The desserts are amazing. Not really feeling the church pew seating but its easy to overlook when everything else is perfect.

Baci is more of an upscale Italian food restaurant. It is a family restaurant. Everyone there is very friendly and provide good service. I would say dress at least business casual here because it is a nicer restaurant.  The food is really high quality and you do pay the price for that. The environment is very quaint and it is a great place to take a date. There are TVs all over the place so you don't miss the game which is nice.  I highly recommend Baci.

I can't believe it took me so long to review this place. The pizza here is ON POINT. The only better pizza in my opinion is Pomo. This place is so close to being #1 in the state but Pomo still barely takes the cake. I'd like to think I'm a little bit of a pizza connoisseur at this point. Yes, I had to look up how to spell that. The dessert was delicious as well. Pay attention because you may miss this place. It is hard to find on the side of the street but it doesn't matter. This place can easily survive off of word of mouth solely. I just wish it wasn't so far from where I live. They definitely should expand locations like Pomo. The ambiance is great. It is a little darker and quiet which is nice. The servers are friendly and seem passionate about their job. The prices are in line with all of their competitors. I would highly recommend trying this place. I will definitely be coming back.

This place has some of the highest quality meat I've ever had on a sandwich. They are competitively priced. Their bread is delicious. They have the touch screen soda fountain that lets you make custom drinks. They have TVs on ESPN usually which is a bonus for someone who likes sports. The staff seems friendly. Why go to subway and pay the same price for an inferior sandwich?

Red Robin is open later than their competitors which is a bonus for people like me who eat late. The bottomless fries are amazing. You have to try a chili burger. Their chili is delicious and mixed with onions. The prices are comparable to their competitors. The service was decent but could have been better. It could have been because I was the last person in the restaurant at night but still.  I will be coming back many times in the future.

Babbo is a very nice restaurant. The setup inside is ideal. There are many booths. They have a bar. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious. They have some of the best complimentary bread I've ever had at a restaurant. The portions are pretty large for the price. They have lots of food and pizza options. They usually aren't super busy so you should never have to wait to get in.

Best fries and healthiest hamburger. No need for the cheese. The spread tastes amazing.

Jump Street is a fun place to take kids and even for adults. I was surprised how quickly you get tired. I'm in shape and I pretty tired after an hour of jumping. It wears you out quick. The dodgeball area is fun for everyone. There is plenty of room for people to jump even when the place is busy. Don't get too much time like I did or else you will be sitting there after an hour.

I really wish I had been coming here all these years. I'm mad I only recently started coming back a year ago. This place is truly great. Such a huge restaurant and yet always so packed. That tells you something.  I love the ambience and the homely feel you get when you are here. They have a beautiful patio if you like sitting outside too.  Everyone here I come into contact with if very nice and friendly. Gary is our main dude though. Their bread and oil/herbs are to die for. So soft and warm. It just melts in your mouth. They might just have the best bread for an Italian food restaurant. Once you are done tearing up your bread your food comes and you are already full from eating so much bread. Their portions are YUGEEEE! I am always taking some to go. I love their. Penne Rosa w/ Sausage is my go to. No mushrooms though. It doesn't need them anyways. It is still crazy flavorful w/o them. I love coming here weekly. My jeans aren't as happy though. If you haven't come here yet you must. You will love it.

Yogurtland has good flavors usually. The location is clean and the staff is friendly.  I definitely recommend signing up for the Yogurtland card/application. After multiple visits you can earn points to receive free ice cream.

Unless you are in the area I don't think this place is worth the drive. Don't get me wrong the food was good, but you have to park and find your way the restaurant while you walk through the resort area. Relish wasn't busy like I expected it would be. It is just a little resort restaurant over the golf course. Tater tots were on point and the burger was very good. This place is a once in a lifetime place. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again though.

Massive park. It is has fields to play sports such as soccer and football. There are basketball courts as well. There is a huge pond which is nice. There is parking around 75% of the park, but it can be a mad house when flag football is being played.

I love coming here to check out the latest and greatest technology. They hate it but I love showrooming this place to go buy online cheaper later. You don't have to do that anymore though because they price match online retailers. I came to pick up an online order and both times I've done this it has taken them 15 minutes to get me my product I ordered to the store that is literally right behind the person trying to find it. Don't email me and tell me you are ready for me to pick up my item and then keep me there that long. Your system is broken. Fix it. They have a monopoly over any other electronics stores. I know they are making money.

It's depressing this restaurant has just closed. I barely just got into going here a few months ago and they go and close without running it by me first. Unacceptable. I like this place because first from the moment you walk in it seems very authentic looking. I love that when I choose a Mexican restaurant to go to. Once sat we were given chips and a couple salsas both of which were very tasty. The server was very attentive and friendly. They served very large portions here which I love because I love having leftovers. I got a shredded beef burrito which was delicious. Their shredded beef if very high quality and flavorful. It was juicy. The service was fast. Overall everything here was great both times I went. Unfortunately I won't be able to go ever again.

The food here was a little pricey for the lack of flavor it had. The server screwed up and was supposed to remove the order that was messed up on my friends bill. The service was not up to par. I've had much better pizza elsewhere and won't be coming back here. There was a reason they weren't very busy on a Friday night I'm sure.

The cupcakes here are amazing! Ya, they may cost more than the grocery store but try are totally worth it.  They have many delectable options that will satisfy any palette. The more you get the cheaper they are.

They don't have a lot of choices for ice cream but the ones they do have are amazing. Very flavorful at a reasonable price. This place gets very busy and you will be waiting in a line on the street most likely. The staff was friendly.

This place gets you in and out quick.  The bagels are very soft and they had many choices to choose from. The prices were pretty good for what you get.  They wrap it in tin foil which is nice when getting to-go. I ate my bagel sandwich 30 minutes later and it was still hot.  The Bagel Man is friendly. I don't understand why are there so many haters. Maybe people need to be more friendly and he will reciprocate.  The cook was very nice and accommodating. I have to give this place a 5 star review based on my experience which was perfect.  I suggest giving it a try once at least. Hopefully you catch the Bagel Man on a good day like I did apparently.

Service was terrible. The server was nice, but not very efficient. If you want a better alternative to this same style of food try out YC's. Genghis Grill not only doesn't taste as good as YC's, but the portions are smaller and you are required to have a server you must tip. Overall YC's is the better bang for your buck and tastes quite a bit better.

The atmosphere is very elegant. You are able to sit outside or inside. Outside has a bocce green which is actually pretty fun. The food was very different and the selection is very minimal. It was pretty delicious but since there is only a small selection of food some people may not be able to find something they like. This is a rare 4 star review when the food for one reason or another isn't up to my standard. The scenery was that stunning though so I couldn't give lower than 4 stars. Check the menu before you decide to come here to make sure there is something you like.

Small and quaint...until we got there that is. This restaurant is tiny.  There are about five tables inside. Somehow that was enough for us because they weren't busy at 8pm on a Friday. There are only a few choices of pizzas that they offer. The choices are good ones though. There is amazing free bread while you wait that is warm and soft. The pizzas are big and more than enough for the average person. The desserts were very delicious as well. I know this is a small complaint but the sodas are disgusting. They don't have Pepsi or Coke products just these custom cane sugar drinks. No bueno. The owner talked with us half of the time we were there. He is a cool guy. Just don't ever ask him for ranch, ham or pineapple for your pizza. It offends him rightfully so because his pizzas are pretty good. The service was okay but the server rarely came around. We didn't get our check until 30 minutes after we were done.

Meh. I get the novelty of the place, but it just wasn't for me. I would say a little overpriced, but location location location. I would charge the same for that area. People will pay it so why not charge it. We are outside and it was a nice atmosphere, but that wasn't enough for me. I had a brat and it was decent, but to be honest I've had better that I've made myself. The hamburger order was wrong that they brought me the first time. They brought me the right burger and it was decent, but not worth the price tag. Their garlic fries on the other hand were pretty delicious.

Aesthetically this is the most beautiful Mexican food restaurant I've ever been to. It is very quaint on the inside. It is definitely a good date restaurant. The server was very friendly. The chips and salsa were pretty good. I got the shredded beef burrito. Most Mexican food restaurants don't do shredded beef right. Most of the time it is overcooked and dry. Their shredded beef was not as dry but still seemed a bit overcooked. The food presentation was nice. The beans were good. The rice was okay. The portions were pretty normal. The dessert was amazing. They have sopapillas and churros. If someone asked me about going to this restaurant I would recommend giving it a shot.

I love most of Upward Projects group of restaurants. This is one of them. The prices here are pretty fair and are about the same as all their competitors. I just got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. They use high quality ingredients in their pizza so you can tell when you take a bite how amazing each ingredient is on its own. The place is always poppin' it seems like. The layout of the restaurant is interesting, but fun. I enjoyed myself while here. They get pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait. The server was friendly and accommodating. You won't regret coming here and check out other Upward Projects restaurants while you are at it. They have some great ones!

Good price. Very quaint. Beautiful inside. Good chips and salsa. Good portions. Not a big fan of the burritos though. I have been here multiple times since my first review and I get their chimichangas. They are amazing. Usually I get ground beef which seems to be the most tasty option. Make sure to get beans and rice on the side.

Pretty good selection of clothes here. They have a better women's collection of clothes I believe. I prefer TJ Maxx for guys clothes. The lady at the register was very rude to a lady in front of me and it bothered me. I understand you work at Ross and hate your life, but chill out at least you have a job.

This restaurant is a very good date spot. The restaurant is dim lit which makes for a romantic ambiance. They had a musician playing and the music surprisingly wasn't disruptive. The appetizer which was bread was delicious and filling for two people.  Their pasta dishes have great presentation and taste equally as great. our server was friendly and so was the front desk. They are also ahead of the technology here. They have a system you sign into to earn points per visits. I highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back.

This Coach outlet is awesome. Well mainly for girls, but there are some products for men here as well. Almost everything in the store is very affordable. On top of everything being at a good discounted price they also almost always have a sale on top of that. Also if you are on your mailing list you can get a coupon mailed to you that you can use as well. What's cool is that they let you stack coupons here. Guys take your woman here when you want to get them a gift. You can get a lot for your money and they will leave smiling. When mama is happy everyone is happy.

It is very rare for me to give a five but wow. This place is amazing. It started from the moment we walked in the door.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  The environment was perfect. The music was loud but for some reason I didn't feel like it was overpowering. I was able to hold a conversation without having to speak loud.  You wouldn't think music in the background is important, but the music was hip to the times. The lights were very dim but that made for a romantic atmosphere.  The chips and salsa were delicious. Before the food even came I already had a 5 star review waiting to give them as long as the food was up to far with the rest of the experience.  The waitress was very friendly.  When the food came out it was the best food presentation I have ever seen especially for the price of the food.  It was as if you saw the commercial for food and it actually looked the way it was shown on TV which we all know is very rare.  The burrito was huge. The "Beast" burrito was packed full of steak along with fresh cut avocado. It also had pico de gallo and beans inside. It was very filling.  The chicken and carne asada tacos were amazing as well.  Once finished with the main course we had to top it off with some churros.  I couldn't find one thing wrong with this restaurant and I would highly recommend giving it a shot.  I will now be a regular from here on out.

Whether it is a burrito, taco or nachos everything served at Joyride is delicious and is made with the highest quality ingredients. Did I mention it is at an affordable price as well? It's been a 5 star experience all three times I've been here.

I was a little skeptical about this restaurant at first. I hadn't heard much about it before going for the first time. After spending an evening dining here I am surprised I haven't heard more about this restaurant. First off the staff because they were incredible. We had the same waiter both times we have come here. He was very friendly and personable. He always made sure we were stocked up on soda as well as chips and salsa. We spoke with the owner for literally about 30 minutes about how he wants to make this restaurant great. He spoke about how the customer is always right and how he wanted to make sure everyone is always happy with service. He is open to feedback and encourages it. When you receive chips and salsa they give you three salsas which are all unique. The food came out timely and was delicious. The portions were perfect. You definitely get what you pay for. They have a tequila club where you can try 100s of different types of shots and give you your own glass that you can grab every time you come in. The bar is pretty big. Both the bar and restaurant are aesthetically pleasing.  I highly recommend giving this restaurant a shot.

This place is quite different than anywhere else I've been before. That being said it is a good thing. It seems they can get quite busy at dinner time. I didn't have to really worry about that around 8:30pm on a Friday though. The outside of the restaurant looks really great and so does the inside. You order at a register and take a seat while you wait for your food. The burger is above average and you can definitely distinguish their burgers from ones that aren't as organic their burger is. The garlic fries are to die for and I suggest getting them. The soda drinks they offer were a little odd but made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. They had diet coke though for those who like that. The people were very friendly and dinner was enjoyable. There are TVs all over the place playing sports so that was a bonus for me. I would go here again.

This park has a lot going for it. It has a baseball field. It has a basketball court. It has a pretty nice walking trail which is also good for riding my bike on. It has an area for picnics and outdoor parties. There is a play set for little kids too.

Ingredients. La Piazza PHX has the best ingredients over any other competitor. First we started off with Angioletti Fritti and the Foccacia. Both were delicious. For the main course we ordered Lasagne Ah' Pizz. The tomatoes really stood out. Ricotta is my favorite ingredient to add to a pizza, but even the tomatoes stood out over the ricotta. They were definitely imported tomatoes. We are talking DOP standards here. Nothing but the best.  The restaurant is small so you might miss it. You will not want to attempt to park in a parking garage like we did. Instead they have parking right in front of the restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and made some good food suggestions.  I am not a big fan of soda in a glass bottle at restaurants because 99% of the time it is and has been expired for a while which makes it tasteless. I would definitely go back and would strongly suggest over Pizzeria Bianco. It is much easier to get into, tastes better and isn't cramped inside like PB.

This Walmart is new so obviously is in clean and looks immaculate in comparison to neighboring Walmarts. For people who like to night shop it is a welcome change coming here and not having to deal with stockers in your way in every aisle. This Walmart basically sells everything the big Walmarts sell except electronics, home goods and clothes. The staff seemed friendly enough for working at midnight. I will come here over the big Walmarts for now on for food.

Pomo! This is my spot right here. Lisa and I love going here. Their pizza is on point. I think they have the best non-Chicago style pizza in Arizona. Forget Pizzeria Bianco. This place is the best. Trust me. Pomo is very spacious. Their ingredients are the best I have had in Arizona. The staff is very friendly and the service is always impeccable.  They have a store there which sells olive oil and balsamic which if you know me is my fav. I would like to think I am an aficionado when it comes those. If you order bread you get to try their olive oil and balsamic that they sell there. It is the best I have ever had.  Their dessert is amazing as well. Their bread pudding is top notch.  I have tried various food items here and they are all good. They have a nice patio as well.  Pomo is a good date spot. I can hardly wait for them to open the new location in Gilbert.  Check Pomo out. You won't be disappointed.

It took 15 minutes to get through the drive-thru with two lanes. There can't be that many people eating lunch at 1:45pm to make this line seem as long as it was. I got the snack wrap for $1.59 and it was small and not that good. Yes I know, for a dollar menu item that's what I should expect but it isn't. This is because Wendy's across the street has a snack wrap for the same price and twice the size not to mention twice the flavor. Who knows maybe it was because this is such a new McDonalds and everyone wants to go here.

Good food. Few choices. This restaurant seems more like a Tex-mex type of restaurant. No burritos or chimis which is disappointing. Their bean dip is one of the best I've ever had. The enchiladas were delicious. The restaurant is really tiny and only has a few seats. It was more of a one time place for me. Nothing really stood out as being amazing that would make me want to ever come back.

This Forever 21 is better in every way then the Chandler location in the mall. Both locations have good selection for women, but this location excels is customer service. Everyone here is very friendly when at the Chandler location everyone is miserable and acts inconvenienced when you ask for help. The parking is close. You can actually get cell phone service in this location where Chandler you can't. Clothes are pretty cheaply made, but you already know that if you have shopped here before. You get what you pay for.

Decent. Nothing special to see here. I don't know if the TV menu was just not turned on or what, but it seemed kind of dumb to have you walk right up to the register as soon as you walk in not sure how to order.  The cashier just says grab a menu and look through it then order.  Mind you there was a TV behind her not even on. I assume that is normally the menu.  Now onto the food. The burger was above average. The fries were tasty. I tried the sweet potato fries and the regular ones. I liked both. I really enjoyed it. The presentation was great.  The price was a little high for what it actually is. Personally I would much rather go to In-n-out and pig out for more than half the price, forget the presentation.  My fiance had a shake and she said it was really good. Overall it was a decent experience. At least the food was good and came out quick. I am not sure if this place will last though.

I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I ordered the bean dip to start with the chips and salsa. It was delicious. The chips and salsa were OK but not that good.  I ordered the nachos. When they came out they were huge.  They were filling and tasty.  The server we had was awesome. He was running back and forth to make sure we always had everything we needed.  Needless to say we tipped him well.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great because it is kind of inside, but no walls so you can see outside.  The have a DJ every day.  I feel bad because they are in the infamous cursed location of Chandler Mall.  No place ever lasts there. I can't say I for sure would eat here again without the Living Social deal I got for this restaurant. It is a little pricey.  The Nachos are definitely worth the money, but from what I can see on the Yelp pictures it looks like everything else may be a little overpriced.

Worth the wait. I was hoping that would be the case while sitting in line for almost two hours. Thank god that ended up being the case. I didn't appreciate being told it would be 45 minutes and actually end up being an hour and a half. It didn't help I was dying of starvation from not eating all day and it being 10:30pm. I am not about judging a restaurant based on the wait times. They can't help they are this in demand. Once we sat down our waitress was very nice and thanked us for waiting so long. Luckily they give you an option while waiting in line to preorder your pizza so that they have it to your table within 15 minutes of sitting down. Normally deep dish pizza can be up to a 45 minute wait. We ordered an appetizer (3 cheese bread). It was delicious. It comes with some marinara which was good too. By the time we finish the appetizer the pizza arrives. One bite in and I am overcome with relief that the pizza was by far and away worth the wait. The ingredients are amazing. The crust was probably one of the best parts. Some deep dish crust gets a little soggy. Not here. There crust was like a pie crust in how in was dry and how it broke apart as you bite into it. The tomatoes are big standouts when you take a bite. You can tell they use the best ingredients. I got sausage, pepperoni and onions. I love their sausage. My mouth is just bursting with flavor from every direction with all these delectable ingredients. I love the way the restaurant is set up. It is pretty cool looking with a bar in a separate room, the check in in a separate room and the dining room in a separate room as well. The dining room is filling with multiple huge TVs playing all Chicago games that may be on TV at the time. The whole dining room set up looks really nice. Everyone was friendly, especially our server. Food comes out fast. When you come to a restaurant like this you shouldn't really consider the cost. You are about to devour an American treasure. Luckily the cost was very fair and comparable, despite the demand. They have a gorgeous patio too if you don't want to dine inside. I am glad I made the drive from Chandler to come here. No regrets. Maybe just wait a few weeks for it to hopefully die down a little bit. Everyone wants to come now so unless you like a wait maybe hold off a bit.

I was a big unsure about the decision to make a pizza place like this in this area and after attending I this I feel even more the same. Neapolitan pizza might be one of my favorite types of pizza and there's was pretty good, but pretty unmemorable. The house bread was decent, but nothing special. The place was pretty dead for a Friday. I figure it might be due to the location, but I guess I don't know for sure. The restaurant has a nice setup and everything. They have the oven out for everyone to watch if interested. Our server was friendly but a little crazy. She literally tried to up-sell on everything we tried to order. She almost forced us to go with one of her suggestions also which was pretty annoying after the 5th time. The price was pretty normal for those type of pizza places. The food was good, but the overall experience was not enough to make me want to go back when I can go to Pomo down the street for a much better overall experience.
