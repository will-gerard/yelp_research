I really dislike this location because of the customer service but because I was in the area and needed to buy a birthday present I stopped by. Their shelves are never stocked and they're consistently out of products advertised. I wanted a NYX lip gift set but of course there weren't any left on the shelf. I searched for an associate to help but no one was to be found. I settled on another gift set. Then I picked out two OPI nail polishes, advertised at 2 for $16 with a free infinity scarf. When I got to the register I decided to ask about the NYX gift set I originally wanted. They basically did not want to be bothered. The girls behind the register looked at each other and said, "yeah, no we're all out." Then I asked for the scarf and the response was another, "we don't have those anymore. The free gifts always go fast." I tried to look for their $3.50 off coupon in my email and couldn't find it. I know they usually have an extra copy behind the register but she wouldn't help me. I didn't end up buying anything because I was so frustrated. I went to Beauty Brands down the street instead to buy the gifts. Their shelves are always full, they have the products as advertised, they take all coupons (even competitors), and they have wonderful customer service. So over Ulta! I'll take my business elsewhere...

I had a friend in town from San Fransisco who enjoys well crafted cocktails. He ordered an old fashioned but it wasn't to his standards so he sent it back. The bartender came to our table to notify us that it was a $15 drink and that he would take it off the check this time but to watch it. I was blown away! Perhaps he is not used to having his cocktails sent back because the crowd was highly intoxicated by 8pm and they had no idea what they were drinking. I spoke to the manager about our experience and he clearly did not care. The staff was very unprofessional... Some of the worst service I've experienced. I will not be returning.

Returned for a graduation party and they're still awful. The front door man wasn't standing at the door so I let myself in. But he ran over to make sure I paid the $5 cover charge, even though we had a table and large party... Seated away from the live band (couldn't even see them), tucked away in a corner. The waitress had a dull personality and knew nothing about the menu. I asked for wine recommendations and she said the menu changed so she didn't know what was available. Their Tuscany flatbread was surprisingly decent. They can have a star for that.

Valle Luna is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is always good and you can't beat it! Their chunky salsa and chips are the best. I like their melon margarita and vegetarian fundido. I've been going here since I was a little girl. Birthdays here are a tradition. Try their Mexican ice cream or flan. Everything is delicious.

I have had several poor experiences at this location. I have been a loyal customer for years but I will never return to this location. I received a nail polish as a gift and I didn't care for the color. I went in to exchange it for another color and purchase Christmas presents. The woman I spoke to would not do the even exchange because I didn't have a receipt. She told me they had no way to look it up without the receipt which is ridiculous because it was in it's original condition and in the box with the sku. She told me I would have to call customer service and ship it to them in order to do the exchange. Seems very silly for a $12 nail polish... So I declined and spent $100 on Christmas presents. She was not helpful at all. Frustrated, I spoke to the MAC associates at Nordstrom. They said I should go back and request to speak to a manager because it's their product and they should be able to do the exchange. So I went back and the manager was equally unhelpful. She said they couldn't even scan the product which I still can't believe. I decided to return the $100 worth of gifts I purchased in case any of the recipients wanted to exchange the products. I asked for a customer service card and she replied, "I'll circle it on the bottom of the receipt for you." I went back to MAC Nordstrom and they exchanged the nail polish without even having their proof of purchase sticker. They scanned the sku because it's MAC's universal product (all comes from the same place). I guess the girls at the flagship store didn't want to bother. Worst customer service ever!!! And if you're buying products as gifts I'd advise you to do it elsewhere because of their ridiculous return policy and bad attitudes.

First time and will return. I ordered a lunch special for carry out. Great deal and fast service! I got the spicy noodles and basil with shrimp. It came with lemongrass soup, wonton chips, and an egg roll. I liked that you get a little bit of everything. Also ordered their Thai tea. Everything was delicious and I will be back for dinner. Their seafood hot pot sounds amazing!

The Famous Chopped Salad is to die for! I think I could eat it every day. I ordered the scallops without bacon as my main course. I would have given 5 stars but my scallops came with bacon. The server quickly re plated my entree. The scallops were delicious as well! I had the Cider Shandy and Paloma to drink. They were good but I wasn't overwhelmed. They just changed their cocktail menu so I'm wondering if that had something to do with it.

I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, modern and upscale. The cocktails were special and stood out. My favorites were the Lost Melody and Black Mamba. We had a great server who was very knowledgeable about the spirits. He gave us a few history lessons... It was interesting. Started with the kale salad but wasn't blown away. I had the chicken as my main entree and it was full of flavor and delicious! Shared the chocolate pudding with marshmallow fluff for dessert. SO GOOD. Will definitely return for the cocktails.

My favorite breakfast spot in downtown Phoenix! Great atmosphere and service. You can tell everything is made from scratch. Their fresh squeezed orange juice and honey lemonade is delicious. I usually order the special and the griddle cakes to share with whoever I'm with. I recommend sharing to get the best of everything.

I love this store! I can't speak for the salon because I have never been but I love their products. You can't beat the prices and they have a great customer appreciation program. I like that the store is small and not so overwhelming. Their shelves are always stocked full. The associates are friendly, honest, and helpful. They know the products. Highly recommend!

Nothing stood out to me. Passion fruit cocktail was mediocre. Passion fruit sangria was disgusting. Tacos were average. Appetizers strange.
