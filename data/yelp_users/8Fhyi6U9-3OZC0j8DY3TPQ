Awesome Mexican food. The Chilequillas and Chicharones are amazing! Very low key ambiance and this place can get packed. Wait list up to 30 minutes are very common. Pick your times carefully here. Worth the wait.

Always great Pizza and Wings. The wings are deep fried, but good. The pizza is one of the few pizzas I like with thinner crust, but it has good sauce the crust isn't crispy hard thin. More like NY or Boston style. The ambiance is a bit old school, looks like they have had the same wooden tables and chairs for the past 30 years, but I do like it. It has an old school Phoenix vibe, which there aren't many places that have that anymore. They also have good lunch specials.

Decent breakfast for cheap. Small mom and pop ambience. It's been around since... the sixties? Took Anna M and met up with my Grandma there for brunch. She started talking about back in the day they used to also hang out here and bowl at the Wagon Wheel bowling alley. Older employee chimes in and says, "When they tore down the Wagon Wheel, we used several of there lanes for our bar counter".  The food may not be special, but it doesn't suck. The biscuits and gravy are good, the drinks are cheap and the old Phoenix atmosphere is free.  You got to try once to say you've gone there.

Not your same old bar food here. Great food and large beer menu. Sunday morning breakfast are awesome. The best huevos ranchero I ever had. I know, I know, I spent 10 years in South Phoenix and have had a lot authentic huevos ranchero, but these were amazing. Their artichoke spinach dip is not very good, watery and . Their wings, sliders and hummus are very good.   Casual attire, great for groups. Several big T.V.s in the bar area. The Patios are nice. A nice place for good food and conversation. Nice happy hour prices.   But seriously, stop by for Sunday breakfast. It is the only day they open for breakfast.

I really like Nellos Pizza. Their pizza is very good, but it doesn't stop there. I love their Pork Wings that are smoothered in a house mustard based buffalo sause. They have excellent tossed salads and tasty appatizers. Nice ambiance with a clean, nice, simple, Italian decor. Great place to grab dinner and a drink with family and friends.

We came for the blooming onion. It was cooked in old grease, but still tasted good. The Rib-eye was very tough, as were the kids steak bites. The firecracker Shrimp was ok for breaded shrimp. This was my first time coming to Outback in about 10 years. I was disappointed, but I must admit. I would come back for the blooming onion and happy hour.

The food was very good, but service was sub par. Tried the Tuscan and Cracked Crab Alfredo pizza. very good. Their Prosciutto and Melon was also outstanding.  It took about 20 minutes to get our initial appetizer, and then about 45 minutes for our actual dinner. They forgot one of our items and never brought it out again.  I am a bit torn. Wonderful food, but horrible service.

The Cheesecake is of course always great. Very rich, you may want to split a slice.   Ambiance is very decorative with elaborately painted d√©cor. Can be casual or dressy, depending on how you want to roll.   Crab cakes and flat breads are very good. Plenty of meat in your pasta. Overall, I have had nothing bad here. Some of the meals are average, most are good. Big Portions. Great place to split an appetizer, a meal and slice of cheesecake.

Awesome food. I will have to come back, I might increase to 5 stars. Service was a bit slow, but the food was incredible. Wild mushroom enchiladas and Smoked chicken chili rellenos..... Thank you sir may I have another. Prices are higher than average, but worth it if you want a outstanding Mexican/southwest meal. It has a very modern ambiance and decor. It can get crowded and loud.

This review is for their service department. Prices are pretty fair and competitive compared to other dealerships and mechanics. Paid $400 to have my Power Steering pump fixed because it was leaking in my 2008 TL. A day  later, it is leaking again, worse than it was before. I have called and left messages and no one returns my calls.  The staff do seem very friendly. Nice area to hang uot if you neeed to wait and they provide free beverages and snacks as you wait as well.

Vegetarians deserve cheat days to eat good deep fried food too!!! Welcome to  Green New American Vegetarian. As a carnivore, I must say, this place is very good. I have had their buffalo sandwich and the BFF. Both are outstanding and I will order both again. Their thyme fries are very average. They have a large juice section as well. The ambiance is fast food casual with some cool modern art hanging around the walls and for sale. Order atthe counter, they will bring out the food, and make sure to clean up after yourself. This isn't a full service restaurant.

They had huge calzones that are tasty. Not your typical calzones as they Marinara sauce in side. They are basically a folded pizza, and they are very good. I would absolutely order pizza from here based off their calzone. I had the Otto Calzone with Pepperoni, Pineapple and Jalapenos. The sauce and dough was good. The I like my pizza dough to be a little thick, and it was, just the right amount. Pineapple and Jalapenos were from a can. It was good though. Fresh veggies and it would had been better. Small mom and pop feel inside, not a lot of room to sit and eat. I had my calzone to go.

One of the poorest food quality  I have had in a long time. The service was outstanding! The food was cooked well and to order, but the quality was way way below standards of even a causal. The worst  Mahi Mahi I have ever had. The Braised Ribs where very bland with no flavor. The Fillet was chewy. The  Peanut Butter Mousse was bit sour and not sweet.  The Calamari was really good. Ambiance is very classy.

The food here is above average to good. The mini chimis are good, the chicken is better than the beef. Most of the food is pretty good, nothing healthy about it keep in mind. It's a cool Mexican-American ambiance.   What makes this 4 stars then you ask? This is one of the best happy hours in Phoenix. 1/2 price their tasty and large appetizers and $2 (used be $1) Margaritas. Food is three-four stars, but their happy hour bumps them up to a solid four stars.

Their stuffed shells are very good. Service is slow, but it is meant to be a place where you can sit, talk and relax. It is suppose to be a bit slow.  Overall, good.

Horrible experience. They changed the time to finish after they tore down the car by a week. Rental cars are not cheap. Then charged me a "tear down" fee to retrieve my car, despite not wanting them to put the bumper and grill back on.  - Jessica D. of Gerber Collision & Glass did reach out to me, and I returned her message, but they never got back to me.

It's at Rio Salado College. Cafeteria type setting and ambiance. They have a big garden where they grow their own vegetables. everything else is local. Cafeteria is ran by their sustainable. Awesome salads, some of the best I have had in the valley. They have a great sandwich and Panini Press along with outstanding soups. New pizzas everyday and great specials on the main grill that change daily. Menu changes with what is seasonal. Morning Biscuits and Gravy are the best in the valley. No joke. Best Biscuits ever. Coffee barista is on point.

I grew up eating Pierogis and love them. They have a great selection and they are outstanding! I love the Potato and cheddar, jalapeno and cheddar and potato and sauerkraut. They are a tad above average on the prices, but they are Pierogis, not many places out there do them. Small, clean, nice ma and pop ambiance. They have a market attached with a lot of cool Euro foods. You have to try this place once. I am going back for sure.

Chopped Brisket is awesome! Slap it on a Tortilla with their Hickory BBQ sauce and there you go! The pulled pork is average and the baked mac and cheese is not very cheesy. The baked beans and smoked brisket are very good as well. The ambiance is a cross between hipster, cracker barrel and QT. Yes, I just crossed those three things. I had my car wash there and they did an excellent job, inside and out.

Three restaurants in one spot. The yard is one of the best places to hang out with friends, drink a little, maybe some ping pong or cornhole. Ambiance is casual, flip flops, shorts and ready for good times.   Culinary Dropout - Pork belly toast is awesome. tender and with excellent flavor.  Little Cleo's Seafood Legend - Great variety of oysters. Their frogs legs are the best I have had. The warm jar of king crab & butter with grilled bread is expensive, but well worth it.  Barrio Urbano - The Barrio Guacamole is very good. Thick chunks of avocado with perfect seasoning.  When they are making thier ceviche with young cocanut, get it. Very good.

Walked into the Restaurant at 12:00pm and only 3 people in the place. I should have listened to my gut instinct. However, after skipping breakfast my gut had conflicting reports... The Honey Chicken Wings were bad. The Sesame Chicken was worse. Both sauces tasted almost exactly alike, and they both weren't good. They do give you a lot of food, but not worth it. I couldn't eat half of it. I will not be back here for sure. The ambiance inside is cool. Ma and Pop hole in the place type of place. I got my food to go, but if they had good food, I would come back and dine in.

Brought my three kids here for an afternoon of games and fun. Overall was very disappointed.Had a hard time finishing a single bowling game before we were kicked off our lane. We tried twice. If you purchase a unlimited wrist band, they limit your time. We had 6 people, 3 kids, and they would not allow us to be on 2 lanes, even though there were multiple lanes open 85% of the time. Our games were always stopped before we could finish. The Lazer Tag was fun, but the equipment was very dirty. The Video Games are expensive if you don't buy an unlimited video game deal. They start at $1.65 per game.  The ambiance is very similar to Dave and Busters or Peter Piper Pizza, but leans heavily more toward a Peter Piper Pizza with a couple more adult friendly attractions.

Some of the best BBQ I have ever had, and I have had a lot. HUGE lines at lunch. I waited 45 minutes my first time. All the meat there is good. I love the Lamb neck. The Pastrami is the best I ever had. Group sitting outside, very little room inside. You will wait in line for lunch, be advised. 45 - 90 minutes. Part of the experience I suppose. It was worth the wait if you love BBQ.

You know when I restaurant goes the extra mile for quality, Snooze AM does that. Hipster ambiance, which isn't my style, but I don't mind it either. Will be back soon!

So good.... Had the Paneer Kathi Wrap and Butter Masala. So very amazing. I am coming back for sure. I don't know if I can ever bring myself to order anything... Cafeteria/market ambiance.

The wings were very good. Plenty of beer and drink options. Great place to watch the game. 15 big screen TVs with a couple very big screens. TVs all over the place. I didn't dive in to far into the menu as I was here for a Fantasy Football draft. They did give us some specials because we had our draft here.Will comeback and check it out again for sure.

Great place to watch a game. I tried the Hummus plate, it was good with a nice assortment of veggies with it. I then ordered the Steakhouse Truffle hamburger. It was amazing! The sweet Potato tots where very good as well. Add their Mimosia special, $10 for your first one and $1 for everyone after that, and it was an excellent visit. If they are consistent, they might be a five star rating.

Excellent food. The hummus is some of the best I have had. Avocado Jalapeno hummus is crazy tasty. Cuban Panini and E Poe Salad are outstanding! Fast seating, everything taste very fresh. Employees are ultra friendly. Causal fast food. Many dietary needs are met here.

Awesome burgers. Nothing fancy here, these are for people who love the simplicity of the pure, great tasting beef. Add some basic topping if you want and grab some home made fries if you want your carbs. Always a good burger.

A very clean sports bar ambiance.  Nice seating options and patio. The traditional Philly is good. Love the pub fries. Will definitely try this place again.

They did a very good job, I am going to give the membership a shot and see how I like it. A very laid back artistic ambience, and I love that they were playing real hip hop. Mostly oldies such as KRS One earlier stuff and some new stuff mixed in.

I noticed them move in to the AZ Center a while ago and wanted to give them a go. I was pleasantly surprised. The Bruschetta was good. I had their Pollo Scaloppini and it was amazing. My girlfriend had the Risotto De Zucca, and it was also amazing. Service was good and we sat out side on and cool spring evening. Clean, contemporary ambiance. Fits very well where located. I will absolutely be back.
