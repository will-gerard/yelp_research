My friend and I walked in this store the other day. The store had at least 7 employees standing around and talking with each other. We were not greeted or asked anything..We were completely ignored. After about 10 minutes, Enough time for me to explain the differences between phones to my friend. We looked around and still no help. So we left I looked at one group of associates and said thanks for your help in deciding what store not to come back to. She just smiled and said have a nice day!

I did not like the service the guy was very rude. He seemed like I was a inconvenience to him. The service was very fast.. I have to check to see if they even changed my oil it was so fast. I would not recommend this place to any of my friends. I will not be coming back. I did give this place 1 star because if they really changed my oil that fast they do deserve some credit.
