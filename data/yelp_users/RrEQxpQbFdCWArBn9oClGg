My experience definitely was not favorable, but it was not the worst I've ever had. It's always annoying when I go to the grocery store and it appears there are several associates available, there are long lines (10 min waiting time) and there are several registers that aren't being utilized. The reason I decided to get Yelpy on this occasion is because my experience was with the Store Manager.   There were long lines, I had 2 items, I saw the manager cashing out a customer, however the light was out at his register, so I asked him if his line was open. The 1st time I asked, he either couldn't hear me or was ignoring me, so I asked again and he replied "yes" (with a tone to his voice, like duh).   The way he responded gave me a sour feeling about the customer service. I was thinking, since he was so matter of the fact, being that he was CLEARLY open, he should've turned on the light at his register to indicate that he was open and let the patient customers at his store know that he could help the next person.

Snow during the holidays to play outside on the front yard is awesome! The four levels of exhibits are very nice quality and educational. The exhibits seem to be appealing for kids 3-13. I would definitely say admission price is a bit steep being that adults are there to chaperone kids and if 2 adults went with a child, that's $36 plus the $13 children's admission per child. And of course each attraction on each level cost of the premium of $9 per adult and $8 per child. Even if you have a membership to the science center, in order to see the exhibits, you must pay each exhibit's fee... Pretty spendy outing!

This is the best European specialty repair shop in the Phoenix Valley!  I have been going to Atwood European with my Mercedes for seven years, so I feel I have a very accurate accountance of the quality of service at this European specialty shop.  It is very obvious that the owner knows his stuff to properly diagnose your vehicle without raking you over the coals. The prices are far below the dealership and the quality of service is outstanding! If you need a ride to or from the shop while your vehicle is being repaired, they have a courtesy vehicle at your call. Since I do not know a ton about under the hood, I could easily be confused about what's going on with my car. The owner takes the time to explain all of the diagnosis and your options. I 100% trust this shop and thanks to Atwood European, my 11 year old G-Wagon runs like a new beauty!

Very friendly cashiers. I love it when you go somewhere and you can tell employees love their job.  I experienced 2 very pleasant customer service representatives and my cashier was eager to encourage the sale special. Coupons are such a fun bonus!

The food was great and the service was great. Everything was a bit overpriced but I guess it comes with the territory. The grilled artichoke appetizer was creative and yummy. I also enjoyed the khalesalad with cashews in it as a side dish to my French onion dip sandwich. The spinach artichoke dip was also very yummy. The lemonade and tea were not my speed. Go smoke salmon was very delicious, perfectly cooked and most importantly it was juicy and flavorful.

It really bothers me when I walk in and there are 3 or 4 representatives twittling their thumbs and when I check in, I'm told it will be over an hour before a representative can assist me.... Then we always have to go there, MANAGER. Then immediate assistance is provided. Seriously, that's poor customer service and leaves me with a bad feeling about my apple products that I pay a million dollars for with monthly service fees.

I have been to this Home Depot 4 times in the last week. Therefore, I have had a good amount of interactions with customer service reps. Overall, I am 100% satisfied with the products I have been recommended. However, I had to snatch a star down because there's a bit of a wait (5-10 min) for assistance every time.

The food is really delicious here and definitely is made fresh to order. My favorite dish is the barbecue chicken over cabbage white rice and scoops of macaroni salad, Yum! The value is very fair with large portions and plenty of protein for eight dollars. The customer service could be a little friendlier.

My service was so aweful, I really thought I was being punked. I walked in to Panda Express and instead of being greeted, I was told that "this is all that they've got" and they don't make anything else because they were closing soon. Excuuuuse me? Four-fifths of the food pans were all gone. A whole baseball team walked in after me and they were rudely discouraged from ordering, because all they had was out so they left. I insisted on speaking to a manager. I let him him know that his line expediter was expediting customers right out the door. He apologized and had his cook make my plate. At this point, the damage was already done.

I came to panda for lunch today and they have done an excellent job with getting a lot of customers thru the line quickly with top quality food. Last time I had a bad customer service experience but things have been great today. I can overlook the bad service of one customer service representative if the rest of them are excellent.

I'm sure you're thinking, who writes a Yelp review about the Emergency Room... I do! I was very pleased with the services performed by the ER doctor, nurses and X-Ray techs at John C Lincoln hospital. My fiancés car was struck by a car that ran a red light.   The ambulance arrived to the scene within minutes of the accident and brought him from his unconscious state. I really appreciate that they called and notified me upon their arrival at the scene.  At the hospital they administered a battery of tests within an hour. They made sure he was ok and they definitely gave him top tier treatment.   Thank you John C Lincoln hospital!

My fiancé and I love this place. We went on a late dinner date and were super impressed. Our hopes were set very high since we came by way of referral and our expectations were exceeded! Our favorite was the Big Johnson. My referral told me to ask for it X-Rated, so we did... and oh what a joy it was... Mmmmm. We lucked up and it was happy hour. Ichi ni san!!

Before now, I've never been ignored by sales associates when the store is virtually empty. Maybe the exhaustion from all of the weekend's sales drained all of the sales luster. Despite my fitting room request light being lit for over 5 min with no attendant ever coming to my assistance, I still managed on my own. Spending over $100 at an establishment deserves at least a little customer assistance.

The manager, Kristin goes out of her way to being rude to customers! I have been banking with Bank of America for 15 years and I expect to be treated with more courtesy than was afforded during my experience at this Bank of America location. I would likely never come back! Don't go here unless you're expected to be treated rudely.

This diner has consistently good food and excellent service. The old fashioned style restaurant is definitely a staple in the West Valley. I've never been disappointed with the portions or flavor of food. This is definitely a good breakfast/brunch experience for casual day. My favorite's are there skillets that come with a little bit of everything. For a hearty brunch under $9, you can't beat it anywhere in the Phoenix valley.

I didn't love the customer service by any stretch of the imagination. I came to get my daughter Barbies for her Barbie house and the cashier didn't even want to honor the advertised price. Nevermind the fact that I even had a snapshot of the sales price. They even called a clerk to the front to go double-check... As if I was trying to scam them.   The icing to my disappointment with the customer service is that the cashier didn't even give me rewards club points and I had specifically asked him to give me rewards points for my purchase.

Love this resort! The pool is super cool. Where else can you go in Arizona and get a sandy beach that drifts off into the pool. The water slide is comparable to ones at water parks. There are different sections to the pool so you and your guests feel welcome to congregate in your own area in an ultra shallow area or deeper part of the pool. There's a nice basketball hoop for a friendly game of bball in the pool and pretty fountains in the middle of the pool. The courtesy ice water canteens were nice in the summer heat and there was a free craft table staffed by the resort for the kiddos.. Really cool crafts like wooden snakes that you paint. After the pool we hit up the Arcade for foos-ball, pac-man, the pinball machine and more. Oh, and the arcade was free too. What a great value!

I've been here for services three times and I've been happy with my services two of the three times. The students seem like they try their best to satisfy the customer but of course they're still learning and need a little slack cut on their knowledge level and expertise. I'm someone who always speaks up so I don't have a problem with letting the student know if the services are not as I'm used to. The instructor Jillian is amazing, super knowledgeable and willing to hands on instruct her students.

This is a hidden gem. Tucked away in a truck driver Industrial Park, this mom and pop breakfast spot is definitely top notch. The Monte Cristo and Pancakes are excellent. You can definitely taste the freshness in their "from scratch" recipes on down to the jumbo muffins and baked goods. The homemade muffins remind me of my mom's... Super yummy!

I feel like I just did "Extreme Couponing" but without coupons needed. I know you're eager to read on!! Where in America in 2014 can you go to the store and get a pair of kids shoes and a household item, all for a grand total of $2.61 with tax included? Wally Wal! I like this Wal-Mart because EVERYTHING is always in stock with the exception of black-eyed peas on New Years Eve.

This furniture store is super family friendly and the guys are always very courteous and helpful. John Fry was particularly nice this evening and gave me a walk-through of their couch inventory. I am looking for a recliner that does not let my feet dangle even though I'm 6'2". John is going to help me the best he can so that when I buy in the next two months for my new home, I will have the perfect furniture.

Excellent customer service! These guys went out of their way to help me out. They let me borrow a nice tire jack and upon arrival to the shop, they got the car right in to torque the tire and make sure everything was safe with the car. The guys all hustle around to help customers as fast and efficient as possible.

I was very pleased with my entire experience. I didn't have to wait like at most salons. My mani and pedi were done simultaneously by two technicians. They both did a great job. The massage was relaxing! I really appreciated that with my picky preference any flaws I saw were perfected and the nail techs had no problem with that. I think I have found my new favorite neighborhood nail salon. I'm going to put them to the true test next time when I get gel polish done.

The food is good and definitely a fair value. I can appreciate that they label some of their dishes "gourmet". This restaurant is a family friendly atmosphere. Since I was a kid, this was one of my favorite restaurants and that they are able to evolve their menu with the times is why I believe they have been successful over the years. 20 years ago my favorite was the Red  Robin taco salad

Why would a large franchise store I like this be understaffed during the holidays?? There are six parties in line ahead of me there are two cashiers for over 30 customers. This is crazy! I had to circle the entire store to find one customer service representative. This franchise needs to get it together. If my math is correct, I will be in line over 20 minutes before I get to the cashier, wow!

Very nice customer service system, especially for a government run establishment. The receptionist is very warm and friendly with her greeting. It sweetened the deal that there was no long line of people waiting. Online it states that they close at 4:30PM however the sign on the door says 5PM. Since I'm usually fashionably late, their hours worked in my favor.

This is such a cute and quaint dive bar with a down home southern style feel to it. When you walk in, most everyone looks to see if they know you and it feels like there are the regulars here, where the guys outnumber the girls by far so if you were looking for a sausage fest, cheers! You can always count on live music and from the times I've been, the musician will typically sing into the mic as they stroll the club with a tip jar in hand for you to plentifully fill. Dancing is encouraged! If you are tall, prepare to talk through the doorways of this historic type house turned into a blues/ jazz live music night club.

I can always count on them having a wide variety of hair products. All of their  leeks are very knowledgeable about all of their merchandise of they will promptly get someone to assist you. They stay up with the trends and the hip music playing softly in the background picks up your mood. On top of it all, they are open longer hours than their competitors daily.

I had the Fish-N-Chips for dinner. I was very underwhelmed with the flavor of the dish. It was obvious to me that the fish was fried frozen because it taste dry like cardboard, there was no texture to the fish and it was very flavorless. This result happens when you fry frozen product. It is disappointing to pay $16 for frozen fish and fries.   Two people in my party ordered fish and chips and it was evident that they only had enough fish for one plate but instead they split one portion of fish onto two plates. Right when the waitress delivered the plates to the table, she said "oh it looks like they forgot the rest of your fish" as if it was scripted. 10 min later she returned with the rest of our 2 orders of fish. That was cheap!  We went here for a family dinner so several dishes were ordered. I was pleased with the seafood crab cake appetizer. The crabcake taste a little bit like stuffing but the seafood was definitely fresh and the sauces that engulfed the crabcake were tasty.  The appetizer sampler was tasty as well. The eggrolls with their dipping sauces were delicious, the spinach artichoke dip taste like it was made with fresh artichokes which is nice and the fried squash is a fun addition to an appetizer sampler as well.  I don't know if it was because it was the end of the night, and the cook was tired of making food, but two of our items were messed up... well actually shorted. The appetizer sampler did not come out with the items on it that were listed and we had to bring it to their attention. There were no eggrolls on our plate.... That was supposed to be the featured item on the sampler.

As a female who doesn't know a lot about different tools and everything it takes to do certain projects, it's a little discouraging asking the experienced professional employees for assistance at Home Depot. It's like they talk to you in legal jargon that you don't understand and tell you to go to certain isles where you can find what you need. They're very informed about the products in their department and usually pretty friendly, but they definitely keep it moving. So, from that point you're on your own to figure it out. Duh That's why there's the DIY channel on TV.

It's very inconvenient when the bank does not schedule the appropriate amount of their bankers and tellers to adequately assist their customers.   On a Monday at lunchtime, I walked in to make a quick withdraw.... I immediately acknowledged that was a fairytale. There were upwards of 20 customers in line to be assisted by 2 cashiers who were also juggling the drive-thru transactions.   Mind you, there were 4 bankers sitting at their desks, entertaining each other with idle chit-chat. I had to say something (in attempts to represent us customers). It was very ear that if you needed to conduct a transaction, you would be committing to at least 20 minutes in line. Uh, no... I am in heels and this wait in line would not be worth me allocating a good portion of the shelf-life of my time in heels for the day... Hello! Plus this is Scottsdale and there were no offerings of water, or tea and crumpets for that matter.  In conclusion, one of the bankers had me sit down with him (approximately 10 minutes) while they up'd my withdraw limit, where I ultimately was directed to use their in house ATM machine.

I'm going to give four stars for the atmosphere and the food. It was a bit busy, so we waited upwards of 20 minutes for a seat and upwards of 20 minutes for our food to be served. Never mind the fact that they were out of my meal but they made it up to me which is all good. If you have a birthday, this is the place to go if you want to be seen and get a shout out.

Happy hour on Tuesdays is the business! On a light note, Joe actually works there. Ha ha ha the bartender's name is Joe and he gets teased all day every day about that. The Two dollar menu with appetizers and drinks is the business! The crab dip is definitely the best ($5). $2 fried pickles and calamari are a close second, as for the voodoo chicken, I can't vouch for the voodoo portion of it but for two dollars, I'll take it. The fried shrimp n fries was nothing to write home about. If you're planning to order a sandwich from the menu, you should definitely pass on the crabby patty because it's pretty dry and unflavorful or at least not what I was expecting. We can leave that to SpongeBob. But the two dollar hurricane... #TurnUpTuesday

Steer clear of this place unless you're in the mood to be angry. I am so appalled at the way my family was treated by the manager Selena when we opted to dine in during open hours. She warned us that they would be closing in 10 minutes but I was confused, the sign on the door said they close at 10 o'clock and it was only 9:20 PM. She came over to us a few minutes later and told us they were closing and I let her know we were aware. She then stood there as if we were supposed to get up and leave so I told her if you want us to leave, we can leave now but that's very unprofessional because this franchise establishment states on the door that you are open until 10. Never mind the fact that everything was all packed away by 9:30 PM and all the food was cold... What if a customer came through the drive-through? Oh I know, they would be turned away because there were no other meal provisions available. Additionally I feel terribly uncomfortable and Claster phobic that they locked us in at 9:30PM. I will never go back to this panda express under any circumstance other than to point the manager out to her higher-ups for reprimanding.

Yummm the croissants at this small family owned pastry shop are to die for. There are perhaps 20 different fruit and other sweet flavored croissants to select from. My favorite is the strawberry. I first decided to stop into this shop 3 weeks ago and I have been back at least 4 times since... I'm hooked. My favorite part about the pastries is that you can tell that the fruit fillings are made from scratch and God Bless the pastry chef for not being heavy handed on the sugar as to avoid the tragic syrupy-jelly effect. The quich are also very scrumptious with a light-flakey crust. The Lorraine is my fav and it is just enough to fill you, while not making you feel like a guilty glutton. Oh, and the prices are suuuper fair. I don't know where else in America you can get a fresh baked croissant for under $3, so great job team P' Croissant. I'm officially a regular.

If I had to use 1 word to describe the food, I'd say "sustenance". I had the chicken burrito and the seasoning was non-existent, however the portion was rather large. The horchata taste like the cheap kind with a gritty texture. The service was friendly, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. I was starving so this was something to tide me over and that's it.

This is my favorite store, but sometimes I hate it. It is very hit or miss with good stuff. I would best describe this as a designer thrift store. You have to dig and dig for at least an hour to find the little gem that fits you perfectly. It may be tucked away in the wrong size section because someone loved it and tried to hide it. Or what appeared to be the perfect item may have indelible fouls like a huge tear in the sideseam but that's where the savings comes in if you have a tailor that can do a minor alteration for super cheap.  It's super funny when you see people being aggressive shoppers here. There is a pre-recorded automated message that comes on the loudspeaker periodically that warms aggressive shoppers that you will be asked to leave the store for the day. LOL

The atmosphere is super posh and cool however my family was rubbed wrong from the start by the greeter/ host. We came in for dinner around 9PM on Wednesday and as a standard at most restaurants when you walk in the host says "hi" and you say "hi" and they welcome you and ask you for your table accommodations. Not in this case! We said "hi" the host said "hi" and she looked at us dumbly and said "how can I help you?" I said, "we're here for dinner" and she had a snooty tone and proceeded to seat us.  The restaurant had one other party in our section however service was terribly slow and our waiter seemed more occupied with getting his side work done for the night, but wait, the restaurant didn't close for another two hours so why were we not being attended to? Every time we needed something, we had to flag down our waiter. For two adults and a child, we paid $100. I would expect much better service than this and in the future, I would go during happy hour because I was still hungry after with the pricey food and drink costs, so perhaps I could catch a bargain at happy hour but other than that I wouldn't go back.

This restaurant has an awesome fusion concept of Chinese-Mexican dishes... Mmm Consistently flavorful and delicious food.  I haven't been here in 2 years and the food still tastes as delicious as it did back then. My favorite dish is the 2 entree plate with jerk chicken and jade red chicken with rice and beans.The black beans are out of this world good!  To top off the meal, they give you a homemade snicker doodle cookie. All of this for $7.95... You can't beat this quality meal value anywhere in town.

I have been enjoying this restaurant for eight years. I love it that their food gets right to the point of being delicious! This spot is a cute little quaint restaurant that generates outstanding Italian food. My favorite is the vodka penne with sausage.

Here for the late night club and dancing. It's definitely a fun late night spot where cover is $15 per person. There are 2 different dance floors with DJ's. One is hip hop and the other is Latin. It's pretty crowded but fun. It must be noted that on the patio, they have "Taqueria El Pariente" that sells the Best "carne asada tacos" in town for just $3.

I went to Maggiano's as a banquet customer and I was thoroughly unimpressed with the food. The host who booked the catering with Maggiano's joked that the chicken marsala was tongue that was dine badly because it was so tough it was impossible to even cut it with my butter knife and I chiseled at it for quite some time...and trust I really dug in, especially since I had a cocktail or two prior and...that dish was unforgivable. Never mind the fact that their pasta with meatballs served family style only had about eight meatballs that were no bigger in circumference than a quarter and that was expected to serve three people...in what world?? I have nothing against old people, however the seasoning in this restaurant is the most suited for senior citizens who have a very sensitive palette to any seasoning. This is obvious by the majority of the clientele at the restaurant that has all white hair and they are clearly in their late 60's to mid 70's. I am so disappointed because I have been looking forward to going to this restaurant for nine years and now that I have come, I was utterly let down and I will never go back!

We thoroughly enjoyed this place! It's a bit pricey, but worth every dime of it! The first time we set-out to go to this place for dinner, we drove around the block 3 times using our navigation and we didn't see it so we gave up. This time we asked neighboring shops and at our second stop, we were guided through their kitchen to the back alley to a random door that looked like a storage closet from outside and mind you, it had no signage on it. And then you enter through the kitchen of Dick's Hideaway as if it's the norm to be directed to a very dark dungeony cave-like dining room. How on earth would even the above average patron find this place??? But I guess that's the concept, hence "Dick's Hideaway."  After such a voyage, I needed to wash my hands, so I was pointed to the bathroom, or should I say "washroom." Never in America have I seen a shower in the restaurant patron's bathroom... until now. I dared my daughter to take a shower but since there was no towel, she opted out.  On to the food. The menu is very southwest (in a good way). We ordered the special of the day, fish trio (smoked salmon, swordfish and mahi) with grilled veggies and hollandaise, 3 enchiladas (pork, beef and smoked turkey), and the garlic butter pasta with grilled chicken for the kiddo. As a cook, I can appreciate all of the freshest ingredients used from the farm fresh grilled veggies to the homemade hollandaise sauce to the fresh made tortillas and mole to my daughter's amazing noodles, which I'd gamble that they are home-made. They have a nice selection of specialty brews, fine wines and their libations are made with fresh fruits and purée which were very tasty and pricey. But my mom always says, you get what you pay for.

The vibe is super cool. Although trendy and somewhat posh, there's a cozy feel about the restaurant. I've enjoyed patio dining on a few occasions now and it's super cute. The patio is along the canal which gives a relaxed feel to things. Although a bit pricey, you are paying for the location and experience and I'd say it was definitely worth it.

This is a hidden gem! I loved the freshness of the homemade Pasta and sauce. The meatballs were made from a very high-quality me as they were not greasy and were very light. The customer service was great and the ambience was perfect with the live music. The prices are a bit high, however the product is top quality so that is justified. They only thing I would change is to have a bit more seasoning for more vibrant flavors. I will definitely be back when I'm in the mood for Italian.

In my attempts to make a Yelpy review, I was pulled aside by the police because I took a picture of the concession stand with 11 employees behind the counter. There were literally 3 employees hovering per register. With that being said, I was in hopes of speedy services. To my dismay, it took approximately 10 minutes to deliver a small cherry icee, and a kids pack which encompassed stale crumby popcorn, fruit snacks and an additional icee that fell far short of frozen.   And this is merely the beginning of their shenanigans. 10 minutes into the movie, I was harassed by the summoning from 2 officers whom were accompanied by the theatre manager. The presence of a party of 3, inclusive of uniformed officers, was undoubtedly inappropriate for the issue that they had at hand. In their proceedings they asked if I had taken pictures. I replied, "Yes, for Yelp". The theatre manager asked me to delete the pictures due to the employees captured on camera consisting of minors. With this 9:30pm showing, the conclusion of the movie was at 11:00 pm. All of these minors still on duty were slaves in violation of child labor laws. But that's none of my business.

The fact that I drove across town after my nearest Kohl's didn't have the right size, the stakes were set very high. The cashier Jim was really nice. He made sure that the marked down sales price of an additional 25% off was honored for all items even though it did not ring up appropriately at the counter. It was nice to not have to wait in a long line to The customer service is excellent at this Kohl's. I will definitely be back again soon.

I just enjoyed the yummiest cake donut I have ever had in my life! The German chocolate cake donut is to die for. I don't know why I have passed this place so many times and not stopped but maybe it was for good reason. Now that I know about this place and how good it is, my diet will be out the window.

My 4 year old daughter loves seafood, so whenever we are leaving the gym, she always asks if we can stop at the Chinese buffet on the way home. I decided to be super mom and cave in to her request, but they were closed during business hours 9/14/15.  I really am not sure why my daughter asks to go there because she doesn't even really eat the food. She just has fun piling things on her plate and playing with it because nothing is ever tasty at Crazy Buffet.

Excellent customer service. I got to the bank just before the line and since I had to cash a $10,000 check, I was definitely treated like a high-roller. I got an escort to the car after so that puts it in perspective as to what type of service was given! Cheers to many more.

I love this printing company. Impress AZ, branch of the national franchise, International Minute Press does very well with the mom and pop shop feel with the personalized service. The 2 sisters Darla and Sarah run the front end and always provide superior customer service. The turn time on bulk copies and flyers is fantastic. I've been using this reputable company for 2 years and the product quality is consistently excellent. As a regular, they know and understand my service needs and timeframes. They always exceed my expectations.

I love this place and the membership price is very fair for the access you receive to products at bulk price. Never mind the fact that the Polish sausage deal they have is the best jumbo Polish deal in town. You can't find a Polish and soda anywhere in this present day and age for $1.50

They must have mistakenly put the chilled chicken for the grilled chicken salad into my sandwich and the fries were room temperature at best in one of the two meals! The good is that the service was friendly and I like the new options that stay up with the trend of hipster food offerings such as brioche buns and pretzel buns and also I like that there is an option for supposed "fresh lemonade" as well as salad options.

Two stars is definitely sufficient for my experience. Two major planning things you should know: 1. Plan to a lot an hour for your rental car transaction. 2. Make sure I bring your insurance card in order to get a rental car. (Even though they pitch that their insurance is included in your rental car price for free)  2 Funny tips: 1. To complete your rental, be prepared to sign and initial as many papers as you do when you're purchasing a new car (at least 10 initials and signatures) 2. When you're driving your rental car off the lot, you may feel like you're leaving automobile-prison.  The attendant let's down the first set of metal bars for you to advance, then the second set of metal bars is let down for you to make your way through the rest of the maze to the exit.

I was shocked when I looked at my bank statement online 48 hours after I got my rental car. There was a $485 charge for a one-day rental what??? When I called the rental car company, they told me to talk to a manager when I returned and they would be able to help me with that credit however my bank account still has a crazy large charge on it.

I have never been able to understand why the people I have encountered in positions at public government buildings with positions of confidentiality choose to go out of their way to loud talk people and make it their mission to Direct you elsewhere so that they do not have to help or provide assistance. Today, when I arrive 15 minutes before closing, I was told no one would be able to help me since they will be closing and everyone has left for the day, on a Tuesday. Shame!

I am sooooo excited, it's my lucky day! For the first time EVER, when I walked up the teller, saw the coin drawer and I instantly felt like I won the lottery. I saw a heaping stack of silver dollar coins and a stack of fifty cent pieces as well. They're all mine!!! My daughter's coin collection is so sweet now. Don't worry, I'm taking them straight to the safe deposit box. This is going to be insanely valuable. Thanks to my visit at the bank today, my 3 year old daughter now owns coins from Elvis Presley's hay-day. Thanks so much to whoever gave their collection to Chase.

I have been going to this practice for three years and have consistently received excellent customer service and treatment. The entire staff is always very friendly and I see them go out of their way for elderly customers and treat them exceptionally nice. The treatment is always excellent and their rates are the best in town! To add to it, they are very kid friendly if you need to bring your kid to your appointment, they have coloring books and snacks.  Although I try to stay away from receiving treatment, I can always count on these guys, especially Mark with the spicy meatball!

I have been to this Chase several times and there's never a wait. The clerks are always professional and courteous. There have been a few occasions when I have needed assistance outside of the standard 1 transaction deposit or withdraw and the cashiers appeared to be unexperienced and needed manager assistance. Overall, pretty good though.

I am appreciative that they're open 24/7, so that is why 2 stars were earned. I went on the late night and the food was all super old and room temperature. The jalapeño poppers were so old, the cheese had turned to the rubbery form. On the bright side, the cashier kid was really nice so I'm going to give him credit. He did give a disclaimer that he was really tired and apologized that he wasn't all the way on point and since he made a couple small errors (forgetting that I just wanted the sandwich and not the meal and loading my drink with ice when I said no ice) I did have to take one star away. Since  they were the only restaurant in the area open on the late night and the service was fast and friendly, I had to give 2 stars. My tip is to count on your microwave at home for your re-heatables.

This place is so cool! You will see all the exotic birds of a tropical rain forest in a natural like habitat. The burger keepers are very knowledgeable, friendly and encourage him is on with the birds so you can try it before you buy it. There were so many beautiful birds from African grey to macaw to Conor's to parrots. Definitely high end with birds priced up to $1800.

The food was good and the service was excellent. Eunice is the hardest working waitress I have ever seen in America! I made sure to let her know she did an awesome job. I sat at the sushi bar and watched her wait on myself and about eight other tables (one of them was a party of 10 people). She seats everyone when you walk in, gets everyone all of their food quickly, drinks, refills and keeps smiles on everyone's faces, then she hustles around and busses all of her tables. I had to give the five stars based on her effort alone. The other two waitresses wandered the dining area at half speed doing I'm not sure what but Eunice definitely has the whole restaurant covered.

We went here for national hotdog day! One dollar per hot dog is a steal of a deal but don't worry, sonic still made their money on their specialty drinks. When we went through the line, it was quite a wait but it was fun because it was obvious to everyone was at sonic to celebrate the national holiday. I really felt a bargain when I could get meals and drinks for three people for under $10. The employee said they have other fun specials throughout the year so stay tuned

My fellow Yelpers have failed me on this one. Just because a restaurant serves your meal in under 5 minutes and that they are open late, does not earn you a 4 star rating. Being a foodie, I asked the cashier (owners wife) what the most popular/ best dish is. I was recommended the chicken shawarma.   My thoughts after my first 2 bites, SERIOUSLY??? I've never had shawarma before, but to me, it taste like white meat chicken simmered in buffalo wing sauce and rolled up in a pita. As for the shredded lettuce my fellow Yelpers referenced, I can't speak on that accompaniment to my shawarma because they must have run out. Lol  The tziki sauce taste like plain yogurt with chunks of cucumber in it and the hummus had such a heavy hand of garlic to it, I felt like I could scare off Dracula with one breath.   On the bright side, the pita was fresh made and delicious, however if the bread is the best and only delicious part of a meal, there's a problem. I know there are vegetarians, vegans, fruitarians and pescetarians. But who just eats bread?  For this restaurant, good thing there are inebriated college students.

I love the crafting supplies at Michaels. Is it just me or when you go down the aisles, isn't it almost impossible to not want to just grab a little of EVERYTHING to make all sorts of little crafty projects!?! I love this place. As such a wonderful added bonus, Michaels always has coupons online. So while I was waiting in line, I went online on my phone and pulled up the coupon. The cashier scanned the barcode on my phone and instantly, 50% off 1 full priced item. I saved $12.50 yaaaay.

The food is tasty and has fresh ingredients and creative new recipes which I can appreciate. We sat at the bar for an after work meeting and tried a few appetizers in addition to having dinner and dessert. My favorite was the fried cheese curds. Overall, everything was good and I would come back for a nice hearty dinner with delicious seasoning.

Pretty disappointed that I had to wait 5min to be greeted for my order because an off the clock employee with a book bag on had to make his plate first and take the last scraping of entrees from a few of their serving pans. What happened to the customer being first?? Now 1/2 of their entrees are gone during dinner rush. When I went to pay, the cashier accepted my money and said she'd be right back. She took my ten dollar bill to the cash-register by the drive-thru window and brought me back change. I think they're having an off day where anything goes!

If you are looking for a royal, "Last Supper" experience, this is definitely the place to go. Hands down, this is my favorite restaurant when I am craving carnage. LOL This restaurant has the most elaborate salad bar in Arizona! They really do a great job of providing dishes with top quality ingredients. There are perhaps 30 different salad/cold side-dish options. This is just a bonus to the main meal. Beyond The coveted salad bar, the concept of exotic meats freshly made and carved straight to your plate... Just genius. Although spendy, the price is definitely fair for the product and service which is provided.

This is a cute, hipster cafe with a bit of the Oregon coffee-shop vibe. The theme screams "healthy eating" including the desserts I selected from the cookie jar. I stopped in on my walk back to the car after dinner for and the idea seemed perfect. Guiltless cookies to satisfy the sweet tooth after dinner! I was in and out of Luci's really quick so I didn't get a chance to read whether or not the cookies were gluten-free, but I would bet my bottom buck that they were. They were super light and almost flakey and not too sugary. My favorite was the snicker doodle, which was closer on the continuum to a moist shortbread than to a sugar cookie. To me, the sea-salt double-chocolate cookie was a bit salty for my taste, but my fiancé liked it. 2 gourmet cookies on the go for under $3 is a good deal!

This sushi spot is a pretty awesome little jewel. It is tucked away off of the highway frontage of I-17 and Northern. We arrived just before the 8PM Happy Hour started and boy was this place packed. At first we were not sure we were going to stay but we walked inside and saw how packed it was and saw large platters of sushi going out to every table. We were sold! This place is not in the best of neighborhoods so we were a little skeptical, especially of sushi. However, we were pleasantly surprised. We got the Aloha roll (which was a bit fishy tasting), the Hollywood roll which was my fav, teriyaki chicken and rice for the kiddo (which was excellent), a sushi and sashimi (raw slices of various fish and octopus) sampler platter, a la carte yellowtail belly meat sashimi (which is my all-time favorite cut of sushi) and it was a high quality and done right here (to give the melt-in-your mouth effect). We also had a roll that had predominately fried elements to it which was the bf's favorite. For dessert, they had cheesecake tempura that I had to try because it sounded interesting and I've never had that before. This was our least liked dish. We would never get it again because there were ice chunks in the middle of the cake and it taste like frozen cheesecake from the box with tempura on in a flashed in the fryer, with strawberries on the side then drizzled chocolate syrup. 2 rounds of saki-bombs were fun as well.  Overall the price was great and the food was really good. This will be one of my new Happy Hour spots.

I love the variety of International seasonings and produce that they offer. This market smells very clean considering the fact that they sell live seafood and fish. I really like it that I can count on this market always having their items in stock at all times. I've never been let down by this store. The prices for their exotic produce is very fair. It is definitely appreciated that cash register lines move quick and the cashiers always know all the codes for their produce by the pound.

The portions are terribly light on the protein and veggies.... But heavy on the starch (rice and noodles). Additionally, I wasn't thrilled with the pad Thai or the soup either. The green curry taste the same as the red curry... Maybe a little more red pepper in the red curry. The customer service was slow and rude even though there were only four other patrons in the restaurant. I would pass on this restaurant next time.

If you're hoping for customer service at this store... Forget about it. Being that I'm tall, I'm able to listen over people's heads. I was ear-hustling about 3 customers in front of me and I heard the Apple "Greeter" turn away everyone in line in front of me with various rebuttals... If I was to expect a different outcome for myself, I would be insane... But I'm not. Lol    I asked for the manager and Aaaaaaah (insert sound of the Angels singing)... Yeah right! 45 minutes later the manager appears and talks to the Greeter and tells her to check me in for a walk-in appointment (this would entail a 2 hour wait). So... I wasn't going to just sit there and pretend that I couldn't hear him talking about me less than 5 feet away. I look up and said, excuse me, are you the manager, and he says, "yes I am. There are a lot more processes and steps that need to be used before you get to me." I replied, "what processes and steps?" He basically said a whole bunch of nothing, and ultimately he helped me... But really Apple? That's what a customer has to go through to get same day service. That's sad.

I was pleasantly impressed with my entire dining experience. Kudos to management for training the discrete up-sale on everything. I consider myself picky and everything I had from the butter to the fresh-baked hot sourdough bread and the crab mac & cheese were all five stars. I can't wait to go back! Their football motiff is a fun touch.

The sweet little cashier lady Lindo was very friendly. Typically when you're inside of the gas station you are able to look out and see what the pump number is however at this gas station that is not the case. I asked the cashier why and she told me that the city of Scottsdale does not permit large numbers on pillars because they consider it unsightly. How inconvenient though!

I have come to this car wash for four years and they always take pride in doing a great job! This car wash is very personable and when you opt for a detailing, the manager takes the time to talk with you and let you know that they are going to do a great job for you, and this result is delivered. Of course no one is perfect, so if there is anything unsatisfactory about your car wash, they want it brought to their attention, and they make sure to fix it and write things with the customer. Excellent customer service!

I had to bump 1 star because the guy making my plate was chintzy on the entree portions. I ordered the shrimp entree which is $1.25 extra, but then he picked me out 5 or 6 shrimp and I had to ask him to include some walnuts since they were supposed to be part of the dish. Most of the entrees were available and plentiful. Good experience

Pretty disappointed because the sushi was a bit fishy tasting for it being fresh sushi. Especially considering that the price was not at all cheap, I was expecting better quality. The location is nice and the feel is swanky however the quality of product does not match the location. Never mind the fact that the restaurant was not busy and it took over 30 minutes for my table to receive three sushi rolls. It was definitely a bad idea to order the kid Bento box for my daughter because we were sitting on the patio and by the time the rest of the food came her plate was ice cold.

The New Yorker is made with the juiciest and most flavorful pastrami I have ever tasted! I really value the fact that the meat doesn't taste like it's been simmering in a steam-table all day. The variety of rare bottled drinks is a really cool way to enjoy a refreshing beverage with your meal. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.

Definitely amazing homemade breakfast! I had to come back for a 2nd time to pinch myself and see if it was too good to be true. You can tell that everything is made from scratch. Love love love the meat lovers plate. I've gotten different renditions of it both times I've come. The Portugese sausage is fantastic as are the biscuits and gravy and blueberry granola pancakes tgat are one of a kind. Oh, don't sleep on their grits that are the bomb!

I love that their dishes are served family style for everyone to share. Their guacamole appetizer is unique in a good way! I've never had a deliciously crisped thin crust cheese pizza as the dipper to fresh made guacamole with cilantro. I crave their Beefstro salad with thinly sliced steak and carmelized onions over spinach and lettuce and house spicy vinaigrette, Yummm! I always try new things but I can't help but to get the salad every time I go. This is my favorite salad for sure.

The ice cream was yummy and the samples were awesome. This cold stone caught my daughters attention because they have an electric train that goes around the train tracks up by the ceiling of the store.

Absolutely delightful! I will for sure be back for more of this heavenly homemade goodness. This ice-cream shop has a perfect variety of options from recommended ice-cream creations to shakes to kids ice cream with a plastic toy landed in it, they've got it all. Churn uses top quality ingredients that are definitely appreciated. I would best describe this spot as a step above Coldstone.

Opting in to the Deep Dish Pizza with the 1 hour wait- DISCLAIMER was definitely the biggest let-down ever. For such an extensive  wait, it's fair to assume that you are ordering something made-to-order and done to perfection... Not in this case. For starters, the appropriate description for this failure should be "would you like a doughy crust with your cheese explosion". There was easily over 36 ounces of cheese mixed with uncooked peppers and onions and a small portion of protein tucked under the cheese bed, then tomato paste slathered over the top.   My family made the decision to go to dinner because we were hungry. The bar was raised a notch when we opted in to the hour pizza. It was such a bust that 2 bites in, we began brainstorming on how we could put it in our new-wave oven at home and cook it till the doughy crust was done, but would that mean the raw peppers and onions mixed in with the cheese would be done too? Wait a second here, that's why we came out to dinner... for the Oreganos chefs to do that part.   Result: Manager confirmed that the pizza was definitely undercooked (as he slipped the spatula under the pizza and played with the floppy crust). He then apologized and offered dessert on the house. The peanut butter cookie topped with ice-cream was a tasty dinner replacement.

I went here for a friend 's birthday party where she had the patio reserved. To me, the food was just average in reference to the flavor profiles. The beverages were definitely very overpriced. I do like that this establishment makes dog treats for you to take home to your doggie. Definitely a hip atmosphere. I would go back!

My Lox and pretzel bagel were very tasty. I have gotten this menu items from several different Einstein locations in different states and the product is consistently served the same and delicious. I like the fact that the variety of bagels changes with the season and trend. With this being one of the most expensive menu items, I can appreciate the value and would say it is a fair price. The fresh squeezed orange juice is so refreshing and good! The service was fast and friendly. I will definitely be back.

A bit disappointing for several reasons. First, it was not clear who worked at the store since personnel was underdressed. Upon opening drawers for the allotted sizes and styles that I am accustomed to being uniformly organized, to my dismay, I was overwhelmed with heaping piles of cluttered garments. This was surprising being that it was mid day and very few customers in the store and overstaffed, and it is not Black Friday. Subsequent to presentation displeasure, the manager asked me if I needed assistance with anything and I let her know which garments and sizes I was looking for and she invited me to the pile of clutter. I was a bit shocked that she did not acknowledge that there was no sort of organization to the stock and when I brought it to her attention, she advised me that garments are folded in the drawers at the end of the night it wasn't as if she was embarrassed and tried to tidy up, she left everything as it worse and continued through the store. She suggested that this is done once daily and that was very evident.

Love it love it! The "modern-swanky earthy feel" Best describes this hotel set right in the heart of downtown Phoenix. I was there to help my friend Natasha Duran-Lynch with Hues of Ego. The gala was a preview to fashion week. The hotel was perfect because the hallways have beautiful Decour, the lobby is gorgeous as are the ballrooms and conference rooms which have beautiful views of the city. Whatever the aroma is that the hotel pays a lot of money to scent the air with, smelled fantastic!

This is an awesome gas station/truck stop. Once I had a flat tire and was able to call upon them for roadside assistance which was super friendly. The fact do they have Arby's connected to them, two thumbs up. This truckstop always has friendly staff and they keep it very clean which I can definitely appreciate.

The food is excellent, the prices are very fair and the customer service is excellent. Super cute hipster location with an open kitchen. When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly guy who seemed to fit the roll of a manager. He explained how it works, you order at the counter first and get a number and there always seems to be enough open space (tables) once you order and get your number. The server will bring your food out a few minutes later.   We all opted for the fresh orange juice, which was outstanding! We had the Pain Perdu which I didn't care for.  I was thinking Pain Perdu was going to be a banana French toast/ bread pudding type of deal, but to me it taste like soggy fruit cake with bananas over it and a rich caramel sauce.The floating manager guy was super accommodating and recommended the Orchard French toast as a replacement. Yummy. The French toast was perfect with the apple ribbons to provide a nice subtle Apple crunch and flavor change throughout the dish. We had Johnny pancakes with eggs over easy which was my fav. The pancakes are huge and delicious and the eggs were perfectly seasoned and cooked. We had pork sausage, turkey sausage and the potatoes side. All were delicious! The sausage was hearty, a bit spicy and good sized, but most importantly, not oily so the high quality of meat should definitely be noted. This was the best turkey sausage I've ever had. We also got the waffle kid's meal which comes with 3 delicious fluffy waffle sections and a sausage for $4.95.   2 adult meals, a kids meal and 3 fresh orange juice for $33 is a very great deal. We can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.

This is my favorite Thai restaurant! The coconut curry soup is to die for. The Pad-See Yu has a wonderful seasoning on the flat noodles and a medley of mussels, shrimp, calamari and fried fish. You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes. This is a tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant in South Phoenix. It's definitely a well known secret! People come from all over to enjoy this cuisine.

What's not to love about 50% off and more! I feel like this is by far the best Holiday shopping deal! The customer service representatives were all very friendly to us and greeted us with the announcement of their sale as if we had won the lottery. All of the customers in the store were very bubbly and happy too because everyone appreciated the value. Love was definitely in the air.

The food was ok, but it was definitely nothing special. We got their appetizer sampler as well as street tacos. My mom always says, you get what you pay for,and in this occasion, that clique rang true. I'm not sure what kind of steak was in the tacos, but that meat was so dry and flavorless, "fresh beef jerky" is a more suitable way to describe it. I was thinking there would be at least 1 winner in the appetizer trio... wrong again. The rolled tacos and mini chimis taste like they came out of a frozen dinner package from the grocery store. The 2nd star was earned because the decor was at least average, the servers were attentive and their AC was nice and cool.

This place has a quiet sports bar type of feel to it. With the open dining room and the menu. We were not sure what to expect with the name "Spoke and Wheel". We tried the Mack and cheese with fresh fruit fish and chips three street tacos and the burger with garlic Parmesan fries. The fish and chips was bland fish that was fried with a plain tempura on it, however the regular fries were tasty as if they were cooked in a high-quality oil. The street tacos had excellent presentation and the steak taco was my favorite of them. The burger was outstanding as you could taste the quality of beef. The garlic Parmesan fries were overwhelmingly garlicky and would probably knock Dracula dead! Not sure we would come back because there was nothing to write home about out of the four meals we had.

I don't even know why I tried this place again. I guess I was thinking, third time will be a charm... NOT! My first time, the acrylic nails looked sooo thick and chunky, they looked like I experimented with a "Do it Yourself" nail kit. The second time, my manicure looked like it was done by Helen Keller. Today, I called ahead because I happened to be in the neighborhood at my daughter's Grandmas house, so I was like, what the heck, why not. So I arrived 15min later and they told me to come back tomorrow, seriously??? I just called in advance.

This gas station has the most dishonest, shady, and unethical gas price postings I have ever seen! Nine times out of ten, you go to a gas station because of the posted gas price. When you see a price that is .5  cheaper per gallon than the competitor across the street, most likely you would be sold on the lower priced gas station, of course. I feel like a sucker to the scam! When I was just about to pump, I saw a disclaimer that said if you pay with cash that is the price but if you pay with debit or credit, the price is five cent higher per gallon, Holly Cow! This can't be legal. Needless to say, I will never buy gas at this gas station again.  To express my displeasure, I wanted to peel out as I left but I'm a little classier than that. Lol

It's noon, so lunch rush... I get it. I ordered "combo 2" (2 tacos, fries and a soft drink). I was quoted 10 min but actual service time was 15 min. If you ask me, that's a bit long for fried fish and shrimp on plain tortillas where you take them to the salad bar and build them yourself. The cilantro mayo is a winner though! Yummm  It would be handy if the tables were re-positioned, especially during lunch, where a lot of individuals are coming in to order. There was no seating available, so if you are one of the many waiting for your order, you will likely feel yourself in the way and awkwardly looming over the shoulders of those seated and eating.   The food is tasty, but the flow of things needs a little work. Overall, I would definitely go back. I'd say it is a good value for the price. The creative twist to the sauces, slaw and salsa really make the tacos unique. I would definitely go back again.

The rice bowl is outstanding! I am not even remotely a vegetarian or vegan however I love this meal every time I come. The restaurant is very hipster yet quaint and cozy which reminds me of home in Alaska. You can definitely taste the freshness and quality of ingredients. The price for the product is very fair. There are so many delicious options which make you want to come back to this restaurant again and again. I can really appreciate the fact that the menu clearly specifies dietary restrictions which is important.

The food came out fast and fresh and there was friendly service. They always get the order right and get you in and out in a timely fashion. I've been to the sonic several times and the kids love it so I will continue to go back for a quick fast food option. Sonic always has new trendy options like pretzel buns and croissant buns and brioche buns.

The best thing about this store is that they have extended hours and all of their product is always in stock which is very professional. The employees are always knowledgeable of product lines and able to assist you right away.  I know I just said it, but I'm going to say it again. The girls who work there are always very helpful!

I had to take 1 star away because it's a bummer when 2 of the signature items are sold out. I made quite a journey to taste the beef brisket and ribs but they were both gone. As I searched the menu, nothing else really jumped out at me other than the fact that a turkey leg was $19. I get it that their meat is smoked in house for 8 hours, but Holy smokes! The menu was a little pricey, so I just went for the Nacos which were scrumptious and the 3 for 10 moonshine shots only because I had never had moonshine before. The homemade apple pie moonshine sample is what sold me. If I was a regular at Bootleggers, I'd be a lush for that shot! The 4 cheese mac and cheese was above average but I wouldn't need it again. I have high hopes for the beef brisket and ribs on my next visit.

The spices were very vibrant in each dish and definitely excited my palette as I have never had food like this before. Although I've never been to India, this is what I would imagine the authentic cuisine to taste like. I enjoyed everything at this quaint buffet. From the tandoori chicken to the curry, the flavor profiles were bursting with uniqueness!   Don't sleep on this quaint Indian restaurant!

To die for! Super fresh and super delicious donuts. My favorite was the chocolate cake donut. It tastes like a piece of chocolate cake, it was very light, chocolatey and delicious. It was worth me seeking them out. My expectations were set high sense navigation through me off and took me through a residential neighborhood to get to this heavenly location. I am going to spread the good word about this place and I will definitely be back!

The tellers were super knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. The only reason I came to this branch was to get an on the spot debit card. I was told by 2 different branches that the Apache & Rural location is the only location in the valley that can make you a debit card on the spot.   I wasn't trying to be nosey, but I couldn't help but overhear another customer in crisis because her account had been hacked through a Home Depot transaction. The Chase banker was able to resolve the issue on the spot and bring the customer's anxiety down.  Good job Chase!

Super slow customer service!I have been to the store twice and both times the employees that I ask about products do not seem to know anything about where anything is and what products they have.  It's fair to assume that if you are shopping at a restaurant store, you're likely on a time schedule and it's not like you're on a carefree, timeless or leisurely stroll at the mall.  That being said, it was darn-right rude that when I was at the check-out and the cashier wasn't sure how many units of shrimp were in a case (after I informed them, 5) the "runner" slowly walked back to the freezer to double-check...so I thought. About 5 minutes later he still hasn't returned, so I jogged back to the freezer and saw him engaged in a conversation with a customer.   I just grabbed a full case of product and ran it back up to the front register myself.   This all could have been avoided if the cashiers were trained and required to know their products.   Tip: there's no point in asking any employees anything.

I love this store and the customer service just as much as I consistently despise the Apple Store's lack of customer service. Here they go out of their way to accommodate every customer within 5 minutes which is super reasonable. They even offer you something to drink while you wait. They also make a point to remember your name and I can really appreciate that. Thanks Microsoft!

To top it off, they gave me their punchcard where you get a free pedicure on your 10th visit.

After becoming a regular at this salon, I soon learned that my 1st experience at the shop was beginners luck. This tucked away nail salon has inexperienced nail techs and the other business partner is very rude. I drop $30-$60 plus tip on my nails being done since the week the shop re-opened "under new management". I wanted to believe in this shop since it's just up the street from my house.  Bottom line: The co-owner is very rude! On 1 occasion, he told me to go somewhere else to get my nails done, when I asked if he (who was doing my nails) could put another coat of gel polish on because the nails were very thin. I walked off that comment and had him finish my nails. Of course the nails were paper-thin because of how much they were buffed down and consequently, 1 nail tore less than 3 hours later with me doing virtually nothing (going home, eating dinner and watching tv). I returned the next day and  the unkind business partner was near the front of the shop to greet and he just looked at me and went back to what he was doing. The nice business partner came from the back, greeted me and assisted me. Because of him, I came back for a pedicure the next week. The nail tech lady made it look like Helen Keller did my nails. They weren't filed straight and the wells of the nails were flooded with polish. I definitely could have done better at home. I really felt a loyalty to give my money to this shop because the one business partner and his wife were always nice to me. So when I came 2 weeks later for gel polish and a pedicure, when I walked in the door at 2 o'clock (in hopes of seeing the nice business partner or his wife), the mean business partner yelled out, "we're all booked up". I said, "for the rest of the day?" He said "yep". I was totally thinking, yeah right.

I went during happy hour and stayed for about 30 minutes. Everything was about average. The food to me taste more like Barfood. For some reason I was expecting higher quality food. Same with the beverages. The new trendy thing is to use fresh fruits and beverages not syrupy concentrates. I ordered and was a bit disappointed in the quality of product I received. I probably would not go back.

There was a plethora of toppings ranging from fruit to Boba to candy to chocolate to syrups. However, I would have liked to seen more than the 10 ice cream flavors. The bowl/cup size was pretty large and there was no kids size cup so I opted for their cardboard splitter so we could do half the bowl for my daughter and half for me since it was such a giant bowl. It came to just under six dollars which was fair.

This restaurant is pretty cool. They have pho as well as spaghetti and rice bowls. What a variety! I'm picky about my pho and they passed! Delicious flavored broth, noodles cooked just right, nice flavored meat, fresh sprouts, basil, green onions and lime to crisp the dish. Two thumbs up to this new business.
