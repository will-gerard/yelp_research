My normal sub place has always been quiznos.  I heard about cheba hut from a friend.  I figured, what the heck?  Ill give it a try.  Glad I did because WOW.  Subs were awesome.   It has a weird "get high" type of vibe to it, which I don't really know how "getting high" and eating a sub relates but, whatever....enough rambling on....Subs are delicious period.  They have a few convenient locations you can hit.  Use google maps on your smart phone and have a great lunch or dinner.   Yay! Im a fan.

Fastest Service in town,   The guys that work there are so efficient.   If you need to mail something in a hurry.   Go to this UPS location.    The best one I've found so far.

i Live right by this place but i never stopped in because it doesn't look appealing from the outside.  But after trying most other restaurants in the area and my need for something quick and close kicked in I decided to give this place a try.   GLAD I did.   It was actually very good.   THey give you chips and salsa to start.  And quite a big portion as well.   It was delicious.   I ordered the taco salad.   They call it a different name but that's pretty much what it is.   ANd that was delicious as well.   It also came with these large cracker looking deep fried chips that were awesome.   My friend had some chicken and rice which looked great and my friend said tasted great as well.  I will definetely be going back soon.    One of my faves for mexican food.    The only reason for not the 5th star was because although the service was nice and pleasant everytime we needed something we had to flag our server down.   She wasn't too attentive.   So overall 4 stars in my book and I'll be back for sure.

I love the good egg because after a late night of partying I can wake up with a hangover and walk to the good egg because I live that close and grab some breakfast.   I especially love the egg muffins with blackberry jam and cottage cheese.   Odd combination but delicious.   the service is pretty much terrible everytime I go.   But I can stand it...I guess after coming for so long you just become used to it.  Haha.  Weird I know...    The best part of the Good EGG.   There is never a wait.    Even on a weekend the wait may be for 5 minutes.   It's just never jammed packed.   I don't know why that is.     Their protein shakes are the best.   I don't know how they make them but they come out just right.    Fruit salads are great.    Pancakes are decent.   Coffee is really good.   And the patio is great.   If you don't like it the 1st time you'll probably like it the second time.

I decided to go today after a friend recommended.  It's in an older looking place but very warm and cozy on the inside.  Service was spot on, they came and took drink order right away.  I ordered the oatmeal, and my friend ordered eggs, bacon and toast.  The oatmeal was delicious, they served it with butter, milk, and brown sugar on the side.  Perfect!  We also had cofee which also tasted great.  Had 2 cups!.  My friend also loved his meal.  The prices were great also.  Only 16.00 tab at the end of the meal. What I really enjoyed about the place were the servers.  All were dressed nicely with makeup and were very friendly.  I will definetley visit again.

Although I used to enjoy coming here the past 3 times have been terrible.   The service is still good so I give a star for that.   The food is still good so I'll give a star for that also.   But,  Im taking away a star for cleanliness.   The place has really gone down in cleanliness.  Just because your food is good and you have good looking servers doesn't mean your customers will continue to come back.  These other areas are important as well.   In the booth we sat in there was so much dust on the picture hanging on the wall I couldnt tell the color of the frame.    And they have an awful odor coming out of their kitchen.   I asked the server and a manager what the problems were and they told me they have a broken sewer pipe.  What??  You have a broken pipe and you let your place smell like poop and don't care to fix it?   Nice guys.   Good Job.  Sadly I wont be returning.  I'll go to Chompies instead.

Went to Vegas for the weekend.  YEAAAA!  Even though I lost 3K gambling we did end up having a great dinner at BOA.  The place was nice and the booth seating was very comfortable.  I LOVE THEIR FRESH SALAD.  O my goodnes.  They literally wheel over a cart and make a fresh salad right in front of you.  They put all the herbs and spices into a bowl, make the dressing a presto.....fresh salad.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because although it was delicious (especially the donut holes for dessert)  i feel when you are paying $50 for a steak it should come out perfect everytime.  The steak they served me was tasty, but had more fat on it then real meat.  The most fatty steak I've ever had.  Granted it was a ribeye....but, you could clearly see how fatty it was.  I feel the cook should of thrown away instead of serving it.  But, other than that the place is great and you should definetley try it.  KUDOS to BOA

Wow!   I will never visit this location again,   The employees were preparing food with bare hands!   They were wiping their foreheads of sweat and then touching food,   Absolutely disgusting!  I reported it to the manager who said they would remake our food,   No Thanks!!!

This place really is as good as it gets.   I don't really understand how anyone can give this place any less than 5 stars.   Lets start off with walking in.....The place is great...warm and cozy, beautifully decorated,  very clean.   The kitchen has the open glass view so you can see the kitchen staff working.   The hostesses are very attentive along with the wait staff.  You can tell the place has great management.  And now for the food.   Its delicious.   From the appetizers to desserts this place is 5 stars.   one main thing I love about WCG is that the food is always consistent.   I hate certain places where you order something and it comes out good one time and the second time it tastes different or not as good.   Not with WCG.  Its always great.   And the desserts are to die for.  Especially the white chocolate brownie.  I read a review on here where someone said "I know its the white chocolate grill, but cant they have something other than white chocolate for dessert"  How could you write that?  You go to a place called the white chocolate grill and your gonna complain about the white chocolate desserts?  Whats next?! are you gonna go to an italian restaurant and complain cuz they serve pasta?  Are you gonna go to a steakhouse and complain cuz they serve steaks?   Next time don't order dessert.   This place is fantastic.  Decor, ambiance, service, and Food.   A plus!

Sweet Potato Fries!  Yes, that's right.   The best!.   Moderately priced.  Nice local bar if you live close.   Has good food for being a bar.  Great happy hour most of the time.  The servers and bartenders are pretty friendly.  Cozy little spot.  I frequent this place often.   Don't tell my gfriend!!

I work close to this place so that's why i give it 5 stars.  Mostly for convenience.  On a hot summer day they have misters everywhere.  It's a place you can hang out with friends, bring a date, or bring the kids.  A great place to eat, hang out or shop.  I go all the time.  At least 3 times a week.  They have pretty much all the stores you look for in a regular mall.  Its clean and kept up with very well.  They also have a harkins theatre for going to the movies.  It's also in a great location next to the major freeways.  PLUS PLUS PLUS

Ive been here twice.   While the 1st time was a terrible experience I went back again seeing if the service and food had changed.  And It had.   I was happy.   The bread basket was delicious.  We ordered two of them.  haha.  And they bring out olive oil and garlic hot from a pan.  I thought it was a nice touch.   Definetely tasty.   I ordered the prosciutto and mushroom pasta with vodka sauce.  It was great.   Service has definetely gotten better as well.   They seem to have hired better help.   I hope this business does well and I will be back.

Ok look......when your Iphone breaks or cracks the screen....Lets face it....Going to Apple store is not on the list of what I call "Fun things to do".   The lines are way too long...cmon apple.  But, even though I love the iphone when it breaks down.   Imobile repair is there to help.  For $40 they fixed my phone after I had an accident where my phone went swimming.   (my bro pushed me in the pull while I had my phone in my pocket)   But for $40 my phone is back up and running.  Can't beat it.  Took about 45 minutes total....friendly service......It was great.  I will be back whenever I need help with my phone.   Thanks IMOBILE.

WOW.  So Im out with friends eating dinner right next to this place and we decided to stop in for yogurt.  As we pulled up to the place at 9:55 (they close at 10) The had the "Open" sign turned off.  So I said to my friend "They looked closed"  The girl at the store named Megan,  says very loudly "That's right a@*holes we're closed" and then she mumbles "Who pulls up to a yogurt shop right at closing time". As we stood there in disbelief her friends inside starting shooing us away.  We couldn't believe that just happened.  Especially seeing how we visit this place frequently because we live right across the street.  If I was the owner that girl would not work another day in that store.  Unbelievable.

I went here with girlfriend and her family last night.  It was a pleasant evening.  The casino hotel is pretty large.  Very nice decor.  I didn't feel it was that smoky.  Smoking goes right along with gambling, so don't think you will be able to avoid it.  These places are looking more and more like vegas everyday.  We ate at orange sky.  I thought it was delicious.  Loved the food.  Service was great.  Not as good as the new domenicks that just opened at the scottsdale quarter but darn close.  After eating we hit the tables.  I didn't do so well I lost $200.  But I won it all back playing keno.   $345.00  YEA!    I will be back soon.

This place has recently opened up in my neighborhood so me and some friends decided to check this place out after a weekend of boating out at lake pleasant (fun time).  When you walk in the place is nicely decorated.  We were quickly greeted at the front door.  We sat down with a server named Jimmy.  I can honestly say that in all my years of eating out, Jimmy is the best server I've ever had.  I always hate how servers are too attentive nowadays and sometimes it comes off as annoying.  I want to eat in peace and I hate how when your mouth is full chewing they come over and ask you how your meal is!  But not with Jimmy, He was perfect.  Now for the food....where do I start?  The raviolis are homeade and they literally melt in your mouth.  The ghnocci ( i think i spelled that correctly) was amazing.  Then I had the Creme Brulee.  Delicious!  Overall this place gets 5 stars.  And the bathrooms were pretty cool also.  The walls are made of some sort of Rock.  Very cool.

Hopefully the owners of this place read the reviews so they can fix the issues.   My girlfriend and Myself went here the other day.   Its a nice clean looking restaurant BUt, it is new...so that's probably why.   My gfriend is a restaurant manager at an upscale restaurant in scottsdale.   And she saw about 8 healthcode violations going on.  I give 2 stars because the manager gave us free drinks and he was polite.  And the food didnt taste that bad.   But.   The cooks were prepping food with the same gloves that they would touch your cooked food with.   They would touch the dirty towel and then touch your food.   The reason we saw all of this was because we sat at the bar.   The kitchen was open and you could see right inside.  Why they condone this kind of behavior and why the manager wasnt doing anything about it is beyond me.   The cooks never changed gloves. EVER.  the entire time they cooked everyones food they would use the same darn gloves.   CMON GUYS!  seriously?!!  Wake up.  Gross.
