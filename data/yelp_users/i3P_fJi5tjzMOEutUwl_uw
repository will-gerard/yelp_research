Just okay - seems to be a popular lunch place for folks working in the area.  The fries and potato salad were very good.  The sandwiches not so good.  We ordered the cheeseburger and club, both had no 'life' to them...

I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars...   Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!

Thanks to yelp we found this authentic Mexican restaurant... We were weary about the wait but it wasn't that bad.  The food came pretty quick - service from the wait staff was great, the hostess not so much.   So first you get some super spicy salsa with chips and already, there is a party in your mouth.  I ordered the Adovado ribs and it was ultra spicy and ultra good, literally melts in  your mouth and my buddy ordered the tacos (just okay)...  and I got a yummie Margarita - it was a night club in mouth and with the noise, seriously could not concentrate...   Very good - will return if we ever go back for Cubs Spring Training...

Fantastic! It took us four tries... My hubby tried looking for it before I arrived and was pointed to another mountain by a police officer.  Second time, we ended up driving up the residential area and that just made us felt small, we did end up watching the sunset though.  Third time, found the parking lot, but a long line of cars... Fourth time, got their 8 in the morning, waited (yes, there was a wait) for about five minutes, parked, and started our hike.  We bought two bottles of Gatorade with us in a plastic bag, I blame that on my husband.  Our plastic bag was full of holes with two big knots when we made it to the top.  Up was good for me but down was a bit scary, just didn't really trust my flat running shoes.  Didn't think we will climb a mountain while in PHX, but definitely go - people are super nice and it was alot of fun.  Don't be scared about the rating, it really is not that tough.    There is another trail, longer but less climbing, not sure where it starts though...   The addy is the intersection of McDonalds and Echo Canyon.

I must give them five stars... very reasonably prices (compared to Chicago).  Very yummie rolls from 6 to 10 dollars.  Love the clean decor and chill' ambiance.  I ordered their special Long Island Ice Tea - seriously a fusion drink with a hint of lychee and mango - so good and strong!
