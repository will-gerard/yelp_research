The food wasn't bad, but it did lack flavor. They have great lunch prices and fast service....but, I probably wouldn't go back.

I recently visited the Tempe Improv a couple of weeks ago to see Michael McDonald.  I was looking forward to seeing the changes made to the "new" Improv, but was incredibly disappointed, mostly with the service.  I truly enjoy getting out to a comedy show.  There's nothing more entertaining than a night out with friends laughing.  Makes for an amazing time.  I absolutely loved Michael McDonald and his opening act.  The comedy that night was fantastic....but that was where it ended.    It started with our server, who didn't even bring us water until at least halfway through the show.  A friend and I had to go up to the bar ourselves in order to get water for our table of 6.  I understand that it's hectic with all the tables being sat practically at once, but an establishment like this should be prepared and expect that sort of thing.  It is NOT ok to keep your paying customers waiting extensive amounts of time for anything, especially water.  As part of your 2 drink requirement, I would HIGHLY recommend that you get either beer or wine.  You'll get the most for your money from either of those options.  Their mixed drinks are not even worth mentioning.  A friend and I ordered a cosmo.  How can you go wrong with a cosmo, right?  Well....they successfully did.  It tasted like punch, and not even good punch, with absolutely NO alcohol.  I had asked our server how much the cosmo was, because there were no prices on the menu, and she had told me they were $11.   I was a little shocked to see a tiny martini glass not even full come out, knowing that I was going to have to pay $11 for this.  She had also asked if I wanted to upgrade, which I declined.  I noticed on the check that there was an extra $2 charge for an upgrade to Smirnoff.  1) How is Smirnoff an upgrade? 2) I said I didn't want an upgrade and 3) The fact that you're charging that ridiculous amount for a drink that didn't taste good and had no trace of alcohol in it is absolutely absurd.  The only good thing our server did was allow us to trade our drinks and order something new.  I ordered a long island, which was ok, but nothing close to what a long island should taste like.  It was a whole lot better than the ridiculous attempt at a Cosmo though.    I realize that these sort of outings are already going to be overpriced, but I don't expect to get such poor service.  Out of my group of 6, there was really only 1 meal that was enjoyed, which were the nachos.  Everything else was maybe adequate at the best.  I don't expect gourmet food at the improve, but I expect edible and decent food, since I am paying the overly priced rates.  The final straw that threw me overboard was the fact that EACH check was automatically charged 18% gratuity.  I used to be a server, so I normally tip about 20% for good service.  We didn't receive anything close to good service, and to be forced to pay 18% in GRATUITY (which means it should be left up to me on how much I WANT to give), is ridiculous.  The good servers at this establishment are missing out on at extra 2% and the customers are being ripped off for being required to tip a bad server way too much.    My experience at the "NEW" Tempe Improv was definitely less than desirable.  Like I said before, the comedy was the only good factor.  It makes it hard to want to go back when there are so many other options in town.  I will definitely have to rethink my decision to return, and will do only for a comedian worthwhile.  If I do return, I will be eating dinner somewhere else and only be ordering the required 2 drink minimum.

LOVE this place. The service is always wonderful, drinks super tasty, and food scrumptious. This has become our "usual" stop on theater night. Will keep going back.

The only reason I didn't give this place 1 star, was because they actually prepared my steak the temperature I ordered it. Otherwise, they do not deserve the 2nd star.  I read good reviews about this place, but was very disappointed (to say the lease) when I actually dined there this past Sunday.    The list of entrees was discounted for the summer, which was nice, but that didn't make up for their service.....or lack there of.  The only thing they delivered quickly was the bread basket.....everything else took a ridiculous amount of time.    The first question I had regarding cocktails, didn't help start us off on the right foot.  The menu states they have a cocktail of the day.  I inquired about it, which I was told that because they had a large party that was taking up the bartenders time, they didn't have on that day.  Excuse me?  Because your restaurant scheduled a large party, yet didn't have staff the rest of the restaurant accordingly, isn't my or any other customer's fault.  Strike 1.  The cocktail I did actually order....the bartender came back (after too much time) to finally let me know that they weren't able to make that drink....Strike 2.  The drinks aren't cheap here....$10 plus....and they came out in the tiniest glasses I've ever seen.  The prices they're charging for the "drink" that you receive isn't worth it.  I got a shot-sized drink.  I can go somewhere else and pay less for a decent sized drink with actual alcohol in it.  Not only were they expensive, but they took forever to get to us.  Our waiter apologized for the delay by saying..."the manager was at the bar watching and made the bartender nervous".  Excuse me?  Isn't this your job?  Isn't the manager supposed to come out and watch you every now and then?  I don't understand how that would prolong the making of our drinks????  Strike 3.  Our food didn't take horribly long to come out....and it wasn't bad.  My steak was prepared correctly, which a lot of restaurants fail to do. This gave them a couple points back....but not many.  It then took too long to finish the checkout process with our tab and whatnot.  With so many places to choose from.....I will most definitely not be returning.

I liked the country feel of this restaurant.  The service w a s a little slow....our server took forever to even take our orders.....but the food was not affected by this. My filet was prepared exactly as I ordered it....medium rare. It was mouth-watering. Great choice by a friend....looking forward to visiting again.

Really like the atmosphere here. I've only been twice....and have only had drinks.....but it's a cozy, friendly wine bar.

The service here was horrendous.  It's not that our server was bad, it's just that she hardly ever came back, even to take our order.  Dined here on a Wednesday night and they only had 1 server....she looked like she was working as both the server and bartender.  The wait times in between her coming back to our table were ridiculous.  We were sat and she came to take our drink order....but after that, I don't think we saw her again until the end.  One of our friends had to get up and go get who looked like to be the manager or owner to take our order, because we had already waited at least 20 minutes.  We finally order and then they're out of what I ordered, and wasn't told of this until after we placed our order.  The food was only ok.  For what I paid for the lamb.....it wasn't even juicy and lacked flavor.  My boyfriend did not like his quail at all.  From the time the plate was set down it looked like it was completely dry. ...and it was.  Had absolutely no flavor or anything to it.  He was not happy at all with it....especially for the price.    This place has potential, but with the service and cost for bad to decent food....we will be visiting other places over this one.

I'm not a big fan of this place to begin with....but a friend wanted to go to watch the basketball finals. Got the nachos.....definitely no good. I also ordered a Tangier a and tonic....Also no good. If you decide to go here....stick with the wings. Otherwise....I recommend that you don't come here. I won't be back.

Went there with a group of friends last weekend (January 10, 2014) to see Joe Rogan, and was unsure how it was going to be, because of previous bad experiences at the Tempe Improv.  But....We had a fantastic time.  The show was amazing and our server was outstanding.  She was definitely on top of things.  She approached me and took my drink order the second I sat down.  We didn't have to wait long for drinks or food.  My group did the dinner package so that way we could have reserved seats....that's definitely the way to go.  It's not very expensive, the food is tasty, and it covers your two drink minimum.  It does tend to become a pretty pricey evening the moment you order an alcoholic beverage though....their drinks seem to be an average of $15.....but, you have to be prepared for that when going out to an evening like this.  They have a great line-up of comedians.....we will definitely be back :)

Joined a friend for dinner there last night (Mother's Day). This place was fantastic. Aside from our server being a little slow at getting back to us for our order....the service was great.  I never had to ask to have my water glass filled.....which is a huge problem at most places. My friend and I split the swordfish special and the sirloin plate.....which were both cooked magnificently.  The swordfish just melted in your mouth and the sirloin was probably the best sirloin I've had. It was freezing cold in the restaurant.....but, that was the only uncomfortable factor. This has been added to my fave steakhouses

I still think they're great....I used to go here when they were at their old location in Tempe on McClintock/Broadway and continue to go when I can.  They would have received 5 stars, but the service we received from our server wasn't so great.  We had a friend in from out of town, and wanted to show him this place, because I really enjoy the food and the family atmosphere.  The thing he orders is apparently not being served anymore at the restaurant (along with 2 other items), but our server failed to mention this to us when we sat and she brought us menus.  She finally informed us of this menu change AFTER our friend ordered this and said....Oh, I should have told you before.  You think?  That would have been helpful information.  Our friend had to now find something new, so asked what the soup of the day was.....to which, she didn't know. She had to go find out. We didn't get iinto the restaurant until closer to 8pm....so she would have almost worked an entire shift by then.  She most definitely should have known at that point.  I used to serve, and to me this laziness (or whatever it was) isn't acceptable.  I know that this isn't how the restaurant is typically run....at least from the other times that I've been in.  This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  The food was still delicious....especially the poutine and rosti (love those items), but the service could definitely use some revamping.

Went here for dinner Easter Sunday with my parents.  None of us had been before, and wanted to try out a new steakhouse.  It looked nice, and the hostess (who was also the manager) was very friendly and sat us.  The restaurant itself is set up nicely....I don't think the atmosphere is all that cozy, but it's still a nice place.    The food wasn't very good at all.  I ordered the filet with cheese and bacon.  In the menu, there's a little table that shows and explains the difference between the temperatures (Medium-lightly pink...etc).  I ordered my filet medium rare....like I do at every place.  I told our server that I'd like it more on the rare side than the medium side.  She explained the table to me, which I already understood, but know that restaurants tend to still overcook even with a type of guide.  She said it'll come out medium rare.  It came out medium.....very little pink, if any.  It still tasted fine, but it bothers me when a restaurant focuses on that and can't even get it right.  I know it was the kitchen, and not our server, but it's the fact that she pointed it out to me and it still wasn't right.    My mom's lamb was completely overcooked as well.  Our server asked when she ordered it if it was ok that they were served medium.  They looked more medium well and one of them was even burned on the outside.  My dad...who loves steak, wasn't all that pleased with his meal either, which is rare for him.  The bread they bring out to the tables, along with the vegetables we ordered as our sides, were the only things that tasted good.    We needed to try it out, because how else do you know if you like a place.....but we all agreed that we definitely will not be back.  With so many places to choose from, this one is not worth it.  I was hugely disappointed.

Went with a group of friends a couple months back on a Saturday afternoon. The service was spot-on and the food was delicious.  My friends and I enjoyed our time there out on the patio. Will be back to dine again.

Love this place.  Great atmosphere and fantastic food.  The seafood is actually super tasty and the flavoring is spot on.  A great place to enjoy not only your company, but your meal.  Everything we had there was delicious.  Be ready to get dirty though....you eat with your hands.  It adds so much to the restaurant.

Dined here a couple weeks after it opened. I loved this place. It's small, with a great atmosphere.....the patio view outside is a nice addition. The service was great and the food was delicious. Will definitely be back.

Visited this place a few weeks ago with a friend....it was the first time there for both of us.   This place was all around fantastic.  Our server, I believe his name was Josh, was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly from the first time he came up throughout the entire dinner.    Our waters were constantly filled....which is a huge deal to me.  We had their bacon guacamole, a shishito roll, some tasty crab noodle dish, their tacos,salmon nigiri....all delicious and would have them again.  They had great flavors and some fun new things to try. The peach margarita was one of the best I've had.  It was actually frozen like a smoothie....it didn't melt in a minute.  We sat at the sushi bar, which is nice if you're in a group of 2.  The manager came by and was super courteous and talked a few minutes with us.  We complemented our waiter...it was all around great service and a wonderful dining experience.  We both agreed that we'd be back :)

Revisited for dinner and had a fabulous evening.  Our server (I believe his name was Mark???) was spot on.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, courteous, and never let any of our drinks go empty.  I truly appreciate good service like this, which is what my last visit was severly lacking.  The food was spectacular....everything we had, from the margaritas to the octopus nigiri.  I love their selection of delicious foods offered and will continue to revisit this great restaurant.

I give it a 2 for our overall experience....which was mainly due to poor service.  If it was just based on food...I'd give it a 3.  Let me start by saying....I love Switch, Fez, and Bliss Rebar, and have always had great food and service at each of those places......that made me really excited about trying this place out.  I heard a few good reviews about it, but was very disappointed when I finally tried it last night.    I made a reservation for my group of 9.  We were going to go see a play at the Phoenix Theater that night, and my normal routine includes going to Switch prior to the play.  This time, I wanted to switch it up in order to finally try Corduroy.  We got there and were seated, and our server was a very polite girl, but that's about it.  Her server skills completely lacked.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had.  I used to be a server, so I will give her a little bit of slack.  The one thing she did well was make sure the vases of water were always full.  I love when a server is aware of everyone's water, and she did that.  Everything else was far from being good.  It started with her taking our orders.  She went around in a circle, which is completely fine, but she did it TWICE!!!!  The first time she took our order, and then the second time she asked me "What did you order again?"  She hadn't even left our table to key in our order yet.....she made the second circle around the table immediately after she did the first round to initially get our order.  She shouldn't have to ask our entire table AGAIN....especially RIGHT AFTER she just took our order.    Our food took a ridiculous amount of time to come out.  We were on a tighter schedule with our time, but I allowed plenty of time.....and even had some extra time just in case.  Good thing I did, because we used every last minute, plus some, that I had allowed for dinner to get to the theater in time.  The food was descent.....nothing special.  I got the Croque Monsieur Tartine at the recommendation of our server.  It was good....but nothing amazing like she had stated.  I also asked if it was possible to order a side of the mac and cheese, because me and my boyfriend like to try the mac and cheese everywhere we go to do taste comparisons.  She said that we could do that, which was great.  Another friend ended up getting a side of mac and cheese as well, because she told us that it could only be added as a side to sandwiches.    When the food came out, we had issues with the mac and cheese.  Two of us had ordered it as a side, and one of us had ordered the actual entree.  All 3 that they brought out looked exactly the same.  The entree was significantly more expensive than the side....and they still charged our one person the entree price, when it was clearly not an entree.  At this point, my whole group was pretty irritated with how long it took to get our meals....and there was one gentleman who placed another drink order and never received the drink.  She asked if we were all on one tab, and we explained to her who was together and who was separate.  We had to tell her this at least 3 times....maybe even 4.  I was beyond frustrated, and we were running very low on time.  She brought out the checks all mixed up.....and charging full price for the one mac and cheese.  Her explanation on why they were being charged full price, was because they don't normally do sides of mac and cheese, so gave us all the same thing (but didn't charge us all the same amount).  The explanation made absolutely no sense to me.  They ended up adjusting that, which they should have, because we didn't receive the entree like what was ordered.  What bothered me even more, was the fact that she's now telling us that they don't do mac and cheese sides, when she made it well known earlier when taking our order that they could only add the mac and cheese as a side to a sandwich order.  She clearly didn't know what she was talking about.  I would have been fine without getting the side, all she had to do was say it wasn't offered.  We had to have her move a couple of items on a couple of checks, and when she came back with the revised checks, not only did she move the items we told her, but she moved several other items as well.  Since we had no time left, we all just paid so we could get out.  When she brought back our final receipts, after swiping our cards for payment, our totals were different once again.  I couldn't believe it.  I never once had any trouble as a server splitting the checks for tables......especially 2 or 3 times on the same check.  It was beyond ridiculous.  It's safe to say, that I will most likely not be dining here again.  The food wasn't worth putting up with the service.  I will stick to Switch.
