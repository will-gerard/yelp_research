Stay away from this store!!!  If I could give negative stars, I would.  Heck, they don't even deserve any stars...how about bad apples instead?  The service is horrible; I knew the employees would suck when I saw how sad and angry they looked.  It doesn't matter which department you are shopping, the workers look like they would be happier holding a business sign outside on a street corner in 115 degree weather, compared with working at this Staples.    My husband bought a canister for our Soda Stream and he didn't realize it was empty until 5 days later.  When I explained it to the sales clerk, he called for the assistant manager named Sampson (yes, that was his real name, and no, Goliath was not there).  Sampson became defensive, sanctimonious, and belittling towards me.  He told me that he could get a new one and have me hold them so that I could tell the difference.  I told him I am not stupid, and that I know the difference already.  Sampson said to call Soda Stream and complain; he wouldn't return my money.  He said that I could be anyone "off the street" trying to return an empty canister that I had used, which wasn't the case, as I  told him, and to look at my receipt, which he refused to do.    I explained that someone at his store sold us a USED canister and that we didn't realize it until we went to use it today.  I had the receipt from 3 weeks ago (my husband had given me the wrong receipt) but Sampson didn't even look at it.  He repeatedly said that he is protecting his job and the sales clerk that had waited on me originally.  I walked out of the store.  I returned to Staples with the correct receipt about 15 minutes later and showed it to Sampson.  Once again, he didn't look at it.  Instead, he immediately said, "I thought we settled this when you were in here the last time."  He's lucky I didn't tell him off then.  We went round and round, he repeated the same crap about protecting his job, he talked down to me, and he rarely made eye contact.    When I told Sampson that he was belittling me and made me feel stupid, he made some stupid excuses, all the while avoiding any eye contact, which told me he is full of it.  I told him loudly that no wonder nobody shops there...Perhaps the ONE OTHER SHOPPER in the  store heard me.  THIS STORE SUCKS!!!  I am surprised that it is still open...for now.

Wonderful experience!  The food is amazing: tasty, steaming hot, and inimitable.  The service is great, too;  we always get a table quickly, are waited on immediately, and they always pay extra attention to us.. In fact, we go once or twice a month and now know the owners, who are very friendly.  And they even know us by name, which comes in handy when we happen to place phone orders.   Before you even order, they start you off with hot tea, if you desire.  After we place our order, the soup is served piping hot, with those amazing crunchy pieces to put in the soup, or, as my young son does, to dip in the red sauce often used for egg rolls.  And speaking of egg rolls, Dragon Palace has the best egg rolls I have ever tasted anywhere.  Their entrees are exceptional and huge; we always have a "doggy bag" for leftovers when we leave.  The atmosphere is conducive to what you should get at a Chinese restaurant, with decorations, lighting, and music.  One time, when the music was not Asian sounding, my son asked the owners to change it to their usual music, and they did as he requested.  Dragon palace is the best Chinese restaurant anywhere.

We LOVE this restaurant!  My son, husband, and I went here last week after not visiting it for several years.  It was well worth it!  My son was starving and ordered french fries, spaghetti, pasta, pizza, and pancakes (typical nine year-old fare), and it was inexpensive.  He tasted what my husband and I ordered (the roast beef (him) and a veggie omelette (me).  We left with plenty of leftovers, full bellies, and three satisfied customers who did not spend a lot of money.  Well worth a visit.

FILTHY!!  UNORGANIZED!!!    This place went downhill compared with when we visited last year.  We went for the Homeschool Day on October 9, 2015, and it was disappointing overall.  While last year they offered 1 to 2 hour classes for the kids at an extra cost, there were none available this year, so it didn't seem as informative.  The schedule seemed put together at the last minute.  I had some questions, so I emailed and left a message for S. Schuck before Homeschool Day, but she/he never returned my messages.  When I phoned back one final time, the guy who answered had no clue about Homeschool Day.    For Homeschool Day, they were supposed to hold a free class on information about comets and how to make them, and then let the kids make a comet themselves.  When no teacher showed up after 15 minutes, I called the front desk and they had no clue that no employee was there teaching the class.  A few minutes later a female employee walked into the room and said that she was just told that she was teaching the class, but she had to look for materials.  After about 5 more minutes, she "taught" the class like this: She put dry ice in a big garbage bag and hit it with a hammer, then she added window cleaner, pounded some more, and ureka...the comet is made.  That was it!  What a waste of time!!!  In the STEM room, it looked like not much thought was put into the experiments; several of them did not work.       Also, the place was FILTHY, especially the cafe, such as it was.  All of the tables chairs, counters, and floor were filthy.

They are out of business!  My son and I really loved this place, and we were both disappointed to find that it was empty.  They are putting (yuk) Chipotle in its place.

My husband and I were married at Har Zion in 2003, when the membership was flourishing.  Today, their membership is really low, and not many young families are members.  It would be great if younger families at least attended services.  Babysitting is available the first and third Shabbat morning.  My son and I attend fairly regularly.  They are the only synagogue in the area that offers daily minyans twice daily.. More people need to be present for that though.  Please help by attending minyan  at least once a month.  Hopefully the incoming new rabbi will help bring in younger, newer members to help grow this synagogue.

VERY disappointing experience!  VERY unsanitary!  We usually do take out because the prices are so high; they decreased portions after raising their already high menu prices.  And they tend to cut corners, like a veggie omelette that had mostly onions.  Gross!   Recently, my son and I went there for take out of his usual french fries and Elmo cupcake.  After standing by the cash register for a couple of minutes, I yelled, "Hello!  Is anybody here."  A woman finally emerged with a disgusted look on her face and said, "Yeah."  I gave my order of french fries and an Elmo cupcake.    When she grabbed the cupcake WITHOUT using gloves or tissue paper, I told her to use both and asked why she wasn't using either one.  She gave me another angry look and said, with a patronizing and disgusted tone, "Because I don't need them!"  I told her to get her manager, and while we waited, another customer who witnessed this told me that he is an Assistant Manager at a restaurant and that she violated health codes (besides being rude)!    After the manager emerged, the rude clerk snapped at another customer and then walked by while using her cell phone.  I told the manager what happened and he apologized but didn't look surprised.  He said that he would talk with her.  When I asked if she was a family member or friend of the owners, he said no.  By the way, we were NOT COMPENSATED for this woman's rudeness.  I will NOT return to Chompies.  THEY SUCK!!!

HORRIBLE!  DIRTY!  It was my first, and last, visit to Chipolte restaurants anywhere.  The first thing I did was ask the employees if the food was spicy, and of course they said no,'but they could make it spicy.  I told them I am wimpy and don't like food spicy at all, and my son cannot eat spicy hot either.  They told me not to worry, that they make it spicy.  WRONG!  It was so spicy neither my son nor I could eat it.  So I excused myself and went to the bathroom, and on my short walk back to the table, I saw a live ROACH on its back.  I immediately lost my appetite.' The only one who ate the food was my husband, who said it was o.k.  When I asked for to-go containers (for my husband) the employee who had just handled the dirty money, dug his hands in the containers and handed them to me.  So I asked the employees who were making the food (and were wearing gloves) to get them.   My husband didn't even eat the food we took home; even he lost his appetite after all of that.

Do NOT visit this restaurant.  There is a reason why there are not a lot of people in this place, which made my alarms go off but I went there anyway.  I was going to go to Habit Burger next door but they were overcrowded and I was super hungry so I went to Garbanzo.  BIG MISTAKE!  The falafel balls were overcooked, burnt, and disgusting. They were really dry and inedible.  It is obvious that the oil in the fryer was way over needing changed.  The pita was also not fresh; it was hard and dry, too.  They mixed all of the items together in the flimsy container.  As far as the employee who waited on me, she didn't use the utensils she was supposed to use.  I thought it was odd that she used her hands to give me lettuce,  although she had on latex gloves (yes, there were utensils there at her disposal...readily available).  In hindsight, I really should have gone to Habit Burger next door.  There is a reason they are more crowded than Garbanzos...where I won't be back.
