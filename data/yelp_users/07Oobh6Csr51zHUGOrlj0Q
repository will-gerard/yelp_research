Cobblestone Auto Spa is like going to a car dealership and having the car dealers rip you off on some sales pitch saying, "you need yours transmission flush, new air filters, etc..,and all you were wanting to begin with was an oil change. Bad service with this place, they left my coolant lid off. By the time I drove home, all of the coolant liquid was gone, had to buy new coolant liquid and refill it myself. Ladies beware, before trying this place make sure you're knowledgeable about car maintenance those mechanics will try to sell you an overprice deal, not worth it!

Two words: Vermicelli Salad! Fresh, fulfilling and extremely delicious!! I highly suggest to try it along side a natural fruit smoothie or tea with boba! You'll drift off into Bomboba heaven! Every time I go into Bomboba the energy the Staff give off is always warm and welcoming! Don't forget your punch card!!:)
