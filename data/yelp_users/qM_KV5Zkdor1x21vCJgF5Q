Typical subway, sandwiches were alright, the service was really slow, there was only one person doing the sandwiches for some reason....

The chicken bowl is my go to meal at chipotle, it never lets me down, chicken was delicious and juicy, the salsa was nice and hot, and the lettuce was crunchy and fresh. Love it!

One of the best customer service here in Scottsdale. The waiting folks made us feel at home as soon as we sit down..the food was good and we just love the atmosphere here.... My favorite dish is their enchiladas....

My friend recommended me to go here to get my manicure done and to my surprise this salon is actually not bad! The tech working on me did such a fine job on my nails! Each one of my nails looked absolutely mesmerizing! By far the best services I've received from a nail salon! I highly recommend coming here to get your manicure done! You won't regret it one bit!

OMG!!! Great experiences here today. These ladies were friendly and knew exactly what their customers needed. They served me with great care and smiling faces and it made me feel very happy. I had Luxury Pedicure and honestly i haven't had such a relaxing Pedicure like this in a long time. My tech was very patient and attentive. She took time to make sure i was completely satisfied and gave me beautiful looking nails. So loved it! The price i paid was totally worth it. The place itself was pretty clean and well organized. I will recommend this place to all my friends and definitely be back soon!
