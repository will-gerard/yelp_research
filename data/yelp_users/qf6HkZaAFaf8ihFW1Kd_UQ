The Lost Leaf has a large selection of bottled brews. No matter what night of the week you go you'll find something playing live whether its a band, or a live dj set, or a live rap performance. It's a good place to chill alone or bring friends and it's next to some good eats on the weekends.

I've never had a waxing experience and this halloween I needed to trim up my unmentionables for a costume. I googled male brazilian and this was the second hit. It was five dollars cheaper, had the option to schedule online, and on top of that was half off for the first visit. After an evening of watching youtube videos and expecting the worst, I was quite surprised that ,although still painful, the speed and efficiency of D'Lisa (I was in and out in approx 25 minutes total)  made the experience monumentaly more pleasant than I'd thought possible. Upon arriving I was offered a choice of beverages and was greated warmth and candor. D'Lisa was also very personable during the whole procedure making small talk and offering suggestions. I found it really helped me take my mind off of the whole ordeal which probably helped to lessen the percieved pain. Despite being fast she still paid attention to detail pulling out tweezers to get those few stubborn hairs. If you are a newbie looking to try out waxing or a seasoned glutton for punishment waxaholic. I couldn't think of how other places could improve on the experience.

I'd like to give them one star, but they did the job I asked them to. When I got the bike back I noticed my cyclometer sensor on the rear wheel was broken and not screwed on any longer. They did provide me tools so I could try to tighten it back up. One of my bike water cages had the plastic retention portion broken off of it. My front brake was not properly tightened. They tightened up the brake, after making a joke about that being how they get repeat business. If you need a 1 inch fork threaded, cut, and  you have no other option come to Tempe bicycle. just make sure you inspect your equipment when you leave. Did they do the job? Yes. Was it affordable? Yes. Would I come back? No. Would I recommend? I'd recommend them for threading and cutting the fork, that's it. Receiving my bicycle with sensors out of place, brakes not ready, seat raised from where it was originally (by 6 inches), and a broken water cage makes me reluctant to return.

This place has bar none some of the best tasting hamburgers I've ever had. They have a simple menu, but you can basically ask them to tailor make you whatever. 99c sliders are plenty big, after 3 or so and a beer I'm full. If you're a fan of PBR (I'm not) you can have some pretty cheap eats and drinks. The sliders taste more like burgers than sliders. I rated it 5 stars despite the fact that sometimes they won't cook my burgers rare. It just depends on who is cooking that day. Even when it does happen they've offered to replace the burger, but I always decline as the burgers are delicious anyway. They've recently begun serving a modest amount of liquor. Servings for their menu burgers are not small, expect to eat and feel full. I'm going to address the atmosphere issue someone pointed out. If I wanted candle lit dinners and impeccable presentation would I go to burgers and bottles? No, but then again I'd probably be in the mood for foie gras or something if that was my style. Is it empty, yes can't fault that observation, although lately it's becoming a bit livelier. Is the sun bothersome? Yes, if you are a vampire or have sensitive eyes. Should you take what I say with a grain of salt? Maybe, I did use the ten second rule in a few third world countries. This place is awesome and you should check it out, I wouldn't make it a habit unless you don't mind being a chubby funster like me.

The owner and staff were very attentive. The food was delicious from the appetizers to the desert. Portions are substantial so come hungry or don't over order as I did.
