This store is a disaster. It is always in a state of complete disarray. The staff is rarely helpful, typically pretty rude, which in my experience isn't the norm for other stores. It seems that more products are out of stock than in stock, things have been opened and gouged, swatches destroyed and crumbling everywhere and not usable, and things are never put back where they go. Obviously a lot of that is due to the customers, as obviously employees aren't going around doing that sort of thing, but they're not cleaning up after it either. Honestly if I want to shop at Ulta I will go way out of my way to another store or just buy online to avoid this place. I tend to leave angry more often than happy because my experience is almost always negative.

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT GET YOUR HAIR CUT HERE!!! If I could leave a 0 star review I would, but I'll give it 1 star for the girl who ended up fixing my hair. I came in to this Fantastic Sams hoping to get my waist-length hair trimmed at the ends, and my long layers freshened up. I told the stylist I wanted to keep as much of the length as possible and freshen up my layers to give me a little more volume and ease when curling my hair. Mind you, at this point I have been growing my hair out over 5 years to get it to this length. Besides some minor highlights, I've treated my hair exceptionally well in order to maintain as much health as possible. I was finally happy with the length and was hoping from here on out would be maintenance cuts.   The girl who cut my hair absolutely BUTCHERED it. As she started cutting I sensed something was wrong because there was SO much hair on the floor, and she was cutting in all different directions, not at all how my layers had EVER been cut before (many MANY times at FS, and a few high-end salons). Typically, they pull your hair above your head and cut at an angle. There was none of that happening, there seemed to be no method or logic to what she was doing. I nervously asked at one point how much she was taking off (as I had SPECIFICALLY stated I wanted the LEAST AMOUNT POSSIBLE off the length) and she said only about 1" off the length, but that the layers were 5" shorter than the longest layer. Again, I was very nervous and upset at this point because that WASN'T what I wanted, but what could I possibly do now? I let her finish it up, paid, and left, and went home sobbing to dry it to see if the atrocity on my head looked any better dry (spoiler alert: it didn't).  As I dried it, I realized my longest layer now consisted of what appeared to be ~20 individual strands of hair, and the other layers all stopped right around my collarbone/jawline with NO blending down to the lowest layer. It was something along the lines of a rat's tail and the "scene" haircut girls used to get where they essentially had a bob haircut on top of one veeeeeery thin much longer layer. NOT what I wanted, and not a good look.  I returned to the salon, sobbing, and asked that someone fix my hair PLEASE because I can't possibly do anything with this to make it look presentable. Another girl, whose name escapes me (I think maybe Sarah, I wish I could remember), took me to fix my hair. I would go back to see her again as she did the best possible she could with what hair I had, and was very kind, but I think if I ever step foot in that place again I might have a complete mental breakdown. To start, she had to cut a decent amount off the length to even get close to the next longest layer, what I would say was 4" or so. Then, she blended in the layers with the technique I described above (bringing the hair to the top of the head and cutting at an angle) and as she did, it was pretty obvious what a shit job I'd had done as the hair wasn't in any particular pattern. Some pieces had a curved half-circle shape to them, some pieces were angled the wrong way, some were "W" and "WVV" and so on jagged shapes. There was no rhyme or reason to it, only further proving that my hair was a disaster.  All-in-all, I think I walked away with ~10" of hair gone. My waist-length hair is now to my bra strap, and although much better than before, I still have some awkward volume layers that hit around my collar bone and don't have a great "blend" into the longer layers. There's only so much she could do.  So, in summary, I am heartbroken and devastated. Anyone who has taken a long time to grow out their hair would understand the feeling of not only having a bad haircut, but losing so much length they now must spend YEARS regrowing. Add to that the fact that I will need quite a few more maintenance cuts to even out these layers as they grow out. All-in-all, this was the absolute worst hair experience I have ever had. While I don't think the girl who cut my hair initially should be fired or anything, she needs some SERIOUS re-training on what I would assume are fairly basic tenants of hair-styling (listen to your client, get more clarification on what they want if you're not clear, cutting layers, etc.) before being allowed near anyone else's head. As for the girl who fixed my hair, you are a saint, thank you for being so understanding as I wept when you had to cut more length off my hair and as I sat silently while you chatted away because it took everything in me to not sob more. I've since cried many times at home and in stores and other public places when I see girls with long beautiful hair that reminds me of what I lost that day.  Also, as an aside, the girl who fixed my hair took my phone number to have a manager contact me about what had happened, as this apparently is customary in situations like this, and now a week later I have not hear back... Not great customer service in that regard.

OBSESSED with the orange blossom wheat beer. I made my friends come all the way down here for it. Good service, good beer, we didn't order food so I can't say much for that, but if I ever leave AZ I'll have to come back to buy beer to take with me.

The food is relatively good but the wait staff makes it not worth it. I've been here quite a few times and they've always been rude, but honestly tonight I got to the point where I just won't eat there anymore. We came when they were busy, which I understand, but it took a ridiculous amount of time to seat us. Then they brought out waters and promptly forgot about us. For 30 minutes. Took making eye contact to get some help, and once we did it was snappy help. The food came out quickly but then once I went to pay (at this point we waited so long we were the last people there and they were mopping the floors... Couldn't that wait until we left so we don't slip and fall?) the woman behind the counter was totaling the receipts for the day in the register and didn't acknowledge me. No "I'll be right with you" or "just one second" she just straight up did not acknowledge my presence. So I left the exact amount in cash and got the heck out of there. I will never go back. I'm not going to come waste my hard earned money on rude service. I'll find someone with better food and a better attitude.

Mastro's is a classic, and pretty much speaks for itself. Everything is luxurious from the napkins to the food to the decor and ambiance. Came here for a work dinner and got some funny looks for being in scrubs, but the food was out of this world delicious and the wine was fantastic. The dessert was to die for, they didn't miss a single detail. The main dining area is a bit dark for my liking, it's tough to see the other people in your party, but I guess it's all in the "mood lighting." All in all you can't ever go wrong with Mastro's for sure.

The shrimp tacos and fish tacos are delicious! Since working in Orange County, CA I have become obsessed with shrimp and fish tacos. This may come as a surprise, but up until a few months ago I had never had a fish taco in my life... Never had any kind of taco besides beef or fish! Crazy, right?! Since coming to the OC I have been eating shrimp and shrimp tacos like it is going out of style, now I can see what all the fuss is about fish tacos, and I'm hooked! This is the first place I have found in AZ that has fish tacos (besides Del Taco, which obviously just can't compare) and they did not disappoint. The flavor was perfect, the price was right, and I drowned everything in a healthy dose of fresh squeezed lime. It was pure bliss!

Probably the best pedicure I've had in Glendale. Super fast, and a great price. The place was clean, the staff was very nice, and they did a fantastic job. Plus, since two of us came in and got pedicures at the same time they gave us a voucher to come back. The gel nail polish is $22 or $20 M-W, which is a great price. Would definitely come back again and recommend to anyone in the area!

Came here for my two year anniversary at the suggestion of some of the doctor's I worked with. I figured if they, Scottsdale docs, liked it then it must be good. Everything about this place comes off as trying too hard. The other patrons were one step away from Ed Hardy t-shirts and rhinestone jeans, and a table of spoiled brat Scottsdale high schoolers being obnoxious and howling over stupid shit definitely put a damper on the mood. However, as the restaurant can't help who eats there, I didn't hold it against them. The music was deafeningly loud, and as it was our anniversary I would have liked to enjoy some conversations, but that was not happening. The food was sub-par, and considering that it was ridiculously expensive, it was not worth it at all. Very underwhelming all in all, next time I'll stick to one of the classics and not waste my money shooting for trendy and disappointing.
