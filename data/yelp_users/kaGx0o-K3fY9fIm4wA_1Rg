Royal Taj is the best Indian food there is. I didn't like Indian food until I came here with my wife a few years ago. This is one of our favorite restaurants of all time. We have tried Indian food all over town and in a few other cities and they all fall short when compared to Royal Taj. Royal Taj has the best basmati rice. Their garlic naan is always fresh and looked forward to. Every dish is amazing. Their Marsala and their korma are what we order the most. The sauces and gravies are rich and flavorful. The paneer tiki is a wonderful dish, as is the saag paneer as they both have amazing paneer cheese with a wonderful flavor and perfect texture. They have a full bar and great Indian beers as well as other import beers. This is real Indian food made by a nice Indian family. They even adjust the spiciness of each dish to your order.  We always stick with the medium spice.  If you go to the lunch buffet everything will be of a mild spice, but you can always order an entree for lunch instead of the buffet if you want it spicier.  My wife is a vegetarian and I'm a big meat eater and we both have allot to choose from here.  Long story short, if you like Indian food, Royal Taj is for you.  If you don't like Indian food, Royal Taj is also for you because any other Indian food you have had probably paled in comparison to Royal Taj.  Royal Taj will make you a fan of Indian food.

It says a lot when a meat eater like myself will visit this vegan restaurant again and again. I have never had a bad meal here. Everything has been great from the original G spicy po' boy to the no harm chicken parm or the big wac that is a vegan take on the McDonald's Big Mac. They have salads, sandwiches, burgers, pitas, and all types of food from American to Asian, to Italian and more. They cary the best micro brewed sodas i have ever had. The prices are very reasonable and the employees are always very nice and give great customer service. Today I had Wendy's Pickle which is a breaded mock chicken cutlet with southern style spicy mayo and dill pickles.  The bread is so soft and delicious you would never guess it was made without milk or eggs. The cutlet looks and tastes so much like chicken that you don't miss the chicken at all. Add in the spicy and creamy mayo, and pickles and you have a fantastic lunch that would make anyone jealous wether they are vegan, vegetarian or a carnivore. The dish is served with thyme fries, tahini coleslaw or fresh fruit. I got the fries this time but I have tried the other sides and they are also great. The fries are long shoe string fries that are perfectly fried and have the best potato flavor with a crispy yet soft texture that makes you want to slam them in your face to keep the happiness going as long as possible. My total bill was $9.25 after tax. My vegetarian wife turned me (her meat loving husband) onto this place and I have come here more times without her than I have with her. That is how good this place is. It is an unpretentious restaurant with quality food. You will love it!

I came to Tott's for lunch. They have an open kitchen area which can be fun if you like to watch the food being prepared, however I found it odd that while I saw food being prepared I didn't smell anything. I am used to walking by a restaurant and being tempted to enter because of the delicious smell of the food they being prepared there. I went to the counter and ordered the orange chicken they seem to be famous for. The total was $6.82 which seemed reasonable. I sat down and was quickly served in a matter of a few short minutes.  My dish was served on an oval shaped platter. The orange chicken was on one side and the other side was a large helping of white rice. The dish had large pieces of chicken sitting in a large pool of orange sauce. The orange sauce had many pieces of red pepper flakes and other spices I couldn't identify. There were five or six large red and black peppers to add some spice to the dish. The chicken was not over breaded like you might expect from places like Panda Express, but the sauce was overly sweet. The sauce seemed to have a thicker consistency to it like a syrup. The five or six large peppers were a welcomed relief from the sweetness of the dish but they ran out fast. The spices and pepper flakes in the sauce didn't translate into flavor on my tongue. Im usually a big fan of orange chicken but was very disappointed in it overall and would not order it again. The owner was there and seemed very friendly, thanking every customer as they left. I saw some other food being prepared as I left and I can tell they were making an honest effort to make good food here. I saw that they were roasting their own peanuts, for example, instead if just opening a package of ingredients and tossing it in the mix. Unfortunately, my experience today didn't equate to the dining experience I had hoped for. It was just way too sweet and lacking flavor.

I went to Pei Wei for some orange chicken.  They have an open kitchen area, a counter to order at, and a large seating area.  They also have a special door and counter area for take-out orders.  The orange chicken was $9.00 after tax.  The orange chicken here is very different than other recipes I've had but it is good.  The chicken is very lightly glazed in an orange sauce that is not overly sweet like some places (see my review of Tott's).  The chicken is accompanied by slivers of orange peal, soft thinly sliced carrots, crisp snow peas and a little bit of green onion and bean sprouts.  I appreciate the fact that I can taste the tender chicken because it is not deep fried.  The orange flavor is there but it is not overpowering.  The vegetables are a welcomed change of pace from the usual orange chicken than is just deep fried chicken in a sugary sauce.  I do miss the spicy kick of the orange chicken recipes that have red and black peppers, but I also realize that would screw up THIS recipe because it would overpower the other flavors.  I feel like I am eating healthier when I am eating this dish from Pai Wei and yet I am satisfying my craving for orange chicken.  Overall, I am satisfied with this experience.  You pay a little more for this orange chicken than you might at Tott's or Panda Express but you get what you pay for.

This restaurant is a great value and has good service. My wife and I came here for lunch and we both got full for $15 and some change before leaving a tip. We both got lunch specials that started off with egg drop soup. The egg drop soup had peas and carrots and corn in it, which is different but still did nothing for me.  For our entrees I got a red curry chicken dish and my wife got an eggplant dish with tofu that she read good things about. When you order they have you rate how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1 to 10. We both requested a level 6 out of 10 spiciness. The dishes came in a short amount of time with one small egg roll each, some sweet and sour sauce on the side, and some white rice. The egg rolls were ok. So far I wasn't impressed but then I tasted the entree and was pleased. My red curry had great curry and coconut flavor to it with just the right amount of spice. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. The chicken was just a little dry but it was all white meat so that is probably why. My wife's eggplant and tofu dish was great too. The tofu was not deep fried (which I like) and it had just the right texture and firmness to it. Normally i don't like tofu but this was good. The sauce was very tasty and different.  The eggplant was very well done. It is easy to screw up eggplant but this was just right. It wasn't bitter like eggplant can be sometimes and it wasn't too soft or mushy. The vegetables in this dish were equally as good as the ones in my dish. My wife's dish seemed hotter than mine but that is probably because of the coconut milk in my dish masking the heat. I would probably back off to a number 5 or even 4 spiciness on dishes without coconut milk in the future. When we paid our tiny bill we learned about their rewards program where your fifth entree is free! This is great. This is the first sit down restaurant with waiter service that I have heard of that has a reward card. It is a great value and we are already half way to a free entree! Sign me up for that!

Baratin is a small restaurant in Scottsdale with an amazing chef. The restaurant is Baratin at lunch time and FnB for dinner. I was here for the Batatin lunch which has a constantly changing menu because they only use fresh, local, organic ingredients. The menu is very short for lunch (only six items on the menu when you include the desert) and much longer for the FnB dinner.  It doesn't matter that the menu is short because if you come with an open mind, you will get a great meal whether you are a meat eater or a vegetarian. Everything on the menu is very good gourmet food at a reasonable price.  The Baratin lunch menu is much more simpIe than the FnB dinner menu but it is just as enjoyable. They only cary local Arizona wines and draft beers. They also serve delicious cocktails. I ordered the fresh squeezed lemonade and a turkey sandwich called the Macy's Day Parade Part 2. The lemonade was so good! Probably the best lemonade I have ever had. It had a little bit of pulp in it. It was just the right balance of sweet and sour. The sandwich was smoked turkey, avocado, mustard greens, feta and green Harissa on fresh gourmet artisan bread. I don't know what Harissa is but I love it now! It made this sandwich pop! It seemed to be a savory type of relish or tapanad. The fresh greens and smokey turkey made this a great experience on the toasted artisan bread. The sandwich was clean, fresh, savory, flavorful and filling. The sandwich came with a mix of pickled vegetables that have the perfect tangy accompaniment to the sandwich. The vegetables were green beans, onions, squash, cauliflower, greens, cucumbers, carrots, and celery. Together you have a great symphony of flavors dancing on your tongue.  End the meal with the butterscotch "puddin" and you will be ruined for life on pudding. The pudding is so full of butterscotch flavor and sweet but not overly sweet. It is topped with fresh whipped cream and baking spice or nutmeg which reminds you of pumpkin pie, as does the thick texture, but it is pudding and it will haunt your dreams. This pudding is the stuff dreams are made of. It is the one dish that is always on the menu. The only problem with the butterscotch pudding is that i can't get my tongue in the bowl to lick it clean, but maybe that was intentional since other people in the restaurant probably don't want to see me stoop to such actions.  The restaurant is not pretentious at all. The employees are always very sweet and give great service. If I lived or worked by Baratin I would come here every day and not get sick of it. If you want simple yet reasonably priced (the sandwich was just $12 and the pudding was $5) gourmet food, come to Baratin. You HAVE TO come in the evening to experience the complex gourmet flavors of FnB from the very same chef!!!

When you enter Twirl you might not see an employee there right away because, as I later saw for myself after paying, that the teenage girl that works there is busy in the back room taking duck-face pictures of herself from above her head with her phone (true story), BUT she will probably be there to ring you up right when you need her to like she was for me.  The frozen yogurt at Twirl is as good as that first run on sentence was long. They may not have as many types of frozen yogurt as some of the other guys but what they do have is good stuff. They have a dozen or so types of froyo that you serve up yourself. They have sample size cups so you can find the right one for you before committing to anything you have to pay for. Then you put on your own toppings and they have allot to choose from. It is great that this whole process is self serve so you can make it the way you want. Then they weigh it and charge you. I had a huge helping and it was $6 and some change but I am a big guy. My wife said she and her sister went there many times and the bill for the both of them was less than my total bill, but I digress. The place has lots of seating, great music and a classy, mellow atmosphere geared towards adults who don't take duck-face photos. I would have liked to see a little bit more variety in their frozen yogurt but I still think Twirl is a good business I would revisit and recommend to friends.

On my second visit with my wife, there were two employees there to greet us when we came in.  There were employees there in the restaurant with us the entire time.  The service was great and duck-faces were non-existant!  Go visit this place for great froyo and the best variety of fresh toppings!
