Bomb.com  They must use high grade secret batter. It's just too addicting. After eating there couple of times it's just been absolutely amazing every time. The food is always fresh, cooked right and delicious. Definitely recommend for those who haven't tried it. They even deliver

The best pizza I have ever had in Arizona!  A1 pizza has been my favorite pizza spot in the valley for a few years. Their pizza is tender and made just right. Try out the BBQ sizilian pizza. The sauce is just right on. The wings and salad are just delicious. I'm really glad and impressed by their service and food. I don't think I want to get pizza from anywhere else from now.

Me and my wife went on a Saturday at 3pm for a late lunch. We walked in and got seated. Unfortunately the person who was seating us decided to stop and start talking to a friend. Pretty unprofessional. They sat us inside with a nice view to the lake. Our waiter came and we ordered Thai curry bowl and chicken enchiladas. For appetizer we ordered calamari. We also ordered a side salads instead of a side.   First thing that went wrong was We got our entrees before our salad and appetizer. I mean that defeats the purpose of an entree. Then the kitchen forgot about my salad so another 5min go by and still no salad. Additionally the calamari was too oily and didn't seem fresh. The Thai curry bowl and enchiladas were pretty decent. But me and my wife for the next two days both got food poisoning.   Honestly besides the view, this restaurant doesn't have much to offer. The bathrooms were really outdated. service wasn't great and food got us sick. Maybe we had a bad experience.

When i first walked in I was amazed by the design and structure. From my experiences Almost all middle Eastern food in town are relatively the same. But By far this is the best middle eastern place here in Arizona. Me and my wife ordered the beef and chicken kabob. The chicken was very tender and the spices were pretty good.   The best part of the restaurant is the floor seating that makes you feel right at home. This is an old tradition that is very enjoyable if your up for a change.   I recommend everyone  to visit and try the amazing food and service that shahrazad provides
