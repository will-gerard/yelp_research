Danny's Car Wash has become synonymous for me with the words "HELL NO!"  Danny's was a 5 star Car Wash 15 years ago!  This place use to really have the WOW FACTOR! I liked it so much I had my vehicle dolled up here as if it came out of the factory show room several times a week... Going to Danny's was a Friday ritual before going out on the town! With the friendliest customer service & a Job #1 attitude, I use to think how I can motivate people like this! I even went to different locations, because I thought maybe the people @ the highland location think I'm a repeat customer & are going the extra mile to keep me coming back!  Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Up-sell! No Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Pressure Up-sell!  I understand this is a business & there is a bottom line, but to pressure your customers to purchase more than they intend is not up-selling, it is unscrupulous! They hit you full force the second you pull into the station! Instead of earning repeat business like they use to they are trying to up-sell you get the works, an oil change and windshield damage repair, and everything else they have to sell! When you decline all the extras they disappear as quickly as they showed up & everywhere else you get nothing but bad attitudes!  They try to rush you out of there as quickly as possible, to the point that they always miss something... I've left there several times in a rush to find the front end of my car still covered with bug marks!  In the past several years I've had countless bad experiences.  So bad that I go out of my way not to use a Danny's Family Car Wash!

IF YOU LIKE TO OVERPAY FOR WATERED DOWN COFFEE, SERVICE WITH AN ATTITUDE, & GET STALE PASTRY WITH FLIES FLYING INSIDE THE BAKERY CASE THAN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! BTW: THERE IS A 50 CENT CHARGE TO USE YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD TO PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE HERE (WTF!)   I hate to write a negative review for a place that use to be an old neighborhood favorite.  But if your loyal customers just stop showing up & never criticize your performance you can 't FIX IT!   So here's my father's words of wisdom that you won't get in any business school:  "People go where they are invited, they stay where they feel welcomed!"  Hava java stopped inviting & welcoming customers when it started putting offensive signs on the bathroom door, and then password protecting its free WiFi service with passwords like BUY COFFEE! It seems that Hava Java lost the hunger to be a superior establishment by having better tasting products at a competitive price, and giving their customers a better experience than their competitors!  Hava Java  use to be a great place to hang out or for a cup of coffee in the Arcadia/Camelback area, but it seems in the past couple of years the place has consistently slipped and it is sharing the faith of another once upon a time great coffee hang out at the Biltmore area, The Coffee Plantation!

A Bit Pricey but you'll came out of the factory show room clean...   Friendly customer service with out the Unscrupulous Pressure Up-sell sales job you get at places like Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash down the street!   I actually belove their sign that this is a family business; & they deserve my repeat business...

If you want to drop $250-$300 & absolutely not impress a date this is the place!!!   Stuffy, Pretentious, uncomfortable, & Mediocre Summarizes This Venue!   The Resort entry & valet parking is very impressive! (1st class)  You will walk thru a beautiful Spanish Hacienda Court Yard to enter this old world decadent restaurant! (Still 1st class)   "So what's the problem" you ask?   Well when you enter this restaurant with a reservation, a snooty hostess will guide to their rather cramped bar to wait for 1 - 1  1/2 hrs. to get your table!(OK it's a popular high end place, & you can practice your art of conversation over the loud volume of many other patrons waiting the same lousy treatment from the hostess....) Oh this is when sticker shock is about to hit you $30-$35 for a beer (a Guinness) & a glass of wine!   You finally get seated & the waiting staff is doing one hell of a job trying to sell you an expensive bottle of wine! (This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share!)  So you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate, or get treated as such.   Now the food does taste good, but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker, it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish! But how much am I paying for this dish!  It's only half a cut of the fish!  Despite all the mastication, it is very hard to swallow!  Somehow you finish your dish! (Mom would be so proud of you cause' your plate is as clean as if it came out of the dish washer!)   So you are now ready for the big finally & the waiters "Fave Pick" on desert! Well off course there are two scrumdiddlyumptious recommends that you will have with the two tiniest espresso shots!  So your bill for $240+ makes its way to the table, & boy if you're planning tipping only 15% you will get the "you cheapskate evil eye" walking out of this restaurant!   Oh 'yah' don't forget to tip the valet, $5 tip also will get you a "are you kidin' me look as well!"

LIFE'S BETTER AT THE VILLAGE!   This was their slogan about ten years ago....   Let me qualify why you too might love this place!   It's not just because that they have the best tennis courts, Yoga studio, Palates, Zumba, Racquetball courts, fully padded running track, Spa, & Salon!   It's because they have the best staff!   The best tennis instructors, the best Yoga, Zumba, Fitness, & yes even Tai Chi instructors! Resulting in the valley's best health & fitness club (period!)   The only draw back is that it is pricey if you are going to join a gym just to lift weights, but if you do other things this place is bar none tops!  "You do get what you pay for!"   They even have a lounge where after playing tennis for 2hrs. you can walk in & get a beer & order a decent meal...

If you are looking for the perfect spot for a first date, this is it! Quaint, romantic, and homey are a few words that come to mind. But the best part for me is; you can not have a bad meal here if you tried, that being said Pollo Cubano is my favorite dish!

If you like P.F. Changs, you will love Pei Wei! It's essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting, & Take-Out! I can't tell a difference between their Orange Chicken, or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag!!! My favorite dish here is the Dan-Dan Noodles! (It's Hot. Spicy, & Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under $10!!!)  If you have not heard; "Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food!" Well neither is Panda Express, but I'll tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express & most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US!  Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants! (NO MSG!)  "Can you believe the balls on this guy!?"  We'll I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco, LA, NY, Vancouver & Dallas! I've even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong; don't be impressed it was not that good! I love Chinese food, but I really love Asian Fusion! Roy's, PF Changs, & Pei Wei really wet my noodle!  The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out!  I have them on speed dial... So when I'm on my way home from work I'll call, & as I pull in I pay, pick up, and go! It's freshly cooked & No Wait!!!

This is not the original Cine Capri... And I absolutely loved watching movies @ the original Cine Capri!   Cine Capri was a theatre destination for me when I went to ASU 20+ years ago! Between the 70mm projector, with 30' by 70' widescreen, & a multi-channel sound system with a curtain opening that made you sink into your velvet plush rocker-style Theatre seats! Because as the big wide screens curtain opened you got sucked into world created by creative imaginations of Coppola, Scorsese, Spielberg, & Cameron. . I'm not being nostalgic, I'm just stating a fact that I don't feel the goose bumps that I use to feel as the original with the gold waterfall curtains slid open and the Cine Capri logo is projected on the curtains.  The last thing the original Cine Capri showed was Titanic, I think maybe with the splendor of the Cine Capri & Titanic there was some parallels that could be drawn between the two & it was a befitting Last Curtain Call...  The new Cine Capri has some of the same features as the original Cine Capri, and pays homage to the original... this one has similar to the original multi-channel sound system.  But as the new 3-D & digital presentations are trying to give you the same sensation if not more, the new auditorium is not quite as grand as the original. It might be the same big size room, but the layout is elongated and not as wide as the original. Make sure you don't get caught in the first 4 rows because you cannot see the whole screen!  However, I cannot say anything really bad about this theatre and the multiplex that is attached to it. Its 1st class as far as customer service, cleanliness & snack bars go.  It is also the best theatre to see larger than life "event" features such as Avatar, Spiderman, and Iron Man. Ok a little nostalgia, I do wish I could go back & catch Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, & The Original Star Wars on the Original Cine Capri 70mm projector!  You will definitely see me in this place again and again!

If over priced small portion dishes are your thing, then this is the place for you!!!  My review of this place 3-4 years ago, would have been 5 stars!  But  the portions (the burger) has shrunk 25%, and price has gone up 25%!   The food quality has consistently been good!    But the way they've gone to increase their margins annoyed me & my friends to not go back!   The place is always busy so I don't think ownership really cares they've lost me & several of my friends business!

Camelback Mountain ONE MOUNTAIN W/ 2 FANTASTIC TRAILS... Echo Canyon & Cholla trail - 64th St (Invergordon). Both offer amazing splendid scenery & a fantastic workout.   This is one of my favorite thing about living in Phoenix!  Caution! I've seen many people get helicoptered off this mountain!  #1 reason heart attacks! This mountain is not the treadmill/stair master/eliptical training machine!  #2 reason broken bones  Slippery trails w/ loose gravel, rocks, cliffs. & e rough sharp edges. The most dangarous thing about this mountain though is the idiots who pay attention to no one... A combination of obnoxious loud talkers, cell phone users and pushy runners! Just use caution and you'll be fine.  I personally like to hike it mid-week & not on holidays inorder to find a little solitude...

"OK-OK-OK!"  If you are on a diet most definitely this is not the place for you!  If over paying for a Philly Cheese steak, they call it "a large," I was wanting more when I finished my Sandwich, again not the place for you!!!   However if you want to walk into an authentic Mafioso looking deli-restaurant with a sandwich, an epicurean delight, that will give you multiple foodgasms than "Yo, how you doin'!"   All I'll say is that the smooth taste and texture of the Philly Cheese steak sandwich was incredibly flavorful, and beyond delicious! Enough to have your eyes roll back in your head and possibly shout "this is so f¢ing good!!"   When you walk in this joint there is a large profile picture of Don Corleone, Marlon Brando, with the words;  "Make 'Em A Sandwich They Can't Refuse!"  Now that's a Slogan!   They even have a real Pickle Bar with banana peppers, hot peppers, and homemade salt pickles. I loved it!!!   "Bing, Bang, Boom!" I scarfed mine down and I wanted more.

I hope you enjoy this restaurant as much as I did!  I've had Mexican Food in the best restaurants in Mexico City, & hands down Padre's lives up to it's reputation of being one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The food is spicy but not so hot that you have to drink gallons of libations just to put the fire out... Although every one boasts about their Margaritas, I tried out the Sangria, it was so good that I had ordered a second...  I will definitely go back!

The Vig is Arcadia's Neighborhood Bar!  Swanky Vibe W/ Fantastic Music Consistantly Good Food Great Friendly Service  & A Price Tag That Won't Bankrupt you!  "Oh Yeah" - Awsome Monday Night Burger Special Their Burger is as good if not better than some of these over priced Burger Joints! The only draw back  it does get very crowded...  Still The Vig is one of my favorite places to go for a fun night out...  They did an excellent job remodeling this cinder block run down building to its 1960's splender... The mature landscaping with trees that hang down over the outside tables and the dim lighting candlelight ambiance set the mood.    Weather your out with a few friends or on a hot date this Resturant/ Bar will not disappoint you!

"This restaurant is always busy!" (Lunch, Dinner, Winter, Summer) The quality of food in this restaurant is Primo!  I feel by stating the fact above I've given you an idea how good the food is...    I've tried the appetizers, the salads, the Falafels, the Gyros, & the "hummus!"  "Oh the Hummus!"  My favorite is the "Hummus with the seared Ahi!"  I've never had a bad meal here! The service has always been great. They get your food to you fast...Also the waiting staff is very bohemian, which makes dinning here even more interesting! This is not a stuffy upscale restaurant, but the food is as good if not better than most of the overpriced joints around town!  My only complaint is that it is always busy, & therefore loud!

The signature Torta Norteña is the bomb! A cross between a Hamburger & Roast Beef Sandwich, this tasty Mexican style sandwich has grilled steak, grilled onions, jalapenos, cheese, avocado and a mayo chipotle sauce.   If you like Mexican food you'll love Los Reyes de la Torta, as long as you are totally (Seriously) down with hole in the wall places in the hood?

GHETTO  MART best describes this hell hole!  When I drove into this places driveway the first thing going thru my mind was; "am I going to get mugged or hold-up just getting out of my car!" With trash all over the parking lot I seriously wonder if they ever clean their parking lot!   Then somehow due to the promise of cheaper prices I made it in the store. Even with all the security cameras I was still worried if I was going to get robbed in this joint.(All I'll say is there was a lot of conspicuous /shady characters shopping in this place.)  I asked a question where the light bulbs were, and the person working the floor was very short with me! I think she was worried she was going to get mugged in this place too! I found my light bulbs & went to one of the mega lines. With twenty check stands they only had two open & 15 customers standing in lines! (You got to be freaking be Kidding me!) At this point I decided to leave GHETTO  MART/WALMART, & drive 1/2 mile east to 44th street & Thomas & go to Target instead. (Much Cleaner, just as inexpensive!)  I can't believe WALMART is the #1 private employer in the State of Arizona??? WALMART truly is the DEATH STAR to our economy!

If mastication is your thing than this place is "Absolute Foodgasm!"  The last time I had BBQ Rib-Tips this good, I was in Charleston, SC, in a place called Sticky Fingers, and the year was 1995! I've been looking for a place in Phoenix for the past 16 years & I'm happy to say I finally have found it!   You do not pay for the ambiance of a five star restaurant in this joint. This place is an absolute whole in the wall, down & dirty, & smells like a smokehouse shack! So if you want to impress someone on a first date, it's probably not the place to dine (there is Take-Out!) Definitely not a place to take clients you want to impress either! (Did I mention Take-Out?)   But if you want to have BBQ that is finger licking good, than Stacy's Smokehouse is your kinda joint!

When my sister told me about her favorite hang out/Sushi Bar in AZ, I was very skeptical!  Having had Sushi in LA, SF, Maine and several cities in Japan, I usually won't give a Sushi restaurant in AZ 5 stars!!!  The fish has to be very fresh, the sushi chef Japanese, the ambiance authentic, and the service superb for me to even consider 4 stars.  After several visits to this restaurant I can truly give them a Positive & Objective review.  Although I like traditional Sashimi dishes like Torro, I'm opening my pallet to the creative rolls like Dragon, Lolly Pop &  Las Vegas Rolls!  If you are a big Sushi fan like me you will definitely love this place...

In a world of big box stores, its great to see a "Ma & Pa" Tennis shop dominate in Arizona!   I have watched this little Tennis shop double and triple in inventory and size in the past twenty plus years. Maybe it's because they will get your racquet restrung when your in a hurry while you shop the store, or the best selection of Tennis Shoes, and cloths in Arizona, or even the best selection of the latest racquets!  Actually, I think its their top notch demo program! Pay $30 for the best selection of demos to try with many grip sizes and the strings and when you have chose the right racquet they will even apply the $30 toward the purchase of your new racquet!    All About Tennis is not the cheapest place, but bar-none has the best selection of Tennis gear in all of Arizona!  Don't take my word for it go check them out!

A cup of Ice for $3!  Are you Kiddin' me?   Three tacos for $5 is a good deal! A can of Soda for $1 not a bad deal... But when you order the lemonade for $3, it's 95% crushed ice & comes with a cute little umbrella in the straw, well this part is a "rip off!" "Seriously! "  I usually order differnt Tacos & they are good! All the ingredients are fresh...The  fish, carne asada and chicken are my favorites.   The green and red salsas are tasty. Also freshly made  If I didn't feel so ripped off on the lemonade, & I've made this mistake several times, I would give this place Five Stars!

"You get what you pay for!" ***NOT HERE!***  I joined LA fitness in Scottsdale about five years ago, cause they had a brand new club with in walking distance from me @ McCormick Ranch, & off course with any new club comes  new aerobics, workout & spinning studios with all new equipment. So I paid initiation fee & joined. I was so excited I even got a couple of my buddies to join.  Well I moved back to phoenix the following year & basically this LA fitness became my gym by default! WOW!  This place made my old high school gym seem sanitary in comparison! My old high school gym stunk! This place was about 3 steps down from that!  I did like the Zumba Instructors & the the aerobics program so I stayed for several more years, always making sure not to touch anything walking in or out! Well they managed to screw that up as well changing the Zumba program to LA Fitness Latin Heat & firing all of the Zumba instructors. One particular instructor right as he was walking in to teach his class! WOW!  So that was the last straw for me...

If Architecture & Ambiance is your thing than this is the place for you!  Frank Lloyd Wright, and his draftsman, Albert Chase Mcarthur, are honored by naming their Phoenix architectural masterpiece at the Biltmore Resort's main restaurant after them...   The menu is good, the atmosphere a little dated, and there are a lot of blue hairs dining in this restaurant!   It was not cheap & there was not much there on the plate to fill me up! Overpriced & stingy portions are my big pet peeve... Great if your on a date & want to order desert & coffee to hang out though!  I like the old school ambiance of this place, what I didn't like was the waitress telling me the lunch salad was a good portion, I'm sitting here starving as I write this review! It was Tasty though, but unless you are a 5'7" 105 lbs super model this dish will not satisfy your hunger!   The reason I give it 2 stars is because I liked the food, & the atmosphere!

Hands down one of the worst cocktails I ever had anywhere!!!  Went to this places on a Saturday evening with a few friends after dinner! Asked waiter for some cocktail recommendations... 4 of us got the espresso Martinis! they had the cheapest lousiest Vodka (tasted like turpentine)!  Another buddy ordered a White Russian & he was complaining of the same thing. When we brought this up to waiter he did absolutely nothing! The six of us closed our tab & left after this experience & will never go back!

You think for an $11 drink they wouldn't use the really cheap/crapy Vodka! they had the cheapest lousiest Vodka (tasted like turpentine)!  Another buddy ordered a White Russian & he was complaining of the same thing.   When we brought this up to waiter he did absolutely nothing!

Fantastic Food - Lousy Decor!   For a restaurant who's reputation is based on having the tastiest burgers in town having my friends & I sit in a booth with a Poster Sized Picture of Joe Appaio (aka The Nazi Sheriff of Arizona) in the booth enjoying one of these tasty burgers was rather tasteless!   Two of my friends refused to order anything, which made me realize how much hatred the Hispanic community has for The Sheriff!   I have no political affiliation so I give you my honest opinion, the food is scrumptious! The architecture & ambiance was also very nice.   Now if only someone can talk to the owner of this joint to keep pictures of public figures such as Joe out of booths people dine in I believe he would get a lot less hate!!!   Sport figures such as Ali, Robinson, DiMaggio, Namath, McEnroe might be a safer bet! (OK Johny Mac might not be such a safe choice!)   BTW I will go back & definitely ask not to be seated w/ Joe again! LOL

If going to a super sized store & spending 2-3 hours on Saturday morning doing your grocery shopping is your thing than this probably is not the place for you.   But, if you have a busy life style, you want to run in & out and get something healthy to eat, then  Fresh & Easy is the place for you.  A very friendly staff, affordable, a great sampling area in the back, and exceptional quality (produce, as well as pre-made meals.)   They also have the best Lemonade in their refrigerated section.

FAST FOOD & PERSIAN FOOD ARE USUALLY NOT SYNONOMYS!  As A Persian Food Aficionado, I have had Kabob all over the world...  I love Persian Food! "No!" I love good Persian food!  Well the first few times I was walking into The Subway restaurant next door to this place I peeked, but was very hesitant to walk in! Well thanks to my buddy I finally tried it. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! The Kabobs: Kubiedeh, Barg (the cuts of fillet), and Chicken Kabob are all tasty, and the daily dishes are all very authentic & tasty.  The ambiance is standard fast food restaurant, the staff is very friendly & greets you when you walk in, and answer any questions you may have. So if you want to skip McDonalds and Subway and go Mediterranean,  Zaytoon Kabob is a great choice for the real Middle Eastern dining experience!

Bosa Donuts puts the  "D'oh!" in DONUTS! "AHHH. Donuts. . . What can't they do!" Homer Simpson  Now that we got the Homer Simpson quotes out of the way, seriously; this place can turn you into HOMER SIMPSON!  When my buddy was telling me how he was addicted to this donut & I had to just try them! My reaction was "OK Homer they are just donuts!" & "You can't do much better than Krispy Kreme in Phoenix!"   Plus;  "Donuts? I told you I don't like ethnic food!" (Montgomery Burns)  He literally made me get in the car and drove to this place!  The look of disappointment just covered his face when the gal announced; They were out of the one particular one he had his mind set on! So a week later he made it a point that we go back to this place... Again middle of the afternoon and they were out of the "Chocolate Wheeler!" So the following week mid morning we went by this place. Again they were out!  By this point I'm thinking maybe the fact these suckers are like 85cents maybe they are good and they make a dozen or two & sell out!  The next day, after finishing a 3 set Tennis Match, in the parking lot in front of the Tennis courts I ask him so where are you going for breakfast!  He just smiles reaches into the back of his SUV and pulls out a pink cake box, and opens the box!   There are a dozen of these bad boys in the box!  "Aye Carumba!" (Bart Simpson)  So with a "REALLY! you bought a whole "F"ing dozen look on my face" I reach in and pull one of these Famous Wheelers out! I examine it visually; it looks no more special than any other donut!   So as I sink my teeth into it I have to say;  "OMG!" & I mean "OH MY GOD!"  I think I just had a FOODGASM! (yes it's a real word, you can Google it!)  And I'm sporting wood just thinking about that moment!!!  I KNOW, I know, you must be thinking this guy must think he is writing "DEAR PENTHOUSE...!" But you know how when you fall in love with that one girl that pales all other relationships before & after her?  Well to quote another fictional character this donut is "Simply Scrumdiddlyumptious!"   To find out what this means I guess you have to get to Bosa Donuts before me & all the other "Homers" & spend 85cents!)  In comparison Krispy Kreme pales to Bosa Donuts!   WARNING: You can't have just one!

Superstar really has the WOW FACTOR!  Today was the first time I have used Superstar Car Wash and I was very, very pleased, so I'm giving them 5 stars...   My car looked great once they were finish.     With a friendly & highly motivated staff I drove off feeling like a Rock Star, I mean a "Superstar!"  "I'll be back!"

NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA (aka NoRTH Arcadia) misses the mark!!! All I got here was slight heartburn & Dirty Shoes & Pants!  How can a Sam Fox concept restaurant,  headed up by the former NOCA chef, Chris Curtiss miss the mark? If your a total Foodie like me, & you like Sauce - Pizza & Wine, olive & ivy, & Bloom you might be in for some disappointment!  When this restaurant was going up I had high hopes for it to be a neighborhood hang out. After all we have a few good restaurants in our neighborhood so one more adds to the selection of my favorite Arcadia hang-outs, and a Sam Fox Concept Restaurant in between Chelsea's Kitchen, The Grind, & LGO should only help minimize the wait time to get a table in any of these awesome eateries!(Woo-Hoo!!!)  Now who puts up a freestanding down to earth restaurant (as it's marketed) next door to U-haul, and only offers valet parking? (WTF!)  Oh yeah, the dirt floor outside patio as organic as it may look will cover your Italian loafers and nicely pressed Slacks in dirt! Seriously, not a good idea for couples on dates in their Sunday best, and expensive shoes. You can pretty much assume if you have a nice automobile that you will valet park, you are going to be dressed to impress, and when you leave dinner to go clubbing or  to your favorite watering whole you will look like a F--king  hobo!   Here is a suggestion, shoot your Architect & get either the guy who did The Parlor on Camelback or the Grind, and  fix not only the Patio, but also the dinning room! Your dinning room is not just Loud, but also very badly designed! (Seriously!)  The Arcadia NoRTH menu is based upon interpretation of traditional Italian cuisine, and is OK, but nothing here is making me say "I'm craving NoRTH!"  To be really frank, I like the Pizza and deserts @ LGO/PIZZARIA much better!!!  Sorry Sam but like Radio Milano the snob factor is much higher here than the dinning elegance that your menu pricing warrants!  NoRTH Arcadia (aka NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA) is another upscale traditional Italian cuisine restaurant with the promise of authentic dishes without the "snob factor!"   The 4th time in the last ten years this restaurant concept has been tried in our neighborhood!!! Like the last 3 times I have to say this I don't see that special little something, "je ne sais quoi."

Chick Rotisserie & Wine Bar has the best food in the "hood," that's the Arcadia neighborhood!!!   The ambiance is not pretentious but very nice, perfect for a very memorable first date! The wine selection is great, but not so expensive to have to take out a second on your home to pay the tab...  As a self proclaimed Food Aficionado, I have traveled four continents and dined around the world... The chicken, filet, Salmon all melt in your mouth like "Butta;" as a matter of fact the Chicken is so flavorful you will salivate long after you masticated a mouthful! The Filet is equally tasty,  not only marinated  to perfection but the best cuts of fillet I have ever had in Phoenix! As far as sides go I have to say their mashed potato is pronominal!   I have to admit we have a lot of great eateries in north east phoenix, & Chick Rotisserie & Wine Bar is a place that I will frequent often!

You have to experience this place to find out for yourself what all the "RU-HA" is all about! The place has great food, great live entertainment, and great selection of Micro-Brews on tap!

Going to Little Woody is like having an exciting secret affair? You don't want everyone to know about it, but it's so much fun you don't want to deny yourself of the pleasure!  The little woody its a hole in the wall, little neighborhood bar that everyone in the hood knows about despite the fact there is no signage outside the lit up cartoon eyes in the front window and no main street parking!

SKYPARK IS THE PLACE TO TAKE YOUR KIDS IN THE ARCADIA AREA!  My daughter loves going to this place with her friends, & I love taking her there! She gets to hang out with her friends in a safe environment & also do an activity that is a lot of fun & a great work out! There is a great concession stand with real pizza from Mamamias (YUM!) There are comfortable couches & WiFi for the parents to chill while their kids jump. They have several trampoline rinks to jump & also basketball trampoline stations. They also have a foam pit!  This place is the equivalent to the roller rinks our parents use to take us to 20+ years ago...  I can not say enough nice things about the SKYPARK, & your kids will agree with me too!

Del Frisco's Grille is the latest upscale restaurant  in the Camelback Corridor in Phoenix, & its a  hit! Located just steps away from the MercBar, the AMC movie theater, and the Arizona Biltmore and the Ritz Carlton tower this is a great place to start a fun evening.  Combining a comfortable yet hip atmosphere with a exciting savory menu, and crafted cocktails, it's a great place to take a romantic date, or to catch up with friends. The bar, upstairs, has breathtaking views of Squaw Peak and the Arizona sunset.
