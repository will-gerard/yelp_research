This was my first and last experience at Wild Thaiger and I will not be going back. Ever. The service was unacceptable. From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant the experience was bad. In hindsight, I should have walked out after our issues with the hostess. She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall. At first, I felt like those people were incredibly rude, but now I wish that I had left too rather than enduring a total lack of service.  It took a long time for us to get water or our drinks. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left.  The restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness. I found the menu to be limiting, and the items lacked enough description. I will never go back. I have no idea how it had such good reviews.

Y-U-M! I can't wait to go back to this little gem. Try the "Tyler" it was delicious. They have so many menu options, I'm going to have to make several trips back to try everything. The shop itself is very small, quaint, clean and family owned. The owner was kind and helpful, I can't wait to go back.

Scott's Generations? Never again. I've been wanting to try Scott's for years. I love deli, and I was very disappointed by the food, service and overall experience I had at Scott's today.   During the end of the lunch rush Scott's was empty. That should have been a sign. The restaurant was filthy. The temperature was hot and sticky despite having the the door open (it was about 72 in phoenix today.)  The booths had exposed cushioning, tables hadn't been cleared or cleaned and the floor looked like something that belonged in an episode of kitchen nightmares. Ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part.   My friend and I finally found a clean-ish booth and sat down. Our table was dirty, and when the waitress came by I had to ask her to wipe it off even though there were visible crumbs and our menus were sticky. She acted like it had never occurred to her to clean a table off before. She actually tilted her head when I asked her to do so, as if she had been confused by the request. We should have just left.   We ordered our food. I got a pathetic bowl of matzo ball soup, my friend a sad looking chicken noodle. I had one very tiny measly looking matzo ball, and the veggies had been cooked to death. There were chicken bones in my soup. The flavor tasted like it had been seasoned with a generic version of Stouffer's dressing mix.   I ordered a lean pastrami and asked for it to go. It came to our table without fries  accompanied by the saddest, wilted coleslaw. It was not prepared to go. The pastrami was fatty (despite the menu bragging about how they don't charge extra for lean) The pickles were great, and house made. The pickles were the only bright spot of the meal.   My friend asked if they had soda by the bottle, the waitress forgot that they carried Dr Brown's (a deli staple) and I had to jog her memory. She forgot the request twice and after being reminded twice she finally brought the soda.  By this point I was so over it I just wanted to leave. I asked for a box, she over charged us, I didn't give a flying fig about that and over paid just to be able to leave.   Six hours later my stomach is upset. I won't be returning. I may be calling the health inspector. Like many generational things, I hope Scott's gets left in the past.

Pizza Heaven is like the goldilocks of the Pizza food world. When you're looking for something juuuust right. The food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable.

The Nagasaki Grill itself is wonderful! This is probably some of the most authentic Japanese food you could ever hope to eat. The owners are very sweet and friendly. It should be noted that the restaurant is located in a rather dicey part of Mesa. There was a crackhead  wandering aimlessly around the parking lot while we ate our dinner. My friend and I found it to be slightly off putting and amusing, kind of like the most bizarre dinner and a show we've ever experienced. The owners apologized, which was a nice gesture, but the situation was clearly beyond their control. Nagasaki restaurant is sandwiched in between a McDonald's and a smoke shop. Try to consider the passing addicts to be part of  the restaurant's the eclectic ambience. Also, for those of you that appreciate retro-kitsch, this place looks like a portal to 1983. I found it to be charming. Try the sashimi dinner special, for $18 you'll get a gorgeous spread that's enough for two people, we also ordered chicken udon and it was absolutely delicious. This place is legit!

I've been the happy owner of a MacBook Pro now for almost three years. My overall relationship with apple since the introduction of the intel chip has been disappointing. I had issues with the original MacBook, and when I purchased my MacBook Pro in May 2008, it had problems right out of the box. The apple store at Chandler took care of me then, replacing my brand new computer with almost no questions asked. Two and a half years go by, and I had no problems whatsoever with my computer. Unfortunately, I took my computer in for an issue in February 2011, and I found out that they forgot to transfer my apple care warranty over to my replaced machine. Que womp womp womp sound. Justin took great care of me, he comped my order, and he gave me three months to send in the repair. The time allotment was really helpful as I'm a full time student, and being away from my computer wasn't really an option. I had the computer serviced this week (second week of May) while I was out of town, after finals. When I dropped off my computer Jorge helped me he was also great, witty, personable, really thorough, he even assisted me in checking my backup and fixed what I didn't do correctly. Cut to one week later, I'm home from vacation, I have a MacBook pro in perfect condition. Life is good. Once again, Justin helped me. He was very thorough (but really expedient) personable and just absolutely great. The team at  Apple Chandler doesn't just provide service with a smile, they provide service that makes you smile. I couldn't be happier with my experience.

Hello, my name is Josie and I'm a deli-holic.  I. Love. Goldman's. This review is an update, it's been about two years since I first discovered Goldman's Deli. I was hesitant to jump on the Goldman's bandwagon at first, thankfully, things have changed. I eat at Goldman's about once a week.   There are three major things that make Goldman's wonderful:  1. They are family owned and operated, Mrs. Goldman is so sweet, she recognizes her regular patrons and knows them by name. The staff is always helpful and friendly.  2. The food is fantastic and fresh 3. It is always impeccably clean   Their soup is amazing, it's always so difficult to choose just one (I strongly suggest the matzo ball, or sweet and sour cabbage!) I know that people love their Borscht. Their sandwiches are to die for, I'm obsessed with their turkey pastrami, boyfriend loves their Ruben's. Their baked goods are delicious, take home a multi-pack of their Rugulach. I usually get the same thing when I go to Goldman's, half a  turkey pastrami sandwich on rye, with a cup of soup (even though I always want to get a bowl.) I always leave happy and full and so will you.   The only reason I won't give Goldman's five stars is because their prices are quite high (not unusual for a deli restaurant) and the portions are not as large as most deli's, therefore, I don't think that the prices are reasonable. Also, they will nickel and dime you over small things (like charging for pickles) or charging for butter.  Also, they don't make their own pickles...even Chompie's (gross) makes their own pickles! But, I can forgive Goldman's for their high prices and pathetic pickles. I suggest this place to everyone that will listen. I feel like a deli pusher.  Delicious!

Maxim is delicious! The neighborhood and building appear to be a little dicey, but don't let the dirt parking lot fool you, there is a delicious gem waiting inside. This is some of the best Pho I've ever had the pleasure of eating, the flavor depth of their broth is practically unparalleled. The spring rolls were brimming with shrimp, and they were a refreshing treat when it was 100 outside. The owners were friendly and attentive. Their prices were beyond fair, I don't know how they've managed to stay open for ten years and keep their quality and prices so reasonable. I can't wait to go back. If you prefer quality and authenticity opposed to presentation and decor, you will absolutely adore Maxim.

We went here because Maxim and Pho Thanh were both closed. All of the good Pho in Phoenix seems to be nestled around 19th Ave between Osborn and Camelback which is not my favorite part of town. Don't let the sketchy area put you off, it's worth venturing into the hood. The prices are  incredible. We got two orders of spring rolls, two bowls of pho, and two desserts (SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT OH. MY. GAH.) our bill came out to $23.  The service was "meh" at best, but this is not the kind of restaurant you go to for ambiance, or service, you patronage this establishment because you want authentic cuisine. I could eat here on a daily basis, and it's so cheap that I could afford to.

I've had my nails done here twice. Once was great, the second and most recent time was awful. The manicurist was extremely pushy, I tried politely declining his up-sale suggestions, but he continued to push until I was practically forced to be rude. I have really painful and possibly infected cuticles due to the negligence of their manicurist. My gels began chipping after about four days. I'm thrilled that I paid in cash and tipped over 40% for this crappy job. Don't go there, their work is inconsistent at best.

Warning: this review is going to be positively glowing. If you're not in it for the long-haul, I understand. Try this place. Try the lemonade, try the turkish coffee, try the tabbouleh, try the falafel. If you don't mind a longer review read on:   The owner, Isam,  couldn't have been more friendly, informative, generous or helpful. When he found out it was my first time at the restaurant he insisted that I try the lemonade, baklava and turkish coffee (I completely agreed) and then  *bam* he insisted that they were on the house. I was not expecting such a generous offer and I was more than happy to pay for these items myself, Isam's pride of ownership is genuinely impressive. He seems to run his business from an old-school model based on integrity, a little showmanship, and a product that truly sells itself.    I proceeded to order, Lebanese chicken and grape leaves and wait for my food. They brought my lemonade, and to be honest, I really had no idea what could have possibly been so wonderful about lemonade that I would just HAVE to try it. Well, I have three simple answers rose water, orange blossom, and honey. They don't put any sugar in their lemonade, it has this beautiful delicate floral taste, anchored by a richness from the honey. You will love it.   The lebanese chicken and grape leaves were ahhmazing. The tabbouleh is incredible and balanced to perfection. Not too much of this, or that...just right. The owner tells me that they go through about five batches per day. I believed him.   Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli was so delicious, I began snapping pictures of my food and plotting my yelp review while still in the restaurant. I began bragging via text to all of my foodie friends. I took a to-go order for friends I was meeting up with later, it seemed like a nice gesture, but really I just wanted to have an excuse to try more of their delicious fare.   Per Isam's insistence, he brought a piece of baklava and turkish coffee. The baklava was delicious. The shining star was the turkish coffee. My god. Best. Coffee. Ever. Seriously. If nothing else, go here and order lemonade and turkish coffee. You will be thrilled.   If I don't eat at this place at least once a week as long as I live in Phoenix I'm going to be disappointed. I can't wait to go back. Upon leaving the restaurant I noticed a new gyro place had opened two doors down. I actually felt sorry for them, their business is probably going to tank by proxy.

Tonight, my boyfriend and I tried Thai Elephant for dinner. I absolutely love Thai food, and I'm always on the hunt for the perfect Thai restaurant. Thai Elephant had lots of parking, it was clean, and the staff was friendly. Where things took a turn for the worse lies within the cuisine itself.  To begin, we ordered two Thai tea's and an order of fresh rolls (I L-O-V-E fresh rolls.) The tea came out first, and it was really, really sweet. Too sweet. The tea seemed to have been steeped for too long, and it had too much sugar. The end result was a very tannony, very sweet, unharmonic union. Strike one. Then the fresh rolls came out, their dipping sauce was great, but the rolls themselves were served warm (weird) and cut into quarters which means that we only got two rolls total. I thought this was a little stingy. They used a pan-fried tofu in the rolls, and from a texture standpoint fried tofu and rice paper just seemed odd together. Strike two. We ordered dinner, I asked our waitress to keep in mind how much I love eggplant and what dish I should get. She suggested the green curry. I'm not a fan of cream based anything, but she said it was one of the house specialties, and I took her advise. I shouldn't have done that. Boyfriend got the Pad Thai with shrimp. Our dishes came out from the kitchen really quickly (that was appreciated) Even looking at our respective plates was upsetting. My dish looked like someone had thrown up green gravy, whereas boyfriends was brimming with beautiful peppers, and succulent shrimp. Looks can be deceiving, and we dug in. I didn't like the texture of the curry, it was heavy, it was too sweet, it was too mild, there was too much of it. Getting through it was difficult, and at times, stomach turning. Thankfully, boyfriend loved mine and helped finish it. By the end of our meal, my plate was smeared with green curry (my feeble attempt to rid vegetables of that awful sauce) His Pad Thai was also too sweet (shocker) and the noodles were overcooked (which is pretty typical) but the spice and flavor was otherwise well balanced and good. Strike three.  Boyfriend wants to go back, he thinks it's some of the best Thai food that he's ever had.  If you're the type of person who enjoys eating food while you're in Disneyland, then you'll probably love this place. It's mediocre at best, the service is upbeat and friendly, and everything tastes unnecessarily sweet.  I'll probably try Thai Elephant again, and update my experience. However, I may never eat green curry again as long as I live.

I called this office to get a price comparison, and the receptionist/technician was beyond unhelpful, frankly she was confusing. This office is in need of a phone etiquette lesson.

I ordered delivery. I got the eggplant tofu dish and spring rolls with shrimp. Delivery took longer than expected, the spring rolls didn't have shrimp. The eggplant was so over cooked it was just eggplant mush and the sauce was way too soy sauce heavy. It's great that they deliver, it's too bad they can't read their tickets correctly or have decent dishes.

I have taken two suits into Seams To Be Alterations. After dropping my first suit off and having a negative experience, I should have walked away rather than letting them tailor another, but it was convenient and I didn't follow my instincts.   The first time I used S.T.B.A. there were some warning signs, the owner was terribly disorganized (she lost my suit, it took her almost twenty minutes to find it) they make you pay for the alterations before you receive your altered garment (not totally unusual, but not completely professional either) she also told me that my suit would take a week to be altered, but in actuality it took two.   When I went to pick up my suit they were "busy" meaning myself and another customer were in the store, the staff (owner and another woman) didn't seem to know how to deal with the extra business. I brought in a full suit, and one extra suit jacket. The owner told me that she didn't want to tailor the extra jacket because it was too minimal of a repair. I disagreed. What type of business owner refuses extra money? While I understand that darting my jacket would have been tedious for her, it would have also put an extra $40 in her pocket. I digress.  I overheard a staff member lecturing the other patron about how he shouldn't have bought the garment he purchased, and that it was going to be hard for her to "fix them." I don't know about you, but I don't take garments in to have them judged, I take them in to be altered. I certainly don't need a lecture from a seamstress, I was appalled that someone would speak to a customer that way.   I gave her two weeks, and  went in today to pick up my second suit. Instead of being on the nice wooden hanger that it was brought in on, my suit was on a used wire hanger. The suit was dirty, I immediately had to take it to the dry cleaner. She also made the sleeves too short, and uneven. Then she made it seem as if it were my fault that the sleeves were too short and uneven. The lining was stitched incorrectly and now in addition to being uneven, and too short, the sleeves also appear to be lumpy. Wonderful.   If you are in the market to have your nice and rather expensive things ruined, then by all means, go to Seams To Be Alterations. If you would prefer your garments to remain intact or be tailored properly, I would suggest going somewhere else. I have no idea how this company can stay in business.

I've gone to Top Design Nails about eight times in the last three months. I recently moved to the area, and it had decent yelp reviews so I thought I would check it out. I'm going to keep this as brief as possible. This place is inconsistent, I'm putting that as nicely as I possibly can. Sometimes, you get incredible service, sometimes you get rude, unreasonable service. Most of the time you get rude unreasonable service. It's a dice game. To their merit, they are relatively clean, tools are sterilized and packaged, stations are cleaned after each service. That being said, this place is ghetto. Startlingly so. The floor is uneven, they use the tailoring room as a lunch room, the chairs and stations have all seen much better days, it's decorated poorly and lit even worse. I would rather drink tap water from Tijuana than get waxed here.   I love that on Mondays and Tuesdays pedicures are $15. I hate that they charge you to use the debit/credit machine. In my opinion, that is one of the costs incurred from owning a business and the customer should not have to see/pay for it. That cost should be padded into the actual cost of the services. Also, they nickel and dime over inane things, nails filed in a round shape are $2 more than nails done in square (a rule that only applies sometimes at Top Design Nails)   I hate that they have nail techs that speak so little english, I had to google search the word "pointy" in vietnamese and then show her what a cat claw looked like from an image search. This was not her fault, but I think it's fair to instill a basic language vocabulary within an employee before they hit the salon floor.  I hate the fact that at the end of the pedicure they don't replace the soaking wet towel with a dry one.   I've had manicures and gel nails here, I wouldn't go back for either. My gels lasted one week before they began peeling, and my manicure was such a nightmare, I don't even want to go into the details. This place is strictly for pedicures only, or if I needed something tailored, like a pair of jeans (convenient but very, very, strange that they do nails and alterations) I would never trust them with anything of any importance or significance.   If you're in the neighborhood, you need a pedicure and you appreciate a good bargain, check it out. Bring your patience, and your cash.

I hate to write a review this good, for fear of having my new find infiltrated by yelpers. Bella nails is fantastic. Everything was impeccably clean, and the employees were professional and respectful. I love that each pedicure includes a hot stone massage, and a steamed towel. That's a really nice touch that you'd expect from a higher-end salon, not a place that charges $18 for a pedicure. I also love that everyone preforming pedicures wears gloves. They didn't use pressure tactics to up-sell me services, I wasn't badgered into getting a flower etc, which was refreshing. Their pedicure pricing is really reasonable,  but my gel-manicure was kind of pricey, around $40 (even though their menu says $32) but, I was treating myself. My nails look GORGEOUS. The woman who helped me did such a good job. Another thing that I appreciated about her was that she listened, did exactly as asked, and didn't feel the need tor unnecessary chit chat. They really picked up as the night went on. At one point there were 4 people waiting.  While I didn't like that they charged me about $8 extra for my manicure, and couldn't explain why,  I'll definitely go back. I probably won't splurge on a french gel-manicure every two weeks, but I'll be going in for pedicures and regular manicures like clockwork. I've found my new place!  The only downside are the lack of parking (about six spots), unexplainable up charges, and I could have stood for a longer massage, but I'm really nitpicking. This place gets a solid four stars, they deserve every single one.

There are a lot of choices at Mucha Lucha, you order your food a lot like at chipotle by going down the line and communicating with a cook. If you don't speak Spanish there may be a language barrier. I asked the cook for some suggestions, and not only could she not answer me, neither could the woman next to her. She started slinging meat onto the tortilla, making my decision for me, I asked that they do the burrito enchilada style. Nope. Didn't happen. I have no idea what my burrito is, and it's definitely not done enchilada style. The cashier offered to make it again, but I didn't want to hold up the very long line, I should have brushed up on my Espanol before coming in.

I just left this place. The nail tech argued with me about what package I chose, when I asked that they use the grater instead of the sponge he told me that there were "no upgrades." So I ended up paying $22 for what is tantamount to a polish change and I'm absolutely outraged. I received a $6 service. They could learn a thing or two about customer service, and they certainly won't be getting my business ever again.

I'm not typically a sweets eater. I usually prefer savory to sweet, I'd rather have dinner than dessert any day. I crave pie maybe once a year, and today was that yearly occurrence.   I've been wanting to try Mamma Toledo's ever since I had brunch at Short Leash about a week ago. My friend and I were having serious sweet tooth cravings so off we went in pursuit of pie.   I find it to be slightly odd that Mamma Toledo's is located inside of the short leash restaurant, and that hasn't really been touched on very much in other reviews. When I called to see if Mamma Toledo's was open before heading out, no one answered. We took a risk and headed down anyway.   There were so many delicious options, it was mind blowing. We almost went home with four different varieties. We settled on two, apple crumble and chocolate cherry creme respectively. Although, I think we both wish that we had taken home a brown sugar peach and a pecan as well. If only Mamma Toledo's served pie by the bite. What a wonderful world that would be. I'm sincerely concerned about becoming a Type II Diabetic with Mamma's being so nearby.   Mamma, please consider selling pie by the bite, my waistline and taste buds would be appreciative. I can't wait to go back, Mamma Toledo's may have created a pie-eating monster.

Short Leash? Yes please! I had the pleasure of having brunch at Short Leash on Sunday. They have the best bloody mary's ever. I'm absolutely in love with their blue cheese olives and spicy green beans. Mon Diue. I could eat an entire jar of those green beans willingly, and free of shame.  I am not really a hot dog eater (I read The Jungle and haven't been able to eat them since) so I ordered home fries which were delightfully delicate and crispy (it tasted like they were cooked in duck fat) and a breakfast sandwich. Which was also delightful and delicious. The menu had lots of items that catered to my vegetarian friends, and everyone seemed super happy with their orders.   I've been looking for a better brunch spot since I moved downtown and I finally found it! Good drinks, great service, wonderful food. You should go!

Meh. This place is okay. I'm sure it's a nice lunch spot for businesses in the area, it wasn't the sit down place that it appeared to be. The staff wasn't very helpful with suggestions or directions and I probably won't be going back. There were a few things I didn't like, they served their guacamole on a bed of chips instead of in a bowl, which made them soggy. They used a pre made guacamole, which sucked. We had to ask them to put ice in the ice machine. Over all it wasn't a great experience. I'd pass on it and go somewhere else.

Umm I like Authentic Ethio African restaurant a lot better. I ordered from here only because they were willing to deliver. The restaurant immediately asked for more time, so whatever I knew it would take more than an hour no big deal. After leaving extremely detailed instructions As to how to get to my house, I get a phone call because the driver is lost. Very, very, lost. So I have to walk around my complex barefoot in a robe looking for this person and when I find her she refuses to listen to me when I tell her to stop driving and that I'm coming to get the food out of the car. If I had known it was going to be a goose chase I would have gone somewhere else. The delivery person was nice, and I tipped her VERY well, but it defeated the purpose of getting delivery. So unprofessional! The food itself is ok, I got the Tickle gomen it was so bland and it's like I got charged $9 for steamed cabbage with injera. The Gomen Besiga is flavorful, but tough. I wish they offered berebere stew, and that their dishes had better descriptions. I'm giving them an extra star simply for offering delivery and sometimes you just want to stay home, have Ethiopian food delivered and watch game of thrones. Not thrilled, probably not going back, definitely not eating the Tickle Gomen.
