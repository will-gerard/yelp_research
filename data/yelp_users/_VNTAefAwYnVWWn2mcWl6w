Great 'mom & pop' spot.  I always come here and I've never had a bad experience.   The place looks to be an old Filiberto's building but the inside is really nice.  The plants, decor, music, and the sound of running water from a little fountain makes this place very relaxing and comforting.   I've tried a few different things on the menu and while not everything is great, the teriyaki chicken is on point. Never fails me. Plus the owners are always nice.  This is one of those places that I default to when I can't decide on where to have my lunch.

I got married and I chose this place for tuxedos for myself and my groomsmen. Their employees are well dressed and presentable and the (Chandler) store, though small, is quite appealing in a way that I thought my experience there was going to be personal. That made me feel like I went to the right place. The clothes that I purchased are of good quality for a decent price. With all that's said, I'm still giving them a low rating because of a bad experience.  First, measurements we're off. I guess my party should have made time for another fitting but our schedules didn't allow it. While the groomsmen only had one fitting, I went for two fittings and my jacket sleeves still ended up a bit short (too much of my undershirt sleeve was showing on my wrist.) As for everyone else, there was something off with their attires, whether it was the length of sleeves, chest width, length of pants, or size of undershirt. I will say that our orders weren't picked up until a couple of days before the wedding and most of us didn't even get to try on our entire outfit until the day before the wedding. We trusted too much in them and didn't give ourselves time to correct any errors.  In addition to that was that as the groom, I was offered an upgraded undershirt to go with the tuxedo. They have a stock of basic undershirts for my groomsmen but the one I was offered had to be ordered and I didn't notice until the day before the wedding that the shirt he gave me was a different shade of white as the groomsmen's undershirts. I went back to the store to let them know of the error and he insisted that that was the color I wanted... even though I told him that I wanted everyone to match with the exception of me having a different pocket square. The employee (Alladin) seemed dismissive and had an "oh well, your fault" attitude and wasn't able to offer any help and I had to buy another undershirt for $50.   For future brides and grooms, please give yourself a lot of time during this process where you can go back multiple times for fittings and alterations to make sure clothes fit correctly. We failed to do that so as a result, all 8 of us had a fitting issue with what we purchased. Maybe I'm being too harsh even though I made the mistake of not giving myself more time to fix things but there were just too many mistakes in the process and their employees could have handled it more graciously.

BEST PHO IN TOWN. Hands down. I've eaten at pretty much all the known Pho restaurants in the valley and nothing compares to theirs. No other place has broth that is as flavorful.  Another thing is that I always get soy bean milk with my meals and it's great here and it's homemade! (None of that canned drink business.) Also, service is great and the staff is super friendly.. and I think one of them is a major Lebron fan so some of you out there might be in for some great conversations. Enjoy!

I've been here a few times and Zipps has never done me wrong.   Great place to go for games with multiple TVs and a lively crowd.   Also, they have Nightly Specials (food & drinks) from 8pm to Close everyday and the Golden wings are delicious!

I've had the worst experience with Pep Boys just within the last few months. I initially went due to a Check Engine light, which turned out to be an Evap Leak and a $350 repair. My first visit was pretty standard. I went in, they did diagnostics, I approved the repair, and I picked up my car the next day.   Less than two months later, the Check Engine light came on again, same code. I had them look at it and I was told that there was just a "kink in one of the lines" and that it would b fixed. I was hoping that that was the end of that.   From that time, again in about a month and a half, same Check Engine light came on, with the same code. Again, I paid Pep Boys another visit. It would be my last.   In addition to the same recurring problem, I also wanted to get my car checked because of a SMALL oil leak. This is where things got bad. I took my car in on a Wednesday morning, when they said it wasn't busy at all and that they'd give me a call in a few hours about what's going on with my vehicle. I didn't hear back until the evening, when I decided to call and ask about it. When I called, I asked about my car's status, was put on hold for so long that I decided to hang up and just call back. That happened 4 times in about two hours. Finally, someone was able to talk to me about my car. I was told that the oil leak was from multiple sources and that it was going to be a $670 job and they'd of course have to keep my car for another day. My schedule didn't allow that so I just picked my car up and planned on going back on the weekend. Btw, they didn't have time to check on the Check Engine issue...  The following day, I noticed when I left work that I had left a puddle of oil. On the way home, my car stopped accelerating and I was stranded. Luckily, I was stranded near an auto shop and I had them check my car. Turns out, the pipe from wherever my transmission fluid was coming from was loose. I asked Pep Boys what they did and I was told that they just tried to tighten it (but loosened it up in the process?) The new shop was able to do that with no problem, replaced the fluid,  and was able to fix the the other leaks for $110. It's been a couple of weeks and I still haven't noticed any leaks. In regards to the Check Engine light, it was just turned off and I was advised to have them do diagnostics if it comes back. Diagnostics that they offer for free, while Pep Boys charges $100. I also had to pay for the oil leak diagnostics at Pep Boys, and tried to use a coupon I received via email but was told that I had to print out my coupon to use it. I've actually presented an online coupon before at that store and someone was able to scan a printed copy, however, the clerk made it apparent that he didn't like his job anyway so that probably would've been too much to ask of him.

Best Filipino food on this side of the States.  Initially a "turo-turo" style restaurant where they have different daily selections that they make all day and you just walk up and pick what to put on your plate. While they still do that, they've expanded their menu with various appetizers, "Pulutan" dishes (food to eat while drinking alcohol), and the ever so popular "Silog" plates, which are different meats served with garlic rice and eggs. Some favorites are the sizzling Sisig and the Tapsilog.   Also with the name Halo-Halo Kitchen one can expect, well... Halo-Halo. one of the most (if not the most) popular Filipino desserts. Sweet, delicious and refreshing. Along with desserts, they also sell Philippine-brand chips and candy that bring you that much more closer and connected to the Filipino culture.   It's a great establishment owned by a respectable family that is quite involved in the Filipino community in Arizona. Aside from serving amazing food, they offer passport and money transfer to their Filipino customers. H2K has become a staple in the Filipino community in the Phoenix Area.

Gent's is a new and exciting boxing gym in the peoria area!   I recently became a member and I love it there.  Gent's has only been open for a few months and it seems that the number of members is steadily increasing.  It's filled with easy-going, fun guys and girls who are engaged in each other's dedication to being healthy and commitment to hone their boxing skills.    The facility is great.  It's spacious and there's a variety of boxing and fitness equipement that are all new: free weights, exercise machines, different types of bags, conditioning equipment, and a boxing ring.     Also, this place is quite inexpensive compared to other boxing clubs.  Only $60/month!  Like i said, the people are great.  There's definitely a sense of camaraderie, including the owner/trainer, Johnny.  I've had the chance to train closely with him.  He's an experienced boxer who is very knowledgable about the sport and is really passionate about this lifestyle and this establishment.    I highly recommend for people to come in and experience what Gent's has to offer!

Such a great experience. The fiancé and I haven't been out on a date in a while and this was the perfect spot to go to.   Nice location. Nice structure. Interior design and decor is cute (as she would say) and sophisticated. Food and service was absolutely amazing.   Everything we ordered was great. We seem to love starting our meals with dips and their Kale and Garlic Dip was an awesome pick. Served with pita, which you can't go wrong with, and wheat crackers, which I thought complimented the flavors of the dip really well. For our entrees, we ordered the Korean Style Steak and the Braised Short Rib. Both were phenomenal. (Note: Our waiter was excellent in describing the entrees. His descriptions were mouth-watering!) The Korean steak was served with fried green beans over vegetable fried rice. It actually had some hints of Vietnamese and Thai flavors, but that just added to how much we loved it. The braised rib was really amazing. I was very impressed with how it was prepared. Already off the bone, and the meat just slides off with each bite. Everything it was served with were perfect, especially the bits of blue cheese.   Drinks selection is quite decent. There were several beers to choose from and the wine list seemed pretty standard for high-end restaurants. In addition is their House Browns. It's a selection of different whiskeys from different regions of the world. We are both whiskey drinkers and practicing connoisseurs (hah!) so we enjoyed that.   Again, service was awesome. Welcoming host and friendly waiter who was very knowledgable about the contents of the menu. When my fiancé ordered whiskey and he saw that she didn't really like what she ordered, he immediately offered to replace it with a glass of another type.   Sure it's a bit pricey, but I hope you are aware of that before you walk in. I have nothing negative to say about The Henry. Loved it there!

I've been to GOGI on multiple occasions. Food is always great, but I always thought that the service was just ok. Everyone there is as friendly as can be but at busy times they just seem to be all over the place, rushing and sometimes forgetting things. My recent experience with them though has completely won me over.  A few months ago i went there with some family and friends, at least 15 of us. It was a busy  night and we were seated in the patio. They didn't seem like they could handle all the tables there that night and was really slow throughout the whole dinner: providing utensils, bringing out food, ringing up the bill. They realized that they provided poor service and promised us 20% off on our next visit (written on a receipt.)   Months after that night, I went back with my family. Same large party, but completely different experience. We expected to just have the same dishes that we normally get (we can't get enough of that Sweet Pork Belly.) Soon after we placed our orders we realized that they remembered us from last time we visited. While we waited for our orders, they brought a few things for us to try. Steamed egg, seafood pancakes, and chicken katsu salad. They said that they wanted to make up for last time and that those were all on the house. Service was much better this time around with multiple waiters being attentive and when we got the check, they already took 20% off and just asked me to turn in the note he gave us last time.   Like I said, food is always great here. What they lacked in customer service in previous visits they more than made up for this time around. It was a classy gesture and I appreciate that they appreciate their customers.
