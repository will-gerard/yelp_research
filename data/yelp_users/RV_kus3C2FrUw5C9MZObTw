My dog and I love Sherry's Pampered Pets. They are able to book last minute day care trips as well as making sure he has plenty of play time with the other dogs. I take my dog here for daycare trips just because! Even better is the super affordable grooming, every time my St.Bernard mix comes homes, he super soft and sleepy which is good for him and me!

I will never shop at this location EVER AGAIN. The shop is HUGE, they get that. The staff however, exceptionally rude to the point I called corporate. I get that it's the holiday seasons, and they are busy around Halloween, but the customer service here is lacking extremely.  Little back story..I purchased two costumes before Halloween. I called 3 stores around me and asked if I could exchange, not return, my costumes for something else. All 3 stores told me that was possible and I could even exchange for anything Halloween, including bagged candy. On my way home from the PV area I stopped at this Party City. I had my receipt in hand and approached a worker and asked her to confirm the same story I got from 3 other people. She confirmed... anything in the store including bagged candy, just had to be 40 dollars. I do my shopping, 5 minutes later shes the one to check me out. All smooth sailing until the Manager (long black hair, purple shirt, pointy brown nails) walks by and the clerk asks her to do the exchange. The manager throws a fit saying I cannot get candy, even though her staff just told me it was ok. She threw a fit and took the candy and tossed it behind the counter saying I needed to go get more Halloween stuff. I told her 4 (FOUR) people had told me it was ok. I even showed her the phone numbers of the stores I contacted. She proceeded to tell me her staff doesn't know what they are talking about and apparently have different policies and procedures throughout all of Party City because they are franchise (first I've ever heard of that nonsense).   So here I go, back to go find 30 dollars of useless stuff because I can't get what I was told I could. Finally get things with a Halloween look to them (candy is excluded here too). I wait in line and I get to a male cashier. He tells me "so you know there is a no return or exchange policy right, all sales are final." I'm like yes, but I am doing an exchange. He says "no no no all sales final." Proceeds to shake his head frantically and laughing at me. Now I'm livid. He finally understands that I am conducting an exchange and throws a temper tantrum, threw the phone on the counter after calling a manager and huffed in the background drinking his slurpy raging mad. So now I'm like wow.... that's professional. Same manager comes up. She takes my receipt and starts slamming her fingers on the computer. Doesn't even say a word to me. Then tells me I'm 2 dollars short, and I can buy single candy below. SERIOUSLY!   I could of been fine with the miscommunication of the staff here, and the fact that they make their own rules apparently. But of the 3 people I dealt with only ONE was nice to me. Save your money and go to Spirit. They at least like their job and customers.

Dr. Saunders is amazing.   And again.... another lacking of the front office staff.  The blond receptionist who has her butt planted firmly on the left side of the window, I'm not sure how she has her job. She is exceptionally RUDE. My first time coming in and not even a "hello" or a "How can I help you." I stood at the window listening to her chat away for a good 2 minutes before I finally decided to help myself to the sign in process. She finally realized I was standing there and still didn't say a thing. Just opened the glass and took the paper I wrote on then demanded my insurance card and co payment. I've been into the office 3 times in the past month, and guess what.... she doesn't get any nicer. I have however witnessed her hung over on a Saturday, and I've even witnessed her in a stuffing her mouth phase.Please don't let my need to see a doctor get in your way of eating.

The only reason why I go to this salon is Topaz. I would (and have) followed her all over Phoenix just to make sure I get a good hair cut. Topaz has been cutting my hair for about 5 years and she is the only one I would let cut my hair.

Very disappointed. Ate here for the first time, and would have preferred a grilled cheese sandwich. The tacos were flavorless, the guac was flavorless. We were also flavorless. Spent 8 dollars for 4 tacos is a little excessive especially when they were nothing to brag about. And 6 dollars for a small basket of chips and guac! Service was fine considering the girl didn't know what to charge us. The place also smelled like bleach and bathroom cleaner. Not holding my breath that we will return to any of their locations.

Love this dentist office! I couldn't be happier. I went in for an initial cleaning, nothing unusual. The staff was very nice. They have early appointments which is great. I went in 1/22 to have my wisdom teeth pulled. The staff answered all my questions and concerns. Told me the dos and don'ts. I showed up with no anxiety.   Come 1/22. I was ready. Teeth came out, fillings in. Dr. Nack personally called me that night to make sure I was ok and answer any other questions. Went in a few days later for a check up. Today (1/27) I am almost 100% back to eating normal and minimal swelling. I am so happy I found this dentist and his staff. I am very impressed. Def a return client and I'm suggesting them to everyone!!

I am really picky when it comes to Sushi, and this place is amazing. The food is really fresh, and of course they make more than just sushi. My favorite is the Monkey Rolls. I love that you can come in here, and all of the staff is polite and they don't bug you while you are eating. Most of all, we love the prices and the variety of sushi!

Slowest drive thru ever. You have to plan to sit in the drive thru in the Am for at least 10 min. Half the time they can never get my order right and I get the same thing every day.

I've been here once for a tattoo and returned for a nose piercing all because of Mandy! As soon as you walk in the door she greets you and has a no judgment about whatever tattoo idea or piercing idea you have. She's super sweet and will make sure you are comfortable with whatever work you get. I got my nose piercing from her and she explained the whole process from the piercing to the after care and listened to whatever weird questions or concerns I had. Everyone at Ace is personable and there is no such thing as a stranger. I can't wait to return to get more tattoos from their very talented artists!

I love Zipps, we have their wings at least once a month, and they have a great happy  hour selection. The reason why this location gets 2 stars is their lack of customer service. The waitresses are rude, and not just rude like they need more training but rude like they hate their job. It's gotten so bad lately, that we actually decide not to do business here, just because we can never get a waitress that doesn't have an attitude. Disappointing really.

Love grabba green. Just not their prices. 20 bucks for a small grain bowl (all priced at 10) and a smoothie at 7.
