Amber is great :) I always get highlights/lowlights and even have her cut/color my clip-in extensions. I decided to go with a nice salon finally after a "stylist" I found on craiglist butchered my highlights. Amber fixed my hair and I'll continue going here :) It's worth it to spend extra money to have a job well done.

I will not be purchasing Frontier airline tickets in the near future.  I missed my flight from Phx to SFO because the TSA at the Phoenix airport would not allow "mobile" boarding passes.  Since I missed my flight, Frontier would not refund me any fees, and also would not transfer my fees to another airline to get on the next available flight. In fact, they charge you $75 to "hold" your money from the flight if you want to save it - that's well above any "hidden fees" other airlines might have. I will definitely think twice before flying Frontier. Lastly, every employee of Frontier that I spoke with was unaccommodating and lacking any compassion. They withheld helpful information and those employees will be getting reviews from me as well.
