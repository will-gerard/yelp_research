Evette I'm sorry but these guys are amazing! I had a problem with my safe lock too and Sean (I think his name is) came out and told me it wasn't what we thought in the first place and fixed my safe lock in 10 min! So you have to pay for them to come (I think it was $50or so) but they know what they are doing. I would rather have someone that knows what they are doing than me thinking I know and messing it up more. When your lock breaks again in a few months call a pro next time Evette. I have also used them for my rental property for re-keys and such. They are always on time and it is always a fair and honest price.

This is the best hidden lunch spot! Everything is always so fresh and exactly how I ask for it. You almost feel like you went to your parents for a home cooked lunch.

NO ONE USE LISA'S RUM CAKE UNLESS YOU WANT THE WORST SERVICE IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so upset! My mom called to get a quote on a delivery charge for a cake for my shower, she called me to tell me how much it was and how mean this lady was who she spoke with. I was so shocked to here that, that I wanted to call and verify thinking that the lady maybe just missed quoted or was having a bad day. NOPE, I asked her how she based her pricing because my mom just called and she started yelling at me that I was a bi%@h and so was my mother for even asking. WTF! I will never NEVER go to Lisa's Rum Cake again. It is sad too because we used to get all of our cakes from there and I wanted my shower and wedding cake from them but nope. You call my mom names and we will have issues, say what you want about me but not about her. #badbaker #badbusiness
