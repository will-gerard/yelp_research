This Fry's is AWESOME. Holy crap, I'm so glad I moved. My old grocery store was a POS compared to this place. It almost has an AJ's feel to it. You can get pretty much anything you need here. Although there are certain items I like to get at Trader Joe's which is just right down the street. The lighting is nice, the store is clean and there are a ton of options. Two thumbs up. Way up. (My only gripe is that there is one creepy Carl who works the self-check out during week nights, but almost all grocery stores have at least one, so it isn't so bad).

Love this place! Love that there is a drive-thru, and they are super speedy and friendly. They also have several sugar-free options, which is awesome. I'll be visiting this place frequently.

It looks a little scary... okay, extremely scary, on the outside but this place is a diamond in the rough! The atmosphere is a little outdated and the smell... well, let's just say there is something funky going on there, but the food is absolutely delicious and the waitstaff is sweet and attentive. Two thumbs up!

I love the range here! The staff is friendly, it's peaceful and very relaxed for people who barely know how to hold a club (ahem, me...)

I've been to Martini Ranch a handful of times and I always have a blast! I love the location, the indoor/outdoor options and the music. Had a blast there this past weekend, but it was also due to the company.

Loved the atmosphere and great customer service, but the food was bland (at best) and the prices are too high.

Extremely unhappy with this place. After an hour long wait on my first visit, I spent another 2 hours getting X-rays and talking to a nurse practitioner. I came in for an adjustment, which I did not get. They insisted on giving me electric stim after saying I didn't want/like it. Then they told me I had to schedule another appt to have my X-rays read. I came in 3 days later to learn the "doctors" we're still on vacation and still needed to review my X-rays, but in the meantime, they came up with a $1500 treatment plan to cure what they didn't even know was wrong. They had a billing specialist explain the treatment plan, which I thought odd, and she kept mentioning how I shouldn't worry because my insurance would take care of most of it. Then she got extremely defensive, argumentative and rude when I said I didn't agree with the treatment plan ESPECIALLY because they were trying to "treat" something she previously said I didn't need, not to mention the "doctors" still needed to look at my X-rays. Finally, extremely irritated, she threw her hands up and said "fine! What do you want then!?" She told me I had to schedule yet another spot to have my X-rays read. When checking out, the receptionist tried to up sell me on a massage the "therapists" said I didn't need.   This place clearly only cares about how much they can bill your insurance and how many times they can get you in per week to get copays. I have never experienced anything like this in my 20 years of chiropractic care.   I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.

This, by far, is one of my favorite places in the Valley. The beer is amazing, the food is fantastic and the service is stellar. Hell, I'd move in if they'd let me!

I think I'm in love. Is it too soon to say it?...Terri was referred by a close friend and I couldn't be happier with my JET BLACK hair (which I would have never considered in my life before). My hair was extremely damaged from the Coppola Keratin Treatment I got 3 months ago at another salon, and Terri not only revived it, but elevated the color and texture beyond my wildest dreams. I think I may have asked Terri to move in to my house at some point. I don't know, I blacked out with joy. I highly recommend her to ANYONE. Her skills are sharp, she doesn't mind staying late to help a girl in need and she is an absolute joy to spend 2 hours with. Thank you Terri!!! (and thank you Tara for recommending her!)

I'm not much of a gambler, but when I saw this place open up I thought, "why not." I'll save you from having to ask yourself this by telling you that the food is not good. I ordered a salad and a Las Vegas roll and the salad just never came out. I kept expecting it before my sushi (which I had to choke down), and finally I had to go ask for it. The staff did feel bad, but the place was COMPLETELY EMPTY.  I won't be visiting Cafe Wasabi again.

Best. Thai food. Ever.  My boyfriend and I discovered this place on Christmas (it was the only place nearby that was open). I think we went back 5 times in the next month after that! The food is THAT good and I am not a huge fan of thai. I recommend to anyone in the mood for thai food, novice to experienced!

I love this place! It is so cozy, nestled next to the Greenbelt, and close to my house! The food is amazing, the service is friendly and it's a great place to meet for a date, or happy hour to catch up with friends. I highly recommend!

Bland. While the decor is lovely and the customer service was above average, the food was just not impressive. I was disappointed, because the menu left much to desire. If you want some seriously great Thai food, try the Pink Pepper in Mesa.

Best service I have had in a LONG time! Holy amazing is what this staff is. Our food arrived in less than 15 minutes of ordering, the drinks were prompt and our waitress checked on us the perfect amount of times. And the food was amazing too! Dinner and dessert - both amazing. I really dig this place and hope to hit it up soon again. I can't stress how fantastic the staff were!

So thankful for Dr. Senter and her staff! My pug receives excellent care and they don't "make up" problems to solve for your pet unlike many vets in the Valley. We had a terrible experience with Paws Veterinary before this and I was very skeptical about finding a vet we could trust. Dr. Senter and staff were a pleasant surprise. I recommend this vet to anyone in the East Valley!

This place is fantastic. I love the old school Vegas-y feel to it and the dj playing all the throwback hip hop pretty much made my night. The bathrooms are clean. Holly, our VIP hostess was all kinds of awesome. I will definitely be heading back to Mabels! Ladies - thank you for an awesome night. That was probably the most fun I've had in a very long time!

No better place on a Sunday! The bottomless mimosas are one of the best deals in town, and they usually have a great dj. The service can be spotty, but this past weekend our server was on point! My glass was never empty! Oh... the food is good too!

Definitely a cool place. Unfortunately I was getting kind of tired by the time we made our way here, so I couldn't rock out to my full potential. The music was great, the vibe reminded me of a college night in Vegas (not a bad thing!) and I wish I would have stayed longer to get the full effect. But don't worry Smashboxx, we're not done yet.

I think I'm in love. The service is great, the atmosphere is awesome and the drinks are TASTY. The waiter also let us in on a little secret, they can make a patron/pineapple margarita that isn't on the menu. YUM.

What the hell happened to this place!? Man, what a dump it has become. The service is absolutely awful. It was freezing in there the entire time, so much, that I had to wear my jacket for the painful hour I was in there. Our drinks came out about 20 minutes after we ordered them. Our appetizer came out first and we had A)No drinks B)No water C)No silverware. You would have thought it was our waitress' first night on the job - it was terrible. I will not be going back any time soon. And seriously, fix your decorations! They look like crap and they're falling apart. PS, the food was not great either. Such a bummer, I used to like this place.

I freaking love this place! They have a great happy hour, and SPARKLY COUNTERTOPS. The service is usually pretty great and it's in a prime location. Did I mention the SPARKLY COUNTERTOPS yet? Cause I really love those.

This is my third and second favorite of all the Majerle's locations. I went to watch football with a bunch of dudes. It was fun! The screens are fancy, the waitresses were on top of their game and the bathrooms were clean. I'll definitely hit up Majerle's again!

In the 30 minutes I was at Casablanca, I was underwhelmed. To say the least. The service is absolute shit. It's a really great atmosphere and there was an amazing live band and I even liked the light-up menus, but the service killed it for me. The manager tried to come over and salvage an experience that was spiraling downward for myself and seven other girls. She made it worse. Trying to get our checks sorted out was a nightmare. I almost felt sorry for our server because she clearly wasn't capable or prepared to handle a table of eight. We were told she was new by the manager, which I also didn't like. Why would you assign a new server to a group? She didn't know what was in the drinks and wasn't familiar with the menu. One of the girls in our group had to flag down the manager just to get my one (and only) round of drinks. I'd love to give this place another shot if they can invest in better service. The company, however, was fabulous! To all the ladies out on Saturday night, I had a blast with you all! Despite the Casablanca shitstorm. Does anyone know the name of the band that was playing there on Saturday? I'd definitely love to see them again (at another venue!).

I can't believe it took me so long to discover this place! This place kicks ass! I ran by this place every day for a year and always wondered what was going on... well, let me tell you - this place is worth the visit. The food is amazing, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is superb and it is just all around enjoyable. Two thumbs up. My only minor, minor wish would be that the menu would have more options - but what they do have is magnificent!
