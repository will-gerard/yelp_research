I had went here a few months ago. I wasn't even going to leave a bad review, but a buddy of mine went to the same store and had an issue with the same person, so here we go. The owner (John), completely unprofessional. Rude. How does UPS give this guy a franchise and let him represent them?? Fed Ex all the way from now on. The employees are dumb as rocks and the owner has no sense of customer service. Save yourself the headache and frustration, go ANYWHERE else but here. Wish I could give it ZERO stars.

Dopest Saturday nights in the valley with Solstice Saturdays spinning dope hip hop and R&B downstairs with the House bumpin upstairs. No need to look anywhere else for your diverse crowd and fun night.

Best place to go dance on Saturday nights. Dopest hip hop on the bottom floor, open roof top playing house music all night until 3 am. Yes there's a cover, but if you come with a large party, talk to the door guy, he'll take care of you. Cheap drinks, cute bartenders, loud music, good times!

If you're a Military Veteran, the spouse of a Veteran, or even a VA Nurse, Chamberlain College has an amazing Military Dept. All of the counselors are Vets too and they understand the jargon/lingo. There's a Military Tuition Rate also that you'll qualify for if you meet the criteria. Tuition for the Online RN-BSN goes down almost 30%. Is it expensive, sure....it's not the cheapest school on the block. However, it IS a single purpose Nursing school, so all the teachers and the Dean are Nursing professionals. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd be happy to assist ANY Vet, spouse of Vet or VA Nurse. I love this place.

Great barber, provides comic relief while you're getting your cut. Takes his time with the clippers and precise. Be sure to ask about getting a massage while you're there! I've been coming to this shop for a couple of years. Takes credit card if you don't have cash. Check it out!

I just got off of the phone with Carissa the owner. This lady decided it would be professional to talk in a condescending fashion to a potential customer. We were discussing the $79 diagnostic fee, and I was telling her that I didn't want to pay $80 to have somebody come out and tell me that all I have to do is turn on the gas line or put gas in it or whatever. I understand if the fireplace legitimately has an issue that needs a technician to repair it, at that point I have no problem paying a diagnostic fee or even repairs, but if it were to be a simple solution that would take 5 minutes, I don't want to have to pay $80 for that. Obviously, I am unfamiliar with gas fireplaces.  The one star review isn't about their work, I'm not sure what kind of work they do, but the owner needs to learn how to talk to customers in a respectful manner. I felt like I was being chastised by a parent.  Carissa's response to our discussion was, "Well, can YOU figure out what the issue is?" My obvious response was "no", then she says "Riiiiight..."... really lady? Like you have people waiting in line to pay you 80 bucks to go look at their units??? Any kind of owner that treats a potential client like that will never get my business, I'm not sure how you've lasted this long with you answering the phones Carissa, hopefully you have administrative assistant that has more courtesy and respect than you do.  The $79 diagnostic fee isn't even the issue anymore, it's just the way that Carissa decided to handled the conversation. Blah!
