Food was amazing!  Enough said.  My kid who is a picky eater hammered through his food and wanted more.

Checked in online for a 345 time slot. Got here at 320 to fill out the paperwork and now it is 415 and I'm still in the waiting room. Plus, they keep it extremely hot in here. This is incredibly painful.

First time, last time.  First time ordering from here and it will be the last time.  I ordered 1 large pizza and a 2-liter bottle of coke.  Was told it would take 45 mins for delivery.  Ok.  I called at 5:51 on a Thursday.  Pizza did not get delivered until 7:14.  AN  HOUR AND 23 MINUTES LATER!  Called to get the status on it at 6:59.  Told he left 5 minutes ago and he should be here any minute.  15 minutes later he arrived.  I live less that a quarter mile away.    Got the pizza and of course it was cold.  On top of that, I wasn't impressed by the taste of it.  Domino's is better.  Never again will I get food from this place again.
