Ryan's isn't exactly a secret but I didn't know about it until recently. Any phx pet owner really should know about this warehouse. Why pay twice as much for a crate, leash, toy, etc at a normal store? Besdies food and some specialty items, I will buy everything here from now on!

Ok, so I haven't actually been to this location. I just had the BBQ from their tent at the Tempe Art Festival. When I got there the BBQ rib tips weren't ready yet. Mark Smith actually delivered them a couple blocks away to my office when they were ready, and he included extras. Such wonderful service, so nice! The BBQ sauce was amazing and I want to head to one of the full-menu locations to try their ribs. mmm

Sweet Milly went in for her first vet appointment with Dr.Soltero this morning. Saguaro Veterinary clinic was highly recommended by her breeder. The staff were all very friendly, the location was welcoming and they were so nice to answer a lot of questions for me. I'd recommend this clinic to anyone.

Saguaro is still great as ever! Milly has been having some..errr...poo problems. I went in this morning and it ended up being nothing and a very short visit - so Dr. Soltero only charged me for the labs and not the visit - how nice!

My first impression of Parkway Medical was that the front office wasn't all that fancy and I had a couple run ins with some rude receptionists (and one run in with a horrible PA). But, after a year or so I found the doctor that is right for me, and I feel very comfortable with Parkway Medical. What is great is that they have excellent hours, I love my doctor (Dr. Jennifer McMahon) and there actually are some nice receptionists that work there. You can check out their site and read bios on all their doctors as well. Also, they have great Urgent Care hours - so you can go to the same place for your primary doctor as you do for urgent care.

This Safeway is nice and is close to my house, but after visiting this weekend I have to stay I am going to stick with Bashas. The prices are definitely higher on my normal items at Safeway. Also, I know Safeway can't really control this, but the vibe is not as friendly. The parking lot was packed, there were grumpy folks looking for spots. This is the same Safeway that my husband was at when a guy and his girlfriend walked up to him and offered him $5 to help get him a hair cut. My husband's hair wasn't even that long (maybe an inch or two). I don't know what it is that draws that type of crowd, but Bashas has a much more home-town feel.

I was referred to Laser for Less by a friend who has completed treatments and had great results. I had looked at some other places and they were way more expensive. Ideal Image was a couple grand even at 50% off!! crazy. When I am all said and done, I will have spent way less here. The location is cute, clean and up to date. I have the same girl every time and she is super nice. I would definitely recommend Laser for Less to anyone. It does hurt though - really bad! I am a baby though :)

Today was my first experience with Schumacher and it was great - I visited the service department and was greeted with a gift bag. I easily got a loaner car and headed to work. When I came back, it was a simple process and everyone was very helpful. The service and cashier folks were very nice and made sure I got some Easter candy. All around, a great experience and friendly people.

I was a little hesitant about going here due to the look (silly me, my favorite place Los Dos Molinos is the same way), but I am glad I did. The employees were very, very friendly. The cheese crisp was really good, one of the better cheese crisps I had. Sopapillas were good - better than average but not as doughy as I love. Good place all around.

I love both the food and atmosphere of the breakfast club in old town Scottsdale. I usually order pancakes, bacon and eggs with fresh OJ. This place is always super busy since its pretty small (and popular) - so be prepared to wait at least 30-45 minutes (which is sometimes a pain). Delicious breakfast.

I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING (see my reviews on them)! They are the real reason I love the salon, but I'll also say it has a cute atmosphere, everyone is friendly and it is located pretty centrally in old town Scottsdale. The salon also features a restaurant, which I can't comment on because I am too picky to like anything on the menu, but I am sure it is delish.

The Spa at Camelback Inn is one of my favorite places in Arizona. The resort is beautiful and the spa is amazing. The grounds of the spa are gorgeous and tranquil. The Swedish massage is the best I have ever had. Even the shampoo and hand soap smell delicious - I had to buy them for myself. A day here takes away all my worries. I am addicted!

We headed to Lon's last night for a client dinner and the weather was perfect. We sat outside on the gorgeous patio - luxurious but laid back. The service was great and the food was as well. I had the short ribs and seasonal vegetables. The short ribs were amazing, as were the baby carrots.

Today was my first visit to the Willow Stream Spa. The facilities were great - very beautiful. I loved the waterfall and the pool, although the spa pool is somewhat of a small area and it was hard to find a spot. My massage was amazing - I loved that the door was open to a private patio and you could hear the waterfall.   Although spa week is a great time to try new spas, it means a lot of people are doing the same. The locker room was so crowded it was uncomfortable, there were tons of people all over making it loud and less relaxing, and there were not any good spots left at the pool. I ended up leaving right after my massage because I just wasn't really relaxed. Because the facilities were gorgeous and the massage was great, I am going to come back and take advantage of summer specials - hopefully it will be less crowded and more relaxing. I'll update my review then!

After the original cafe we had scheduled our book club at was closed, we decided to do brunch at Z'Tejas. The brunch options were kind of blah. I wanted to get peanut butter (or Jam) for my english muffin, but they didn't have any. I thought I'd try the french toast but didn't when they let me know that they didn't have syrup.   There are so many AMAZING breakfast and brunch spots in AZ, there really is no reason at all to go to Z Tejas for brunch. Maybe they should stick to lunch and dinner.

I am not a huge slices fan, but let me start by saying I know a lot of people who are. I've gone in for a slice at lunch and each time find that the pizza is a bit cold and has been sitting there for a while - doesn't look that great. The location is crowded and waiting in line is uncomfortable. Also, not that they can control this, but I want to gag walking to and from because I have to pass by Hippie Gypsy and that nasty incense smell makes me loose my appetite. Let me conclude by saying the pizza is not all that bad though.

I have two dobies, and they are the loves of my life. One has some leash-reactivity issues and can be quite the sassy pants. Two years ago I left her at partners while I was away on business and vacation for two weeks, and she did their camp. She did lose some weight because she hates being crated/kenneled, but that would have happened anywhere. She learned a lot of great skills, and it was the first time I could get her to actually walk on a leash without pulling like crazy. She still is a sassy pants, but she knows her commands perfectly and is very impressive with her commands. We've been attending weekly class now for about a year and a half - which is very affordable because we did the camp. I think it is only $10/class. I find this really helpful to keep her consistent and she has gone from level one to level two. During her time in level two, she has tested and passed to receive her AKC Canine Good Citizen certification.   I work in the rescue world, so I know that there are A LOT of passionate opinions about different methods of training. Dog people can get really opinionated, and I don't think any one trainer or method is commonly loved by all. It can be tiring and every trainer thinks they are right. I am not saying other methods are wrong, just that I believe Partners has a pretty good approach and uses positive training as its basis with lots of other stuff that I won't try to explain.   I also think it is important to mix in at home training and "fun" training like agility, dock-diving, etc which partners has.   I also appreciate that partners supports the rescue community.   There are a couple people who are extra special to my dobie girl at partners - she loves Lynn, Kerstin, Leighton and Jennifer.

I was really excited to try Carefree Station, as I love Carefree and that type of atmosphere. We went with friends who said their bunch was very good. The outside patio seemed lovely, and we sat inside. It smelled a little bit walking in (pee-ish), but no biggie. I was excited to meet our friends and try the breakfast/brunch. The waitress asked us if there were any questions about the menu. My boyfriend asked what they were known for and she said.."well....food." I asked if there was any way to get the french toast without the stuffing. She said no, what is on the menu is what you get. This is not "that" type of restaurant. So, it came time to order. I am admittedly very picky, and I have some food allergies/sensitivities, which is why I order things very plain. That doesn't mean I don't like to try new places and things, or that I don't love food as much as everyone else. I had looked at the menu and had found everything too "much" for me, so I asked if I could order the Crepes just completely plain. Not extra, not complicated, just a plain crepe. Something that is actually 10x easier to make then some stuffed, elaborate item. She told me she really didn't think that was possible, and that this was a private restaurant, not a "corporate" restaurant, and you can't just ask for everything customized. In my mind, I am thinking...I rarely go to chains, I frequent private restaurants all the time - from hole in the wall to the most expensive in the valley. No one ever makes such a big deal out of making me something simple.   Anyhow, she says she needs to go check, and instead brings another "senior" waitress over and asks me to repeat what I had asked for - like it was some sort of blasphemous crazy order that she can't repeat. I said "I would like a plain Crepe with nothing on it if possible" - the next waitress says "what do you mean a plain Crepe" and I clarified. They both stood there making a huge deal about it, saying how the Chef and owner would be horrified to hear this and they would get written up if they put that order in, but that they "guess" they could go back and fall on the sword for me and check. They kept blaming the owner. SO EMBARRASSING for me at this point, they are making such a big deal out of it. She comes back and says it is ok, and the other waitress says to her are you sure? She says yes. Then, I commit the horrible offense of asking for a side of fruit. She steps back and stares me down, and then says that maybe I should just go up to Albertsons! ARE. YOU. KIDDING. ME. I had been extremely nice until this point, and at that I said "I've never been to a breakfast restaurant in the country that won't serve you a side of fruit" and she then agreed to bring it to me. When my Crepe came, it had the fruit on top of it, just kind of like an extra "f-you." They also made a big deal out of one of our friends asking for onions to be left out of his burrito. Throughout our whole meal you could see the two waitresses telling other waiters of my order, with people staring.   This is not the review of a crazy angry person. I am typically very positive and understanding. You can see that I have a ton of 5-star reviews. But this was just ridiculous. They made me feel embarrassed, like a child. I am a nice, polite grown woman looking to order a plain Crepe. I'm making less work for you, and you get to make a crepe and charge me $13. If you have that much of a problem with it (which I still think would be silly), politely tell me that is not available.   The crepe was actually very good. My boyfriend's burger was "ok." I will never go back, and would recommend others avoid. I have some great breakfast/brunch recommendations if you'd like! The friends who took us there were mortified and apologized for bringing us there multiple times.

Los is one of our favorite places to go - we even held our rehearsal dinner for our wedding there. Los is authentic and fun, with friendly staff. You can't find better (or hotter) New Mexican food in Arizona.

A lot of people love Sapporo for its happy hour - which I have heard is great. Although I live in and love Scottsdale, sometimes you can find some of the more dolled up, trying a little too hard crowd here. Although there are just as many normal, fun people as well. ;) I love Sapporo for the restaurant' s teppan - the chefs are fun and the food is amazing. Sapporo serves the BEST filet i have ever, ever had. It melts in your mouth and is "to die for". You have to try Sapporo - the atmosphere is great.

I visited Delux in my search for a replacement for Induldge, which sadly closed a couple months ago. Amazing cheeseburger, great fries. The chocolate shake was way too rich (must have been haagendaz). The tables are super close together and it was packed even during an "off" time. No Indulge replacement, but a really good burger and fries - if they could just get their chocolate shake in line ;)

I've been to LGO for breakfast a couple times, but have been waiting years to finally get over there and try the pizza. I wasn't disappointed, and am definitely adding this to my list of absolute favorite pizza places. The crust, cheese, mmmm it was all amazing. LGO is also a really great atmosphere. Only downside is that parking is very difficult and if you don't know those streets very well, it is confusing to know where to park.

I work in Tempe, and every day I bring my own lunch to work - except Fridays when I get take out from PF Changs. The crispy honey chicken lunch bowl is delicious and the employees are nice. The manager is always walking around with a big smile on his face.   I'm really picky so I modify my lunch bowl to remove the sauce and other parts of the dish and to also skip the soup. So basically I eat chicken and rice and ask for some sauce on the side. Today the manager told me that I can no longer order that because they can't have people "taking advantage" of the lunchbowls with modifications. I think this stinks for two reasons - one - they are actually saving with me because I don't take the soup and accoutrements.  Two - I come there almost every week and now..I guess I don't get to anymore unless I order the full size (which is wayyy to much for this belly).   Oh well! La Bocca is delicious and it is right across the street!

Great atmosphere! Nice area and nice set up inside. Very, very friendly wait staff. The quesadilla was great as were the enchiladas. The sopapillas could have more umph to them, but they were ok. A tiny bit overpriced, but overall liked it and will go back.

I started going to New Leaf in July 2012 after looking for Isolaz providers online. The site looked reputable and the office was close by. I called and explained I wanted to buy the Isolaz package which was $550. They sold me the package and I came in for my first visit. At that visit, there was some confusion in the office and ultimately they hadn't communicated that I was a new patient which requires a visit with the doctor. So, they got that taken care of and I talked to the doctor very briefly and they had me then do a session of Isolaz. I came in for my second session (after a lot of scheduling back and forth issues) and again had the Isolaz treatment. There was a lot of trouble again getting me in, but I came in for my third session and once I was in the room, they informed me that the Isolaz was broken with no ETA on fixing it. They let me know another laser would be used on me. The doctor wasn't available to explain to me the benefits of this laser or anything about it. I went ahead and had the treatment, but let them know I wanted to meet with the doctor again to understand the treatment plan/any changes to the plan. I am trying to solve and issue, not just come in for random laser treatments. At this point there was a ton of back and forth in terms of scheduling issues, me explaining the situation and them understanding why I felt I needed to see the doctor again, etc. It was so difficult I ended up just letting it be for a couple months. Then, I called back and we got the appointment set up. I explained I wanted to see the doctor so that he could hear the various issues I was having and provide me with the best treatment plan (instead of just sticking me under this or that laser). At that appointment, he just pushed doing the laser and I couldn't clearly get a plan. Microdermabrasion came up but he mentioned I'd have to talk to someone else about that and she wasn't there (she called me the next day but was confused about what I wanted and nothing was integrated). Also, a nurse came in to ask him something and all the sudden he was gone and on to another patient without answering all my questions or issues. I don't think I ever spent more than 3-5 minutes in a room with him. After that appointment I decided just to go elsewhere. I called and explained the situation again and asked for a refund for the remainder of my package. After calling twice, and no one ever calling me back, I just gave up and wrote the money off as a loss. Then, recently I got an office visit bill for them for the second appt with the doctor I wrote about above. Before I had this appointment, they assured me because of all the issues I wouldn't be charged a visit fee. This bill required I get back into the whole situation, so I called. The receptionist had me leave a message for someone else who didn't call me back. I called again, and then was called back. I was told due to the terms and conditions they could not provide a refund but only finish the laser treatments. I let them know I didn't want to come back, but that I wanted to clear up the other bill sent to me. She wasn't able to do anything about that, so I got the billing contact who I will call tomorrow and tell the story to again. Whew! So much time on the phone and complications. I want to say that the receptionist and the lady in charge of cosmetic treatments (Natasha), as well as my laser technician (I think Sharon), were all very, very nice. The doctor was a nice guy too. The office just seems to be really unorganized, no one knows what is going on, and the doctor doesn't really care to spend any time with you. I considered writing a review a couple times over the past year, but held off because I didn't want to make a big deal about it, but at this point I've just put so much wasted time into this, I thought a fair review would be appropriate.   I did find another dermatologist who is amazing, and spent over 30 minutes in my initial meeting with me. Hopefully I can figure out this situation with New Leaf and move on, just not the right fit.

The Sanctuary Spa accommodated a big group of our clients recently. We had a great time lounging in the spa, and the attendant was so incredibly nice and attentive. The robes were very comfy and I loved the atmosphere. The Swedish massage was AMAZING. I'll definitely be back. The Spa at Camelback Inn is still my 5-star favorite, but you can't miss the Sanctuary spa, not to mention the hotel and its restaurant have some of the most amazing views in Phoenix.

In 2008, I was married at the FireSky Resort and Spa. I fell in love with the resort years ago after visiting the grounds at night - gorgeous lighting, lush greens and great atmosphere. I love the resort for its super cozy feel while still maintaining a trendy look. The fire outside is gorgeous, especially at night.   The pools are gorgeous and fun. The rooms are very cute. The location is close to a lot of great amenities. Food is great.   I have also visited the spa - which isn't all that large - so you don't get the day spa feel, but it is a nice little spa.   This place obviously holds a special place in my heart - it is amazing.

The nextcare check-in process was great and the staff members were very, very friendly. I like their simple process. Unfortunately even with an appointment I was seen 20-30 minutes late and then sat in the exam room for over an hour waiting for the doctor. 2 hours for a strep test is too long especially when there were not even others in the waiting room. I wouldn't want to be here when it is busy. Healthcare providers need to change the way they schedule. If patients need to be on time, doctors need to be on time. This experience left me feeling really frustrated on top of my sore throat. Only positive is that I don't have strep :)

I love trying new spas and was excited to experience Aviana. I would actually give this 3.5 stars if I could. It is between A-Ok and Yay! I'm a fan.  A really good spa, great for hotel guests, beautiful little pool area private to the spa. The actual massage itself was a 5-star, my therapist did a great job.   I just have my favorites that are 5 stars and this one doesn't measure up in terms of atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it to those staying in the area and are looking for a great spa service. The spa is especially nice for groups.   One small thing - the showers had the potential to be amazing (a billion and one shower heads), but they confused me a little. There were only two and they were a little too open. I felt like someone was going to walk in there and see me nakey so I rushed through my shower.

I am so torn about Bead World Scottsdale. They have the chain I need, so I go there all the time. I learned from some of their classes, and they were great. I love their 40% off weekly coupons - they are really what keeps me going back. There are a couple of really nice sales people, but there are quite a few REALLY bad sales people. I think others (based on reviews) have noticed this as well. I think Bead World could go from 2 stars to 5 if they invested in some customer service training. Some of the employees are really rude, almost annoyed by customers. It's like the company culture is that customers are just there to annoy them. So many times I have heard an employee say "I really don't know" or "I have no idea if we'll get that back in again" etc. It isn't just me, I see them be rude to other customers, like they can't wait to say no or be unhelpful, to assert their power or something. I notice this especially when people call. I've been in the store and witnessed really rude phone conversations and have called a couple times and had bad experiences. For example, I just called to check on the stock of an item, and she said "I think we have that" and I asked her to check so I didn't have to drive all the way over if they didn't, so she went to check, came back said "yes we do" and then hung up without saying goodbye or thank you before I finished thanking her for checking.   I love to support local and small businesses. I worked at one as a teen. I know that customers can be difficult sometime, but it isn't that hard to be nice, especially to customers who are being really nice to you. As I mentioned, some of the sales people are really nice. The store is nice, their coupons are great, basically the perfect 5-star set up if certain employees didn't leave such a bad taste. :)

I had lived in Arizona quite a while before I tried City Hall. I thought it was kind of just another steakhouse. When I met my boyfriend, turns out this is his favorite place. Lucky for me! They make the most exceptional filet. Mmmmm. So good. Every time. I also love the exceptional service and can't forget the amazing snap peas!

This is the most amazing Whole Foods I have ever been to. It is huge and I'd say...quite wonderful! What I love:  - The produce. I love to pick up their pre-packaged fruit when I am on the go (it is pricey though).  - The reusable bags. They are dirt cheap and cute. I have a bunch to take my lunch in, etc.  - The homeopathic products. I found Traumeel - my miracle for tendinitis -  here.  - The food bars/stations. There is a plethora of options for grabbing a quick and healthy bite to eat - I always pick up a Chinese rice bowl, but the options are SERIOUSLY endless.

I don't shop at AJ's for weekly groceries (too pricey), but I love coming to AJ's. It is so cozy and fresh. I head here with my family (I don't drink, they do) to pick up a bottle of wine, stop in to grab unique flowers for the house or pick up a specialty item. Also, I've become an obsessed regular to AJ's grill. It is outside and you can grab a quick bite while enjoying the neighborhood feel. I just love to stop in - it gives me a happy feeling.

I don't get too adventurous with mexican food, but I have trouble finding places I like and that my fellow diners like. This place is quick, and the food is good, especially for the price. The cheese crisp and sopapillas are great. Also, the service was 5 star - very friendly from hi to goodbye.

I typically don't venture into old town in the evening, but went to Sushi Roku for a client dinner. The atmosphere was really fun, and the food was great. I actually don't eat Sushi, but everyone at my table said it was incredible. I got a filet and it was great.

So, I am a secret (or not so secret) fan of Fuddrucker's - and rarely find a burger that compares. Indulge comes very close and it has a great atmosphere. I love the burgers (natural beef), buns, fries and chocolate shake. This is a fun place to come. Also, since I am so picky, I love that you build your own burger and meal. The only negative thing I have to say is that the restaurant, although cute and trendy, is sometimes dirty. We've been sat by the bathroom, which smelled, and other times there has been a lot of mess on the floor.  Update - I have since heard that Indulge is one of the only restaurants in Scottsdale with 100% health dept rating. So - it is clean! Just went back and had a delicious burger.

Even getting to Bryan's was fun! The drive in from Scottsdale brings you through darling, western-style Cave Creek. This place has been on my bookmark list for-EVER. We sat on the patio and I had a half slab and some fries. The fries were pretty good, and the ribs were pretty amazing. The reason I only gave this four stars is that I didn't "love love" the sauce. I actually like Famous Dave's or Sweet Baby Ray's sauce better - may be just a personal preference thing. My mom got the pulled pork Sandwich and "love love"ed it. I can't wait to go back!

We tried Brio tonight for the first time and loved it. The wait was pretty long, so we ended up in the Bar and grabbed a table in the bar when one opened up. The dark wood and decor are nice - we liked the feel. The bread was fresh, warm and delicious. I liked my pasta and butter (for those of you who know me, you know I'm super picky). My husband, who really only ever "loves" hot, spicy new mexican food, "loved" his dish - Chicken Milanese Pomodoro - I never hear him talk that way about Italian food. The rest of our party was enthusiastic about the food and atmosphere as well. We'll be back!

When West Elm came to the Scottsdale Quarter, it was my first experience with the store. I've been back quite a few times since. I am not a huge fan of the modern look, but they have some great pieces that I worked into my home. In particular, they have great rugs (although limited sizes). I also love the accessories. I have some hurricanes, vase fillers, vases, etc that are great. I love west elm for unique pieces. I will note that I have not bought any furniture - not my style.   Some have noted that Crate and Barrel is less expensive, and I would say it may be somewhat - although they are pretty similar. What I like about West Elm is that it is less common, therefore the pieces are more unique.   One thing that I read in another review that I experienced as well were items on the sales floor that they did not actually sell. In particular, I loved this dome over the candles, but they said they don't sell them. I don't think it makes much sense to have home decor items in a home decor store that are not for sale.   All and all, I like it!

I am a 24 hour fitness member and this is the location closest to my house - it is a bit smaller than the larger locations(duh), but is newer so is "prettier". I am a huge, huge fan of the group exercise classes, especially 24SET (Laura is the best!). They are amazing workouts, actually they are the only real way I've ever been able to work out regularly. Also, the monthly fees are very reasonable. The staff members at this location are SUPER friendly (more so than the Scottsdale road location) and I feel very comfortable coming here.    I think this gym could work on a couple things:  - This may just be the clean freak in me, but the group x classes could use more regular cleanings. Particularly the mats.  - More classes! I had to expand my membership to another location further away because this location doesn't offer the volume and variety of classes. I understand it is a smaller location, but I would be over the moon if they added some more weekend and weeknight classes (24 SET wink wink).

I love the concept of this pet market and enjoyed my visit. They specialize in natural, organic and holistic foods and toys. This is important to me as I want my pup to be playing with toys that are made from safe materials, and eating treats, etc that contain healthy ingredients. I don't buy my dog food here, but this is one of the only places I know of that carries Zuke's natural treats. Also, I found the toy selection to be much better than pet smart's - and am happy to know Milly's toys are safe. Great store for treats, chews and toys.

I love the McDowell Mountains! A wonderful place to hike. My two favorite places to start are:   - Gateway (near DC Ranch): This is relatively new and is a great place to start a hike - amazing views, friendly people, a welcome center and a large selection of trails (and lots of help choosing the right trails). If you have not been here, you MUST try it. This is the best place to start hiking.  - Sunrise: On Via Linda, the half or the whole hike up to Sunrise is a perfect challenge.   McDowell Mountain has the perfect variety of trails and amazing views!

Over Easy gets a 3 for the food and a 4 for the overall experience. This place is just a couple blocks from my house so we walked there on Saturday morning. The interior is pretty cute and I love the setup. We didn't even have to wait for a table. I got the standard Pancakes, Bacon, Eggs and OJ. The OJ and Bacon were good, but the eggs were a little off and the pancakes were pretty bad actually. Very dry and the syrup was not all that great. I definitely liked being here though, so next time I'll try the french toast. My husband had the waffle dogs (breakfast sausage wrapped in a waffle) and he LOVED them. We'll definitely be back and hopefully the french toast will be better than the pancakes.

This is our "secret place" - we call it that because the theater is tucked away and usually not crowded. It is a relief in a world of massive parking lots, driving around for 30 minutes to find a spot, to be able to come here and not be bombarded with people.   The theater is clean, but is definitely dated and my husband and I joke that it has a slight smell.   I hope they don't ever go out of business - we love our secret theater!  UPDATE: The sad day has come. This theater is now closed.

I was able to try 5th and Wine for the first time during a friend's Bachelorette dinner. The setup for her special event was great, the staff was very friendly. I had a simple dish with pasta and chicken - it was delicious! I am going to bring my husband back soon to 5th and Wine.

I've been really disappointed with the Shell stations in Scottsdale. This is the location near my home and I would say 60% of the time, the majority of the pumps are out of order - sometimes with bags over them, sometimes they just give you an error. A different shell a couple miles away has the same issues and its automatic car wash did not work.

I went to Parc Central for lunch this weekend at the Quarter. I loved the look and feel, especially the wood used throughout. Our waiter was very nice. Since I am so picky, I just ordered some chicken tenders and shoestring potatoes. The chicken was great and the shoestring potatoes were ok. I was hoping for them to have a little more to them, like fries, but they were more like chips - which I didn't really love. Looking forward to going back and trying something else.

I've finally found my car wash home. In the 10 years I've lived in Arizona, I've complained about the car washes - they won't stop hounding you with up-sells, it takes forever, they are a zoo, they are expensive, etc.   Road Runner Express is ahhh-mazing! I drove right up, paid a couple dollars on an easy to use machine that talks to you very nicely. I pulled forward and a man directed me to be sure my tire was in the right place. He gave me a little wet cloth to wipe the dash and an air freshener. The automatic wash took me through the process and then towards the end, as I was in the drying stage, off to my right was a sign to text roadrunner to get signed up for coupons. So, I texted for coupons while being dried (genius). Afterwards I turned the corner into an abundance of free vacuum cleaners.   I'll definitely be using my buy 4 get the 5th free card and may even sign up for monthly unlimited washes for $14.   woo hoo!

After many months of loud construction, Mellow Mushroom moved in below our office. I was super excited to try it (takeout downstairs ftw) and I wasn't disappointed. The cheese pizza was not my *all time* favorite, but it was super good. The crust was delicious and there wasn't too much sauce. What was actually my favorite was the cheese bread - mmm!

After my initial review, Jay, the owner, reached out and suggested I try the larger pizza which is a bit different than the lunch pizza. A couple of us went in today for lunch, and not only did Sean, the manager, take care of our whole meal for us, the larger pizza was great. Such good crust. Thanks guys!

I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING! I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute!   Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc). Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented. I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly. Also, she has a talent for men's hair as well. She cuts my husband's hair and that is one of his best qualities (I'd say!). There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men!  Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry. I never loved my color until I found Veronica. Now, I trust her completely and know she'll make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me. She's also super sweet! I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist.

I love slickables! The employees are super nice - and they serve you really fast.   The ice cream is your classic, delish ice cream and the cookies are soooo good.   Oy vey I work near here and go here way too much. Such a classically GOOD little place. Prices are great as well.

Did I mention how crazy delish the cookies are?  The beauty of this place is that it is classically good. Not trying to be too fancy, spend too much on decor, just solid, good ice cream and cookies.   We just took 2 dozen cookies to an agency partner for the holidays and they said they were the best cookies they had ever had!

I took a group of about 15 clients to North in October. The doors were open and the weather was great. The decor was super cool. Although the staff had put my reservation on the wrong day, it was a Tuesday at 6 so we were able to get a table. The server was really nice, and I have to say the food was DELICIOUS. I think almost everyone at the table really loved the apps, entree, and dessert. I'll be heading back when I feel like Italian food. :)

What a great place! I've heard about it so much, and finally got to give it a try. The owner and manager so generously hosted Desert Harbor Doberman Rescue for a happy hour - and they donated 15% during that time period to the rescue - what wonderful people! Our waitstaff was so friendly and helpful - the place was crazy packed, obviously this is the place to be. They are incredibly dog friendly and a lot of people came there on bikes. A lot of people in our group really liked the food they ordered. Really, really good fries. I ordered off the kids menu and didn't love the chicken fingers (kind of a processed taste), but I think that is what I get for ordering off the kids menu - that is probably what kids like. :) So happy that I got to try out OHSO.

I tried Grassroots last weekend - convenient location, friendly little spot, and great decor. Loved the ice-cold water, with no ice. I have this thing about worrying ice is always dirty. Anyhow, the ribs and shoestring fries were super good. I had a taste of the roasted chicken and it was also pretty good. Very moist and tender. I definitely want to go back and try more. A little on the higher end of price range, but nothing at all unreasonable for the quality of food. I always love when things are locally sourced as well, makes the eating feel so much cleaner.

I've been seeing Dr. McMahon, now Fontius, for quite a few years. She's always been kind, remembers me, and is friendly. She takes great care of my health. The two reasons I really love going here:  1. You never have to sit in the waiting room too long. I think it is totally unacceptable when DRs offices make you sit there for 30-40 minutes. That never happens here.  2. The receptionist is SO NICE. 90% of all healthcare receptionists are horrible with major attitude and this woman is very nice.

Went to Virtu with a friend for brunch. Amazing crepe and side of fruit. I hope to go back soon! It was also a super cute little place. Wonderful service - very kind employees.

I have to start out with a confession: I have a little girl crush on Breanna. She is so graceful, beautiful, and kind and her skin is so perfect! Ok now that we have that out of the way...  I was referred to Healthy Skin AZ by my dear friend a couple months ago. I had my eyebrows waxed like 10 years ago, and it was a disaster - nothing dramatic, they just did not look good. I have this weird thing. I think that eyebrows can really make or break a girl - I totally am ashamed to say I judge other girls on their eyebrows. I decided I wanted to start getting my eyebrows waxed for a better shape than I could create, but I was so scared. So much could go wrong.   From our first meeting (Breanna was able to squeeze me into her crazy schedule), Breanna put me at ease and made me feel that this just wasn't a quick wax. I mean for goodness' sake we created an eyebrow plan together, which would unfold over a couple months and resulted in eyebrows that are better shaped - natural yet tailored and clean with an arch.   I don't  have much experience, but based on my results, her reputation, and her insane schedule, I'd wager that she is the best in Arizona!

Pomo is back, closer to my house and better than ever. I am sooo happy they are finally open. This is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten. Ohhhhh so good. The new place is ultra cute as well, with an added market. I am happy I don't have to drive all the way to Central Phx for this type of deliciousness. I may have had Pomo two nights in a row. oops.

I tried eggstacy this weekend and it was great. The menu was huge, which is great for picky eaters. There are a ton of things I could have tried. I went with the waffles, eggs and bacon. Great all around. I loved that the fresh fruit was in big chunks and nothing gross or wimpy like those generic little fruit bowls with Honeydew.    The look & feel is great. The only exception is the group of tables next to the large kitchen opening, I wouldn't want to sit there, or at the tables that are essentially right in the doorway.

As you may be able to tell from my other reviews, Indulge closing sent me into a deep, that-was-my-favorite-place-ever depression. I just wanted to know WHY and was left without any answers, like my boyfriend had just broken up with me and not given me any closure. I had never had a burger so delicious. Every place I go is measured against Indulge, and no one ever stacks up. When I saw this place opening, the font felt familiar and my conspiracy theories kicked in. Maybe my beloved Indulge was opening up under a new name. I have since been assured that is not at all the case (more tears). We finally got over there to try Burgers N Fries tonight.  I love the doors (saw that someone didn't like those) and the open feeling. The menu on the mirror is a bit hard to read, but I know what I want so no biggie. We ordered and everyone was very nice. The food came really fast and the girls came by our table a bunch and were SUPER nice. Now....to the big moment...the burger was GREAT. I hate overly complicated burgers or burgers that taste like they were cooked at home. This was neither - it was just good, basic and delish. If I were to say Indulge burgers were 9.5, this burger was an 8.75 or 9. The closest I have been able to find since Indulge closed. I will say maybe the cheese slices could be a bit thicker, maybe a tiny bit more cheese. Anyhow, I actually LOVED that it wasn't this massive thick burger. I can't eat all that anyhow (and really, shouldn't we all stick to smaller portions my fellow Americans?). The men can get the double if they need it.   The fries were good and the shake was great (maybe a tiny bit too thick which sometimes can make it not as cold as I'd like). I love custard, mmm!   Our meal for two people came to about $30, which did kind of feel over-priced. But, knowing this is the closest I have been able to get to my fave burger, I am willing to pay it!   One thing I will add specific to other reviews about natural beef. It is a HUGE deal, and I will ONLY eat at places with natural/grass fed beef. If you don't care, you should.   I hope they make it, don't be the second to break my heart (stomach)!   PS I am still wondering why my boyfriend Indulge broke up with me. WTF happened to them? I thought things were going so great with us. ;)

Culinary Dropout in Tempe is beautiful - a really nice space. Busy even on a Wednesday evening. The staff was incredibly friendly.   The fried chicken was probably the best or next to the best I've ever had, all time. It was amazing. Everyone else I was with loved their food. I also thought the grilled cheese sliders were great. They didn't try to over-fancify them. Just good, traditional grilled cheese.   It is a bit overpriced for what it is, but oh well. The menu didn't note that it was grass-fed or organic or anything, so I am not sure what kind of chicken it is to be so pricey.   It is a great atmosphere and delicious. I will definitely go back. Maybe next time 5 stars. I think they are still getting ramped up - I asked for a box and they threw away my food. They did make a completely full new meal for me and the waiter was super nice about it. The valet also took a pretty long time.
