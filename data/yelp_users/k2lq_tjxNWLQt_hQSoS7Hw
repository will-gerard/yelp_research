As a former drummer in a band, this was my favorite place to play.  As a spectator, I am just as smitten.  This place is run by old school professionals who treat musicians well.  They are up front about what they want from you but they are also accommodating.    The vibe is that of a classy dive bar.  If that makes any sense.  Anyway, the sound is great and the beer selection is decent.  I also respect that while you can see some great indie rock there, they are still dedicated to blues and jazz on the weekends.  It would contend for my favorite place ever if that rib shack in the parking lot ever seemed open on the occasions I've gone to shows.

Good drinks and good food. Laid back and easier to find a seat than Lux. Try the Curry Chicken Salad sandwich. That's my favorite meal. Super tasty. The breakfast bagel is solid too. As for drinks, I like mine iced and their white mocha and their tuxedo are my favorite coffee drinks so far. Sometimes they have live music. I was there today, Sunday early afternoon, and they had a good jazz unit playing. They also have loyalty punch cards.

I've been to a few boutique hotels, and this seems like one of the better ones.  They often have good deals like buy two nights get one free.  The pool is nice on a hot day especially because you can get drinks from the utterly fantastic restaurant in the hotel, Gallo Blanco.  There is even a rooftop where parties are often held.  I've had some fun up there.  I wish I lived closer so I could bike ride over on a summer day.

I've only eaten there once.  We shared a bunch of food but the highlight is easily the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  Dunk that sandwich and slip into bliss.  My only complaint is that it is often too busy to get a decent seat.  We've been shut out on a lot of First Fridays which is to be expected.  However, it wasn't always First Friday.

An historic home downtown turned into a bar?  I really love this place.  The selection of bottled beers is pretty great.  I'm also a big fan of the dimly lit atmosphere.  Free music at night and a location between a late night coffee house and nacho shop.  Vertical integration?

They serve Only 8 brand frozen yogurt here.  For all you concerned about weight loss out there, this is a good thing.  Not only do they have some great and unique flavors, they all taste good even though they're pretty light on the calories.    I've been to this location twice and the place has been clean and the employees are friendly enough.

Tried to return a pair of jeans there today that werent me. Told me I could not return them without a punchcard they had given me. I think they were just trying to avoid a return. I don't live near this place so it was a hassle to drive out of my way. The stuff about the punchcard was not in their online return policy nor on the receipt that it been printed out at the store I bought them from. Pretty poor customer service from a place that I thought was pretty good.i'm not sure why they're worried about a punchcard that isn't even worth $10 yet because it's not all the way punched when all this does is assure that I'll never return to that store.

My favorite fish tacos. I love mango, but not normally in salsa form or with other foods. But their mango slaw is perfect for the fish. These tacos are awesome. If I had one complaint, it's that you can't really eat them by hand and it's too hard to cut the tortilla up into bites on the plate. But I'd still be excited to go here always.

Melissa at matriarch is amazing! I've been photographing her hair work for years now. Bridal, fashion, whatever. Always amazing and always getting better and better... If that's possible. I recently worked with her on a bridal shoot and I was blown away with her creation. Also, she is one of the nicest people ever. Always passionate about what she does and making people look amazing.
