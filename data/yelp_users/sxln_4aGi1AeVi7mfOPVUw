Negative stars.  I got the Cox Contour set up and it has been AWFUL.  I have to constantly reset the cable box even after I had a tech come out. You would think with all the bad reviews, that COX would have a representative reach out to people writing the reviews to see how they can improve their experience.  The worst customer service EVER, they need to talk with other companies who provide the best customer service such as: Zappos, Amazon, etc. Those are huge companies and they figure out how to do it the right way. If I could switch to Direct TV, I would, but my complex doesn't allow satellite dishes on our balcony.

Awful cable and internet service. Internet would go out once a week and then they wanted to charge me for a technician to come out. I switched to century link internet and it has been amazing. I kept cox cable and got the contour upgrade. Half the time I have to unplug then replug in the cable box and it still doesn't work. Cable companies are a monopoly and I would switch to dish or direct tv if my complex allowed me to have a satellite dish on my balcony , wish I could give cox negative stars. Hopefully they get bought out or they go out of business.

This place rocks... it's a Chicago bar, and they also have the cornhole game...I'm kind of a legend when it comes to that game, I won the Best Damn Bags League tourney there a while back.  Great food, good drinks and nice staff.  It also has a huge outdoor patio which is awesome when the weather is nice.

Is this heaven?.....No, it's Scottsdale BBQ Co.  $1 PBR's, yes please.  Fantastic decor, yes I will.  This place makes me want to grow a moustache.  My roomate and I had a pulled pork sandwich and 4 beers each for $24.  If you don't like this place, you aren't my friend.  You can find me there every Sunday watching Nascar with Scott.  All in all, this place defines what it is to be an American.

Way too expensive for a turkey sandwich I can make at home. It was around $7.75 for the sandwich and a bag of plain potato chips. Small smoothie was $4.75. Over priced.

Went in to upgrade to the IPhone 6 and they were out of stock.  They said they had no idea when they would be getting a shipment in.  Wouldn't you want to be able to give customers info on when they could come back to purchase (ie give them business)?  So basically I have to call every Verizon store every day to see if they received a shipment, since they don't know when they will receive them?

I mapped out this JJ location to my house and it is 2.8 miles (6 minute drive), but I called and apparently I'm out of their delivery zone. HUH? 2.8 miles and you don't deliver to me?  No wonder you can be freaky fast, you only deliver to places that are 2 blocks away.  Good business model, don't deliver to people in your same area.
