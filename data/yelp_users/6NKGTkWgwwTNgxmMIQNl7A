I meet clients for lunch.  I don't live in most of the places I do this in, and because I have an expense account, I usually don't care too much about the price for lunch.  I'm there to talk up my product, so the food, ambience, wait staff etc, should be good, and yet invisible.  I depend on Yelpers to keep me in the know when it comes to restaurants.  This place was as advertised.  Good food, good wine selection (although we didn't drink at lunch).    The vodka sauced dish was good and my client's steak salad was too.  We has some kind of puff pastry that was really good, though I had to nearly beg to get them to cut it in half for my client and I so two grown men in suits weren't carving it up at the table.  All in all a very nice spot waaaay off the strip.

I met with some clients here for lunch.  Yelpers had truly scared me about the consistency of their delivery.  Let me say, in my case, the service was excellent.  We had an older gentleman as a server, with a thick german accent, who cracked jokes and kept the lunch moving along smoothly, as well as being fully fluent in the menu items.  I had the lobster bisque and if you look at the picture it was amazing, they actually bring you a little tower of lobster and then pour the hot bisque around it, served with freshly baked bread, my mouth is watering just remembering it.  Note, it was not cheap, but that's why they made expense accounts.

We had a large bachelor party booked here for months. Due to administrative error (double booking by their staff) we were told we could be seated in different areas (not as a group) or to find another venue. One star for lack of flexibility, poor customer service, and because Yelp won't let me give a zero. Sad I'll miss out trying the place as it was hyped by the organizer, but I hold a mean grudge once burned.

Seafood in AZ?  Isn't that like Chicago style pizza in Hawaii?  No. We hit this place up on the 4th of July, while all the other touristos were down getting blitzed in Tempe, and it was amazing. They had great specials, good oysters rockefeller, good steaks, and we all left totally stuffed.   If you are looking for a decent seafood spot (that isn't sushi) give this joint a whirl.

Out of chips...so no nachos, chips and salsa, etc. Tried for chicken quesadilla...ran out of chicken and forgot to press start to cook more. Whoever is doing the ordering needs to re-evaluate how they are doing it. That being said, we had a firecracker of a waitress in Stacie, who took her restaurant's shortcomings in stride and kept our drinks refilled. Not the best, not the worst, but not having chips in a Mexican restaurant is a major faux pas.

Hung out during happy hour with "Jules", who made us feel at home, turned us onto some new cocktails and we all had fun.  By far one of the more expensive sushi restaurants, but that might have had to do with our huge appetite and dozens of drinks.  A great spot for sushi, and beautiful all white decor.  Although I can't imagine how much the janitor's life sucks keeping it clean.

My new favorite bar in Vegas. Now, I hate most of what you think of when you think, Vegas. Gambling? I'm too good at math. Strippers? Sorry, knowing daddy didn't hug someone enough ruins it for me. What else? Club pools? Meh. But...this place. An italian steakhouse mixed with a prohibition cocktail bar. EFF YES. Red velvet walls, dark wood, two happy hours (save HALF OFF MEAT) and some really good dishes. I had the prime, my coworker had the rack of lamb, jalapeno creamed corn, etc. Bomb. The whole place is what I want from Vegas. Top notch.

First off, if you go here for the food, you've blown it. Not to say the food isn't good, it is, but if you're going to hooters for the wings, you've already failed. We stayed a block or two away from this shisha bar with a kitchen tucked in behind the W and near Mint, and wound up smoking/eating/drinking there several times over the course of the week. It became our last call spot, golfcarting there after a night at Gilligans or Bungalow. Sit outside, smoke some shisha, watch the Persians smoke and play cards and snap quips at each other in farsi...it's an experience. The food was good enough that we even got it to go and munch late, late night, back at the ranch. Dogfish 90 minute in bottles was all I remember, but that's a barometer for a decent beer selection if I've ever seen one. Definitely a cool spot.

Best nachos I've ever had. Hands down. If you are fortunate enough to be in this terminal of PHX...do it.

Relatively inexpensive, really good feng shui, beautiful rooms, decent pool...north end of town, about two miles from Fremont Street, two miles from the main strip...cheap lyft/uber to either. Coffee shop, gym, spa, bars, etc, restaurants, all on site. My only issue was the $30 resort fee these guys add on after you think you're all paid up via hotels.com. Classic tack on after thinking I had paid my bill prior to getting there. Easy to miss that on an expense account. SPG hotel, make sure you have your number handy.

Was looking for a place near the W Scottsdale to get coffee, closest place was this or coffee Bean and tea leaf. I elected to try this out. Staff was friendly. Croissants were fresh and hot. Coffee excellent, five stars. Actually, the staff was so friendly it blew my mind. I normally don't Yelp from the parking lot but had to in this case.
