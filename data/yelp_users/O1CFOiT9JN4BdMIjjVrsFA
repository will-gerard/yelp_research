Disliked it. I went in for two appointments to give them a try. The office is nice, and the staff is very professional and courteous. Really, the staff was my favorite part of the whole experience.  The wait times are longer than I am used to. Most chiropractors in my experience don't make you wait more than 3-5 minutes, here I waited about 10 minutes for both of my visits.  I did not feel like I received the attention I needed. I know my body very well, and I know where my issues are. A good indicator for me is how well chiropractors can find them and mention them to me in my first one or two visits. Other chiropractors in the area did a much better job in finding my "bad" spots. My neck adjustments were initiated from the head. What I mean by that is they "whip", or rapidly turn, the head to adjust your neck. I prefer it when adjustments are more controlled.  Yes, everyone is very friendly. However, it does have a rather strong "business" vibe. Not that there is anything wrong with running a nice office or being successful. However, to me, it felt like I did not get enough attention or that I really mattered as a patient. Also, they offered me a 2 month care plan for X dollars and X dollars off if I signed up today. That I did not like at all. Again, nothing wrong with offering care packages, I do believe chiropractic care is a part of a healthy life, but I did not like how it was done.

Dental visits make me nervous usually but Dr. Tran and her team are spectacular, hands down the best dental office I've ever been to. I just came out of a 4 hour appointment involving two fillings and a crown replacement and I don't see how it could have been any easier. The shots didn't hurt, drilling didn't hurt, the staff was friendly and made jokes making me feel comfortable the whole time. Dr. Tran was really good about keeping me up-to-date on the process, what's going on and what's coming next, and answering any questions. I'm so happy I found this place. I can't say I'm excited to go to the dentist, but I'm extremely grateful to get it over and done with so pleasantly.

Matt is an excellent communicator and very uncomplicated. I appreciate that he texted me the morning of the service and let me know the estimated time he would be at my house. He arrived right on time. Matt is very knowledgable about his profession and enjoys what he does, which makes being around him fun.  My dryer vent was cleaned well, and I will be using him again for my next annual cleaning. Highly recommended.

Dr. Khayami is a great Doctor of chiropratic and knows his stuff. He has a traction table that he uses during adjustments, which is rare, and awesome. Adjustments are done in a controlled and precise manner, and feel very safe. Dr. Khayami is passionate about what he does and takes time to educate you. He discusses where you are now, what you want for yourself, and how he can assist you in getting there. Treatments are effective and feel very personalized and genuine.  He has helped me reduce the scoliosis in my thoracic spine and reduced the "finickiness" of my lumbar spine. Whenever I hurt myself or feel like my body is out of alignment I call Dr. Khayami and he can usually see me within 24 hours and puts me back into place!  The office atmosphere is casual and fun. Dr. Khayami is very respectful of his client's time. In the 30 or more visits I've had, my average wait time has been maybe 2 minutes. There may have been 1 time I had to wait for 10 minutes.  Highly recommended.

I've used this company twice to come and collect debris from construction projects in my back yard. Both times they came out the same day and did a great job. When I call them I immediately get a person on the phone, and everyone I have interacted with was very friendly and uncomplicated. Highly recommended.

I am very happy with my experience with Canterbury Law Group. Craig Cherney and his paralegal Leslie Menegay aided me through a divorce process in 2014. They were quick to respond to concerns, gave me support, and were reliable in keeping me informed. I never felt pressured; they always had my best interest at heart.  Overall it was a simple case and instead of raking up the costs it was decided the best course of action was for Canterbury Law Group to withdraw from the case and allow me to represent myself. This way I could save money on hearings and the trial (which is were things get really expensive). Everything went as planned and I was able to fully succeed in court, but only because of the great prep work I did with Craig & Leslie.  I highly recommend him and his team to anyone in need of a knowledgable and honest family law expert.

I'm really surprised to see so many negative reviews for this dealership. All I know is my own experience with them, which has been GREAT.  I bought my car there April 2013. My sales person (Chris Johnson) was very responsive to my emails and didn't seem "pushy" at all. I had already done all my research and knew exactly what I wanted. When I came in to sign the paperwork I didn't have to wait more than a few minutes before we got started. The whole process was fast and easy. One thing I didn't like was the guy I had to see after my salesperson, to talk about extended warranty, scratch protection, etc. He was a bit pushy and rude, didn't like him very much. Overall, I would say 4/5 stars for the buying experience.  BUT, I have to give them 5 stars overall because of how awesome their service department is. I have owned expensive cars, including Mercedes and BMW and this is hands down the best service department I've ever been to. Ever. My service guy (Nick) is always upbeat and friendly, I never have to wait even 1 second to go see him when I come in for service. He always meets or beats his time estimates. One time when I was getting my 30k mile service he was in jeopardy of running over his time estimate while I was waiting on my car, and although the service was done it was still in queue to be washed, so he ran out and washed it himself!  In life in general, I don't particularly like car dealerships, but as far as dealerships go CardinaleWay Mazda deserves 5 stars, especially for their service department which is outstanding.
