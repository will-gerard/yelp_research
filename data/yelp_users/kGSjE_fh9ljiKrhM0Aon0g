No-frills place, with good fish and chips (and oysters, and shrimp, and crab legs)... It's definitely a dive, with prices to match, but the portions are generous and the breading on the fish -- the most important part! -- is crisp and perfect. Skip the chain restaurants when you have a yen for fried seafood and check out this Phoenix local instead.

So much fun! A surprisingly healthy meal with fresh veggies and meats, delectable sauces, and a great romantic experience. It seems intimidating at first to be cooking your own meats etc at the table but the service was superb and they explained everything. We came in with high expectations and they were definitely met!

Come for the barbeque, stay for all the rest -- this is an old-fashioned joint, cafeteria-style lineup but with a LOT more charm.   The BBQ is the star of the show here -- I had the sliced beef brisket and the pulled pork, both of which were superb. The ribs looked great as well. My side of coleslaw had a touch of fennel to it, and while I don't normally like fennel it wasn't overwhelming and I found myself eating it all.  Now, theoretically you could eat healthy/paleo here -- stick to the meats and veggies and iced tea -- but why would you, when there's fresh hot cornbread with honey butter? And root beer cake? And a bourbon-blueberry cheesecake? And the rare-but-delicious Barq's red cream soda on fountain? We fell victim to all of the above, and I don't regret it one bit. I'll be recommending Joe's for sure.

There's much to love about Joe's. Quality is consistent, service is efficient, and the food is good, simple, and fresh. This is not the cheapest place to have lunch, but it's the best, and I'm all about their farm-in-the-city philosophy.  Here are my highlights:  1. The pesto chicken sandwich. I order it without the bun, so it comes heaped with crisp dark lettuce, tomato, fresh sauteed mushrooms, and enough (house-made!) pesto to cover every bite.  2. The sweet potato fries with spicy-sweet pineapple dipping sauce. Never have healthy sweet potatoes tasted almost unhealthily delicious.  3. The onion rings. Thick cut with rosemary herb panko makes them unique.  As a side note, the HUGE tree next to the outdoor seating area is spectacular.

San Tan Flat is incredibly fun, social, and a very unique venue. It has the old-fashioned feel of a cowboy camp, with dozens of individual bonfires outside, lots of picnic table seating, and the surrounding buildings (restaurant, pool hall, etc.) in Old West style.   My handsome dance partner and I definitely enjoyed the live music and the circular dance floor -- there's nothing quite like country dancing under the stars!   There's some DIY -- bring your own marshmallows to roast, collect wood to feed your  fire, pick up your own food + drinks inside -- but as an independent spirit I didn't mind one bit. Also be aware of the weather, and avoid breezy nights if you're smoke-sensitive.  However, the very BEST thing about San Tan, in my opinion, are the awesome quotes by the Founding Fathers painted all over the place. Any music stage that features the quote by Thomas Jefferson "When the people fear the government there is tyranny, when the government fears the people there is liberty" is A-OK in my book... and even Ron Paul made a point to eat here on a visit to Arizona, so it's gotta be cool!

Susan was awesome! She is truly an expert tailor and made my wedding dress (which had some major fitting issues with the lace shoulders/illusion neckline) fit like a glove. She also did a very attractive bustle and took in the waistline. Not only did it look beautiful when Susan was done with it, but her prices were very reasonable and the turnaround time was much faster than I expected, just one week.  I would recommend Susan to anyone looking for wedding dress alterations, skip the bridal shops and go to her instead!

Go for the happy hour -- $5 glasses of good wine on a lovely patio are always the best way to spend an afternoon! The wine selection here is always excellent, especially the whites -- I'm normally a red wine drinker but at Postino I feel confident branching out to the pale side.  As for food, I've never tried a bruschetta here I didn't like, it lives up to its reputation. I also recommend the brunch on weekends: the menu is somewhat small but the choices are delicious -- I've had the farm scramble and also the walnut bread with brie and jam is to-die-for.  This being an Italian sort of menu, there isn't much in the way of gluten-free options, but if all you can have is wine, there's nothing wrong with that!

We tried Ryu as a spur-of-the-moment decision on New Year's Eve, and it did not disappoint. The sushi was fresh, delicious, and high-quality -- we ordered classics like the dragon roll, spicy tuna + shrimp tempura, and nigiri (salmon and unagi). The fish was cut generously with good proportions and value for the price.   Despite it being packed on a holiday night, the service was good and friendly, and our order came out in decent time. The atmosphere and decor is warm and modern, not cold the way some sushi/Japanese places are.  I look forward to trying more of their rolls (the Lovers roll and Surf & Turf both look tempting) and checking out the happy hour, which we were told is 5-7pm, Mon-Thurs.   Keep it up, Ryu Sushi!

HORRIBLE customer service and a sub-par gym.  We just decided to cancel membership at this gym, which has changed owners yet again and is now Fitness Works. My fiance had been a member here since it was Spectrum, and signed up for the $20/month plan because it allowed him to bring a guest (me).   It went downhill when Fitness Evolution took over (cardio machines broken, run-down weight machines, not the cleanest facility, drinking fountains taste like they're piped in from the warm swimming pool).  However, it was the new Fitness Works' total lack of regard for customer service that made us cancel. They changed the policy so that $20/month no longer includes a guest (but hey, you get access to classes you'll never use!) and they wouldn't let us switch to two of the $10/month memberships unless we paid a $39 new member fee, a $39 downgrade fee for my fiance, and ANOTHER $39 "annual" fee!   The location is so convenient for us and all Fitness Works would have needed to do was juggle the membership status so that we were paying the same price that we'd always paid, for the original terms of the contract. But they wouldn't budge, and were so rude about it, and kept adding new charges on -- at first they were going to "waive" the downgrade fee, then 10 minutes later they weren't, then it was yet another $39 for who-knows-what.  Terrible, terrible customer relations -- instead of keeping members at a consistent rate, Fitness Works just lost two. And as we've been shopping around for a new gym, we've heard from multiple places that we're far from the only ones to abandon this sinking ship.

This kitchen needs to get its act together. I recently stopped in here to see local band Pride Through Strife (who are awesome) play on the patio. I ordered the bacon bleu cheese burger. When it arrived, it was missing half the toppings listed on the menu -- no arugula, no roma tomatoes, and most importantly NO BACON (travesty!).   I pointed out that the bacon bleu was missing its most important half, along with the rest of the advertised ingredients, and the server sent it back to the kitchen for fixing yet again.   When it came back, our poor burger had a limp, undercooked slice of bacon on it. Still no lettuce or tomato.   Exasperated and hungry, I ate it anyway, and I was afraid if I sent it back it might be unrecognizable when it returned. Seriously, Stadium needs to step up its game if it wants to do well in this high competition location. Customers don't like being denied their bacon.  As for the rest... One star is for ambiance, good band, and the spacious bar and patio setup -- including bar games like ping pong, man jenga, beer pong, cornhole, etc. It's still not as cool as The Yard but points for activities.  One star is for our server/bartender. She was friendly and very apologetic about the issues with the food.
