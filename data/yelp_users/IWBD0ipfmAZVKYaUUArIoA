Located in Caesar's Forum, Sushi Roku's seating view of the Vegas strip is amazing. The decor was romantic and modern. We ordered the 4 course prix for two and the entire meal was about an hour, it was long but it was satisfying. The service was excellent, you almost have to sit still and any movement they will come to ask how you are doing.   Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely come back for more Sushi Roku.

I had asked local people in Vegas on where they would go for buffet, they said Luxor's More Buffet, from that we opted for the lunch and dinner buffet and what a surprise that both sessions had the same entrees with an addition of cocktail shrimp for the dinner session.   The food itself was mediocre and tasteless. The service was great and  they removed the dirty plates and filled our drinks fast. Luxor needs to do a cosmetic upgrade, the dining area looks dingy and dated.   I guess I should have known that local people have less standards in food than tourists. Next time I will ask the tourists what buffets they like. Lesson learned.

Not exactly what I expected from a Wendy's in the airport, I ordered a double burger combo and was perfect as expected for a quick snack but what I did not expect was the condiments that I needed to make this a great meal. They did not have napkins, ketchup, mustard, pepper and salt packets. They did have a straw for the drink.

Tried this place on a recommendation. From the parking lot this place did not look like a Japanese restaurant but a bar. I sat  down and the menu had many selections ranging from udon noodles to specialty rolls. I saw and ordered one of my favorite appetizers (hamachi kama) and the sashimi special which is the 12 piece chef's selection.   The food came fairly fast especially the hamachi kama (the colar of a yellowtail fish), which usually comes after the dinner if prepared correctly. First glance, it looked very good but once I stuck my fork into it it was a bit overcooked, the meat was not flaky but a bit spongy and there were a few scales on the skin - Terrible!  Next came the sashimi and it looked good and was decent, thin slices of meat, the tuna was on the light side but decent.   Overall I would not come back again.
