I was trying to be healthy and  ordered a vegetable bowl with brown rice. It was very bland. I could have just coooked some brown rice and microwaved some plain veggies and saved the $6.00.   As for service, I was in the middle of the line to order and mine was the last to come out. It was just me and my order was simple, compared to the meat dishes ordered ny the other customers. Which looked way better than what I ordered.  I probably won't go back since it not near my house, I really just tried it because it was on my way.

I go to this place often to shop and have never had an issue. It's hit or miss as far as finding something I want to buy. This week though, they have a great selection of accessories and great prices. I walked out very happy

I tried Wong's for the first time and I can say I definitely say I will not go back.  We ordered our food for take out and I ordered the almond chicken dinner special.The meal also came with wonton soup, fried wonton, eggroll, and we ordered a side of crab puffs.  The almond chicken was disappointing there wasn't much chicken in there, the zucchini and mushrooms were plentiful in the meal. I was a little confused by the addition of peas in the medley. I expected there to be slivered almonds mixed in with the dish. However I received cut up almonds that looked like the kind you buy for baking just dumped on the top of the dish.    The fried wonton and eggroll were ok. What you would typically expect to get from  a Chinese restaurant. The wonton tasted overcooked, I had to dip it in the soup to make it edible. The Crab puff had barely any filling in the puff it was almost completely flat, very disappointing.  The one saving grace was the wonton soup. The soup is the only thing I would ever eat from that place again and I don't plan on going back.

I visited my cousin at the resort when they stayed in town. They have a fun water slide in the pool and a few hidden small pool's through out the resort. The views were beautiful and the service at the hotel was good. You do need wristband for the pool which is kind of annoying.   The only bad thing about the resort is that to walk to some of the pools you need to walk through the parking area, which does not have any sidewalks and there isn't any other direction to get there. Not so great when you are walking with kids. There were people driving pretty fast in that parking lot too.

I use MAC a lot because I just love their products. This store is a little small as the other reviews state but they had everything I needed. The girl who helped me was great and looked up all my products from another store and I was out in less then 10 minutes  on a busy Saturday night.  Great experience, I will definitely go back for to that location for my products.

Over all the food was good. I had a room temperature rice dish with beef and a crispy roll. I am not normally a fan of fish sauce but theirs was good. I did not add the whole dish, I feel like it would have been too much. I did however add some sauce for additional flavor.  I also loved their iced coffee!

I forgot my lunch and this place happened to be down the street from my office.   First the food: It was overpriced but it tasted fine. I got the greek salad with falafel.   Nothing special but not bad. I would have normally given it two or three stars.  Service: I would give zero stars. I was paying for my salad and he pointed to the take out waiting  area. I then went to grab a takeout menu to keep at my desk for future reference and said, "you wait there", in a very rude tone. I just told him I heard him the first time I am grabbing a menu. I will not be back, to a place that talks to their customers that way.  I also saw something that I am sure is a code violation. The male  cashier went right from the register and helped the kithchen by slicing meat. I'm pretty sure you have to wash your hands in between register and working with food, money amd cards are so dirty. I know that was the rule when I worked a short stint in food service.

I just came in for takeout again. This is one of my new favorite Thai resturants. They always give you good portions, I get almost three meals out of one dinner and the food is always good and flavorful and their take out is fast. I will keep coming back!

I ordered take out from here again. It was good as usual, however I should have listened to the other reviews and not ordered the fried tofu, it was too soggy.

I have found some great deals here, Including a bike in good condition for $35.00. Also some decent office furniture. Last two times I went to get office furniture all the decent looking stuff had a $5.00 price tag and was "sold" to someone named Samantha. Interesting how this same person keeps getting there to get all the nice stuff first.  However, I drove out there today to get something for my office and they were closed when they were supposed to be open. So stuff wise, you can find great stuff if Samantha doesn't buy it all first, service wise good if they are open when they say they will be.

It feels wierd to write review for a fast place but when you get good service it should be acknowledged.   I come here occasionally for dinner when I work late and don't feel lile cooking. The food is good, for fast food. It s always fast amd hot with friendly service. I came here for breakfast for the first time this morning. I enjoyed the breakfast, I got the chicken biscut and hashbrowns. The biscut was flavorful better than any other fast food place.  Why am I giving a fast food resturant 5 stars? Well the polite friendly service makes it go from 4 to a 5. They always say my pleasure. They also will give you extra condiments with out charging extra like most other fast food resturants. I will always come here if I am craving fast food.

I loved the beer selection of course! I had a Hava Blue beer from Mudshark that was delicious. They even floated blueberries in the beer. The second beer I tried I was not too fond of, which is probably why I do not remember the name.   The waitress we had was not the friendliest, so over all the service was ok. She was not very knowledgeable about the beers either.   Tip . The only downfall about this place is they do not serve food. You are allowed to bring in outside food. So you have to plan ahead a little if you plan on drinking there for awhile and think you might get hungry.

I went there for the first time yesterday. I had the bison dog with fries. I thought the food was really good. The one downfall, I got the homemade ketchup with the fries, It was o.k. it tasted more like thick marinara sauce than ketchup.   The service was pretty good, and I was happy with the large selection of beers they had to try. Some of the descriptions could have been a little better on the board so you had a better idea of what you were getting.
