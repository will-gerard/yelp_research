Best sushi in the valley! They have a great selection of rolls, sushi, and sashimi and the quality is unbeatable. The two sushi chefs are very friendly and knowledgable. They have happy hour every day with some great specials. We won't go anywhere else for sushi!

Cute, quirky, delicious. First time I went in it was "free shot Friday" so the barista threw an extra shot in my iced vanilla latte. Score! Second time I went in I ordered an iced chai with an add shot and she offered me up to four shots for the same price! Double score!! Never left here disappointed, best coffee shop around :)

Love the hungry monk! They have a great beer selection and  I love all their food. And I love places that do daily specials. We always sit at the bar and tiffany, martese and heather are all super nice and make sure to take care of us. There's one older guy that bar tends who is pretty rude so if we see he's working we just go somewhere else. So maybe I'd give the place four and a half stars because of him. But overall we love it.

This place was a major disappointment. We had heard a lot of good things from a lot of different people so we decided to try it out. We sat at a table in the cocktail area for about five minutes before our server came over. Instead of greeting us kindly, she flatly said "what are you having?" Umm, not a good first impression. Let's just say the service didn't get any better from there on out. Since this place is located right across from san tan brewery, you would expect a sports bar to at least have good drink prices. A 20oz bud light was like $5 or $6. And it got worse from there. We stuck with water. The food SOUNDED good. I ordered a side caesar salad and one of their specialty pizzas (the great white pie). My husband ordered their "famous" lobster bisque and a burger (the baca loca). My caesar salad had virtually no dressing, ONE crouton, zero cheese, way too much parsley, and instead of romaine lettuce it was huge pieces of green leaf that I had to cut up myself because the kitchen didn't take the time to. My husband's lobster bisque was okay.. definitely no need to call it famous. When we finally got our entrees, it was another major disappointment. My pizza was disgusting. The crust had zero flavor and was way too chewy. The whole thing tasted pretty bland. My husband ordered his burger medium rare and came out well done and was super chewy. He's a big eater and didn't even bother finishing it. Needless to say, I don't think we'll ever return to Coach and Willies.

This has to be some of the best Thai food I've ever had! I ordered the Crispy Thai Rolls, the Kang Dang Curry and the Cashew Chicken. Everything was so delicious. I ordered the curry with no spice and it still had an awesome kick to it. The shrimp and all the veggies were cooked perfectly and the pineapple added an unexpected but delicious sweetness. The Thai rolls came with a nice little side salad with a peanut sauce. When we picked up the food the lady at the counter was extremely friendly and gave us two Thai teas to go. I'll definitely be going back!!
