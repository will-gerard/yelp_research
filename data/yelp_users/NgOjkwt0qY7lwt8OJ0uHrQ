I ordered the spinach rice and beans which was excellent. Service was slow to start I waited 10 minutes for a cup of tea. Lunch is a very busy time but it'd still return because the food is very good

I was glad to find a Dentist so close to home and open on Saturdays. I'm 3 minutes away. How convenient is that?  My very 1st visit and I was instantly impressed with the laid back feel I got when I walked in.   The staff are very pleasant,  and knowledgeable. I even received a tour of the office and history on Dr.Sadyk which was very nice.   After meeting him and going over everything, I feel better about the treatment plan that he's come up with. I look forward to seeing the results and will recommend him to my family and friends.

Our first time at this location. Stopped in on NYE before heading to the Laugh Factory. The food was excellent as always and the wine was even better.   Ambience is great here and not too loud. I'm never disappointed.

I'm not impressed with this place. It was soo loud and overcrowded and it just feels like you rush through eating just to get out of there!   It's overpriced but I may give it another try on a different night just to see if there's a difference.

I love this place! The wait was less than 10 minutes,  the staff was knowledgeable and we got our food right away.   I ordered the bacon wrapped chicken which was juicy and tender. The roasted garlic mashed potatoes were the best I've ever tasted and the orange scicle martini was very good.   I plan to come back soon.

Very nice place! Love the fact that I can still walk into a place and turn heads. I love it! The service was great!  Tried the Bruschetta Sampler that I've heard so much about with a bottle of Prosecco. It was fantastic! I'm definitely bringing all my girlfriends here for a night out!

As i mentioned before. I love my nails! Cici did a very nice job. Wasn't too thrilled to try the coffin nails but in the end they are fabulous.  Everyone is so nice and I was excited to see one of the ladies from my old shop here. I love that they do the color coordination with the staff,  it was a very nice touch.   Walking in,  I could already see why they're voted best nail salon. Keep up the good work. I'll come back here any day.

I'm sorry but who's doing the cooking in this place? That was the blandest mexican food I've ever had!   Dirty tables and silverware. The house margarita was watered down,  chicken was dry.   Not coming back here for food again!  Only thing with flavor was the mango margarita. .  Shape up people and quit hiring college kids as cooks. For God's sake. Taste your food people!

It is Friday September 4th 7:17 p.m. I stopped in at this location to get a monroe piercing and they were closed even though the sign says 9 p.m. they're all getting in their cars and closing up shop already so they suck that's not cool they just lost my business because I went elsewhere

First time here and I have to say it was very nice. The staff was very friendly.   The bacon was crisp, eggs were cooked very well the only things that I would say that needs improvement is the potatoes need seasoning but overall the food was very good. Can't wait to go back and see what they have on the menu for lunch

Thought I'd give this place another try. They didn't have what I wanted to order since I'm limited to what I can eat after surgery. The place was Empty when we arrived and hesitated before going in. I wasn't impressed and wont return again.

I'm soooo not impressed.  The house Margarita was just awful! 6 servers walked right past us,  never even acknowledge us. Smdh. I'll give them another chance when I come back to try the food but please steer clear of the house Margarita.

Decided to come back and try the food which was excellent we sat at the bar and then I had the most delicious spicy margarita I've ever tasted. Seems like they really improved on the house margarita this is what we had last time so I think this place is going to do very well
