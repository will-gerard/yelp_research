I use to be a member for years, though canceled my membership about 2 years ago. About a month ago I went in to get a new membership using my employers discount. The man that I was working with was difficult. He wanted to charge me more then what was discounted through my work. I even had the print out from work that I was to have brought in to prove I would get a membership at that rate. I was so frustrated. The man picked up on my frustration and started to down talk me saying I didn't print the right print out. I ended up walking out when he was talking because at that point he wouldn't shut up and listen. When I was about to the door he started making fun of the situation with the guy sitting next to him.   Never again will I be a member. I now go to 24 hr fitness on 43rd ave and bell.

Really liked Linda. I only had color done, but service was good. My daughter liked the waiting area. It was comfortable for her. The music videos were a bonus.

I really like the people that work there. They are very helpful and not in the annoying way. They welcome and leave you alone until you look lost then they ask for help and they wish you a be well on your way out. Great branding Walgreens. lol

I've been coming here on and off for the last 10 years. It's warming to see the same people there after all these years. The staff is personable and welcoming.

I recently had drinks and food with friends here. The service was awful! It took over 40 minutes to get my 2nd drink. In addition, they forgot two food orders. When I spoke with the manager he offered to take the items off my bill. I told him I will pay for the items I got. I was so frustrated because I just wanted him to listen to my complaint and he only kept throwing out excuses.

Virgina's House was a pleasure to work with. Natalie was very easy and comfortable to work with. I'm looking forward to having my wedding there this November. I recommend Virgina's House to anyone looking for an amazing patio wedding.

I love coming here with my wife. The food is typical nothing special; however, you pay for the ambiance.

I went to this location as it was the closest to me. Oh wow, I was impressed! I called the day before to make an appointment for new tires and it was so easy and fast. I went in the following morning for my appointment for new tires and they said my truck would be ready in 20 minutes.. I thought it was a joke, but really my truck was ready in 20 minutes. They were prepared and ready to serve. Great location with great management!

My friends and I get coffee from here daily. It's just a short walk from work and lines are ususally short. The staff are very friendly! Items are priced well. Although they have food I only go for coffee. The Chai Tea is a must! I have never been one for tea, but I'm addictied.

Such a fantastic place for kids 1-5. I took my daughter there when it first opened and again recently. She is now 9 and didn't find it entertaining at all.

I've never needed a window replacement in my life. When my window broke I was confused on who to even call, so I turned to Yelp. With as many reviews as Garcia's Windows & More has I was impressed, to say the least, on the 5 stars. I read the reviews and was very confident in my choice. Mark was able to come by the house to do an estimate within a matter of hours. He was very customer focused. He was easy to reach and provided updates on the special glass ordering. Within days I have a new window. I am very happy with my choice and will use Garcia's Windows & More again in the future. I recommend them to everyone! Great customer service and great price!

I went here once with one of my friends whom loves this place; however, this was not a place for me. The music was very loud in the lounge area and the place was uncomfortably over crowded.

Excited I was to attend my first boot camp. The reputation that is associated with the words boot camp was exactly what I was looking for to jump start my nagging urge to get in shape.   Background of me:  Like most women, my weight fluctuates. At my fittest I was a size 2/4. Here I sit a size 6 refusing to buy a needed size 8. Focus and drive are thing naturally in me. With the demands of work and my daughters social calendar I'm finding little time with me. So, I decided to join my friends in an 8 week Task Fitness boot camp special found via LivingSocial.com   My expectations of a boot camp class: A class's to challenge the mind and body. Motivation from relationships with the people around me. Encouragement from the trainer Pointers from the trainer FUN times.  I arrived early with a few friends. Slowly people started to come. The trainer, Aaron Nash, arrived right on time 7:30. After putting cones on the ground he stood before us and ensured all whom purchased the deal reclaimed the deal. We started with a five minute warm up. Aaron then proceeds to pull out a crumpled piece of white lined paper from his right pocket and reads off the first set of strength training moves. He showed us one time what we needed to do, watched his watch and said go. This nonchalant manner continued the rest of the night.  He would pull out his paper, read and show once then look at his watch and say go. His instructions lacked to say the least. By the 3rd circuit I found myself on my yoga mat, as the feeling of defeat came over me. I am out of shape, yes. However, I'm a very athletic person having played sports all through life and run often. These exercises were obtainable; however, I was beyond disappointed in the lack of motivation.   Had I paid full price for these classes I would demand a refund!   I will attend the Wednesday class in hopes that it will be better; however, I would caution anyone who buys this to think again. If you want motivation you will not find it.... at least not with this trainer.

The line is always out the door and around the corner. The food wasn't worth it.
