My favorite course in the valley.  Not fancy, not expensive, the golf is awesome, great views, great staff, great men's club.  My only concern going forward is ASU taking over... Tee times are going to be hard to come by, and that is too bad.  I really wish ASU would keep Karsten around and leave this course to Phoenix...

Service was good. Food wasn't. Tasted very greasy and like they have not cleans the fryers in a while. Extremely disappointed. Won't be back....

Boris is awesome. He does good work at a reasonable price. He is extremely friendly and has gone out of his way to accommodate me (has stayed late when I call). In another review someone complained about it being dirty. The inside can use some updating but the place is fine. The more important part is you will receive a good haircut. Boris is my regular barber and I would recommend him to anyone....

Played there today.  Course is in excellent shape!  Second time here and am thrilled with both the layout and OB card rates....  I will be back.  The views are great.  Yes, there are power lines but it is not a big deal.  This course has very nice views.

This place is great!  It would get that last star if they did not limit us to irons...  Someone made a big boo boo when they opened this place and did not design the range to support long woods or hybrids... Other than that the place is a lot of fun.

One of the best hot dogs I've ever had. I love this place and was so disappointed when they left Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona... It's been a ritual when we go up there for a Simons Hot Dog and beer... Now Simons is 2 miles from home and I am so very happy about this. Cowboy Dog is my favorite.
