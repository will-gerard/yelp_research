I purchased a Groupon for a shellac manicure & pedicure. Both services were performed by the self proclaimed "only full time manicurist." She complained about how little money she actually makes on each Groupon and basically threw a pity party. I finally told her I would have never visited the salon if not for the Groupon, so she should be thankful for the advertising. The shellac manicure looks horrible (uneven and bled into my cuticles) and the pedicure wasn't much better.  I won't go back.

The owner is (for lack of a better phrase), a business-incompetent jerk.  I will NEVER return to Duke's. There are amazing restaurant choices nearby that I highly suggest everyone support.  Bad business should not be encouraged.

I had a fantastic experience at Town and Country!  I am a second-time car buyer (first time, bought new; second time, wanted a more expensive model that I couldn't afford new), but was dreading the process of dealing with a "used car salesman."  I can truly say purchasing through Town and Country (Ron and Jay were my salesmen) was a pleasurable experience.  I am very rarely inclined to write a Yelp review, but I feel these folks deserve it. I will refer all of my friends to Town and Country Motors.

We've visited Sakura twice since it's opening, and have been very impressed both times.  The food is outstanding and the service is top notch.  Highly recommended!

Roger has been coloring/highlighting/cutting my hair for two years now, and I cannot imagine using anyone else! He is absolutely incredible at his craft, and a true hair artist.
