"R.S.V.P. Realty has been in business since 1972. We successfully lease and manage properties throughout the Southeast Vally as well as List and Sell Properties throughout the entire Valley of the Sun."  Well I haven't been with them since 1972 but since October 2006.  The property we rent is straight out of the 70's-from the appliances to the blue/grey carpet  Not purchase quality but ok for renting. The front yard rocks a rocky landscape. Yay no grass to cut, right?!  Wrong not when they decide to put rocks down without a tarp.  On three separate occasions we have been given 3 days to pull those stray weeds and grass growing through the rocks or else they will hire someone and charge us for it.  One time which I believe was the maintenance guy getting back at us for having to come fix our A/C in the middle of July.   Fine we agreed to upkeep the yard when we signed the lease.  We also agreed to not lick the walls-the schnozberries taste like schnozberries.   Do I have 3 days to stop doing that? I don't really have any complaints about the company itself.  The maintenance is always speedy and besides the weed picking they don't ever bother us plus we have until the 5th of the month to pay rent before it's considered late-upgrade.  One complaint-the holiday card.  I'd say it's disappointing, if you're going to send out cards it has to have everyone on the cover sporting cheesy Christmas attire with so and so who hates so and so placed next to each other forced to look chipper for the holidays.  Sigh, maybe next year.

My dog was bit by a spider and instead of spending the $90+ to visit a vet I instead went to Petsmart to purchase what they would of charged me to put on, a cone.  I chose this location because it was conveniently close to my work and I was able to skip on over on a break.  Once there I was immediately asked if I need assistance which I did I was in a hurry.  The sales associate showed me the cones and their color variety.  She insisted that the medium would be the correct size for my Jack Russel Terrier weighing in at 15lbs.  Are you sure? his neck is just a tiny one I say.  Yes she insist again.    The medium was too large.  I returned to Petsmart but this time with an entourage or 2 fellow stoners who had nothing better to do.  No problem exchanging the cone for a small.  Well there was a little bit of stupidity from the sales associate handling my return, like her asking for my receipt when I just handed it to her with the cone but that's acceptable.  What was unacceptable was the poor lizard we saw licking his dried water bowl repeatedly hoping that somehow maybe come his next lick there will be water in his bowl.  We immediately told the first sales associate we could find...I'll take care of it she says.  Nothing happens she continues to count fish.  I then decide to tell the manager who had been trying to impress me during my exchange of course mentioning how we already informed someone else and nothing has been done.  Finally our lizard friend was back on his way to hydration!!    I give this location 2 stars because the store seemed dirty and the employees didn't seem to care about the store nor anything else in it...the reptiles ect that they sell.  But they did have what I needed at a reasonable price and I was able to get in and out.

Last December after quiting my job I quickly needed something to pay the bills.  After having trouble on my own I decided to test my luck with a temp agency and let them do all the selling for me.  I went into their office to have a sit down with one of the reps, which consisted of me telling my rep what kind of job I would like and the wage I was willing to work for.  I then spent over an hour  taking tests to figure out my customer service capabilities.   After I finished my tests there at their office I was instructed to go home where they would be emailing me links to take more tests of my knowledge of programs such as Outlook, Excel, and Word.  That took about another hour.  So now I have spend 2hrs taking tests for these people they are sure to find me a job right?!  WRONG...  Days went by, weeks even started going by, thank god I had a holiday job..I did get some offers but nothing that was worth working for. Correct me if I'm wrong I did tell you the wage I was looking for when I spent an hour at your office did I not?!?! I gave up hope on Apple One and found the job I am at right now and going strong.  Apparently they don't update their system that often and have recently started emailing me about job possibilities again.    I gave Apple One 1 star because they didn't help me at all.  Instead they wasted my time which I'm sure I returned the favor and wasted their time!  They did help me a bit though by getting my butt into gear and doing shit on my own!

It's a dollar store so not much to expect but some quality people watching.  The product selection is so-so with generic brands of most of your favorite snacks, cleaning products, ect.  While browsing the snack aisle I can not help but hear a mother yelling obnoxiously for her son repeatably as if they were at their own house and not in a public location.  Very annoying.  Once the boy, I'd say who is about 4 or 5 yrs old, comes out of hiding he is waddling down the aisle to confront his mother where she asked "what is wrong?  Did you poop your pants?"  Yes the boy confesses.  "Well guess you learned a lesson, I'll clean you up when we leave" and continues to shop with the boy waddling behind.  I purchase my stuff and take off.  As I'm driving out of the parking lot I notice the lady and her son now outside of the store with his pants dropped bent over and her wiping his bum right there in front of the store!  Have you no shame?!  Since this last experience I have decided that an extra dollar or so an item is definitely worth not having to view such trash like this.

A bookstore in a mall... genius!  WRONG not when you work there and your General Manager is a selfish idiot.   I have not been back since I left this horrible job but I do hope that things have straightened themselves out and that they fired that bitch Marcie.    I  mean what kind of company keeps a General Manger who walks out of her store seeing a line that has grown 20 people deep with the phones ringing off hook and not to mention the lack of staff on the sales floor to assist those growing impatient customers.  I can't even tell you how many times I had to take customer complaints about the lack of staff.     As far as product they might say they have it but good luck at finding it.  These high school seniors and freshman college students they hire have far better things on their minds (themselves) and could care less where they have shelved  that book you are now looking for.   Now if it's a best seller you'll have no problem finding it since it will be displayed on tables and end-cap displays through out the store and depending on the season possibly displayed in a floor stack as well...after all they did receive 50 copies of the book to begin with and receive an additional 12 when 1 is sold. As for  CD's and DVD's since you are already at the mall I would recommend going somewhere else as they are far over priced at any Borders.  The only thing I would rave about is the magazine selection.  The Biltmore location will provide you with the widest variety but all locations have a ridiculous amount of titles.

I use to visit Sneakers quite frequently due to it's location.  The drink specials were also an influence.  $ 2drafts on Thursdays, $2 wells for ladies on Fridays, domestic deals through out the week. The smell problem that once took place in the bathroom area has disappeared and they have added a fire pit outside, which really is only a good investment for about 2 out of the 12 months, but upgrade non the less.  There's pool tables, darts, basketball, and some other arcade games. I never have had a problem getting a drink and getting it quick. My last visit however has left an impression that has kept me from walking back through those doors.  A couple friends and myself went to watch the 2nd half of the Suns game and enjoy some $2 drafts not knowing we were entering a Frat initiation.  White undershirts and sharpies everywhere....sign my shirt, WHEW Frat 2008... because of this event I, not in a white sharpied up t-shirt, had to drink my Blue Moon out of a plastic cup.  All of a sudden I'm put on the same level as these douchebags and can't be trusted with a glass glass!   Come on I didn't walk in Wheewing and slurring my words.  I won't lie sitting around the fire pit was a bit amusing though, Sorority chics are pretty easy....I'd guess alot of those Frat boys woke up the next morning not only with hangovers but an STD or two....some probably even woke up with a dick on their face, a sharpie drawn dick that is.    So Sneakers I will of course visit again, it's close to my house, but I think I'll call first to make sure there aren't any "special" events going on.
