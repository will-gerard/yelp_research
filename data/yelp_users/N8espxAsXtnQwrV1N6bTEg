Love this place. I come here all the time and everything is great. You can tell the proprietors are really passionate about what they're doing here.

I've been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please.  Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...?  Really?!

Before I came to Shampoo Ink, I had never paid more than $20 for a haircut. My hair just wasn't something I spent a whole lot of money on. But after my first appointment with the amazing and beautiful Sonia, I was hooked. Abel and Sonia are so warm, friendly and down to earth. They are also truly artists and listen to what you want, then exceed your expectations. I never got color done, but we talked about a few times and Sonia was great at listening and talking with me about what will and won't work for me. I fully trust her opinion and skill. Most of the time, I just sat down and said "Do whatever you think will look good!", and I always walked out impressed and happy. The interior space is great - exposed brick, grey walls, fantastic art and amazing music. Pricing is completely reasonable and you get free bang trims in between cuts, which is much needed for me.   I just moved out of Phoenix and am not looking forward to finding a new place to get my hair done because Shampoo Ink is definitely one of a kind. I'll be making an appointment with Sonia every time I come home. (And hoping that the tattoo studio will be open soon!)

Kristine is an amazingly talented photographer. She makes you feel so comfortable and at ease, and she captures that natural quality in her photographs. I also love her use of light and the vibrant colors in her work. She is really great with children, which is also evident in her family portraits. Kristine is detail-oriented and a perfectionist in the editing process; her finished photos are flawless. I am so looking forward for her to do my engagement photos!!!
