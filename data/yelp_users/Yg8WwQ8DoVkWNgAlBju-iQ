I first have to say that I love Red Robin. We always go for my birthday every year. That being said, we have been to the Red Robin in Gilbert twice now and the service has been sub-par both times. We went to lunch today to celebrate my husband's birthday this Sunday. Our server was kind but not very good at her job. I ordered a coffee that was never refilled, she forgot to take our order completely the first time and had to come back and get our order a second time. By the time the food came my husband and I had lost our appetite from eating the appetizer and sitting for 15 minutes. Besides the bad service, the restaurant was dirty. The women's bathroom was out of toilet paper and I saw lots of staff members just standing around instead of cleaning up the place. It comes down to bad management. Whoever is in charge needs to step up their game or find a different career that doesn't require supervising staff.

David was able to fix my old broken computer and get it running like new again. I had given up hope that my custom computer would be able to be fixed. I brought the computer to David and he was able to change the defective motherboard to a new motherboard and now you would never know my computer is almost 10 years old! He saved me a bunch of money because I was going to have to buy a new computer.   So glad I found David and now my computer is all fixed! I will definitely be using David for all my computer needs in the future. He even has some high quality used computers for sale so when I need another computer, I know where I will go.

We had a Pinal County Chamber Mixer at Valentino's last night. There were about 40 people in attendance. The service was amazing. My husband and I were asked about drinks right away and ordered the fried calamari and cup of soup each.   The soup was yummy and the calamari was crispy and delicious. The bread that was brought to the table was really good and had a delicious red dipping sauce.  I really enjoyed our time at Valentino's and was very impressed how they handled our large group of people.

I had an amazing time on this tour today with my Meet to Eat Group! We enjoyed some delectable goodies and our tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable. Downtown Scottsdale is such a fun place to walk around on its own but add the chocolate to the experience and it makes it just amazing! I would highly recommend taking your out of town guest on this tour, going during a date, or with a group of friends. There was even a solo person on our tour and they seemed to have a great time as well.

I finally cashed in my Christmas Present Gift Certificate for Relaxology today. It was an amazing experience! The best massage I have ever had. Very friendly staff and inviting environment. The massage was both relaxing and therapeutic. I could tell my masseuse knew what she was doing and I could feel the tension being released in places I didn't even know I needed a massage.   Will definitely be returning for another massage their in the future.
