Actual shopping trip yesterday afternoon:  *Walks to express checkout line with giant tub of Smart Balance imitation butter and places it on non-moving beltway*  "Hello, did you find everything you are looking for today?"  "Yep"  "Do you have your Safeway card?"  "Don't have one."  "First time here? Would you like to sign up?"  "Not really, Safeway's are laid out really strange, the shelves are too high and intimidate me, and this place closes ridiculously early."  "Oh...the residents around here don't shop very late."  "I live around here. And I tried to buy a bottle of wine with a friend here at 10:15 PM last weekend and was turned away. We had to buy a bottle of Pinot Grigio at the Circle K."  "Oh, sorry too here that."  "That's alright, it was surprisingly tasty. Reminded me of Lollapalooza."  "You need any help out of the store?"  *Stares blankly at cashier* (I am a strapping 6'3" lad with no obvious physical defects)  *Cashier does shifty eye, waiting for response*  "I did just buy a tub of butter, right? Did I win something? Or accidentally buy a truckload of potatoes?"  "No, just seeing if you need assistance." (Maybe he was worried about me when I confessed their high shelves intimidate me?)  "Alright then, I'm going to go make some Salmon Baklava then."  *Scampers away. Scoffs at posted hours.*

I heard about this guy Sarah K. went out with on 12/12. They didn't quite click, but he sounded up my alley. We totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights. Then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices. This is how I feel about Fate.

3.5 stars. New York style deli very much like Miracle Mile, except family owned and just done better.   Ingredients and preparation match authentic NY delis for me. However, my friend who has had more experience going to such places in NY says its lacking. I think he's just suffering from a nostalgia complex, I don't know how you could make a Straw sandwich any better. Although, technically the family who runs it are New Hampshire/Massachusetts transplants.   They also supposedly have the best hot dogs. I have seen them and they are extremely large and impressive looking. I don't eat hot dogs, but I'm guessing they are awesome since I have eaten their sauerkraut which is money.  Gets the bump to four stars for having some cool photographs of Phoenix architecture through the centuries.

this is my favorite music venue in phoenix. it is a smaller venue best for local or indie bands, but every show i've been to their has been far more memorable then any show i've been to in phoenix.  the place itself isn't too stunning, it is just a rectangular brick building with a bar area on the right when you walk in, booths on the left side of the wall, some high tables in the middle, a stage and standing area at the back, and an eclectic mix of art on the walls. however, the place has a really good feel to it and excellent sound that leads to really wild and memorable concerts.  the two that i remember the most were the presets/the rapture and spinto band/art brut/we are scientists. i thought the presets were pretty lousy until i saw them play there and the rapture played an absolutely amazing set that lasted almost 2 hours and inspired an epic, comfortably out-of control dance party. the other show was equally long and boisterous, highlighted by eddie argos coming out into the crowd to sing 3 songs.  the bad things about the place are that last time i went there was still no alcohol because they lost their liquor license. however, i heard that they have got it back now, but i'm not sure. the shows i went to i had to go down the street between sets and drink at alice cooperstown which isn't cheap.   it also doesn't have a patio at all where you can hang out and hear the music or what is going on inside and drink or smoke. the venue reminds me alot of the lounge in the back of Plush in tucson except for the lack of a patio which is really important in a state like AZ where the weather is so good at night most of the year.  of course the worst thing is just the lack of bands that go there. most bands come to either marquee (heaven help us poor phoenicians) or even worse, the clubhouse. if you happen to be a tour manager reading reviews on yelp, please book your band at the brickhouse.  Update - 8/31 - Had to downgrade to 4 stars after my most recent visit. Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening.   They normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.  They also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.  They are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.

This is my favorite Mexican lunch destination downtown. I've started coming here once or twice a week because they have a huge, cheap, and pretty interesting menu as well as a great bakery.  The one star off is unfortunately for the main course there. There has always been something a little off in everything I or someone else gets there when I've gone. They have great freshly made tortillas, but the filling for the Vegetarian is pretty bland if you ask me. A friend got a Carne Asada burrito and he said the meat was pretty fatty. They have an interesting selection of tamales but they've all been kindof bland as well. The tacos have always been the best, but it's pretty hard to screw up a taco.  But they have a whole bunch of unexpectadly weird dishes for a cheap counter service Mexican place like Potato tortas and aforementioned large tamale selection including fruity tamales that make it so you can have something different every time you come.   But my favorite part is getting something from the bakery after the meal. Check out the pic on their website of their selection, it is very impressive. The highlight for me is the carmel filled churros, which when served fresh, will make you see God.  They have  a cool market with hard to find tools to make your own Mexican feast, a meat counter, and rockin' Horchata too.

a great laid back bar with tons of comfy booths, carlsberg on tap,  plenty of english football and memrobilia, and a lot of good people.   as others have said, the place has an edge to it pretty much just because of its location in the art district. its one of the great laidback bars for the hipster/punk crowd next to shady's and the paper heart. its a great place to go before/after first friday or roller derby. and just a great place to hang out or warm up before going elsewhere.  the one star off is for the food there which is pretty lackluster. its a little on the expensive side and comes in small portions and pretty mediocre quality. definitely not the best fish and chips you will ever have.   i would stick to the great beer selection which yes, includes carlsberg on draft. i haven't found another place in arizona which even sells carlsberg in bottles, but then there aren't many english pubs in arizona.  the no EPL ticket is pretty lame though, they really need to shell out the dough for that.

This place has always seemed to me about as close as you can get to a "Cheers" in downtown Phoenix. Except that nobody seems to know my name there in spite of how frequently I come. But then, I'm not part of the 30-something clientle who sets up shop at the bar.  I roll into a booth or a high table that has the best view of the games that are on. It's a great place to come down and see local sports or tie one on after a terrible local sports performance. Not great because of the televisions or presentation of the games in any way(which is just two smaller flat screen TVs with no sound in the main room), but because of the laid-back, true-to-its-locale atmosphere it emits. It just seems perfectly in place and makes it feel natural  to hang out and throw some back more then any other bar around town that tries to force its motif into a Phoenix landscape it just doesn't jive with.  And of course the food and beverage there don't hurt its cause at all. I do agree with some people's sentiments about particular beers not being up to snuff compared to other breweries. My particular complaint is with their Pale Ale, which tastes like an IPA, and their IPA, which tastes like a medicinal strength IPA. But in spite of some quibbles with the beers here, they really do have some fantastic stuff. For some reason, the beer that is my standby there is the Light Rail Cream Ale, which is in stark contrast to the Brown and Amber Ales I typically get at other breweries. Its got that perfect taste/refreshment balance that acts as a Siren's call to bring me back here at least once a week.  The burgers, salads, and pizza's are also fantastic. But the real find here is the bread pudding, which has got to be one of the best bread pudding's in existence. I always try to eat slow to make room for it. Luckily, this is a place that won't care how long you cement yourself to a seat.  Which again, makes this place perfect for some Suns action or whatever is going on. But I probably remember my trips here best after catastrophic defeats. Last year after the Sun's officially bowed out of the playoffs without a championship for yet another season, and with my brother after ASU (he's an alum) lost to Oregon are the first that come to mind. The classic rock and the atmosphere and the beer (don't forget the beer) seem to breath new life into me during such trying circumstances. I guess just by being a pillar of originality in the desert.

Finally had my first Rhythm Room experience last night which is incredible because I moved within walking distance of it 5 months ago. I took full advantage of such for the VHS or Beta/Walter Meego show by getting my pre-party on at my place, walking over, and going through a small kaleidescope of drinks there to gauge their prices and quality.  G&T's were 4 dollars, small, and not that alcoholic or tasty. Pretty disappointing for a hole in the wall bar on a Tuesday night. Next I went to Stella which was 4.50, also disappointing. Next, I struck paydirt when I got a can of PBR which was on special for 1.50. 1.50! There was a huge sign too! How did I miss that! I made sure to atone for my mistake by drinking as many as possible during the VHS or Beta performance.  The venue itself is not incredibly moving, but serviceable. Just a rectangular, closed off brick building painted black on the inside with no decorations other then some blue tube lighting around the bar and some broken down ceiling fans. I'm fine with a broken down old music venue for a show, but this place doesn't seem like it was ever much. I think they could do a little something to give it more character.   Also disappointing was the HUGE smoking patio which has no view of the inside and you can't bring a drink out. Why is this happening at places like here and the Lost Leaf?  But overall I still had a great time at the show and was very appreciative of the 1.50 PBR special. Plenty of bar stools around the place (where you can still have a great view of the stage) to sit during open acts and breaks is also a huge plus. 3.5 stars.

Ordered a Bean and Cheese Burrito the other night in the drive-thru, didn't know I mistakingly ordered the Lard and Cheese Burrito. Three of the worst dollars I've ever spent.  As far as drive-thru Mexican places I've given a try in my day (and I've given a few too many a try), this might be the worst.  I've yet to find a really good dirty taco shop around downtown, but the Filberto's by Glam is a lot better.

I've had only one experience in this Apple Store. Or any apple store for that matter. I mean, people buy computer products from stores still?  The only reason I could see coming here is to have some Apple product fixed, which has also only happened to me once. I mean my iPods have had their series of strange fits, including my new iPod always crashing for some reason whenever it plays an ELO song. I can't decide if it hates ELO or if its prog-rock power completely blows its mind.  But I digress. My powerbook indeed did have a real problem when its Hard Drive appeared to flat out die. I go online and see you can make a reservation at the "Genius Bar", which seemed lame but I did it anyway.  I show up about 10 minutes before my appointment and one of the Geniuses starts calling out names, but since none of them are there I get to go early. This friendly (and in actuality, pretty smart guy) then spends around 30 minutes with my power book trying to see if he can do anything to get the HD back in working order as well as examining the laptop to see if anything else is wrong with it.   He passed down the unfortunate verdict that my HD was deceased and needed to be replaced and that nothing else seemed wrong with my powerbook. He looked up how much it would cost because I didn't have a warranty on the powerbook. (People have warranties on Apple Products?) He came up with a pricey number that I almost considered for a second, but before I could respond he told me that would be dumb to pay. He gave me a card for a Mac store that would be much cheaper. He then also gave me a card to what was according to him the best data recovery store in the city. He then sent me on my merry way completely free of charge.  I used to work at a service desk for a Gateway Country back in the day and I would have been fired for telling a customer to go somewhere else for cheaper. Here they seem to encourage it with stacks of business cards at the Genius bar. I also wouldn't/couldn't spend 2 minutes with a customer with a broken computer. Or do anything for free. And even for a fee there was no service there or at most big box stores to work through problems side-by-side with a customer.  This experience was a first for me in my history of shopping at a large corporations store. I'm not sure what is going wrong with all the other trips reported here (or why people are buying things at a store), but I was completely dumbfounded at how helpful and free the service is at this store just because I bought a product from their corporation.

no one has reviewed this place? really? i guess i shouldn't be surprised because when i first moved back to phoenix and someone said we should go bowling in sunnyslope i thought they were on meth. and the bowling alley would prolly be a great place to score some more.  even when you see it from the outside, you will be like "uh-uh, i ain't goin in there." but the inside of this place has been DRASTICALLY remodeled from its early days. it is actually the nicest and coolest bowling alley i've ever been in.   its got an awesome bar with flat screens and great beer on tap including stella. its got some pretty good pop art hand painted all over the place. and just overall they did an amazing job with all the furniture, carpet, and carpentry required to turn a p.o.s. bowling alley into a great hangout.  they of course do the friday and saturday night late night bowling thing. it's actually been the best when the guy who runs the counter just picks the music, a lot of indie rock and other good stuff. other times i've been there when they hired a d.j. it has been less inspiring.  but overall this place is awesome. if you haven't been yet you need to give it a try despite its absolutely terrible location.

For me, this is a chain that really does a good job delivering a mass-produced experience.   What is most amazing to me is how fresh and tasty the tomatoes and tomato sauce are for a chain the couple of times I've gone to a Buca. It makes even simple dishes like eggplant parmesan really good.  I've also had fine experiences with the wine and tiramasu they have that can make a family or friendly gathering at a suburban chain a good time. Or you can just go with a date and start a bottle of wine and sneak the rest into to the Harkins theatre thats right by there.  The comfy booths and attentive service has always helped as well. This location also features a seemingly long lost Wilson brother waiter. You'd swear working at a suburban Phoenix Buca was part of Owen's rehab program. He's got some pretty good indie movie recommendations too.

This is a chain that definitely deserves to be shunned and avoided like the plague.  I went there for the first time for a birthday dinner for my Mom which was decided on because it supposedly had a fun atmosphere and had a diverse menu. I had high hopes when I walked in because I did dig the interior design and our comfy booth. But the bizzare pacific rim/sandwiches/seafood/steakhouse menu doesn't match its East African/Elephant theme at all.  I tried a shrimp adventure platter which boasted some coconut, Teriyaki, and fried shrimp. The coconut and fried shrimp were far worse then even what you get at Red Lobster or Trader Joe's. The coconut were completely flavorless and a huge disappointment. My Teriyaki shrimp came out cold and I had to get them re-done. The dipping sauces where pretty much Kroger-brand quality.  Worse, is that the food made me and most of the other people in my party queezy afterward. Had to take some acidophilus to calm our stomachs down.  We also had pretty much every bad service experience one could have. We ordered an appetizer which they brought out two minutes before our food was ready, they forgot to make one of our entrees, part of my entree was cold, waitress left us without beverages for long stretches, waitress asked us if we wanted desert multiple times, waitress rang our bill up wrong.  In short, terrible Grocery store food packaged well and served to you for 15 dollars a plate.

I saw the review of the day today and had to throw in my two cents. This is my least favorite lunch stop I've ever been to downtown.   It's usually suggested by someone in the office who just wants a red sandwich meat sandwich and wants it fast. Then the rest of us have to suffer too.   Very typical sandwiches like turkey, roast beef, etc, etc. I might like the place better if I ate alot of red meat. The people I go with swear that the "Traffic Jam" sandwich (a cluster fuck of different red sandwich meats) makes it worth the trip. The toppings are very pedestrian and limited. They will charge you to put something "fancy" like black olives on it.  I would also challenge the "clean" assertion made by another reviewer. Although they have a ton of employees to run a pretty tight ship in terms of making sandwiches quick and cleaning up, we have had several incidents of finding questionable or disgusting items in the food we've ordered so as to make many  people in my office never want to go back.  I give them one star for making a decent sandwich that I could've made just as easily at home and for cheaper. The second star is for their milkshakes which are made with real ice cream in front of you and are pretty good. Go to Sacks, duck and decanter, downtown deli, or one of dozens other downtown sandwich places first before here.

How backward must a local channel be, to have the rights to broadcasting the biggest television event in America, and not be able to stream weather warnings across the bottom of the screen without interrupting the HD signal?  And just for the record, I don't give a rat's ass that there is winter storm warning in Northern Arizona, and even if I did it wouldn't matter since I'm busy staying indoors, watching the Super Bowl.  A station this awful should really be the partner of NBC so we could lump everything that is terrible about major network television together with the hokey, backwoods morons at channel 10.

Such a waste. Great little cozy Mexican restaurant for a business lunch that somehow forgot 1) how to make Mexican food and 2) how to cater to larger groups on their lunch break.  You will fall in love with its quaint, wooden interior and carafes of salsa, but the love affair will start to wain once you realize how shoddy and unorganized the service is. It's one of those serve tables by committee places where no one will claim responsibility of any table that's out there. As such, you will go through long stretches without key elements for eating your meal and either be ignored or treated rudely when you ask for help.  But the real deal-breaker for me in my one (and probably final) trip here was the food. I got a "Carne Asada Taco" platter, which turned out to be a loose definition for what I got. There was a stack of four tiny, over-saturated tortillas with some carne asada on it. No guacamole, no pico, or anything else. Just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky, wet tortillas. Also came with almost tasteless beans and rice on the side.  The carne asada itself was really good and some members of my party had slightly better entrees, including the ones who got carne asada burritos which were loaded with guac and such, but we all agreed it wasn't worth the price compared to a trip to Tradiciones, La Tolteca, or even Canasta.  Then we got presented with a bill that included an auto-gratuity of almost 30%. We brought it up to the woman who was running the joint for the most part and took our orders and told her to sort that out. She apologizied and said, "Oh, she can put on whatever gratuity she wants."   Say what? Who is "she"? You are the only one running the register and taking orders. And how can any server just come up with a gratuity of 30%? Needless to say this place is trying to shakedown large business parties and should be avoided as much as possible.

I thought my co-workers were pulling me leg until I actually saw the sign at Lo-Lo's for the first time. Chicken and waffles?!? People do that? It seemed like a cultural tradition I really needed to start embracing.  And if you make the trip and are prepared to wait around an hour in eager anticipation of such a feast, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. It's a converted house without much in the way of seating and usually plenty of people ready to raise their cholesterol levels a couple notches. We've even had several celebrity sightings going there to add to the commotion. As such, you typically wait 30 minutes for a table at lunch time unless you get there early. You will also likely spend an hour or more at the table with the glacial Southern service.  You have to get chicken and waffles the first time you go, preferably with a side and some of their red velvet cake to go. But they have several other unhealthy options and a good amount of breakfast food if that's what your in the mood for. But make no mistake, there is NO healthy option at this place. Don't go there unless you are ready to indulge.  I would also strongly recommend NOT going there with large groups. I see there are 4 votes for "Good for Groups" for this place. That is insane. There are hardly any tables and large groups bring the place to grinding halt. Go with 4 or 5 people max.

I hate assigned seats at a concert venue. Especially in today's internet purchasing age where all you can do is pray to the music Gods that you are going to get a good seat. You sit patiently in front of your seat, constantly reloading a page as the internet sale begins to make sure you are right there when it starts. You request seats in what must be 10 seconds after the sale started, and the best seats you can get are in the 26th row off center. WTF do you have to do to get a set of the primo seats just fucking once?  The consolation for seated venues is that it is usually in a great outdoor amphiteater where you can kick back and enjoy your reserved space under the stars. Or its in an art-deco revival theater that is an amazing setting for a show.   But here at Dodge, there is no consolation prize. Its boxy, boring, and cold. They went to no expense whatsoever to dress up the Dodge or make it an interesting place to see a concert. Its gray, drab, and would totally put you to sleep if it didn't have an amazing soundsystem powered by some top notch acts that play here.  In addition, it has some seating that in no way, shape, or form should be sold at full price. The seats at the far left and right sections of the main area should be avoided at all costs. They are commonly as much as any other seat in the house, but are at such a sharp viewing angle that you can only see the front of the stage. I saw a Cure concert from there recently and never was able to confirm if they in fact had a drummer in the band.  And to top it off you are likely going to have to pay hefty ticket prices at about 50-100 dollars, have about 15 dollars in fees per ticket, and have to pay 10 dollars for low quality brews.  To enjoy this place you need to REALLY want to see whoever plays here, have some good friends with you, drink heavily before the show, stay away from the seats at the far sides, show up just in time for the show, and be ready to indulge in the intense sound this place produces because there is nothing else here that is going to entertain you.

A dive bar without shuffleboard doesn't deserve 5 stars.  But the bikini is good times as long as its not too crowded and doesn't have a DJ. I don't understand the people here who like a DJ at a dive, seems so wrong to me.  They also have serious problems keeping their mixers carbonated. I've been served more flat G&Ts here then at every other bar I've ever been to combined. So I stick to the PBR.  But I've got a lot of good memories from this place. Mostly when they stay open past legal hours. No better way to prepare yourself for family time at a Thanksgiving feast then to get completely trashed until 3am at a dive the night before.

The good: 1) A great all you can eat chip bar with some pretty decent hot sauce. 2) A big patio to take a relaxed lunch at. 3) These crazy good green corn tamales with a strange cheese filling that is more like Kanufa then anything I've had at a Mexican restaurant.  The bad: pretty much everything else. The food is around (but below) drive through Filberto's quality at near restaurant prices. They even have the gaul to charge 2.25 for their crappy iced tea you serve yourself.  The worst part of this place is the meat they serve in their dishes which is absolutely horrid except for their machaca. I stick to bean burritos, cheese enchiladas, and the aforementioned green corn tamales if I go.  All of their tortillas and such taste store bought even though I think they make them themselves. And the horchata needs to be avoided at all costs as well.  For counter service Mexican, you gotta go with  La Tolteca if you are downtown. Or Caramba if you are on the west or north side.

There is something to be said for a giant  wheel o' shots with every 2 oz beverage imaginable on it that you can spin 3 times for 7 dollars. It adds unpredictability, value, and the excitement of a game show to a tacky night in Scottsdale. Saturday night, I was "lucky" enough to win a "Hot White Load" on the wheel. It's hilarity in name was equally matched by visual appeal of the drink itself. Some eerily seamen-colored butterscotch schnapps suspended like a mid-air ejaculation in some other harder, clear alcohol.  But game show tacky is about as high as this place can aspire. Complete with strong-man boxing machines, pirate decorations, bar swings, Bon Jovi blasting, 36 oz domestic bottles of beer everywhere, and midget led karaoke. If you are cohersed  into coming here, as I often seem to be with my Scottsdale friends, I recommend hitting the wheel as fast as possible and to try to enjoy the place for the carnival it is.  Although I don't know how it is possible as a female to do so. The thing about Scottsdale bars that always get to me is how seedy all the grown up frat boys and yuppies that frequent these establishments are once they get a couple of drinks in them. They treat it like once they reach a blood alcohol level of .08 on a non-school night, it gives them legal license to grab the ass or grind on any young female who comes within 3 feet of them.   Giligin's seems to be built for this purpose. A tiny little bar crowded with unwieldy wooden tables and carnival games with random crap happening at every little corner, which makes it almost impossible to maneuver around for another giant bottle of Coors Light and a shot of Pink Pussy without grinding on a couple people. The girls that we were with on Saturday seemed to constantly have a look of terror in their eyes which dashed around, like the islanders of Lost when they hear the sound of the Monster, whenever they hear another douche bag coming that will likely treat his beer run as license to get friendly with girls they don't know.  I talked to one girl I was with about it who lived right by Old Town and she seemed almost surprised when I told her there were bars in the town where you could go without any fear of random boob grabs. While I heard some dudes talk about where to score some good cocaine after my second Pink Pussy shot of the night, I told my friend who brought me there, "dude, next week I'm taking you to Chez Nous."

in a city with very little in terms of indie bars, this place is probably the best.   i'm not sure why people are so down on this place in yelp. i only go there on saturday nights, but the drinks are plenty strong (if not too strong), there are usually alot of people dancing come midnight, the staff and djs there are really cool, and the music is the best of any place in phoenix.  all that being said, it's not that great of a place. it's very small, has very little space at the bar, has no patio where you can drink, has virtually no parking, has about the worst public restroom situation you will ever find, and they constantly run out of certain beers like bass or harp.  its really dissapointing that the best venue that phoenix can do for it's best indie dance night is a dive like this place, but its still worlds better then paying assloads for the terrible music and people at scottsdale and tempe bars. it does feature some really cool decor, great giant plush booths, a pool table, an awesome juke box, cheap strong booze, and the best indie dance night in the city.

best brewery i've been to in phoenix other then the sonora brewhouse. it's off the beaten path and hard to find. even when you do, there still will be no parking. but its worth any frustration you have to go through.  its got a great selection of microbrews. i love the hop knot IPA. its really alcoholic and full of flavor with some kindof peach accent or something yet goes down really easy.  the food there is also awesome, i had a wood-fired bbq chicken pizza that was fantastic.  the place has tons of room so it easy to go there and get a table even with a large group during a busy time. there is also tons of outside seating which is great for a city like phoenix which has amazing afternoon weather 9 months of the year.  tons of big screen tvs too. would probably be a great place to watch the suns lose to mafia-paid referees.

i hate this place so so much. it makes it so hard to give it the two star rating i did which i have, but had to since it is a decent venue with decent sound that i have seen a few good shows at. but i still hate it so so much.  the parking situation is what gets me the worst. they take advantage of the fact that they have the only lot in the area you can park at and charge you 5 dollars. even if the concert ticket itself is only in the 6-12 dollar range on a Sunday-Thursday night.   the ridiculous fees are the next thing that pisses me off. they charge you several different fees when you buy tickets online including a facility fee. why?!? where are the facility improvements? its the same hollowed out dump of a theater its always been. you only charge those fees if you are actually doing something to improve the venue which they obviously don't care about.   if you wanna avoid fees by buying tickets the day of or by going to the box office before hand and at a local record store, they will still charge you some convenience fees! what the hell is wrong with these people?!? you can't charge convenience fees when you go to a box office or buy from a record store! you have been inconvenienced when you have to do this. what a bunch of soul-less, money-grabbing morons.  the next thing to take to task is the security. do you really need to search inside my shoes and make me leave my keyring in my car for a  my morning jacket concert? are there brawls or shivings at the indie rock and folk rock concerts they go to? you also aren't allowed to re-enter for any show.  the next thing is the drink prices which are typically lousy for phoenix shows. 5 dollars for a draft beer.   the fees, the parking, and the drink prices make in unafordable to go to indie rock shows in phoenix. this is especially terrible since 80% of the indie bands that come to phoenix come to this venue, even when its too large for them. it really hurts the indie culture compared to other cities where you can afford to go to several concerts a week. there seems is a real lack of comradery, consistency, and fellowship in the indie crowd in phoenix because of this piece of crap venue.   it is also making it so that phoenix is a spot that indie bands are sure to skip on their tours despite being the 5th biggest city in the U.S. i mean interpol/liars have 3 days between their california dates and a date in mexico and they aren't even bothering stopping here. that really says something about how little respect bands have for the venues in phoenix.  but i'm not even done yet. the venue itself is, just like others have said, a hollowed out theater with only a descent soundsystem for its size. almost all of the shows i have seen here have been extremely pedestrian. not memorable or worth the price of the admission. the only exception would be the faint shows that i've seen there. impossible to not have a good time at a faint show no matter how soul-less the venue.  tour managers for smaller indie bands, please book your bands at the brickhouse or rhythm room or mesa amphitheater or anywhere thats not the marquee or clubhouse.

I bought a "Crystal Pure" Reverse Osmosis system at Lowe's and this is the company that shows up to install it. They are supposedly the same company as Crystal Pure according to Lowe's.  If you are looking cross-eyed at the fact that i bought a Reverse Osmosis system because you don't know what the hell it is and are wondering if I'm caught up in the Texas UFO fever or something, it is just a water purification system that goes under your kitchen sink and can hook up to a tap on your sink and your refridgerator.   I don't think I would know what the hell an RO system is if I hadn't grown up with one, but now I can't live without one. I'm not sure how so many people do.  Their top-o-tha-line RO system cost 320, but came with a penny install special. It actually was a 20 dollar install special when I started the paper work at Lowe's, but while waiting for the Lowe's plumbing dude to finish the papers as a dozen people came up asking where light bulbs, garbage disposals, and paperweights were, the Crystal Pure rep called up and said it was now a penny install special. Everything comes up Mike!  There was an extra 60 dollar charge for running a line to my refridgerator and and 8 dollar charge for an upgrade to a primo EURO FAUCET (I know you're jealous), but all in all it was a pretty good deal for an awesome RO system. Especially with the 250 dollar Lowe's gift card I got from my work. HOLLA!  They were able to come the next weekend (although at 7 a.m.) to install it and did the whole setup in a little over an hour.  The system itself is incredible, way better then your Mom's RO system. The water and ice cubes taste great (in that they have no taste at all), but the real test was with this sweet little water tester they gave me that tests total dissolved solids in water to PPM.  Which leads me to my new favorite hobby, WATER TESTING. I know, I'm pretty exciting. Apparently the bare minimum for safe drinking water according to the EPA is 500 PPM. What does cenPho city tap water score??? A barely acceptable 440. Ouch. Screw plastic bags, I'd keep the kiddies away from running water.  When the RO system was first cooking it was scoring a 130 as it was working out the kinks. But last time I tested, it was down to a 30. This is awesome compared to Costco bottled water which is a 40. Although the unquestioned king of water, in case you are keeping score at home, is Sparklets water from my work which scored a perfect 0. Congrats, ladies and gentlemen.

awesome, family-owned greek and italian resturant with a brick oven for pizzas.  i usually get the pizza or one of their many baked pastas. most italian places have 0 or 1 baked pastas on the menu. this place has like a whole section. the orecchiette melanzana is absolutely amazing. house salads and bread with a hummus dipping sauce come with entrees.  they also have great deserts including two types of tiramasu, white and dark choclate.  the place is pretty affordable and has cheaper meals at lunch. if you are on the west side it is one of the places you have to check out along with touch of thai and china grill.

This place is a huge waste of the space they managed to acquire.   The one and only experience I had here was an all expenses paid work celebration happy hour, and it took all the good-humor I have in my body to have a decent time. It was hard just to stop myself from throwing bottles and stale chips at the staff and other patrons.   The happy hour was arranged because it was one of the members of our social team's favorite bars. They spent THOUSANDS of dollars to hold an event with a couple of free drinks and some vats of appetizers. All the food was a step down from Applebees at prices that would make even Matt Leinart cry. And the brew selection is absolutely abysmal and has no taps.  I don't understand what it is that drives Scottsdalites to blow a mortgage payment's worth of money each month on hang outs like this with nothing to do but stare at each other with awful domestic bottled beer and frozen Costco appetizers.  The evening only became notable for how beligerant I was able to get from hefty doses of gin and tonic to where I invented some drinking games that involved tossing their crap food around their tables in a bean-bag toss type game. I don't think we will be invited back and I am confident I don't care.

absolutely amazing place. it's hard to believe this place even exists in phoenix.  i've only gone their at lunchtime when they only serve sandwiches and salads. some of the best italian sandwiches i've ever had. they run about 9 dollars, but they are big and come with a salad.  you also have to split a strawberry nutella crepe for desert with somebody sometime. they are amazing.  only problem is trying to find parking and there is very little indoor seating, which makes it hard to eat at during the summer. but for the rest of the year, there is a great patio surrounded by greenery. great place to relax.  beware it also has some strange hours. no lunch on the weekends and there are some nights where they don't serve dinner.  the staff is also extremely friendly and helpful.  UPDATE - 09/24/2007 - I finally went to Cibo for dinner the other weekend and I can see why the reviews aren't as high as I would expect. The quality of the pizza is disappointing when compared to the quality of their sandwiches. However the pizza is still great (as well as affordable) and the atmosphere at this place is even better at night (especailly on an amazing night like last Friday).  But if you have been to Cibo for dinner and been dissapointed, I would recommend going and trying a Spek, Salsicca, or Vegetarian sandwich for lunch some day.

my favorite laid-back bar in phoenix. as close as you can get to che's or the bar part of plush(tucson bars) in phoenix.  unfortunately it isn't as big as plush which is its biggest downfall. they stick a whole bunch of comfy chairs in the center where there should be some empty space to stand and some high table to make it more comfortable. but when the place gets packed, the chairs make shady's the opposite of comfortable.  i also find the jukebox pretty lacking for the crowd that comes. it has very little indie music made in the last 10 years and a ton of R&B and random stuff from the 60s and 70s. i usually end up just putting on the clash, buzzcocks, david bowie, new york dolls, guided by voices, new order and such every time i go because there is not much more for the indie/punk crowd that is usually there. make's me pine for the jukebox at Che's in tucson which it is similar to in terms of the types of music, but hopelessly inferior to.  but overall its a great place for phoenix to hang out with friends at and warm up before going elsewhere. the mixed drinks are very strong and cheap and come in pint glass sizes. they also feature stella on tap and many other good beers. it's a really cool place as long as it doesn't get too crowded.

Looks like it is IKEA love/hate day on Yelp. Sounds like a great way to spend leap year day along with wearing whipped cream top hats, having sex on ladders, and putting my pigs in hammocks (a little inside joke for those who watched Conan last night).  Put me in the love category for IKEA. A ton of my furnishings and decorations have come from there without falling apart or making my home look like the set of the Real World.   I do think their couches are over-rated and that their desks are usually awkward or over-priced, but you can't beat them when it comes to outfitting a bedroom, shelving, home essentials, and random crap to give your place some character on the cheap.   Although I would stay away from the absolute cheapest stuff there, because it definitely won't stand the test of time and drunken fits of joy.  Although technically that T.V. stand I just destroyed was actually a coffee table and not meant to bear the weight of a 400 pound television. It might still be in my condo's dumpster if anyone's looking for some scrap cherry quarter inch wood.

What is with this wait that people complain about here?  I pretty much only go on Friday and Saturday nights around 7 or 8 pm and we usually get a table within 15 minutes or sit right down at the chef's table.  The parking is a nightmare, but I since given up on trying to find a regular parking spot after they expanded to like a dozen 15 minute spots. After one of their parking dudes they pay to stand around and make wild motions at BMWs told me just to park in one after I got screwed out of two spots that opened up for me I haven't looked back.  The pizza is absolutely perfect thin crust pizza. It is amazingly consistent in particular with its crust in comparison to places like Cibo where the pizza is hit-and-miss and the center of the pizza is often soggy.  They have some fancy combinations of pizzas available, but its really just the quality of the ingredients and the consistency of cooking that make it great. My stand-by is the avocado pizza with prosciutto. You top that with their awesome Parmesan cheese, some descent wine, maybe an orange fennel salad, and a David Bowie marathon for a meal that competes well against orgasms in the battle for human stimulation.  And then there is that amazing authentic Italian gelato shop next door to top it off. Damn. I'm surprised that in a red state, Republicans don't pass a law to shut down this type of place. Or maybe just prohibit them from selling alcohol in combination with such a stimulating environment like they do at strip clubs that do the full monty.

I really wish I could like Stoudemire's. It is named after probably my favorite basketball player ever: the power, the majesty that is Amare Stoudemire.   It is also an amazing location with an upscale decor that I was really digging. At least after two 24 oz. Stella's, when I started looking around at all the bizarre glowing arrows on the ceiling that make the place seem like a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired church. Perhaps a temple to Him, Black Jesus, who will finally deliver us Suns fans to the promised land.  It's just such a shame the food is so lackluster and expensive, the menu is so pitiful before games, the hours are so freakin stupid, and there are no happy hour or game day drink specials to get me warmed up for the passion and the pride I need to bring to a game.  If there were just a couple of fixes to the factors in that equation (preferably the quality of food and the presence of pre-game drink specials), it might become my venue of choice before a game. As it is, it's a useless restaurant that gets by on its location and name.   But as long as they keep packing them in before every Suns game, I guess they have no reason to stray from their product of offering a few over-priced entrees and drinks on short hours and laughing their way to the bank.

i would rate the food here at five stars, some of the best thai food i've ever had.  the problems are the atmosphere of the place. run down strip mall space with lime green and pink interior decoration from what i remember best left in the 80s.  as another reviewer said, they don't screw around with spice. if you ask for it very spicey you better watch yourself.

The turkey and brie is a five star sandwich for sure. However I've been up and down the menu since I come here about every other week and haven't been able to find anything else the compares or is worth the 9 dollar price tag and table service. The closest in quality for me is the pressed chicken, herb chicken, and vegi melt.  What cements the four star rating is the fact that this place might have THE WORST music ever in the history of eating establishments. It is typically a mix of musak and fake jazz that you normally only have to listen to at the dentist. In my trip today my table looked at each other in shock when "Believe It or Not" (the theme song to The Greatest American Hero) came on mixed in with this music. Even though I love this song, the experience of hearing it mixed in with the bathroom jazz somehow cemented its place in the pantheon of worst music experiences available in Arizona. Would it be that hard to put together a playlist of some real jazz or some good chill electro? I'll put it together for them if they want just so I don't have to suffer through my turkey and brie anymore.  But among the pluses are a great atmosphere otherwise, a patio, good iced tea, solid baked goods (if they have blondies when you go you have to get one), and the attached art gallery which is sometimes open at lunch time and serves as a great diversion from work. But overall it just makes me miss having Beyond Bread three times a week in Tucson.

"Hey everybody, let's go cram ourselves into a patio until we can't feel our extremities!"  "Ummm, that sounds awful, but maybe I'd save some money because I wouldn't be able to get to the bar."  "Save money! No don't worry, you won't do that either. You're pre-mixed margaritas and jack and cokes are going to be at least 8 bucks, so it's impossible to spend an hour cramped elbow to elbow with a bunch of douche bags without at least blowing a couple of sawbucks for no discernible reason!"  "Why in the hell would I spend 8 dollars on a lame pre-mixed margarita that tastes like Hi-C?"  "Because its pre-mixed and poured by authentic amateur weight lifters whose awesome margarita powers can't be contained in shirts with sleeves even on a 50 degree night!"  "Ummm, are there are at least some people in the kitchen who know how to make some decent Mexican food?"  "Who knows! With all the douche bags that take over the tables to play drinking games with soiled sugar packets, no one other then tourists actually orders food sober here!"  "No offense, I'd rather just get loaded at a Manuel's or something."  "Manuel's! You don't need to drive out to Manuel's when you have top-notch Scottsdale doorman that know all the best restaurants within 40 feet of Loco Patron like My Big Fat Greek to recommend to out-of-towners in case it's too busy in there to hear your children crying!"  "Shouldn't a doorman recommend something more authentic and regional to an out-of-towner obviously trying to do something native on their vacation?"  "What's more native to Scottsdale then shallow restaurants and people willing to pay anything to crowd together and feel important!"

i only wnt to burn on friday nights when they do their "french kiss" night with dj william "fucking" reed, but I would have to say this is the best indie night in phoenix alongside "shake" at rogue (which william "fucking" reed also hosts). the music at "french kiss" however has an electro-clash, electronica, and dance punk base whereas "shake" has an old school punk, post punk, and indie rock base. however, "french kiss" just moved to homme lounge.  the actual place itself is great. it is really huge with a huge dance room, a smaller semi-indoor room with a fireplace, and a patio with many tables where you can drink and smoke. the bar is absolutely massive which makes it easy to get a drink. the huge room also has many large booths where you can lounge and watch people dance. waiters come around to all the tables and will get drinks for you and put them on your tab. it has really awesome sound, lighting, and decor and usually really good djs on friday nights.  the bad things about the place are the fact that there is no beer on tap which always drives me crazy. it has a biazarre unisex bathroom where you walk in to where the sinks are and then either go left for ladies or right for guys.   also, they start a cover (even though it is usually a cheap 3 or 5 dollars) too early in my opinion. i have got there slightly after 10, when there is still only around 20 people there and they try to charge me a cover. really fucking stupid. this can lead to there being very few people there not much of a dance party. especially during the summer.

All of the excitement of eating at a cafeteria deli counter mixed with all the ambiance of visiting your great aunt at a Florida retirement home.   Get ready to enjoy cold cuts or chicken salad on cold bread with as little condiments or additions as possible for three times the price you would pay if you just went to Fry's and made it yourself.  Then plop yourself down and enjoy the louder then necessary ramblings of vintage Phoenicians at your choice of either the inside dining area that is somewhere between a Laughlin casino buffet dining area and a senior citizens hospital cafeteria; or the outside patio where you can soak in more lime green then is safely recomended by the FDA.  An Arizona tradition. For some reason.

Maybe the blandest and most unappetizing Mom and Pop Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.  I had the displeasure of trying this place once during lunch for work, and once for dinner before a Suns game. Both times they offered cheap combination platters that ran about 7 dollars for an entree, soup, fried rice, and egg roll. Everything from there I would probably rank a step or two below what you even get at a Panda Express.  The Ma po tofu dish I picked last time for dinner was particularly awful and bland. Some cheap store bought tofu lightly fried with some soy sauce. If it wasn't enough, I got somewhat sick off of it too. How do you poison someone with a tofu dish? I guess this place is good at sucking every way possible.  At least its cheap.

Excellent middle eastern food in a pretty sketchy, run-down location.   Almost a little too authentic for me. I though I was a big Baba Ghanoush fan until I ate here the other day. It was pretty weird consistency and had a very pungent flavor. I'm guessing this is how it supposed to be made. I'm not sure if I'm a Baba Ghanoush man anymore.  I had a vegetarian plate, which was very diverse, large, and tasty. I think it ran 8.50 and came with hummus, the aforementioned pungent baba ghanoush, dolmades, falafel, tabouli, spanakopita, pita bread, and soup or salad (I got the lentil soup). Everything was very flavorful and delicious, except for the dolmades which were surprisingly tame. The falafel which was perfectly crispy on the outside and warm, tasty, and chewy on the inside was a welcome change from the pedestrian falafel I've had recently at the big fat greek and cyprus pita grill.  My companion got the Arabic alliance certified mixed kebab platter. It looked awesome, but didn't blow my friend's mind. It had baba ghanoush, hummus, rice, a chicken kabob, and a beef kabob as well as pita and soup/salad.   The biggest issue with this place is its location. Seedy, old strip mall trying to class it up with a whole foods market, arab market, fattoush, etc. But that area is not the kind of place to walk around at night and the dining room at fattoush isn't much to look at. It's the kind of place you want to eat at and get out of as soon as possible. Hopefully in due time they will be able to move to a better location.  Although the staff is very friendly, seemed to be on a first name basis with most of the people who came in, and of course makes great food. I'd recommend it for lunch or take out when you are looking for a big, flavorful meal.

So I've been doing the Blockbuster Total Access thing for about a year now that gets you unlimited rentals in the mail, and now 5 in-store exchanges a month.  Just recently, I rented two Lost discs from the third season and kept them past Blockber's imaginary deadline when they decide to charge you for the price of what you have rented until you return it to them. I say imaginary because it seems to change from week to week. It used to take a month for this to happen, now it happened within a week of when they were rented.  That's cool, whatevs. Until I see the charge, 130 dollars!?!??! They fucking with me? Apparently, for each Lost disc I had out, they charged me for what an entire season costs. Even though they could still rent out the discs from the rest of the season, and both of the discs I had were from the same season. This is grossly irresponsible as a business.  This store is relatively clean and neat, but don't bother renting any older DVDs from it. You will be lucky if they have what you are looking for, and even if they do, it will be scratched to holy hell.  Some of the worker's have also given me attitude when I rent videos around their 10 pm or 11 pm closing time. Dudes, I used to work at a video store when they were all open to midnight every night. Deal with it. You're getting paid by the hour;.

bring your own booze! there wasn't any warning on yelp before i went. man, was that a disappointment.  otherwise this is a great place with good atmosphere, a friendly staff, and very good sushi. however, the prices are a little on the high side. sushi costs around 2-3 dollars more then most other places and the dishes there are in the 15-25 dollar variety.  it's a good place to try, but i can't justify going to it frequently with its prices.

Man, these things are EVERYWHERE now. WHY?!? Oh right, its the huge crowds of people who are apparently in love with movie-to-restaurant spin-offs. What the hell is going on in this city? Are these things this popular everywhere?  Pretty much everything I've ever had is about the blandest Greek food I've ever had at prices that make me sad. The only exception is the Greek fries which you can get as a side to a pita sandwich and will get you through a lunch here if you are coerced into going.  This location probably though should have a 3 star rating or so because of its great spot and huge patio by the waterfall action in Arizona Center which draws in large lunching business groups like I am all too frequently in. However, the below average/average Greek food you get here just makes me angry that a better, more unique restaurant isn't taking advantage of this space.

Really great new hangout downtown. Did an awesome job reimagining this place into a dark, seedy, yet very comfortable bar. Although two latinos who sat beside me were really upset to not find Big Al, pool tables, and karaoke night. Oh well, you can't please everybody.  I went after first friday and it was predictably packed. They had three bands that were extremely loud, but were thankfully also very good. The first band was a mixture of 70s surf music, hardcore, and generator rock that felt very in place for the bar as well as the city (the best band of the night). The other two were a hives rip off band and another surf music band that were also pretty good. But too loud to hold a decent conversation. I would prefer to go there on a night without bands to chill.  The other negatives are no patio and no beer on tap. But the drinks were a good price for a friday(G&T's for 3.50), well made, and pretty alcoholic.

I was summoned to this place by a coupon I received in the mail for a free coffee mug that I could get $1 refills any time i come back. (Those Money Mailer things aren't a complete waste some time).   I am glad I came because the breakfast panini I'm eating right now is all aces. I just picked up food, but I really liked the place. It seems like a great place to relax and I'm looking forward to going there for lunch sometime when I want to take an extended lunch break.  The only issues I had were the lack of real iced tea and the staff being completely out of practice in serving customers because the place is frickin dead. I'd encourage people to check this place out so that it doesn't go under.  Update - 9/22 - The iced tea machine has arrived and is open for business. (Thanks Tom) The place itself, still dead.

two words: disco floors.  you would think that those two words to be enough to warrant a five star rating. unfortunately, this place has had a lot of trouble attracting a crowd for its "faux show" friday nights when i've gone, ever since burn nightclub opened and started its "french kiss" night on friday. apparently phoenix has trouble supporting two indie-electro dance parties on the same night.  i've had many people try to convince me different, including the DJs themselves. but over the past year, i've rarely seen any crowd that rivaled the rawkus dance parties that were there before. and even if they do break out, its not until about 1 a.m. that it happens. i don't think it makes me old to demand that we get the party started earlier.  its a shame, because i've had a lot of fun at this place, despite the fact that it is just a tiny dive in a strip mall. did i mention it has disco floors?  it also has really cheap strong drinks and really good djs who i've found to be even better then those who play at "french kiss". it is a great place to go after you warm up at shady's for a while and want to show your moves.  however, it is just a dive with very little space, very little sitting if you wanna take a break during a dance party, very little space at the bar, tiny bathrooms, and no patio to drink at.  the lack of a patio is what gets me down the most. i love going out and dancing, but i like to take a break, cool off, drink, and conversate in a more chill environment between dance sessions. here, the only option you have is standing out front in a shady strip mall, sans beverage, starring at a food city across the street. buzzkill.  hopefully the indie crowd in phoenix will continue to grow to make "faux show" a larger success. but if you haven't ever been to this place, you have to check it out sometime on fridays and bask in the glow of its light-up floors.

Long live China Gate! If there was a mecca of Chinese food for me in Arizona, it was China Gate which was torn down in the construction of Metro Center to make way for a Petsmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, Subway, Blockbuster, and Starbucks. No joke.  It was finally resurrected in a strip mall (by another Starbucks) on the west side with a shorter menu and much better atmosphere then ever before. It is located in this satellite piece of the strip mall right at the corner of the intersection.   It is still a nice place to eat even though its in a strip mall because of some great interior design. Although the floorplan of the place is a little awkward with a bar area and dinning room with a big tv when you walk in and another dining area down the hall. They have the equipment to do karaoke in the front section on the tv, but I don't know if they ever actually do it unless you have a party there.  But the food is the best part. It is on the Americanized side but you are eating Chinese food in Phoenix, AZ. It's hard for me to get anything other then the Mongolian there which is incredible. Most people get it with Pork, but it is also awesome with their deep-fried tofu. They also have awesome spring rolls, but they aren't quite as good as they were when they were China Gate.  They have lunch specials still but they aren't as mind-boggling as they were at China Gate. At china gate, you got a full dinner plate, fried rice, soup, and an egg roll for 5.50. Now you get a slightly smaller sized main dish, rice, soup, a tiny salad with sesame dressing, and some wonton action for like 6.75.   But still overall, its one of the few great independent places on the west side along with Mike's Rigatoni Bistro and Touch of Thai.

this place absolutely sucks. probably the worst music venue i've ever had to watch a show in. it wouldn't be so bad if they just stuck to the local and small time bands that usually play there, but when bands with a good reputation and fan base have to play there it is a disaster.  the place itself is just strip mall space with the walls painted black and a bar stuck in the center. the sound there is absolutely terrible unless the band brings its own system. but even when ladytron did that, it was still really quiet. i think they must have some noise requirements since they are in a strip mall and right by homes. total suck.  if you wanna drink while you watch you have to stand at the back of the place behind or to the side of the bar which gives you a horrible view and even poorer sound. i was watching architecture from helsinki at one of the high tables at the back and i could barely hear them over people talking near me. embarrassing.  the bar prices are also lousy. around 5 dollars for a pint.  only go there unless you absolutely have to hear the band playing. if a band you care about announces a date there, make sure to try to contact their tour manager and try to convince them to play elsewhere. my recommendation would be the brickhouse.

I pretty much grew up at this Barro's Pizza, so this rating carries a bit of misty-eyed nostalgia for my days in Moon Valley, the best neighborhood in Phoenix. I have so many memories of going here on a Friday or Saturday night with the fam, playing its pathetic little play area and arcade, and watching the Suns. Or from getting a two slice lunch special while hanging out at the now defunct card shop that used to be in this strip mall.   But at the same time, Barro's makes some amazing non-deep-dish Chicago pizza at some of the cheapest prices in the city. Even grown up, there isn't much more satisfying meals then getting a Large mushroom and black olive for 10 bux with some beer and going to town. The wings and bread sticks are also always a good call as well as the white pizza that some Barro's locations serve.  Now I almost go into withdrawals on Friday nights with local sports and I don't get my Barro's, which is often because for some reason they never decided to open a location downtown. What gives??? How does a Phoenix OG like Barro's never open a location in the city center? They need to rectify that as soon as possible.

Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices. Actually, the first decent mom and pop restaurant serving an Asian cuisine I've been to downtown.  This place is a godsend from the over-priced likes of Wild Thaiger and Fate. It features really tasty and authentic lunch specials which run 6.95 and come with a small soup and a spring roll. I got a Pad Khing which was absolutely delicious and spicy. It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good.  I also really like the diner experience for a small lunch. The only downer is that if you go with more then four people you will likely be sat in this attached dining room which has an awkward company-sponsored-increase-teamwork-dinner vibe. Although it still has the groovy 70s brown and orange lamps that are throughout the restaurant, which are a highlight fo' sho'.  The thai iced tea rawked my world too. Milkier then usual, but delicious.

A really refreshing and great local tea shop that chose the wrong location.  Other people have already harped on it, but I just don't understand why the owner decided to situate probably what is the city's best tea bar in strip mall paradise. It was pretty busy when I went on a Saturday afternoon in the middle of the holiday shopping season.  But I'm guessing that during the week, when it could be registering foot-traffic in the hundreds if it was in the Biltmore or central corridor somewhere, it is struggling to make ends meet. Or maybe the college crowd is flocking there? I always stayed right by campus for my tea or coffee in college, so I'm guessing not. I'll stop talking about it.  The selection of the tea is pretty incredible and runs the full gamut of esoteric-tastes-like-dirty-sock varieties of tea to big crowd pleasers like the vanilla earl grey and kiwi melon. They have a very knowledgeable staff that can guide you through the menu and suggest tea drinks and seems well trained in how to make tea.  Although I'm not so sure about some of their methods. (This is where I turn into the picky tea snob, but that's what this store is for, right?) For one thing, when I decided to get a cup while I perused the menu for what bulk tea I wanted I was pretty shocked to find that the smallest cup is 16 oz. That is huge for a tea drinker like me who drinks the literal cup like a proper Englishman.   Next, for hot tea, they put it in a tea bag and steep it in a Styrofoam cup with a lid on it and tell you to let it steep for 3 minutes for my black tea. That seemed really short for a black tea, but I followed their instructions. Sure enough, it was a fairly weak giant cup of tea.  Add to that I had the flavor of the Styrofoam cup to augment my tea. I see that some people got a teapot and a glass cup? I wish that was me. I'll have to do that next time, but it's not really practical if I don't want a full pot. They should really invest in some small personal teapots.  Next, since my tea was weak I decided to throw in some Sugar in the Raw (props to that) and stirred it in with a wooden stirrer. The wooden stirrers must be ultra low grade because they really impacted the taste of the tea adversely. They have to go.  But the major reason for the star off is the bulk tea. The process of putting a bulk tea order of any size takes forever even with a group effort. Someone put in one while I was checking the menu and it took them like 20 minutes, which I had to wait through until I could do mine. Then I had to wait another 15 minutes for mine to be finished which made my quick trip to get some tea an our long. Almost made me miss the tip-off for the Suns game too.  They sell it by the gram, which was a culture shock to me. I asked what the translation was from grams to either ounces or teaspoons which they couldn't help me out with. They suggested 25 or 50 grams at least. I did such and hoped for the best.  And while the teas that I have tried so far have been very good, they aren't quite as good as from adagio.com (which they sell and use some teaware from) where I normally get my tea and are much more expensive. Especially when you factor in that they charge 2.50 if you want the bulk tea in a tin, otherwise it comes in a stapled bag.  As such, the bulk tea from there is only good when you decide to try a tea they have there for a change in pace. They aren't good as a primary supplier for a heavy tea drinker.

I made a b-line for the phoenix spectrum plaza as soon as I learned tonight that the Super Target . I was just there for some Vaseline Lip Therapy and some Halloween merchandise, but god do they have everything. And pretty damn good everything at that. The even have a round-a-bout to get to the place when you access it off of 19th ave. How slick is that?  The Halloween section was amazing. It a shame that a department store has taken over in terms of the best decorations in Arizona, but it has happened. I finally scored one of those sweet light up orange "Welcome" gate arches. It's been a long time coming. I also grabbed one of the other coolest decorations I have ever found: a black feather wreath. It is proudly hanging on my front door right now. It was the first thing I did when I got home (in spite of the fact that my house sweltered to somewhere around 90 degrees today with the air off). They also had a black roses wreath. It was a really fucking hard decision.  The Halloween candy section is also not to be missed. When I saw they had Tootsie packages of just the Flavor Rolls this place became holy ground for me. The only place I've seen those before was at Teaching Tools and that place closed down. I got 5 bags. Unfortunately they didn't have stand alone packs of Milky Way Midnights. Alas, I got a variety pack. (I hate variety packs. Such a waste of money and you always get crap you don't want.)  My only complaints were having to see (and worse hear) the new Matchbox 20 video when I walked through the entertainment section, which reminded me I was in a sanctum of corporate filth. I cleansed myself by putting on the new Liars in my car as soon as I got out of the store and taking a couple spins on the round-a-bout.   Also disappointing was the shopping cart I took from the front of the store, which despite the fact that I was in a brand new target and got a brand new cart, I still managed to pick one where one of the wheels was busted. I swear I must be cursed.  Also a shame was the fact they replaced the credit card readers that suck your card in while you complete the transaction with normal ones that you just slide your card through like everywhere else. I loved those credit card readers for some reason. I guess they decided that the card-sucking-action was cool but flagrantly unnecessary.  But all in all this place is good times. They had to kick me out at the 10pm closing hour to get rid of me.

Someone is really going to need to explain to me why there is a trend to long-sprawling outdoor malls with only one level and all the stores facing inward. I park at one end of "The District" and have to walk what seems like 3/4 of a mile or so to the other end to see all the stores, only to find that my choices are now to walk back past the same 3/4 miles of stores or walk alongside the brickwall backs of said stores.  Other then Tea Infusion, the Harkins theatre, Dave and Buster's, and maybe the Chipotle I don't think there is any establishment I would frequent in said "District". Not even an Express or French Connection or some clothing store that I might shop at. Why not just go to Fashion Square/old town Scottsdale?  BevMo is the only place I found in stores outside the District that I couldn't already just go to at Camelback Colonnade or any mall I've ever visited in my life.   They had a great opportunity to build something interesting and of value to the growing professional Tempe community after Cardinals Stadium pulled out, but really, really wasted this space. Except when Girl Talk played in the parking lot.

This place is pretty much just getting by on its close proximity to hoards of Grand Avenue crackheads.   My co-workers who live on Roosevelt and I have been dying to try this place for a long time since we drive by it every day, but have lacked the kahones to make it happen. Its sign and front display which advertise every un-healthy dining option imaginable always cracks our shit up. It has a big sign that says "Valley Pizza" but then also advertises "Fish n' Chips", "Gyros", "Philly's", "Subs", "Wings", "Calzones", and two more I think.  Me and two brave co-workers finally gathered the courage to go and rolled in next to a really pimp bright red Caddy. We thought this might be the sign of great things to come. We got in and were pleasantly surprised by how well maintained it was and how cheap the prices were, but not about how hot it was inside. Old building comprised of a boxing gym, Valley Pizza, and a liquor store; not insulated or air conditioned well. Even on a 85 degree day it was pretty hot inside.  I ordered a small "Thick Chicago" pizza with mushrooms and black olives and tried to pay with a credit card. He told me to go next door to the liquor store which is owned by the same guy to pay with a card.   I went next-door which was ultra-sketchy and also seems to cater largely to crackheads. It was significantly dirtier, less maintained, and claustrophobic. However my friend, who is from the South, was extremely impressed to find they offered some alcoholic beverage, which I'm guessing is a type of malt liquor, called Cisco that brought him back to his North Carolina days.   I charged my credit card and thought I was done. "Not so fast amigo." They gave me cash, that's right, they gave me cash in the amount that I had charged to go back to pay the guy in Valley Pizza. Rather then engaging in a debate about how a credit charge is not worth the same as cash or why they don't just reconcile payments at the end of the day with the two clerks who seemed to be way too fucked up to hold an intelligent conversation with, I took my cash and went back next door.  After a decent wait we got our food: my pizza, a huge meatball sandwich, and a gyro pita w/ fries. It was pretty much cafeteria quality food. My meatball sandwich friend and I were disappointed in the tomato sauce along with pretty much all the other ingredients. And my pizza was neither "Thick" nor "Chicago" style, more Peter Piper classic then anything. My friend who got the gyro said it was actually pretty good though. Overall the food was fresh and at an edible quality, but like I said, clearly intended for someone with a 2pm buzz and a dime-bag budget.

Awesome counter-service Italian sandwich, calzone, pasta, and pizza place open only for lunch during the week. New York transplant with great ingredients and recipes.  They have a huge menu of the aforementioned menu items that cater to vegetarian and meat eaters. The prices are very reasonable (around $7) when considering the quality of food, the ingredients, and the ambitious serving sizes. Calzones and pizzas are monstrous and the foccacia sandwiches aren't a slouch either. Sandwiches aren't as good as Cibo, but are a very good alternative for the price and a quicker meal.  However, the huge menu is also it's downfall. While exploring it I have found several pretty bland menu items that don't belong. Some of the turkey and vegetarian sandwiches I have tried have been sub-par. People I've been with have also had some mediocre experiences with their pastas o' the day.  I also visit it far less then I normally would because they won't serve you free water. You have to buy a bottle. Isn't that illegal?

BACON SAUCE!!!!!   It's mention in the menu peaked my curiosity and honestly tasted good for a couple of bites. But by the end of the brioche I started feeling pretty queezy from the hog fat overload. And I can't help but feel a little out of sorts when I think about Over Easy since. The brioche was also pretty frickin tiny for being on their "entree" menu. Maybe bacon sauce is elsewhere without my knowledge, but it seems like a bizarre and gratuitous invention that should be avoided unless you're are heavily intoxicated.  So why do I still go four stars on this place? Probably the time and care put into everything they bring out to you. The menu is ambitious, so I guess they do have time to concentrate, but there is just something to a perfectly made hearty pancake from the right ingredients.  So  I guess this is where you come for no-nonsense breakfast food made perfectly, but as said before, the prices just don't make a lot of sense when you have to keep ordering things a la carte to work off that hangover. Although maybe not as stupid as their 1130 a.m. closing time, even on weekends when hoards of people are still driving up and trying to get a table at noon.

"They've got PBR on tap!!!" Damn, I had no idea it was that easy to please my Scottsdale friend who apparently likes going low class as much as a bulimic Portland hipster.  "We've gotta hang out more often if thats all it takes for you to have a good time," I told him. "What's it called?"  "Something with Max. Max's Revenge. The maxx. Total Max. MAX POWER."  "MAX POWER."  "Yeah, MAX POWER. Let's do it. They've got PBR on tap!!!"  As well as pretty much everything that goes with PBR. 4 dollar lunch specials with a beer, poker tournaments, internet poker dealies, casino style seating, and of course MULLETS! It was such a mullet fest I couldn't stop laughing in spite of all the assanine Patriots fans making sports observations that make Dan Dierdorf look like a Rhodes Scholar. And the tuck rule?!? We really gotta bring up the tuck rule? It was the sixth anniversary of those divisional playoffs and all, but please spare me the pain while I'm trying to enjoy the post-season despite another 4-12 Raiders finish.  I'm off track. Back to the mullets. I first noticed it when a couple, dressed in what is likely their Saturday night best leather, took over one of the pool tables. As the female partner flashed her curly, blond locks during shots, I commented at how I guess the good part of having a girlfriend with a mullet is you can take her to a sports bar on a Saturday night for some free pool and poker and she will think that they are royalty.  But surely mullets and PBR don't equal four stars Mike, is what you are likely saying. It doesn't. It's the huge fleet of HD flat screens that really make this place. They really do multiple-game viewing right at this place with all large flat screen TVs lining the walls and plenty of comfortable seats in the center to watch them from.   They also have a huge selection of draft beers the runs almost the entire length of their bar. Domestic 25 oz beers ran around 4 dollars. "They've got PBR!!!" Alright Jason, I get it, but I'll have a Stella. Those ran 7 dollars for the 25 oz variety.  Top it off with all the free pool and ping pong you can co-ordiante yourself through after 25 oz beers and some mixed NFL playoffs/Phoenix Suns action.   "We really should've played ping pong before all that booze," I said breaking out in a sweat chasing after about my 30th errand ball.  "Agreed."

I was slightly disappointed with my Magic Mushroom Burger when I just finally tried Two Hippies' flagship burger after reading about the sober, blown minds of other Yelpers. But as I got more into the "special" sauce (probably shouldn't ask any questions about it), reveled in the quality ingredients, and remembered that I just paid 5 dollars event for a large burger, giant sack of fries, and can of sod-e pop I started falling in love with the place.  It and the whole strip of stores there have a definite time warp effect if you are there around lunch time. The kooky yet wholesome collection of stores, mix of intentional and unintentional nostalgic decor, genuinely friendly store owners, and time-is-not-of-the-essence attitude of the patrons throw me back to my feel-good childhood going to pizza parlors and mom and pop stores in Moon Valley. It has a near perfect blend of Americana in the stores there: Burger Shack, Barber Shop, Pizza Parlor, Head Shop, Motorcycle Repair, and the soon-to-be New Orleans Coffee and Balloons(???). (Well maybe I'll have to hold off judgment until that last establishment finally opens, but you can bet I'll be there on opening day to figure out what the hell coffee, balloons, and New Orleans have to do with each other in the same shop.)  Two Hippies seems to be run by an actual Mom and Pop who are actually interested in learning the name and story of everyone who walks in and making sure they had a good meal. Meals then come in sack form and are difficultly eaten on dense collections of bar stools inside or outside next to a bar that is too high even for a tall guy like me to eat from. But the whole action of kicking it on a patio bar stool while eating a burger mid-air out of a wrapper just adds to the feel and will eventually evoke a Jules Winnfield impersonation, quoting, "Uummmm, that's a tasty burger!"  I feel like now have our "Big Kahuna" burger establishment in central Phoenix. It's not as refined and awesome as Delux or Fez, or as high quality as Welcome Diner, but its an overdue innovation for a quick, cheap sack lunch.  But keep in mind the area still can be pretty seedy even at lunch time. There is quite a few homeless people roaming around at all times, usually including the war veteran guy in a wheelchair with only a few teeth left that likes to wear wife beaters and direct traffic. I also got to hear a long and drawn out "bitch needs to gimme ma money" conversation when I was eating on the patio.  My only other complaint is that part of their decorations is a vintage cabinet Ms. Pac-Man machine that is supposedly in working order that they are just using as a table to hold flavored candy sticks and other crap. It's a travesty. They need to fire that baby up.
