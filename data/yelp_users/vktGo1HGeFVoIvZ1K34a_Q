I feel bad giving them 2 stars, the first time I went I LOVED the bbq, so good, so tender.  Second time I went, same thing, BUT I got food poisoning!  A busy, well known place like that shouldn't have that happen.  I'm never eating there again.

I come here whenever I'm baking something special.  They usually have whatever it is I'm looking for.  If not, it usually can't be found anywhere else either.  I also took one of the classes, GREAT instructors, totally worth the money I spent on supplies.  The staff is always friendly.  The rows are kind of small so if the place is packed it can get awkward, but they're jam packed with stuff so it can't be helped.  Do be careful in the entrance/parking area, it can get a little congested and not everyone pays attention.  Wish there was one closer to me. :)

When I first got my puppy she was matted and had a string tied around her tail (whoever had her before had tried to crop it at home, I rescued her). Crystal has taken extra special care of my little girl from day one! My dog loves going to her, she gets so excited to see her. My pup always looks adorable when she comes back home! I always get very detailed report cards from Crystal, which means she's paying attention to my pup's needs. I discuss what's going on with my dog before the groom and Crystal makes awesome suggestions regarding whatever needs my dog has (i.e.. more conditioning in the winter, shorter cut in the summer, even which type of glucose she suggests). I send all my friends with animals to her, and now I'm doing the same with you! Hope your pets are happy and shiny!

My pet and I love the staff here. We've been going since before they moved. They are always good about explaining exactly what is going on and all the options for taking care of it. They are very concerned with how the pets are, they even called after her surgery a couple different times to check up on my dog! My pup loves them because she gets treats and affection from everyone she sees.   That being said, the new local has horrible parking. The a/c isn't as effective as it should be so it can get kind of uncomfortable if you have a long visit in the room facing the sun in the summer. And the last time I was in was the first time I ever felt like they were trying to sell me stuff I wasn't sure if I needed yet. I'm wondering if they are having some financial hardships? I will continue to go there because  we've been to other vets and this is the best my pup has been cared for. The good defiantly outweighs the bad!

Beautiful shop! Smells awesome! Friendly staff. Good selection. Female smokers are extra appreciated there as well, which was a nice bonus.

I started going here a while back, before the other locations were opening up. I've gotten pierced and re pierced here. They have a great staff, knowledgeable and considerate. Good jewelry selection. CLEAN! Which is always a must. This is where I tell people to go, for lots of reasons.

I went here because I had a discount coupon from one of those daily special type sites. Everyone there was pleasant, the decor was nice. That being said, my brows were shaped very square and pointy, not really a normal shape, and to top it off the wax er left me with a long red abrasion on one of my eyes that lasted for over a week. I won't be going back.

Staff was amazing! Very friendly and helpful.  Good deals if they have the stuff you like.  If they don't you can always ask them to get it.  :)

I buy a few groupons for this place every time they offer them!  The food is awesome!  Prices are good on somethings, little high on others, that's why I use the groupons when I can.  Small shop though, if you are there at an off time or doing take out would be easier.  But worth the time it takes to pick it up!

I LOVE this place!  The selection of both cigars and alcohol is great!  The decore is relaxing, and most of all it is female friendly.  :)  Every staff member I came across was pleasant and helpful.  If you've got time to spend there relaxing, I would do it.  It is not close to me and I still go every chance I get.

I had food delivered. The man on the phone was nice, but barley understood me. The food was bland. sauce was runny. Lots of food, but not worth the money.

The food here was great! Wish there was more indoor seating, but the seating both indoor and outside is nice, live music sometimes, nice decor.  I've tried a few of the specialty drinks, some are good some are so/so but isn't it always that way? Just preferences.  The prices are a bit high, but the portions are worth it, we can split a meal typically.  The Deserts are awesome too!

I'm not surprised this place is closing.  The staff was abrasive, the clothing was over priced, even on sale.

I was stoked to find a supposedly good nail place close to home. I've been there a few times trying different services (pedicures, manicures, gel overlay). I'm all about giving places a chance. I've had ONE technician do an awesome job, I managed to get her a couple times, one time she was booked so I tried someone else, this girl did a horrible job and left me with misshaped gel on my nails because she took too much gel off the top, the lack of gel also left my nails in a weaker state then before so they chipped and broke. The last pedicure I got there the woman spent more time talking to the lady next to me then me and left scrub and other goo on my legs. I'm past not impressed. For the same price I can drive a little farther to get my nails done, and get lunch too.

Julia ROCKS!! I had gave her more parameters then instructions and she made my hair look AWESOME!! The decor is cool to look at while you're being colored, cut, blown dry or whatever. They don't push product on you. They have a wide range of client types and accommodate all of them. Everyone was up beat and happy (a few back handed 'joke' type comments from one of the assistants, but it takes all kinds right?) I'm totally going back, and telling friends.

I got a groupon for here and tried a whole bunch of different flavors.  ALL AMAZING.  These are worth the price!  All the people I dealt with were very friendly.  This is my idea of a great bakery.  :)

I love going to this event! It's relaxing yet invigorating.  It's nice to be able to get a little loud and rowdy, and then be able to go back to your indoor voice.  I saw every bout last season, I am going to try this year too!  I've gotten all my friends into going as well!

Let me just clarify, I am not a fan of Starbucks there coffee is bitter, and way too much work to order early in the am. If you are, this may or may not help you.   I LOVE Dutch Bros!  Coffee is yummy and still gives me a kick. Prices are good, sign up for the occasional text msg to get additional deals, but if you forget what they are the baristas will tell you and give you the deal, they have punch cards which are way more simple the the card/balence/reload thing at SB. Baristas are FAST there may be a line of cars but I've never waited more the 5 min. Baristas are pleasant, they have good memories, and are all friggin' pretty (males and females) what better way to wake up in the morning! AND they are the exactly the same other times of day, I have odd days off and the experience is always the same. There is a reason the tip jar is always full. :)

I had some old jewelry I decided to sell.  Went here first, and then a few other places. Considered selling it privately, that was going to take more time then I wanted.  I got the best offer and the most honesty about the process and prices with SW Jewelry.  I  trust them and will go back again when/if I need to.

The first time I went to this showi was  expecting something else, but I did enjoy myself anyway. The MCs are always funny. The acts are amazing. Great acrobatics, great dancers, good themes. They do move around a bit, I hope they find a permanent home. And it is definitely not what I would call typical burlesque. But who needs typical all the time? Great artistic performances!

The staff was pleasant and friendly. I liked the finished product. Those are the good things I have to say, now on to the other stuff. The decore was very cool, however dirty white sofas kinda grossed me out. Then soaking my feet in a bucket of room temp water was not ideal. I felt really awkward putting my feet directly on the 'technicians' knees as she sat on a stool in front of me, while I sat on a sofa. She mentioned product that she forgot to try and sell me at the end. I like the idea of a spa that is plus size friendly, but I think they should have waited until the could afford the proper equipment before offering so many services. I shiver thinking where the tattoo artist was supposed to work??

This is a fun event! It only happens once every few months so it's ok to be a little decadent on one night. So I like to get gussied up, have drinks, laugh at good comedy and enjoy the expression of art! For those of you turned off by the idea of nudity, most of the evening everyone on stage is clothed, the third act you get to see pasties. So, you could ideally go for just the first two segments. I stay for the whole thing. Cool vendors to shop between shows. They even do charitable donations for good causes. Buy your tickets early though, they are getting more popular every day. :)

The cupcakes are not good.  I've had cake mix from a box that tasted better.  Not worth the price at all.  The gal who took my order (the owner I think ) was very nice and very helpful.  The gal who delivered the order was rude, and had no information when I asked her a simple question regarding my order.  It's worth the drive to go elsewhere.

I called first to make sure they had what I needed, because I am aware that the stores inside JC Pennys don't have the exact same stock, because they are smaller.  Kayla was the staff member I got on the phone and she was very helpful.  She was happy to go back and forth a few times checking for products as we spoke, because I changed my mind due to her knowledge and the information she was giving me.  When I got to the store Bianca helped me and she too was knowledgeable and helpful. Even volunteered to re swatch me to make sure the color was right.  I would absolutely go here again.

Because this Sephora is inside a JCPenny and not a freestanding store they have a smaller selection, not all the colors or brands as a regular Sephora, but that is to be expected.  The staff for the most part is friendly and helpful.  I was given incorrect information by one of the staff over the phone, which I understand happens, and was given a very rude reception by the Manager when I explained the situation at the location.  She became defensive very quickly insinuating that I was either lying or did not give the staff the pertinent information when I spoke with them, both of which were inaccurate and I tried to explain to her, none of which she was hearing.  I did not expect them to break any rules or policies, which I think is what she was assuming I wanted from her reaction, but her response was neither professional or necessary.  Taking the time to understand the situation, even when she thinks the customer may be wrong, is what should have been her goal, that's what good customer service is about.  The store was not busy, there were no lines, she did not have something more important then the customer at that point, I was not rude to her initially, there was no reason why she should have behaved the way she did, and because of if she's lost a customer.  VIB Rouge btw. I would recommend going to one of the other locations.
