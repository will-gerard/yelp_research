Awesome place to go for very flavorful Itallian at a very reasonable price. The rusticas are unique and tasty; I recommend the eggplant. The brushetta is also a great way to try many flavors in one order by picking 4 different kinds. Service is always good and it's an easy place for takeout as well.

Amazing pancakes! I don't know if they are the best ever but I know that I've never had any that were definitely better. So good. The Mexicana Omelette is my usual. Lots of flavor and pretty original. You can make that meal last all day and it's surprisingly very reasonable in price considering the zip code. Great service too. Nothing bad at all to say.

Poor Business  I purchased a $5 off certificate from restaurant.com to try this place out. I used their online orsering system which was highly convenience since I work in the area and need it ready quickly. When I got there,  they said they were no longer accepting those coupons. Restaurants.com coupons NEVER expire; refusing them is a contractual violation. Plus, they are arguing over 5 freaking dollars and upsetting a new customer. They wouldn't budge on the discount so I did not take the food. So now they lost a potential repeat customer, wasted food and lost out on the money I would have paid for the meal. That's an INCREDIBLY STUPID business decision. So, I have no idea how good the food is and I will never find out.
