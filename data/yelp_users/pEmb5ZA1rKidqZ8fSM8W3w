I love all the girls who work here, Krissy is my beautician, she is the best!  I always make her cut my hair how she thinks it should look, I have yet to be disappointed! I would recommend anyone to her!

There is not a single brewery that beats Four Peaks food.  Their Pumpkin Porter is the greatest beer ever created in all the lands of the earth, and their Oatmeal Stout BBQ sauces kicks even Chuck Noris's ass.    Oh yeah, their artichoke dip is amazing too - the only thing i wasn't a fan of was their white sauce pizza....but hey, they're normal pizza is amazing so it's all good and that's only my opinion, maybe it'll be a vacation in your mouth....

These guys are crooks and deceiving liars. Do not go here! I went in today to get a quote of brakes, they broke my window and claimed it just fell after shutting my door, then they added about ten other things to the quote, one of the things being my rear shocks leaking, and have the quote telling me it would be for the original same shocks that on our the truck, these guys do not even know their vehicles. He quoted me for the bottom of the line shock, knowing my truck comes standard with bilstein shocks. They would not listen to me when I said "no" put my vehicle back together and I am leaving. Continued on and on with ridiculous prices. Do not go here!  They are scum of the scum.  You can know that I will never come back.

Why Have I not rated this place yet?  Probably because I don't want it to get any more people in front of me in line to get some of the best espresso served in Phoenix.  Lux is amazing, no joke without this place I wouldn't of graduated from college.  They hours of operation is incredible, allowing students to crack down on their papers before their deadlines.  The range in menu is pure bliss.  From coffee to alcohol all the way to muffins to Steak dinners, if there isn't one thing on the menu you don't want, it's because you probably want it all.  It's sincerely my home away from home.  I'm there practically everyday.

Scramble is something that North Phoenix has always needed.  It's been there for a while now, and I love the experience each and every time I step into the location.  The branding and Scramble image makes the experience fun and enjoyable.  With a cleaver crossword puzzle with words solely relating to eggs, philosophical "scramlism", and wise-lifestyle changing statements such as, "think global, eat local."...that is only the beginning.  This local breakfast joint has a great selection of food, from oatmeal...all the way to their Southwest breakfast burritos, to be honest you can't go wrong getting anything.  They even has coffee and full-leaf teas which are incredibly delicious.    As a North Phoenix born and raised and very familiar with the area...I'd say this place is a winner.

Cartel is impeccable to say the very least.  Cartel Coffee Lab, has it all.  The vibe was very relaxing, the baristas knew their stuff, and the coffee quality was unbelievably good.  I haven't had the entire menu, but if it is as good as their pastries, then my goodness they are onto something.  I have only been there a few times, with the way things are going, it is possible I be coming on a regular basis.  The staff/customer interaction i have seen is awesome.  As an ex-Starbucks barista, that was the goal I had, enriching people's lives one cup at a time, and that is indeed what I have seen from them.  The only thing I would improve is adding a few more comfortable pieces of furniture, other than that the d√©cor is great, with a simplistic/trendy look appeals pretty industrial.  The branding is fantastic, I'm telling you, it's everything you can ask for in a coffee shop...excuse me, coffee lab. Kudos to you guys, keep up the hard work as you maintain making it look easy.

Ummm why haven't I already rated this place??  New City is the absolute best!  I grew up going to a huge mega church my entire life.  Three years ago I decided it was my time to find a new home church.  I checked out a couple of friends churches...eh, not my fit. Then was told by like four friends within a week about this new church called New City.  I checked it out and felt right at home from the very first step when I walked in.   Now a lot has changed at New City - the growth has been incredible and there aren't free doughnuts - BUT they preach the word straight up, the worship is incentive, the community is AMAZING.  New City is everything you need in a church. The location is super great too!  You get fed, there's fruit, there is fellowship and I fit in!  Plus they have Lux Coffee in the lobby if that isn't the best bonus!  If you're looking for a bible believing church that is genuine and real. Check out New City!

I will put the time to fully explain why this place is way too cool for it's own good. But for now, just understand that it's amazing.  If you don't believe, check it out for yourself, go on a monday or tuesday and get their 2 pitcher / 1 pizza combo for $20 and the mouth dropping experience will begin.
