I love mariscos, but i didnt love San Carlos Bay. To be fair, they are known for their caldos and I just ordered filete veracruzana....but still!!! my dining companion got the fish tacos, standard to be sure, but really below standard. We are regulars at Playa Hermosa, so we decided to try out San Carlos Bay, I wont waste you time on a comparison, just know that all my dislikes about San Carlos Bay do not exist at Playa Hermosa. Service was decent, food just ok, and unless you are over 60 and white - you may stand out. Avoid this establishment and head around the corner for a better atmosphere, way better food and a decent ROA.

really really great!!! yep that sums it up!!! they remember who you are, the prices are reasonable and the quality of the work is very very good - they do alterations too! I had a love affair with bell cleaners for quite a long time and while they are great also, their prices just got to be too much!! so without sacrificing quality, i found thomas cleaners. yes they are not as pretentious as bell cleaners, no fancy coffee machine, fake flowers in the waiting room, but when I get my perfectly pressed, perfectly cleaned clothes home and I still have $ in my pocket, none of that matters!

We went to Baker nursery on Sunday...I had a lot of questions and we needed quite a few things for the yard. I was very impressed! A very friendly and super knowledgeable lady named Bonnie helped us. She was patient and explained things and answered my million questions! She was honest and made suggestions to help me save some $ while still getting the look i wanted - this was muy bueno!! We left about 30 min later with all of my questions answered and lots of supplies. Thanks Bonnie & we will def be going back to Baker Nursery!!

So - no one likes the dentist....I do!! I love my pearly whites and want to keep them that way!! I was referred to Dr Goodwin about 5 years ago & have been a happy customer ever since.  First off, the front desk...the ladies are great: friendly, professional, helpful. I never have to wait...I love that!!! (thanks kathy & karen) Second the hygenists: I go to Tammy and she is great - we have great conversation (yes even with her hands in my mouth!) and she is super fast. Third, Dr Goodwin: Yea he's great too! Friendly, funny and great with your mouth - he's filled cavities, fixed a broken venneer and of course regular checkups. He is precise and doesnt quit until everything is perfect - very important when it comes to my mouth! When he was fixing my broken veneer (I was hysterical!!!) he was meticulous and resculpted several times until it was perfect  - I wouldve wild-out if i left with less than perfect teeth, but luckily that was not the case!! Now the whole fam uses him and they love him too....

I needed blinds for the new casa - I called Ambassasor Blinds after reading a Yelp review, Joe Del came out the next day, free of charge to look at my windows. Joe asked alot of questions and really got to know my taste and style and vision for the house - he recommended cordless blinds and i decided to give it a whirl. After the blinds came in, Alfredo came out and installed them - he was very pleasant, needed no babysitting :) and installed all the blinds quickly. My boyfriend and I love the way the blinds look and work but we also love the service we got - Joe even stoped by after the install just to check on us and see how we were doing! As soon as our office is done, we will be calling Joe and Alfredo for more blinds!!

Just checked in - regardless of the service I will not be coming back here again! My husband came here for a dry eye issue after I found dr yanik on Yelp - he was great & my husband was happy. I try to make an appointment for a yearly exam & am told it's an extra $50 for a contact prescription, by an optician that is  'separate' from the doctors & she only takes cash! Sounds shady - let me add that I've been wearing contacts for 30 years!! Then they tell me, well you can just get the prescription & take it somewhere else to be filled. Fine. Now I'm here checking in & the oh-so-rude chick that checks me in says its $40 extra to get a script for glasses!! & then I have to pay the $50 in cash to get a contact script as well - she also adds that insurance doesn't cover the 'refraction fee' & so I have to sign some addl paperwork to agree to pay the fee.  BEWARE!! I think this is super shady & unnecessary - obviously I can & will choose a doctor that offers better services with a transparent fee plan.

this review has been a long-time coming & i apologize bcuz for all my blind peeps out there Lesco is just what you need!!!  First let me say that I have been going to Lesco (phoenix & tucson) for 10+ years....  Second & most important - frames are $29!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  hello people!!! $29!!!  way cheaper than your eye doctor - forget crappy walmart and other discount stores - head to LESCO.  they have a lot of frames (knock-offs & super trendy) & sunglasses too (i think sunglasses are a bit more, but i cant remember) it is $10  more for bi-focals.... and apparently if you are really blind like my sis-in-law then there is an extra charge for supper thick coke bottle lenses, only $10 i think.  So here are the details....no insurance accepted just $29, no tax either its just $29, they dont do eye exams so you have to have a prescription (but they will call your dr if you dont have it with you), the service is always amazing & they will adjust your glasses for free as many times as you need (did i mention im clumsy?) Best part - you can bring your fave sunglasses and they will put in prescription lenses for you also!! (i had them do it on a pair of armanis for me = gorgeous & functional!!!)  so bottom line - im a diva on a budget (ok except the jimmy choo's...) and thats why i love Lesco - you will too!!

Quite possibly the worst customer service at the pharmacy I have EVER received!!! I switched from Walgreens to CVS bcuz CVS is no longer selling cigs - so reward them for corporate responsibility....but this location makes it hard.  I usually deal with the cityscape location & they r much much better!! This location thrives on rudeness & stank attitude.  When I have to deal with them I cringe, I may be back to Walgreens **sigh**

ahhhh i love getting to pick the restaurant!!! no Out-back or Chili's when I pick, i think my team secretly likes that i am foodie who hates chain restaurants....(although they never admit it!!) I chose peruvian, i love peruvian and inka heritage did not disappoint. its off the beaten path in Madison (behind the capital) -  we went on a Tuesday night, needless to we were seated immediately (there were only 2 other parties).  the hostess was also the only server & she made all the drinks, so this made for a slow eating experience esp when more people arrived... I could not decide what to order (typical!) so i ordered a couple appetizers for a meal - the tamal...AMAZING!!! my fave - full of spices and even a hard-boiled egg, the yucca....a classic that I love!!, and an avocado filled with chx salad (the reina - i think)... typical, good but def not the tamal!! my dining companions both ordered the lamb - which was super tender and the flavor left you wanting for more! we also ordered wine and some cocktails... overall very very delicious and a cute little gem in madison!

had a nice family dinner here staurday night - it was delicious! our server was very helpful & nice, she suggested several menu items & they were spot on- we started with the plaintain avocado spring rolls & some patties. the spring rolls were ok - not enough flavor for me. we ordered a spinach pattie and a fish pattie. the fish pattie was amazing - the fish was spicy and the pattiy crust flavorful & flaky. the spinach pattie, was hearty and the flavor was decent, but def not as good as the fish pattie. we ordered 3 entrees: jerk shrimp, jerk chicken, & curried lamb. the jerk shrimp was spicy & perfectly cooked!!! i loved it - the jerk chicken was flavorful, but the shrimp was better, more heat etc... the curried lamb was off the chain!! i mean soooo good- melt in your mouth tender, great flavor. served with 1/2 acorn squah stuffed with sauteed greens. its was a great mix of flavors and textures!!! for dessert we had blue mountain coffee, which was served with coconut cream (unsweetened) - nice touch! and the sweet potato (& ginger?) pudd'n. the pudd'n had a good flavor, full of raisins, but was a little dry, the a la mode was prob the way to go as the extra liquid wouldve help the dessert. overall - 4 stars - very cute inside, super small, but not overcrowded. cant wait to go back!!!

what can i say...we are fans!!! i am addicted to the Cucumber Refresher, i think it is honey lemonade with cucumber (& possibly crack, the way you will crave it!!). it is truly refreshing & reminds me of the fruity refreshing afternoon drinks that are served in SE asia & indonesia (bali, thailand, vietnam...) i am a sucker for the kale salad:simple, filling, tangy, delish!! but the best item i think they have is the bison burger!!! WOW!! hands down the BEST burger in phoenix, juicy, always cooked to perfection, the flavors dance together in your mouth and you will want more!  initially i thought it would be kind of gamey, and never measure up to the likes of delux, the grind, maizie's, rocket burger, chelsea's kitchen and others, but amazingly i was blown away & it is a weekly staple for my man! desserts are also fresh, innovative & tantalizing. i have been eyeballing their brunch menu & am looking forward to trying it soon - overall - GO you will love it!

I bought a house downtown, built in 1939, great deal....NO A/C!!! I dont know much about A/C so of course I checked Yelp for recommendations...enter Miguel and Flores Air Conditioning. I had already gotten a quote from my contractor before I contacted Miguel. Miguel met me at the house that day and gave me a quote that was less than my contractor's quote for a better (trane) unit and also told me about the tax rebate that I could qualify for. Miguel re-ducted (is that a word?!) the entire house, installed the new unit, a great touch screen thermostat and new vent covers in just over a day! I am very happy and Miguel was great, he also referred me to a great electrician. 5 stars for great service, product knowledge, and working with a slightly demanding and difficult :) home owner!! Thanks Yelp for another great find!!!

This is a neighborhood gem!! We love it & eat here frequently!!  The other night I ordered the Vovo special - it was 'portugese surf n turf' (a steak, shrimp & rice) but dont let the simplicity of the dish fool you!! the sauce was heavenly - a demi-glace but better!! we also had the grilled brie sammies for a starter and...well they have brie in them - enough said -yum!!  We love that they make all their drink mixers - housemade sodas, it really makes the drinks extra special and delicious. The staff is always fun and friendly... GO!! you will love it!! PS- the savory cupcakes....the BEST (but they sell out quickly!!)

Ive been to giant several times now and I am a fan!!! I went this morning and took my man - he loved it!! The simplicity of the space (recycled and modern) is the perfect combination for me to work or enjoy a morning drink. The coffee is delicious, some of the best in the valley, and I like that they have a variety of delish items to nosh on...my only complaint about the food is that the burritos are made in the am and served throughout the day, so there is no opportunity to 'alter' them, I would like egg whites please! Lastly, Giant has consistently had great service, I am happy to say that it is lacking the pretentious attitude that much of the downtown coffee scene exhibits. Overall, a shining star among the downtown coffee houses.

i was at a conference last week at the pointe squaw peak and we saw this cute little eatery & decided to give it a try! I was very pleased!! i went there with some colleagues and we all ordered different things - the service was great, very quick & the server was on top of things! (funny too!!) i ordered the lunch special - salad & pasta - the salad was crisp & fresh with golden raisins and a great dressing. the pasta was perfectly al dente with a pink sauce & sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts & olives.... my co-workers were pleased also - the pasta rustico was filling and loaded with chicken, the meatball subs were just the right size on great bread with lots o meat & the caprese salad is served with pistachios!! yum!! babbo is well priced (lunch specials are $9) and a quick bite of good (if fairly traditional) pseudo-italian eats! cant wait to go again :)

i decided to try this nail shop after reading Leslie's review. i had been going to dv nails, and everything was fine, but was tempted to try something closer to home...there are a lot of nail shops in my area so the review really helped, anyways....i gave it a whirl & LOVED it!! i called ahead for an appointment, but got there early & they got me right in. the extra salt scrub was included in the pedi price!! as was a free eyebrow wax, since i had a mani & pedi! i added an upperlip wax & the total before tip was only $34!!! wow!!!  now a word about the accomodations - CLEAN!!! everything was spotless and the nail tech was very accomdating. all of the pedi chairs are brand new and very comfortable. Anne, the owner, did my waxing and even filled in my brows with pencil when she was done. i was a little nervous about the eyebrow wax as i have been getting them threaded for years now, but there are no threading places close to the new casa, so i decided why not? i was pleasantly surprised and will def be back!! thank you top design!!! its good to be pampered on a budget :)

Our love affair with Space began 3 years ago...I was planning our staycation birthday celebration (when you & your partner have the same birthday the celebration becomes an event!!) at the Arizona Biltmore Resort - I was looking for a massage therapist that would do an 'out-call' to the resort. I found Space on yelp -   John came to our suite at the Biltmore and the affair began! After my man's massage, all he said was, 'that was the BEST massage I have ever had' Then I had my massage & i agreed with him! John is attentive to your body's needs, he clearly cares about his craft and you can tell he is not just doing a 'job'.  Since then, we have had many many massages at Space. My better half goes almost 2x/month and I try to get over whenever my schedule allows - the massages are continuously as incredible as they were that wonderful first time.  We are kind of massage snobs and get massages all over the world and all over the valley too (royal palms, sanctuary, etc...) and the massages at Space are better than them all!  Seriously, go get a massage here, your body will thank you!! (and then walk over to LGO for an iced tea & croque monsieur - its right next door!!)

Still 5 stars!!! Space has recently moved to a new 'space' but that is all that's changed - the massages are still of the highest quality & John is thoughtful & deliberate in determining the needs of your body.  I recently had a spa day at the royal palms for Mother's Day & during the quick massage that was part of the body scrub - I thought 'I wish I was getting this massage & space!'  Seriously - none of the spas in the valley offer the quality that Space does! And for that, my back is happy!

Verde = good, quick, close-by & cheap = YAY!!!! So...We went for breakfast last week and here is the result: green chili pork: Delish!!! Tortillas: Delish!! Eggs: Yuck!! Guacamole: Good!! The breakfast eggs are the 'fake eggs' - you know the ones that come in a pourable carton...honestly a little disappointing, because 2 sunny-side up eggs wouldve been muy bueno!! but everything else was on-point so i just wont order eggs again! :) we also ordered take-out this week: the whole lime-oregano rotisserie chicken it was MUY DELISH!!! This is not your grocery store rotisserie - the flavor was amazing!! the whole fam luved it and devoured it - Verde will be my new go to when i dont want to cook dinner or when i need a quick lunch!

Brilliant!!!! let me explain....i have been to gaspers, several times and it is always a great evening. The service is always exceptional and the food is pretty damn good!!   Appetizers:  We love the bruschetta, its not on the menu any more, but Maria & Gasper still have it made for us - melted brie & prosciutto!!! delish and the bread isnt too crust that it breaks and ruins the toppings...honestly its delish and i woule love to eat it every day, but alas my thighs would hate me!! We also frequently get the panzanella salad which is very good.  Entrees: Rigatoni e ricotta!! Hands down the best - amazing - perfectly cooked penne and fabulous sauce - this is our stand-by, always good!! Mushroom pappardelle - also consistently very very good. the mushrooms are delicate and tasty and this is a nice alternative to a tomato or cream sauce. Bolognese - pretty damn good (not as good as my all-time fave at the parlor) the kicker is to add meat balls to ANYTHING!!! OMG - why are they so tender and delicious - is there a secret ingredient of crack added?? we LUV them, but sadly Maria only makes them on the weekends....  :( Strozzapreti - their version of carbonara - good in theory but way too salty and i didnt like the pasta (multi-colored corkscrews?? not really restaurant quality). however the asparagus & meat had great flavor, but the cream sauce ...less salt please!! Veal Marsala- my mom ordered this once, she loves veal & she was a little disappointed with this, not tender and sort of dry she said. so of course i shared my rigatoni with her!!  Desserts: Cannoli: yum yum yum. tiramisu: my son almost died, really really delicious thats all that we talked about for days!! cheesecake: only my mom's is better!! i never eat cheesecake out because most of the time its crap - but  Marias is delicious!! she only makes it sometimes....  Drinks: Chocolate martini anyone? delicious!!! decent wine list (i love the menage a trois) best to buy a bottle...  Overall: go!!! a little pricey, but delicious and fun!! as many times as weve been weve never gotten pizza...well theres always this week!!!

We just had 2 exterior doors replaced by Strong Home Improvement and we love them!!! Travis was a delight to work with - friendly, professional and a great work ethic.  I am a very picky home owner and have been known to be a little difficult :) but Travis was able to meet all of my expectations. He came over twice to get the specifics, he explained to me exactly what he was going to do and kept me updated during the project. He was on-time and cleaned-up everything after he was done.  We have a great new front door and the backdoor looks great too! I have a couple more projects for Travis and I feel confident in recommending Strong Home Improvement to my friends and family.

Yay for Groupon combo package!!! facial, mani/pedi, wash&blowdry = $50!!! this was my first time at the newly opened Deegies Carma and I will admit that I am a picky consumer when it comes to pampering!!! so...how did they do?  facial = AMAZING!!! 5 Star!!! relaxing, not rushed, heated bed, tailored for my skin. Ive made another appt for my next facial.  mani/pedi = Meh...take it or leave it. Not sure what the regular price was, but I would probably not get this service again. I get a mani/pedi 2 or 3 times per month, I love my feet - yes I am picky!! So the mani/pedi, not great, not a great massage, nail shaping, etc. Not horrible, Ive just had much much better.  wash&blowdry = good, regular. Hard to evaluate a stylist's skills based on a wash/blowdry, the only stylist there did fine. She did comment that my hair was incredibly thick (it is), more so than most hair she has done. Based on this comment, Im not confident she could cut my hair. O well, a quick straighten and wash is always welcome.  Overall = go for the facial, stay for the boutique, grab a cappuccino & have a good time!!

a new coffee cafe downtown...hmmm there are quite a few, so perhaps my expectations were high. I invited 3 friends to meet me to test out the new neighbor, we were pleasantly greeted and since the place was empty we had our choice of seats. Perc Up occupies the former spaces of Drip & Toast...It is clear that some money was spent on the interior / decor, but maybe the money wouldve been better spent on the food! Back to the food - the coffee was decent, not great. The food choices were limited, but the waitress reminded us a million times that they feature a full brunch on sat...anyways, the pickings were slim today. We ordered a yogurt parfait, oatmeal, SW breakfast wrap and the veggie quiche. All were just fine, but not great and clearly nothing that creative! In fact the 'house made english muffin' (yes i was thinking MJ sourdough, my mistake) was horrible - and one of my dining companions pointed out that it looked like a Fresh and Easy purchase! Service, although friendly was spotty - however she did get busy with to-go coffee orders. I love breakfast, but didnt love perc-up...the space was nice, but not enough that I would choose to come here over the many other selections that downtown offers (giant, lola, jobot...). until perc up, perc ups their offerings i will not be back

I recently used Gals Walking Pals for an extended weekend to take care of my dog. I was a little nervous, as Henri has some special needs - he's a deaf boxer & has a hard time navigating other animals. So other visits to a pet resort / boarding facility gave been disastrous! I saw some cards for gals walking pals at my starbucks and decided to give them a call.  They were easy to schedule & more importantly came over to meet Henri in my home before I left town. They offer a lot of services & I chose to have Henri stay at my house & the gals came over to play with him everyday.  I came home to a clean, happy dog and a poop-free back yard! The gals even texted me updates & a pic of Henri enjoying himself! They also picked up my mail & left some doggy treats for Henri!  I was impressed with the gals & will use them again.
