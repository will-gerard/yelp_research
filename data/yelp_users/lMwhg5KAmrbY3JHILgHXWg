I've been to this Home Depot a handful of times in the past but today they get 5 stars. Never have I been to a Home Depot or Lowe's or similar and gotten such attention. (I did get help from a master gardener at a Lowe's once, who was awesome!) But for an entire trip, never. I needed fasteners, general housing, electrical, and flooring items, mostly small stuff. I had associates come up to me and ask if I had any questions and every one of them was knowledgeable and helped me make better choices. AND, they actually seemed liked they cared and were interested in what I was doing. And, they were pretty busy today. Long story, if you have a home project and have questions about where stuff is or what you could be doing, go TODAY!!! This review expires tomorrow.

Now with TATOR TOTS!!!  Here's some misc tips:  Ask for bread soonest. And, I'm pretty sure crab cake salad is new to the menu, regardless of what people say. Also, call-ahead seating, especially for lunch. And, all the bar half-booths are open seating.

This place is pretty cool for a variety of reasons. Nice staff, lots of sports. They'll put whatever games you want on, at least for me they have. But, here's where they fall short. Order a meal, get a side salad and sometimes they refuse to put it in a bowl. Every so often, someone insists on putting a salad with dressing on a piece of paper in a plastic basket. I mean, seriously. It's a bowl.

Everyone has different pizza tastes.  So, even if this is just pretty good, you can't beat the value.

This place is ridiculous when it comes to service. This is my second time here and I wanted to see if things were different before my review. They weren't. After hour-long waits for fabric to be cut and insanely long lines at register line something has to be said. I would like to say there was a redeeming event when a customer in the register line asked for a manager. He came out and immediately 3 more registers were opened. Only 2 were previously open. The upside is the line really started moving. The downside is that it took a customer to speak up. This store is disorganized, poorly run and disappointing customers on a regular basis.

People make mistakes. Places make mistakes. And sometimes, there's just a miscommunication. But, it's what happens next that's important. So, kudos to Peter in Seasonal for sticking with me after he clocked out. Thanks to Brad for understanding that I just wanted to find an amicable solution. And, sorry to Luis in Customer Service for having to deal with the other Lowes. They aren't all equal and I like the one I keep going to.

So, I think this place is great. They gave me a duffle bag to take home that I can throw my clothes in when they need to be dry-cleaned or laundered. Then, I just give them the bag. They count my stuff, clean it appropriately (I assume) and have it ready when they say they will. I've had no problems with them and the prices, for what I need done, are comparable to other places. But then, I'm a dude with dude dry-cleaning/laundering needs.   I will say that, so far, I've had no issues with my clothes having stains I didn't start with, as I've had with other places.

Four stars because I "almost" always leave with a great cut and a solid experience. Jenna cut my hair tonight and she did a killer job, didn't talk more than I wanted her to, firm shampoo, shaved my neck and then gave me a quick back/neck massage, which was enough. I tried a shave once Nd found that it wasn't closer than a regular shave, but the experience was incredible. Extremely relaxing, more so than some actual massages I've had.

Walked in and sat right down for a weekday lunch. Ordered right away and now, 45 mins later, we've been assured our food is next. I'm not sure what that means, but I am sure my boss doesn't give a crap. They get the 2nd star because this place isn't always like this. But, seriously, it's not busy.

I opted, by recommendation, for Dagwood's Dream, pastrami, roast beef, ham, mozzarella, onions, lettuce, tomato, and horseradish. All sandwiches are warm, at least, that's how they recommend them. All in all, I'd say a great deviation from the regular sandwich place. Check it out!

My co-workers and I come here 2-3 times a month. We absolutely love it.

Jersey Mike's, in general, is pretty decent for a regular sandwich place. This is my irate trip to this location for lunch an it's busy. I mean, pretty busy. So, no issues with the chain. One thing I did learn is that they will make ANY of the subs hot!!! What??!?!? Nice.

I don't normally order flowers and have them delivered locally.  But, these guys do a really good job.  They're a bit pricey.  BUT, as agreed, they did take a picture of the arrangement before delivery, text it to me and allow me make changes.  No florist has ever done that before.  So, 5 stars on doing a great job and the text.  I'm a bit on the fence when they call to remind me that my ex-girlfriend's birthday is coming up.  It's understandable, I mean, I guess they didn't read my posts on Facebook.  ..... Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!?!?   :'(

Here's what I didn't like, Gorgonzola cheese on my pizza.  Now, here's what I loved: * customize your own pizza * thin pizzas perfect for lunch * 4 flavors of iced tea * patio seating in the shade * I could TRY Gorgonzola on just a small part of my pizza  Here's the thing, I don't care for Gorgonzola cheese on my pizza, but I didn't have to waste an entire pizza on it. I can try 4 different cheeses and 15 different toppings, a few different sauces and oils and probably (I haven't asked) all on different portions of the same pie!!  I'm not going to do it, so let me know if YOU do.

It's a great place with great food in a nice venue. I like the patio and they've had live music, on occasion. But, man, if you're here for work lunch, you really gotta push them to get out in a decent amount of time. I will say that we have balked at coming here on a variety of work days because it can take an excessive amount of time to get in and out.

Modeled after the very trendy Angels Trumpet Ale House in downtown Phoenix, they've taken it a bit further and gone with a full bar, which is awesome. They have 32 rotating beer taps and 4 wine taps. It's a nice layout with plenty of outdoor seating. I'm interested to see what it looks like at night. I've been told that they plan on having live music Tue, Wed, and Fri. They just opened July 18, so I'll give them some slack on the food. New kitchens can take time to work out kinks, so I'll definitely give them another chance. Until then, the staff is nice and this is a great time to get in good with the staff.
