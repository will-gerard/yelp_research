If I could give them zero stars, I would.  My mom's room was never clean and it was hazardous for someone in a walker.  The sink in her bathroom leaked, leaving the bathroom floor constantly wet.  When she complained, the LPN the a towel down and wiped up the water, but never followed through to have it repaired.  The caregivers in her wing should not be called care gives at all.  While we were there Saturday they checked her oxygen saturation, which was low...rather than getting her oxygen tank, the LPN just told her to take deep breaths until it was at a passing level.  Twenty minutes later when we were trying to get great discharged they told us she couldn't leave on a Saturday because she needed oxygen which they couldn't get on the weekend....the need was enough to deny discharge, but not enough to get an oxygen tank.  We did have one caregiver who truly cared and went out of her way to get her into a different room when we pushed for discharge.  I realize there are both good and bad, but in a nursing facility, bad is unacceptable.

Ok...I wanted to go someplace different.  We were in a restaurant rut, so I used yelp to just browse some places in the area.  When I saw cafe boa, I realized that I hadn't been there in about 13 years....time to check out the menu.  So I checked out the menu online and I was hooked...couldn't wait to get there.  We walked in and the ambiance was very nice...romantic, but not overly dark.  When we sat down, my husband looked at the menu and said "what can you eat here?"...referring to my wheat allergy, but I had seen the menu online so i said.."oh, just look" and grabbed the menu. My heart sank when I saw something completely different than I had seen online.  Where was the Sicilian street corn?  Where was the rakija bar?  And the farro risotto?  And the meat and cheese board?  Well, apparently I had seen the menu fit the Mill Ave location and they were drastically different. We were here and already seated, so I had to make the best of it..not much in the gluten free arena, but I settled on the Roma salad with chicken.  My daughter had the gnocchi and my husband had the voodoo penne. WOW...the Roma salad was absolutely delicious.  The tomatoes were perfect...not gooey...really firm.  Large slices of buffalo mozzarella, the chicken was moist, not the standard salad chicken you usually see, and the basil was fresh, all topped with balsamic and some fresh ground pepper...truly wonderful. My daughter enjoyed the gnocchi.  The sauce want overpowering, and the gnocchi themselves were quite tender instead of the standard thick globs of dough you often get at restaurants. None of us finished our meals because the portions were generous. An evening that started out tenuously ended well. Although there admittedly isn't much on the menu that I can eat, I'll be back because what is there is exceptionally well done.  P.S.  maybe we'll hit the Mill Ave location next week for my birthday to check out what looked like an amazing menu.

Great dinner!  I have several food allergies but was easily able to accommodate here.  The salmon and quinoa was delicious and the flourless chocolate cake was decadent with homemade caramel. (reservations accepted only for larger groups)

We did the wine and chocolate tasting Thursday.  The 10 wines were very interesting..everything from very light and fruity to a robust medium body wine.  We ordered the olive plate..it was too large for the two of us.  We left with 4 bottles of wine..can't wait to share with friends.  We're hoping to go back for the custom winemaking session as well.  A great discovery!

I'm not a big fan of BBQ in general, but this was delicious.  We shared a four meat platter, and both the pulled pork and brisket were phenomenal.  Both are items I'll come back for in the future.  We tried the sweet and Smokey sauce as well as the hot and sweet sauce.  Both were very good.  I preferred the hot and sweet, but quite truthfully, the meat was tasty enough to eat without the sauce. Great casual atmosphere with great good at a reasonable price.  Bravo.

Great food, but some of the servers are a little slow.  The core staff is awesome, but they seem to have done problems with new servers.

Well, we decided to try this location because it's close to our home...big mistake.  It took over 30 minutes to get our take out order.  We ordered the Greek salad, chicken Cobb salad and a panini.  There was one customer in front of us with two items ordered.  The woman making the salads didn't seem to really know what she was doing.  She kept referring to what looked like an ingredient list, measuring and adding each item...SLOWLY.  then a couple came in and entered the kitchen area, and she seemed to stop altogether to go talk to them.  Definitely not focused on the customer experience.  After we ordered there was a rush of several customers, so I feel really bad for them as it was basically empty when I get there and we still waited 30 minutes.  The food was ok...nothing special.  The grilled chicken on the salad was tasty, but tomatoes were watery with no flavor.  There was a good amount of chicken, perhaps too much on the Cobb salad, but other ingredients were sparse...like the blue cheese and bacon.  It didn't really seem like a Cobb salad at all. It's quite convenient to my home, but I won't go back...If I'm waiting 30 minutes, I expect the meal to be worth it...It wasn't.
