Some of the best BBQ I have ever found. I would have given the food alone 5 stars. But the wait is really inconvenient, I'm not really interested in sitting at the same table as a bunch of strangers, and the price of the food is up there.

The Gyros are beyond delicious & the customer service is flawless. The woman that took my order was so kind, and brought forks, napkins, condiments, and extra gyro sauce with my order. The best greek food I've found in Arizona.

Not as great as it's cracked up to be. My wife and I each got a pasty, they're extremely bland. The staff and building are as hipster as it comes. Definitely not worth the price. I honestly would've been happier going to Taco Bell.

I've been to three other Thai restaurants in the Chandler/Gilbert/Mesa area, by far the best. The yellow curry was amazing. The owner is on top of everything, not to mention really funny. I will definitely be back!

I've been here four times now. The yellow curry is always delicious, but the portions have gotten smaller since my first visit. I've had the same server all four times, she was always as polite as can be, until my last visit. I understand people have bad days, but don't take it out on your customers.

The food is not even that good. It's just your average burger and fries. But they charge like your eating Kobe beef. It's run by a bunch of unprofessional kids, that need training in customer service. The only good thing about this place is the sauce bar.
