I went in on Monday to have an item packed and shipped. I gave them A108 as the unit number. They entered it as 108. I explained that it needed to be A108 but it was obviously not changed. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday.  I called last night and left a message. I called back again this morning and spoke to someone. They then had someone else call me back to tell me that they had changed it and my package would be delivered tomorrow. I called him and asked if I could go pick my package up so it could get there on time. He gave me the address and rushed to get me off the phone.  No customer service at all. I called the UPS distribution center and was told that he changed it to A018. I paid over $30 to have this sent and delivered on time. Will not go there again.

They have the absolute worst service of any business. They double bill and can't explain why. I'm some areas you are forced to use them. You are forced to use them to service your directv. They are horrible.  Don't move into an area that they exclusive service rights. I'm just sorry that I have to give them one star to get this information out.

Great food and great service!  The orange chicken and beef pho are my favorites. I try to get in at least once a week. Love it!

I was referred to Charlie at Green Ninja by many people. Here's what I know. They are honest, friendly, professional, efficient,  and knowledgeable. I would recommend then to anyone and everyone!
