This place was fantastic! I enjoyed everything about it, the food, the service and the atmosphere.  It was a million degrees outside so I sat inside at the bar. Extremely friendly bartender, friendly locals sitting next to me who totally wanted me to have some of their salad and fabulous food.  I ordered the Grandma's chicken/potato/gorgonzola pizza. It was the St. Louis/flat style. It was to die for. My dining companion had a sandwich. I was told to get the deep dish cookie but, people people, there was no room for cookie. Next time. Had to send the left overs home with the friendly locals sitting next to me. Wow, were they ever so lucky to be sitting next to me that day?

Ok, it's a chain. So what? I try to go here every time I am in town because we don't have a Bandera's at home.  The service is impeccable. The food is delightful.  Since I don't get to venture here often I always choose the Macho salad. It is consistently awesome each time.   On our last visit we sampled the dip duo which consisted of some fresh guacamole and a spicy cheese concoction with some nice, salty corn tortilla chips. Yum!  My dining companion isn't in quite the rut I am in with the Macho salad. This go-round he had the roasted chicken which he devoured. It was juicy, aromatic and flavorful. I know this because some of that chicken was in my salad!  We cannot go wrong with over-stuffing ourselves with the Oreo cookie ice cream desert at the end.  Cheers to you, you lucky ducks who get to dine here whenever you want!

I just returned from a delightful stay at the Camelback. I am a fan, for sure. The grounds are colorful and well maintained. The room is cozy with a private patio. The spa is well designed and everyone was very friendly. The massage was not the best but the environment was superb. Next time I will make sure I ask for someone who can really work the knots out! I had a fantastic manicure from Olga. Overall, the food was great and I practically had to be forced out of my cozy lounge chair after hours in the R Bar. This was a great vacation getaway.

Holy cow, people, run don't walk to this place! By the way, you'll need to get some exercise afterwards, too!  The service was impeccable. The food was over the top crazy-good. Of course the best dishes were pricey but very much worth every penny. I had the Pappardelle Mimmo which was perfectly prepared. My dining companion had the Spaghettini Scoglio. Zero complaints from either of us.  The pasta is made in house. At least try it despite the fact that all of the other ingredients are incredible. Oh, a bit of advice, don't bother with the bread. You'll want the space in your stomach for the entree!  This restaurant is not on the strip but is not far as it's directly across the street from The Hard Rock Casino. Get off the strip for one of the best meals you'll have in Vegas.

Sorry, I can't give this anything higher than a 2 rating. I made the mistake of not staying at my lovely hotel for breakfast. Thought this would be faster to get our day started. Wrong-o.  Long wait on a Sunday morning. Perhaps to be expected. But, after waiting so long, had a mediocre experience. This is NOT food I would typically wait for. The server was so stressed and serving far more tables than beyond his capacity that I doubt anyone was getting decent service. From my observation this was true of all the servers in the area.  The noise level was incredibly loud. This made for a non-relaxing Sunday morning brunch-time.  Personally, I do not see the attraction for the crowd that seemed to be willing to wait for such mediocrity.

This was my second visit to Sprinkles. My first experience, back in December 2010, was also superior. On this trip I was able to experience the full-on cupcake frenzy on a Saturday late afternoon. There was a snake-like line inside the store and then out the front door. My friend looked at the line, then the case and said, "Uh, order me the cinnamon sugar or the strawberry and I'll wait in the car!"  Due to the frenzy, there were no lemon cupcakes so I ordered the cinnamon sugar, stawberry, chocolate peanut butter and the vanilla with chocolate icing. I did not sample the strawberry but the chocolate peanut butter and the vanilla with chocolate were both excellent. Great flavor, great texture. Some of the best I've had.  I like the way Sprinkles ices the little cakes. They don't pipe it on as high as the ceiling. They put it on good and thick but with a spatula. This requires a tad more effort than squeezing icing on from a bag but it is so much nicer to eat this way.  The cakes are very good, the store is clean, the employees were polite and their product is beautifully displayed. What's not to like?

Uh, no. I tried the lemon/lemon (the flavor by which I judge all cupcake bakeries) and my friend had the chocolate/peanut butter. My cake was dry and tasted like fake flavoring instead of lovely lemon flavoring that comes from actual lemons. I did not finish the cupcake. How wrong is that? Also, I was so incredibly disappointed that I didn't even want to know about the chocolate/peanut butter situation. My friend will need to write his own review if he wants to bring up the rating!  I can only hope for the fine people living in or visiting Las Vegas that they have better options for a cupcake fix. Pass on this one, peeps.

This was our second trip to the Mission. We were here in February 2010 and were wow-ed by the great service and the fantastic guacamole the first time around. We made a point to go back this time and were equally wow-ed. We went for a late afternoon lunch and we had the table-side-prepared guacamole. I had the chicken tacos and my friend had the steak tacos. These were small but, as it turns out, a perfect portion to accompany the pile of guacamole we snarfed. Despite the small size of the tacos they were quite flavorful and, again, plenty of food for an afternoon lunch.

I can't believe I'm giving 4 stars to an airport restaurant. Here's why:  This is only one experience and we were hungry due to the flight delay. There was no seating in the restaurant so we sat at the bar and had great service from the bar tenders. We asked about a couple of the menu items and figured two of us were planning to get the same thing so we asked about it and the server indicated the sandwich was 'huge' so we ordered it and asked to split it. They were very accommodating.  The food had good flavor and was well-prepared.  Good experience for eating in an airport. Thanks.

The owners of Paradise Bakery need to take a close look at this one. It's in an airport and it's just inside security. I wanted an iced tea. For a restaurant chain that does this pretty well at their other stores, with brewed tea ready, I thought it was a no-brainer. Yikes, was I wrong?  First, to get the one person to ring me up and get a cup was a challenge. It took way longer than it should have. They don't care. Then, when I asked for a lemon for my tea I was informed the lemons are only for salads. HUH? Such crap. Make a customer happy and give her a freaking lemon. Power trip.  Then I took a sip of my tea and promptly dropped it in the nearest trash can. I want my $2.50 back.  Paradise Bakery owners - get this location straightened out. It gives you a bad name.
