I am a total sucker for quaint bungalow style homes.  (I used to own one, a Sears Bungalow, 1920.)  So this adorable bar/lounge had me as soon as I walked onto the wraparound porch and into the front door.  I could smell the character.  This is a wonderful venue for a date, or, in my case, for a small group of friends to gather.  It has ambiance and then some!  You know that friend of yours who has the great cocktail parties?  That is what it feels like here when the bartender asks for your order.  No positioning to get to him, no yelling your order to him.  He's right there...all for you.  Wow.  I am getting nostalgic here, so let me close with these couple of important details:  1) The wine selection was small but the wines were good, and 2) the cheese/cracker/olive food pairings were quite good.  I left feeling that I had just had a wonderful experience.  Interestingly, there is a bar/lounge in Raleigh, North Carolina that I still remember fondly, years later, because it gave me that same feeling.  I cannot wait for the opportunity to return.

My recent , but admittedly brief, experience was terrific! The service was fast and friendly, the price was good, and the food was really, really good.   A friend and I stopped for a brief appetizer and margarita before heading to the Lyle Lovett concert. Margaritas for $3.00 until 7 PM...YUM! I loved the chips and salsa. The chips are a mixed style and the salsa had an unusual, homemade flavor. We shared an order of chicken nachos and OMG...were they good. Whatever creamy sauce was added was a wonderful addition.   The atmosphere was nice and open; the more modern Southwest style was a refreshing change. And like I said above, the service was friendly and quick.

If you are not enjoying half price bottles of wine...while on the casual outdoor patio overlooking the city...on a Sunday afternoon from 4PM-8PM...listening to the AWESOME band, Delcoa, you are totally missing out on a fabulous event!  This reminds me of my favorite Keats quote, "Give me books, French wine, and fine weather, and a little music out of doors played by someone I do not know."  Don't expect great service, but the atmosphere and the band totally make up for it.  Check out the band at: http://www.myspace.com/delcoa.

I am pissed!  I have been attending the Wrigley Mansion for music on the patio for over a year now, and have been raving to all of my friends about it.  All the stars happened to align this last Sunday, and ten (10) of my friends attended with me.  I was embarrassed because it was no longer the same Wrigley.  In two weeks (since I was there last), all the rules changed.  The cool band, Delcoa, is no longer the band.  There is no longer a $7 buffet.  There remains half price bottles of wine, but they increased the price of the bottles.  Um, excuse me, but if I am going to a casual event on an outdoor patio, why the hell would I buy a $90 bottle of wine (discounted to $45...ooh, what a bargain)!!!?  I swear, even the outdoor lighting has been removed!!!  And they have no Facebook presence where I might have been notified...nothing different on the website to indicate a "rebranding."  They did still have a good crowd.  I think the crowd follows the band, so all of these people were new to me.  But they were not prepared.  The service was very poor.  (Remember, I was seated at a table of 10...Hello!!!?  Cha Ching!!!?)  It's likely I won't be back.

I have seen five (5) films at the Phoenix Film Festival, and all were EXCELLENT!  Luckier still, the movies were free because I was a volunteer.  For an event that is literally entirely volunteer except for the Executive Director, it is organized quite well.  Day One of my experience was not good, and I thought, "This is lame; I am not doing this again."  But by Day Three, I was really enjoying myself, able to see some good films and meet some good fellow volunteers.  The highlight of my experience was meeting the filmmaking crew of Brothers Ink Productions, and being invited to a Private Screening of their short film, "The Author," as part of the Locker 13 series.  http://www.locker13.com/.  This filmmaking team was TOO COOL!  And once you begin to understand the process, you no longer expect perfection because all these films are at different "lifecycles" in the process.  Oh, and I should also mention celebrity "sightings" of Virginia Madsen (Sideways) and Yeardley Smith (Simpsons' Lisa Simpson).  The only reason that this event does not have five (5) stars is because the feedback that I have heard from some of the Festival-goers is that this event is losing quality, and therefore, losing interest for some Festival-goers.

I totally agree with my fellow Yelpers.  Walking in the door to this coffee shop is like walking in the door to your favorite Aunt's house!  Marie is glad to see you, glad to meet you, and glad to help you!  There isn't anything fancy about the menu, and in fact that is what is kinda cool: where else can you get a banana and peanut butter sandwich (except maybe HOME)!?  How cool is that!?  And since Starbucks now is usually overcrowded and loud, I welcome the calm quiet of this coffee shop where I can concentrate and really get some work done using the free WIFI.  If you support local businesses, please support this one.  It is a gem!

Interesting that the salesperson seemed to have no interest in me (I completed a full circle of the first room) until I said that I was new to the area and this was my first visit to this store.  Then the gates opened, literally, as she invited me to see another two rooms across the courtyard.  This is a wonderfully French and quaint store, with beautiful and unusual [read that, "very expensive"] French antiques and furniture with some new gift items thrown in.  Everything in the store is merchandised well and very pleasing to the eye.  The background music was perfect as well.  If I'd had more money, I could have spent a WHOLE LOT OF IT at this store.  However, I did settle on a few small things for a gift basket for a friend.  It's one of those places where you go to dream.

This is another of what I think seems to be very prevalent here: dress up the place, and the public won't guess that the quality of the food is no better than the local Chili's, Outback, whatever.  I found the quality of the food to be average to poor.  The service was good.  The pricing?  Overpriced.  I was in the restaurant, and looked over the greener grass to the bar area.  Maybe I will try the bar, if you could convince me to go again.

Loved it!  This is a terrific alternative to the "look alike" restaurants in Scottsdale.  It is not fancy, meaning there are no white table cloths and the like, but the food is so good and light (and very well portioned)!  The service is friendly and good.  I had to grab my own drinks and silverware, but the table was cleared immediately when I finished.  And the price is right on!

Can I go ANYWHERE in Scottsdale where my friend and fellow Yelper, Michael C., has not been there first?  This is a great little gem.  The grounds are quite nice, beautiful and clean courtyard, with [obviously] suites instead of rooms.  I have to admit that my expectations were low because I had only seen the menu prior to my visit, but when I entered the lobby, I was immediately impressed by the great hospitality.  It was evidenced again when we arrived in the restaurant and were greeted with warm and friendly faces.  We ordered sandwiches, but I will likely return for a few reasons: 1) early Happy Hour...where else can you enjoy Happy Hour starting at 3:30PM!?  And 2) Friday All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry.  OMG, welcome home!  (In Wisconsin, my home, there IS no other option on a Friday night!)  The food was great.  Seriously, I don't think I have had better fries ANYWHERE!

What do I like about this place?  WYSIWYG.  (All you techie geeks out there know what it means, but for those of you who do not know what it means, it is an acronym for "What You See Is What You Get.")  For those of you who know me, you know that I appreciate and love places with no pretense.  Want proof?  Visit her on her "in office day."  Seriously, Dr. Krista is passionate about animals and her practice.  So passionate, in fact, that she is easily drawn into hot debate!  And who else, other than someone who is passionate about her work, would you want to examine your favorite member of the family?

Hmmm, after my experience yesterday, I am really puzzled as to why this restaurant has received such great reviews.   My salad (a  Southwestern salad) was lacking key ingredients: lacking avocado, black beans, and cilantro.  The chicken was overdone, and the greens were old and wilted.  And the service was absolutely atrocious: no courtesy, no greeting, no smile, no nothing.

"I don't know who invented the high heel, but all men owe him a lot."  (Marilyn Monroe)  A girl and her shoes...are a beautiful thing.  From bags to boots to tennis shoes to pumps to sandals, the selection (at least today) was EXCELLENT.  Not only were there a variety of brands but a variety of price points too.  This place had me salivating!  I could easily have purchased three (3) pair but decided to wait and visit again with a friend......it's a chick thing!

I was asked here by friends because they liked it so much.  I did not have the heart to tell them that I was less than impressed.  The service was terrible.  The waiter did not seem familiar with the menu, was slow,  and eventually...wrong.  I ordered a thick crust because it looked so appealing, and he arrived with a thin crust.  I made my own pizza of a favorite combination, and never before...anywhere...has it been so tasteless.  How can Italian sausage be tasteless!?  Somehow Picazzo managed it.  I give them credit for a terrific side salad; great house dressings are difficult to find.

Carl Rispoli is THE BOMB!  He knew how frustrated I was by my car buying experience, so took extra care in helping me walk through my options: for example, some car models have difficulty finding parts, some car models are great for only the first four years of ownership only, some are just poor quality.  Carl and I ultimately settled on just two models; he called me the following day with options that were within the parameters I'd set forth.  The FOLLOWING DAY!  It was also within a day that he obtained three bids for my car...and another day to find me financing.  In the end, it was love at first sight for a car on the AAA Car Buying Service website.  Here is where AAA exceeds even that which I described herein: The car was in IMMACULATE, IMMACULATE condition; I was able to see all the service records for the vehicle I was purchasing; I didn't need a Cashier's Check; I received financing at two (2) percentage points below my bank; and when it was delivered, Carl taught me how everything worked, including syncing my Bluetooth!  Ineffable!  I am so fortunate to have this service.  I will highly...and forever...market it to everyone I know!

OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the "great lakes") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...  The "event" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.  P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like.

I think this restaurant is overpriced.  I recommend ordering from the ala carte menu.  The chips are good (and thin; I like thin chips).  The guacamole was bad.  I think sour cream is used as a "filler."  However, the meal that I ordered (a simple taco with beans/rice) was good.  Nothing stands out as far as I am concerned though.....

I went to the Orange Table because my fellow Yelpers assured me that my dog would be welcome.  She was.  The waiter brought water for my dog before he brought water for me!  But I did not expect that the sandwiches would be so outstanding!  I have since been two or three times, and each time, the food was terrific.  I have to admit, the last time, I was very fustrated because it seemed most of the beers on the menu were no longer being served.  Irritating.  On the other hand, at least I know they offer them, which is more than many restaurants in the area.

I'm pissed.  Surprised...and pissed.  What the hell happened to Orange Table!?  My boyfriend and I stopped for breakfast on Sunday and experienced the worst service I think that I have had anywhere!  We ordered breakfast.  After waiting 25 minutes (for eggs, people...eggs...this is not a big deal), I went inside (because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us) to ask if there was a problem with our order.  The response was, and I quote, "The kitchen is backed up; it should be out in a few minutes."  Note: there was no apology for the wait, and no effort to appease me.  After waiting another 10 minutes, a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day.  When we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food, the response was, and I quote: "Haven't you ever been here on the weekend.  We are always slow on the weekend."  Are you friggin' kidding me!!!?  This is an appropriate response!?  Again, no apology.  No offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait.  And is slow service EVER an acceptable policy!?  A few more minutes went by; my boyfriend and I stood up to leave just as our food was coming.  We even said to the waiter, "We were just going to leave."  No response.  None!  Couldn't friggin' believe it.  I used to tell everyone about this place.  No more.

I have to disagree with Gabi on this one.  It could be me, but I have been here three times now, and each time, I have received terrible service.  I understand how some could love this place; it definitely has a unique atmosphere, but...when I get attitude with my beer, you lose me.

Hmmm...the conversation went something like this:  Me: I'd like to get this skirt hemmed. Her: I can do that; it would take approximately 10 days. Me: And what is the cost? Her: Twenty eight dollars ($28.00). Me: [Choking] What!?  $28.00!? Her: Honey, if you don't want to pay that, you don't have to.  I don't have time for this [walking away from me and the front of the store]. Me: OK.  I guess that's settled [walking away from her and out the front door].  I guess this establishment doesn't need the money...nor the goodwill.

OK, I am new in town so I was unaware that they are trying to change the name of this event to The Great Arizona Picnic, or something of the like.  Well, thank God because when I hear "culinary," my mind certainly does not think of Dos Gringos...or any of the other Vendors represented at this event.  And why the hell, after paying to enter, would I pay again to enter the fenced areas!?  WTF!?    I come from a town where festivals are managed better than most corporations so I believe that I am spoiled, but there is no excuse for the long lines encountered here.  I counted over 60 people in line waiting for pizza...pizza!  Lines to enter, lines to use the ATM, lines to purchase tickets, lines to eat, lines to pee......  Obviously I feel passionate about this particular review, and for those that love this festival, I apologize.  I will say that many people with whom I had spoken who had been coming to this festival for years said that it is no longer what it once was.  On a positive note, the people watching is tremendous.  I have never seen so many beautiful people in one location in my life.  And I would agree that it all depends on the company.  Great friends make this a fun event.

Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!

I love, love, love my chiropractor!  I would like to think he kinda likes me too, but I really think it is just his bedside manner.  He's interested.  And that is what makes him so absolutely charming.  Who meets a doctor who seems interested anymore!?  The office atmosphere is casual and fun, but make no mistake...there is a tremendous amount of knowledge behind the big smiles of all who work there.  In general, the only thing that disappoints me is that their schedule is limited.  However, to their credit, they go out of their way to accommodate people's schedules if they can.

My friends and I wanted to see the Flamenco show.  We had already been to Happy Hour so were not interested in dinner.  We ordered a small appetizer so as not to seem like freeloaders.  The appetizer was extremely poor quality for the price and was presented to us without one of the key ingredients.  The service was terribly slow, given the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty (another clue).  The Flamenco dancing was good but not worth spending the evening here.

Well, since it is too depressing to listen to any media outlet right now, I actually have no idea what this station offers except this:  Third Thursdays (4209 North Craftsman Court, Old Town Scottsdale, AZ 85251, between Dos Gringos and Upper Deck, 3rdthursdaysworld.com).  I was informed of this event by my friend, Armando, and frankly, I can't believe there isn't more excitement around it.  The show I saw last night (Meiko) was TERRIFIC!  It was friggin' cold, but it was terrific!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFJby0MVW4A&feature=related  I am definitely keeping track of this for future events!

I had Happy Hour with friends here last night.  (My one disappointment is that Happy Hour ends at 6PM here; what's up with that!?)  OK, it could have been my company, but I was so impressed with everything here last night, this will quickly become one of my favorite lounges/restaurants.  My Dirty Martini was perfect...perfect!  The waiter was so friendly and genuine that we decided to forgo the waitstaff service to return to the bar for additional drinks.  The appetizers were good.  But the lounge areas and the view were absolutely gorgeous!  This place has such a wonderful ambiance.  It is definitely a place to which I will return, and definitely a place I would like to share with visiting family and friends!

I really like this place, for numerous reasons.  It has the most unique atmosphere.  It actually reminds me of a review I wrote for Ganem Jewelers because there is this duality that is interesting to me.  Normally for me, "wine bar" would invoke thoughts of pretentious sommelier wanna-be type people.  But these guys are pretty down to earth, tattoos and all.  They have somehow created this atmosphere of cool by the unique blend of class along with a little "bad boy" thrown in.  I went for Happy Hour...a $7.00 glass of pretty good wine...and generous pourings (is that a word?) made me a very happy customer.  I cannot wait to try this place again over a Friday/Saturday.

I had a really pleasant evening here.  The atmosphere is pleasant, not pretentious.  The service was good.  Frankly, it could have been a bit better, but it was not bad so...  And the food was really good, I think, for a fair price.  I don't know why but I searched high and low for fish tonight, and most Scottsdale restaurants were asking $22.00 for an entree.  I believe my Halibut entree here was $18.00...with asparagus and a cream sauce...yum!  We also tried the wild mushroom pasta dish.  OMG, was it rich.  So yummy, and so rich.  (Now if I could only find a man like that...just kidding.)

I also recently registered with Scottrade.  Unlike Michael, I could not get through the entire process online, so I aborted.  No matter, the next day, a Scottrade representative called me to ask if I needed assistance.  It was one of those situations where I felt I needed to talk with someone personally...that was no problem either.  They invited me in to the local office, were more than helpful, more than thorough in the registration process, and I left feeling really pleased with the entire experience.  Now, if I could only find some money to invest...

I am from Wisconsin.  Every steakhouse in Northern Wisconsin looks, feels, and acts just like this one.  So I apologize if my review is tainted.  In summary, great meat, with little else.  The service was average, the food (in this case, the sides): average, the atmosphere...ugh.  I'll just wait to experience this...at half the price...next time I am visiting Wisconsin.

I was surprised to see that other Yelpers thought this place was cheap.  Five dollars ($5.00) for a bean burrito is not reasonable, in my opinion.  To be fair, the burrito was pretty large, but I did not like that there was one price regardless of the ingredients.  The real reason that I am even writing a review is because of the poor service.  As soon as I walked in, this large and gruff man said, "Whaddya want?"  And after I ordered, there was of course no "Thank You," no eye contact, no smile.  Poor service is my pet peeve, no matter where it is found.  It just irks me.

I would normally provide the benefit of the doubt but...really!?  The bathroom situation is stuuupid craaazy.  There is no way that we 100 women can use the bathroom during the 15 minute intermission.  It's a "known/problem" that isn't handled well.  It discolors the entire theater experience.

Granted, I had a simple sandwich, but what makes a simple sandwich into an "experience" is the staff, who was tremendous!  I was here for the Cave Creek Wicked Pet Costume Contest.  These people could have been irritated by our "special requests," but instead were so very gracious!  My first request was water...totally free, yet served as though I had ordered it with a full meal.  My second request was lemonade...and the server served it with a smile and an offer to provide free refills.  My third request was lunch, a BLT.  The server offered to bring it to me in my booth outside!  When she brought it to me (quickly, I might add), she even remembered to bring the ketchup for my fries!  And finally, on my last visit inside, they were already closed, but she offered to bring me a fresh water anyway.  How great is that!!!?

Oops...I should have searched the Yelp site before visiting the Mondrian so as not to waste my efforts.  I went with friends after attending the Luminaria exhibit at the Desert Botanical Gardens.  It was a cool night, so my friends and I were hoping for a nice after dinner/hot toddy type of drink when we stopped at the Mondrian.  Nope.  For the hype that this place has received, I was VERY surprised to find no such thing on the menu...heck...not even top shelf liquor.  The bartender sent us to the restaurant, hoping we would find what we were searching for but no such luck.  We each "settled" for a drink from the menu and then left, feeling that the Mondrian is terribly overrated.

I am disappointed that my fellow Yelpers average a 3.5 stars because I loved this place.  The atmosphere is cozy, and the food was outstanding.  I had the Carnitas (real smoked flavor with a crunchy crust) and my mother had the Pollo con Espinacas (with a chipotle cream sauce to die for!).  The sangria was YUMMY as were the salsas.  OK, OK, the service could have been better.  The server was fairly attentive, though I do not think he smiled at us once.  He must not have hurt my feelings too badly though because I am definitely going to return!

I love this place.  In fact, I was surprised that I had not Yelped about it before now, since this is probably the place I have frequented the most since moving here.  I have had both average service and terrific service, but the salads?  Awesome.  Sandwiches?  Awesome.  And I love the patio.  It is my "go to" bar/restaurant when I just do not want to risk a bad meal.

OK, now I am seriously impressed.  The Owner recognized me on my second visit, and bothered to thank me for visiting again.  How awesome is that!?  Not as awesome as the Tiramisu, which was better than I expected!  And huge!  For a girl like me, that would be what I would change actually: I need smaller portions.  Other than that, I still love this place, and my server was absolutely charming!

This was my first visit to The Greene House, and I was really impressed.  The service was outstanding!  The bartender went so far as to offer to make me a Dirty Martini with basil (if you haven't tried this yet, you should...my boyfriend and I make them at home and...YUM!) when I asked about the vodka Gimlet with basil.  In addition, when I stuck up my nose at the caramel topping for the chocolate dessert, he quickly said that he could make a substitution.  And he said I was beautiful, which, of course, always catches my attention!  The salmon creme fraiche bruschetta was OUTSTANDING and actually portioned larger than I expected!  And my main meal (scallops) was outstanding as well!  My only complaint is that I only received two (2) scallops.  Really?  I paid $19.00 for two scallops!?  Lastly, the bar is beautiful...love the FLW influence...and the place was hopping on a Saturday night, which is a very good sign!

This is cool...and very different.  It is such a nice change of pace from the bars/restaurants of Scottsdale where they are all beginning to feel the same.  Love the "make your own fire; make your own fun" concept.  The bar is nothing special, but I hear the burgers are great!  My date and I went a little bit later in the evening, so it was not very busy (which we liked because we had a fire all to ourselves).  The music was OK.  Again, not the type of music that would make me into a groupie of any sort, but it wasn't too bad.  A beer, a campfire, and a date...sounds like Fall in the Midwest!

Dang!  I wish I had seen the reviews prior to visiting this restaurant but...it was not my choice, actually.  What completely freaked me out was that the bill was $85.00!  $85.00 for a meal for two!  For Mexican food!?  Excuse me!!!???  The atmosphere was nice, the waitstaff was average, and the food was sub-par.  Actually, the fish tacos were the worst I have tasted but my date loved the carnitas.  The pitchers of margaritas are largely filled with ice.  And everything is WAAAY overpriced for the flavor and quality of the food.  I won't return.

I had lunch with a friend and fellow Yelper and was pleasantly surprised.  Having driven past and seen only the "Pizza Wine" description, I thought this was a fancy Italian restaurant, as most are.  I found the menu to be quite compelling: a wonderful mix of unusual ingredients, freshly made.  And the style of service reminds me just a bit of Chipotle (one of my favorite fast food restaurants).  Meaning, the food is fresh, good, and reasonably priced.  And the restaurant is clean and modern without being fancy.  I am unable to give five stars only because I have only been here once.  (I haven't tested the consistency of the restaurant yet.)  There is much more that I want to taste, so I will definitely be back!

I had high hopes for this restaurant as I was directed to it by my friend and fellow Yelper, Donald S., and oh...my...God...was the squash ravioli at Tomasos AWESOME!  It was perfect.  It arrived quickly, was presented well, was a good portion for lunch, and geezuz, the sauce was to die for!  It was a bit expensive for lunch, but those of you who know me, know that I say that at almost every meal.  I'm cheap, what can I say?  Oh, I forgot the bread!  It was perfectly baked and came with the most wonderful herb butter.  For bread lovers, this will be on the top of your list!  I highly recommend this restaurant, and I can't wait to try it for dinner!

My BF (who is a Michigan fan) and I went to the Upper Deck to watch the Stanley Cup Final.  He had been here once before and was terribly excited to find the place full of Michigan fans!  This event was no different...standing room only...however, the outdoor patio had a few seats open, so we sat there.  We were never served (by a Server).  After a few minutes, by BF went inside to get a couple of beers.  From that point on it seemed the Server thought we were entirely self-service, so never asked us if we wanted to see a menu, never brought a menu (we asked the neighboring table for theirs when they were done), never checked back to see if we wanted another couple of beers, nothing.  I agree with my fellow Yelpers, Gabrielle Z. and Tyler B.: no thanks.

I love this location. The people are courteous and friendly, and I have never had to wait in line.   To make a very, very, very long story short: I am a recent convert to Wells Fargo. Tom Quinsler, the Branch Manager, for this location went out of his way to assist me in the cash purchase of a home. Due to the large nature of the transactions, my money could have been held for weeks until the bank was certain I was not a terrorist or a thief. Tom inserted himself in the situation and allowed me access to my money so that I could meet the date requirements for my home purchase.   Tom risked a slap on the hand to meet a customers' need, and that is customer service that we just no longer see. My thanks to Tom and his staff for making what could have been a nightmare into a good experience!

I LOVE this little place.  It is around the corner from my office, so obviously extremely convenient.  But I was really pleased when a co-worker and I asked if we could be seated and served within our alotted half-hour lunch that day, and the server said, "Absolutely!"  He was right.  I think the price cannot be beat: soup, main meal, and a couple of additional appetizer-type additions for a mere $6.95!  What is really terrific is that this is no average Asian restaurant.  It has some atmosphere, so the great lunch prices are unexpected and a total BONUS!  I have already returned twice in the last month!

My colleagues LOVE this place!  We seem to go once/week.  I am no Thai expert, but I have to admit, of those we have tried in the Chandler area, this is the BEST.  It's always packed, and that is the first sign of goodness!  For lunch, you get a lot of bang for the buck: soup, tea, wonton, and then the main meal.  Service is average, however...nothing special...but not slow.  I am not certain I would ever choose this restaurant for dinner because I am all about the atmosphere, but this is a great value, and anyway...I like to spend time with my colleagues outside of the office!

My friends and I intended upon Happy Hour at Chelsea's but when we arrived, we were very disappointed to see that the [very small] bar was full.  The Host suggested RadioMilano, as it is within the same family of restaurants.  He was so kind as to call ahead and order an appetizer platter...ON THE HOUSE!  Where do you find service like that anymore!?  When we arrived, we were warmly greeted by the Hostess...even more enthusiastic was the Bartender!  He was extremely attentive to ensure that we had a bottomless glass of water (another touch that did not go unnoticed) in addition to our wine.  (Incidentally, the Plungerhead red zinfandel is a good glass of wine.)  Our first plate of appetizers was good but our second plate...the artichokes...was to die for.  The artichokes were cooked and seasoned just perfectly!  All of us mentioned how pleased we were with the food and the service and are definitely going to recommend this to others.

My date and I thought we would have a late lunch here. Meh. Yes, Emily M., it was nice that they opened the door for us upon our arrival, but that is where the exceptional service ended. Nothing exceptional about the food (nor the food service) here. It was not BAD, it simply was not GOOD either. If you love sports TV, though, this is the place for you! 14 TVs in one area of the bar alone!

This was a terrific experience for many reasons, but it was the service that we enjoyed the most.  Our server, Becky, was friendly, knowledgeable, not pretentious in any way, and more than generous with the servings.  Cory was also very friendly, as were the others that helped us.  In fact, it was great to see that if one server was busy, the others jumped in to help.  We immediately felt among friends.  We were disappointed to see that so many selections were out of stock, so were unavailable for tasting (and thus purchasing), but I agree with Marcus D.: the Porto Cocoa is not to be missed.  Still, it is unique, and a great place to take friends who are visiting from out of town.

I FINALLY was able to visit Roka Akor for the AZ Power Networking lunch.  What a terrific event.  The atmosphere was gorgeous, and the staff was very accommodating.  I have to say that I do not know my sushi.  Normally, I would not eat a dish without knowing its ingredients, but I was very happy with the samplings provided.  And a coupon for a free appetizer to boot!

Actually, this review has nothing to do with the food.  Well, maybe a little: the menu is AMAZING!  And Matthew C. is correct, the staff is wonderful: enthusiastic and warm.  But maybe that is because they get to work a dining room where everyone is laughing!  I attended the Clean Comedy event at The Urban Tea Loft and really enjoyed it.  A bit of a slow start, yes, but ending on a strong note.   (Like a good glass of wine, I guess.)  I highly recommend it.  It is a really nice event for a date, and the restaurant is just so quaint.

Yum, yum, yum.  My fellow Yelpers captured all there is to know about Humble Pie: great atmosphere, great patio, great pizza, great service.  I would only add that I loved...LOVED...the eclectic ingredients that were paired together.  I had the pistachio pie...who wouldda thunk?  It was so good!  Great company makes any experience better, and I had great company as well.  I cannot wait to return!

Well, love the location because it is practically next door, and it is one of those little bars/pubs that feels like home upon walking in the door.  Like Rhonda J., we were lured by the advertisement of a large beer and wine selection.  Like Rhonda J., we were not impressed with the varieties, all of which can be found at your local grocery store.  The exception was that they served La Rossa Italian beer, a favorite of my date.  What caught my eye was that the ice cream cooler was behind the bar!  What we liked about the menu was its prices: most sandwiches are $5.95 and $6.95.  Everything (e.g., fries) is sold separately.  Beer was a fair $3.50 each.  There was no one but us and the bartender/server/waitress at the time we stopped for lunch at 3PM in the afternoon.  She was very personable, but I think we want to try it again when there are more people there.  We'll definitely be back to try it again!

I cannot believe that I have not written a review for this restaurant...where have I been!?  I didn't realize it until I wanted to add them to my "List" [of restaurants for which I could do the PR].  I love this place.  I love its eclecticism...in both the decor and the food.  I have eaten both breakfast and lunch here, and I think the food is outstanding.  (incidentally, I did just see that they now serve dinner as well.)  I would give them five (5) stars, however, the service is a bit sporadic.  Sometimes no server comes, sometimes two servers come...  But I give them the benefit of the doubt because when I asked the Chef (Damn, what is that fancy French name for a baker???)  if he could make me a cake like the cake I had in Prague, he said that he would!  And lastly, I always offer to bring dessert and WOW people when I do, because I bring them an assortment of the pastries on display.  Even though I did not make them myself, somehow I am the hit of the party when I appear with these in hand!

I feel bad that I am giving this such a poor rating because my friend (and now fellow Yelper), Shari V., really seems to like this restaurant.  However, the wine menu is extremely limited, in my opinion, and the food was terrible.  I have a friend, Michael C., who said to me once that it is not fair to rate a restaurant based on only one visit but...  I can't help it.  I had only a half grilled veggie sandwich (because I was sharing), and I couldn't even choke that down.  "Shoe leather" is what comes to mind.  With so many other good restaurants, I would not suggest anyone waste their time with this one.

Well, Michael may not exactly want me to write that he has given away his knowledge and services for free but...I feel compelled to write about it because it gives you insight to his belief and value system as a business owner.  I have not bought a computer from Michael (though I think the service package that he offers with each new computer is OUTSTANDING).  But he has given me so much advice as a new business owner/entrepreneur: from advertising, to computers, Facebook and social media, from bartering and funding sources, to organizations and people to know.  He is a wealth of knowledge, and he is so happy to share it all because he believes in the local business owner.  THAT is why I love RedSeven!

After driving some time (the entire time thinking, "It can't be this far!"), we finally found QCOM.  I recommend calling ahead for the hours because we were surprised to find them closing for the day.  Unfortunately, this means that we did not get the best they had to offer: samples, sandwiches, or tours.  (We received a rushed and shortened version of the tour.)  But it is informative, it is unique, and it does make me want to return for more.  The retail shop is where I really could not get enough: all the blends and combinations...garlic parmesan, artichoke and roasted garlic, carmelized red onion and fig...everything sounded so wonderful, it was difficult to leave without spending a whole lotta cash!

I joined friends for lunch at the Tatum location and was really, really pleased.  The service was friendly.  The atmosphere was really nice, and the food (I had the taco lunch special) was outstanding!  I will definitely be back to this location, and it has me curious enough to try some of the other locations as well.

I would never have thought from it's quiet exterior that when I opened the door, the place would be bustling!  What have I missed!?  I love this place!  I ordered a burger and fries for only $12.00 ($12.00 is cheap for a good burger in Scottsdale), and it was absolutely the best I have tasted in...as long as I can remember.  The pretzel roll made artwork of a burger!  I love the prices and what I especially love (LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE) is that you have the option of a full or half order for almost every entree on the menu!  How sweet is that!?  (And health conscious!)  Can't wait to get back there!

Great place for a romantic evening, though I had gone with some friends.  I really enjoyed the music, and the staff was terrifically accommodating and friendly.  However, it was REALLY dark, and the location of the bar (at the back of the room) made it difficult to see the stage (at the front of the room).  But I would go again, if only to enjoy the music of Khani Cole.

I had a good experience here.  The atmosphere was clean, friendly, inviting, and even a little bit "swank."  My server, Sean, was outstanding, especially considering my diet requests.  (For example, how many customers actually ask for salad greens only and sea salt as opposed to table salt?)  I thought the portions were huge for the price.  In fact, [too] large portions are a pet peeve of mine because I hate that so much food goes to waste.  Overall, I was really pleased.  One tip which might have made for the excellent service: we went early, 5:30 PM.  What can I say?  I was with my elderly parents.

Like many restaurants in Scottsdale, this is all style and no substance.  The food is good, but subpar for the prices paid.  I even returned a glass of wine because it simply was not worth the $10.00 cost.  And we did not think the menu was anything special or unique.

This has to be one of the most quaint and romantic cafes in all of Scottsdale.  This is a cafe for those who really enjoy a good meal, with perfect company, in a perfect setting.  The food is good...and GORGEOUS!  If you are a picky eater, this may not be the place for you, because the chef (Chris) greets every person, speaks with him/her briefly, and decides what ingredients are the perfect blend.  In some ways, it is unfortunate that this cafe is so small (maybe 6-8 indoor tables???), but then one would never feel the personal touch that such a small cafe affords.  This is definitely one of those restaurants that I want to share with all my family and friends.

I love, love, love this cafe!  The atmosphere is close to perfect.  In fact, I lunched there today with a professional photographer, and she was so impressed, she asked Chris (Chef/Owner/Proprieter) if she could return for a photo shoot, to which he obliged.  The food was beautiful (as always), cooked to perfection (as always), and a wonderful new combination of foods (as I have come to expect).  I continue to tell everyone I know about this place!

Of course, everyone was likely on their best behavior the night a friend and I tried True Food because Dr. Weil was sitting at the table next to us.  So the service we experienced could not have been better...and I love it when food is served "complimentary."  Love it.  To tell you the truth, I do not remember the prices, I remember the food.  I loved that the meal and pairings choices were different, and I have never had better fish anywhere.  It was so wonderfully flavorful!  The restaurant is clean and sparse, yet beautiful, and not pretentious by any means.    I will return!

A friend and I had dinner at The Mission, and were really impressed.  The food was excellent; the freshly made guacamole is a unique twist and the fries are perfectly made.  And we were really glad to see what seemed to us to be actually two pricepoints on the menu.  We opted for the less expensive tacos (fish and steak), and were SO glad that we did because, having already inhaled the guacamole, anything more than the tacos was much too much to eat.  I'd like to try a few more items on the menu before I upgrade this to 5 stars, so that means I'll definitely be back!

I have not attended one of these events in the past, so I did not know what to expect, but I thought it was a terrific event/venue.  Impressive was that minutes after walking in the bar, we were offered free tastings of Tequila Sol de Mexico.  Very smooth, and in fact, refreshing, if drank when cold.  See this link for more information:  http://soldemexico.com.  I was so anxious that I might be the wallflower.  (Does everyone have that same anxiety?)  The people [Yelpers] were very open and relaxed.  Conversation flowed easily, and I felt comfortable almost immediately.  Of course, Gabi, is terrific about introducing Yelpers to one another.  Gabi [Yelp] was generous with beverages and food, and The Mission is simply beautiful with a great warmth to it.  Thanks, again, to Gabi and Yelp, and I look forward to another event!

Hmph...  Well the atmosphere is beautiful, a little quirky... And the service was...well...average...  But I did not care for the menu whatsoever.  Very unusual items, but no healthy options actually.  I think I ordered the only healthy item on the menu: a Portobello mushroom sandwich.  It was good.  The Gorgonzola slaw side item was good and unusual.  I would have really liked it, if only it weren't so salty.  :-(  What we noticed was the everything we ordered came with pistachios.  Now, I loves me my pistachios but really?  The appetizer, meal, and dessert?  Really?  The AZ88 restaurant theme seems to be their niche; they should stick with it.

OK, how can I possible expound upon my fellow Yelpers!?  I LOVE this little place.  It's nearly perfect.  Let me start at the end: FINALLY!  FINALLY someone gets it, and has opted to try what I have been telling my friends for years...if a restaurant would just give you a little something, a tiny chocolate, something to end the meal, it would be perfect!  And damn, if Tuck doesn't deliver!  I loved my meal, and my 7 other friends were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food.  But I have to say, the most wonderfully suprising little dish is the Quinoa Cakes: crunchy, flavorful, light, and unusual...all my favorite things!  And for a girl from Wisconsin, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by the Cheese Curds.  Y.U.M.  And I agree with Jen R. when she states that "just about everything about this restaurant feels good."  The lighting was perfect and warm, the furniture, modern, the service was incredibly prompt.  And Tuck was part of a very happy night for me!  Thank you, Tuck Shop!

I agree with Gabi...100%.  He spent all day here with me one day, completely reinstalling a toilet, so I was shocked at his more-than-fair fee.  His response?  He wanted to ensure that I would continue to be his customer.  He said that many of his customers are divorced or single women who haven't the knowledge or time to compete the odd jobs around the house.  As far as I am concerned, Duane walks on water!

I agree whole heartedly with my fellow Yelper, Phil S., who stated, "...misses the mark for excellence.  Ingredients are wonderfully fresh, and top-quality but...Prado feels a bit overrated..."  I ordered the beet salad because it sounded so different.  When it arrived, I could not help it, it just fell out of my mouth, I said, "That is the smallest salad I have ever seen."  The waiter (who was awesome) did not skip a "beet" (couldn't resist) and responded with, "Would you like some fresh greens to go with that?"  You have to love the man and you have to love the professionalism because they did not charge me for that great little side salad.  The atmosphere is just gorgeous, right down to the gorgeous men having drinks poolside at the more casual restaurant, ROQ, across the courtyard.  But the menu, in my opinion, just uses fancy words for sandwiches like "chicken" and "tuna salad," and isn't truly different or appealing.

The atmosphere is nice: clean, modern, spacious.  I never had the coffee.  I had to wait in line too long.  When it actually came my turn to order the person behind the register walked away and began to dry wine glasses along with a co-worker (note: ALONG WITH A CO-WORKER...meaning, there were other Staff members there who could do that work), while I stood there, waiting, in total disbelief.  She was clueless, I think, as to why I finally walked away.

I have not returned yet (although I expect to soon as I have a planned event at Press next week), but I think it is fair to share that the Owner contacted me regarding my review.  He was, of course, in his words, "disturbed...All I can say is I apologize for your experience and only ask that you give us a second try if you are in the area."  That is good reputation management, and appreciated by me!

I am new to the area, but I think this used to be J. Chew, based on conversations that I overheard and a little bit of research on Yelp.  I really liked my first experience here, largely because of the friendly atmosphere that Renee, the bartender, creates.  Granted, she is helped by the size of the bar.  It is small, but that is its charm.  One can enter, sit, and get to know the others at the bar within moments.  It makes for that neighborhood bar "where everybody knows your name" kind of feel.  A turnoff for me was when I asked what type of bar or what entertainment, if any, was going to be offered.  I was told, "I am not certain we know yet."  In my opinion, if you are already open and serving customers, it is too late.  But who knows what can happen?  The place definitely has potential!

OK, I am a little concerned that I am spending so much time here...but I can't HELP it!  It is so perfectly between club scene and dive bar scene, neither of which I am a fan.  It's new without being pretentious; it's energetic without being loud.  I like it!  I like the location.  I like the people (both the people who work there and the people who play there).  I like the prices.  And I love the vibe!

I agree with Joe H.  Nothing special enough to make me want to return here.  And it is always a clue when the restaurant likely holds a couple of hundred people but is empty.  To their credit, my mother really enjoyed the fish.  I had fish tacos, which were absolutely average.  Service?  Average.  Atmosphere?  They should have put all that cash into paying the Executive Chef.

I first experienced PetSmart in North Carolina, and have been incredibly pleased with all the services.  Let me tell you that a one-stop-shop for my dog [pet] is the best!    At this location, I have used the groomer, the PetsHotel, and will soon be using the Banfield Veterinarian Clinic, which is to open at this location in April 2009, I believe.  I have to admit, I do think the cost of the products and services is on the high side.  I do not think I have ever purchased any merchandise (except possibly dog treats).  And yet, for some people (like me), a dog is more than a dog.  Shoot, the first time I dropped my dog at the PetsHotel, I got all verklempt!  So it is important that not only my dog be comfortable, but for them to make me comfortable too.  I am willing to pay the price to be so consistently pleased with the services.

I love this little place.   The fact that it is down the street from my office and just off the 101, makes this place oh-so-convenient.  The service is terrific, going so far as to 1) try to make me an Arnold Palmer from what they could find behind the counter, and 2) letting me exchange my melted KitKat for a frozen one after I decided to eat outside one afternoon.  I had the chicken sandwich with pesto sauce, and it was YUMMY.  It was a great price too (which is very, very important to me).  Just a great little place to hang...love it!

I have eaten lunch here (sandwich, chips, obligatory pickle), but I am specifically Yelping about the bakery.  I purchased a "Holly Go-Lightly" cake for my Mother to celebrate Mother's Day, and was really disappointed.  The price is steep (over $30 for an 8 inch cake...maybe it was even a 6 inch cake...) but I have always been willing to pay for those extra special touches.  But there was nothing special about this cake.  I admit, I was taken in by the glittered frosting, however, the frosting was not as good as most buttercream frosting on your average wedding cake.  And the [yellow] cake itself was dry.  My Mother said that maybe we did not serve it appropriately (meaning, that cake is ideally served at room temperature as opposed to directly from the refrigerator) but come on, we know good cake when we taste it, cold or warm.  So, after the "ooh" and "ahh" I received upon opening the box, that was the last of the compliments.

I don't get it.  Why the good reviews?  OK, the marketplace is really pretty cool, but nothing too, too special.  And the menu SOUNDS wonderful but...  After receiving great service while ordering, I waited...and waited...and waited for my three egg omelet.  I had to finally ask about it and when it arrived?  ICK!  Brown, dry omelet, and the potatoes were like hockey pucks.  Really pretty bad, I thought.  Disappointing because place definitely has atmosphere.

I was really pleased with my entire experience here...with the exception of the name of the restaurant.  The name is too "brown bag," too generic for this little gem in the middle of the city.  It is quaint but not so quaint that those with testosterone would not see its great qualities!  The atmosphere was ideal: old bungalow home, great patio--very large--with shade for the heat of day and heaters for the cool of night.  The food was excellent, VERY reasonably priced, and the service was outstanding!  We happened upon this restaurant by accident so were really glad to see that they serve brunch until 3PM.  And we were so impressed with brunch that we will return for lunch and dinner.

Yes, the Staff is amazing: very conscientious, very friendly, and the General Manager, Tracy, stopped several times to chat with us.  The tots are AMAZING, but when I complained to Tracy that they must have been cooked in the same oil as the fish, he did not hesitate one second to offer us a second dish of sweet potato tots, on the house!  I was there with a friend for lunch, and the place was hopping with a good crowd.  It is a tavern like atmosphere but brighter, cleaner, and more welcoming!

All the elements came together perfectly one Friday night: great service, great food, wonderful company, and amazing atmosphere to create a very, very good memory for me.  The food was roll-around-in-it good, but I was most amazed by the Server who had the most wonderful sense of timing and a dry (barely discernible, but very much THERE) sense of humor.  She was a joy to talk to!  I can't wait to return to this little slice of heaven!

My favorite characteristic of Troy and his Crew is his terrific customer service!  He will always make time for me, even on the busiest of days, and if he can't actually stop, he will let me know that.  THAT, in itself, is HUGE.  His communication, to ensure that he is setting the appropriate expectations, is unmatched.  Moreover, he has often offered to help me fix something via phone...how f'ing remarkable is that!?  I would highly recommend Troy and his services to all my family and friends!

OK, this place is totally cool, regardless!  To be truthful, I only had an appetizer and beer when here, and I ate at the bar, so my service was terrific.  But...  I couldn't get over how cool it was to watch the ice from inside the restaurant!!!  This is a GREAT place for a casual (albeit, very casual) date.  And, um, for my single sisters, where do you think you will find men?  Can't wait to try it again!

I agree with my fellow Yelpers.  This is a fun little venue, and worth the $7.00 cover charge.  The singers might not actually have the best voices, but they are definitely talented entertainers.  I went early-ish (9PM) and there were no seats left.  However, the place really didn't start jumping either until about 10:30PM so...

Well, I love this place, but it is because I am biased to the Staff, whom I think are wonderful!  They are helpful, and almost always smiling.  I LOVE that they bring me my order when it is ready!  I love that it is casual, more like you are at your best friends house than a coffee shop.  Love the smoothies, and thanks to my friend Brad, now LOVE the oatmeal.  I know, OATMEAL!  And the breakfast burritos have GOT to be totally fattening because they are totally awesome!  If you don't already know, you can get a big ol', kick-that-hangover's-ass omelet, made to order, with cheesy potatoes every Sunday for a steal!

These guys ROCK!  When you enter this store and see the overwhelming beauty of all the jewels displayed before you, you immediately assume pretense, but there isn't any.  This is a group of guys who love great, quality stuff, and are eager to help.  They have GORGEOUS jewelry for women.  And they carry some very unusual lines, like NightRider...very manly...for men.  Actually, once you get to know them, you know that all of them are manly men.  So there is this incredible irony that I just love!  I attended a Girls Night Out event last night, and it was amazing!  I highly recommend the upcoming Fast Times, Fast Cars event for men!

These guys are so darn friendly!  I love it!  When I dropped off my bike for a tune up, these guys quickly assessed what I might need to spend in repair.  Cool.  As I waited for the assessment, I noticed that another customer was at "the bar" hanging and chatting while they repaired his bike.  When I made reference to "the bar," he said I should show up on a Friday.  It seems all their customers like to just come to the bike shop and hang out.  How cool is that!?  I wish I lived closer to this place so I could experience it more often but, alas, it is across town from me.  I should also admit that "they had me at hello," 'cause when I called two previous times with a couple of questions, they were so courteous and friendly, I was actually eager to see their faces and meet who I had been talking to!  The only reason that I would not offer up a 5 Star rating right now would be that I haven't actually picked it up yet so cannot say more about the process for checking out, or quality of the repairs at this time.  Although...I bet it's great!

I agree with my fellow Yelper, Kari E.: "Holy crap!"  This was SO much more than I expected!  I was there for a small networking event this morning, declined the tour, and was very sorry that I did.  I walked into and past a few of the exhibit areas, and found them totally cool.  I will be back for the full tour.  Examples of a couple of the coolest exhibits I saw: 1) a room that housed guitars by Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, and Paul Simon, to name just a few, and 2) the Conservation Room which has glass doors/windows so that you can view the scientific process of conserving an instrument.  From old Victrolas to room size [Hungarian, I think] organs, the place is friggin' huge!  120,000SF of which 90,000 SF is exhibit space.  Just beautiful; can't wait to go back!

Those of us "foodies" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.  I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].  We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].  The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].  The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].  And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!) was incredible [STAR 5].  'nough said.

Not happy...not happy at all. When will service organizations realize that it really takes so little to keep a customer happy?   I have been trying for DAYS...DAYS...to contact the Service Manager to talk about my recent experience (which totaled over $1,000, by the way). I was not happy with my recent service, and I do not even know what I want, except that I know that I WANT to talk about it with someone who has the influence to improve it!!!   So now, what could have been a simple conversation, is escalated to me telling my fellow Yelpers that these people PISS ME OFF!   I have been patient to this point.  I did not complain when it took nearly one entire day to complete an oil change.  One friggin' day!  And it took five (5) days to complete this most recent work (of a water pump replacement).  Hellooooo!?  How do you people think I am getting to and from work!?  Oh, and maybe you could call me to let me know the status!?  Why do I always have to call YOU!?  I hate 'em.

OK, to be fair, I have to let you know that the Service Manager called me, literally, as I hit "Post" on my review.   I do not think that I received an equitable arrangement for my issue, however, even though the Service Manager was kind enough to meet me on a Saturday and listen to my complaint.   Humph, they offered to repair another part (at cost) that I was not even aware needed to be repaired! So technically I entered with a $1,000 grievance, and left with a $1,150 grievance.   I appreciate the effort but...will just not return.

OK, I am largely a fan of ROQ because of the Friday Night Summer Long Concert Series.  Awesome!  I will go almost anywhere to hear live music, especially when it is free.  Be warned, you may need to call ahead and reserve a table because the place is packed!  While I was waiting for the concert to start, I ordered fish tacos and a white sangria.  The tacos were very good but way overpriced.  I have to say that I expected as much; it is a hotel, after all.  I am going again this Friday...'nuf said.

Wow, I cannot believe I have somehow missed a review of Echo Coffee when I have been telling everyone that I know about it!  I love that it is local.  I love that it is NOT bohemian (though I like those types of coffee shops too), meaning, it has a certain atmosphere of modernity and professionalism.  It is less frenzied than many other coffee shops I have frequented.  I love the food, and I think it is significant to note that they offer more than donuts and sweet rolls; the salads and sandwiches are great!  And ya gotta love it when they say, "Please sit down, and we'll bring it to you when it's ready."  Yea!

This place is so friggin' cool, I am surprised that more people do not know about it!  Um, I think you HAVE to love beer (specifically Wisconsin beer) memorabilia, you have to love Anthropologie like clothing, you have to love good old fashioned drinks, like Greyhounds, Old Fashioneds, and Sidecars.  You have to love home made potato chips and a wait staff who want to call you by a nickname.  You have to love cool, old warehouses and funky people, and the unexpected.  I'm in love.

I was totally diggin' this place!  Now, the best part of dining is the company you keep, and I am certain that had everything to do with it, as I was with two of my best besties!  :-)  Went on a Sunday, after hiking Pinnacle Peak.  It seems fancy schmancy on the outside, but it's not.  Service was casual but awesome.  LOVED the half-and-half fries, and LOVED my little sliders.  In fact, I could only eat two of the three.  I actually thought this place was a pretty good value on a Sunday afternoon.  Note: GREAT place for kids on Sundays!

OK, I hate to be negative, but this place is missing its marketing "sweet spot."  (Pun intended.)  This place needs to market itself as an after dinner LOUNGE!  The concept is outstanding, but I lose the enthusiasm of booze and ice cream (two of my favorite things!) when I walk in and it feels a bit like Grandma's house.    The ice cream is absolutely outstanding though, really good flavor and texture.  The price is fair.  And the service was good.  I think I was speaking with Lee herself, who seemed a bit shy, but nice.  I hope she does well; I'll be eager to follow her success.

Let me start by stating that I have only been to this restaurant once, which is why I have not given five stars.  Meaning, that I have not had the opportunity to determine whether the food and service that I experienced is now consistent, or consistently better than the prior reviews listed here.  To my fellow Yelpers here, I am sorry, I completely disagree with your expectations that a restaurant is responsible for the behavior of the children frequenting it.  The restaurant should be rated on what is in its control.  I do not work, nor have ever actually worked, in a restaurant, but I am able to recognize how difficult it would be for a restaurant Manager/Owner to comment on the behavior of the children of their patrons without offending them and losing them as customers altogether.  I attended a networking event at this restaurant last night and was quite pleased.  I love the bar.  But it is not a Legends or a Zipps, and that is why I love it.  It is not a bar for the guy who wears his team jersey around town, but rather the guy who just wants to have a beer and watch a game after work with a colleague or a friend.  The Staff was incredibly friendly, the food was good, and the drinks kept coming, so I was happy.  Now, could they have been on their best behavior for us?  Possibly.  But I am glad that they WANTED to be on their best behavior for us.

Looove this place!  I loved the sexy, yet simple atmosphere.  I felt as though the air was cleaner somehow just walking inside.  Let me first say that Happy Hour prices were outstanding!  I have to admit, I think my favorite Happy Hour spot, StingRay, has just been outdone!  The food was delicious!  All of it!  ALL...OF...IT!  From the cucumber salad to their famous appetizer, the mustard leaf wrap, it is flavorful and fresh.  The service was pretty good, but there was some confusion I think more than once, so it delayed the service a bit.  When I have to stop and say, "Hey, where's my [fill in the blank], I know the service is lacking, although I would say not enough to keep me away!  I was really, really happy when I left here, might have been my company, but we all loved it so that is what mattered!

Locals: GET HERE!  I think the $89 special for a massage and the use of the spa facilities was well worth it, even more so if you are lucky enough to receive your massage from Chris/Kris.  She's awesome!

I love this little restaurant.  A friend suggested it to me, and I have been recommending it to others ever since.  It is absolutely charming, the food is good (and a fair helping at a fair price), and the waitstaff was both efficient and friendly!  I cannot wait to try it again next week!

I really want to give a better review because the Staff seemed nice enough.  However, there were too many elements that turned me off.  This is a seemingly middle of the road restaurant, however, they act like a fast food restaurant: no glasses, napkins, or silverware...and my Bento Box was served in Styrofoam (even though I was asked, "For here or to go?").  The salad that was served with the Bento Box was less than sub par; all I saw was old iceberg lettuce.  To their credit, the piece of salmon that was served was of very good size.  The taste was nothing special, but it was not bad either.  They made the mistake of giving us a "free sample" of the California Roll.    It scared us.  If this was what we would experience when the sushi arrived, it was AWFUL because it was so obviously OLD!  The sushi was much better than our "sample" when it arrived, thank goodness.  All in all, this is a poor value for the quality of the food.  Sorry Yoshi.

OK, having just arrived back from NYC, and having just experienced Lombardi's there (which is supposedly world famous), it is NOT as good as Spinato's.  This is my third or fourth taste of heaven, as we often order pizza for our office crew, and each time it has been fantastic!  Granted, I stick with the plain old pepperoni or sausage pizza, so others may not be as tasty.  Doesn't matter 'cause I LOVE it!

Although most of the reviews I have read seemed to say that this restaurant is "girlie," my boyfriend and I had a really nice breakfast there this Saturday.  We went a bit later (10:30AM), hoping to miss most of the breakfast crowd but...that is why I am unable to give them five (5) stars: our meal was a bit slow.  However, the waitress addressed it before we needed to say anything, and offered to pay for our muffin "appetizer."  The service was great: attentive and friendly, although, like I said, the meal came slow.  The atmosphere is just beautiful; we really enjoyed the misting on the front patio.  And, if it makes a difference to those reading this, there was more testosterone at the table behind us.  The price isn't bad either.  It was just a really nice way to start our Saturday.  Oh, and we just learned that they are starting dinner service as well.

I was referred to Coblentz by a friend, and I am so thankful.  I really respect and trust Cornelius.  He arrived at the time scheduled and his rates were [are] very reasonable.  He has a great energy.  Not that you need that in an electrician...no pun intended...but when I was freaking out, he was calm and cool.  Oh, and he liked my dogs!

This is one of my new favorite restaurants!  A friend and I had what equates to a vegetarian lasagna (I forget the name)...YUM!  And the mushroom risotto...YUM!  I had a nearly perfect martini, made just for me, with extra olives on the side just 'cause they love me (or so I would like to think)!  In other words, great service!  And it is a hop, skip, and a jump from home.  How could it be any better?  Seriously, I hardly ever choose Italian when I am eating out, but this place will make me rethink my choices every time!

Love it!  I had no idea until my neighbor suggested it.  I am so very glad that he did.  The entire meal was so good: from the margarita, to the ceviche, to the main meal, and then...dessert...my oh my oh my, did we love dessert!  The service was very good, and the atmosphere if fun and light.  I will tell all my friends!

I tried to get in for dinner last night, and I couldn't!  Awesome that, for a new hotel/restaurant, they already have such a problem!  I just noticed, too, that they are a "a Joie de Vivre Hotel."  I love these hotels because they emphasize the experience with all the "little somethings" that make you feel good about being there.

This is my new favorite restaurant!  I cannot say enough about it: from the service, to the meal, to the atmosphere, it all has "Karri" written all over it!  The food is amazing!  And if you order chicken, you're just a fool, because the seafood selections are wonderful.  Even the lamb, ordered by my friend, Brad, was plentiful and the most gorgeous presentation I have seen in quite some time.  We were at the bar, and so were served by the Bartender, Lawrence.  Great guy.  Didn't need to go anywhere else after that.  What I loved best? The creme brulee, my absolute favorite dessert, was HUGE...and served with cookies!  Are ya kiddin' me!?  Fabulous!  I can't wait...can't wait...to come back!  Save me a seat, Lawrence!

I know I may be squashed by my fellow Yelpers but...I have not been impressed by breakfast here.  I've been here three times now, and the breakfast has been sub-par each time.  In all honesty, I have NOT been here for lunch or dinner so...take my review for what it is worth to you.  I hope to be able to try another meal, but I come here after my morning hike at Gateway Loop.  I still love this place because it is such a surprise in the middle of the desert!  On the outside, you see a car wash and gas station, but on the inside, the gift store rivals AJs!  And in fact, the last time I was there, I was there only to purchase earrings for a Saturday night out!

OK, to be fair, my fellow Yelpers must know that the Manager of Tom's Thumb has attempted to remedy my last review by asking me to come again.  I LOVE that gesture, and it was very much appreciated!  I am only sorry that it took me so long to 1) return, and 2) to update my review.  I returned in November to an updated menu and better service, which was a most pleasant surprise!  I would like to say my breakfast experience was different, and it was a bit better, but not markedly so.  Like I said earlier, please don't let me taint you, as I don't really think that breakfast is their specialty.  Go for lunch or dinner.  But please also remember that the Manager did try to do the right thing.  We're simply not getting it JUST right (Mama Bear).  :-)

I'm not certain that I could add anything to what has already been written.  I was really disappointed...no...I was pissed, for all the reasons mentioned here.  Even the music was horrible.  But it makes me curious what the Event Planners has intended this event to be!??  Ironically, my pictures from the event are just beautiful!  Being able to be there, under the balloons, with so many of them right there to experience was cool.  I hope they can build on that in the future.  Unfortunately, now they will have to work twice as hard to get me to come back.

I was more than pleasantly surprised by my afternoon lunch here.  I was impressed.  The waiters were terrific: personable yet straightforward, and quick!  The food, although a bit expensive, in my opinion, was excellent.  In fact, my Grilled Shrimp Salad was one of the best I have ever tasted!  It was outdone by the dessert, however.  We were encouraged by the Server to try the Coconut Cake, as it was his favorite.  I don't even especially like coconut but it was fantastic!  The cake was dense, the frosting was buttery, and creamy, and not-too-sweet.  The meal was absolutely perfection!  I would definitely recommend this, with some time at the museum, for a perfect afternoon!

On a random Tuesday night while here with a friend, I observed the most beautiful men coming and going from this place!  That alone was enough to make me want to stay awhile, but this is actually a very cool little place!  Modern aesthetic, friendly Staff, and great food, but I have to say that I am especially excited by the JUICE!  This is now the third JUICE place in Old Town, and I am ECSTATIC!  FINALLY!  The only thing more exciting to me is that they use recycled materials, and sell soda/water that benefits others when purchased.  I LOVE a company that cares about its footprint and the welfare of its people!  This is fast becoming my favorite little spot!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  Everything about my experience here was sensational!  The location is great, the space is downright cozy, and the waitstaff seem eager to help and really happy to see you!  The Arancini is a MUST HAVE!  What I loved most is when I was asked about my old fashioned, I made what I thought was an under my breath type of comment but within a few minutes, the bartender/manager (I don't know WHAT his role was) asked if he could make me another one.  ABSOLUTELY!  I am totally sold on this place and highly recommend it...especially when you want to feel loved.  :-)

Although they have some work to do (I have been here twice, and both times, the waitstaff forgot multiple items on the order), they are nice people, trying to create a place where people can gather over a light meal and enjoy the space.  And a wonderful little space it is!  It really does have a nice VIBE: clean, modern, simple.  The food is similar: simple, not fancy, not stuffy.  And I really do love the coffee!  But really what impresses me most is that this little start-up has a pretty good crowd on a Saturday!  (I think that is a Billy Joel tune...)

Love, love, love this (not so) little coffee shop!  If you are walking South on Scottsdale Road and looking for a cool place to just "hang" a bit, keep walking until you get to SIP (at the corner of Goldwater and Scottsdale Roads).  I love it for so many reasons, mostly because it is cool, but not modern, and hip, but not hipster.  The Staff is friendly and genuine.  And to be very frank, I was completely surprised that I loved the Iced Cartel Americano.  OK, I 've had Americano at Cartel, and I SWEAR it doesn't taste nearly as good!  And the vibe is much, much better.  It's "homier" than the "I'm-so-creative-I-don't-even-have-an-office" coffee shop crowd.  And I love that I can bring my dog!  :-)

So much to offer...  I love Modify. I love its vibe, I love its services, I love its people. It's vibe is welcoming...not necessarily yogi-like, which can get a bit stale...just authentic, like they are really glad to see me! I love its services, from its juice bar, to its little shop on site, to all the different types of classes: acupuncture, healing sessions, meditation, AND yoga...it's all my favorite things in one spot! And the people there are just a joy to spend time with; everyone is completely engaged, and I always see everyone smiling!

I was fortunate enough to utilize Spiga to cater a small work event.  I could not have been happier!  Derik was so accommodating and so polite.  He made substitutions as necessary, and when I asked him to work within a specific dollar amount per person, we were still able to taste a number of things from the menu.  And the taste was magnificent!  My colleagues were so happy and so impressed!  I would DEFINITELY consider Spiga again for a future event!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Sorso!  I had my most recent Birthday Party there, and I could not have been happier!  I reserved the small area at the back for me and my 16 guests, and it was just perfect, not separated from the rest of the restaurant, yet private enough so that we would not disturb others.  The area was prepared in advance, the food was brought promptly, and glass...after glass...after glass...was delivered with a big smile. (I now have a secret crush on David.) So much deliciousness.  I know, Winos don't use the word, "Deliciousness," but who cares?  Totally dug the contemporary swank design.  And the best part?  I was given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco for celebrating my birthday at Sorso.  I will be back!  I will definitely be back!

I like the novelty. I like the flexibility: coworkers, family, friends, kids...a fun activity that you can complete in a couple of hours together...have a couple drinks together beforehand, or not. And our Staff Member (I think his name is Jason) was really enthusiastic and helpful. If I recommend it to friends and strangers, it's a "5."
