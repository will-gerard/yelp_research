So me and some  friend went to this I hop today. I have the worst service I have ever had in my life. My friend had to wait about 20 more minutes for his food to come while we had ours ready. I had to remind the waiter that there was still an order missing. He brought it right away so we could tell it had been ready all along. He just forgot it. He didn't ask my other friend what kind of sauce she would like for her chicken. He didn't bring us syrup for our pancakes until much later. It felt like he wasn't all there. The wrost thing that happened was he didn't let us pay at the front so we could all split our tabs. Because of this,  he confused our payments and i ended up paying more than i should have. He was unprofessional and seemed like it was his first day at the job. I think he shouldve comped one of the meals to make up for the mistakes. Me and my friends are not satisfied with that waiter and it has made us not want to go to that location anymore.

this is my favorite chinese place to go so far. its cheap, local, and the food is awesome but its a regular old restaraunt. my favorite is the restaraunts special: a big ass plate of pork, chicken, and shrimp with carrots, water chestnuts, and some other vegetables that taste gross by themselves but irresistable with this plate. the order takers are two chinese ladies who are kind of hard to understand but like i say at all restaraunts: take ur time and make sure u know what u want. everything will go smoothly after that. what sucks is that theres not alot of drink choices but i like that they have alot of juices for the lil ones if you dont like them drinking soda. i love az iced tea. best time to come is lunch when they have all their specials on. if youre lookin for a chinese restaraunt, dont even thinki twice. jus go to happy food on 67th ave and thomas.

I have been to this club a bunch of times with my friends. Its got ok music. A lot of guys are jumpy. Almost got jumped one time. The drinks are ok before ten. Bud lites are 4 for a dollar before ten which i like but they get pricey afterwards. Oh and theres alot of black people there. Wednesday nites are the nites i go cuz my girlfriends get in for free. Thats rite ladies nite. The nicest bartender there is the lady with the long dark hair. The girls at the entrance just sell beer. Theres karaoke on the far side of the bar. Looks fun. Its ur typical club i guess. If u want a guy threatening you. Wethere ur a girl or a guy.

this place is the best for pizza and wings! they have a special for a large pizza and 25 wings for like 20 bucks. its pricey but its worth it. its a little restaraunt next to the wal mart on northern and 59 ave. they have a tv there whhere they usually put sports on. the staff is really friendly and one of the employees even took it to me instead of just calling me up. so nice! i think im gunna go today. dam u lunas pizza and ur deliciousness! dam youuuuuuu!
