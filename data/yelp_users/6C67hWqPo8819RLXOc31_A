***WARNING TO ALL BRIDES - This Is Not The Bridal Shop You Are Looking For*** My appointment at Azteca Bridal was so bad that not only will I not be a returning customer anymore but will never recommend the shop to any other bride again. I have been a customer of Azteca Bridal since high school and what I experienced the other day was absolute chaos and frustration. We walked in and had to wait by the front desk area for over 30 minutes. We were not allowed to go upstairs and look at any dresses until we were given a consultant but once we got a consultant she was gone from us within 5 minutes. She barely spoke English, kept talking to us in Spanish as if we spoke the language, and did not help us one bit. She told us to go through the rooms with the gowns, pick whichever dress we wanted and then put them on a rack with my name on it. She then left us to help attend 2 other girls in the dressing rooms. She did not tell us that not all the dresses were available in my size, nor did she tell me that the rooms were divided into different price ranges, and she didn't help us pull dresses or ask me anything about the wedding or what my budget was. We thought we would pick the dresses we liked then she would go and find my size in the dress. Instead she put all the dresses in a little fitting room with curtains that kept opening while I was changing and sat my family in the ugly and cheap chairs you can see in the pictures other people have posted here. They are cheap office chairs and the dressing rooms and mirrors are dirty. The consultant did not help me in or out of the dress. My sister had to figure out how to tie the corsets on her own. The consultant would open the curtains wide when entering and exiting the little room which exposed me to all the people in the chairs while I was changing. I had no privacy and no help. When I finally got the first dress on the consultant had me stand on an old plastic stool and in front of dirty mirrors and horrible lighting. The place has almost no windows and is very dark with cheap lighting. Out of the 6-7 dresses I chose I was only able to try on 3-4 because the consultant was too busy with other brides. For dresses marked up on average $1000+ I expected way better customer service, clarity, and help. The dresses upstairs are all bunched together, extremely dirty and worn. They have jewels missing, buttons torn off, black scuffs on all the bottoms, and are a complete mess. The store and staff were very unorganized and the shop itself feels cheap and overpriced. The only thing my consultant did to help me was take out dresses I did not like or did not fit me and tell me horrendous add on expenses to the dresses. She told me it would be at least $300-500 for my alterations on almost any of the dresses and was going to charge me over $300 for a belt that was used, dirty, but matched the dress. She never offered to order in any of the dresses I tried on. Either the dress fitted or didn't. There was no other option. At the end of the appointment when I told her we would not be purchasing the dress today her demeanor got extremely rude and frustrated. She wrote down the two dresses I "liked" on a form, walked us immediately downstairs and had us talk to the front desk lady about picking a dress immediately and paying for the alterations right away. Once we said we would be coming back in a day or two to make the final, in a way they wanted no more to do with us. They got us out of the room and downstairs to make way for another. The front desk lady kept telling us they did not have enough time to alter my dress if I did not decide at that moment or the next day. I was frustrated, embarrassed, upset, and disappointed. Instead of assistance or care in any part of the store my family and I were neglected and pushed aside. I left Azteca wanting to never put on a wedding dress again. When going to try on wedding dresses I knew it would be stressful and difficult but not upsetting, gross, embarrassing, and frustrating. I will never be returning to Azteca ever again after what I went through.

I was in a hurry to find a salon that could give me an all over color before I had to go on vacation. All other salons open around 10pm but I had work at 1pm and didn't want to risk being late. I looked on Yelp for salons and found Beauty Brands! They opened at 8am and were able to get me in that morning at no problem right away. I had Sydney as my stylist and he did an amazing job! I got the color and cut I wanted and everyone at my work was blown away with it all! I was very impressed with the place itself and the other stylists that were there. These are professionals that know what their doing and really take care of their clients. I have definitely found my new "go to" salon. I am extremely happy with their work and help. Thank you Beauty Brands!

Awesome pizza that really made my night. It was made perfectly and tasted delicious. I used the Domino's Tracker and it worked very accurately. Through the app I was able to see when and where my pizza was and submit feedback on my experience. I will definitely be ordering from this location again.

Although the customer service was top notch and the atmosphere more elegant than that of Olive Garden, the food and drinks were subpar. We ordered a half loaf of garlic-cheese bread to start and were given 4 very small biscotti sized bread sticks. The actual bread that comes with the meal is far more massive and delicious than that which was ordered. For a drink I got the Tagliani Margarita that was ok but quite plain for a margarita. I was expecting a more fruity and stronger taste but the amount of ice in the drink really watered it down. Next came the cesar salad that had a sour taste dressing. I was dying to get my main dish (a big plate of raviolis with alfredo sauce) and was greatly disappointed! I was given a giant plate but with only 4 (again FOUR) raviolis that were just a bit bigger than a silver dollar coin. The rest of the plate was covered in alfredo sauce to make it look filled. I was not only shocked but very hungry. I finished my food before my fianc√© even started digging into his own plate. He got the Steak Gorgonzola that tasted plain and the sauce was very soupy. He and I were not satisfied with the food and not filled one bit unfortunately.

Tonight was my first time at Maggiano's and after tonight it is my new favorite Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is divine and the service absolutely superb. We were warmly welcomed by our server who attended to us hand and foot and were given amazing bread and oil to begin with. Our server made sure our bread basket was full all night and refilled our drinks without any hesitation right before we took our last sip. We ordered the raviolis, zidi, chicken, and my little brother ordered from the kids menu. All of our food was prepared beautifully and including the kids plate. We all shared from each other and loved every dish. When we ordered dessert our server gave us all new silverware, napkins, and plates. We ate the dessert sampler and it was not only well priced but tasted amazing. We were given 5 samples of the different desserts offered and loved every single one. I am a very picky eater and surprisingly loved every sample given. The staff was especially curdious towards my little brother and even gave him a little personal bag of bread to take home. The service was better than expected and the food wonderful. Richard, our server, was the best and I hope to have him again when I return.

I was very happy with the customer service and professionalism with this location. Everyone was nice and exceptional. They kept checking in with me to make sure I didn't need anything. They went through lines quick and easy and made sure we didn't feel unattended. I didn't have an appointment - just a walk in but got my tires air checked and rotated in under an hour. They did a phenomenal job and I was very impressed. I will definitely be coming here again for any tire needs.

The Torrid Store in the Arrowhead Mall is one of my favorite places in the mall to buy jeans and office clothes for girls curvy like me. The staff is absolutely wonderful, helpful, and honest when it comes to the clothes. During their previous promotion I was able to get 3 pairs of their high-end pants for $80. They are stretchy but strong and after several washes already still feel as new as when I first purchased them. I cannot say enough about the staff though! They are just too nice and sweet. They always take care of me and make me feel confident and beautiful!

They made me the perfect wedding cake! They made it simple but elegant and kept true to my Beauty and the Beast theme. I was so pleased with their work, especially on such short notice. The shop itself is adorable and cute. The staff is very friendly and excited to help with any event. They made a true work of art for me!

A delightful place with a unique feature. The revolving bar goes around the tables and allows customers to take what they want when they want it. Kiku Sushi allows you to choose the sushi you want without having to order and entire plate of 6-8 pieces. You pick up the plate from the bar which gives you 2-6 pieces of sushi per plate. There is less chance of you wasting the food and a better chance of you to get only what you love and try new things. The service is friendly and helpful. They all take great care of the customer. Another great thing is that of your sushi gets taken up by other patrons you can always just ask the waitress to have the chef make you your order instead of waiting for the dish to come around. They really want to make sure everyone has a great and filling experience.

She has years of experience and it shows. If you want a great set of nails ask for Kasey! This salon is sure to be a top spot in upcoming months.

A great establishment with an awesome theme. My boyfriend enjoys the shampoo and hot towel treatment. It's clean and organized with a friendly staff and cool atmosphere. The giant TVs everywhere make sure everyone has a view of the games and makes the appointment go by fast. A great place to get a hair cut and catch up on the game ^_^

So we had a great time the first time. This last time however (which will be the last unfortunately) was really bad. It is never busy but they rushed my friend in and out in maybe 10 minutes. The stylist that did my friend's hair (who shall remain nameless) did a poor quality cut and also CUT my friend on the neck. She did not shave his neck well and left waves instead of a fade. I have to now try and fix what should have been an easy military cut. I am very shocked at the experience we had today and am sad that we will be unable to come back the the establishment because the time we had there was hurtful in many ways.

I have tried many different nail salons in the area but I am very impressed with the services and employees at the Lish Nail Salon. I walked in and they greeted me with open arms and made me feel comfortable. I had rounded sparkle nails before that were crooked and bumpy. Leo was able to re-straighten and make them sharper which is what I exactly wanted. My pedicure was wonderful and well worth the price. I was also surprised about the cleanliness and health procedures they do at the salon. I am very happy with my new nails! They take their time and are very friendly. I highly recommend this salon.

After a month of work and play my nails held up immensely and I am happy to have them redone after so long for Valentines Day! Leo was able to change the color from black to pearl pink in just a quick sitting and I am very pleased! The customer service is phenomenal and you couldn't step into a more cleaner shop. Thank you again Lish Nail Salon.

Although the location of Tresa Apartments is in a prime spot that is all that I found to be a pro in living here. My husband and I only stayed here for 6 months and that was bad enough. From day one it was downhill. Our apartment was not move in ready and we were not allowed to see the apartment ahead of time. There were so many things wrong inside that I gave the front desk a packet of photos of everything that needed to be fixed. They never offered to change our apartment but merely stated that everything in the packet would get fixed ASAP. The front desk lady told me "well you know your not the first person to live in this apartment right?" -as if I didn't know what.   The first month of us staying here the **SWAT Team and DEA** blew off the door to our upstair's neighbor's apartment at 5am and scared the life out of us. They then proceeded to search the apartment next to them and ours. Apparently our neighbor was wanted for many outstanding warrants. The management did nothing for us even though we were scared and uncomfortable in the complex. They said they did not have the ability to check everyone's background that they rented to and that things happen.... The next month my husband was in a hit-and-run accident in the complex by one of the residents. We took the license plate number, a description of what the person looked like, and told them the building they lived in - they stated they would go to the owners and get their insurance information for us - nothing was ever done. We filled a police report which helped us to get their insurance information.   Our fridge from day one would shake and make a loud knocking sound periodically throughout the day. After 6 months of work order forms and complaining it still never got fixed. Only about 50% of everything on our packet got fixed by the time we moved out. Almost every month something new and unbelievable would happen in our apartment from the carpet coming undone, ant infestations, mechanical problems with appliances, neighbor disturbances, and work order assistance. I placed in many work order forms while living here at Tresa not for a lot of different problems by the same old problems that never got fixed. The issues either got done weeks later or not at all. When they came to inspect the fridge in November the maintenance man took the fridge out of the wall and ripped off DUCK TAPE from its back. A plastic piece came flinging off of the fridge. The man told me, "well we can just fix this an it should be fine" - I told him I wanted it replaced because it was being held together with duck tape. He stated he could but in an order to have it replaced but it would take a couple weeks to get a new one. I said fine and never heard back from them. Before leaving, the property manager stated we were being overcharged each month of rent by over $40! Had we not moved out and had them go over our files we would still be living there paying $40 extra a month for nothing.   We were told, after everything we experienced, we would be getting our security deposit back - we received a letter in the mail just a couple days ago that they used our security deposit for "maintenance" and "cleaning purposes" for moving out expenses. I have photos of how spotless and beautiful I left the apartment and they claimed certain things still needed to be done. The day before moving out I asked the front desk lady if I needed to do anything or pay anything before we left - she said, "No that's it. We are really sorry for everything you've had to go through here and we hope you have a better experience at your next complex. Just don't leave any trash inside the apartment and you should be receiving your security deposit in a week".....this was at the beginning of December. It's been over a month. I am done with this place.

If I could give this bridal shop a 10 star rating I would. I went into Luv Bridal from another bridal store that I had the utmost worst experience you could imagine. I was beaten down, frustrated, upset, and on the verge of tears. I was literally driving by the shop and their dresses in the window caught my eye. I told myself I would just take a peak but not try on anything. I was so done with the day I just wanted to look and leave. A young lady graciously greeted me and had me fill out a simple quick form in regards to when the wedding day was (in 21 days), what dress style I liked (anything that fits size 12+), and how I heard about them (by driving past the window). The owner Helen talked to me, greeted me, and walked me down the rows of dresses writing down which ones I wanted to try on. She was able to immediately tell me what she had on my size and not. An amazing aspect about this shop is that the dresses are NOT all bunched together, all the sizes are NOT all just placed on the floor, and the dresses are hung high so they do not get dirty. They don't have 500+ dresses just lying around and squished in-between one another. They are evenly spaced for easy visibility and observation. After the owner was done writing down my favorites I was introduced to my wedding consultant Alexa. Alexa completely turned my day around. She was excited, happy, and warm. She went in the back, got all my favorite dresses and was beyond helpful. I was so upset about trying the dresses on but with her help and kind words I went in the room and I kid you not - fell in love with the first dress I put on. I was walked out into the presentation area and got to see myself in large beautiful mirrors with my family comfortably sitting on couches with refreshments. Luv was a complete 360 from the previous shop I was at. They took carafe us and treated us like family, and not customer family but actual family. Alexa complimented me throughout the appointment, helped me in and out of my dress, hung my dresses for me, laced me up comfortably in each dress, and picked out the perfect matching veils with each dress I tried on. Even though I fell in love with the first dress and ended up getting it I wanted to just "confirm the zombie kill" as Alexa called it and tried on 4 other dresses. If I had asked her to try on 10, 30, 100 dresses I wouldn't have mind and would have taken care of me the same way the entire time. Although other shops in the area are iconic due to their longevity in the business I feel as though they are loosing their love for the business, their customer service, and overall care for the bride. This is not the case at Luv Bridal. I will refer all who I can to this establishment. They may be new to the United States and the Valley but they know what we Arizona women are looking for both style, price, and customer service wise. Words cannot describe how happy and confident I am about my purchase with Luv Bridal. IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND I SAID "YES" TO MY DRESS HERE AT LUV BRIDAL AND FORMAL!

This shop is 10x better than Great Clips or any other salon/barber in the area. They have unbeatable prices, great customer service, and a very professional shop and atmosphere. Everyone smiles when you walk in and greets you as if you are a regular. They shaved the side of my head and did a great job! I also had Sydney do a design on the side as well. I gave him free-range to do whatever he wanted and he did a fantastic job (photo is soon to be posted). He aligned my hair and used his razor and scissors with precision. I am very very happy with the service and haircut I received. I will probably only be going to them for now on for all my hair needs. They also do women's cuts, colors, shaves, and give a military discount. I highly recommend checking them out.
