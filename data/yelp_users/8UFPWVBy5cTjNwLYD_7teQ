This is my go to nail salon because they do such an excellent job with the gel polish.  This particular time however, an older lady did my nails. She filed the top of them leaving them scratched and very thin. The finished product looked like something I would try to do at home.  Unfortunately, after 5 happy years of going here, I won't be coming back.   Also, the arm massage at the end was so painful that I had to tell her to stop. My arm was red along the bone and muscle areas. I'm pretty sure I will have bruises.

This is my go to nail salon because they do such an excellent job with the gel polish.  Just make sure that you don't go to the very old lady.

Awesome coffee and tea. Awesome employees and treats.   One thing that's awkward are the mass amount of creepy old men. Really creepy.   Eeeeh

Terrible.  Don't go here. The male check out clerk was super rude. Everything was overpriced. Low quality. Never going back.

Fair prices, odd hours.  Cats everywhere. I won't be coming back. I came to pick up my car and nobody was there... Door was locked. Nobody answered my calls. I had to call out of work for the day.

Go to the dudes, because the lady who I had to deal with seemed to be very uninterested in helping me.  It was like pulling teeth to get an answer of the price difference between ground and air delivery.  She couldn't even recommend the right size box for my package.  I felt as if I was being judged by my every move.

I will drive an hour out of my way just to get my hair done by Jinia Root!  She is simply the best.  She has a creative eye and know what styles work with the right shaped faces.    She cut and colored my hair.  My cut was fantastic and my color was the best I've ever had.  Make sure you go to her!! :)

Terrible service.  Don't go to this location.  After waiting patiently for about 20 mins for water, we kindly left.

The vermicelli dishes are bomb and the staff is awesome.

Chef Johnny Chu does it again.  Every dish that our table ordered was outstanding. Make sure you get the hot and sour soup, the tofu spring rolls in rice paper, and the Papaya duck mint salad. For the wok dishes, I suggest the Hong Kong flat rice, Black Dragon, House Dynamite, sizzling shrimp, or the spicy basil. They are all good! :)

I was really disappointed with the menu. I like vegetarian options, but this is a vegetarian restaurant without healthy options. The one savory dish that looked appealing was chili with cornbread. It's pretty hard to mess that up. However, the cornbread was way too sweet.  It was either a pumpkin spice or honey cornbread. The jackfruit sliders were gross. If you have had fresh jackfruit before, do not get this dish. We also had the nachos.  They were the worst.
