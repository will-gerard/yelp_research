As a long time customer of Budget Movers, I continue to be completely satisfied. The crew that moved me 2 years ago, is still with this company and once again were exceptionally professional, extremely careful with all my household items.  My expectations were exceeded and I will definitely call them in about a month when its time to move my items out of storage into my new home.

As always a delicious meal, special menu for Restaurant Week was perfect and an awesome price point.  But best of all was the "visiting" server Kristie Schwarz!  Too bad she's not permanent, but will look her up if I go to Seasons 52 in Colorado!

This is 3rd home since 2010 that Justin has installed an awesome home entertainment system in. . He is absolutely genius and really cares customers are 100% satisfied. I love having both TV, components and streaming options all on one remote. Justin and Jeremy are very trustworthy. The smartest thing they've done is hiring Kristin to professional manage their busy volume of clients. I would not trust anyone else.

I gave them one star for the young lady who was very new to the industry that certainly made every efforts to accommodate in spite of those she reports to.  We selected the car for a cash purchase and CLEARLY stated we did not want ANY after market warranties.  And YET they blatantly disregarded this and pitched this nonsense, and still shoved $399 for "options" down our throats.  They failed to disclose there was only one key until the deal was done stating the car was as is.  It was the most annoying experience and they made NO EFFORT to provide any compensation or considerations for our purchase of a car that was on their lot for less than 24 hours. It was a circus that involved being trapped for unnecessarily long periods of time, and it was pathetic that no employee seemed to know the fax # for our insurance to send our coverage.    We drove away with an empty tank, literally, and feeling no love as a customer.  I will be calling to try and cancel that $399 "OPTIONS" so we can buy the 2nd key for my 80 year mother's car, at a cost of $280!  Definitely will not be back and would not recommend them. Oh and apparently they are prone to "losing" the 2nd key...as I read other Yelp reviews of their dismal customer service!

Just made a 2nd appointment for my 2 pups, their 1st was exceptional! They never looked or SMELLED better.  They loved being there, were happy to hang out and shop and get treats afterwards.  Doggy Daze also donated a gift card and a t-shirt for The 4th Annual Heart and Soul Rock Party to benefit congenital heart kids attending a special camp.    Only wish they had day-care, I'd sign mine up in a heart beat!  LoveIAM
