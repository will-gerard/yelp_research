Came here with an older friend of mine (Rick) on a friday night. Got here aound midnight and the crowd was in full swing. Love the open air bar and the seating outside was very enjoyable to escape the masses of people inside. Something very interesting happened to me on this night that I need to share. My friend went to the bathroom and I was left kinda standing at one of the bar tables doing some people watching and drinking at same time. A lady came up to me and grabbed my hand. She said "Pretend that you know me"...so I abliged and acted like I knew who she was. She said she was with a guy but had to come over and talk to me! She opened my hand and put a piece of paper in my hand saying that she wanted me to call her. I loked over her shoulder and noticed this poor sap at a nearby table kinda looking my way. I felt bad for him so I took the paper, said good bye to the lady and watched her as she walked back to him. My friend Rick came back and I said " your never going to believe it but....."  Now the real kicker is that Rick is single and dying to meet a girl. The look oh his face was priceless! To make a long story short I gave him the phone number and told him to call. He proceeded to call her literally as we left the club. I was laughing so hard that I didnt notice him saving her number to his phone. Fast forward a few days to find out that he called this girl atleast 10 times in 2 days! She finally said that she wanted to meet me and not him. So goes the story of Rick's life! Classic!

Great gym with some great equipment and a lot of room so it doesn't feel cramped. The locker rooms were in great shape and the staff was very friendly. The membership price is very reasonable and makes Pure Fitness one of the best deals in the Valley.

Stopped by Bliss a few times when I was with a few friends who were in town for business. Each time we went there were different girls there so its hard to say the best time to go. They get crowded friday and saturday the bartenders said but we would mainly go after work on a friday. They actually had a very good Flank steak dinner for $5! I was very impressed and so were my friends. It was good enough to make me go back!  I would have to say if I was there 4 times I might have seen one girl each time that was hot enough to get a lap-dance from. Most of them were average and some were just not attractive or their bodies were not in shape. Overall this place is good for a quick trip to down a few beers and enjoy a dance or two but the "talent" is hit or miss.

I heard alot about this place through Yelp so when I came across it I decided to give it a try. I didnt know that they were more of a luncheonette type place. I ordered a medium hot coffee and try a glaxed donut. The coffee tasted like it was burnt and the donut wassoft but just didnt taste right. It almost seemed like the glaze was bad or something. Either way I was not impressed with Rainbow Donuts and will continue to go to Dunkin Donuts since no one can seem to match their amazing coffee! (and donuts too!)

great food and the service was excellent. I was surprised at how cheap the price was when the bill finally came. I know MExican food rlaly fills you up but we left there very satisfied and we were not broke! We will definately be back.

Came here late night after partying at Devil's Martini nearby. The atmosphere was fun as about 15 semi-drunk patrons all congregated for some late night carbs! Our server was busting his hump at 2am and was working hard so kudos to him! The food was good as always. I can eat breakfast food at anytime so I'm always a fan.

Went to Chase field this baseball season to see the DBacks vs the Padres. Great pitching matchup of Jake Peavy vs Brandon Webb. Well the game turned out to be high-scoring as it was home run galore so that was fun. We had amazing seats as a friend of mine got a hook up with the team and so we scored seats right behind the AZ dugout first row! We were able to put our drinks and food right on the dugout roof! The players were all about 10 feet away from us when they stood up or walked onto the field. We ate food behind home plate in the little sports bar they have down there. The service was good but everything was very pricey (to be expected at any sporting event). I dd love the selection of the food and drink choices at the park though. It would be nice if they had a Dunkin Donuts coffee stand but I keep forgetting that I am on the west coast! Overall a great time and great place to watch a game.

Great place to get some great food! Love the ambiance and atmosphere that this place offers. Can get a little pricey if you go nuts like we do but its nice to indulge every now and than. Nightlife is very good too as the live music and bar crowd are top notch. This place is a must visit!

Good atmosphere and decent sandwiches but once again HORRIBLE iced coffee. Can anyone do it right besides Dunkin Donuts? Im trying to so hard to find another good iced coffee store but no one can compare to D&D yet.

Stopped by this KK as I was passing by to see what the "new" stores would be like and once again I was very disappointed. Im a huige fan of the hot, moist glazed donut but it was no where to be found! The donuts they had seem like day-old donuts. Forget the coffee in Krispy Kreme as it tastes like gas station coffee. Very dry anhd bland. Im a huge Dunkin coffee addict as you can tell but Krispy Kreme has really gone downhill and these stores that are re-opening I dont think will last long since everyone who goes to one all says the same thing: Donuts are not what they used to be!

I stopped by the new Krispy Kreme at 7th & Roosevelt this past saturday and bought a coffee and a couple donuts, just to check it out.  We went to the science museum downtown, so we drove right by it twice.   It was pretty dead both times (1 & 4pm).   They didn't do much to change the interior sinec it was REV coffee, kept most of the TI's that were already in place.  Coffee was okay, not bad per se, but just typical convenience type coffee. It was very hot when served (too hot).   Compared it with the Dunkin Donuts decaf that we later got, DD was of course better.   Out of their 2 donuts, one was too "fried".  DD won on donuts too!

I am going to have to disagree with the other reviewer on the Egg White Veggie Flatbread as my girl and I think it is really good. I do agree with you that if you do not eat it within the first 10min it gets cold but if you consume it within that time it is VERY good. The flatbread is wholewheat and Dunkin says the whole thing is 300 calories.   According to the national taste test Dunkin BEAT Starbucks so the shirts are not only funny but TRUE! I used to pay the absurd $5 for the Frappa Mocha Latte-chino or whatever it was that I used to get. It was like 1000 calories with all the toppings and way too expensive. Now that Dunkin popping up all over Phoenix I can see why Starbucks is getting nervous.   For the best tasting coffee (and value!)  in town everyone now knows to go to Dunkin.
