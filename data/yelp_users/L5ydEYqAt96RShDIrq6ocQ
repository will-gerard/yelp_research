I absolutely love this yoga studio.  There isn't a teacher there I don't like.  The ambiance is fantastic and the price is just right. If you don't live in the area it's still worth the drive.    After class enjoy a latte or snack in the cafe. Bring a book and sit on the patio it's gorgeous there.

I don't care what anybody says, you get what you pay for and since the produce here is super cheap sometimes that means it's not going to be top notch BUT who cares?!  You can fill a whole cart with whatever you need for about $30 and I mean your cart is totally filled to the top.  We actually stopped juicing for a while b/c produce is so expensive, since we've found this place we can juice all we want.  It's true that most of the produce won't last longer then a week but when you're paying .15 for 4 onions who cares?    Here's a tip for you Saturday shoppers - don't do it, I've actually seen fights break out in line on Saturday mornings.   If you must then bring a shopping buddy and have them stand in line while you do the shopping - by the time you're done they'll be at check out. Also skip the carts and bring some cloth bags. You'll be able to weave in and out of the crowds easily and get your shopping done super fast.

The is the best Italian food I've tasted that didn't come from my grandma's kitchen. I recommend the gnocchi Gorgonzola but everything is amazing here. All the pasta is made from scratch daily and the sauces have the most amazing flavor.  Don't leave w/o trying the Tiramisu.  The ambiance is super cute and the service is top notch.

I just switched to this vet after having several horrible experiences with Alta Mesa Animal Hospital and I am so happy I did! What a great group.  The employees are smart and great with my animal.  The pricing is reasonable and the facilities are clean and comforting.  My dog was totally as ease receiving the same procedures that seemed to really upset him at his old vet.  I would recommend this hospital to anyone

I really felt like I needed to update my old review about Bark Ave. I continue to be so overly impressed by this vet!  It's so refreshing to find a place that doesn't try to gouge you every visit and really loves your animal.  My Meatball is a little accident prone so unfortunately we have a lot of experience with vets and recently he scratched his eyeball (I don't know how, don't ask).  Anyhoo something that I thought would take a few days to heal turned into a 2 month fiasco.  Throughout the entire process the doctors and techs at Bark Ave were so great and really worked with my schedule since we were taking him in so often for checkups. We left the country in the middle of his care and they went to the place we boarded him (Bark Ave Pet Resort also super awesome) several times that week to make sure he was ok and still have his meds.  When he finally healed they were as excited as we were. Further they didn't charge me every time I walked in the door which really saved us a lot of money. I can't say enough about the quality, affordable care they give.

This is the 2nd time I've been to this place. The first time was in their old location and we had a pretty bad experience and then we went again since they've moved and not much else has changed.  Welcome to death's waiting room ladies and gentleman! (hold for trumpets)  First of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit.  Once seated expect to continue to wait forever for your food. We decided to sit at the breakfast bar where you have full access to the kitchen window, this was probably the best part of our experience - talk about entertainment. The waitresses are constantly stressed and do they bitch and moan- totally unprofessional.   After about 30 min. of watching "the kitchen window movie" we realized that we still hadn't gotten our food (we ordered simple dishes: 2 egg/hashbrowns  and I got a side of cinnamon bun french toast).    The person sitting next to us who came in long after was already eating.  When I asked what the deal was she said his meal was super simple that's why he got his before us. "You two ordered omeletes right?" Umm no we didn't...oh and  wait, stop, hold up...let me get this straight so people who order biscuits and gravy and french toast get to eat before people who order eggs and french toast? Well ok I'll make sure to get that next time then! Now that we know the secret our experience should be much better.  We finally got our food after 40 min and it was wrong.  (boo! I'm starving!)   After going through all of that the food was just ok. The homefries are good but the rest was sub par.  The "homemade" cinnamon roll they used for the french toast was chewy and dry and the ham my husband ordered looked a lot like spam meat to me.  After all the waiting and drama this place just isn't worth it.    I should note that our waitress was very nice and did a pretty good job even though she was slammed but I bet it was b/c we were literally  sitting in her face at the breakfast bar and even in that location we never got a refill on our waters or coffee...ok so never mind she wasn't good either.  She did comp some of my meal which was a nice gesture though I would have demanded that if she didn't offer anyway.  Additional Tip: For all you omelete eaters out there, they cook them then microwave them before they're served. I'm really not a fan of microwaved eggs so I thought I'd pass that nugget along.  Sitting in front of the Kitchen window can certainly be enlightening...and gross.

We went to the Salt Cellar for our wedding anniversary and I really liked this place.  The ambiance was great, the concept of putting the restaurant underground is clever  The service was great, and I think the pricing was reasonable for the quality of the food.    I had the Alaskan King Crab with the filet.  A filet is a filet almost anywhere you go so it was good.  The crab was for sure above average.  My husband got the stuffed lobster tail with the filet and the stuffed lobster was the best I've ever tasted.   They gave us a free dessert b/c we were celebrating our anniversary so we ordered the amaretto cheesecake....ah-may-zing.  Expect to spend around $150 for the meal if you don't order an appetizer but for a nice dinner out it's worth every penny.  We'll return to the Salt Cellar for sure.

I don't know what the other ladies in these earlier reviews are talking about. Although if you read the reviews of other nail salons you'll likely see the same annoying rants about walk ins vs. appts. Let me assure you that the majority of the ladies that live in this area don't even work so they shouldn't be so distraught over the additional 15 min they had to wait. I'm sure their massage therapist will understand, it's the day in the life of a housewife after all, never a dull moment. But I digress...   I love, love, love this place. I get regular pedicures and also they wax my eyebrows. Each of the ladies who have provided services on me have done an amazing job. I love the vibe of the salon and the prices are just right. They are stringent about quality control. The owner will check to make sure my pedicure is perfect and if she doesn't think it is, she has them redo the polish or the design if needed. All of the women are super nice and you can beat the massage chairs. I would recommend to anybody!

So this place is near my office and every time we have a new employee we drag them to this nightmare.  The pasta dishes are the only thing I've had on the menu that are decent and I can recommend some much better Italian food if that's what you're looking for.  Today's adventure was their Rueben...it was almost totally inedible. The meat was good but the bread was hard and over all the sandwich was super dry.  It's not inexpensive to eat there so I would expect the food to be better. The thing I dislike the most about this place is that it literally takes 2 hours to complete lunch, the service is HORRIBLE.  Do not bother coming here.

I've stayed at MGM Signature but this was my first time staying at the MGM Grand.  I love the Signature and I would recommend their suites over the MGM but if you do decide to stay at the MGM Grand here's a little warning I wish somebody would have told me. We booked a Jack Pot deal through Southwest. We got a West Wing King. So we arrive at the hotel and check in and begin walking to our room and about 10 minutes later we finally reach the doors entering the west wing. All of a sudden we felt like we were in a college dorm. The carpet was grimy the walls gray concrete The rooms have no view and they're extremely hot. Apparently the air-conditioning doesn't work in the dungeon.  Not ideal for sure but we could have made it work if it didn't take what felt like 30 minutes to get from the lobby to our room!! This place is HUGE so from our room to the pool would have been like half a days journey. We paid some ridiculous upgrade rate to move our room to the Grand Tower just so we wouldn't spend the whole weekend walking back and forth. This is one of those hikes where if your left your phone in the room you'd just say screw it.  2nd issue for me was the staff. There were at least two pit bosses and 4 dealers that literally made me want to leave tables.  I've never had so many people scold me for my hand placement or talking loudly with my friends. Apparently being a little rowdy in Vegas is now illegal? There were some dealers that were a lot of fun but overall I would rate the staff at MGM at a 6 out of 10  There are much better places to stay in Vegas and for sure better places to gamble.  One positive thing I want to make sure to throw in. We rented a cabana on the pool and was very reasonably priced. 800 min food and drink spend. Our waiter Joey was the best. Plus once Calvin Harris came on at Wet Republic they played it over their sound system. We had the best seat in the house. One of my top 5 pool days in Vegas

You'd think that in a state like Arizona that you could throw a rock 10 feet and find great Mexican food. This is NOT true unfortunately. I've been searching for truly great Mexican food for two years and Ive finally found it!  Not only is the food fantastic but the ambiance can't be beat. The patio is gorgeous, and there are several different rooms and each has it's own look and feel. If you don't want to sit in you can get take out. There's a separate building in the parking lot that handles only carry out orders.  It's not the cheapest place but it's worth every penny

So I actually love, love, love the food here BUT on multiple occasions they have failed in operations and service. Today was the last straw I had to write a review. I called to order a pizza they said a minimum of 2 hours for delivery, we said we'll pick it up, they said over an hour!! I asked what was going on, they said they RAN OUT OF PIZZA! On Sunday you managed to run out of product? This is not the first issue I've had with this location. On  another occasion they lost my order all together. After over an hour I called to follow up only to find out they couldn't locate it. They've been late on more then one occasion. I don't care how good your pizza might be, if you can't deliver it in a reasonable time or at all for that matter I'll have to take my business elsewhere. At the prices you charge, I'd expect more consistency in your operations. Let's at least figure out how to keep dough in stock, shall we?

Ladies and gentleman if you've been looking for a great laser treatment center look no further. Run, don't walk to Diane! She's professional, knowledgeable, her treatments are almost completely pain free and she's reasonably priced!! I had huge reservations about the pain part myself based on research that I'd done online. The machine clearly makes a difference. Her cold laser technique is effective but also doesn't hurt. I'm so angry I wasted so many years battling hair removal on my own. She's the best, I promise you  won't regret it.

Last  year I had a company come out and do an AC tune up and they recommended over 2k in repairs and maintenance, I didn't think it was necessary so I ignored them and left the air conditioner to run as it was until this year.  I received a card in the mail for Benefit Air to do a tune up for $64. They came out on time, cleaned the unit and inspected it for over an hour.  They said it was in perfect working order and they didn't recommend any maintenance or repairs. The repair man was friendly and informative. I would use them for any repair services in the future.

I know it must be hard to be a coffee company competing in the world with Starbucks and I get the hook this place is trying to pull off BUT here's the deal, you can't be hipster and elitist and the same time.  I tried to order a vanilla latte and I thought that the woman behind the counter was going to stroke out right in front of me.  "We really don't recommend you put flavoring in our coffee" Well I really don't recommend you scold customers when they try to pay for your product. I will drink my coffee however I like it.  I don't need a undereducated, 30 year old barista to tell me how I should drink my lattes.  Sooo if you like over priced coffee BLACK and black only then go on down to Cartel but if you ask for sugar be ready for a berating - don't worry that part is fee they don't charge extra for it.

I don't think anybody can argue that the options for Chinese food in AZ basically suck. If you've ever lived on the east coast and tasted Chinese as it should be done then it's almost unbearable. Red House is the only good Chinese food in this entire state I'm absolutely sure of it.  The delivery fee of $4 is a bit excessive but the food is worth it.  I've never gotten anything from this place that I didn't think was above board. Don't bother going anywhere else.

Now I'm no BBQ connoisseur but I really like this place.  I've tried all the various meats (except the chicken)  and I love them all. They do an amazing job with the ribs which I find isn't always the case for BBQ places in AZ.  Pile on all you can eat sides and the reasonable price and this place is pretty awesome.

I love this place, the food is amazing and the service is the best.  I ate the veggie/tofu stir fry with rice noodles and the vege sprint roll.    I also recommend the Tropical Fruit and shaved ice if you feel like dessert.

I worked out at 1 on 1 boxing for a bout 6 months and I loved it!  The pricing is reasonable although they really should offer a punch card for people who do other types of fitness and won't get much out of the unlimited plan.  They switch out their workouts and always keep you guessing. The workouts are challenging and I saw a significant difference in my body after only 2 months.  If you've never tried boxing I highly recommend it. It's a great alternative to regular cardio/weight training.  I'd still be there right now but w/o air conditioning it's way too hot. I plan to return in the fall though

I hosted a 25 person surprise party at 5th and Wine in December and the staff was amazing! I'd been trying to plan this event for some time and most bars/restaurants were not willing to accommodate a large party without a set menu or minimum spend. 5th and Wine was more then happy to host us. They set us up in the back dining room which was the perfect spot. When my friend was arriving they went around and closed all the curtains so she wouldn't see in. Our waitstaff was on top of it. They did a great job. The food and wine were great as always. Great solution for a large party!

We started coming to Central Mesa Vet about 6 months ago.  Unfortunately they didn't know our pets long before both of them started having issues that caused us to visit quite often. Our bullmastiff was very protective of us but the Dr was very understanding when he would growl and snap, I've noticed that not a lot of vets understand when a dog is simply acting like a dog.  This was huge for us, it really cemented that this vet was the perfect fit for our family.  When we found out our bullmastiff had bone cancer they were really helpful and super caring.  We had to put him down in their office in March and they really helped us through it.  We still have a healthy bulldog and now a new french mastiff and I wouldn't take them anywhere else.

This tanning salon is right in my neighborhood so of course I was excited when I first bought our house and realized that not only was the place not disgusting but the pricing was reasonable.  Well that was until today and some guy who clearly doesn't have a clue purchased the place.   In the past I purchased a 6 tan package for $66 which gave me access to any level bed I wished. So I go in today, and the genius behind the counter stares at the screen for what seemed like 10 minutes and then asked me what package I had. "I don't know dear why don't you just read what's in my file?" She was completely lost. After ages had past and she managed to put two thoughts together she finally realized my package was up.  Ok no problem, here's my credit card. She says "That will be $110" Un excuse me? She said "Yes, it's $110 for 5 sessions." Wait let me get this straight. You're charging me nearly twice as much for fewer sessions? You have to be kidding me? The beds haven't been upgraded, the service is still subpar but just because some greedy dude bought the place you want me to pay almost 2x's the cost. That's adorable. NO I think not. You can't simply charge twice the money for nothing in return. Anybody who pays it is as dumb as the people you have working there. Good luck with the new place buddy - you're going to need it.

So I totally pulled a space cadet move on the online ordering system and ended up with $50 of food for me and my husband but I sent the extra back with the driver and they refunded my money.  GREAT customer service.  The pizza is amazing but everybody already knows that!

I was surprised to read the previous reviews of Mini of Tempe. I had an amazing experience there this weekend.  I'm a leaser so I go through the new car process every two years or so and often it's a total nightmare.  I worked with David Campbell and I would highly recommend him. He was honest and straight forward through the whole process.  It did take a long time for me to meet w/ the finance person b/c there were several people ahead of me so it would have been nice if they had one more person on staff to help w/ that but otherwise I couldn't be happier. P.S. I love my mini and  the price I received on it.  I totally recommend this dealership

After my first service experience at Mini Tempe I'm upping their rating to 5 stars. I could not have been happier w/ the way I was treated.  After only 2 weeks owning the car my tire picked up a nail. Michelle the GM decided to cover it for free!  Auto-inflaters aren't cheap so that was a huge gesture. After offering a free tire they realized it wasn't going to be in stock for a couple of days. they were super apologetic and offered me a rental w/ no fuel charges.  I haven't received service like this since I owned a Lexus. I couldn't be happier w/ this dealership ( and I still love, love, love my Mini).

I've been using this "service" for two years and I kept expecting it to get better but it never has. For some reason that's beyond my understanding they can't seem keep their website up to date based on their current stock.  It seems to me that since the whole premise of this service is that you can order groceries ONLINE that they should at least have the site current.  That's a minor inconvenience unless you're missing the ingredient you need to make your planned meal or you don't have body wash etc.  If you're the type of person who likes to live on edge never knowing if the items you ordered are going to arrive this might be the perfect service for you.  You might even find it exciting!  If so then there you go you can thank me later for the tip.  This is all sort of annoying but wasn't a deal breaker for me, what is a deal breaker is that recently we've occasionally not received our orders at all.  There have been several occasions where they over book their drivers and we don't find out until 10pm that our order won't be arriving or even once their system accidentally deleted my entire order.  Keep in mind that if you want to schedule a redelivery the next day (and you have a job so you need an evening appt) you'll need to allow them a 4 hour window to fit you in which means if you had plans that evening their shot. All of sudden this service that is supposed make my life so much easier is more of a hassle then driving to the store. I would avoid it.  Maybe one day they'll figure it out or better yet maybe Fry's will get on board and do it right. That'd be nice.  Oh PS their customer service call center sucks

Ok I'll admit it, I'm am totally adverse to going into grocery stores, I absolutely hate doing it so I figured hey why not try out Safeway's home delivery service again, maybe they've improved.  They totally have!  They're rarely  if ever out of items that I've ordered, they're now offering more items then before, the drivers are all super courteous and always on time! YAY!  Here's a tip - purchase 5 items from the "Get Free delivery banner" on the homepage.  As long as there items in the list you need it's nice to save on the delivery charge.

Un-Believe-Able.  I could not have been happier with this photographer. Unfortunately I didn't know about them before I got married, but if I had I would have flown them all the way to Michigan just so they could shoot my wedding day. I hired them to do my Trash the Dress photo shoot and they were amazing, but wait it gets better they were CHEAP!  They came all the way to Phoenix from Flagstaff with two photographers and an assistant on a Sunday, and the whole thing only cost me $400!  That included the 4 hours of photos and the hi-res disk with release rights.  They had the most amazing ideas and they were super friendly and fun. Just thinking about it makes me want to get married all over again just so I can hire them to be my wedding photographer.  I would recommend them for ANY occasion and from what I understand they will travel almost anywhere.  Look on their site they have some great galleries.  Date of service: April 2010

Everyone remembers the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld well there's a woman who works at this location who reminds me on him, she basically sucks.  I used to go to AZ Sandwich Company twice a week to get a custom salad. It was always difficult to get them to put what i wanted on it but now it's impossible. They have apparently decided to feature only 6 salads -NO SUBSTITUTIONS (so intense).  I asked if I could pay extra but no go.  She said that her kitchen couldn't handle it, that it was too complicated to customize a salad...no offense but has the intelligence level of people sunk so low that a person who works at a sandwich/salad shop can't manage to add turkey to a classic salad?  Since this is what you do for a living you'd think you'd try a bit harder.  Ah well I guess I'll just go to Sack Sandwichs down the road, they're more then happy to customize and you get a free cookie with every order.

I purchased the deal chicken coupon which included the deep cond, scalp massage, blow out and make up.  I'm not totally sure that they did a "deep cond treatment" but the rest was right on. Katie did my blow out and she did a fantastic job. I was heading out to Vegas that evening so she threw in a little curl for free and I really, really liked my hair.  Courtney did my make up.  She has a great personality and she made the whole experience super fun. The ambiance was perfect, I love the way this place is decorated. They offered me mimosas and pastries and everyone was super nice.   In general I find reviews on Yelp dead on but in this case I was pleasantly surprised. I would go back again for sure. This would be a great place to bring a group of ladies for a fun day before you went out.

Love, Love, Love this studio. I love the people I love the ambiance, class variety and finally the price!  Each studio has windows from floor to ceiling and outside you look at a cute pond with a waterfall.  It's the perfect setting.  I would recommend this studio for all levels.

I've been going to Kosama for a little over a month now. I've finally done all the classes a couple of times so I'm ready to review :)    PROS:    Overall I really like the program. It's certainly effective and most of the time it's fun.   I really like the instructors and they do a great job of motivating the members.   There is a wide range of fitness levels that attend Kosama so no need to be afraid if you're a bit out of shape, they have alternate move for every exercise.    The class times are frequent so I don't have any problems fitting Kosama into my busy schedule.   The pricing right now is very reasonable. They just switched from some outrageous 8 week pricing that would have me running for the hills, and just in time for me to join  :-D.  Now you can pay monthly which works better for me.  CLASSES:  Plyos - I like this class and it's a great workout.  I'm not a huge fan of Plyometrics but there's enough variety that I still have fun in this class.  Kettlebells- This is my favorite of all the classes. I think Kettlebells are some of the best free weights and this class kicks my ass.  Cardioflex - BOOOOO I HATE this class. It features my least favorite moves and to top it off it's super repetitive. Boo, Boo, Boo I plan to avoid this class going forward.  Kickboxing - I used to work out at a boxing gym and I really loved It.  This class allows me to use some of the moves I learned previously.  I recommend purchasing the gloves they sell.   CONS:  The music leave something to be desired on most days, I wish they wouldn't play old school music put to beats. Since music is really important to keeping me motivated in my workouts this was almost a deal breaker for me but since I like the rest of the program I've decided to let it go.  I'm a little concerned about the new program that's currently featured on the website. One of the things I liked about Kosama was that they alternated the days they featured a particular class each week.  It appears that going forward all the classes will now take place on their respective day and the schedule won't be changing at all.  It's nice to have some variety, even if it's just that you do Kickboxing on a varied day. Hopefully they change this up again.   Overall I highly recommend this program. If you actually go several times a week you should experience the same results you would with a personal trainer only at half the price. All the members are really nice and the it's a really inviting environment, don't be intimidated to try it

Update since my last review. They've fixed the music issue so it's all good. However I accidentally stumbled into the Cardioflow class again yesterday and and am reminded how much I HATE that class. If they could switch it out for something else that would be worth 5 stars for me :)

The worst airline of all time. We booked them for our Vegas trip and it was nothing but problems going both ways.  They delayed us 2 hours going to Vegas due to mechanical issues.  The flight attendant told me that they almost cancelled the flight completely.  On the way home we were delayed 2.5 hours as soon as we checked in. They said that the plane that was flying in for us to board had an unruly passenger and as a result they had to turn around and drop him off, then come back.  (Now that I think about it I'm sure he was just pissed b/c he was delayed by 4 plus hours like everyone else that flys this POS airline).  Once the plane finally arrived they did a maintenance check and it was unfit to fly (SHOCKING!!!!). We were delayed further.  The planes are old and rickety and they nickle and dime you from baggage fees to seats. Trust me IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE. Just pay the extra $100 and get where you want to go safely and when you want to get there.

I was so excited to order this pizza after reading the reviews but I'm hugely disappointed!  The crust was dry and chewy and it tasted like their ovens needed to be cleaned. The wings were just so so I've tasted waaaay better and the chicken was very fatty. On a positive note the prices can't be beat but I'd rather pay a bit more for a better taste.  I really wanted to love this pizza it just isn't that good

We went on a hangover Sunday and when we walked in the place was packed and super loud so we decide to eat on the patio- if that option wasn't avail we would have left it was that loud. I ordered the egg sandwich with tots and a side of the Brioche French toast both were amazing. My husband ordered the pollo loco omelette and that was also very good. Our waitress was super nice and even though the place was slammed we felt well taken care of. The menu has tons of choices and the price was right.  There was a woman eating alone crying so we decided to pick up her meal and the manager came over and gave us a 20% off coupon which I thought was super nice!  We will for sure return

I placed an online order to be delivered to our office for a lunch meeting. First they arrived over an hour late. When we called to follow up on the food the person answering the phones was not apologetic and bordering on rude.  When the food finally arrived the order was wrong. They brought a chef salad instead of garden and the person who ordered it is a vegetation so she had to go without lunch. They also brought an extra meatball sub, not sure who that was supposed to be for but I guess that means they had at least two angry customers that day. I honestly feel filling food orders is the easiest job in the world, just double check the bag before it leaves, there's no excuse for this type of mistake. I won't be ordering from them again.

I love, love, love this groomer. I have a hard to handle Olde English Bulldogge and they are the only ones that can handle cutting his nails.  The owners are sweet and knowledgeable. I also have a Dog de Bordeaux rescue and they understand that she needs a calm hand.  I like to use the self serve baths but they offer full service as well.  Their product line is high end and all natural.   Outside of the amazing services they owners are amazing. Their active in the rescue community. They adopt senior dogs that are often sick and as such nobody else wants. They have huge hearts and if anybody deserves your business it's them.

So happy that this place opened. I'm almost embarrassed to admit how much I've missed hanis since I moved here from MI 5 years ago.  My husband and I got the hanis, chili dog and chili cheese fries with Rock & Rye obviously!  Everything was just how we remembered it to be.  Oh and BTW  to all the cheapy reviewers I could not care less if they charge $2.50 for a Faygo.  If you can't afford $2.50 then you shouldn't be going out to eat in the first place, this isn't a soup kitchen it's a restaurant if you don't want to pay the price drink water, kay?  The owner and his staff are super nice and all from MI - I would expect nothing less.  If you are from MI and miss the Coney Island staples check this place out you won't be disappointed...if you're not then try it for the first time, it's worth it.

I'm so glad that I found April! She never disappoints. I always know that even if I give her a vague idea of what I want done she'll nail it. My hair has never been healthier or looked better than it has since I've been going to her. I wouldn't  trust anybody with my color, cut or extensions.  April also does my waxing and she's amazing at that as well!  She uses great products and her salon is comfortable and classy. Go see her, trust me you won't be sorry

I was sent home from work sick so I decided to call him last minute. He was nice enough to fit me in and I'm so glad he did. It embarrassing how filthy my car was. It's been a while since I've had time to have it cleaned. It's aboslutely perfect now. It's as clean as when I picked it up from the dealership, possibly more so!  He's worth every single penny.

I absolutely love, love, love the food at Hula. The lobster bisque soup, the Hula Burger, the Bowls they're all amazing!  The service was super slow but the server was very nice.  The only thing I would count as a downfall is they're patio is way too small and the inside doesn't have a comfortable atmosphere so the dining experience isn't that great.  Since the food is so amazing I'll probably just do carry out.

Your Review I really enjoyed my PWAT experience last Friday. The lead artist was easy to follow and extremely helpful. They made the whole experience relaxing and fun and the class ran at a good speed. One of the my favorite parts was the music they played and the contests they did as breaks during the evening.

I could not have been happier with Cloud9's services. They were polite when scheduling and through in their work. I had them clean both exterior windows and screens. I received several quotes and they were the most reasonably priced. I would recommend them to anybody

Frank and his crew did an amazing job moving our 3 bedroom house this weekend. They showed up 15 minutes early and completed the move an hour faster then I expected. Their base rate was more reasonable then most but the service was outstanding.  We put our belongings in a storage pod (Units and Storage who are also amazing). They managed to get all of our items totally protected in a very small space. They took apart all of the furniture that wouldn't fit and packed it safely. The crew was super nice and polite.  I've had some awful experiences with movers in the past and starting now I won't use anybody but Thompson moving. He doesn't have a lot out there in the digital space but check out his flawless BBB rating if you need a second opinion.  http://www.bbb.org/central-northern-western-arizona/business-reviews/movers/thompson-moving-llc-in-glendale-az-97008296/

I have been seeing Dr Kidd for years and I could not be happier with her. She's caring but also very straight forward, no bullshit. I recommend her to anybody.
