Best carwash for the best price in town. All of the employees do a great job ensuring all parts of your car are clean. For 11.99 you can get the basic carwash which is better than any drive through you will find and only a couple bucks more. Highly recommend this place.

I started at a Verizon store in Surprise where I waited 20 minutes after being told there was a 10 minute wait. I still had one person ahead of me and an appointment to get to. After the appointment I headed to this location. While attempting to purchase a phone outright full price as a gift, I was told they could not sell a phone without activating it and no exceptions. Apparently I will have to find another gift or just not give my money to Verizon. I love the service apparently customer service is not up to par with their the service they provide. Not sure if I am paying retail price why I would be fixed to activate a phone. I suppose I can buy on the secondary market which provides Verizon 0 profit. Jowly sure why or how this benefits their business.

Prices are good and came for a band which was great. The service however is inconsistent and who and how many drinks they will serve varies based on the bartender. If you have policies no problem but they need to be enforced consistently or not be in place. I will continue to come for shows but would recommend only coming if you understand the poor service you will receive.

If I could write a negative star review I would. An individual for this company came out to get keys from the trunk of a car. I was out of town and the person who locked them in called. The tech attempted to enter the vehicle through the trunk which created a slight bend which was no big deal I was able to bend it back into place. The problem was they also attempted to use the manual release which was know to be broken. They disassembled the switch opens the trunk and reassembled the switch which now works to open the trunk. The problem,is the trunk and gas release are connected so I can no longer release the gas cover to fill the car and there is no manual release in the trunk.   I called to report the issue and spoke to the most rude individual I have ever spoken with. I told him what had happened and he told me I wasn't even making sense. He asked how the manual trunk release had anything to do with the ability to get gas in the car. I tried to explain to him that the switches are connected push down to release the gas lid and pull up to release the trunk.    For approximately 10 minutes he berated me and placed the blame on me. He told me it was a Sunday evening and asked what I expected he asked if I expected "special ops and black forces" called out to fix the problem (keep in mind they are listed as a 24/7 service). I explained that it is a major problem that I can not get gas in the car and would like to find a time to get it fixed. He continued to berate me and told me I was "talking out my ass" when that occurred I asked if he was the owner and he said no he was the dispatcher. I asked for an owner or managers name at which point he asked if "I wanted to talk to the governor?"   I continued to press for owner or manager information at which point he hung up on me.   They may have done some great work for others but if you have a problem I hope you receive help as opposed to being blamed, berated, cussed at and hung up on.     Good luck if you choose this company.
