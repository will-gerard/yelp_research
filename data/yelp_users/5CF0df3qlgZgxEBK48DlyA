Ignore the 'wait to be seated' sign and grab a table or head to the outside patio. Love love this place. If you come in fairly often (1-2 times a month like me) they remember your meal and drink preferences.   Service is always spot on and I've never had a bad meal here. Wish they'd bring back the salmon Reuben though. That was my addiction!!

Love this place!  Family owned hole in the wall. My son and I go here fairly often for soup and spring rolls. If my son decides to order something different we're always sent home with hot & sour soup. Great staff and quality food :)

Today I took my newly adopted yellow lab in for a standard wash, condition package. Cost was less than $30. I've never taken a pet in for grooming services but Lawrence wouldn't let me wash him myself. He was a stray picked up by the county before I adopted him so I know nothing of his history. He came out happy and looking very good. They definitely met my expectations and I will use them again

First time visit today to get my Lawrence a self wash. Super easy set up and very helpful friendly staff. I'll definitely be back.  This is my new 'go to' place for my pups needs :)

This business is closed but contrary to what another reviewer posted the other businesses in the complex are open and doing well. I've been here a couple times and wasn't impressed. Staff were nice enough but the place was too loud and the food. Meh.  Go anywhere else and I'd of been happier

My favorite hike in the valley is here. It's a good 45 minute drive from downtown and well worth it!  $6 entrance per vehicle cash only and they're always looking for 1s. Bring plenty of water and needle nose pliers for the cactus you'll catch!  We catch some every time

Today I had an appt for a general check up for my newly adopted pet. I've been petless for 8 years and was super happy to be able to find the vet who I used back then. I have to say. I've never had a better experience with a vet office. Everyone clearly loves animals and their jobs. I give them the highest recommendation.

The enchiladas are great!  Read a few reviews and decided to try them today. They make the enchiladas right in front of you in a pizza type oven. Soo good!  Also had a sangria which was also very good. We ordered the soup just to see and weren't impressed - the veg in it felt like it had been in a crockpot for days. Everything else was amazing tho and will definitely be back

Not a fan. The atmosphere is high tops and large bar in what looks like a mission but also lots of tvs for the sports fans.  We tried a bunch of the tacos. The only meat that had flavor was the coffee beef. The others were sweet..  Just weird

One of my favorite places for breakfast. Their corned beef hash is the best!  Not a huge fan of the omelette but that's ok. The hash is always my go to :)
