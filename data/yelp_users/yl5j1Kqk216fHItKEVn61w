My boyfriend and I LOVE their pizza! It is our go to for date night. After years of gross and cheap pizza at student organization meetings, I have mostly given up on voluntarily choosing pizza for my meals, but this place is the exception!

My family and I have been coming to TC Egginton's since I was a child, and we still make a point to come by for breakfast every weekend! The food, service, and atmosphere are all phenomenal. Everything on the menu is good, but my personal tip is to order the cordon bleu omelette. It is not on the menu anymore, but they are happy to make it for you and it is delicious!

Came in here for dinner while staying in North Phoenix. Seated immediately (even though it looked busy!), waiter was friendly and made great beer, wine, and food suggestions. We ended up splitting a platter with St. Louis ribs, beef brisket, and smoked sausage with Mac and cheese and a dressed baked potato on the side. Scrumptious! Finished with a surprise bag of fresh homemade cinnamon donuts. If it wasn't so far from my home in the east valley I would definitely return!

I had been meaning to try this for a long time and finally made it in! I am not at all familiar with Indian/Pakistani food so I can't remember what I had, but it was delicious! A friend got the masala fries which were to die for.

The service has been incredibly slow every time I've been, but since I only go on Tuesday nights for their happy hour martinis (get the Effin' Good!) and $5 burgers, it's understandable. Great deal and cool atmosphere!

Recently had a wonderful dinner here! We started off with an order of bruschetta, which was incredibly fresh. Then we each had a personal pizza, the Regina Margherita and the Pomo. All of the ingredients were perfection and the dough was nice and thin. While we were waiting on our tiramasu (which was incredible) the head chef Matteo brought us a cinnamon liqueur that tasted like Cinnabon in a shot! The service was great, the patio was pleasant, and the food could not have been better.

My first time here was a bad experience in service, but since I'd been to the one in Gilbert, it was a game day, and Annex had only been open for a few weeks at the time, I knew I would give them another shot. I am glad I did because I have had great service ever since! This place has been an amazing respite from the rigors of law school for my classmates and I. I love the ambiance and the Monday/Tuesday $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine deal cannot be beat.

Tried this place for lunch because Sal's has been open only for dinner/late night recently. Terrible, terrible pizza. It was greasy ( as in soak through the paper plates greasy) and bland. Too much cheese and too little sauce. Overpriced for how disappointing it was. Would not recommend or try again.

Came here with my parents and was not impressed. I thought the atmosphere was cool when we first walked in. We waited for a while before anyone greeted and seated us, despite the fact it was 4pm on a weekday and it was far from busy.   The host who seated us handed my mother a drink menu and nearly handed me one, seemingly thought better of it, and gave it to my father, instead. My mid-twenties age may warrant asking for my ID, but it certainly doesn't call for taking my drink menu away! I did order the house-made red sangria and it was quite good.  My parents had raved about the garlic knots, so we ordered some as an appetizer. Unfortunately, these were overcooked.  The pizza was just alright. We shared a (boring) sausage Sicilian pizza at my parent's request. I prefer more interesting toppings so I may try a pizza off their menu sometime.
