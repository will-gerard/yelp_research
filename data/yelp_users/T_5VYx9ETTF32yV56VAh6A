To start, you know if you're going to Dominos that you're not expecting amazing pizza. You're just expecting to get pizza that reminds you of being a kid.....nostalgically delivered to your doorstep. The pizza is edible and it's quite like riding a moped (fun unless you get caught by your foodie-friends). I must say though, even with such low expectations of the food....the customer service at this location is downright TRAGIC!  I was actually told when I telephoned about my pizza being exceptionally late "we don't want you as a customer anyways". I wouldn't put my hard earned cash here....Who wants mediocre food AND crappy customer service?

Yum!  I love  coming here.  The boba is great and the vibe is awesome!  Its a cool little spot with graffiti and art  on the walls.  I believe all the decor is done by people who visit it.  I can spend a good hour reading and looking at it all.  I totally recommend it as a spot to hang with friends.

We spent over $400 dollars to have an amazing birthday party for my 5 year old at the Children's Museum. During this time we purchased a family membership for the year so me and my ex could both take our daughter. When we purchased a family pass they never mentioned that my ex and I had to be in the same household to use the pass and we have successfully enjoyed the museum many times on our pass before today. When my daughter and I tried to use the pass today a very rude woman working the front counter told us that we had to be in the same household to use the pass and I could be put on as a "nanny" if my ex showed up to approve it. Excuse me? I am the MOTHER not a nanny and I was greatly offended. I can't even believe she said that! I can't believe they would rather me lie and say I was my daughter's nanny then tell the truth that I am her mother, but she has two homes one with her dad and one with me.  We have been coming to the museum for years and it just left a bad taste in my mouth the entire visit. There are so many families that are split up and I should not have to have my daughter embarrassed at the front counter of a museum because her family is different than a traditional family. I am so disappointed and I really hope when I call a manager on Tuesday that there is an apology or we will never spend another dime at this discriminatory establishment!

This is by far the best ice cream I've had to date. It is thick and creamy and all their flavors pack a punch. The decor is also really cute. I love that they offer strange flavors for the food-courageous (Think potato chip and watermelon cilantro).   I also like how helpful and cheery the staff is. I've special ordered several custom ice cream birthday cakes for my daughter and they were always beautifully crafted. Great and cute local business!

I would highly recommend visiting this practice. When it comes to practices in the medical field it's more than just the doctor that makes up the practice. This practice not only has a great and competent doctor, but an amazing staff! They never seem bothered by my questions ( I worry about everything) and always seem to be happy to help. I've never had an issue with insurance or billing, which a lot of other doctors have tried to screw me. They really seem to know what they're doing and have no problem treating you kind while they're doing it.   As for my experience as a patient at Desert Ridge Oral and Implant Surgery, I came to the practice after a good friend recommended it. I had such a bad experience with my first 2 wisdom teeth that I was terrified to get my other 2 extracted. I started getting pain and my teeth were shifting so I knew that it was time to face the fact that it needed to be done. The moment I made the first phone call I knew I was in great hands. I anticipated a very agressive doctor from the previous review, but that was not the case at all. He actually had an excellent bedside manner. He told me how it was and was instead of arguing with him I let him be the professional and went with his advice. I'm glad I did because everything turned out as he described and I am no longer in pain. Sometimes you just need to trust the process.   The follow up treatment was better than what I exected. When you get a checkup phone call to see how you're doing that just demonstrates a tremendous amount of care and concern. When my kids get their wisdom teeth in I would trust Dr. DeFelice to take care of them.

I have to finally write a review about this place. I'm not going to bore you with the clich√© "I never write reviews but this place was so good I had to" kind of review. No, this place is deserving of so much more. Truth is, I have written quite a few reviews about places. This one is going to join them. What makes this place stand out among the others is that I am writing this review from another restaurant because I am thinking about Porkopolis.    Yes. I am out to eat somewhere else and I'm thinking about how sucky it is that I cannot eat the sweet, delicious, juicy bbq that hails from Porkopolis. The only therapy for me right now is venting about how darn amazing the food and atmosphere is there. I know of no other words than juicy and freaking delicious when describing the taste of the food. Also, I've always been angry at the fact that most bbq restaurants let you spit on the floor and......that's just gross. This place isn't a farm. It isn't a county fair. It's this little piece of proper Heaven where you can eat messy barbecue but have aesthetic pleasure at the same time. Sign me up a million times over.   In addition to the atmosphere and food, I - the girl who is not at all social - am on a first name basis with the server. His name is Jordan. You should also be on a first name basis with him because he takes care of business and won't judge you if you have a little bbq-face (trust that this has happened).   Long story short for those who have made it this far......Every time I choose a place other than Porkopolis I feel like I have failed. I've failed myself and I've certainly failed my stomach. Go check it out. See your new favorite server Jordan. Your taste buds deserve a party.

As I write this I am six months pregnant.....so let's just say the idea of bending over a bathtub to wash my dog and then spending another good 30 minutes cleaning up all the fur leftover from it seemed like a back wrenching nightmare. But, I really didn't want to spend over $40 dollars to have my dog groomed by the groomer.   Solution? A self-wash dog wash!   As soon as I came in with my dog I was greeted by a warm environment and friendly faces. They helped me get the supplies I needed and picked the right sized tub (read: no bending down AT ALL). They made me and my Boston Terrier feel comfortable before leaving it to us to get the washing done. They periodically checked in with us to make sure we had everything covered. It was perfect.   I couldn't ask for a better experience for the price. It was a nice environment, affordable, and the customer service was on point. Plus, I supported a growing business today.  Side note: they also sell natural dog foods, treats, and dog-wear. I ended up walking away with a cute soy collar for under $6.   We will definitely be returning and I suggest if you have a dog to check this place out.

Let me start off by saying that making me laugh requires an abnormally high amount of effort. I wish laughter came easily for me because I WANT to laugh when I'm not busy watching Star Trek or programming this generation's next ridiculous app. Alas, this review is not about me. This review is about the surprisingly amazing place that is JesterZ.   JesterZ, you caught me off guard. I came in with my cold and lifeless sense of humor and walked out with the feeling that I put in time at the gym. My. Abdominal. Muscles. Hurt. So. Good.   I want to believe that I was right in being a skeptic of this place l, but I was very wrong. Most notable thing about this place was that the cast had amazing chemistry with each other. Each person performing had a different style of performing, which was surely to appeal to the different sense of humour in the crowd. The way they played off of each other's styles made the act of performing improv look simply effortless.   As the engaging host took the audience through many different improv games, we were all left with memorable moments of hilarity and opportune participation. This isn't a show where you just sit and listen, you are able to contribute to the scene, which makes it even more impressive. 90 minutes of performing and they never lost their energy or appeal. I only wish that during those 90 minutes I was able to get an intermission so I could get MYSELF together!  As for the facility, the decor is nice, clean and fits the theme well. They have drinks and snacks and a great little area where you can take photos with your family or friends.   I have written reviews on Yelp sparingly, most normally when I experience something so utterly life changing that I feel the need to share my experience. Please, if you're on the fence about seeing a show here just TRY IT! I found the show to be intelligent, honest, hilarious and very gratifying. Congratulations JesterZ, you have a forever fan.

I came to see Paige as a total skeptic. I never knew about SRT or how it worked, but I was willing to check it out with an open mind because that's just how I approach life. During our first visit, Paige uncovered some information that was unique to me and not something she would have known or guessed. Talk about CHILLS! But SRT is more than a palm reader could ever provide and it's quite different actually. I couldn't even begin to articulate it because it's really one of those things you have to experience and it's different for everybody. I can say that since my first session I have had 10 or so more and have gone to see Paige for everything from my sick children, my husband's backache, financial stress, trouble focusing, etc. Paige is extremely good at setting you up to be independent and master issues that are preventing you from progress. She has given me tools to dig myself out of situations that were causing me tons of grief. SRT works if you are open to it and willing to put in the effort after your session and I could not imagine a better consultant than Paige.
