Simply the worst dining experience I've had. From the moment I walked in the experience was just AWFUL. The hostess was rude and not welcoming whatsoever, an older lady that was waiting to be seated even made a remark to her about her rudeness, so I know it wasn't just me that noticed it. We asked to be seated in their "lounge" area as we were planning to have a couple of drinks. Once sat, one waitress came by to take our drink order(mind you we hadn't received drink menus) so we began asking about their drinks and pricing. Her response was that she didn't know, so I asked for a drink menu, she came by, dropped it off and disappeared. About 10 minutes later another waitress came by to take our drink order I inquired about a beer, which was not on the drink menu provided to us, and again the response was that she didn't know. She finally came back after she checked and we placed our drink order. We waited over 20 minutes for two simple drinks, a michelada and a Budweiser in the bottle. Unless they're brewing the beer in the back, I really don't think it should take that long for two beer drinks. But since we were sitting in the bar area, we could see what was taking so long. Clearly this place is a place of "usuals", because two ladies were getting in an altercation and other patrons from all over the bar area knew them by name and the staff caters directly to their usuals. One usual walked in and not even 2 minutes later, her margarita was ready for her at the bar... But I waited over 20 minutes for a simple beer and some tomato juice, that was not tasty at all. When we finally asked if we could order food, the waitress off the bat handed us "to-go" Boxes which was really confusing since we hadn't even placed our order. Sounds welcoming, right? When we finally got our food, it was sub-par, the usual Americanized Mexican food, nothing spectacular as people had raved to me about. About 15 minutes into our meal, the check was dropped off. We weren't asked if we wanted another drink, nothing. We felt we were being rushed out of the establishment. My friend who I was with was not happy and asked when she came by if we couldn't stay to have another drink(hypothetically, because we didn't really want to stay somewhere where we felt unwanted) because it felt like she wanted us out. Her response was that we could stay as long as we needed she had just dropped off the check for when we were ready... But we looked around, and noticed that no other tables around us had checks dropped off, some who had been there longer than us, again the "usuals".  I've seen another review regarding they felt their service was poor due to their race, and my friend who I was with felt exactly the same way. I don't like to make everything about race, but sometimes, it's hard not to.   All-in-all, it was a disappointing experience. I moved here over 10 years ago and always heard about this place, and when I finally had the chance to go, I was excited, but wasn't expecting this experience. I am a self-proclaimed foodie and a localist and this is a local establishment I will not  support again.

We had an excellent experience at Liberty Market today. I was a bit disappointed the chicken Apple sausage was no longer on the menu, but John was an amazing host and quickly helped me find something else on the menu. John is a great asset to the restaurant and really made our experience a five star experience. His warm and welcoming personality makes Liberty a place I'll definitely keep on my list of favorites.

Seriously? The line to the customer service desk is out the door and they only have two girls manning it. This is ridiculous! There are five other associate in the vicinity; one standing at the counter playing on computer, three others playing on a phone and one other just watching the line get bigger. C'mon now!

The two stars is for the $2 brunch mimosas, but the food was subpar, and that's putting it nicely. The server was friendly, but the service was slow. There was only one other table taken in the entire dining area but still we waited incredibly too long for our order to be taken and our food to be brought out. Once we did get our food, we were truly disappointed. Two of us in our group ordered benedicts and none were cooked correctly. The "poached" eggs were all over-cooked. I had the florentine Benedict and there was nothing about it that would make me return. The sauce was mediocre, the spinach and artichokes were minimal and the potatoes were extra crunchy. One person in our group ordered the salmon sandwich and the comment was that it tasted good at first but only because there was sauce. Once the sauce ran it, the taste was bland. We had to have a cheeseburger comped because it was too dry to eat. The kids chicken fingers were not great but edible. Even the desserts didn't impress me, and it doesn't take much to impress me in the dessert department. It's hard to see how this place stays open, but it makes sense why it was so empty when we arrived. The location is great and the place is beautiful, but the food just didn't cut it for me. I will not be returning.

Two weeks of personal training with Sonia, and I'm hooked. All this fitness is new to me, but she is helping get past my intimidation. Initially I didn't want a female trainer, but was convinced to give her a shot and so far she's not disappointed. If you've not had your fitness assessment with Anthony, DOOO IIIIT!!! He does a great job, and he practically lives at the gym, so he knows his stuff  If you've been unsuccessful with your goals due to lack of accountability, I highly recommend signing up for personal training.... There is a no slacking policy... Sonia(or any of the trainers) will kick your a$$ and then Anthony will watch, from near and far, to make sure you're keeping up with the required cardio. Again, a little intimidating, but I guarantee you won't want to quit.   I only didn't give this gym 5stars due to their choice of channels on the tv. It's NBA playoffs, they should have EVERY game on!!

I love Bar Louie, one of my favorite happy hour places in the area, however I was extremely disappointed after my visit last night. I ordered my usual; a clover and the hummus, tapenade and tzatziki plate. We got our drinks first of course, but when my plate came out I was completely disgusted to see that the cucumber they had served me was spoiled. It was dark in the restaurant but not dark enough to not be able to see that it was spoiled. When I pointed it out to the waitress she took the bad cucumber and brought back a new, crispy one. However, considering the dangers of E. coli in spoiled cucumbers I was shocked that she didn't even comp my meal. I hate to say it, but I will probably stay away from Bar Louie for a while.
