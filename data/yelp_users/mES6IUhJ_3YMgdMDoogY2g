The staff, nurses and people in maternity were all awesome, they took such good care of us, my wife and newborn baby. Can't say enough about how great they all are.  The construction was a little annoying and the kitchen messed up my wife's food order almost every time, but it's not a restaurant. Important part was mama and baby are healthy and happy.

This review is only for holding an event here, not an individual dining experience.  Prefixe menu had good choices and food was good, not amazing but really good for a big group of about 25-30. The group was very high maintenance and the staff and servers did a stellar job serving and taking care of special needs. Service was too long, but not sure if that was intentional and they did nail the meals so I won't deduct points. They did a overall great job managing the event, would go back.

For such a big city you expect more.  Price is right though.  And they do have some nice pieces and get in some good exhibitions but didn't seem like they have much of a collection on their own.  We liked the American impressionists that held their own next to Monet Arches and Pissaro.  Very helpful descriptions but I did find the layouts in some of the galleries confusing and didn't flow well.  The Warhol was there at the time and was extensive, interesting place in history (was he the first selfie!) but not  a huge fan.

4* for a coffee shop.  If it were my local I would not be disappointed.  Great service and staff, cool vibe and I like how there is lots of seating.  And the coffee was great, I like that they roast their own. They even took the time and care to make me the craft espresso which they weren't serving that day.  Well done!

Fun place. The avocado pizza missed a little for me, difficult to eat but had great flavors. Wings are juicy and nice bbq flavor. Good espresso.   Fun, casual, dining experience. I like these grocery store style spots. Grab what you want to drink, beer, wine, soda, take up to the counter, place your order, pay and then open seating.

They did not respect my time. At the very least they were very careless in managing their workflow and giving me accurate time frame for work to be done. I had to leave after sitting for 45 minutes when I originally asked if I should book an appointment and come back. Because they didn't bother to check their appointments for the day they bumped me back three spots and said it would be another hour and I didn't trust that. And then after I waited 45 minutes they asked me if I wanted to make an appointment and come back. They should have checked their appointments first before telling me a time or just let me book an appointment to begin with. And I had to ask, they didn't even bother to let me know hey we had to bump you, this is the new time. Apparently they were content to let me sit there all day.   My family were long time customers but I will never go back. Hello Costco or firestone.

This place does it for me, a meat lovers paradise! Great service and a fun dining experience. Like the lower sirloin and the house special.   Perfect for meat lovers that want to eat all you want and have a unique dining experience.

I went in for breakfast with the bar set high after reading the reviews here and they delivered.   Huevos Rancheros was amazing. Almost life changing. Almost. The coffee was good too. Service was equally excellent. Thank you yelpers for the solid recommendation!

It's not that service is bad, servers are great, but maybe understaffed and managers are either inept or just don't care. Managers zero stars and servers 5 stars. And I guess the owners must be somewhere in between.   Been here three times and they get orders wrong every time. And it is slow. Too bad because the wings  when done properly, are on par with best I've had in town.   They need some new management to get things straightened out. I get feeling current managers don't care. But servers do. And the place had potential.

Great spot.  This is what I like, the focus is on the food, service and good execution all at a good price point in a lively but casual setting.  All the fine dining with none of the snootiness.  Well done.  Last time in I had a pork and chili stew that the whole table cheered and won the night.

Wow.  So. Good.  I could just leave it at that.    First, don't let the non-descript strip mall look from the outside turn you away.  The actual space inside and is a pretty cool ambiance for unwinding and enjoying good food after a busy week.  When we were there for dinner it was mostly professionals all enjoying a nice, relaxing quiet dinner.    Started out with some hamachi that had a grapefruit component that completely washed out any flavor from the fish.  Point of sushi is to enjoy the flavor of the fish. Huge miss.  I asked the server about it, if I were missing the concept or something and she agreed.  And without me asking or anything further she brought out another sushi dish that was delicious.  Huge save.  I think it's very classy to when restaurants do this without you having to ask and be "that guy".  Makes the experience much better and is a huge win in my book. And big points for the server!  Next up were cheese courses.  House made mozz with bacon which was good.  But the ricotta with honey and a walnut sauce that was just fabulous.  Savored every bite.    We were already on a roll when the entrees hit the table.  I ordered a brisket with a tower of bone marrow and the flavor combos were just sensational.  (Yes, I said a TOWER of bone marrow.  Well played sir, well played.)  I liked the brisket was not sauced allowing to enjoy the flavor of the brisket and in a different way then usual.  And the bone marrow was a wonderful accompaniment.  Overall the service, food, and ambiance was very satisfying and I can't wait to get back.

I thought this might be between a four or three but felt  it earned a four. Service was just a little spotty but you can tell they care and want to run a top notch eatery and that comes through.   Our day started here for lunch before a visit to the museum. We shared the meatballs for an app and the fried polenta was near life changing. I would go back just for that.   For entrees we had salads, me the chicken panzanella and wife had the chopped. Both solid. I appreciate when a place like this, known for pizza in this case, also has good salad and healthier options.   I would go back next time I'm in central, but I would eat at their sister lgo in the neighborhood.

Great overall dining experience. This might be a hidden gem for the area as its off the beaten path on Osborn but worth going a little out of the way.  Inside was a cool ambiance of fine dining but not uppity.  Service was wonderful and our server was great, like that he was very passionate and a fellow foodie so we chatted about our favorite spots and chefs the whole night.   Some fun and unique items on the menu.  We got buffalo meatballs to start.  I had the duck which was wonderfully prepared, seasoned, and just perfectly cooked to medium. Was tender to eat and not overly gamey.  A real home run for a duck dish.  We had a side of asparagus tempura that rocked!  I will definitively be back.  I do hear mixed reviews about the other location i Scottsdale but never been so I don't know if this one is maybe different/better?

We thoroughly enjoyed our evening here.  First, the setting at the Biltmore was very cool and has the look and feel that reminded us of places like this in Manhattan.  You feel walking through the door that you might be in store for something special.  And for us it delivered with great service, and well executed dishes with unique twists to classic dishes.    The service was first class as well.  I like dhow we entered awkwardly through the back but the front of the house immediately identified us and came up to greet us.  Nice touch!    Their signature chop salad is worth going there for alone.  I would have liked a full explanation but their philosophy of the restaurant is tied into the salad.  Must get more on that next time.  But it was probably one of the best if not most interesting presentations for a salad.  And just very appealing to the eye.  It ate just as well!  I ordered the duck meatloaf.  Why?  Because when someone offers you duck meatloaf you should take it.  I did.  And it was spectacular.  Juicy and moist with a wonderful sauce. And not gamey tasting if you are wondering but the duck did come through.  I don't mined the gamier more ducky tasting dishes but this one was nice to get a more subtle duck flavor.   Wife had chicken with a pan sauce that was perfectly cooked, juicy and sauce went well.   Desert we had a samplig of chocolate cake and a banana bread pudding that hit big time.

What a cool place. Good service and good food. We had the quacamole for app, good but I felt the oranges in it was a mistake, took away from the avocado flavor. Wife had kale salad was good. I had the vegetarian tacos but then oddly enough the server upsold me on adding chicken but it didn't need it. They were very accommodating. Desert was excellent, had I've cream and they even combined scoops for me with two flavors.   I'm looking forward to going back for coffee and also just a drink. Seems like a cool atmosphere for just hanging out. Might be a 5*,will see next time.

We hit this up for restaurant week.  Service was really slow, maybe because of said restaurant week but the food was good and would go back for another visit. It is nice to see this style of southern food in the valley though.  We shared some starters, the fried green tomato and gumbo, both were solid. The tomato looked to be a real nice heirloom and was wonderfully crispy fried.   I had a veal meatloaf which was out of this world for how fluffy and moist it was but crusty on the outside. The gravy was a most excellent pairing.  I also tasted the fish and pork chop, both good, the pork chop was perfectly cooked tender and juicy.    Desert was red velvet cake and a dutch chocolate cake both of which were average and nothing to write home about. But they did have beignets which finished off the night on a high note.  Not sure it was the best beignet I ever had but hey, it was a beignet!!!  Definitely earned a trip back for us, just hope there isn't so much of a wait between the courses next time. That might be about the only thing keeping it from a 5* for me.
