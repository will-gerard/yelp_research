too bad, but you knew it would happen the douche bags would find this place out and now, the hoards and the masses of DB's are roaming about this groovy, mid-century modern that tosses a pretty good pie but sadly the ol' DB factor has ruined the place, for this guy it's no fault of the owners they did their very best but now the dicks and boners have descended from the East and the West side, in their True Religions to prey on the Cougars, et al who also have seeked out the parlor the kitty's have started to crawl around, looking for action made up, for making out and you know the rules of attraction will keep the C's and DB's, turning out. I'll miss you, Parlor Pizza enjoyed our little affair, but I'm off, seeking douche-free pastures man!! ....I used to love it there.....

hey hippies, i love it, when the two of you open pizzerias, in the avenues especially when, it's on ave, forty-three that's almost, one hundred, blocks away from me!!! so i won't be tempted, to one-day, drop back in i asked y'all once, and i'll ask you again please stop it, you hippies, your pizza is bad the burgers and fries, other things i've had are fine for five bucks, nope, can't fault you there but for breakfast or pizza, it's buyer beware take my advice, and cross this off your list of places for pizza, it's a miss not a hit sure they'll toss a pie, but don't toss 'em your dough there's so many other, good places to go then again, some might eat it, hippies, I suppose right after they fire, a big ganja bowl 'cuz then you'll eat anything, remember it well colombian gold, nag champa, the smell of weed, from my dorm room, you'd need it, to eat the food that they served us, that mystery meat but dudes, i digress, back to the two hippies out in the avenues,  the store's pretty nifty posters and nik naks, tacked to the walls cool clutter, kitschy, but hey, aren't they all? two things shared in common, these pizza joints, guys a funky décor, and a really bad pie  (two stars for pizza only. burgers are a-ok)

i'm a fan of, less is more but those i found, inside this store can't get enough, hoard trendy threads "eek! chic" for cheap,  we watched 'em spend i'd rather pick out, one thing nice than get three shirts, for the same price that will not last, and you won't wear beyond one season, and don't you dare tell me otherwise, it's true impulsive purchase? we eschewed the stuff was ugly, looked like ass everything we looked at, pass perhaps the store is not for us we came to buy, but had no luck anthropologie, br j crew, the hub, better by far for us, i guess, go check it out see what 'cheap chic' is all about get what you pay for, look & feel sometimes a deal, is not a deal so  H & M , dropping the "&" HMMMM.....guess I just don't, understand
