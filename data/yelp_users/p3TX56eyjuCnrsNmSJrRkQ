Great place for dinner! The wide variety of Martinis just sweetens the deal!

Been here several times, always have a great time. Great food, Great Service, and of course Great local beer selection.  While is does get noisy from time to time, I still find it a great place to take a date.  Introduced many people into the world of beer here, and plan to continue!

I mean I know it's 11am on a Saturday but would it kill anyone behind the bar to have a smile on their face?

That awkward moment when a club is suppose to show off what it has on opening night. I guess it was to bad I was a dude. Arrived late because honestly everything starts at 11pm anyways, to be told, as almost ever other guy in line, the would not be letting anymore males in. This happens at most places in Scottsdale but given the fact it was me and three women I thought I would be fine, but was very mistaken they were told they could go in, but without me, cause that made sense.  None the less, I guess I will not be spending my money here.

John was awesome, and Derek was a super sexy beer man. Me and the lil tina had a great time checking the new place out! And you know, Summer, running the place like a boss!
