Best customer service experience I've had. A plethora of paints and kind, knowledgeable employees. If one doesn't know the answer(s) to your question(s), they will find another who does. I highly recommend going here over any national chain paint or automotive store. This place is rockin'!

Their smoothie machine just wasn't having it today, so they immediately gave me my money back, a coupon for a free McCafe drink and a free large strawberry shake. They were so nice and accommodating. They're lucky it was me this happened to.

I give 2 out if 5 stars as opposed to 5 stars for the Flagstaff location and 4 stars for the tempe, mesa and Tucson locations. I brought my sandwich back to the counter because I was a huge idiot asshole who forgot to mention it to them before I got the sammich. I was direct and polite, but I got a snarky big dick with a beard and snake bites (which I have nothing against) in my face who made a comment along the lines of waiting on me hand and foot. Maybe I should have taken my tip back. As a former employee of ChÃ«ba Hut in Flagstaff, this style of "customer service" would get us fired in less than a heartbeat. Not sure what kind of vibe this place is trying to put out. In addition, my white widow was luke warm at best.

I attempted to purchase a $6.15 pack of cigarettes with 18 quarters and 17 dimes, but cashier Joe refused to sell me the cigarettes because he "didn't want to take a drawer full of change". 18 quarters and 17 dimes is not a "drawer full of change". I took my business to the chevron up Via Linda where they had no problem taking my legal tender. This cashier had been very nice to me for the past year-and-a-half, but for some reason decided to do this to me. Every place I've ever been a cashier, I had to take any form of legal tender, even if it was a mountain of pennies.

I am brand new to vaping. I decided to buy my first mod, tank and juice here on my birthday. I willingly spent twice my original budget. I signed up for the reward points program. 4 days later I come in to use a "free $15 bottle of eLiquid" coupon I received through the program only to be met with " We don't do that anymore. We're getting rid of the $15 bottles, sooooo........." That's not customer service. I spend $150+ here on my last visit and I get shut down with this open-ended b.s.?  No "Oh man, you know what? We're ending that program, but since you came down here I can take $(x) off your purchase today." No "We're so sorry to inconvenience or mislead you. Maybe I can interest you in a smaller bottle if you're tight on cash." Talk about leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Which reminds me; juices are unreasonably high priced here (giving me good reason to use the rewards program). I'll just take my business elsewhere.

Vapor Vortex professionally and cordially addressed and resolved the rewards points accrual system incongruity, apologized for the misunderstanding and has/is taking action to better their customer service and satisfaction. Thank you!  P.S. Prices have been SERIOUSLY reduced.
