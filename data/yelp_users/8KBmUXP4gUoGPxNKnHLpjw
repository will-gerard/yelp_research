First time dealing with Audi N. Scottsdale.  From the start we never felt any pressure. Paul Edgette was great to work with.  He allowed my wife and I to test drive 3 different Q7's and 1 Q5 which we ruled out bc of size.  He explained every detail of our lease along with audi customer perks. Since we were getting this car for my wife he also explained all the  tech and driving features of the Q7.  If your looking for a low pressure sales experience then I highly recommend Paul.

Impressed. Food and service were excellent  The decor is leather and wood with low lighting.  Dare I say Houston's  First visit I ordered the baby back ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and fries. The ribs were great, I was able to use my knife and fork to slide the meat off. The sides were great also. My wife ordered a potato soup and salad. Both excellent as well.  Second visit I ordered their famous French dip with au jus. Excellent, lean cuts of rare beef  also ordered a cup of clam chowder. It was loaded with clams and very tasty. The wife ordered the blackened mahi mahi. Cooked perfectly! Moist and delicious. We also ordered the "shrimp cargot". Charleston's take on escargot. Very tasty.  We'll definitely be back!

Great service. Great prices. Locally owned and made in America.  Small showroom but efficient.  We purchased a new bed for our daughter. She loves it :). Located in a small strip mall. Use your gps to find this place. They usually keep their stock on hand for immediate delivery.

Very small sushi portions! I ordered a yellow tail hand roll and it was literally half the size of most hand rolls! They should just call it a " mini" hand roll and not charge $8 for it! Their traditional rainbow roll and "voodoo" roll were also on the small side.  When are they gonna expand their Asian beer offerings??? Hello, Asahi, Hite, Orion are all better than Budweiser Brewerd Kirin.  I remember why I haven't eaten at a Kona grill in a long time.  Definitely won't be going back.  Server was nice.

I've been to both locations and the Food is great! Love their Philly cheesesteak, Filet Mignon/Gorgonzola, and Prickly Pear chicken sandwiches.  The Pizza is good too.  Best app is the goat cheese bruschetta w/ balsamic.

2 stars for good service although the hostess skipped us even though we did the "call ahead"  The food at outback is mediocre at best. I never order steak there bc it doesn't measure up to Flemings, Mastros etc. Mahi mahi is dry.  Cesar salad w chicken ( precooked slices) was bland.  Cheese fries w ranch are great when yr drunk.

This place looks like it changed ownership?  We've been here b4 n the service was fair to good. Its gotten considerably worse. It was 845pm and we were the only table being served. The latest yelp reviews complained about poor service n rude wait staff.  I'm in agreement after last night. Also adding the tip to yr bill for a party of 4 is just plain wrong.  We will not be going back. There are plenty of good Korean restaurants in the valley.

I'll give it 4 stars. It was our first time to Phoenix's "best pizza". The pizza is good. Especially the white pizzas.  Love the thin crispy crusts. We ordered 3 pizzas for 4 adults and 1 child. Had some leftovers.  The beer and wine list is extensive with plenty of good offerings.  The appetizers are good also. Cheese plate could hv been bigger but very tasty. The olive order was definitely very good and a good portion.  Unless you arrive early you'll have to wait depending on the size of your party. We waited 45min.  They really should build another oven in the bungalow next door versus sending people over there to wait.  They'd be just as busy but they'd get people in n out quickly. Thru hv the space to do it. But maybe they just want to stay a small operation.  My wife would go back but maybe not if the wait is over 30mins. I think you can get thin crispy artisan pizza from a lot of restaurants throughout the valley.  ie. parlor, Grimaldi's etc.

Great Mexican food.  Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes.  Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.

Filet mignon was excellent! Esp w the red wine demi sauce.  The filet was buttery soft n very tasty.  Ordered the mashed potato side which was also good.  Meatball and spicy chicken wing appetizers were very good.  Moscow mule is their signature drink that is served in copper cups and are very refreshing.  Good place for a casual meal.

Awesome service, good food, excellent drinks!   I've been coming here for 15 years!  They do not skimp on alcohol when they make yr drinks.  That is the owner's policy :)))   He has locations in downtown Phx (Hanny's), in NYC ( Bar 89) and in Milwaukee and I hear Berlin, Germany.   They have excellent martini's that are filled to the top of the glass.  The mojito's are the best next to being in Miami and ordering one.  The food is good and can be shared in most cases.   The ambience is always amazing and the art work changes.   It can be tricky to find so def use Yelp and map it.  When you walk in you'll be transported to a high end NYC, LA, Miami type of venue.

Great food and excellent service.   Love the location.  Be sure to mk a reservation , esp if you want to sit on the patio.  We were seated in the sunroom which was actually better bc we were protected from the hot sun and this was in October! I've eaten here several times and at the location in DC.   Very good choice for the $

Bland breakfast burrito. Needs some salt. Yes the hot sauce is spicy but taste shouldn't be just about "how hot" the salsa is. I'll try it another day and update my review.

I'll be honest here.   The sushi is really good! Even the non-sushi items are really good.  But the service is really bad!   I'm not saying the servers are rude just slow and very slow.   I've checked out Kampai for over a year , sometimes 2 times a week for lunch service.   The place is usually half full and it still takes the chefs forever to get our orders out!  The last time we went it took 55 mins!!! Hello! It's lunch time, people usually have an hour or less for lunch and need to get back to work!   We stated that we'd need separate checks and were told that was fine but that they would charge 15% tip to each bill.  That's fine but when half of us had to tk our lunch to go versus enjoying it during lunch hour!!!!  WTF!!!!!!    We rushed and paid our bills w/ our 15% tip.    Needless to say we are going to find another sushi restaurant that knows how to get the lunch crowd served and out on time!!!!   I only gv Kampai 2 stars bc the food is good.

Moving always sucks but hiring the right moving company makes it suck less :)   I hired Camelback moving based on excellent reviews on yelp and I wasn't disappointed.  The lead agent/scheduler (Anthony Estes) was helpful and informative. He gave me accurate info based on the description of my house and its contents.  He advised 2 trucks and 4 men along with a 7-9 hour move.  His crew arrived w/in the window they quoted.   Chance was the foreman, his fellow workers were Lance, Jaque, and Martin.  All 4 were polite, hard working, fast, and efficient.  They shrink wrapped all of my furniture. They took apart beds, even a pain in the @#$ bunk bed and a desk.  They moved my plasma tv's and lots and lots of bins and boxes.    Bottom line, these guys were great, the company is excellent and I highly recommend them if you want a hassle free move.  Their rates are competitive and fair.  You pay for what you get.   :)

Arrived on time. We were seated promptly. However it took almost 3 hrs for dinner to completed. I'll be honest, the hotel had  vp Biden staying and he was dining that night at J&G.  So a lot attn was paid to him and his staff. Our waiter was polite but was over worked.  Our salad order was mixed up but corrected. We ordered the Kobe tomahawk chop which came 40min after our salads and was lukewarm in temperature. I could hv sent it bk but we were hungry by that point. We overheard a table of 4 complaining about their late arriving dinner also so I wasn't being too picky.  The view of the valley is great but that was about it.  We won't be returning.

Horrible! We had an 830 reservation on a Saturday night. We arrived at 820 n were told it would be about 20min.  At 845 I asked the hostess how much longer it would be and was told another 15 min.  I asked her why and she replied that they only had 3 servers and no busboy.  My gf and I had been waiting patiently but how can u be so short staffed on a Saturday night during Arizona restaurant week???? The couple next to us had been waiting since 8 for their table and were finally seated at 850! We left and headed to Roaring Fork and a GREAT meal and friendly service!!!!

Quality and variety are still there. We came for dinner on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were seated in about 10mins, not bad. Food was great again, beer was ice cold ;) A great place to try if your new to Indian cuisine and if your a veteran than you'll enjoy your meal ;) Owners and staff are very nice and helpful if your confused on food choices.

Decided to have dinner here since it's so close to home plus a co-worker of my wife "highly recommended " it.  Service was spotty.  Took 5 mins or so before our drink orders were taken. We had to ask for water with our chips n salsa.  Blue margarita was good the michelada (sp) was ok.   Dinner arrived before our ceviche app. Wish we'd ordered the small one because the ceviche was bland and boring. Lacked salt. We left 3/4 of it uneaten.  Wife and daughter ordered bean n cheese burritos and they were good but it's hard to mess that up. I ordered the fish filet in culichi sauce. Very small filets in a watered down version of culichi sauce. I could even see tiny bubbles in the sauce that verified it had been "reduced". Bland but edible.  Flour tortillas were supposed to come with my order but they never materialized. At that point I didn't even ask for them.   If you want a really authentic Mexican seafood meal go to Mariscos Sinaloa in Mesa. Yelp it, it'll come up.

Had a great birthday meal. Our waitress nice and very helpful ;) The Shiromi carpaccio was easily the star of the show. Sliced thin n "cooked" in garlic sauce/broth table side. Served w focaccia bread to soak up the sauce ;) The foie gras was sweet n delicate. Rich but cooked very well.  The uni/oyster dish was tasty. A mixture of briny oyster and sweet smooth uni.  The blacked cod was excellent. The pork belly and sea bass were good.  The chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream was a great way to finish off the meal.

Went here for my birthday w my gf and daughter.  The hostess sat us at a corner table that was blocked in by another table!  That was fine until she sat another party at that particular table. Now I was blocked in and could easily eavesdrop not that I wanted too.   The restaurant wasn't busy and the waiter seemed to forget his introduction and our drink order. The bus boy was fast w the water and bread but that didn't help bc he's not the waiter. I saw the owner/manager and informed him of my concerns and he happily moved us to another table and sent over a waiter. The food was good but not spectacular.  I'll stick to Aaron May's "Iruna".

Found this company via yelp. Read the reviews and called Genady (owner). He came over and fixed our treadmill in an hour. Gave us some advice on maintaining the unit and fixed the problem. We had guests over and one of their kids had somehow shoved plastic into the wheel base which was affecting the motion sensor. Genady fixed the unit at the price ($95) he quoted (service call) but he was upfront that it may cost more if parts needed to be replaced (which they didn't). We'll definitely call him again if any of the other units need service.

I've had 2 great experiences with this company.  The first time they helped my wife fix our main garage door over the phone!!! Who does that??? They could easily have done a service call and charged $60 and up.  The second time was to fix my rv garage door. Rusty easily diagnosed the problem and ordered the correct springs. Once again no charge until he installed them today. And the parts and labor were very fairly priced. They were done in 30 minutes.  I figured since he was here might as well have him tune up the main garage door. He chkd it out and felt it was running well and didn't need the tune up at this time. Once again an honest business man! I highly recommend this company. Ask for Rusty.

Another good job well done. Main garage door operational bracket broke. Rusty came over at 7pm to check it out. Ordered the part and had it fixed the next day.  Once again if your looking for a fairly priced honest garage door service company look no further than triple B.

Third time I've used Triple B. Once again they came through   This time for my other RV garage door. Luckily it was an easy fix. Rusty just had to reconnect the door to the motor. He only charged me for gas !  Once again if you need an honest garage door company with fair pricing call Triple B.

Wow!!!  This place rocks!  It's Vietnamese Crack! I use that term with full praise :) I've eaten here 3 times.  I've had the #1, 2, and 7.  All excellent.  But the #2 with the fried egg was awesome :)))) Followed by the #7 Shaken beef.   The french bread is excellent and the sandwiches will leave you full and satisfied, unlike a certain unnamed competitor(large grocery store) in the east valley.  I'm gonna bug the owner until he opens a location up in the EV :)))))
