We've eaten here once or twice before and this time didn't disappoint. Despite being noon on Sunday, there wasn't a huge football crowd and we were seated right away. The salsa here is delicious and fresh. I ordered the fish tacos which were excellent - fresh and light. One thing I appreciate about Manuel's: when you ask for a side of something, you get plenty. My husband ordered a side of sour cream and got almost a cup's worth and I got three nicely-sized slices of lime with my tacos. They don't scrimp!

I tried Qdoba again after some time off because I had several not so great visits in a row. Again, completely disappointed in this restaurant. Their portion sizes seem smaller than before and combined with the increase in price, no longer feels like a decent value.  I ordered the Pick 2 with the gumbo and 2 tacos with chips and a drink. My food was barely at room temperature and the chips were stale. The service was also pretty cold and not welcoming at all. $13.42 for less than par, small portions of food? No thanks.   Considering the fact that it wouldn't take much more effort, I think I'll eat at Chipotle where I've never had any problems and stop giving Qdoba my business.

I previously had a really bad experience with a moving company so I went into this move very skeptical. David of Taurus Moving reassured me that his guys would take really good care of me. That they did!! Cory, Cody, and Drew were awesome, professional, hilarious (seriously, they had me laughing all day!), and didn't damage a single piece of furniture - completely unlike my previous experience of tears, broken furniture, 25 total hours of moving over 2 days, and super expensive. These guys did the entire move from storage to house and from my apartment to my house in 9.75 hours. I highly, highly recommend Taurus Moving!

I LOVE My Fit Foods!! I feel very lucky because the one at Tatum and Shea is right across the street from my work so I don't have to rely on fast food on those busy work days when I need something quick.   The employees there are friendly, helpful, and even supportive when we chatted about my goals. They always have a smile on their face and a friendly hello when I walk in.   I haven't tried everything (yet) but the few things I have tried have been fantastic. I love having fresh food that I just heat in my microwave - fast and easy! My favorites are the Lemon Turkey, Pollo Adobe Tacos, Chicken Corn Chowder, Shredded Beef Tacos, and the Good Morning Sunshine!   A great company, great service, and great food!

My favorite lunch place - when in doubt, go to McAlister's! The food is always top notch and of all the things I've tried, I've never eaten anything I didn't like. The Savannah Chopped Salad is a favorite as well as the Four Cheese Griller. The spuds are great ( huge) so I get it as the Choose 2 combo with a salad and half a spud and it's a perfect lunch. The service is always good and it's nice to be greeted as a regular. Oh, and the fresh, baked-daily cookies? A fabulous way to cap off lunch.
