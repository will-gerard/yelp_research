These guys are rock stars! They have the perfect balance of personality and professionalism. Adam met me on my way in and made the experience flow smoothly. Larry finished it off great, I love discount tire!

This company has terrible customer service as far as I'm concerned. They also made a firearm ammunition sale to me that was not according to federal law. I consider myself a reasonable person and understand people make mistakes. It is a very fun place to visit but their selling practices and and customer service on the management level are absolutely unacceptable.

Jill is awesome! Very professional and does a great job! Very easy to make an appointment and location is easy access! I will most certainly go back. Her facility is a comfortable environment and she ensures you're getting exactly what you want without the pressures and up sells of your typical day/med spa.
