I love the way it's set up with the main food court in the middle of the walkways to the gates and the rocking chairs are charming.

Very convenient and close by when cooking just isn't going to happen. Love the tacos and grilled sandwiches. There loyalty card is the bomb. Something free for joining and something free for your birthday. The service is awesome most of the time.

I used to like Del Taco but seriously? I heard the drive thru people having trouble because of the thick accent of the server and even though there was only one couple ahead of me, it took me ten minutes to get two tacos and a burrito. If I didn't have a coupon, I wouldn't have gone. I'll be throwing the other coupons in the trash. Just not worth the aggravation.

The only problem I've ever had here was they once gave me taco sauce hotter than I like. They always greet me with a friendly greeting at the speaker and the window. They've always gotten my order right. Good, fresh food. Can't pass up the Taco Tuesday deal.

I've been living here a year now and I have no complaints. The management is awesome and friendly. It's quiet and attractive. The only thing I have a slight problem with is the pigeons. They're everywhere. Took a while for me to get them to stop sleeping in my porch and I still need to figure out how to clean their mess.

I have to say I'm very disappointed in how this place has not lived up to what it was when I first moved in. They have the funds to make a new wall for the office parking area but it's been months since both gates have worked. Garbage stays on the grounds for days. The water goes off without warning. The plug for my microwave pops its circuit breaker. The plug for my bedroom lamp turns on by itself. There's no getting rid of the pigeons on my balcony where they make an awful mess.  The sidewalk and stairs too. The buildings are old and the upstairs heat up something awful. I've seen a few roaches in the last year. I know they're not because of me. I'll renew for now but they give me only one day to take their best offer. What if I was away for work? I really hate moving but I will if things don't improve especially since I'm getting less than what I came in for and paying more rent. For this higher rate I'm pretty sure I can find something better. SMH This place was so good the first year. What happened?

This place is turning ghetto since the management company changed. People loitering on steps,  shopping carts abandoned on the property,  clothes hanging from balconies, people smoking where ever, one excuse after another as to why the gate hasn't worked in months. The staff used to wear nice uniforms and be helpful and friendly. Now they choose what ever time to go to lunch so when you go to the office in the hot sun, they're not there.

I love Subway and not all of them still have the seafood salad. This one does and that's the only sandwich I get and I get it often so it's nice when  I'm remembered. I just wish they had a frequent visit card.

What a snooty store. I was followed around the whole time and asked if I was ready to ring up when I wasn't even at a register. Didn't have the bag of violet crumble that I was looking for. No need to come back.

I love my bbq, and this is one of the best I've had. Great quality food and awesome service. If you're a regular they know your name. Come back often, they have daily specials that are off the menu. Don't come between noon and twelve thirty, though. The line is out the door and there's no place to sit. That's how great this place is.

These burgers are huge and the fries are like the old fashioned crispy fries I used to get at Burger King. But this place is way better than any fast food. Best burger I've had in Phoenix and Sylvia and the other workers were very friendly. Good thing this place isn't close to where I live. I'd be there every day. They have breakfast and pies too that I'll have to try another time.

I first made a note of this place when it showed up on the Food Channel. So when I found that it was within walking distance from my hotel on an over-night, I decided to check it out. It was worth the walk.  Great tasting burger and sweet tea that hit the spot. But the reason I went was to check out the fried pickles. To date they are the best I've tried so far. The workers were eclectic and really nice. Service was right on!

This was my first experience with Pep Boys and I was taken there after a recommendation by Verizon who I got my tow truck from after I'd been in an accident.  They gave me the option of doing the repair that needed to be done but they recommended, no hard sell, a choice. So for two flat tires and two damaged wheels, I bought four new tires and two new wheels, the basics. Then they showed me my brakes, I knew they needed to be done. So they did the wheels and tires and brakes and the alignment and drive since the repair is awesome. I had the monies needed but they also offered me their card which I decided to take to help offset the cost. I'd recommend them and will go back.

When I first had a problem with my car I went to a National chain who not only obviously ripped me off but also tried to scam me with a 'front yard' scam job from an employee. So I came on Yelp and found the first review. So I took my car here instead. They did the job in the time they said they would and returned a part to me that I brought to them because the chain said I needed it. The next time I went, same great service and way less than I was told by the tow driver it would probably cost. So I took my car for a check up and again, great service done well and quickly. I have never been scammed and they are up front with everything so if you don't like what they tell you, you can take it else where. I would not be afraid to recommend them to anyone I know. I don't know where Kenny G. went but I've been here numerous times and they were done super fast and have never over charged me.

I love the shaded parking under the new solar energy panels. Can't say enough about the Hold service. Look online for the books I want, place them on Hold and get an e-mail when they're ready to pick up. Then I just walk in, pick them up, and scan them out. If I could just learn how to download the electronic books to my ipod I'd be thrilled.

This was never my choice of bank. They took over my bank years ago. Now they're saying other people can't make cash deposits to my account. What kind of bank doesn't accept cash? So I'm out. Wells Fargo was very friendly when I opened my account with them.

Horrible! Gave it two chances and the first night it took over an hour to get our food and they ran out of entrees. Both nights the food was just average. I could have gotten better quality at The Olive Garden and for less money. I'll stick to the buffet next time.

I've been a fan since I lived in L.A. It's a good thing it's in the opposite direction from work to home or it would become an addiction. I love the animal style or when I'm feeling good the protein style burgers. I like the way they make their fries and when I'm feeling really bad I order my fries animal style. I've never met a worker there that didn't look like they were enjoying their job. They all have great attitudes.

Awesome place. Awesome people. As a new patient,  they treated my Sasha like a long time favorite. Although I didn't have an appointment,  I was worried about her. They took her right in and got right on all the possible tests to find out what's wrong with her and how to fix it.

Not as good as the one in Los Angeles. It's pricey but expected in a place like this. Unfortunately this is the second time I've had bad service even before the other half of our six member party showed up. Just didn't feel it was worth the 18% gratuity they added on. I'll stick to Happy Hour.

I don't usually go out of my way to write a review but I just couldn't wait for this one. I wanted to make sure I remembered everything because if I could give only a half star, I would. I went there for lunch with two of my crew members. First mistake, we were waiting for a table and were forgotten about. Finally get a table and I ask for a seperate check, she gave all three of us seperate checks even though the two guys wanted theirs together. I ordered tea, the first guy I was with ordered half tea, half sweet tea, and the next guy ordered sweet tea. All three tasted exactly the same. Like very watered down sweet tea. Our glasses reached empty and stayed that way until we asked for a refill. We all ordered the Friday special, fried chicken. I ordered the shrimp chowder as one of my sides. Lots of fish, no shrimp in it.One of my friends ordered the side salad and they forgot his silverware. When we flagged down a waitress to get some, she didn't even apologies for the mistake. No matter that it's unhealthy, I love chicken skin but this one was so burnt it had that burnt crunch and burnt taste. I couldn't eat it. The chicken piece itself was unidentifiable as any piece I'm used to and so dry I had to put some of the bbq sauce they had on the table on it. The mac and cheese was good as long as it stayed hot. While fighting my chicken with a fork and knife because it was so hot, the mac and cheese cooled and got greasy. When  we got our checks all three were dumped in the middle of the table and they were all mixed up in the three black check folders. So bad we all went to Bojangles after. Should have just gone there to begin with.

Being from Hawaii, I was craving a plate lunch. Found this place busy with college students. What I liked was it was Koreans cooking Korean food. I got the kalbi and fish jun and lit smelled so good I couldn't wait to get home. When I opened it, it was just what I was craving. The kalbi was a little dry and tough and as much as I like mayo there was too much in the mac salad for me. The fish jun and other two sides were excellent. I'll be back for sure.

I will try catfish and southern food where ever I can find it and I had a Livingsocial for this place so even though it was out of my way I decided to try it. I don't like spicy anything but I have to say that I also thought this was the best catfish I've had. So much so that I had to go back and make sure I didn't think it was so good only because I was hungry. It was just as good the second time. This time I decided to try some of the sides. The mac and cheese was just okay, I've had better. The greens were just too bitter for me. I couldn't finish them. But I will definitely be back for catfish and try the BBQ next time. Very friendly people working there.

When I realized we'd be staying closer to Captain D's for the next three days, I was looking forward to it. I love seafood. But this was like going into your enemies house for dinner and ordering from someone who hates you. Shawntee was unbelievably rude and surely. Not to mention unkempt. A shame really. The food was really good and fresh. I would have liked to try their other choices. Because of her I won't be back. There are too many places around here to choose from.

Okay, since there's no Poi Bowl here not to mention all my other favorite places in Hawaii, yes I'm a regular. I usually go to the one on Thomas unless I'm doing my shopping up this way. But so far I've been disappointed every time with the rice. Who ever is cooking it doesn't know what they're doing. It's sticky rice, not chewy rice with hard bits. Other than that, I've only had my usual, chicken katsu, and with that I have no complaints although I seem to get more chicken at the one on Thomas.

I didn't actually stay here but I spent a lot of time there one morning when I had an accident right in front. The early morning security guard was a great help and the valet even came to check on me when it took forever to be helped and offered me some water. If everyone who works there is that nice,  I will make sure to recommend it to all my out of town guests.

I don't know how it is on weekends but I've gone twice on weekday afternoons and I love that you don't need quarters and that I can do my whole laundry basket at one time. Just a warning though. The dryers aren't very strong so make your loads a little smaller. For the price, it shouldn't be a problem.

One server, one cook, one guy making bread. Had a Groupon so didn't do the buffet. Ordered two dips and had to ask for more bread. Also had to flag down server to order drinks. A wait for our meals and not much meat that was dry and overcooked. Maybe dinner or the buffet is better but having been to that part of the world and had that food, I wasn't impressed enough to be back. My Groupon was for $40 so when I got my bill and it said a discount for less and the amount I figured I owed wasn't the same as what I was told, I asked the server. She said she couldn't help me because the owner did the bill and she couldn't fix it. Seriously? Not good!

I first tried Smashburger because I'd seen it on Facebook. So when I found it in Denver I decided to try it. Now I enjoy it in Phoenix. The one on Camelback has awesome service. The workers there are the bomb.  I enjoy the mushroom and swiss burger and the chicken sandwich. I like the veggie frites best but they have awesome fries. I've yet to try the sweet potato fries but I'll pass on the fried pickles. I've had better and the ones here are salty. Get a shake when you're feeling especially extravagant. They're made with real ice cream!

Maybe if we didn't have to wait an hour for our food and watch at least three different parties who arrived after us get their orders before us, I might give this place more stars. The food, when it finally arrived, was good but pricey. What got me is why the wait? You place your order at the front and pick up your own food. But what really got me was the girl that took our order gave us an extra drink and some popcorn but neither time did she apologies for the wait. Twice I went up to question the wait. Twice I was told ours was next. Twice it wasn't. Maybe a little more acknowledgment of the situation would have me giving the a second chance. But not after just pretending there was nothing wrong.

As always, awesome location and fairly friendly staff. There's room for improvement when the friendliest staff I came across was the maid.

My car was making a funny noise and was due for an oil change. I'd received a flier for Fletchers and it was nearby so I decided to check them out. They gave me the oil change for free when I found out that I'd need to change a leaky power steering fluid hose and all the belts since they'd been damaged by the fluid. It was quite pricey. But I understood it needed to be done. What I really didn't like was that when I went in for the oil change I was told I'd be called when my car was ready. I wasn't. When I showed up it was finished but it still took an hour of waiting around to get my car. Then when I brought it in a few days later for the repair again I was told I would be called once the other hose was checked for damage. I wasn't. I was told I'd be called when it was ready. Again I wasn't. When I showed up at least three of the workers looked at me and ignored me before I was taken care of. It's the Holiday Season and I have limited days off. I would have liked the courtesy of being told my car was finished. I probably won't be going back.

I've been using Groupon to find a salon where I will become a regular for my Brazilians because they are very private and expensive so I want them done well.  Although it was done fast here, I left feeling sticky and my Groupon came with their Swarovski Crystal Design but I didn't have the offer in front of me and I was told it would be another $25 so I declined. I thought it was unusual that the technician didn't leave while I was getting ready or give me a towel. I'll be looking for another place for this service.

What can I say? I first heard about it on Facebook. So when I saw it in Denver I had to try it. I've loved everything I've tried with the exception of their fried pickles. Too salty. But I have been a fan ever since and I tell everyone who isn't tired of hearing me yet how great their burgers are. I even like the chicken sandwiches. I've been to three different locations and the service has always been so top notch they must treat their employees really well.

It's well worth it if you go during their Happy Hour. Monday wasn't crowded. Good selection. I don't know how it is when the place is full but the selections were kept well stocked. Attentive but not hovering service. I will definitely go back to try the selections I was too full for this time.

Never saw this place and so I decided to check it out. Very interesting concept. The service was friendly.  I was asked if I'd been there before and when I said no I was walked through the process.  The sandwhich I ordered was very tasty and reasonably priced and they have three different sizes for their sandwiches.

I wouldn't go to this location at night by myself. The catfish was fishy and too much breading. I'll be sticking with Papa Joe's. The pizza was blah. Those $5 no wait pizzas taste better for less. It was something new nearby to try. It won't be a repeat.
