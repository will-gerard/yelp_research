Finally, another Indian restaurant in Phoenix worth praising (Udupi is my other spot) -- we stopped in after work this evening for a quick bite, expecting the usual bagged frozen veggies in watered-down curry.  What we had was a hearty, flavorful, fresh, vegetarian meal. There is plenty of meat on the menu as well.  My wife and I both ordered the Vegetable Korma, which was full of fresh veggies in a rich, aromatic curry. We tried two different breads -- one was doughy and stuffed with cauliflower and the other was a crispy whole wheat. They were totally different from each other, yet both were fantastic.  Each staff member was friendly, responsive and never devoid of a smile. A nice, intimate atmosphere, perfect for a quiet and economical meal.  I will certainly be back soon... and will consider becoming a regular.

From the outside, a strange looking place with a cryptic name. But inside it's a different story.   Vegans should be enamored by Loving Hut (I'm not vegan, but occasionally enjoy a vegan meal). The menu is as vast and diverse as a Chinese vegan menu can be. The "proteins," a.k.a. soy chicken, soy beef, and soy shrimp, should win oscars for best actor. Their consistencies and flavorings were great. I started with the fresh garden rolls and had a the New York stir-fry chicken entree. Both were fantastic.  The service was also a highlight -- our server took the time to explain the entire menu, and even offered her own recommendations based on our preferences.  It's a family-owned place, and I was proud to support them. Even though there was a TV streaming vegan propaganda in six languages, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and highly recommend this place.

I've been in the valley for almost a year and so far Sakana is the best sushi restaurant I've found (and I've been looking).   First, the bad: on Friday night I met some friends at 7:30 -- we were a party of 4 and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. The wait ended up being over an hour, due to a couple of large parties just camping out after the bill had been paid. Keep in mind, this is a small restaurant. It would have been appreciated if the staff could have dropped subtle hints to these patrons that there was a slew of people waiting for their tables.   Otherwise, the sushi is very tasty. The soft-shell crab roll is my personal favorite, and at around $9, an indicator that this place is easy on the wallet. Portions are large. Service has been consistently fast and friendly. The decor is simple and nothing ornate, making it feel like a nice  family restaurant. People were dressed in anything from gym attire to business casual.   Sakana is on the top of my mind when I think of going out for sushi in Phoenix.

I volunteered at the AZ Humane Society this past Sunday and it was an unforgettable experience.    First, I was surprised with the facility itself, which was incredibly new and clean... and huge.  They shelter dogs, cats, rabbits, and even horses.  The dog kennels were particularly impressive, as every dog has a decent-sized personal "home" with indoor/outdoor access, a bed, and a water fountain.  There is a large playground out back, where volunteers can take the dogs out to play and give them some exercise.  The staff was incredibly devoted to these animals and seem to do everything in their power to give them second chances and find them new homes.    I look forward to volunteering again, and am thankful for all of the work that these people do.

After living in AZ for a year I finally tried Grimaldi's pizza. Wow --   What I liked: - the thin-crust pizza served piping hot. Definitely up there with the best pizza in town. - the "make your own" style of the menu -- there's a based price for a pie, and each ingredient you add is about $2. - the wine selection (and prices). There are plenty of nice bottles for $20. - There seemed to be ample parking, which tends to be tough in this neighborhood.  What I didn't like: - the crowds and wait time at 7PM on Saturday, although I can see why it's worth the wait. - Lack of variety -- the menu could benefit from more salad options, for example - the bar area could be larger to better accommodate waiting customers

I finally got the courage to brave the epic wait for a Bianco pizza...twice.  Is all of the hype true?  Bottom line: Amazing pizza, but not worth the four-hour wait (both times I waited close to four hours).  I got in line at 4:30, waited almost 45 minutes to put my name on the infamous list, and then another 3.5 hours or so to get seated.  I was starving and tipsy by the time dinner was served, so a cardboard box would have tasted good by then.  The "Wiseguy" pizza is fantastic, and so is the pizza topped with onions and pistachios.  I've never had anything else like it.     If you are still motivated to try Pizzeria Bianco after reading this review, follow this advice --   Show up at around 5:15 to put your name in, and then leave for the next few hours.  See a movie nearby, or just go home and relax.  Make sure you call every hour or so to check in... sometimes the wait is shorter than they initially say, although it wasn't both times I was there.

Stingray's happy hour menu rocks. They have sushi rolls and appetizers for $4-$5, plus half-priced sake (all sake, which they don't explicitly state on the menu), beer, and wine. I recommend the shrimp shumai dumplings for an appetizer... fantastic.   The sushi was not the best I've ever had, but it's definitely more than acceptable. The Stingray Roll was my favorite. Service was great, and so was the ambiance. I'm excited to go back when the temperatures cool off and we can sit outside and enjoy happy hour for three hours.

I've been to Ticoz several times now and finally need to give this place the kudos it deserves.  Great food, unique cocktails, and outstanding service is what earned Ticoz 5 stars in my book. When we were first seated last night, we were accidentally overlooked by the serving staff for about 8 minutes. The host forgot to inform the server he had a new table. As a result, we received two free drinks and around 7 apologies from various staff. We weren't even waiting that long.  I had the paella, which was great, and my wife had the vegetarian tamales. Both were outstanding.   Happy hour deals are fantastic for drinks and apps.  I will be going to Ticoz more often.

Nice place to hang out with a margarita on a weekend afternoon. Great food and atmosphere, with mountain views and quietness. They even let us bring our dog to dine on the outdoor patio. Order the calamari for an appetizer -- I've never seen it prepared so well.   My only gripe was that they didn't offer happy hour prices outside... only at the bar, where nobody was.

Fuego is simply awesome -- one of those hidden gems in Phoenix for local foodies.  It was so good, I've now been twice in a week.  Happy hour is fantastic, with discounts on signature drinks and food. The service also doesn't disappoint.   No doubt one of the best latin places around town.

Mondays and Tuesdays at Radio Milano are "neighborhood nights," meaning you can get a salad and an entree, or a dessert and an entree for $20.    Last night was my second experience at RM.  Not only was the food superb, but I can't think of a single other place in this region or elsewhere where you can get a chopped salad and filet mignon for $20.  Everything was top-quality, including the service.  Great food, great wine, cool ambiance -- perhaps my new favorite neighborhood restaurant.

What a great place -  I stopped in for lunch on a Monday and was pleasantly surprised by the food, service and ambiance.  The outdoor patio is a tranquil space on a nice day.  The selection of "big salads" on the menu is great for vegetarians.  I ordered the chopped salad and was very happy.

Stopped in with a friend for an early happy hour. Appearances can be deceiving -- beautiful patio and indoor decor. We were one of only three parties in the place, so there was no excuse for poor service. Our server was a bit cold...he did not make a good first impression...and didn't know much about the wines we asked about.  The first wine my friend ordered was 'permanently' out of stock. (so why was it still on the menu?)  I may be slightly biased, using Postino's as my benchmark for local wine bars. We ordered a bowl of olives for $7, which was not only over-priced, but also reminiscent of the olive bar at Safeway, and tasted like they were freshly plucked from an aluminum can.  The wine I ordered tasted stale and was above room temperature.   I was excited to try Bomberos, and I might give it a second chance, but there are some easy fixes this establishment can perform in the meantime.

We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not comp'd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the "we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record" line.  Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told "he's out of town." The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized.

Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in this town.    What I liked:  The food: I started with the three-bean salad, which was fantastic. It was a mixture of fresh green beans, black beans and pinto beans in a semi-sweet dressing.  Great appetizer on for a hot summer day.  For my entree, I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos, which were also amazing. Three small corn tortillas (house made) topped with big chunks of flash-fried mahi, pickled red pepper, and a special sauce. My wife ordered the black cod for her entree and it was also insanely good.  The house-made guac is also a must-have at The Mission, as they prepare it at your table.  Another must-have is the grits -- make sure you order it as a side dish -- be prepared for serious spiciness though.  Someone else in our party had the pork shoulder tacos, which he loved.  The ambiance: very cool. dimly lit, modern, classy.  What I didn't like:  Service: Our server had a bit of an attitude, and they were also out of several things we wanted to order.  We arrived at 8:15 and they were already out of the main soup on the menu (five chile soup).    All in all a must-try for "fine dining" Mexican in Scottsdale.

Cool spot to stop for a drink if you're in the neighborhood.  This is definitely a place for cocktails, as opposed to other libations.  Signature cocktails are the way to go -- I had a cucumber-mint martini, which was very good.   The ambiance is modern and slightly Euro, and also very urban.  The absence of windows, dim lighting and backdoor entrance make SideBar feel exclusive.  There is no outdoor space, so this place might be a great option for hiding out on a hot summer night.

How has this place not garnered much attention? I'm thinking the location may be a culprit. This is an old-town-esque restaurant that ended up on the other side of the tracks. I met a friend for Sunday brunch and was surprised to arrive in an empty restaurant.   I'll begin by complimenting the jovial and attentive staff. They could not have been any friendlier or competent. Our server always seemed to be an earshot away, and this place is anything but quaint. Maybe it would have been different had the dining room been more crowded.  I ordered the frittata, which was prepared with farm-fresh vegetables and served with perfectly-roasted and spiced potatoes. My friend ordered a cobb salad that looked amazing, and he was impressed by the spices they added to some of the ingredients.  I was also impressed by the coffee they served, which was obviously freshly-ground and just brewed.  The atmosphere is ultra-modern and could pass for a West Elm showroom, though obviously more high-end. 5 stars for my brunch at Avalon.

If there was only a way to rate the W zero stars...  I attend gatherings at the W essentially when I'm compelled by friends. I've now been several times, and I'm now at the point where if I do go, I will do my best not to give them a dime of my money.   Pretentious is the theme here. The W is a souped up Westin with dim lighting and DJ Douchebag spinning his iTunes library -- why do they require six bouncers and two sets of velvet ropes just to enter the bar?    The last time I was there was a rainy wednesday. I arrived at 5PM to meet friends from out of town (who were hotel guests) for a drink. The roof deck bar was empty.  The pool (next to the bar) was empty.  After spending a wad of money on drinks and food, I left to walk my friend to her room, intending to be back in 5 minutes to hang out with some other friends.  Upon my return, I was denied entry by the bouncer who declared my attire as a "dress code violation." Apparently, you cannot wear shorts by the pool, in the summer. Keep in mind I was OK five minutes prior, but the sun was descending in Arizona and I was no longer welcome.    The bouncer allowed me to say goodbye to my friends, and then escorted me out like a criminal.  The bouncer actually apologized to me, but claimed there was nothing he could do unless I changed into pants.  I wasn't going to write this review, but I wrote a sincere, cordial letter to the hotel's General Manager and received no reply. This was four months ago.    I was back at the W last night for an event -- this time I was intentionally the designated driver.  They charged me $3 for a club soda.    Whomever runs the W needs to step down from the ivory tower and take a business class or two.  Customer service is more important than bottle service.

I took a ride on the Real London Bus and it was quite the experience. As far as I know, this is the only authentic and original double-decker bus in AZ. I've been to London, and this is the real thing.   The owners are two young, gregarious and energetic "chaps" named Jon and Reza, and they aim to please. You can hire the bus for just about anything. I was part of a small group and took a leisurely drive around Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon. The bus is BYOB and there is no additional charge for bringing anything on board. You can even bring your own music. The sound system they installed does not disappoint.  This bus gets plenty of attention from other drivers. I'm sure most of them are a bit surprised as they pull up along side of "big red," cruising at a break-neck top speed of 45mph on the 202. It's also an adrenaline rush on the top deck as you approach highway underpasses.  I'm pretty sure the Real London Bus can be booked for just about any occasion. I'd love to get a group together for a Cardinals game in the Fall. This rolling behemoth holds a maximum of 70 passengers, none of whom need to worry about getting a DUI.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is not your luxury mode of transportation. If you want to be pampered, hire a limo. This is a fun, unique and original idea, and an authentic British experience.   Rainy London meets sunny Phoenix. This bus is the epitome of juxtaposition!

From hair parlor to pizza parlor -- I found The Parlor to be a unique, high-quality restaurant, and a welcome addition to my Phoenix neighborhood. Here's my take:  What I liked:  - The food:  There are plenty of pre-conceived pies on the menu, but where this place shines is the emphasis on build-your-own.  You can choose either a 9" or a 12" pizza, which link to per-item charges for proteins and veggies.  I asked for my pizza extra-crispy, and it came out perfect.  The salads were also fantastic.  - The drinks: a decent wine selection and a nice variety of signature cocktails.  I ordered the Basil Gimlet, which was refreshing and a drink I'd love to replicate at home.  - The service: friendly and attentive enough during this visit. We didn't wait long for anything (except for a table, which was understandable on a Saturday at 7PM).  We waited 25 minutes, but those a few minutes behind us were told 45 minutes.  - The ambiance: The Parlor is in a building once occupied by a barber shop, and the proprietors chose to keep the spirit alive vis-a-vis the decor.  The artwork, props, and even the bar stools are reminiscent of The Parlor's past days as a salon.  I'm just hoping I never find any hairs in my pizza.  What I didn't like:  - While the cocktails tasted nice, the sizes leave much to be desired.  My basil gimlet was 11 bucks and looked like about 5 sips.  I was disappointed when I watched my bartender discard the remaining beverage left in the cocktail shaker after he filled my glass -- which reveals the problem: the small martini glasses must go.  Perhaps the owners can do a benchmarking study at AZ88 for proper martini glass sizes.  - The bar: a bit small for a place this size.  The Parlor has true potential for a great bar scene -- they just need to devote more space.  All in all a great place and I'm looking forward to going back.

I really wanted to like Tommy V's -- unfortunately this review will be less than flattering.  I'll begin with what I did like:  The happy hour drink specials: $5 glasses of wine, $3 beers, and $5 house cocktails from 5-7.  Not bad.  What I didn't like:  The pizza: The pizza tasted OK, but averaging around $15 per pie - which one hungry adult could easily finish -  was a bit outlandish. The quality was nowhere near that of The Parlor, LGO, or Grimaldi's. At those prices for "personal" pizzas, I'd expect to be wow'd.  The service: We were surprised to see only one vegetarian pizza on the menu (not including the standard cheese pizza).  When we asked the server if we could substitute veggies for meat on any of the pizzas, he acted like he's never heard this request before -- and he had to ask the chef.  His sanctimonious attitude about substituting artichoke for prosciutto was just odd. And when he finally allowed us to make the substitution, the pizza came out wrong.  We gave it a shot, but most likely won't be going back.

Old Town has a new kid on the block.  I've been to 5th and Wine twice now and I must confess I love this place.    Happy hour specials are fantastic -- $5 wines and $1 bruschetta (per piece), among other fantastic appetizer deals.  Speaking as a Postino loyalist, this place will give it a run for its money.  Postino doesn't include food in its happy hour menu, and Postino's happy hour ends much earlier (5:00 I think).  The first thing I noticed is how the owners know what they are doing.  As a new place, it's important to generate positive buzz with quality food/drink, great service, and pleasant atmosphere.  On both visits my servers went above and beyond the call of duty.  Great wine selection, too -- and some wines by the glass are $5 regularly.

Went in for happy hour tonight and really liked my experience -  Robust beer and wine list, half price at happy hour and reasonably priced regularly make TMI a worthwhile stop on the way home from work. And, gourmet food at very reasonable, regular prices really hit home for me -- my grilled cheese sandwich on fresh sourdough was a highlight.  If you're an olive fan, get the bowl of house-marinated olives for $3 -- they are intensely flavorful and are a great compliment to your wine.  The ambiance was also very cool -- in a 1920's house, dimly lit, and piping cool downtempo tunes gave the place a really chill vibe.  The outdoor patio will be great when it warms up a bit.  My only criticism is the bar.  Way too small for a place like this, with only about five seats.  If they truly want to entice the bar-goers at TMI, they will need to radically expand the bar.  Highly recommend for a casual drink, dinner or a get together with a large group of friends (the main space is very nice, and can accommodate larger parties).

Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood. Citizen is versatile -- the perfect place for a romantic date, a small gathering, or for just meeting a buddy for a drink. A place with a great vibe.  My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality. Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter. Every employee is attentive to every table. Our server was gregarious, accommodating, gracious, and highly proactive. We definitely felt the 'warm and fuzzy' atmosphere.  They pay attention to the little things -- such as house-made ketchup for your french fries.   The food: about as good as upscale bar food is going to get. For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes. Portions weren't large, but very high quality. The calamari was flash-fried and not greasy, and seemed very fresh. For my entree I had the wagyu burger, which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun.  Overall impression: Citizen will have staying power, unlike many establishments that open in Old Town. The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff, equip the place with great staff, and don't go overboard with prices. I'm looking forward to returning!

Last week I decided to check out Chick with my buddy on a Wednesday night at 7:30. As fans of the Grind (best burger in town), we decided to give it's avian cousin a shot.  It was an epic fail. They ran out of chicken after we ordered our chicken dinners. The manager was apologetic and discounted our bill 20% and comp'd dessert. I'm not sure if that's reparations or not -- I just know that we aren't eager to return. We ordered steak instead. We should have ordered the burger from the Grind next door.  The sides of veggies were good, as were the apps.  This might seem trivial, but as other reviewers have noted, the menus are a royal pain to read. It feels like a novel and you need elbow leverage to keep it open.   Winner winner, steak dinner!   Big let down, but hopefully they'll get their act together.

We tried OHSO for dinner tonight and could not have been happier with the food, beer, and service. For happy hour, you get $6 baby-pitchers of local brews -- good stuff. My wife (a vegetarian) had the Mediterranean Salad, sans meat, and loved it. I had one of the chicken flatbreads and it was delicious. I'd like to try almost everything on the menu.  The beer list is unique and unmatched from what I've seen so far in the valley. Service was outstanding. Give it a shot. I hope this place sticks around, because we will be back often.

JPG is truly a cut above the rest. We looked into several alarm providers and there was no doubt JPG is the best. Jim showed up on time to our home consultation and could not have been more pleasant, knowledgeable and forthcoming with all of the information we desired. Installation was the following morning -- our technician was professional and highly skilled. He talked us through the entire setup and installed everything per our requirements The technology they are using seems cutting edge, and I've never seen a system this advanced. Could not be happier. Highly recommend!

One of the best new restaurants I've been to in a while. A converted 1940s-ish Scottsdale home, this place has the Best ambiance--especially the outdoor patio. The brisket appetizer is amazing. I had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic. Can't wait to return!

Does Johnny Chu know who's greeting his guests?  Took my wife and toddler tonight -- instantly given a dirty look when I asked if they had a high chair.  "You're looking at a 20-minute wait, at least" said the abrasive hostess. "Would you like to wait?"  "Yes, we've been looking forward to your restaurant opening. We live down the street! Why such a long wait? I see at least ten open tables..."  "Oh, it's part of our grand opening. All of these tables are reserved," said the hostess.  [thirty minutes elapse. DJ in the booth cranks techno mashups from his Macbook Pro. Japanese anime triple-projected on the white wall behind the bar]  I politely checked back in, and the hostess gave me attitude, again. In a demeaning tone..."another ten-to-fifteen minutes." I solicited for some basic empathy considering that we have a hungry, and increasingly ornery kid.  She repeats: "I said, another ten-to-fifteen minutes."  Half of the tables retain "reserved" status. We probably would have been finished with our meal by now. It was obvious we were not wanted. Especially after my daughter pitched her sippy cup on the concrete floor and got the stink-eye from the mixologist.  We drove to 19th ave and enjoyed a meal at one of our favorite, family-owned places -- Thai Lotus.   Johnny... WTF?

Buyer beware: As previous reviewer stated, Green Street is flipping houses. We purchased a remodeled Green Street home and are dealing with significant issues -- plumbing, HVAC, and poor overall build quality. Our home inspector found many of the problems prior to closing, which were negotiated, but other problems were discovered immediately after move-in.   Superficially a very nice remodel. But lack of consideration for next homeowner, along with poor quality control is evident all over -- much of it beneath the surface. We have not found Green Street easy to deal with during any phase of the process, and cannot recommend doing business with them.
