Amazing doctors and staff! I worked with several doctors (Dr. Monson and Dr. Owens), who all were very knowledgeable and friendly. Mollie is with the staff, and she was extremely helpful with all procedures and questions.  I had Visian ICL surgery performed by Dr. Monson. He has excellent bedside manner and was extremely knowledgeable. He performed the procedure with great care and precision. Recovery from the surgery has been phenomenal, and I was back to work the next day! Within the first day I was seeing 20/20, and my vision is continuing to improve through the recovery period. Can't say enough about how amazing this surgery is!

This Cheesecake Factory provided some of the best service I've ever gotten at any restaurant. True to any CF, there's a huge menu and even bigger portions. The server was extremely helpful and very nice. Everything was served quickly and loved the atmosphere. Would highly recommend going there again!

I'll eat Joe's any day of the week. Great food selection, and everything tastes super fresh. Must see if you ever come to Arizona.

Awesome authentic Mexican food. There are several locations around the Arizona valley, but the original in Phoenix is the best.

Good food, not the greatest service.  I'll probably only go to SMG once ever. I ordered some really good steak quesadillas, stuffed with tons of meat. It was a moderately busy Monday night, but there were only two employees at the bar area. They were swamped with a lot going on, so they didn't do a great job of covering all the customers. Once in the theater, I hit the red service light to get a refill on my Dr. Pepper. Never got anything the rest of the movie.  SMG = great idea, terrible execution.
