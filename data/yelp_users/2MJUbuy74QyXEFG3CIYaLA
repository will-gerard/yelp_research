Words cannot fully explain what an awful experience I had at my most recent visit to this establishment. Having been here atleast 20 times, I convinced a couple of my friends to try this place for lunch. After we placed our order, the waitress confirmed our selections. When the food arrived, one of the meals was incorrect (the order was for a chicken dish, but the meal received was beef). One bite of the dish was enough for my friend to know he would not be able to eat it, so we sent it back and asked for something different. At this point I was not at all upset, as a former server I know that mistakes happen. After we ate, the waitress informed us that we would still be charged for the incorrect order as she insisted that shÂ¬e brought what we ordered. We could hear her arguing with the chef in Spanish about how she wrote the order down right, and that everything was our fault. I am fluent in Spanish, so I understood every insulting word that she said. We decided to speak with the owner, as we did not feel that we should have to pay for both the incorrect order AND the correct order (which by the way was terrible). I have never actually seen a restaurant enforce such a policy. The owner informed us that the mistake was by the server, and that he would remove it from the bill but she would have to pay for it herself. I told him that was not acceptable as mistakes happen. He continued to argue that she would have to pay, he even went so far as to call her stupid for making such a mistake on a slow day and that she needed to pay for her mistakes. His attitude was unbelievable, and his blatant disrespect for his female employees was beyond words. The owner makes the guy from the episode of Kitchen Nightmares featuring Amy's Baking Company look reasonable. If you are in the mood for Middle-Eastern food, try Haji-Baba, Curry Corner, or Sahara.

This place is amazing. The Friday/Saturday pork chop special is unlike anything I've ever had before... just make sure to get there early since it seems to always sell out early.
