I eat lunch here along with many people at my office about 2 times a week. The food is perfect, quantities are large and the price is right on spot.  The best part is the service and Kathrin who is there everyday I go is always the best.

Used to get greek twice a week but recently changed jobs so I tried Olivio's due to the fact they deliver. I ended up paying $18 total. $10.99 for the plate, $2.50 delivery Fee and $.89 tax. So $14 plus $4 tip.  For $14 I excpect to be pretty satisfied with a meal. I did not get enough food. The side of rice was about 2 spoonfuls. salad was also about 3 bites. the $14 I paid was not worth it. Food quality was good but I feel ripped off and still hungry. George's Famous Gyros gave me way more good food for about $8.   Not going to order again, maybe it will be worth dining in but I'm pretty dissapointed and still hungry so if you have an appetite I'd recommend another spot.

Candy was extremely helpful when I needed a new freezer for my restaurant. I called in the morning, she was quick to send pictures of numerous units and I found exactly what I needed. Very quick to respond and great service. Would recommend to anyone looking for deals on restaurant equipment.
