Well this has been one of my favorite courses since I moved here in 1988. I have played this course many, many times. However it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was excited to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement.   So I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.  I would rather remember Papago Golf Course as the great muni it was, rather then the course in disrepair that it is now.

The other two reviewers are right on target. This is a fine tobacco shop in every sense of the word.  And their prices are very competitive. They carry all of the best brands and have a large selection to choose from. My girlfriend bought me a travel humidor from there and it did'nt fit my ring size of smokes so I returned it and they couldnt have been more gracious about it.    The owner, Vartan is always dressed to the 9's and is an old school tobacconist in every sense of the word. He takes a fine smoke very seriously and knows his business.   Dell is person in Ambassador who is very professional and makes you feel like a king.  I would go there more often if it weren't just a bit out of my way.  Also the only other thing I can say about it is there hours are a bit limited.  I think they are only open until about 7PM most nights.  If I lived a little closer I would be in there all of the time. But if anyone asks my opinion I give Ambassador Cigars a very enthusiastic thumbs up!

Ok here is the deal with Red Devil Pizza.  The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot.  That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but  I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get.  I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on.  Actually I don't really have a reputation, but if I did I would lay it on the line for Red Devil Pizza. The long and short of it is, I am very passionate about their Pizza.  Period.

I tell you I never thought I would be writing a review for a car wash company. But I was just so surprised at the amazing job they did, I simply had to make a quick comment.   So I stopped at this place for gas on a Wednesday and they had a sign out front. "Wacky Wednesdays"  $6.99 for our basic wash.  I was sort of in a hurry but I thought, pretty good deal, get a quick car wash. Now for $6.99 I wasn't expecting too much.  Yes, they vacuumed the carpets, but other than that I was expecting what I paid for.  Also when I got out of my car and met the sales writer, I was all puckered up and ready for a high pressure sales treatment. I mean what car wash doesn't put the full court press on for a up sale? When I told the writer I just wanted a quick wash and I was electing for the Wednesday Special, he just smiled and gave me a ticket for the cashier.  Wow, that's it? No, trying to sell me a package of 10 washes?  Impressed already.  Then I paid for my wash and sat in the comfortable lounge and waited.  My car was done fairly quickly.  About normal waiting time of about 8-10 mins.    When I saw my car I was impressed that the wheels were really clean.  They didn't put any dressing on them because I didn't pay for it. But still it was very clean.  It was later that day that i looked in my back seat and saw a credit card laying on the back seat.  It was a credit card that I had lost (and called to cancel) about 6 months previously.  I would totally have expected some who finds a credit card laying under the seat of a car, to snag it.  But no, the folks at Arizona Car Wash Company gently laid it on my back seat.   Although the credit card was no good to me or anyone else at this point I was just so impressed by their honesty and integrity. Plus is was the best $7 dollar car wash my car has ever had.    I highly recommend this place.  You wont be sorry.

I have been to this place a few times because friends were already there and talked me into meeting them there. I have never really thought much of the food but it was not bad enough to write a review about. How bad can you mess up mexican food? But recently I dined at Julio G's and the experience was enough to inspire me to share.  First of all the decor has always bothered me there.  Pink Neon reminds me of some 50's diner.   I always expect to see a Milk Shake on the Menu when I sit down.  Also on this must recent visit I had really poor service. It was only slightly busy but it took an inordinate about of time to get a simple combo dish out.    They thing that stuck me most about Julio G's was how expensive it was.  Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish.  Actually I think a 2 item combo was like $10.95 and a 3 Item was like $11.95.  Man, $12 bucks for some marginal Mexican Food? I realize prices have gone up on food and produce.  I am sort of expecting to see some price increases across the board at some of my favorite spots.  But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food, service and overall dining experience.

Love this place.  Just stumbled in yesterday and Judy the bartender made me feel welcome like I had been a regular for years.  They don't have a huge selection of liquor but they have all of the essentials and they have enough high end stuff to make me happy. I dont think as a bar you need to carry every vodka known to man but I would like to see something more than Smirnoff and Stoli.  Although I am not a smoker myself, their back patio is really cool. Again not the nicest patio in the valley but I love that they make the most of this small space with creative furniture and a real cozy feel.  They have a ton of board games which I think is really great.  They have a few dart boards,  a necessity for any bar.  I think they thing I like most is Judy was telling me about all of the fun activities and events the owners plan for their customers.  I guess when Betty White hosted SNL last spring they had a big viewing party there.  And this past Monday Night during the Packers-Bears game they had Brats for the Cheese-Heads and Real Chicago dogs for the Bears fans.  What a creative and fun idea.   Another thing I live about this place is a wonderful, 30 ft long wooden bar. You have got to see this thing.  It's fantastic.   I guess the only think I can think of why they dont get 5 stars is because they dont open until 2pm every day.  I am sure there is a good reason for it. but with slightly limited hours I can't give 5 stars.    Having said that I think I will roll over for a drink about now. I am really going to love going to this great neighborhood bar.

This is what I get when I just drive by someplace and drop in.  I had a crazy hankering for Chinese last night so I deviated from my normal practice of researching a place before I go there and I am especially careful when it comes to Chinese places.  So I guess I got what I deserved when I made an impromptu stop at the Golden Wok.   This place hit the home run of bad restaurants.  Over-priced, bad service and horrible food!  I could have had PF Changs for what I paid at Golden Wok. We ordered Lettuce wraps and the food was cold and I swear the chicken must have been 3 days old. Awful.  Then I ordered Chicken Corn Soup because I love the way Abacus Inn in Phoenix makes theirs.  But again, the chicken was tough and the soup had no flavor.  Then we got our entrees.  I had Lemon Chicken.  I won't even go into how bad it was.  Just go to your local supermarket and buy a frozen sweet and sour dish and you will get the idea.  All of this cost me $50 and I drank water.    When you are in a location like they have you have to do something compelling to bring people to your restaurant.  Value priced food, exceptional service, or fresh ingredients.  But Golden Wok just wants to be another bad Chinese place. Just like 10,000 other places in strip malls in the valley.

I guess should not really leave any stars since I didn't actually get to try it.  Drove out of our way to visit this establishment. Like supporting local FroYo and wanted to get away from the large franchise players. Arrived at 9:40 on a Saturday night. Posted hours are until 10:30P. Arrived to find chairs up on tables and doors locked. Staff inside busy putting items away.

I am going to try to keep this short because I could easily go on and on about how good this place is. Service, food, decor all excellent.  Everyone else who is offering reviews is doing a nice job of talking about the food so I am going to mention a few different items of interest.  But about the food I will just quickly mention if you are having breakfast it may sound unusual but get the meatball as a side dish. It blew me away.  Not only does Liberty market offer Gilbert residents quality food, they do it at a reasonable price.  For a long time the Johnson family has been giving away free meals once a year at their flagship restaurant Joe's BBQ, right across the street.  In keeping with that tradition of bringing residents together they are offering a "Community Dinner" at Liberty.  The concept being that 30 residents can sign up for a dinner consisting of 5 or more courses including a chef's surprise course.  All for one very affordable price. The community part is that they sit you at a table of 6 or so offering diners an opprutunity to get aquinted with thier neighbors.  The dinner is limited to just 30 people on a frist come, first serve basis. Wonderful idea.  Earlier I was bragging about how good the meatball's are. I understand they have a Meatball sandwich which is not on the menu. Also not on the menu is a breakfast burger which is only served on the week ends between 11 and 1.  Not only does this dish sound wonderful but a menu item that is only available 4 hours a week has a strong allure for me.  While I was leaving I was looking at the pictures on the wall and I noticed that the family was pictured outside of the famous Culinary Institute of America Greystone.   I noticed that my waiter was pictured and after tracking him down again I find out that he was a family member, Willie Johnson, how unpretentious.  So that explains some of the good food. They have a strong background.

I went there for the first time on Tuesday.  I have been there twice more in the past 3 days.  I love this place.  But after eating there 3 times now I think I love the bar more than the food.  I think it's awesome that this killer rock bar serves Chinese food until 2am seven nights a week. Also the people that work there are "OUT OF THEIR WAY FRIENDLY".  But the food itself is about average.  I have only had 3 things on the menu so far so I will continue to plow through until I find the one dish I really love.  I will be going back because the place is so freakin cool.

Truth be known I secretly want to dislike the Kierland Golf Club but I can't. I have been playing this golf course for quite a few years and I remember what the course was like before the Resort Hotel was built.  I remember this great 27 hole layout and the friendly staff who worked there.  It was a little gem in the heart of Scottsdale.    Then the Westin Hotel was constructed and everything changed.  The prices went up, The course became much more difficult to get a tee time at, and the staff seemed to look at local players as a bit of a minority. Catering exclusively to the high rolling hotel guests and their expense accounts.    But for some reason I seem to play pretty well there.  The course sets up well for me and some of my lowest scores in years have been tallied there.  So I keep coming back. And then I realize it.  The course has benefited from the hotel being there.  The course is always, always in excellent condition.  The 27-hole layout is both challenging without being obnoxious in difficulty.  The staff and service is good and I love the practice facility.  It can be expensive but it's worth it.  This Scott MIller design was always a good course but you though a decent agronomy budget behind it and it's a great course.  The greens never have a mark on them. The Acacia nine is a great test of golf and where else can you find Johnny Walker Blue Label Scotch on the beverage cart?  If  you get a chance to play it you will not be disappointed.

I tried, I really tried. I wanted to like Two Men and a Pizza.  Clever name, close, independently owned.  I called them because I got a flyer on my door and they had a great special, 14 inch cheese pie for $5.00.  When I found the place it was small, clean and the person at the register was nice.  He told me all about their other offering, wings, sandwiches, deserts.  I love supporting small, family owned pizza joints.  When I got my pie I was excited to get it home and try it.   One thing I do not like about pizza is when the crust is soft and chewy.   I like a crisp crust.  So a few weeks later I thought, "Well maybe I just should have specified" that I like it "Well Done"  so I thought I would try it again.  my order came to $12.50 for a pizza AND 10 wings.  What a deal!  Only this time the crust was even more chewy and soft then before.  Very disappointed.  They are very nice people.  Perhaps I will try a sub sandwich from there sometime.   But I am done with their pizza.

Lot's have already pointed out the many great things about KO's but here are a few more.   1. They have fun and unique events.  Like King Kamehameha birthday, where they had a Hawaiian themed party.  White Trash Night, $1 PBR's and Schlitz. On Kentucky Derby day they have Mint Julep's and other fun drink specials.  Not to mention the St. Patrick's day blow out.  2. The food is very good as many people have mentioned, but my favorite thing on the menu is Harold's Green Chile and eggs.  I love this dish for breakfast with fresh tortillas and black beans.  Awesome!  3. If you live in one of the many apartment communities in the vicinity they have a free shuttle back and forth to your front door. That is very handy , and the driver John is a heck of a nice guy and a great driver.  Oh, and one more thing about the shuttle bus.  Great name.  "The Lord's Temple"  they bought it from a church.  What once was a shuttle hauling the faithful to Sunday school now carries drunks home safely.  What could be better than that?

So I eat at KO's like 2 or 3 times a week for lunch. But a guy has got to mix it up occasionally and get outside the box.  So twice this week I ventured off to other places in the Airpark for lunch.  What does this have to do with KO's you might wonder? Well it reminded me of what makes a great restaurant.  All of the restaurants in the airpark are busy at lunch time. What makes Kevin and Jim do such a good job is that they have enough staff on duty to handle the amount of customers they have. They are adequately staffed.  Twice this week when I was cheating on KO's I had to wait and wait for my check to arrive.  I never have that problem at KO's. Also my drink never gets below half empty before they top me off.  I can't eat at KO's every single day of the week. I try, but on the days I don't I always regret it.

This place is OLD SCHOOL great.  Classic tavern.  Cheap drinks and no fu-foo stuff.  Not a great selection of liquor but they have the basics.  Surprisingly they have Stella Artois on tap.  Of course many of patrons were drinking PBR the night I was there.  They have one pool table and just a few booths to lounge at.  I love the flouresnt, black light powered posters that hang high on the walls near the back of the bar.  And my favorite piece of art is the old and very large hula dancer that hangs over the back of the bar.    Another one of my favorite things about this bar is they have a juke box and they turn it up pretty loud. Love that.  Also this is classic. They have two small tv but no cable. What bar does not have cable TV.  I love it

Great little place.  Lots of fun stuff like four pool tables, video games, darts, etc. and looks like they have a pretty cool Rock Band Set up.  The best part about this bar is the .99 cent hamburgers.  It was actually a pretty decent burger.  Came with all of the condiments and a few chips.  Way more than I expected for a .99 burger. Another reviewer commented that there is no draft beer, which is fine with me.  They have a decent selection of good bottled beer including.  Stella, Guinness and Steinlager.  You dont need draft beer when you have a decent beer selection.  They also have Absinthe which you dont see a lot of bars have.    This is a drinkers bar.

I played Red Mountain Ranch Country club a few times in the late 1980's  when I first moved to Arizona. I love Pete Dye golf courses and this one was no exception.  In the 80's the golf course was semi-private, meaning although they had a membership base they also allowed non-member play.  Hence my 2 or 3 rounds Circa 1988.  Shortly after that the course went all private and my playing days at Red Mountain were finished unless I bought a home in the community.  Since I was only 23 years old at the time that was pretty unlikely.    Fast forward to last weekend. I discover that like many private clubs in the valley the golf course is allowing some public play in the summer time.  So after a 20 year hiatus, I returned to Red Mountain Ranch Golf    Club to find it in exactly the same way I remembered it, Fun!   The golf course was in pretty good shape for mid-August.  No golf course in Arizona is in great shape this time of year.  For golf course maintenance staff the goal is just to hang on and not let it get too bad.  I was impressed with the greens and fairways.  Again, a few brown spots here and there, but overall excellent compared to other courses this time of year.  The golf shop staff was friendly and professional.  Although it was 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the beverage cart was still making regular visits.  Many golf courses stop on course beverage service after 1 or 2 in the afternoon in the summer.  I guess when there are less then 10 players on the golf course it doesn't make sense.  But it was nice to see the beverage cart occasionally.    As far as the course itself? It's rated at 147 from the tips and 131 from the blue tees.  I dont remember it being that difficult of a golf course.  Of course I didn't know what slope and rating was back then either.  It's a fairly short course being only 6600 yards from the tips and 6100 or something like that from the Blue Tees.  But lots of sand, elevated greens, water and other hazards make for plenty of challenging shots.  I used every club in my bag that day and that is the kind of golf I like.  My buddy even teed off a few times with 6 Iron.  I like courses that make you think when you are standing on the tee box.  Rather than just reach for the driver every time.   Love this course. Hope to play it a few more times before the members return from their summer homes and relegate us weekenders back to the municipal course in the valley.

I have been going to Carlsbad for years and it is one of my favorite places in the valley. I have read a lot of the reviews and one thing is noticeably absent and that is any  comments on their Tortilla Soup.  It is the best in the valley as far as I am concerned.   Another thing I have noticed a lot of previous reviews have mentioned is the water feature.  Some like it, some don't.  It may be helpful for some people who have not lived in valley for a long time to know that in it's previous life the building that Carlsbad Tavern now occupies was once a seafood restaurant called Pier De' New Orleans or something like that.  You can vaguely see as you walk into the restaurant the old motif of a seaside pier, and the bow of the boat was the main dining room.  So Carlsbad Tavern inherited the water feature and kept it as part of their dinning experience.  I like it and just wanted to shed some light for anyone who might find it odd or out of place.

I have been going to this hard to find place for years.  It was recommended by a friend from the frist moment I bit into the crispy crust I was hooked.  I will talk about the food in a moment but my favorite part of Classic Italian is that I have introduced some other friends to this place and they went on to be hard, hard core regulars.  Dinning there a few times a week for about five years now.    The pizza is European Style.  Individual pizza, thin crust with fresh toppings.  I especially love the fresh Prosucitto and basil pie.  Their Tomato salad is excellent and the bread sticks and mariana sauce is some of the best in town.  Love it!

Reviewing Mexican Food Restaurants in Phoenix is a little like sports talk radio folks trying to compare boxers.  There are so many differences.  How do you compare a boxer in the heavy weight division to a boxer who fights in the welter weight division?   How do you compare a light weight to a super-light weight? It's hard.  and it's difficult to do with Mexican Restaurants as well.  When attempting to talk about boxing there is a term people like to use, "Pound for Pound", meaning if they weighed the same, this boxer would be superior.    "Pound for Pound" the Tee Pee is my favorite Mexican Resturant in the Valley.  Sure, there is a place in Scottsdale that has Green Corn Tamales that are to die for.  LOS DOS, in South Phoenix makes some killer dishes with Hatch Chilles.  But overall if I could only eat at one Mexican food place the rest of my life The Tee Pee would be it.   The Green Chile Burros are excellent.  The Margs are fantastic and everyone I have ever taken there loves the Salsa.  I especially like the Cheese Crisps and when ever I go there I just ask for the daily special, which they have been serving for like 50 years.  A Taco, Enchilada, Tostada combo.  Wonderful.  Check out the Tee Pee, a family run restaurant who is serious about their food.

Went to Chelsea's Kitchen for the second time this past weekend.  I wanted to try it again to be sure that my first experience was as good as I had remembered it. It was so I have deemed it review worthy.   Saturday night it was crowded but we felt comfortable sitting at the bar and enjoying some sparkling lemonades while we waited.  The wait was about 25 mins but it went by quickly and when finally seated I found the service to be good.   The food was good, not memorable but good. I had crispy chicken and my companion had the short rib tacos.  The chicken was prepared well and the rib tacos looked good as well.  I like Chelsea's Kitchen and would recommend it.

This is not a real review but simply a comment about service.  I went to Flemings at DC Ranch this past weekend after a reception earlier that evening.  Because I had eaten earlier in the day and I was with a group of people I didn't plan on eating at Flemings but simply having a glass of Scotch on the patio.   While we were being seated I asked someone who later I found out was the manager if he knew anywhere I might be able to find a cigar at this late hour of the evening.  We both speculated about the likelihood of some places in the vicinity being open and we both agreed that if would be a difficult task of finding someplace open nearby.  Upon which the manager  told me he personally did not smoke cigars but had one available that was a gift to him that he would be willing to give me.  I protested and was not willing to take a cigar from his personal property, but he insisted and I continued to offer my thanks but it was not necessary. I thought the matter was closed but a few minutes later he returned and placed the cigar, an ashtray and his business card down in front of me.  Impressive display of service.  You can be sure the next time I am looking for a good steak I will be thinking about Flemings at DC Ranch.

I went to the Airpark location for my AZWINECO experience. I have driven by this place a million times.  I usually find smaller wine stores to carry an eclectic variety of wines and usually I find them to be pretty expensive.  My perceptions were proven to be way, way off.   First they have some really really great wines in here. Tons of Bordeaux and the prices are not only compitive I would say they are inexpensive for they types of wine they carry.  Also the space was much larger than I expected. There is a large warehouse in the back that is unseen from the parking lot allowing for about 3 times as much retail space as I expected.  The staff was friendly and very knowlegage.  Also I mingled with some  other patrons who were enjoying a glass of wine and they were also wine enthusiasts.  They also carry a small but interesting line of imported beer. It is always fun to drink with and meet new people and that is exactly the experience I had at AZ Wine Co.  I wholeheartedly  recommend it.

I have been to Monkey Pants a few times now, mostly for drinks only.  Recently I had a chance to eat some of the food so it's time to chime in on the full experience.  I love the creativity of the place.  Crazy promotions like, Fish races on Thursdays, shirtless shots at 1, wearing sombreros for discounted tacos and other similar wacky ideas make the atmosphere fun.The prices are reasonable and they always have great specials.  They have a ton of burgers on the menu. My friends who have sampled them say they are very good.  I have had the wings a few times and I have to say they are better than average.  Recently I had the Spanking Monkey Sauce, Grilled.  A combo of the BBQ and Buffalo sauce combined.  Very Good.  I have also had the Tacos, Although they are very generous with the taco meat, filling the shell more than halfway to the top. The taco meat itself was only average.   Another thing that was unfortunate for me and I am sure it was an isolated incident, but recently when I was there the service was below average.  Not that she wasn't trying, but our waitress was apparently working alone and it took over an hour and a half  from start to finish to eat a quick meal.  We waited an inordinate amount for service, delivery of order and check to arrive.  Other than that, but place was terrific. Go check it out for yourself.

I live in Scottsdale, but have used Franklin documents  for 5 years now when ever I have business in Las Vegas.  Recently the higher ups at my company threw me a curveball and wanted some printing done with almost no notice.  Amber, Wendy and the folks over at Franklin made me look real good.  I will be using them when ever I need something in Las Vegas.

This place is a decent local watering hole. The people who hang out there are nice enough.  But I should never have to beg for a drink.  The bartender was too busy chatting up with some guys at the end of the bar that she could not be bothered to get me a drink.  So I went back to the patio sans drink.  My friends ask why I didnt get a drink? Because I don't want one so bad as to have to beg for it.  So rather than leave they talked me into waiting.  Eventually got drink.  Time to get drink #2. Went through the same process again.  So now I am thinking it's just me she is ignoring.  Then some other friends came in to join us.  My buddy sits down next to me at the bar and after about 5 mins of waving his hands in the air he turns to me and asks, "What does a guy have to do to get a drink around here"  Me: "Welcome to 92nd Street Cafe"

Sammy has been cutting my hair for years.  He is absolutely, "THE MAN"  he does such a great job and he is fun to be around. When ever I come out of his shop I just have this big ole grin on my face, I don't know what it is.  For years I have heard how women like to go to the salon and make a day of it.  Now I know what they mean.  Getting your haircut from Sammy and the boys is more of a social experience.  It's like hanging with the boys.   Enough about Sammy, here are some of the features of the place.   They always use great products and items like straight edge razors to shave your neck and hot towels.  Fantastic. I would never even consider going anyplace else.

Probably one of my favorite patio's for a bar in the valley. Sitting outside at sunset, looking at the McDowell Mtns is a great reminder of  why we live in Arizona.  The food here is really good.  I especially like the Shepherd's Pie. They have a great selection of booze. Nice single malt line-up and Boddington's and Smithwick's on Tap.  They have two sets of Corn-Hole Toss games on the patio.  Really, really fun to play. Watch out for the occasional hustler looking to drink for free off of your lack of corn-hole toss skills.  Soon they are suppose to have a shuttle service to give you a ride home. Once that is in place it will seal the deal as one of my top 3 bars in the valley.

I had high hopes for this place. I read the reviews about service and I thought that might be an issue and it was.   I like to look around at other peoples plates as I walk in and everything looked really good.  We ordered and when I food came they gave us the wrong dishes.  My wife got mine and I got hers. We both had chicken dishes but with different sauces.  Mine spicy, hers milder.  I thought that the plates look like they should be switched around but when the server sat them down he announced the correct dish. As a matter of fact my wife's came out about 3 mins ahead of mine. So he announced the name of the dish correctly as he sat it down before us.  All through the meal I keep thinking something is wrong.  I kept asking my wife, "How is it" and she would reply,  just OK. Then finally after I consumed about 80% of my meal I took a bit out of my wife's dish. Sure enough, I knew for sure then.  She has my spicy Black Pepper Chicken. Had I discovered it earlier I would have said something. A little ticked off that they told me the wrong dish as they plated it.   Also there was no forks anywhere and when I asked for one I got a bit of attitude it seemed.  Thinking of going back.  The two bites I took of my wives dish was good. I ate an order of something I didn't like, didn't order and yet consumed. Disappointed for all the wrong reasons.

I took my computer to RedSeven recently when my friends were calling and telling me I had a nasty virus that was sending out gobs of email every fifteen mins.  I had no idea my computer was infected.  I was hesitant to do so because I needed my computer to do some work. No worries, the fellas over at RedSeven hooked me up with a loaner.  I was able to get online and get my work done and get my home PC back the next day without missing a beat.  I was going to take my computer to one of those BIG BOX store repair places. I am so glad I didnt.  A friend of mine took their PC there and when it came back all of their family pictures, music and email was gone.  I will only be using RedSeven in the future and I suggest you do the same.

I used to love Bevmo, still like it, but my love affair with Bevmo was short lived.  I dropped her like a cheap prom date when Total Wine moved to town.  I love this store.  I will spend hours and hours there.  I have found some real bargins on hard to find wines.  Also I am a big Red-Blends guys.  Most places don't carry blends and if they do, they only carry a few.  Imagine my surprise when I found an entire aisle devoted to nothing but Red Blends.    Also nobody ever comments about this, but they have a pretty decent cigar humidor as well.  It's not great because it's pretty small. However I remember the last time I was in there I was thinking to myself, what impressed me was if I had only a limited space to display cigars in a humidor these are the brands I would carry.  The selecition is surprisingly good and the prices are great.    PS, ( I realize all wines are technically blends so if you are a professional wine sommelier don't be emailing and correcting me. You knew what I meant)

I was looking forward to visiting the Mission for a long time.  Finally, I made it last Friday just in time for happy hour. The patio was crowded but not quite full.  The hostess was reluctant to sit us on the patio, perhaps because we mentioned we may not be ordering dinner. That is fair, I can understand keeping the premium sitting open for larger parties or people certain to order entrees. So we took at seat at the bar. The place looked really nice and I was impressed by the selection of premium booze behind the bar.  Unfortunately we never got a chance to experience The Mission. After sitting at the bar for somewhere between 5 and 10 Mins we were yet to be acknowledged.  All the while staff is busy swirling around us. So when we decided that the Mission did not want our patronage, we got up and left after never being spoken too.  Then the hostess who sat us at the bar just 10 mins prior gave us a big smile as we left and said, "Come back again".  Not likely friend. I guess my money is not good enough for The Misson. I give it two stars simply because everyone else's plate looked good.

With 83 reviews you are not going to learn a lot from my review that has not already been said.  So I will just add this.  They have a great selection of booze that you don't see a lot of around town. For starters they have an Absinthe Fountain. Don't  see a lot of that. They also have two different flavors of Chimay Beer.  Very rare to see that in a bar cooler.  They have one of my favorites, Dead-Guy ale and their wine selection was decent as well.   After all of these selections, what did I drink when I was there?  Single malt Scotch.

I have loved this place for over 20 years.  I have always loved the atmosphere and the way it opens up to the civic center sidewalks.  Very Cool.  The only thing that I didn't care for so much was that it was mostly an older crowd and pretty sedate and low key. (Not that being old is bad, remember I have been going to this bar for 20 years) But something happened when the new owners came in and changed the name. The crowd is much more fun then it used to be.  Not rowdy or obnoxious but just fun, nice people.  You can say all you want about this bar has cool drinks, or this bar has nice furniture, or this bar is inexpensive or whatever. Here is the bottom line on Brackin's.  When I am there, I feel comfortable. PERIOD.    It's like listening to an old record that feels like you have heard it for the first time all over again.  Oh and I love the new little meatballs they serve there.

Two quick points about American Dry Cleaners.  1. After only the 2nd time in there they remembered my name and how I liked my shirts done.  2. Today I went to pick up my clothes and I had left some cash in one of the pockets.  It was stapled to my receipt when I picked up my stuff.   I think that says all you need to know.  Oh, and they do a good job with my stuff

Finally went to Barrio Cantina last night. Have been wanting to go for some time now.  The decor inside is very contemporary and yet reminds me of old world Mexico at the same time.  The service, (Matt) was exceptional.  The menu offers a wide variety and the prices not bad.  I tried the Tilapia El Rojo because I am a sucker for grilled corn.    I had a few house margaritas as well. Not too bad.   If you're in the area check the place out.  I liked it.

I read all of the Yelp reviews.  I called them for a quote and they were professional and polite.  I was expecting them to be good since my they were so highly regarded on Yelp. So I scheduled a small move ahead of a larger one sort of as a test drive.   I cannot begin to explain how good these guys are at what they do.  As with any business it's the little things that set apart good companies from great ones.  They packed my belongings so carefully that is was amazing.  They accidentally packed 2 items that were to be left behind, (My fault) and when we went to retrieve them before loading the truck, they were so carefully wrapped it was amazing. They were on time, their quote was competitive and they did what they said they would do.  I would highly, highly, highly recommend Just-in time movers.

Troy has done a number of projects for me ranging from painting a building to some light wall repairs.  Every time a new project comes up I think I am going to call him and stump him with something he, "Can't Do".   I am still waiting for that response.  Most other tradesmen I have ever met are driven strictly by how much money they can make and how fast they can complete the job to move on to the next project.  Troy is super obsessive about customer satisfaction.  After your project is complete expect him to follow up several times to make sure you are completely, 100% satisfied.

Had a big hankerin for some BBQ today and I had driven by this place a few times so when the craving came, Notorious P.I.G was on deck. . While I was driving over I checked YELP and was concerned by a few less than spectacular reviews. I should remember the creedo, "In YELP I trust"   I have to agree with the other reviewers.  It was not so great, but I cant pin down exactly what it was that I didn't care for.  The brisket as a little spicy and the beans were like something I could get out of a can. The cornbread seemed a little dry.  I hate to give a place two stars because I know behind the scenes this is someone's livelyhood.  Someone's baby. But I have to call them as I see em.

I used to be in the golf business and this course had sort of a bad rap.  But that was a long time ago and I have been curious so I have played this course a few times in the past few months.  First of all, I don't know if it is the new management or just a myth but this course is actually in pretty good shape, even in the summer months. Anyone can grow grass in January but I have to say that I have been impressed with course conditions the few times I have played there.  Not only that but it's a fun course to play.  I have been accused of being a little finicky about the courses I play. I like a challenging course but don't want to beat my brains out for 18 holes.  I like holes that are different and unique but I don't like tricked up or gimmicky holes.  And this course is just plain and simple a fun track.  it's a pretty good value as well. I have been practicing there a lot lately and they have a pretty decent practice facility as well.     One last thing.  The staff is very good.  Very friendly.  Go try Stonecreek.  It may not be the nicest course in town, but I bet when you are finished you will look back and say you had a good time. And that is what golf is suppose to be about.

I often wonder why people who visit the Coffee Bean are there?  I mean there is a Starbucks on every corner. Why not just go there?  Then I realized they must be there for a very specific reason.  I received a gift card to Coffee Bean so I started going because of I got a few cups of free coffee.  Let me tell you why I will be going back and going out of my way to visit this location.    For some reason the coffee just tastes better there.  They only serve low-fat milk in all of their drinks so I don't need to specify each time.  Their service is outstanding.  I mean really, really outstanding.  I think their food menu is well conceived and although I have just begun to try different kinds of tea this is the place I want to experiment.  I know that when I am ready the staff at Coffee Bean will guide me in the right direction.

Everyone is doing a fine job of detailing how they use fresh ingredients and have a good assortment of flavors so I don't need to reiterate that.  I will tell you one thing about Yogurtology that I have noticed that distinguishes them from other Fro-Yo places.  First of all their toppings are about twice as big as any other place I have been to.  Very large pieces.  Which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  I think it's a good thing.  Two: Their customer service is very good.  I have been to other places that just sit and wait for you to dispense your product and grab your money.  The folks at Yogurtology engage each customer as they enter the store and go out of their way to assist and educate their customers.  One day I was in there by myself and I witnessed this for about 30 Mins.    One only slight, slight issue I may have is that although their topping sizes are large, as mentioned before, the number of topping offerings is about average.  Probably due to counter space. I have been to some other larger spaces that have toppings bars that rival a salad bar.    Love this place.  I will frequently will drive out of my way to go there.

Watched the Ignite Phoenix #7 viewing party here on Friday Night. Thanks for hosting.  Had a lovely Americano while I watched.  Great drinks and cool interior.  The other guests seems to be talking about their food as being very good.  This is a little out of my neighborhood so don't know how often I will be able to stop by, but if I am ever remotely close and need a little java, this is a great little spot.

Very, very hip, trendy place to hang out.  They have it all here. Great place for families and hipsters alike.  The shopping looks really cool with vintage clothing galore.  The PF Flyers were especially interesting.  Tried the famliy pack of Sliders, Brisket, Sausage, Meatball and Tuna. They also have Egg and Chicken I think.  Also tried the Apple Fritter desert.  Very good.  The night I went was the first night they tried music.  it seemed to go over well and the owner, Steve told me they plan to have more music acts in the coming months.   Since I mentioned Steve, the owner, Let's go ahead and mention the staff.  The second I walked into the place I was greeted by an employee.  Welcomed and given the nickel tour.  The Staff at the bar and the trailer-kitchen (More about that in a min) were very friendly.    The creative use of the space was so interesting. Its one of those places that the first time you are there you just sit and look around the space.  Vintage records hang from the wall, An authentic Hamm's Bear beer statue. Original Brick walls and exposed building trusses.   Now to the vintage Airstream travel trailer.  They use it as an outdoor kitchen. You order your food from a picnic table and they make it in the trailer/kitchen.  Very Cleaver.    For me, the best part was the vintage cocktails. I have been reading a lot about the trend to recreate old style cocktails that for one reason or another are not made anymore. Drinks like the old-fashion, the Cuba Libre, or Rusty Nail.  I could go on about the authentic soda fountain, the bakery and ice cream if I had more time. I will just say go to the Duce and see for yourself   One slight bummer is the prices.  Slightly expensive. $8 bucks for 3 sliders.  $10 for a desert that was pretty small.  Cocktails are all $10 and above. They seem to try to offer some inexpensive alternatives $3 for PBR's and Hamm's beer.  That may be a fun novelty but the reason those beers are nearly defunct is because they suck. I guess if you want to save some cash by chocking down some horrible beer, Knock  yourself out.  But if you want to get something decent, you need to be prepared to pay just a little more at the Duce.   All in all I highly recommend this place. Go check it out for yourself.  I know I am looking forward to my next visit.

I have been to Zaytoon twice and both times have been wonderful. The food is pretty typical persian food.  Kabobs, couscous, taboule and gyros. The hummus is very good and I always a side of Gyro meat with my Chicken Kabob. The ingredients are fresh and the service is good.

I have been curious about Spasso for a while now.  Went for lunch last week and had a very pleasant meal there.  They don't call themselves Pizza and Mozzarella bar for nothing.  There is Mozzarella available on almost every dish.  They have a typical Italian fare, Panini's, Pizza, meatball sandwiches. The salads looked very good as well.  Let me start with the best part, The staff and service.  It was very good. I sat at the bar and ordered a Pelligrino while I waited for my lunch companion to arrive. Apparently someone had failed to chill Pelligrino the night before and they only had warm bottles.  They served it to me in a glass with ice but were extremely apologetic about it. Hey, I know stuff happens, I was more impressed with their genuine and sincere disappointment in the situation. The staff was extremely pleasant, helpful and courteous during my visit.  The owner, Jim came by and introduced himself.  I love it when they do that.   The food was also very good.  We had a half pizza and Egg Plant sandwich. The Pizza we ordered included Prosciutto and it was excellent.  I love italian stlle pizza with a smoky and crisp crust.  This pizza was on par with Chris Bianco's pizza's. Maybe the cheese was just a little runny, but I am spitting hair's here.  The Egg Plant sub was also very good.   The wine list was small list was small but carefully chosen. You can find a large enough variety of wine too satisfy everyone in the group from what I saw by quickly glancing over the wine list.  They also carried a beer that up until last week I had never tried. The Drifter Lager from Widmer Brothers brewery in Portland. I have since found it in retail store and bought myself some. Thanks Spasso for turning my onto a few beverage.   All in all, it was a very nice afternoon. I wished I could have lingered a little while to enjoy some of the other offerings.  I guess I will have to go back soon to do that.

I have been wanting to go to Big Earl's since the day it opened.  I finally got my chance last night and I have to say that I was not disappointed.  They have a good selection of BBQ staples and even offer a cheeseburger for those to want to bail out on the southern food experience. I went with two other guys and we all ordered something different so I was able to try 3 things at once.  I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich and my friends got the Hot Link and BBQ Chicken.  My Pork Sandwich was tender and delicious.  The serving size was huge, really big.  I like BBQ places that offer a variety of BBQ Sauces, but I also dont want to have to choose between 10 different varities.  BBQ sauce should not be like a salsa bar.  But variety is good. I found the sweet sauce to be tangy and delicouns.  My friends sandwiches were equally well done.    But what I really want to talk about are the sides.  I had the most wonderful Cornbread and sweet Molasses sauce I have ever tasted. My friends had collard greens.  Now, my friend has never had collard greens and when he ordered it I asked him if he has ever had collard greens or know what they were. He had not.  But I was surprised when he got his order he promptly commence to devouring them.  I was impressed.   Also a quick word about the drinks.  They have a great selection of beer and whiskey. Their $3 Special "The Crow" is a small beer and shot of Old Crow Whiskey.  Two kinds, regular of their Cherry infused version.   I need to go back and try their happy hour because it looks like they have some really good deals.  I could go on and on about Big Earl's.  This review would get long and boring. Suffice to say, there are many many reasons why I will be returning very soon.

Just like the previous reviews I have no issue with the comedian. Ralphie May was hysterical and gave a hell of a show. He even tried to take responsibility for the fiasco that occurred last night at this show.  He ran late on his 1st show and the ticketed patrons waited outside for nearly an hour after the scheduled start of the 2nd show.  Ralphie tried to apologize and take responsibility for the delay and defend the wait staff at Stand Up Live.  An admirable gesture Ralphie but there is no excuse for the horrendous service at this club.   If Stand Up LIve staff knew that the 1st show ran over and they were cleaning the venue for the 2nd performance would it have been too difficult to send a staff member outside to inform the ticketed people waiting outside in 90 degree temps, even at 10pm.  Many people began approaching the ticketing window and asking for refunds.  Once inside the full out seating was uncomfortable and way to crowded.  I can't believe the fire marshall signed off on that many people in a room and only one main exit. Perhaps there are other emergency exits but because the restrooms are located in the lobby I had a constant stream of people walking in front of me for the entire 2 hours of the performance.  Because we were obligated to a two drink minimum we had to order something.  The service was terribly slow, the drinks extremely over priced and the food was terrible.  I am not even going to get into the acoustics of the room which were also very bad.

Finally made it to Pete's last night and found myself some very good Pad Thai.  The portions were huge and the food was fresh and delicious.  When the food is this good the service is not a great concern to me. However if the service is also good that is just added incentive.  The service was also very good.  Took maybe a tad long to get our food to the table but it was worth it.  Can't wait to go back and try a rice dish.

Great new coffee house in Arcadia.  Nice selection of offerings.  My Vanilla latte was delicious.  Thanks for offering low-fat products.  Saw some other patrons having some baked goods.  They looked appetizing. Service was great and the atmosphere was fun and inviting.  Can't wait to go back.

So here is the deal.  I have been to Oink twice before and although I liked it I was not blown away or anything.  I would say it was slightly above average.  But I also knew there was something special about this place.  So recently I went back for the third time and I discovered something great.   So for years now if anyone mentioned chicken fried steak there was only one place that came to mind.  Texaz Grill.  Everyone agrees that they have the best chicken friend steak in town.  Well I am here to tell you,  there is a new player in town.  Oink has amazing, amazing chicken fried steak.  I would have to say that Oink and Texaz Grill are 1 and 1A.  in no particular order.    Also maybe it was because I was enjoying my food so much that the service was also exceptional that day.    I am very much looking forward to my next visit to Oink.

I've driven by this place a thousand time. Finally tonight flipped a U-Turn and drove in.  From the rear parking lot I could see stacks of applewood that is used in their cooking. Good sign.  Once inside I sat at the bar and had some really good street tacos.  Hint:  When the Lamb tacos are recommended go with it. I ordered 2 chicken and 1 lamb.  Wished I would have switched that around.    They have a small but decent selection of craft beers.  The specialty drink menu looks good and I am looking forward to going back.   I sat at the bar and had excellent sever from Stacy.

Pizza is pretty good for a bar. The sandwiches are huge.  Inexpensive drinks and a fun crowd. Not too snobby and not to trashy. Just good people. Decent selection of craft beers.

I've been here a few time for breakfast and once for lunch.  Excellent every time.  But my new thing is I discovered their Ham and Cheese Croissants.  So now I have their phone number on my speed dial.  Call it it every morning and I am in and out in a few mins. Love this place.
