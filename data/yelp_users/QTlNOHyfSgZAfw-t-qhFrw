If I could give zero stars I would.. My husband and I had dined in 4 times. Each time we got the same thing but the total was always more then the last time we visited. We just thought the prices increased  and they didn't update the sign above until today.. Today I ordered my usual 2 bagels and "home" fries and they CHARGED ME 3 THOUSAND DOLLARS.. When the woman behind the counter told me my card was declined I quickly checked my account.. When I noticed the charge I was shocked and told her to reverse it.. Errors happen but it should have been 14$ and she charged 3,311.00$  she got irate wth me and said she didn't do the card wrong. I showed her my bank app with the proof and she told me to come back tomrrow to talk to the manager. I became so upset and told her she needed to get her manager down here now and have him fix it. That I wasn't leaving without the money refunded or reversed. She started arguing with me so I decided to call the police best to have them demand her manager.  I wasn't leaving seeing how the cater and I didn't need them lieing and saying I ordered 6,000 bagels or something. When the manger showed up she was even ruder. She (the manager) told me she reversed it and that j shouldn't have yelled at her employee. The cop standing behind me looked at her and said, lady if you took that much money from me I would have yelled too, she was in shock..  This is not how you handle business. If she doesn't know how to use the undo button on a credit card machine she shouldn't be left alone.. The charge was reversed but I will NEVER be coming back here.

Today I had the horrible expirence of  eating at Johnny Rockets. Courtney was our server and needs some serious training on how to interact with customers.. We ordered a child's grilled chicken meal for my son.. When it arrived it had fries instead of Applesauce and celery. Since I remember from the menu it was supposed to have celery sticks and applesauce I called Courtney over. I explained I rather him have the applesauce and celery and asked her if she could take the fries back. She said since I already had the fries she couldn't exchange them. I told her it was an error on her end since I wanted what the menu stated it came with.. She said okay pick celery or applesauce.. I showed her the menu and it said AND, she said well the menus wrong he only gets one plus kids eat free on Monday so it's not like I'm paying for his meal.. I was appalled. First off I had no idea kids are free I didn't mind paying for his meal but I want my 1 year old to have healthy option not French fries and since the menu said both I expected both... She took the fries away and just brought back applesauce not celery. After that she never came back to our table. My drink sat empty for 26 minutes until she brought the check she never refilled my drink.. I asked another waitress to fill by soda and told her my waitress apparently didn't want to fill mine... If this is the way Johnny rocket handles business I'll never be back...

First time in my whole 25 years of living that my legs aren't feeling like I'm  being electrocuted i want to say Thank you to my massage therapist Toni you are a great healer! You made me feel what "living" to normal people feels like

Went into Verizon today to purchase 2 lines of service and two IPhone 6 plus'.. Walking in you could see the place was pretty packed... Rodney greeted us asked our name and told us the expected wait time.. He was super friendly with my husband , myself and my one year old.. While we waited we asked if they had the phones in stock we wanted.. We were happy to find out they had the 128 gigs available.. About 20 minutes went by and we were greeted by Lea W. She was super happy to be at work., you can just tell by her demeanor that Verizon is a great place to be at.. She answered about a zillion questions from us all while smiling. She gave her personal experience and never seemed pushy or in a rush... The whole process took about an hour. Most of that was error on my husband and myself end.. We didn't have account information on hand from our two current providers... The reason we decided to go with Verizon is because my husband and I have no service with AT&T in our home.. I had friends and family come over with Verizon and they had full or nearly full bars... While husband was searching for information from our old places Lea sparked up server all conversations with me and my baby. She is just the sweetest caring person we've met in a really long time. Lea was super professional while also making us feel like we've been friends for a long time.. This is very important when you are making a huge purchase. Switching over to Verizon was flawless.. And we have Lea to thank.. So thank you Lea for going above and beyond!!! IDad, Imom and ibaby

Tonight my family and I went to Dine in at Hayashi... When we walked in we were greeted by Shawn... He greeted us with a huge smile and was super friendly.. Shawn has definitely been a server or should be one here because he brings a huge positive vibe and makes the atmosphere at Hayashi. Our server was Ned fast and efficient.. We ordered 3 different types of sushi ( the spicey tuna roll which was amazing, Lv rolls and a California roll for the baby) and beef fried rice... Since it was happy hour I ordered a Long Island iced tea.. It was super strong so I had my husband drink it. He said it was a little strong but he enjoyed it.. We had a great time and we're happy to have a great sushi place so close to home..  If you looking for great sushi definitely give this place a try!

To whom it may concern. Today my family and I visited your lake pleasant and Happy Valley Location. I'm sad to have to be reporting that our dining experience was far below satisfactory. Let me begin by telling you the manner in which your "Lead Brooke B" presented herself in front of paying customers has left us with a sour feeling  in our stomachs and heavy hearts for the other 2 employees Sam and Jenn for having to report to such a person.  Our experience began after ordering we observed  Brooke tell Jenn (while Jenn was cutting paper we're assuming for trays) that she should pretend she was getting payed while at work and go actually work. You could see on Jenn's face she was mortified and holding back the tears. I went and grabbed the manager on duty and I apologize I didn't get his name. I told him what I heard and he said Brooke's just having a bad day and apologized on her behalf.. Okay being the understanding person that I am I get being in a serving  industry you have good an bad days, just like any one we human. But to my dismay Brooke's lack of professionalism didn't end there.  Brooke had asked Sam to hurry it up with the shakes that making shakes wasn't rocket science. Moments later Brooke asked Jenn to go outside to clean the tables. Jenn cleaned 2 but one family was still eating. I witnessed her taking the food they were done with and went back to the register as the line was getting pretty backed up...  When Brooke noticed the out side dining area was still dirty, Brooke grabbed the manager and said I can't believe her (Jenn) if I could I swear I'd smack the shit out of her..  Then walked to Jenn and pulled her mid sentence helping a customer and let's go outside and chat about what I mean when I ask for something to be done. At the very second I couldn't take it I stopped her and said. You are ruining our dining expirence. How dare you talk to your colleges like this.. Brooke started laughing and asked if I was serious.. I replied this is no laughing matter and you should stop smiling immediately. As a business owner my self I am appalled that she thinks this is funny. I told her my family  are paying customers and have the right to enjoy our meal but instead I have been taking notes on her behavior. She said she was sorry but that's how she is she was just kidding with them and everyone likes it or leaves it. I told her she should be apologizing to Sam and Jenn for acting that way and the rest of the diner for literally ruining all our meals. at this time an older couple behind us started clapping an thanked us for standing up for in there words those 2 poor girls.. I told Brooke that once we left I  will be contacting the franchise owner. She grabbed her badge and said here is my name and its a corporation not a franchise. My family and I left utterly disgusted.  The attitude and complete lack of respect for her colleges makes me sick to my stomach. We will never be returning to any other smash burger and negativity travels fast. One oh shit moment erases a life time of compliments. I will be sharing my story with anyone who will listen including social media, yelp and the BBB.  For the sake of those 2 wonderful employees sake I hope this message is heard and that Brooke is reprimanded accordingly.  Please feel free to reach me by email at Mrsbrittanytafoya@gmail   Thank you for you time,  Brittany Tafoya CEO and Owner of ATR Preschool

We went to got que today and will not be returning.. First we told Ricky the server that we had need been there before and we asked for a sample.. He looked at me like I had 3 eyes. So said I'd like to try the brisket and pork and see which I like better. He rudely stated the brisket tastes like brisket the pork tastes like pork. I found this extremely rude. If they don't do samples that's all he had to say. Anyways we got the family package of pork.. It wasn't anything that you couldn't do in a crockpot..  The coleslaw we got was HORRIBLE.. Something was defiantly missing... And the meal was served with Sara Lee hamburger buns.. Aweful customer service and food was nothing spectacular.. If your looking for great BBQ make the drive to Rudy's
