Always accommodating! Always ready with a smile! My clothes always come back in perfect condition. The service is worth the price and by far the best in scottsdale!

Kept waiting for over an hour and a half (including an hour after supposed check in time). There went my day at the pool! went to eat at the lobby bar and the hostess was too busy texting in the back to seat guests. There are much more hospitable hotels on the strip.  Also now that I am FINALLY in my room, I have a view of the seriously sketchy side of Vegas.

The cakes are delicious but the past TWO times I've been there they help customers that walk in after me before they take my order.... Frustrating! Causing wait times around 40 minutes. GREAT cakes but better customer service is needed.

This is the most AMAZING sushi place i have ever been to. Its not fancy or high end, but the prices are great, the food is terrific, but by far my favorite part is the outstanding service. The Miso Soup and salad with ginger dressing that come with every meal are delicious! And I could eat their crunch rolls all day long!  love love love
