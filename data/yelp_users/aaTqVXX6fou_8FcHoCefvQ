Terrible customer service. We called to make a reservation for a large party. No problems making the reservation, were told they could accommodate no problem. When we arrived they put us at two tables. We asked to be seated at one table and were told that they "can't accommodate large parties". No one told us over the phone that we'd be separated when we made the reservation. We asked why we couldn't be seated at one long table when the dining room was currently empty and was told that "all the empty tables were reserved". This was a lie. We sat at two separate tables for two hours and many of the tables around us remained empty our entire meal. We even saw a large party of 11 people seated together (we had 14). The manager never came over to speak to us, nor to apologize. The food was cold. The hostess was short and dismissive. I was a long-time fan of this place, but you can bet that none of us will ever return and we have told everyone we know about our terrible experience. It's disappointing that an establishment like this would be so rude to local customers and flat out lie to our face. Don't go here if you have a large party or dislike liars.

My favorite place! I never have a problem making an appointment, always friendly, smells great inside and is conveniently located - what else could you want?

I love this place! Have been here four times now and am always happy. Never orange, easy to make an appointment and they do happy hour pricing from 12-4pm weekly! Doesn't get much better, except Laura is always nice, talkative and checks in on your past tan after each appointment.

Coffee ice cream didn't taste like coffee. Bland and no flavor. Seemed like a long prep process for just one flavor and one topping. I didn't see any difference from any other the other nearby ice cream/yogurt shops.

Best nail salon ever! I have been going to the Tempe location for three years and recently moved to North Scottsdale. So happy to have Jeniza nearby! Longest lasting mani/pedi with the best customer service!!
