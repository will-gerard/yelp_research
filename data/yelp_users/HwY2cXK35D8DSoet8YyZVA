When I walked in I got no welcome, the guy had an attitude and was acting like he is doing me a favor.. I just walked out and said to him to change the way you treat customers.. Horrible!

The staff is wonderful, always trying to help you find something.. Better to be bothered with an offer to help than be ignored! Great service.

By far the worst customer service ever!! I came in and this one guy was just rude and very unhelpful, I asked if he can install a windshield wiper for me and he said no take it to your mechanic, I didn't argue about it so I just said okay and left... But I will never be back there ever again!! It's not about him not helping me it's just the way it was handled, it could've been a little more nicer.

Everytime I come In this place I get greeted by the same people, that's a nice thing and means the workers are friendly And love their job, the food is always great and never had a bad experience.. You must try the Yaki soba bowl, it is my favorite!!

This is the only Starbucks that treats their customers with a great attitude and great smiles, I got a grande white mocha frap and it was super fast and friendly, I enjoy the drive thru, when I get a break at work and want something cold, this is where I come to..good job guys!!

I love the chicken gyro, always busy and the food is always the same always fresh and made to order, One downside is that they charge for every little sauce but other than that it's great

Wow isn't the word, so I recently got recommended this restaurant and came to check it out with the wife and I must say the food was awesome! But the waiter was horribly rude and had no personality at all!!! This put a bad taste to our opinion. We will try to come back another time and will definitely ask for a different waiter..   Who knows maybe he was having a bad day, even though it's a people and customer service business I still believe you should be 100% with every table!

Hit or miss car wash, most of the time they forget to wipe down a window or the car isn't dry enough.. Always something.. Needs a lot more training to wash cars

Love the donuts! Every time I walk in I have to wait for somebody to take care of me even though there's nobody waiting but the problem is they have only one or two employees and they take care of the drive-through first.. I would give it five stars but the service wasn't all there

This place is great, always a fresh sandwich.. Must try number 13, you will love it! The employees always greet you and make sure you get what you want! It sucks that they don't toast but it is still good with the toppings, I get it "mikes way"

The worst Dunkin donuts ever, went in there the other day and ordered a coffee and a bagel with cream cheese and waited like 35 minutes.. I finally got really upset and asked for a refund and left hungry.. The lady said "your order was never processed "  I was like ..  What???  I'm a paying customer just like everyone else!!  I will never go back there!!

Was in the neighborhood and came across this place which seemed kind of a good idea but after we ordered the food it was anHorrible experience with the service and the food isn't fresh at all.. The teriyaki chicken dish was like rubber and didn't seem like chicken at all.. We are never coming here again!

Absolutely love the "New Yorker" it's always the same every time you order it.. The staff has been with the company for many many years and that's good to see in the food industry.. New locations is awesome and clean.. Defiantly recommend this place
