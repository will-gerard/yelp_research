love the yucca! Great selection of beers and music. the new lounge part is great and the bartenders are helpful when trying to choose from the large selection of beers! Great place.

What a great place especially if you like great pizza and beer. I got the mushroom pizza and paired it with the Short Hop Session IPA from Four Peaks. The decor is great there too. They used reclaimed wood all over the bar area. A really nice touch. Brian was my bartender and took great care of me. Check this place out.

What a great place!  Awesome beer selection, food and atmosphere. Downtown Phoenix has a much needed gem of a draft house. I will be back as much as i can.

Pretty crappy experience with this visit. The assistant manager with the bad attitude and hickies all over his neck started it off and the overcooked burger finished it off. Not sure what happened but this place has gone down hill fast. Won't be coming back here.

This place has it all. Great food, atmosphere, beer and service. Our server/ bartender Erika was great. Sat at a table with a buddy and my 1 year old son and she was awesome. Will be back soon! Thanks Vig!
