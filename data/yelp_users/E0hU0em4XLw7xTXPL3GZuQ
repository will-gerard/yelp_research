I have a rental home in Chandler and needed to get a light fixture fixed because my tenants had just moved in and found an issue with one of the fixtures.  Dodge electric was very accommodating and took the initiative to ask for the tenant contact information and made the appointment themselves within a few days!  All in all, the customer service and work performed were high quality.  Thanks and we now have an electric go-to company! :)

Great little restaurant for lunch or breakfast!  The Florentine salad was amazing and my don loved his veggie sandwich.

This place is fantastic!  The outdoors is surrounded by mature and eye catching trees and the garden used to supply the restaurant with fresh and organic veggies. :). The food was great, simple breakfast menu items but made wonderfully!  We will return.

This company was recommended to me by Spencer's Appliance, who I regularly use to purchase appliances, so I thought this would be a good choice in service to mount my flat screen TV. I was devastatingly wrong. Where do I start.... First, I made an appointment for a Saturday since this is the only day I am home to meet the technicians. I arranged my day so that I was home from noon to 6pm because I wanted to ensure I was home. Well, I did not receive a call or nobody showed up. This is very unprofessional, I would've appreciated a call to at least let me know they would not be showing up. The next day I received a call to inquire about my installation. Apparently, they still had my paperwork and it wasn't filed. The man who called me let me know that a new guy was on the job Saturday and they were incredibly busy...this is no excuse. He apologized profusely and I agreed to reschedule for the following Saturday. Since I purchased a dynamic mount, I made sure to let the owner know and I also let him know that I'd need a power outlet installed behind the TV because I didn't want wires weaving out and around the wall mounted TV. He acknowledged the mount was ok to mount and that his crew could easily install the wall outlet. I want to iterate that I reminded this company TWICE about this request. Then, the next Saturday rolled around. The two technicians were clearly overwhelmed with the mount and they said this was much more complicated than they were used to. They also said they were not certified for installing electrical sockets and/or tearing dry wall. Please note I made this clear during scheduling of both appointments. They left that Saturday letting me know that the drywall/electrical crew and install crew were both scheduled... for yet, the following Saturday.. this is the final attempt at giving this company a chance in my book. So the third Saturday comes around, and I get no morning call to give me a confirmation they were coming. So... I called the company several times trying to confirm my appointment. The install crew answered and let me know that the owner, Dave, was responsible for jobs that entailed my type of detail and he was not answering his phone. After multiple attempts of the crew trying to contact Dave (the owner) and the office to help contact Dave, no luck. And to top it all off, nobody showed up, again. At this point I feel totally defeated and let down by this company. I gave them every chance to redeem their short-comings and they kept showing their true unprofessional colors. I would highly recommend to STAY AWAY from this company unless you want a very frustrating and disappointing experience...

After my experience with Bulwark moving, I would not recommend them to anyone!  First of all my move was a very straight forward and small move from a 5X10 storage unit to my home.  I never used this moving company but thought I would give them a try since they had a Living Social offer that ended up saving me some money.  The biggest lesson I got was that a cheap job ends being more costly in the long term!!  Two of the items I had included a washer/dryer and my treadmill.  After telling the moving crew to take it apart because I had  trouble moving them before, they decided they would take it upstairs without measuring the space in the upstairs area which lead to the room it was to be put in.  Needless to say, it took them almost two hours to get the treadmill upstairs!  Guess what they ended up doing, YES, they ended up having to take it apart after all!  If they would've just taken my advice it would've taken a fraction of the time!  Plus my stairs got all scraped and gouged because they were having such a hard time getting the treadmill upstairs.   Off to my next experience...  the washer...  Since one of the movers didn't turn off the water values in my laundry room, there was a pretty good size water leak caused by this negligence.  In addition, the pipe connected to my washer was also incorrectly connected which caused leaking from the back of the washer.  Another note, because it was in storage it had it had the shipping pins in order to protect the drum during transit.  After installation at my home, the washer was shaking all over the laundry room and it was leaking.  After another $130 spent having a tech come out to fix it, they found that the movers never removed the shipping pins despite the large warning sign next to the shipping pin that had red font and read "REMOVE SHIPPING PINS PRIOR TO INSTALLATION".    The best part comes when I called to let the owner know about these issues, and the response I got was that it's not their responsibility to remove the shipping pins or with anything that involves installation of my appliances.  Also, my paperwork said they would contact me two business days after my move to repair my flooring.  It's already a week later and I still haven't received a call and was told the guy responsible for repairs would be back next week.  After this very bad experience, I wouldn't recommend this company as they are very unprofessional , caused damage to my home, and their inexperience clearly shows with the negligence in moving appliances.

From the time we arrived and throughout breakfast, it was a very bad experience. My omelette was drenched and dripping of oil and our waitress was not knowledgable of the menu. I will not be returning.

The Sandi sandwich was very tasty, next time I'll skip the aioli though. I opted for the roasted turkey as my protein and asked for raw jalape√±os on the side, great way to give it a kick! My son had the Lil Lumberjack and it was a good sized portion. His apple carrot juice was delicious and my coffee was awesome as well. I'll definitely be back.  Oh, one last thing, the peanut butter gluten free cookie was amazzzzing! Eaten with a hot cup of coffee, is heaven! :D
