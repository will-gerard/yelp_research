I will NOT go back to this Denny's. Me and some friends walk in and get seated last Saturday night. We waited about 10min for a server to approach us. It was late so we wasn't rushing them or anything. It was probably 2:30 to 3:00am. The waiter finally comes over...doesn't say hello. Goes straight into our drink orders. We place our drink orders and once he's done I ask the other 3 in my party if they are ready to place their food orders as well...they said yes. So, I asked the waiter if we can place our food order now as well...he turns his head side ways and says NO and stares me down...I said really why not...he says because he has other tables and I say it would be easier to do it all now then...he said NO AND YOUR GETTING ANOTHER WAITER...snaps his neck and walks off....Where is this acceptable behavior at? I am calling into speak to the Manager. Oh yes, I asked for a Manager on the way out because of course we didn't stay to eat there and the lady up front said there was no Manager in at the moment. Really, out of all my years as a waitress I have never known an establishment to not have a Manager on site all the time. I know its Denny's and I know it was late but come on we gotta do better then this disrespect. If you hate your job get a new one.

I was disappointed by the lack of customer service at Lo Los.  Me and a friend waited like 15 minutes to be seated which wasn't bad. 10 minutes after being seated we were told by the waitress that she would be right with us. 5 minutes later she comes to take our drink order. 10 minutes later we order our food. 10-15 minutes after the waitress comes to say there are no greens which totally messed up the whole meal. We ask for the manager. Carlos comes over and says it would be 15 minutes for greens and there won't be a problem.  Carlos then comes right back and says it will be an hour for greens. No apology no type of compensation for the huge issue. So we suggest a complimentary margarita in the meantime and Carlos looks at us crazy and says "on the house" like it was an unimaginable request.  After he dismisses the suggestion he  tries to sweet talk us into string beans. We agree. 25 minutes later we notice two tables seated AFTER us and one has greens. We then call Carlos over and tell him what we have recognized and he argues with us saying we haven't been there an hour because the waitress put the order in 25 minutes ago and it was placed after the two tables that arrived after us. Needless to say they lost two customers today.

Where do I begin...I guess I will start by saying that Sandbar Desert Ridge has lost a customer and the 12 people that came to celebrate my Birthday. I reserved a table for Super Bowl Sunday which was my Birthday on 02/01/15. My first issue was walking up to the door of Sandbar and the lady saying that there was a $5 cover charge. I tell her that I have a reserved table and wasn't told that I have to have a $300 minimum on top of a $5 PER PERSON cover charge. She says we just decided to charge a cover charge BUT it will be deducted from your tab. I say ok since it will be deducted. (Issue #1)  When I called and talked to Justin the "VIP Host" over a week prior to my Birthday he asked me how many people am I expecting...I said probably 8-10 and he said ok. He never mentioned the amount of chairs allotted per table. I get there as planned at 2pm on Sunday and the table is all the way in the corner in the back. Barely no one was at the other reserved tables yet so I ask to move tables. I guess the waitress felt like she needed Justin "The VIP Host" and he comes over and doesn't say hello or nothing just goes into NO YOU CANT MOVE TABLES and I told you over the phone that the tables seat 6. I said No, you didn't and he proceeds to say yes he did. (Issue #2) So, I notice my attitude turning the wrong direction on my birthday so I decide to let it go. Also, had we left he would have still charged me for the $300 minimum on my credit card. I was pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place. So, I let it go and proceed to enjoy my Birthday. The staff was super slow. Justin the "VIP Host" was super rude. Oh yea, so as I am leaving to my car the waitress runs me down talking about I have a tab for $50 and we didn't meet the $300 minimum. Now, between 12 people everyone's tab was well over $55 EACH how did we NOT hit the minimum? Plus, my guests bought my drinks so how did I have a $50 tab? Oh yea, the waitress once again ran and got Justin when she chased me outside and brought him to my car because I told her once again that the lady at the door said that all of the cover charges would b deducted from the tab. Justin told me that I wasn't told that and he is not talking to me anymore and turned his back to me. (Issue #3) My friend just ended up paying for it but I will be calling today to talk to a Manager about all the discrepancies.  I have never been treated so horrible by a restaurant that should be catering to its customers. From the moment we walked in I was in a bad mood by the unprofessionalism of the staff at Sandbar Desert Ridge.

I placed my order online. Got home and my burrito was made wrong. I called back to let them know and they said just come back in. I informed her that I need my steak well done. It was not done well done by the time I got there so I had to wait ten minutes. As soon as I walked up I asked to speak to the manager...the girl at the front desk says she already told Management what had happened. So, I asked for the Manager again. The Manager finally comes out and I express to them that if I ask for a Manager I should be given a Manager. I also expressed my poor experience and how customers should be acknowledged by Management if there is a problem. This particular Manager didn't care so I asked for a refund and I will not be going back to Chipotle (ANY location) until customer service practices have improved.

I just had to write in to express my thanks to the Manager Edmanda. I went in yesterday and the service from the waitress was not a good one. She totally forgot about us and it was just 2 people at my table. While waiting on condiments our food had gotten cold since we waited 15 minutes. So, the Manager smoothed things over by making us brand new meals to go and giving us free entr√©e vouchers for next time. My friend that was with me didn't request her dinner be re-made but the Manager showed up with a complete dinner anyway. She figured it was my friends first time dining at TR that she couldn't let her leave unhappy. I must say normally service is great and I will be returning. Just an off night for the waitress I suppose. Thanks to management for saving the day.

Our visit to Massage Envy at Desert Ridge was awesome! I am a member from the Moon Valley location but was referred to Desert Ridge due to them having a Couples massage room. The front desk staff was awesome. They even assisted in me getting my credit card issues resolved. Somehow, my credit card was unable to be saved in the system so I would have to walk in to make my payment monthly. The team at Moon Valley hadn't thought to put in a ticket for this error and the staff at Desert Ridge suggested they do so. My boyfriend and I got a couples massage from Andrew and Lorrie and both were amazing. We will be back to see these two. Thanks a lot.

Yummy! Loved the Snow Crab.  If you like spicy definitely go a notch UNDER your regular spice level. I normally do hot but the medium was hot for me. Definitely going back. My friends loved the boiled shrimp too.

Everyone who knows me knows that I LOVE hot n juicy on Mill Ave. I go pretty often and yesterday I went and this time it was a less than pleasurable experience. Me and my friend went around 1230 so it was pretty early. We both ordered Crab; I ordered Snow and she ordered King. So, we get our food and ask for crab crackers and the waitress says they ran out of crab crackers at a seafood place. Every time I go they are ALWAYS low on crab crackers but this time took the cake because they didn't have any. Had we known before we ordered we would have ordered something other than crab. I ended up using my teeth to crack the crab, the waitress offered her help and brought a drinking glass to help us. Can you imagine being in a restaurant and the waitress is banging your crab with a drinking glass? lol, it was a mess. The District Manager was in on this day and i'm not sure if she's new or maybe she needs training but she wasn't helpful at all. She came to our table 3 times the first time very apologetic and saying that she'd discount the bill, the bill was discounted for $2.67. The waitress came to take the bill and I expressed how $2.67 was an insult and they should think about customer retention because this visit was horrible. The GM comes back with 20% off each crab order totally like $9 bucks off. We still wasn't happy so the waitress comes back for the tab and asked was that better and I honestly answered not at all. The GM comes back again with an attitude and asks what she can do to make things right so I answer 50% off the bill considering this was the worst experience. She fixed the bill and assured us this would be fixed. Next time i'm hoping it will be fixed. Also, I have a background in the restaurant business so I know how management compensates for less than pleasurable experiences. Had the GM sufficiently discounted the bill the first time things would have gone a lot smoother on a Sunday afternoon.

Myself and my co-workers placed two online orders for pick-up today. We get back to work after picking the order up and half the order is missing. We go back to let them know and the Manager has an attitude about it. The Male Manager (didn't get his name) shouted at me and my Manager and said it was no ones fault about the mishap. Don't do online orders if you cant make sure that its accurate. The Manager was not apologetic at all. Didn't offer any coupons, a credit or anything. Keep in mind that we had to make two trips to get a correct order. I feel like the customer service is lacking. They in no way insured that I would e a continuous customer and they have lost our business.
