Sadly I do not have a good review.    Like most relationships it started out really good...I had taken my cat to Maricopa Wells when I moved to the 'copa and they were attentive and kind....  More recently (Nov 14 to be exact) I took my dog who has recurrent seizures and had her blood work done, and this visit was great, no complaints. They didn't find any specific reason as to why she was having seizures and the Dr advised me that if she has another one to contact the office and they will fill a prescription for an anti seizure medication....here's where it starts to go down the pooper...Right on schedule, my lovely Bella had a seizure 3 weeks later. I called the office and was told that there was no record of a prescription and that (according to the notes) there wasn't anything in the blood-work indicating a need for a prescription, but she would put a note in the file and have the Dr. respond and would call me back. Life happens I didn't get a follow up,....a month later, she had another seizure, I called the office, same conversation ensued...no call back. A month later she had another seizure, I called the office SAME conversation....Seeing a pattern here??  Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I called the office AGAIN, same conversation. I asked 'why aren't there notes of these conversations', sensing my frustrating, she said I will send it over to the Dr and call you back TODAY.  Two days pass, I call the office again..."It looks like the Dr started to enter the notes and didn't finish..." I will have her finish and call you back TODAY." Two more days pass, I call the office again...."oh it looks like here she needs to know if shes had a seizure since her visit in November" ...Naturally, I'm over this (and worried about my baby, since her seizures are getting worse) and remind her sternly 'Yes she had a seizure on this date in December when I called, and in January when I called and in February when I called and in March when I called....why isn't this information in the notes and why didn't you call me if you had questions AFTER promising me a return call same day?!?!' She responded, "I will talk to the Dr and call you back TODAY" 2 more days pass, and she calls and says "we need to get Bella's weight for the dosage, can you bring her in?"   At this point....I feel like she's giving me medication because I asked for it and I keep calling...  I UNDERSTAND, you work at a Vet clinic and you see hundreds of animals a week and I UNDERSTAND that EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER thinks they are the most important and their animals are their babies and every situation is urgent! (At least I do...)   If you don't want to treat customers with honesty and respect that their *babies* health are as important to you as they are to them, you need to find a new industry to work in.  Currently I am fighting them to get MY records so I can go to another highly recommended vet and not have to pay $300+ for the same blood work.... Evidently the Dr has to sign off permission to allow the Office to send me MY PET's records. And there isn't a timeline on when that can be done..."It might take 2 weeks..."  Since I don't like to be unhappy, or complain....seriously. Here's the good, if you are just going for a routine visit that doesn't require any follow up, you will probably be satisfied. They are friendly enough and personable and the Vet I saw *seems* knowledgeable.

So much fun and safety first!!  Who would have thought learning to ride.. safely... could be so much fun. After a loooooooong break from riding a motorcycle, I decided I wanted to get back on. I found Team Arizona's intro to riding course browsing the interwebs. The intro class was short and sweet.  John (our instructor) knew the subject incredibly well and learned me everything I need to know about being safe and not popping the clutch. I appreciated all the time we got to spend on the bike on the course getting introduced to the basics, because getting started and moving is the hardest part.  I plan on returning for the Basic Rider Course (and likely any additional courses they offer) to get some more experience under my seat before I brave the wild streets of Arizona drivers...  The instructors, are fun, funny and have awesome experiences to share.  I highly recommend this school and any of their courses for newbies and experts alike, you can never learn to much about riding fast, and safe!!

Decor was upgraded. Food was upgraded. Now they just need to update the service. I don't know why I keep going back because the service is frustratingly inattentive and disinterested, unless you're a regular. I don't think I am going to torture myself any longer thinking things will get better.  So my review, if you only care about food, its pretty decent when you finally receive it. And don't go if you're in a hurry ;-)

I tend to forget to write a review whenever I have a good experience...better late than never I suppose.   I am now a regular at Flair Salons. I was referred by a good friend and I am glad I went. My regular stylist moved far away from me and I was a little nervous about finding a new one, but I went to see Jessica at Flair! and I couldn't be happier. Her prices are affordable and she does a phenomenal job, cuts it exactly how I want it and doesn't grimace while I am trying to articulate exactly what I want. She is also really kind and fun to talk to which makes the time fly.  The salon is gorgeous and spacious and every person I have come in contact with is extremely friendly and not pushy about their services, or products. I am looking forward to trying out the nail service and will continue to be a customer as long as they'll have me.
