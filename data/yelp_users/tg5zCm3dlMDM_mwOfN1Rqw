I know I am in the minority on this one, but I was unimpressed with the food.  Went there for a Sunday lunch and had one of the signature dishes, the Liberty Bowl, which I found lacking imagination.  Kids had pizza, which was of insufficient quantity to satisfy even their small appetites.  This visit was back in November.  Will I try it again?  Probably, since I am a big fan of Joe's other establishments (Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favoritest restaurants of all time).

Having visited this restaurant on numerous occasions, I knew I needed to write an updated review.  The double Cortadito is a favorite when I am in the mood for coffee.  Breakfast is exceptional and the "Best Chicken Sandwich" is entirely aptly named, so much so that I rarely order other items, though I have on occasion enough to know that everything here is good.

I have lived in the area way too long to not have ever been to this restaurant.  Met up with friends for Saturday dinner to rectify that.  Adovada tamales were, of course, spicy but also quite flavorful.  Some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had and I can verify that the Kick-Ass Margarita is aptly named.  Great food, great service, great experience.

Wish I could say I had a good experience here, this past weekend, but alas I cannot.  This was the 4th bike I had purchased here in the last 2 and a half years, the other three times it was a decent experience (2 for my kids, mine last year at this time and now one to replace my girlfriend's bike that had been stolen from our garage).  This time, we came in on a Thursday evening looking for a particular brand and model. No problem, they had it, just not in the size we needed.  The guy that was there was very helpful (but, unfortunately leaving for vacation in 30 minutes) and said he would leave a note to have the size we were looking for built out the next morning so we could come by and try it out later that day.  By mid-day, we had heard nothing, so I called to find out when it would be ready.  Got a long winded story about how the he was all by himself and hadn't gotten to it yet, but he would build it out as his next task.  I said OK  and that we would be by in a few hours to give it a ride, which he indicated would be fine.  2 hours later, he still had not started it and tried to claim he knew nothing about it (now in person, rather than on the phone) until it was pointed out that the staff the previous day had left a note that was clearly visible at the counter. After acknowledging that, it was indicated that it probably wouldn't be ready until Saturday.  Came by at around 4:30pm on Saturday to finally give the desired bike a test ride.  That part went well, and we proceeded to complete the transaction, purchasing one additional item since he offered us 10% off any accessories.  I pointed out that they still needed to add the reflectors and the water bottle holder (which was clearly visible on the size small bike of the same model).  He said that the water bottle holder didn't come with the bike, only the piece that held it to the handlebars.  Once again, I referred to the size small bike (we were buying a size medium) that was 5 feet away and pointed out that we were of the opinion that it should be included. He was having none of it and this after he'd given us the runaround on the build-out.  To top it off, they overcharged me for the under-seat bag and when I went back in to get that corrected, it was a huge deal and wasn't even done right (2 bucks, even after the 10% discount  should have been $1.80 + tax back to me, somehow their cashiering system made that $1.85).  Guess I'll have to start looking around for a new bike shop.

I had been wanting to try this place for some time.  Got a coupon, so the wife and I had lunch there today.  I had a half sandwich (The Englishman) and soup (Loaded Baked Potato) and she had a half sandwich (The Southside) and soup (Broccoli Cheese).  Great tasting all around, but I was unimpressed with the quantity of meat on the sandwiches. I would go middle of the road and give two and half stars, but I just won't go to three, so I rounded down.

The kids and I were headed to the Mesa Arts Center for Ignite Phoenix 6, so we scoped around for a highly rated restaurant that was nearby.  So glad we decided on this place, the pizza was fantastic!  We will definitely be back.

Fan-tas-tic! Started with chicken satay and then pineapple fried rice since so many reviews mentioned it and tiger prawns prik king - flavors were out of this world - great customer service too

Making a dish somewhat spicy should take more than just tossing pepper flakes onto it - both the pineapple fried rice and pad Thai turned crunchy in the process. Unimpressed. And what is with the TV? Was playing some celebrity plastic surgery disasters show.

Five star food, five star people runnin' the place.  A big plus that it is so close to home (though we had no idea they were there until we saw them on Yelp! and recalled that they were an Ignite Food vendor).  Have been back numerous times and kept meaning to write them this here glowing review, which is richly deserved.

Not busy at all for St Patrick's Day ;)  Second time having Thai food within the week and this was by far the better of the two.  The only slight disappointment was the appetizer, Miang Kum.  When a dish states prawns as the second ingredient, I guess I expect a plump juicy prawn, not diced little bits of it.  Ah well, chock that up to unfamiliarity - will order Chicken Sa-Te next time!  The entrees we ordered, Pad Thai Shrimp and Pra Rham Chicken were excellent, the chili lime sauce on the latter was spicy and flavorful.

Is there a better place in Chandler to grab a craft beer and some tasty pub grub?  If you say yes, we may have to arm wrestle to determine who is right (hint, it's me). Chef Gidi's daily specials are sure to please a discerning pallet and the beers flow voluminously here.  Tuesday's are Team Trivia at 7pm - yet another reason to drink on a weekday (as if I needed a reason)

Found this place via Yelp! so I had to add my accolades to keep this train rolling.  My chili cheeseburger started out as a ball of meat on the grill - no frozen or pre-formed patties here!  The homemade chili is just the right amount of spicy.  I will definitely be back to try other menu items (like the Chicago dog).  Finding this place in the shopping plaza is not the easiest task, but perseverance will pay off - I know y'all are up to it.

Would not use them again. WTF, the dude was spraying something into the air in the living room. He says it smells good, I told him to stick to cleaning the carpet. They did a half-assed job on the stairs and left them very wet. Too much residue throughout.

The potstickers here are a-mazing! Noodles are fantastic. Fried rice was nothing special, but still flavorful.

Ended up here when other nearby places had a long wait and we were quite hungry. Should have taken into account that there was nobody eating in this place. Food was just kind of blah and the service was lacking both inspiration and perspiration.

Wow wowee wow wow!!! Five star all the way - the Strawberry Banana Bliss is appropriately named.  Have been back several times since this is now my favorite frozen confection establishment. Super nice and personable folks running the place.

This place is like a half mile from our house and we finally got around to trying it.  Impressive menu and the place is bigger than it looks from the road. Chicken fried steak and eggs were great and the service was friendly and very attentive. Definitely will be returning.

I came here this morning to pick up a pre-order (this will be my second time tasting the glorious delicacies, the first time I stood in line for 2 hours and It. Was. Totally. Worth. It). With an out of town guest, it was a no brainer to order a pickup to enjoy for dinner at home - the ordering process couldn't have been easier (way easier than deciding what to get) and the early pickup was efficient and enjoyable - heck I even tipped, I was so impressed with it. Now I can't wait to have the meaty goodness.  If you haven't been, you owe it to yourself and those you care about to make the pilgrimage - a religious experience awaits.

How is this place not busier? Great varied menu and daily & happy hour specials - definitely coming back!  Started with a pretzel appetizer - so soft and buttery.   I had the pasta bolognese which was a generous portion - took half home for tomorrow's lunch.

Came out during the soft launch - food was top notch - nice to see all local beers featured on tap (just a few for now, soon to be 36).  The back patio was great for a relaxing early dinner - the staff was friendly and attentive.  Will definitely return (already picked out the next pizza I want to order, even).

We eagerly awaited the arrival of this new location. Great beer selection (and they are on TapHunter to boot).  Had the meatball trio appetizer and a loaded potato pizza - the food arrived in a timely manner and was quite tasty.   Will definitely be back to try additional menu items.
