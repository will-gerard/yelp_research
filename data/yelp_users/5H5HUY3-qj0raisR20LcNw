I go to this location often (2-4 per week). The staff is always friendly and my order is accurate. The line usually isn't to bad but I've noticed Monday mornings seem to be pretty long for drive thru. So avoid on Monday AM and you should have fast service.

I have been visiting this restaurant since they opened and haven't written a review because every time we come it's a different experience. On our visit today for lunch the one major change I noticed is the prices went up. More than what I think is fair.   We visited during the lunch hour and almost every thing was $12-$16. Most salads don't have a protein and the salad that I ordered had so little chicken it should be considered bacon bits. We also had Mac and Cheese $12 again for nothing memorable. Noodles and Cheese. Service was slow... I usually hope to have my food within 15-20 minutes for lunch service but it seemed to push the later end of the time frame.   We love the patio and the view of Camelback is great.   We may come back for a drink but we won't be eating here again anytime soon.  Oh and they had a fly problem. We had 2-3 circling our heads for the hour we were there.

This is the type of place we need more of! I've been no less than 5 or 6 times (Sunday afternoon with friends, Dad's bday dinner, my birthday, etc) I love that there's something for everyone and the have a great mix of people. I love that they have Vinyl Station playing on Saturdays just beware that the 8pm show is usually very busy.   The pros: The pretzel fondue is a must. The outdoor space is great and there's fun backyard style games if you like that sort of thing. The food is overall very good and I've tried most of the items on the menu. I've had both good and bad service but the past few times I've been the service has been good. The atmosphere is fun and the outdoor space is my great. They have a rotating beer list.  The cons: Sometimes they have a long wait but they usually over quote. Parking can be a pain when valet is full. They don't accept reservations for groups unless your 8+ and they usually are fully committed if you call the day of. I had an issue with the hostess but our server and manager did a great job to resolve the situation when we were there 7/19.  Overall I would recommend this place to everyone just be aware that this place is popular and it's busy. Try to go on the off hours if you want to avoid the crowds. Great job Fox Restaurants!

Amazing food! Amazing service (great job Madison) I stopped in for lunch today and had a wonderful experience. (Thank you Steven) This restaurant opens Nov. 18th and I can't wait to go back.   I had the guacamole with pineapple and mint, it was very refreshing and a must for AZ warm weather, house salad, and two tacos. I tried the Urban Bean Beef and Thai Snapper. I love coffee and Urban Bean (the local coffee shop next door) so the beef was my favorite of the two. I recommend the Cilantro Dressing on everything.   The decor and ambiance is wonderful, so glad to see that they kept many elements of the old church but it still feels like a restaurant. They have happy hour on both Sat and Sunday which is really nice.   Thanks for a wonderful lunch Taco Guild, I can't say enough great things about my first dining experience! Excited to return and try the Lamb Taco and Ceviche.

Delish!!  Wisconsin beef - check Wisconsin cheese - check Sauerkraut - check  This Wisconsin girl is in heaven!   Great food and service. The menu is limited but everything seems executed very well. We will be back to try the crispy chicken sandwich. You had me at Sircha aioli.   My Ingo burger didn't stay on my plate long enough for a picture so I'm posting a picture of the Paris, Texas burger.  Thanks team INGO

Good food, clean restaurant, lots of random gift items. Bakery items looked awesome but I had a soup and salad. Portions were good and all ingredients seemed very fresh. Will back again soon.
