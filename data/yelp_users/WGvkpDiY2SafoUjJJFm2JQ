Great service, great food, great environment.   Choosing T Cooks was a great choice to celebrate our anniversary!    We arrived early enough to have a cocktail in the cozy bar before being seated at our table with rose petals scattered on the cloth.  Happy Anniversary was typed on the menu and all the staff said congrats.  We ordered the Crab Cake, Pear Salad, Paella with Lobster and the Lobster Ravioli.  Every bite was perfect.  From start to finish every flavor was spot on.  The pesto served with the bread to the Gelato with the Pineapple Upside down cake.  Wine list was arranged by characteristics (oak vs. No oak)  and had bottles starting in the $30ish range.    The server took time to answer questions about the unique property and share stories.  Even with a full dining room, we could hear each other.  My glass was always full and I never had to ask for anything.  My husband even mentioned his like of heirloom tomatoes on his crab and the server came back with a small dish for him to enjoy even more.  Another staff member came by and took our picture to send us via email.  Brilliant, yet so easy.    Did I mention they have Happy Hour from Sunday to Thursday?  They will be seeing us again soon.

I switched to this company a few years back when I kept getting conflicting reports on my AC unit at every service.  They helped me get the warranty work taken care.  I have our until checked every six months and they are always very thorough and keep me posted of all the things they do and inspect.   They became my heroes last month when we arrived back from vacation to a 95 degree house and a cramped schedule that was extra crazy because of sickness. We needed a new compressor.  In calling other referrals during my panic, the competition complimented North Valley Mechanical on their ethics and work.  The inspection was Thursday night and we had a new compressor on Saturday morning.  The cost was perfectly in line with other companies.  I am forever grateful for their speed and work.    The technician's even left a big smiley face on our unit.

Lunch time and one waiter is always a gamble.  Lunch took over an hour and all we had was apps.   The chick pea ceviche, lentil cakes and grilled eggplant all had the same over use of one sauce.  Plus lentil cakes came out look warm and the "vindaloo" sauce tasted just like "rooster" sauce.  Too many choices in the area, I will not be returning.

Arrived with a large group - You can almost see the $$ signs in the waiters and wine steward eyes.  The wine suggested was a great producer but in no way fit to be drank.  It was a huge bottle that needed to be moved and we bought in.  The waiter did not even notice the spilled sauces on the table, the crumbs in every corner, or that  silverware for next course was not all placed.  Too bad I had to ask my neighbor for her knife.  No offer of coffee or after dinner drinks.  Food was OK.  But service was offal. I prefer a quick serve restaurant that notices a detail or to.  Did I mention the 18% on an $800 dollar check.  I think I will celebrate some place else next time.
