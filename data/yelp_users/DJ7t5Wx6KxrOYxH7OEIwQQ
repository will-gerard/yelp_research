So we had a bad dinner experience prior to coming here ; and we love Wendy's but typically try to avoid fast food. The cashier Maria, was beyond friendly and answered every question with a genuine response . I haven't been here in a while ; I cringe in general when my kids want fast food . This evening showed that I will probably succumb the next instance my kids want burgers ; just because of Maria's awesome attitude. Thank you

Ok , so the minute clinic was amazing and fast . I don't really ever go to the doctors , this was my first time . It was amazing . I was sick boo, got a prescription and just had it emailed to the store pharmacy . They were extremely busy . Their tall blonde female clerk Marisa took the time to call my insurance company and find out numbers needed that weren't on my card. She went over and above . My frustration was handled with such care , time and Patience , it made the whole being sick part less of hassle . So thank you to the store and its staff. Their front cashier greeted every one of the 5 times I entered the building .

We brought our 2 kids here to eat , food was amazing . Our server Emily was knowledgable and super generous to our kids . I know my son can be a pain with his refills . We super appreciate her promptness . But to finish off the night I was explaining to my son how soda (or beer in the case of here) is made a distributed and a server by the and of Jessie went out of his way during a busy night to bring him a can from their distribution area to show as an example. It was really nice and an amazing guest experience . So thank you . !

Our server Micheal was awesome . We were one of the first tables in there at 11 am , he was patient with my in laws, who were celebrating over 30 years of marriage and a birthday too. He was helpful with suggestions . Food was great , pesto chicken sandwich , truffle fries and fish and chips . Great service and good food. Thank you .

This was our first time here, the cashier/ server Diane was very knowledgeable. Honestly we weren't sure what to expect , she guided us through the menu in great detail; while on a busy Friday night . So thank you for the cold beer, great food and awesome service .

Was excited to try a new restaurant, especially since I saw that they had a happy hour . It said on the menu appetizers are $5. When we got there at 5:50pm we were only allowed to sit outside Due to 95% of the inside being held for a 645 reservation . So for an hour our group of 6 got attacked by mosquitoes. Waiter comes and We told him which appetizers we wanted ; told him we were excited about $5 , he's said yah it's a great deal. Appetizers can fill you up . Had to ask for waters twice .Speed to bill time , we noticed the bill was ran for $10 more then was expected . We asked for the original receipt , in which the waiter said he would go find it in the garbage . We looked at the receipt that he put on the table and saw the appetizers were full price . We inquired with the server and he said , oh it's only for the corn and cheese crisp ;(which mind you are $5 all the time ) he apologized and walked away. No manager , no offering to fix it , just called it a night .

This place is still on my top 10.!! Recently the chef just got married and the lead server had a baby . I was listening to other tables talk about both scenarios . It's rare to find such a classy restaurant so invested with the staff . You can tell they have a lot of regulars . The food was amazing again , I really like the ribbon pasta with short rib; but the chef special with Arctic char was so delightful as well. And we had the Banana cream pie again plus the crime brûlée! Delicious ! The owner is actually the pastry/ dessert chef ; how cool is that . She stopped by to check on us!
