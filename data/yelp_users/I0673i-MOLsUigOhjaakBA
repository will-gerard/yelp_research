I have been to Giant many times and every time I try something different. Each and every time the food is great and the staff is very friendly always saying hi to everyone who walks through the door. So I wanted to say thank you to Doug and his staff for the great service and food I get every time I visit.   Alan

I am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salty when the waitress asked me how everything was I had to say something. She was very nice and offered me another dish but I declined. Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed. Then the owner said "well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you" and walked away. My wife and I where open mouthed, I will never return after being treated like that. If you do NOT want to hear how the food was from the customer then don't ask. I also think the owner was drinking and maybe that's why she was so mean. I run a business of my own and if I ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that I would fire them on the spot.

This place is one of my favorites. Everything is always so fresh and their soups in a bread bowl are to die for. The staff is always friendly and fast. They also deliver and do catering.

I have used this company for many years and it is always a great experience from start to finish. My company has a fleet of 7 and they are always willing to work with our busy schedule to fit us in. Always professional and clean up their mess after every job. The glass they use is better than any glass I have put on my trucks in the past. I have used many different glass companies in the past but I will be using Mountainside Glass from now on.

I have used We-Fix-It many times for my personal and company fleet many times and could not be more satisfied with their company. From the the office staff to the mechanics these guys are simply the best. If you need a honest reliable auto repair shop go no further, you will not find a better company to take of all of your auto repair needs. Thank you We-Fix-It Auto Repair you have a customer for life.
