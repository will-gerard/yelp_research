I'm not the biggest fan of chain Chinese food, but it seems to me that most the local places in the Phoenix area use such low quality ingredients for the food. This PF Changs, like most others, is fairly reliable. The food came out quickly and it was flavorful, but not necessarily exceptional.

We've been for take-out, lunch, dinner, and coffee meet-ups. Just had some take out again last night. This place is great. What I like most is the fact that they have pre-made stuff, so you can grab and go if you are in a rush. Desserts there are also great.   I would say one thing they could improve on is making the grocery store part a like less cluttered. Don't bring your stroller in there! It's too hard to navigate around without knocking into stuff!

Whether you are just looking for some cute baby stuff, or you are a cloth diapering, baby-wearing crunchy mamma like me, this is an amazing store. What's most impressive the the quality of service. The employees know so much about their products, it's really helpful when deciding what to purchase. I'm always pestering them about cloth diapering questions, and they have been so helpful!

We are frequent customers of Grassroots. Some of our favorites are the farmer's chopped salad, shrimp po boy, and key lime pie. Today we were super hungry and got the brussel sprout app. Amazing! It's cooked with bacon and a sweet balsamic glaze. Super tasty, I don't think I'll be able to dine there again without getting the brussel sprout app.

Ordered a couple tacos for myself, a bowl of veggies for the baby, and my husband got the burger. I don't have a picture of the tacos, but I ate them too quickly, they were awesome but kinda small. My husband liked his burger except that is was rather on the well done side instead of medium.   Best thing ever here was the bread pudding! Can't go wrong here.

The food here is great! I'm not sure I like the system of waiting in line to order/sit-down, but then still having to wait for the check at the end.   Almost all of what they offer are meaty burgers, but they do have one black bean patty option, or you could get a salad without the meat. Two options for kids: simple little burger or grilled cheese.   Don't come here without ordering fries. And beers come in a nice cold goblet!

Although I like the food they have, most the time I come here, the service has been terrible. Terrible-as in the worst I've ever had. Most the time I sit in the open seating section, so I understand if it takes a server a tad longer to get to us, but there have been a handful of times where we were totally ignored (like 30 minutes of sitting there for nothing) before we walked out, and another few times where they did get to us and give us poor service. I'm not sure if it's because they are discriminating against a family dining with young kids, but it's unacceptable. I would have given them one star, but they earn the two because I know I'll be ordering lunch food to-go once in a while.

A new baby store is in town, and it's awesome!! If you are looking for a place that will give you great customer service, show you how everything works, and really listen to your needs, then this is the place for you.    Reasons to shop here:   1. Great customer service.   2. There is lots of space to try out the (plethora of) strollers they have.   3. Also in stock are car seats, cribs, play pens, high chairs, and other baby lounging devices.   Last week we bought the Orbit Baby G3 toddler seat, and this week we came back to purchase a high chair that we were really impressed with... despite already having two high chairs already :)
