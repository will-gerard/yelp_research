We love Dr. Dye!  We went through a few pediatricians before we found Dr. Dye and we are so glad we found her.  Our daughter absolutely loves her.  Dr. Dye is very nice and patient, she answers all of our questions and gives great advice. The office staff is very professional and scheduling appointments is easy.  We recommend this office to everyone.

One of my favorite places to eat. The servers are great and so nice. The food is delicious. My only complaint would be the hostesses are not very friendly but I still give it 5 stars!

Love Dr. Steve!  I've always been afraid of chiropractors but Steve is so gentle and has helped me so much. He's been adjusting me through 2 pregnancies and now he does my whole family!

Such a great crossfit gym. I've been coming here for a while now and I love it, in fact, I've worked out here through 2 pregnancies.  Everyone is so nice and down to earth. No B.S. Just great workouts. They have amazing coaches who want to help you and who focus on form, which is so important. I definitely recommend CrossFit 480.

The burgers are good, except for the gross shredded lettuce, and I love the ahi salad. The service is horrible. We get take out from here often (with 2 young kids it's hard to eat out). They mess up on our order EVERY single time. Even when I tell them, they still get it wrong. It's so frustrating. They are not the nicest on the phone either, I'm guessing the hate to do to go orders.
