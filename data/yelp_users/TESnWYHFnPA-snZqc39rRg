Not a place I would stay again.  The mold and stains on everything.  It gives me the creeps to be in the rooms.  The smell in the rooms is awful, you can just tell its old and they are trying to cover up the old smell. We ended switching to rooms twice and the third room was by the pool and was a tad nicer, still appeared to be mold on the wall in the bathroom.  No stains but the chairs in this room were covered faux leather that was falling apart.  The other bad part is apparently they turned off the air in this hotel so we couldn't cool down our room to sleep.  We tried opening our windows but then we would have a cigarette smell coming in because of people who were smoking nearby.   In the morning we had breakfast that was not good almost inedible.  Eggs were flavorless, sausage tasted like it was overly flavored, and potatoes were spongy.  There was also a small selection of cereal which my kids liked and some stale bread that didn't really fit in the toaster unless you squished it in.  I was totally and utterly disappointed, we complained in the morning but the front desk guy could have cared less.

Overall it was a good experience the sales/tire guy was friendly and knowledgeable.  He gave me a few different options that I could choose from and he didn't pressure me into buying anything today.  And he was patient because I had to keep talking to my husband on the phone to try make a decision.

I have been to red robin several times and I always feel like it is overpriced.  Needless to say I still feel that way but I do like their food.  I enjoy their salads personally, today I tried the Avacabbo (I think that's how it's spelled) and was really delicious.  I did have to send it back because they brought the wrong salad out initially.  They also "lost our ticket" so my daughter didn't get her food until almost everyone else was done eating ( I was also waiting for my returned salad and silverware as well).  Everything just took forever to get to us.    Needless to say my daughter's noodles and marinara sauce cost more than a kids cheeseburger.    The manager Jeff did come by after we paid and we told him what happened and he did give us a free appetizer with purchase coupon.  I felt like my daughter's meal should have been comp'd but I am glad that they were aware of what happened.

The manager here is so rude, I have been in here once before and left because none of the employees have any amount of customer service.  My husband said to try it again so I came back today and the manager takes me back to tell me how much it's going to cost and of course all this extra stuff I "need."  When I explained I don't have $100 to spend he said "well I guess I will just put these dirty filters back in your car."  They didn't look that bad to me.  And he tried to tell me there was mold growing on my air filter, there was absolutely no mold on my air filter!

Very yummy pizza, everything is served family style.  Service was awesome, she suggested pizza with pesto and marinara sauce on it together and it was delicious!! The waitress noticed that there was a problem with our pizza and took care of it and gave us a complimentary pizza to make up for it.  Our waitress' name was Alyicia, ask for her.

My hubby and I came to Mei Wei not too sure if this was going to be good.  We went in on a Saturday night at 8pm and the place was dead, like literally there was no one else in the restaurant.  But we sat down and they gave us wonton chips and sweet n sour sauce, it was okay.  We ordered pork egg rolls, very yummy, and crab wontons, they were also yummy but a little greasy.   We weren't super hungry so we decided to just order shrimp lo mein and combination fried rice.  The shrimp lo mein was delicious!  Unfortunately the fried rice was dry and tasteless.   Overall service was awesome and food was really good.

I love the pizza, wings and salad bar.  We always get their original crust pizza which is delicious but lately they have been putting a little more sauce than I prefer so we started ordering thin crust which is so yummy!   The wings are so yummy and they offer both regular wings and boneless.

Came here with my daughters for pizza, of course all they wanted was cheese but it was a delicious!  I love that there was not a ton of sauce and the crust was crispy on the bottom.  We will definitely be coming back to try more.  I saw and smelled the garlic knots and they looked/smelled so good.  The service was awesome, our servers name is heather and she was friendly and made sure to check on us a couple of times.

We came here because we live across the street and really wanted to have some yummy food close by.  We ordered crab puffs and spring rolls/egg rolls (depending on your menu), crab puffs were a huge disappointment not enough crab meat or cream cheese.  The spring roll was ok tasting but it didn't have a lot inside of it.   There is no children's menu, I find that not to be family friendly, we ordered garlic noodles minus the mushrooms and sliced BBQ pork for my kids.  When the garlic noodles and BBQ pork came out it looked and smelled delicious, and they were both tasty.  BUT halfway through eating the garlic noodles my daughter noticed a DEAD fly in the noodles, yuck!  So they took the noodles and remade them but I was disappointed that they still charged us for the noodles.   My husband and I split the orange shrimp which had way too much breading and tiny shrimp inside.  They also skimped on the orange sauce which I would loved to have more of.   Overall disappointment...will not be back.

This place has a disgusting smell when you walk in and then the food is just ok.  My husband and I had breakfast burritos, I have to say my bacon was crispy which was the only good part.  My husband had sausage and he ended up with food poising, so we will never go back.

I really wanted this to be great but it was just ok.  The kids are all $5 and my daughter got one slice if French toast and a drink that is not much food for my money.  I got the BLAT, it was good but it says its on Texas toast but mine was on wheat toast.  My husband ordered a hot dog and it was ok but the bun was dried out and covered in a huge pile if grilled onions. The service was slow, but she was nice and friendly.  I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.

I am updating my review because the food we had this time was much better.  Although we only had appetizers and beer it was good.  We had the fried pickles that were delicious but I would rather have ranch with my pickles instead of 1000 island dressing.  Next the sliders were just ok, husband and I both said we could go without those next time.  Then the last thing was the boneless wings that were amazing!  The sauce we got l, I forget what it was called, but it was a spicy BBQ, so good!  The waiter, Marshall, was friendly and prompt.  He did get busy at the end but overall good service.

This place is not much to look at but the food is delicious!  They don't have a kids menu and the service is just ok but not bad.  This is our third visit and every time the food has been great.  The egg rolls are very tasty and not greasy.  The crab puffs are yummy but not a lot in them.  The potstickers are not my favorite but my husband liked them.    We always get the orange chicken it's awesome, not too much breading and they give you lots of sauce!  My children love the sweet n sour chicken which is also lightly breaded and has lots of yummy sauce.    We will be back!

I loved their donuts and cronuts.  They have a maple bacon donut that has bacon inside the donut!!  It was so delicious I could have had 6 more.  I want to go back to try their other food.  Yum!!

I just had a gel manicure done today.  The lady that did my nails, Wendy, was very friendly.  The atmosphere was was very spa like and beautiful.  I would go back, if I have a coupon or discount.  All the people are friendly and speak English well, so you can carry on a conversation.  It is a little more pricey.  I would give them 5 stars but I think their prices are a little too high.
