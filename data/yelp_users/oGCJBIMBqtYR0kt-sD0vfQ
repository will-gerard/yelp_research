Stopped for lunch.  Service and food are not  good.  I had the ham and cheese melt.  Bread wasn't toasted and soggy, fries were burnt.  Husband had the crispy chicken sandwich- not worth $10.  Bread was hard and not fresh, fries were burnt also.  We split a slice banana cream pie.  It was okay but nothing about it taste homemade.  As we left I heard they were under new management and I'm wondering if this is why it's going downhill?  Kinda sad as we like to support the locals.

Best in the business and very knowledgeable on what colors accent and look best.  I am so glad we choose Tim to paint our home!  Tim took the time to walk us through the procedure, discover paint palettes that compliment our home and work with the color of our roofing materials.  He was punctual, clean (not a paint drop left behind) and finished in just a matter of days!  We love the new our new color scheme and get compliments from neighbors all the time!

Rusty was back again today to make a simple repair / adjustment to our side gate and our kitchen entryway threshold that had been an issue for over a year!  Honest, reliable and always affordable.  Not just your usual "garage door" guy!  A true jack of all trades!

Not just a catering company but a bakery also!  Love the blondie brownies and chocolate Granny Smith apples!  Can wait to try them out for lunch!

Sewell was so accommodating!  He met me on location and replaced my windshield on site while in a lunch meeting!  Also made sure the glass used was of factory quality as  the last company used a lesser quality brand which increased the noise levels in my car.  My car is my office about 85% of the time so that's important!  Best in the business is my rating!
