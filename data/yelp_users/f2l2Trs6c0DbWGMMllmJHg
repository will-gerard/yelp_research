Free internet, clean and friendly people with tons of places to eat and shop.  It's seriously like a mall!  Huge and spread out so you might end up walking quite a way for a connecting flight, however, the amenities make you forget about the walk.  Plus you might need it after a meal here.  Oh yeah did I forget to mention free internet?!

This place is as good as it gets.  We called at all times of night and day and morning and they delivered everything from food, water, benadryl, sleep eye covers, tooth brushes...i realize this is their job, but the way in which is was done, the quickness, the pleasant people involved was above and beyond expectation.  Room was insane too...you get what you pay for here and more.

You know I've seen this place showcased on Food Network about 5 times in the span of 5 years or so and it looked delicious.    So during Prego 2012 (the wife) we went on our last trip prior to Ava being born to Cleveland, Ohio (I already know...relax).  So we spontaneously map the drive to Pittsburgh cause we're just wingin' this shit.  Drove 2 1/2 hours and wow were we disappointed!  I know, we sort of set ourselves up for disappointment by driving over a hour with lofty expectations but oh well...we do what we do.  How can you go wrong with pastrami, coleslaw, fries on Italian bread?!  The entire thing needed more flavor...some au jus maybe, some salt maybe?    On TV it looked like salt punch from the pastrami or corned beef, the starch and salt from the natural cut fries and Italian bread is the pinnacle of bread (for me) would be a perfect marriage but come to find out it's just a standard marriage with room for improvement (not ours dear).  I wanted to LOVE this place so much...hopefully it gets better.  All in all a great place to stop by for the nostalgia and what not but don't get your hopes and expectations in the way.

How can you make something like Pho taste like hot water and still have the nerve to call it Pho?!  When you're in Vegas you need something brothy to bring you back to life and this stuff just made it worse.  I even had to go down to pick it up because they don't deliver AND it's EXPENSIVE!    Tried the bbq pork noodle dish too and that was a huge disappointment!    I've said this before but seriously how are you still in business?!  Amazing!

Not great...seriously dumbed down Chinese.  Okay I get it, not a lot of Chinese or Asian come through Phoenix on a layover compared to the rest of the population.  But really?!  Their version of chow mein is cup o' noodles with some other sauce on it.  They are very soggy and had no depth to them at all.  A microwave could have made this stuff.  The orange chicken was hard and over battered and...that's it.  I'm surprised this place isn't called Oriental Food, cause they have no clue on what is what here.

Maybe I'm from L.A. and know what good chinese food should taste like...maybe good chinese food places I know don't wow you with decor and cleanliness...maybe I just like my chinese food cheap and greasy. We had a rather large group so we had around 7 dishes or so.  Walnut Prawns were pretty good, strange to have such a large prawn used in this dish but was cooked well, it was fresh, however, needed a bit more flavor.  The hot pot cod was the highlight, soft, flavorful and great texture.  The duck crepe appetizer was a very good start as well.  After that everything was either bland, cold, or just seriously something you could get at a regular chinese restaurant.  For these prices you should be WOW'd (at least taken on some culinary adventure, not just a two dish tour) by more than just fancy architeture...IN ADDITION, we ordered Hennessy Paradis shots and they tasted stale and not a $55 shot of cognac.

Great hotel with a very nice and friendly staff.  From what I can remember...it was bachelor party weekend and maybe I was seeing mirages everywhere but it was cool.  Never had a dull moment and everything was on point.

This place will wow you.  Well probably because our friends are the type that like to gamble a bit and they get certain benefits.  Those benefits are actually really really nice.  The kind that allow you to open and close curtains with remote controls nice.  The kind that have two rooms and a living room nice.  THANKS FRIENDS!!!  Well anyhow everyone is always very nice and quick to be at your becon call.  I know they work off tips but it just feels a bit more genuine so it feels good.  Like when you spend $100 more on sheets.  We found out that Michael Jordan is a cheap bastard and Ashton Kutcher tipped a waitress $1.00 for 5 drinks.  Inquiring minds wanna know...

I'm gonna have to give this place a perfect rating.  From reservation to bill the staff was on point.  But to the part I enjoyed most...  Ordered:  bone marrow - this was delicious...served on toast and some secret slaw salsa concoction...we finished two of these. seared foie gras - this was good but a bit on the bitter side...thinking the reduction sauce was completed on time so it left a bit to be desired but the foie was perfect and the figs balanced it well. calimari - was one of the best i've had...soft and the batter was seasoned to perfection...you almost didn't need a dip.  that good. black truffle mash - only had a couple spoon fulls of this as I could feel the butter clogging my arteries just smelling it.  it was very good though and nice compliment to the steaks. porterhouse - aged and cooked with TLC.  couldn't ask for more here.  NOW for the main event!  The server suggested this Wagyu / Angus cross bred cow called the Australian tomahawk chop (think bone-in rib eye with the dark fatty outer cap trimmed)...another yelper said theirs wasn't that good, however, ours was insanely flavorful and was awesome.  Great steakhouse...but call early because they fill up quickly.

Bit pricey, but it's delicious.  And hey it's Vegas...  We ordered too many things to remember but for the most memorable things were:   Tuna Cones - Delicious tuna sushi (poke) style in crispy cones. Imported Spanish Serrano Ham - Delicious period. Creamy Risotto - Very well done! Stuffed Dates - Not bad. Grilled Lamb Chop - Loved it. Mixed Paella - Very good paella.  Had low expectations but wow'd.  I would come here again but give it sometime so they can add and subtract from menu.  Worth the try!

Finally got a chance to try this place out this visit.  I'm bringing the wifey back next time!  Ordered:   Ox-tail chili fries - Wow i love chili fries and this is just like adding heaven to an already great side!  Must have if you like things that are fatty! Pork Belly Steamed Buns - Very refreshing and nice starter. Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu - I'm done searching for the ideal burger as it has now arrived.  It's fancy, it's big, it's rich but the way each flavor is introduced bite after bite, chew after chew it's texturally perfect and juicy is an understatement.    Some go to mecca, i'm coming here for my spiritual fix.

Phenomenal food!  Airport food no less!  Coworker and myself took a short trip to AZ and winded up here on the flight back.  Just seen this place and walked in.  Ordered: Chicken Nachos - Really good flavor...cheese was sharp and ingredients were fresh as can be.  Best part was the guac was real, not the baby food style guac!    Short Rib Tacos - Flavors and tenderness were off the charts!  I asked the waiter what the best thing was and he suggested this and man was he right.  I'll go out on a limb and say it's one of the best things I've ever ate.  Well rounded flavors and just great ingredients.  I'm coming here anytime I fly through PHX...SERIOUSLY!
