I've only eaten at the restaurant once and have ordered takeout from here numerous time as I live about a block away. Dine-in experience: I came here with a friend who raved about this place. I loved the restaurance. The atmosphere is low-key and romantic. The service is great, casual while still being professional and the food. Well It's owned by Chris Bianco (in some form or another at least) so do I really need to talk about how great the food is? Well if you're unfamiliar, the food is incredible!   Take-out experience: I love that when I order something to go they know exactly how long it will take to be ready. It means I am not made to sit and wait while my food is being prepared and at the same time it means my food isn't sitting waiting for me to get there (their pizzas are paper thin and get lose heat quickly). The staff is always friendly and personable. I love that I can buy alive oils and maranara sauce there too. I'm going to try my hand at making pizza this weekend. I bought some pizza flour, maranara and oil from them yesterday.

I went in the store on Jan 28th to ship a framed print and piece of cement home decor. To have it packed and shipped to Massachussettes was $103. I had very clear instructions to ship the item from the UPS store, using USPS. I had given the clerk my cell phone to copy the address from which she did and everything should have been fine. Exactly one month later I go to ship just a framed print (same size as the first one). This time I was being charge $118? I asked why this one was costing more than the original shipment which was heavier. I explained what I had shipped previously when the man suddenly remembered that THE PRINT AND CEMENT ITEM I HAD SENT A MONTH AGO WERE STILL THERE! I was told that the address was undeliverable via UPS. We checked the address verified it was correct. I was told they had tried calling me once. They tried calling a number that I never gave them. A number I never heard of, I don't even know where the area code they had is located! After verifying the information he said he would have it resent the following day. I asked about a refund and was told "Well I'll have to check, but technically we are still shipping it." He then walks off. I stand there waiting and he comes back a few minutes later asking if I needed something else. Yeah! How about a time frame? Is he going to call me, should I call him? This was a big refund I was asking for not a couple bucks I could just forget about. He told me to call him later that week. I called three times and went into the store once and he wasn't there any of the times and no one working there would help me. I finally went in yesterday and he was there. I was third in line and by the time I got to the front there were two more people behind me. He said I would need his "undevoted" attention and so he needed to help the other people really quickly since he was the only one there. Well he proceeded to help them as well as the other 5 people that walked in after them while I sat and waited. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes he gave me his "undevoted" attention which consisted of taking 30 seconds to give me a tracking number  from something I had previously shipped and then another 30 seconds to tell me that he had checked about the refund and was told no because the information was correct and the address is deliverable. OF COURSE THE ADDRESS WAS CORRECT! And since the address was correct and deliverable, how is it NOT their fault that it was still not delivered a month later? How is it not their fault that they had the wrong number for me? How is it not their fault that they never tried to deliver it to the store I shipped it from which is a block away! Ron said he would file an appeal and for me to come back on Friday. But he won't let me talk to anyone else. This is ridiculous

1. In January 2015, I went to trade in my iPhone 5S for a 6 at this location. After carefully looking over the salesperson said that there was a tiny dent (that I couldn't see even after he pointed it out to me) and because of that, my phone was worthless. Those were his actual words. My phone was worthless. I wound up taking my phone to a different Best Buy location a week later. I even pointed out the area that the dent was supposedly in. The sales person showed another sales person, then a manager who all agreed nothing was there and offered me full price trade in towards an iPhone 6.  2. On the above mentioned iPhone 6 that I got, I purchased the Geek Squad warranty for $10.99 a month instead of purchasing the warranty through AT&T or Apple Care. I'm one of those guys that always buys an extended warranty (except on stupid things like software/DVDs). The warranty plan I chose covers broken screen, lost/stolen phones, water damage etc. Well, I cracked my screen fir the first time ever and brought my phone in. I was told I would have to send my phone in and they would mail me a replacement which would take up to 7 days without a phone, or I could pay and have my credit card on file and have them ship me a phone first then I would return my phone. I opted for that option. I was then asked if I knew about their service fee. I said no and was told that I have to pay my deductible which was $149. He then corrected himself and said it wasn't $149, but $199. I asked why it was more expensive to get my phone screen replaced there WITH my warranty than to go ANYWHERE else. He said he didn't know that was there policy. I asked him something else which prompted him to look at his screen and he apologized and told me he was once again wrong and that it would be $249. He asked if I wanted to do it. I told him no because its ridiculously overpriced and gets more expensive everytime he opens his mouth.   So finally fed up with other issues I was experiencing with my phone, I took it to the Apple Store. I showed up for my appointment they did a few tests and wound up restoring my phone and told me to take it home and try it out for a few days. I asked what I would do if the problems persist and was told to bring it back and they will swap it out. I asked about the screen, They told me they could replace it for $109 there in store in under 30 min, but to wait to see if they need to swap it out first. I asked about the deductible and was told there is no deductible since its still under warranty.  I love Apple. They've always treated me right.  As for Best Buy, I would probably never go back. Not worth my time or money

Everytime I come here they seem to have less and less men's items, specifically designer jeans, which also seem to be getting more and more expensive.  Selling stuff is a bit different here too. It's consignment so it doesn't quite work the same as Buffalo Exchange where you bring them stuff they take what they want and give you cash or credit on the spot. Here, they buy on consignment so they chose the items they want and you get money based on what they sell for AFTER they sell. And they have sales ALL the time it seems. Last time I went I sold them 4 pieces and went in today, 3 wks later and nothing sold. Of course nothing they took from me was out on the floor. I literally went through every piece. Nothing. Seems kinda shady.

I really loved eating here and plan on coming back soon! I came here with two friends. Service was a little slow at first but was acknowledged and apologized for immediately. (To apologize our server brought us a piece of this cake at the end of our meal. It's not on the menu, I'm not sure what it was. It was topped with Phyllo dough and honey and the cake part was kinda like a cheesecake but not, it was a different texture, lemony with lemon rind in it and not very sweet but it was VERY good. I quite enjoyed it. Perfect way to end the meal. Now to rewind and go back to the start, we had a couple appetizers. We started with the Bruschetta - $3.95 and the Veggie Combo - $10.95 The bruschetta was incredible! I could have made that my meal. The veggie combo was also just as good, BUT I have to say this: For those who don't know, Spanakopita is Phyllo dough filled with spinach, onion and feta cheese. "Spanaki" in greek means spinach. There was NO spinach or onion on this. Just Phyllo and cheese. It was still so, SO good, I mean you can't go wrong with cheese and dough right? But I wanted spinach and onion! The falafel looked like a hush puppy from Long John Silvers, but was a hundred times better. For my entree I had the Lamb Souvlaki Dinner - $12.95. So tasty, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  mmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Oh note to the staff. When it's night and people are sitting on the patio, light a candle and turn on your decorative outdoor lights. Some of us like to see what we eat!. Still 5 stars!

Okay, so it's not their fault that the parking sucks like no other....it makes me feel like I'm back in L.A. though! The atmosphere here is fun. It's noisy, it is great for people watching and there are a lot to see (and, if you're like me, BUY) The staff always seems to be smiling, and are helpful when asked, BUT this will never be the Nordstrom of restaurants. So here are the things you have to try! They are WONDERFUL! Mia's French Pancakes Croque Madam Commuter Sandwich (either with avacado or salmon, both are great) Jersey Girl Omelete The Cubano Sandwich The Rueben Guacamole BLT I forget the name, but its either a Spanish or a Mexican Latte is wonderful!  I also love the little pickle slices  they serve!! So good! The Tammy Coe cakes are so good too! I love the designs! very creative use of fondant!

Ok, so I miss the Whole Foods in L.A., but its no different than this Whole Foods. I just don't get to stand in line behind Taye Diggs or have Drew Barrymore ask me if I had ever tried their prepared pasta salads. I am living in Phoenix now and will be moving soon (within Phoenix still).  I have narrowed down my apartment search to locations with a Whole Foods within 3 miles. Is that sad? Their prepared foods area is quite good but pricey. Make sure you don't go to get dinner when you're really hungry because it is REALLY easy to walk out with like $40 worth of food. Shopping here has taught me more about reading/understanding food labels, thus eating healthier but has also enabled me to try new things that I never would even have access to by just going to my neighborhood Fry's. Now as much as I love Whole Foods, I unfortunately go there for specific items, not my entire grocery list. Too expensive for that. Maybe I should get a second job there?

This must be the place that seasonings forgot... I came here last night with two others. I had been there before but it had been years  and I don't recall anything about that experience.This trip however was just as the rating implies: "Meh. I've experienced better." Our server was friendly, but not personable. Some people just aren't, and that's ok. The chips and salsa were great, I really enjoyed them. I wish their spicy salsa was spicier though. We started with an order of chips and guacamole. I don't think anything was added to the avocado. Maybe some diced up tomato? I could be wrong, but it really just tasted like mashed up avocado and a slight touch of lemon maybe? Probably more to keep it from turning brown, than for flavor. But there was no, or at least very little, salt and pepper. Our entrees came out shortly after and it was the same story. Everything looked delicious, but was really lacking in flavor. I had the nachos with ground beef which I would usually love anywhere else but was very unimpressed.  This was just "meh",

So strictly from an entertainment aspect, Organ Stop Pizza great! It really is a lot of fun. It was something different. The music and....choreography (maybe?) are awesome. Ok, there's no dancing but window slats and lighting and whatever move in time with the music. (Wow, possibly worst description ever. My apologies). But it's 2013 and a nice venue, but still is cash only? What also makes no sense to me is why I have to order and pay for my food at one register, and if I want a drink, I have to wait in a different line to do a completely separate transaction? And then there's the food. I read other reviews, ignoring the food, but come on now. IT'S A RESTAURANT! It's 90% about the food and the food sucked. Peter Piper Pizza has better food than this place. There was no redeeming quality in anything we ordered.  They say even bad pizza is still good. Not true. This was the first time in my nearly 33 year existence that I didn't take my left overs home. We had no desire to take them home. With the music and everything surrounding the Mighty Wurlitzer, I don't understand why they can't charge a few more dollars for better quality pizza. This place would probably be spot on the gourmet pizza, waiters, private tables and booths (instead of school cafeteria style tables/benches). It's obvious the owners are strictly in business for the money. They're penny pinchers. Why else would it be cash only (no transaction fees), low quality food (costs less to make), picnic bench style seating (cram as many people in as possible) and poor service (cheap labor). I want to go somewhere that wou can taste the owner or chef's passion for the food in the food.  The only saving grace is the organ. I go to a restaurant to eat. Entertainment is just a bonus.  I won't be back.

So as you can tell by the previous review, I was pretty impressed with the prices of various products on my last trip to Best Buy, but wow the costs for their services is ridiculous. My parents bought me a car stereo on Christmas Eve. As I picked one over budget I paid for the installation. And as it was the last one on the shelf, I also bought the installation kit for my car since no employee was around to help me, I figured better safe than sorry. The kit was $22 and I was still charged $80 for the installation. So basically I paid $102 for the installation. I was however impressed with the speed in which the stereo was installed. Forty-five minutes. But still $102 to install a $162 stereo? Its my fault for not doing some shopping around first. Fry's Electronic has same stereo, $10 more and $20 install. Audio Express has the same stereo for $37 more with $1 install... As you can see from my review on Absolute Computers in February, its common for Best Buy to charge such outrageous fees. http://www.yelp.com/biz/absolute-computers-paradise-valley#hrid:Kdb_Vx1vgQOHujxXVSixnA They also do window tint. 3 years ago I had old tint removed and new tint put in an old truck. It had 5 windows, cost $75. On a whim I asked what it would cost to have the 2 front windows (passenger and driver) get new tint (and have the old tint removed). Quoted price was $125. For two windows.

I love their southwestern chicken ceasar salad! I visited recently thought and ordered a snicker doodle and a hot chocolate. $6 Yes, 1 cookie and 1 hot chocolate $6  Why is that so upsetting? They make it in front of you. And let me tell you how. They get a cup. They put hot water in it They open a packet of carnation hot chocolate and mix it in the water. They put the lid on and give it to me. Yes really.  Plus, the drink was SO hot that my hand was burning through the cup sleeve AND the lid started melting.  I went to Starbucks and we had a good laugh at their expense.

I had never been to Sweet Tomatoes until today. I have been to Souper Salad many times before and I expected it to be similar but better.  Well, I will start with the good.  Okay and now the so-so. I had the chocolate bread muffin. It was tasty, and chocolaty, but dark chocolaty. Not sweet at all really. Like I said, it was good but as it was not sweet, it was not dessert, and as it was chocolate it didn't really go with anything else. I moved on to try the chocolate bread pudding concoction they had. That was REALLY good, but it was almost gone so I only got the edges. I got hardly any of the gooey chocolaty messiness that I truly wanted. This dessert probably would have been in the good category if I had gotten some 5-20 minutes earlier.  And now for the bad. I'll just start from beginning to end. Raw beets = not good! Dry, stale spit most of my first bite out. The light ranch tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. The regular ranch was watered down. They were out of Coke, Dr. Pepper and Rootbeer and only had ice at the cashiers station, not in the soda fountain. The Chinese orange happy chicken salad had no chicken and I was not happy! I moved onto the soups. First I tried the 3-cheese tortellini soup. I couldn't taste any cheese and the tortellini was mush. The broth was flavorful but I still only had 3 bites. I moved on to the Irish Potato and Leek soup. It was pretty tasty actually but I still had to doctor it up with salt pepper and cream cheese because it was otherwise rather bland. I also took a bite of the chicken noodle soup. It had big chunks of chicken in it. Big, dry, overcooked pieces of chicken. It was also bland. Should have had some veggies in it. The mac n "cheese" was soupy and also bland. You won't catch me back here anytime soon!

I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. All over $9.  The whole thing started on Saturday when I purchased 3 dresses for my niece during the one day sale. I bought them at Colonnade. The sale was a one day sale on girls tank dresses for $7. The dresses were clearly marked $7 and there were a mix of solids and print. I bought 3 with prints.  The dresses I picked were all from the side of the display rack that had a $7 sign. They weren't just one or two mixed in there were full size runs. The other side of the rack had tunics for $8.50.  I was charged $10 each. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until this morning when I looked at the receipt. I live by Arrowhead and that's the location I went to for a price adjustment receipt and dresses in hand. I waited in line for 10 minutes before someone helped me. The cashier checked with whom I assumed to be an assistant manager or lead. I was told that the Arrowhead location didn't have this style (same style just a print instead of solid) on sale but they would call the location I went to for verification. I waited for nearly 10 minutes and in front of me the cashier told the same lead that the Colonnade location had put them on sale for $7 because they had such little inventory of the ones that were actually on sale. He then asked if he should just refund me the difference. She told him no and went to check with the store manager. After waiting another 5 minutes she came back and said if I wanted the price difference I would have to take it to the Colonnade store for a refund. I asked to speak with the manager. We waited 10 more minutes for her to come out. From the start she was defensive and rude. She told me that she called that store (because apparently she didn't believe the employee that had already called them in front of me) and told me that I was wrong they never had the dresses set up like that and if there was a mistake, it was that store's mistake and they would be the ones that needed to fix it not her. That's right. She said. Multiple times actually. I told her I am not driving 25 min to get a price refund and she said I can keep the dresses or return them. I asked for a refund and she told me to get back in line and walked off. This behavior is completely uncalled for by anyone no matter what store it is or what their position is. The price difference wasn't huge and I probably would have kept them. I was even planning on doing some more shopping. My mom even had several items in her hand and put them back. I won't ever be back.

worst return policy in the world! even with a receipt! be careful if you do a partial payment with a gift card!!  Experience 1 - I purchased Nip/Tuck season whatever ($40), a sweater ($28) and the Black Eyed Peas cd ($12) online from target.com. I paid mostly with my debit card, but I had used the last $9 of a gift card as well. I printed the order confirmation everything showed exactly as I ordered it. I get my items and instead of the Black Eyed Peas Cd I get the Nip Tuck soundtrack. I go to return it to the store. I can'y because althought they carry the cd, that portion of the order was fulfilled by amazon.com NOT target.com. So I bought the cd there in store and called target to find out about returning it for a refund and a credit on the shipping. They would only refund the cd to the gift card and no refund on shipping since the nip tuck soundtrack was on the invoice, it must be my mistake even though my order confirmation shows no signs of the nip tuck sndtrk. When I read them their own return policy stating simply that refunds will be credited to the original form of payment and since the cd was priced higher than the value of the gift card the refund should be credited to my debit card. The representative then lead me to a SECOND return policy that was similar but stated that the entire amount would be refunded to the gift card since i used a target gift card for a portion of the payment. Now to get to this second refund, I had to type the URL into the address bar of my browser. The rep was unable to tell me how to navigate to it from their site. There were no links to get to it. It was a static page that required you to type the address in manually. How would I have ever known that??  Experience2 - I purchased some nice metal shower curtain hooks ($16). They kept catching on the shower rod tho as the rod was too thick around. I went to return them. I had no receipt and I paid cash. My fault.  I went to exchange it for a $65 mirror which I was told I cannot do since I didn't have the receipt I could only exchange it for something of equal or greater value (the mirror was greater) and from the same department. IT WAS FROM THE SAME STORE WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT DEPARTMENT IT WAS FROM?? Oh and I couldn't get store credit I had to use it that same day.

Cons: Parking No Banana Republic or Gucci Paradise Bakery is the closest thing to a coffee shop here  Pros: Apple Store Great Restaurants Valley's only Saks Fifth Avenue (as well as a few other Biltmore exclusive boutiques, Saks is just my favorite) Dog Friendly Movies in the park Great revitalization done here.   The parking situation kept this from being a 5 star review. Parking in the back is free, parking in the front is either valet or has a charge (unless validated, then two hours are free). There are two issues with parking in the front. As Julia T. pointed out, atleast 60-70% of the spots in front are reserved for valet, but with the exception of Friday and Saturday night are 90% empty. The issue with the paid parking is there are no attendants and no way to pay cash. Credit card only. 99% of the time that is fine as I almost NEVER have cash on me. One time though, I had forgotten my debit card at home (I was shopping online the night before) had cash and my credit card. As I go to leave, my parking charge comes out to $1. I go to pay, I swipe my credit card and keep getting an error message. It worked fine at lunch and at the Coach store moments before! I have cash and no way to use it. Two cars are behind me. Luckily my friend is in the first car and comes to my rescue! Other than that issue, I really love coming here. Whether just to walk around and people watch, grab a bite with friends (all the restaurants here are good. Seriously, all of them!) It's a good mix of stores, though I do really miss Banana Republic and Gucci and wish the new J. Crew had men's clothing and Lululemon had a larger selection of men's clothing, but no one seems to listen to me. It's very dog friendly, some stores even have water dishes out front for dogs. If it wasn't for AZ's leash laws, I would bring my dog. She doesn't leave my side but will freeak out the moment she so much as sees a leash. Great mix of restaurants, different types of food and price points.

Parking is still on my "cons" list but can usually park in the back or the garage for free. I still don't understand the need for the pay lots. Union has been open for a few months now and I love it there. There is a coffee shop (Royal, it's wonderful) as well as some great locally owned shops like For the People, Bonafide Goods and Queen Creek Olive Mill. There is a relatively new J. Crew, however it is a women's only store.  So I liked it before and absolutely love it now!

I always enjoy myself when I come here! ! mean come one cheap food! $1.75 margaritas! How could you go wrong? Sure they're not top shelf margaritas and maybe a tad watered down but they are better than what I initially expected from a $1.75 margarita. Seriously people. You're complaining about a $1.75 margarita? Are you never happy?? Now for the food. I love their food. That baja sauce!!!! I could eat that off anything! I would put it on my pancakes if I could! I have tried numerous menu options and always enjoyed what I had. The Nachos Baja Chicken Burrito Patio Taco (a deep fried FLOUR tortilla, not corn) Those are my favorites. (I'm not going to name beers because those are the same whether you get em at Mi Patio or a grocery store) It's a fun place to come with a few friends, drink a few cheap margaritas, good cheap food in big portions... You definitely get more than your money's worth here.

I do not like coming to this one. Do not like it at all! I come here because it is half way between where I live and my friend lives. Two stars because they are remodeling soon! Thank God for that! It looks like they are making some huge changes! As for now it doesn't look like this gym has had any sort of updates since it opened. It's dirty, it smells....ugh I can't tell you how any of the staff is because I never see any one working there except the front desk clerk who completely ignores me to talk to his friends. I just found out theres another location less than two miles away, We will go to that one and hope they start and finish the remodel at this one soon!

Was out shopping with a friend before going to see a movie. It was 106 degrees outside so we first stopped at Starbucks for some iced drinks. Out drinks both had lids. Upon entering Ross we were immediately asked to throw out our drinks or leave. We left. It's 106 outside in Phoenix, AZ. Ross is located in an OUTDOOR strip mall. My drink had a lid on it. I am 30 years old, not some obnoxious child.

By far the most amazing people I could ever wish for.  I went to three other florist in the same day all telling me anything on pintrest and in magazines doesn't exist in nature.   Deanna and her niece were so amazing to us. They are all young and hip to all the trends that are happening in the wedding and flower world. Their entire staff was so supportive and encouraging. I knew that my friend's wedding would be amazing and to not worry.  I would recommend them to everyone!!!

I've been a loyal Nordy's customer for years. I even worked there for about four years in the past. In recent years, it sure seems their customer service is slipping. Men's Rail never has been a department I've recognized for their customer service. It was never bad service by any means, It just wasn't Nordstrom quality service. I've felt no sense of loyalty with any associate in that department becuase, thought friendly, they never seemed to care much. It's the department I do the majority of my Nordstrom shopping, but no one ever remembers me from my previous shopping trip (no matter how recent), I've never been sent a thank-you card, and though I have asked numerous times, I've never been called about sales or new items. I will describe my last couple visits to the Rail. Earlier this year I was rummaging through a sale rack. I was completely ignored, while the three associates there helped customers who were perusing the regular priced racks. Not only that, but two female associates were talking about one of the sale shirts (that i was holding in my hand). One girl said she wasn't sure if she liked it, she'd have to see it on her boyfriend, but it might be "too ugly" for her to let him wear. The other girl replied "Yeah, the color is a little gay." Now, they weren't talking about it because it was in my hand, and I don't feel they were homophobi My last visit started the most recent string of events that really have left me questioning any future shopping at the store. I had another pair of jeans I brought in for a repair. I was again offered an exchange but I was insistant on the rapair because I really loved them and they didn't have them anymore. I was wanting a small tear repaired and was originally planning on shipping them out to New York to have them rewoven. I instead opted to try Nordstrom, hoping to save a few bucks (atleast the cost of shipping to and from NYC). Well I was shocked when the associate asked the manager how to ring it up and she said to do it as "Customer's own goods, no charge". I told her the jeans are a couple years old, it's just from wear and tear, not a defect. I was told not to worry about it and needless to say I was very excited. I was planning on spending about $20-25 for the repair. I asked how the repair would be done and they said they would be rewoven. Even better! So I clarified that they would be actually rewoven and not patched. I was told yes, that was correct. So they took them in and gave me the date of 6/4 that I could come in and pick them up. Well that date came and went. I was so busy I didn't get a chance to go get them. No big deal, I wasn't in a rush. On 6/12, the associate that had helped me originally called me about the jeans asking if I had wanted them shortened. I said no, just the repair that I brought them in for. He didn't know what repair and I described what I wanted. He told me he just found the original slip, the pants had not been touched yet, but he would put a rush on it and ship them to me for no extra charge. He said I should get them by Saturday or Monday. Well that didn't happen. I called this past Thursday and spoke with the department manager and explained the situation. He said he was the only one on the floor but would look for them and call me back later that day. That didn't happen either. I called back the next day. He tells me "I'm sorry, you must not have gotten my message." Well of course I didn't get your message! You didn't call me so you obviously didn't leave me a message either! Well that is what I wanted to say. But I was nice. He said the jeans were going out that day. That DID happen and I got them the following day!! Thankfully they had not been shortened, but they also were not rewoven. They were patched and then stitched over the patch. I'm annoyed, but the thread they used is a perfect match and they did do a good job. The work is very subtle and hardly noticeable. This is just not the level of service I would expect from this store, regardless of what department I am in. I know I probably shouldn't complain about a free service, but I didn't expect or ask for it to be free...

I had made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday. They tried to transfer me to a special events coordinator whom I did not want to speak to and didn't seem to understand that I didn't want some package deal, I wanted two lanes and everyone was paying for their own games and food/alcohol. It took more explaining than I felt necessary but I was able to make the reservations for two lanes, no extras. I was quoted a price of $17.99/person for unlimited bowling, shoes included, from a certain time until they closed. We weren't getting there until 9 so that was perfect and we could bowl 3 or four games each over the course of 3 hours or so. So we get there and are told that deal doesn't exist and hasn't for quite some time. The current price was $12.99 (cheaper, yay!) for unlimited bowling for only 2 hours. We were all disappointed, but it wasn't too big of a deal. So we start to bowl and our server comes over. We order and two members of our party asked the server if we could have separate bills and were told yes. Through out the course of the next two hours we all ordered combinations of individual beer bottles, pitchers of beer, buckets of beer and cocktails. Our service was fast, but definitely not friendly or helpful. He would come and drop drinks off and run off, not asking if anyone else needed anything. Three different times they were out of something that was ordered, not the servers fault, but it is annoying. The end of our two hours comes and we get brought the bill. Not as much as I expected, but everything was on one bill. What an unpleasant experience that was! Our server brought over the assistant manager to assist in sorting things out.They were both visibly annoyed with us to the point of being rude. Don't blame us, we asked for separate bills. Twice! And we were told you could accomodate us. We wound up moving to the bar to continue drinking while we sorted out the bill. When one of my friends went to order, the bartender rudely told us she would not serve us because we weren't paying our bill. By that point half the bill had been paid, we were sorting out the rest and no one (at that point) was arguing about paying anything. Plus my friend that she was declining was trying to pay cash. Upon sorting out the check, we discovered we were charged for three drinks we had been told they were out of. After it was all sorted and paid, the server and manager left and the bartender continued to be rude. We were not drunk or belligerent or doing anything to harrass her. We were drinking, joking, laughing and taking pictures. There was no reason for any of them to have acted as they did. We were a large party (12 people), we had made reservations ahead of time so they knew how many people were coming, we asked for separate bills up front, it wasn't a surprise, we didn't try to skip out on the bill, we didn't leave a mess and we weren't disrespectful.

I've always loved Pita Jungle. I was so excited to discover they opened a new one by me in front of Arrowhead Towne Center (even though I still have not been there yet...) We always start with the cilantro and jalapeno hummus. Just a tip: the small is a big serving. Usually perfect for 3-4 people. Just order extra pita or veggies. I have loved everything I ever tried there. This time I had the Seafood Provencal. It was so good I wanted to lick the bowl clean. I've tried many things here and it seems Pita Jungle can do no wrong. This needs to become a new staple for me.

Had such a great time here! I came here with coworkers as part of a team building activity. There was only 6 of us and some had never climbed before and we also had avid climbers. The staff was great and made me feel very comfortable. It was great I had so many different types of walls to climb. I can't wait to go again. Maybe when it's a bit cooler though. They only seem to have swamp coolers and fans which is no match for an Arizona summer day.

I've never been one to hit up the Mill bar scene. At nearly thir....at my age, I just assumed it was all going to be the obnoxious college crowds everywhere.  Rula Bula was definitely not what I expected at all! Thankfully! It was fun, low key, laid back. The place is cute, the crowd was mixed, the drinks came fast and the staff was friendly. We came too late to try the food and being that only one of us ordered a mixed drink, I can't justify giving it 5 stars based on beer and service alone. I will be back to try the food and update then. I predict a 5 star rating in the future.

You have meat, and its drenched in sauce. How could you go wrong? Ask Tom's BBQ, they'll tell you! So I had the beef tips and chicken. Both heavily smoked and drowned in the same sauce. Beef and chicken...two completely different animals, but both tasted identical. The spicy sauce was bland and didn't have the slightest kick to it. The beef tips were overcooked, tough and chewy. The bone in the chicken was broken in two places and grossed me out. The fries were really good tho. Everything else ended up in the trash.

I've been here a few times and have ordered by the slice as well as a fresh baked pie. I hadn't been there in 2 years though, so when some friends and I decided to go to Glendale Glitters, I was very excited to have to opportunity to come back and eat here. Even when ordering by the slice (when the pizza has been sitting out and reheated) the pizza always tastes fresh and the crust has the perfect crunch. When we got there this last time the line was out the door. The staff never missed a beat and was fast and friendly. The restaurant was packed and noisy, but the restaurant was clean and staff made sure they were heard when they called our names.  I should come back more often!

Definitely a family staple.I'm not sure what some of the negative reviews are about. It's family owned/operated and has been around for YEARS. It has never once smelled of anything but food when I walked in (and smoking is not allowed indoors in Phoenix- hasn't been for YEARS). The restaurant is well lit as is the parking lot. They keep the chips and salsa coming - FOR FREE. Their food is homemade, not canned. Their salsas are fresh and flavorful, though none have a real kick. The only thing I have tried and didn't like were the fajitas. They were definitely not the same kind of fajitas you would get at a more Americanized Mexican restaurant. I've never tasted any weird touches or after tastes in their food. It tastes as authentic as anyone in my family has made or anything I had even in Mexico.

My family has come here for years and the staff has been there even longer. They all know us and know exactly what we like and how we like it. I am always willing to try new things. I let Winnie surprise me and she knows exactly what I'll like everytime. I always make sure to visit when I am in Phoenix. Can't wait to come back!

The outlook was grim.  Broken timing chain (or belt, I'm not sure) and an interference engine. Not a good combination. Apparently, with that type of engine, when the timing chain goes, so do the engine valves. It happened while I was stopped at a light (thankfully!) so I had it towed to Pep Boys. $89.99 just to diagnose the problem. When they called me and told me what the problem was they told me that it was a timing chain and IF there was no damage to the engine valves total repairs would cost $1209 (there were other repairs that needed to have been done a while ago), but if there was damage to the engine valves then the bill would be almost triple that amount. The only way to find out the extent of the damage was put the new timing chain on which would cost me $500 even if the valves were bent and I decided not to complete the rest of the work.  I decided to take a gamble and authorized the work. I was called when the work was completed and to my surprise I was given a different amount than what was originally quoted to me...nearly $100 LESS.  I assumed that it was because they had given me a discount because of a small mix up when I first brought my car in. It was not. I was still given the discount and the final bill came to $922! I am very happy with the work that was done as well as the generosity and professionalism of the mechanics that I spoke with. They all showed genuine concern about the car and spoke to me in a way that was clear and easy for me to understand. (I'm the guy that doesn't even know how to change a tire)

So my family has taken our cars to Hans for years now. Hans has by proven himself to be trustworthy and fair. We almost always get our cars back the same or next day other than a few times and that was only because it took an extra day to get the part (not his fault I'm sure!) This most recent time, I was actually a bit flabbergasted at the price he quoted me. Especially after I did some research online. A new AC compressor? $1000?? Yikes! The dealership quoted me $1000. No difference, I realize that, but dealerships are always much more expensive, especially compared to Hans.  Now what it turned out to be is that I got a brand new AC compressor directly from the dealer.  The price also included "freon, evacuate & recharge a/c system, flush a/c system, inspect for leaks" which would have been extra if repaired at the dealership. And we got the car back within 24 hours! Happy customer once again Hans! Thanks!

I'm torn on how to rate them. Four stars? Five? It's in between the two options, but I think just slightly closer to four. The food, especially the pasteries are excellent, the coffee is always perfect just as it is. I don't have to modify my order ever. The music is just a weird mix which is easy (usually) to tune out. My main complaint is theyre always busy so the service is always rushed and never friendly. I mean they're not rude, far from it. It's just that no one there is personable or warm.  I love the location though. It's walking distance from me, so I am there with my dog at least once a week.

Delux is one of these places that I can go to and guarantee that whatever I order on the menu will be fantastic! They don't have a large menu, but everything, including the service, is great.  Most recently I ordered the hot dog. Its 1/4 pound of tastiness. I ordered with onion, the spicy beaver mustard (I had no idea what it was, I mainly ordered it because the name made me giggle) and jalepenos. It was so good!! So, so good! With the exception of the fish sandwich (which is also nothing less than incredible) everything on the menu under $10. You do have to order the fries ala carte (with the exception of the hot dog which comes with a half order of fries). If you order the fries, a half size order is perfect or get a full sized mixed cart of fries to share with the table.

I was very pleasantly surprised when I went to Fez for the first time. I'm not sure why though...I mean I've heard nothing but good things and I have been to and loved Ticoz, but I still didn't eaxpect much from Fez. The atmosphere was great. Lively and fun, the decor was relatively simple, modern and overall appealing. I think what I had the lowest expectations of is service. After having lived in L.A. the past two years I guess I figured that trendy restaurants = mediocre food and lousy service from snooty, pretentious wanna-be actors. I was definitely in for a surprise. The waiter was awesome! Friendly, attentive without being annoying, great at making suggestions.  He recommended that I have the Fez burger. I was a little apprehensive about it though, I mean a spicy honey molasses bbq with cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, & cilantro? Nothing seemed like it went together, but it was wonderful. Sweet, a little spicy, a little garlic-y.  The only thing that was so-so was the garlic rosemary fries. They were a little too cooked and the flavor was a bit too strong. I think next time I will try the sweet potato fries. Coming back soon!

Ok, so first for the bad:  So the first time I went there was when some friends invited me. They were already at the restaurant, I was still in bed at home in Avondale. I showered, dressed and drove over there...they were still waiting for a table. In fact once I got there we waited another 30 minutes for a table. that means my friends were waiting over an hour and a half for a table. My other complaint is that my potatoes are always too burnt, even when I tell them not to burn them. They are closed on Monday (you would have thought I would remember this the first two Monday;s I came to eat here) So now for the good: Everything else! I love the food! The Chop & Chick and griddle cakes are my fave for breakfast and for lunch I love...well just about everything! Can't wait till I move back so I can go again!!

DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER! So a friend invited me to karaoke here. I had never heard of it before, but when she gave me the address my first thought was "Screw that! I'm not going to a bar in that area!"  But I forced myself to go anyway. It had been a long week and I needed a drink. So I find this place and again thought "Screw this, I'm outta here!" Its right behind the (SL)EZ-In Motel and in a very industrial kinda scary part of town that I drive through every day to and from work. I had actually seen the bar hundreds of times before and was never compelled to stop in. That said, I am SO glad I forced myself to go. The area of town it's in isn't the best and looks rather shady.  This is proof as to just how looks really are deceiving! The area was quiet and safe. The inside of the bar was spotless. It was clean, warm and inviting. I met Renee and one of her staff (or business partner maybe, not sure) Desiree (please tell me I got her name right!) They both are so friendly and welcoming. They shook my hand, remembered my name, made small talk with me. It was great!  I definitely felt like I belonged. The people singing karaoke were really good too. I was expecting something reminiscent of Cameron Diaz in My Best Friend's Wedding but I was wrong. Listening to them, you almost forgot you were listening to an amateur performing at a karaoke night. They were a pleasure to listen to! And the man performing MC Hammer's Can't Touch This was hilarious!!! The DJ was great too. apparently it was his first time and I never would have known. He seemed very comfortable and had a great personality. I would have stayed longer, but I was hungry and needed to eat before I wasn't able to drive myself home. Definitely planning a trip back!

My friend just raved about the food so I was very excited to give this a try. A group of five of us stopped by for dinner before First Friday Art Walk this month. The place was busy so there was a bit of a wait, just about 15minutes or so, not bad. We were seated and placed our drink orders. Our waitress was great. Very friendly and prompt.  It took FOREVER to get our food. So long that one member of our party had to leave as soon as it came.  This was (seemingly at least) in no fault of our server however. She did check in on us frequently and let us know that it was coming, there was just a large party ahead of us. We got our good and it was delicious. I had the Salmon Spinach Enchiladas. It was wonderful very tasty. The chipotle cream sauce drizzled on top was soooo good! I tasted my friend's Chicken Relleno, also very tasty, however hers was a bit on the dry side. She has had it before and said it was not usually as dry. The only other issue I had with the food is that it wasn't hot It wasn't cold by any means, I just got the sense that it was left out for a while. I would give this 3 and a half stars, but with as flavorful as the food was and how excited my friend was to come here I rounded up. I will definitely be back soon and am expecting to be able to give it a higher score next time.

Just as expected, 5 stars this time. I came here with three other friends on New Years Day and we were seated promptly. The entire staff, from the manager, to host, to bartenders were extremely friendly and welcoming. Our server was exceptionally great, offered a variety of recommended items and explained the new items on the menu. We started out with margaritas and chips with guacamole; a delicious way to start a meal might I add. At Chico's request, I had the West Coast Burrito. Now I mean this in the most positive way possible, but I think whomever it was that came up with this concoction must have been high at the time. It was a tortilla stuffed with amazingness. Shrimp, carne asada, avocado, chipotle sauce, FRENCH FRIES.... It was sssoooo good. Everything went together perfectly. I might go back later today to order it again today!

Location = F Staff = B+ Decor = F Food = A- Overall = C  Not street visible, you have to turn into the Walgreen's and drive through the parking lot past the store and turn left when you see the Wide Shoe store. GPS and Mapquest did not provide very accurate directions...  The staff was all young but friendly. I was with a few friends who, like myself, had never been there before and another group of people had come in just a minute or so before us. One of the youngins behind the counter was giving us all lessons in ordering and giving us samples of their most popular menu items.  The decor was odd. Exposed duct work, cheap collapsible tables. The kind my parents own but keep in the shed until we have a a big party. Menu items typed on sheets of paper, laminated and stapled to the wall...it just seemed so hole in the wall, so...ugh  The food was, as my friend called it, "stoner food". I got the pork carnitas quesadilla and the jade chicken with black beans and chicken fried rice. It was all really good! Flavorful, tender.....mmmmmmmmmmmm. My only complaint was that the beans tasted like they had been thrown in the blender instead of hand mashed. No texture I'm looking forward to a return trip. The items I gave F's to are not going to keep me from coming back! I am already planning on what to eat next.  Oh and that volcano cookie is out of this world!

What a great place! Very cute, inside and out. We sat on the patio as the weather was beautiful. I was here with my family and this was our first time at Haus Murphy's. I'm always up for trying new things it was just a chore trying to get my dad to agree. We started with the Sausage Sampler ($9.95) which was really good. The only thing that would have made it better is if we had another type of sausage. I don't consider 2 types of sausage to be a sampler platter. I had the Schweizer Schnitzel ($14.95) which apparently is a Swiss traditional meal, tender Pork Loin wrapped with Emmenthaler Cheese and Black Forest Ham, breaded and sautéed with the Chef's Paprika Sauce (an extra $2) It came with the German fried potatoes - which are fried in bacon grease. Everything was really REALLY good. Now the food all seems to be rather fragrant as you could smell all the great food everyone else was eating. I was expecting it to be very flavorful. Like an explosion of taste when I bit in. It was not. The tastes of everything were simple which I think I enjoyed more than I normally would have. I was able to concentrate and define various flavors a bit easier than normal I guess. It came with this creamy cabbage concoction which was superb!  For dessert I had something that sounded truly disgusting but was WONDERFUL. The Sauerkraut cake. It is a rich moist chocolate cake without a hint of sauerkraut taste. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I will definitely be back. I think this would be a fun place to go with a large group of people! Maybe next time I will have to try some of their beer and definitely the giant pretzel. Oh and the waiter was superb. I think my mom even developed a little crush on him.

I love Frances! Great mixture of clothes, accessories, gifts and home items. There was a lot to look at and I spent probably an hour and a half walking around and taking everything in. I was even texting and sending pictures to a friend and a couple coworkers for their opinions and to see if they wanted me to pick up anything for them. Walked out with a few pairs of Toms for myself and a coworker. Their prices on everything were good, much better than expected. I think the regular price of the Toms I bought were $3 less than other retailers plus I got them half price! I will definitely have to come back soon!

I bring my dog here twice a month and I love it. No appointment needed (unless you get them groomed which I do not) and for less than $20 I get her nails clipped and I wash her myself. They provide the supplies and I apply the elbow grease. It's much easier than washing her in my tub or sink at home. Additionally, the food that I get her is pricey, but it is no pricier at Wag 'n' Wash than it is anywhere else, online included. They have healthy, natural snacks that aren't full of additives and preservatives. I am part of their rewards program, so the 11th bag is free (she is 14 lbs, so it might be two years before I get a free bag) and you get discounts every $300 you spend. I don't know if it is always the same discount or not, but the discount I received was for 10% off my next purchase or a free wash. Staff is always super friendly and knowledgeable. I will be back this weekend to get the pooch's Freddy Krueger claws under control!

I really was not looking forward to coming here. The only reason I came was that I was invited by coworkers and I felt obligated to go since I turned down every prior invitation to hang out with them and didn't want to be "that guy". (To my coworkers reading this: I don't mean I wasn't look forward to hanging out with YOU, I just meant I wasn't looking forward to hanging out at Tilted Kilt. So calm down Bart) So, maybe I'm not good in math, but I would have thought that the equation: Sexy waitresses in skimpy clothes(North Scottsdale location + cheap drinks) = douche bag central I am very happy to report that I was sadly mistaken. The bar was crowded, but not too crowded.  I could still easily walk around without side stepping or "politely" elbowing people to move them out of my way! The music was loud enough to easily here, yet still quiet enough that I didn't have to shout to the person next to me. The waitresses were all really friendly and attentive. The crowd was laid back and drama free. My BIG mug of Blue Moon was like $6. It was definitely good times! I look forward to a return visit.

I didn't expect much from a mall food court cajun restaurant. I tried a sample of the Bourbon Chicken and it was incredibly good. So I got that and the cajun shrimp and garlic noodles.  The  Bourbon chicken was nothing like the sample I had just tried even though they got it from the same dish. The one I tried was full of flavor, moist and plump. What I was served was small over cooked pieced of chicken that were bland.  Now regarding the shrimp, maybe this is was how it was supposed to be and I just did not know it, but I did not expect to bite into a FRIED piece of shrimp with the shell and legs still on! Thats right they breaded over the shell. You had to peel the breading off so you could take the shell off.  What a friggin mess. Now I will admit that the shrimp and breading were rather tasty, but so not worth the effort and mess.  Now the noodles. mushy, sticky flavorless. need I say more? Wont be back to this place ever

I recently bought my brother's car from him. While the car itself is in great shape, he wasn't the best at keeping it clean. It was quite gross inside actually. The day I bought it I put my Blackberry in the cup holder for a few minutes and had to wiggle it out to get it unstuck and then scrub the phone to get the grime off. When I lifted up the drivers side floor mat there was like an inch of sunflower seeds underneath. I went to work with white dog hair on me one day (my dog is black). So I took it to Francis and Sons and had the works done to it. The ultimate car wash, interior completely shampooed, some sort of clay thing done to my paint, scratches buffed out, and a wax and clear coat paint sealant thing (and yes those are the technical terms ;-) Sales Person to me: Ok, that will be $320 (keep in mind I have an SUV) Me: Yeah I was really looking to only spend half. Sales Person: Ok, I can't quite do half, how about $175 Me: Done! They did the work quickly, the car looked great, and better yet, it SMELLED great too! Very happy.

I went back today and got the works done again. They do a good job and it's nice that I can get my car washed/detailed, gas tank filled and an oil change all in one place (and I even got a 10cent/gallon discount!) I definitely agree with Tony S. about the unfinished details. I had to re-wipe down the  plastic covering in the dash over the spedometer area behind the steering wheel.  Also, I had a scuff in my pant that I asked to be buffed out. To mark it, the guy checking me in circled it with what appeared to be a white crayon, the same thing he wrote on my windows with. No big deal, they did the same thing last time I brought my car in. Well when I went to pick up my car, I could still see the circle that was made on my car. Upon closer inspection it didn't seem it just wasn't buffed out, it was scratched. I don't know how they missed it, I noticed it from 10 feet away. They were very nice and apologetic about it and got it out. They had to buff it about 6 times and put some sort of coating or sealant on it. It's gone now thankfully. But with as blatant and noticeable as it was from 10 ft away, I don't know how it was ever missed. And they really need to tone down the hardcore upsales. It's ridiculous. And it doesn't end when you leave. Its so hard core that 40 min after I left I was being called because they thought I should have my air filter and differential fluids changed - for an extra $60)

Now this LA Fitness is nice! It's one of their newer locations, clean, doesn't smell like a locker room. One of the things I really like about this location is that I don't feel intimidated to come here like I have at other gyms (*coughs* Gold's Gym *coughs*) The staff has always been friendly, I don't feel like the other gym members are mocking me as I try to work out.  I do wish they had a bigger time frame of classes, especially on weekends. The only one I like better than this is the one at 83rd and Union Hills

I just moved to an apartment complex that apparently has an exclusive contract with Cox. I didn't find this out until after I had lived there a week and and went through several managers at Century Link, who happens to suck even more than Cox, just FYI. Anyway, after being without internet for a week, I called Cox, signed up, paid a tiny deposit ($25, seriously at that low of a cost, what's the point??). I was offered to use my own modem (which I did not have), buy one from Cox (which was not a modem/router combo) or buy one on my own. As Best Buy had a modem/router combo for only $20 more than the Cox modem, I opted to buy my own. I also requested free professional installation and they had a special advertised all over their website for first month free, which was confirmed by the rep on the phone. After I complained about the sky high prices ($57/mo for internet only??) they gave me the first 6 mos for $29.99 A tech was scheduled to come do the install at 5pm the next day. I went to Best Buy, bought my modem called Cox back and asked if I bought my own modem cant I install it myself the rep said yes that she would set that up for me and hung up. No further details. I called back spoke to someone else who said I couldn't do it right away but that I could do it the following morning and gave me the steps I needed to do a self install. Well the next morning I couldn't get it to work, called Cox and they said I would have to do a professional install but couldn't get anyone out for 4 more days. Had anyone told me this might happen I would have just kept the pro install appointment. So finally I get internet in my apartment. I have 15mbps, which is not their fastest speed, but it is double the speed of what Century Link offers, and its slow as crap! I had previously had Century Link and had no issues being on multiple websites at once while downloading music or videos simultaneously. Now I could barely browse a single website much less stream Netflix movies through my Apple TV/ It took 6 calls to tech support and multiple requests to have a tech sent out before I was finally able to get a tech scheduled to come out. So the appointment is for 3 days after my last call to tech support (which is about 4 days after having the pro installation done). Two guys come out and are in my apartment for 10 minutes. I needed new cable jacks (sorry if that is the wrong terminology) They change em out and leave and now FINALLY have internet working like it is supposed to. So now everything is finally working, and what do I get in the mail after just a week of service?? A bill. This should be fun trying to get this resolved.

I was very excited to come here for my first visit with a few friends this past Sunday. It also made me a little nervous though because I was afraid I would be let down as I was expecting too much. Well I definitely was NOT let down!  I got there about 5 min before they opened. I was actually afraid it was closed, no cars in the parking lot, no sign of life inside, but I tried the door and walked in. The manager greeted me explaining the bar was open but kitchen wasn't open until 5.  I was fine with drinking for an hour to pass the time! So my friends and I sat at the kitchen bar. I highly recommend sitting here (room for 4). The Chef, Cole, is a friggin riot. I don't think I've laughed so hard in a long time. He made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant. It was a great feeling. We got to try an amazing cheese pizza he made as well as some focaccia (sp?) with carmelized onions and celery and goat cheese.  IN. CRE. DI. BLE! For my entree I had the Pot Roast. It was very good. I have to admit though, it wasn't great. I sampled the pork chop and the stew and both of those were awesome. The dessert has to have been my favorite part of the meal. After eating at Hula's the night before, you would have thought I would learn not to share! That was not the case. It made me sad. So for the ambiance I give a strong 5 stars. Appetizers = 5 stars Entrees = 4.9 stars Dessert = 5 stars Service = 4.25 stars (Chef Cole was awesome, the manager was awesome and came and talked to us as we were leaving, but our server was a bit dull. She was good at getting our food to us quickly and drinks refilled promptly, she just wasn't personable at all.) Overall a great experience and I am rounding up to a perfect 5 star rating.

I've been back a couple times since and has had a great experience each time. Rumor has it that Chef Cole left :-( He is what really made my first visit so memorable! Anyway, it is still great without him. Last time I was there for brunch, my friends and I split the brick oven backed cinnamon roll. It's only $5 and MASSIVE. Ssoooo good! Tons of gooey caramel, golden raisins, kinda doughy in the middle. It's amazing. I was only planning on having a single drink but that didn't happen. Our server talked me into something summery and refreshing. I had something with vodka and cucumber and bit of lime in it. Well, I had three of those. They were so good! The Prickly Ricky is really good too! This place is quickly becoming a staple.

I had previoulsy reserved a car for a weekend here with no real issue. They picked me up at my work right on time with no mention of distance from my work to their office location (4.77 miles) Though there is one or two locations closer to my work, this one isn't far, and is close to my home (exactly 2 miles), and has better prices since it is slightly further away from the airport than other options. While in the car I had rented, I was pulled over, though not sighted, for expired tags (this is the second time this has happened in a car rented from Enterprise, though the first from a location in Los Angeles). The employee that assisted me upon returning my car credited me for a day for the hassle. Based on this experience, I would have given a 4 star, maybe even 5 star review. This last time I used them is why it is a one star review. I again made a reservation and called to confirm and requested a pick up. I provided the address and was told no problem. I also advised that I did not receive my reward points from my last rental and asked to be given the agreement number so I could request the points online. I was told no, I have to come into the office to do that. At 4:22pm I received a call saying they were on their way, perfect, I get off at 4:30. At 4:34 I get a second call, which I assumed was to tell me that they were ready for me, but no, it was another call telling me they were just leaving. So finally at 5 I arrive....AT A DIFFERENT OFFICE. My reservation had been transferred to another location without asking me, telling me or even checking with that office to see if they had any cars in the size I requested. I didn't know I had been transferred until I was half way there and asked where I was being taken (it was the opposit direction of where I was expecting to go). They did not have any economy cars, because they didn't know they needed to have one ready! I was informed they had a Ford Focus available but it was more expensive since it was a midsize with leather interior. I informed the person helping me that I made reservations for a specific price, I had called and confirmed a car would be available, I did not request the transfer, and it was August in Phoenix, if I had the choice I would NOT get a car with black leather interior. So after making me wait several minutes he came back and made it seem like he was doing me such a big favor by honoring the price I had on my reservation (that I had printed out and brought with me). So in the end, I got a car and at the price I wanted but the customer service and communication was definitely lacking. I may need to rethink where I rent cars from in the future.

So over the years, I have probably rented a car around 20 times, maybe more. So not a lot, butI've only ever rented from Enterprise. In the past year, I have rented cars from Enterprise three times, once from this location and twice from the location on 7th St. and Buckeye. I have returned all three cars to this location. The first time was great, no problems at pick up or return. They picked me up at wprk right when I scheduled and dropped me off at home without hassle. The second time, they switched my reservation to the location on 7th St and Buckeye without notifying me. I didn't know my reservation had been switched until I asked the driver where he was taking me! He explained, and apologized, explaining he just knew to pick me up he didn't know a switch had happened. So I get to Enterprise and the taxes/fees are slightly different and the car is slightly more expensive. They did give me a discount but I was still paying more than the reservation total was for. It was only a few dollars, but it's still frustrating! This last time, the pick up/rental process at the 7th St. location was fine, but it was the return experience at this location that was angering! I returned the car and was driven back home. I was in a hurry and wound up leaving my suitcase in the trunk. I realized my mistake within minutes of walking in my front door. I immediately called Enterprise and got an outgoing message stating they were closed. It was 12:40pm, they close at 1. I called and called hoping maybe it was just the default message when they were too busy to answer. I also called their customer service number. The rep at the call center argued with me that they closed at 10am on Saturdays. I told him no, I was literally just there, they're open to one. But no, he continued to argue and told me I would have to call them back on Monday because they were closed on Sunday.  Then gave up and decided to just transfer me there. And when I say "there" I mean just transferred me to a location he claimed was the 12th street location, but it was not. I called the 12th street location back and left a message. I've actually left three that day. Without yelling or cussing, ever, it was very clear that this bag was important, it was urgent I get it back and there was a clear sense of panic in my voice. Monday I called back and explained the situation. They rep I spoke with went (so he claimed) to check the cars and came back and told me that the bag wasn't there, but that they had rented over 20 cars since Sunday morning, a day I was told they were closed. I asked why, if they were open Sunday, no one had returned my messages However, the car that I was driven home in, the one I left the suitcase in, was not the same car I had rented.

I came here with two friends. It was my first ever massage and I was quite excited. Everything was top notch. We were each called a day in advance to confirm our appointments (actually one of my friends made the appoints for everyone so the same person called her 3 times in less than ten minutes.) Once we got there we were greeted and given paperwork to complete. We each had an interview and answered the questions we were asked and were explained the process. My masseuse was great, perfect amount of pressure. I felt like I was drunk afterwards. It was great! I even signed up for a membership! Can't wait for my next appointment

I quite enjoy this place! I work right behind it so I go here alot. I mean really ALOT. Since September I have received 3 free sandwhiches! (Buy 9 get the 10th free) The King of Queens and the Bronx Barbecue (without butter) are my absolute favorites, but everything I have tried there is really good! It could be $1 or so cheaper per sandwich.  Its always dead when I go there though, I hope Jimmy John's doesn't put them out of business! (there's a new jimmy johns opening in the old quiznos space in the building right next to Gandolfo's)

I've been here probably a hundred times. I love it here. With only one exception in the many times I've been here, the service has always great regardless of who our server is. The food is always consistently good, I've tried probably half the menu and have yet to experience something that wasn't enjoyable. I think what really prompted me to write this review (though it's been a long time coming) is that I was working late one night when I saw that the chef had posted a description of that night's special on Facebook. They do it all the time (I assume daily) but this dish really caught my eye. It was an Asian inspired dish which is a bit different than usual. It had chicken meatballs, noodles, veggies and a sweet and spicy broth. I called to order it for take-out and the person on the phone taking my order told me she would have to check if that dish was available for take out since it was soup. She puts me on hold and a minute or two later and Chef Jason himself gets on the phone with me to tell me how he is going to package the dish (noodles/veggies/meatballs in one container and broth in another container) and explains he's doing it that way to keep it from getting soggy and making a mess on the drive home. He even told me how to prepare it when I got home. I loved that he took that extra minute and gave me personal attention that I didn't request or even know I needed. It was that extra care and attention that really set Switch apart from it's competitors.

Their burgers are great but I've never been one to go out of my way for one. I get the double double with cheese protein AND animal style. YUM! Now, I normally wouldn't review a chain like this but I was so impressed the last time we went I had to share. There was 5 of us, all ordering something just SLIGHTLY different than anyone else, all different drinks and sizes, some combo meals some just the burger, some protein style others just animal or (like mine) both. It was a Thursday and the line was long. LONG. I mean like really lllllllllllooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg. It was almost as long as when the chain first came to AZ. But they kept it moving quickly and got our order PERFECT. I just wish they'd do something about their fries already!

My second time here was a lot of fun. It started out a bit rocky though, but was quickly turned around. We walked in and immediately noticed how uncomfortable warm and stale the restaurant was. We were seated promptly by the friendly hostess and given our menus (which were promptly snatched away by my friend who decided to order for all of us). Now the recent is decent sized, and there were only 3 other tables occupied, but it took between 10 and 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by our server and another 5 before she took our drink orders. Or drinks were quickly brought to us and or appetizers then sushi came quickly after. The server was friendly and adjusted the air for us which made remarkable improvement on our comfort level. For appetizers we had the edamame, which was good, Can't really screw that up though (although I prefer mine cold). We also had the tempura sampler with onion, shrimp, potato, and sweet potato. All were tasty and perfectly cooked. The potato was my favorite. For sushi, we had the dragon roll, evil roll, and the play boy. All were wonderful, but the evil roll was by far my favorite and I loved the sauce it came drowned in. Could have had a bit more heat to it but it was soooo good!

I am an ex Neiman Marcus employee and a life long fan of the company. Maybe my years working there and in customer service in general have built my standards higher than any outlet can live up to. But seriously, whether its an outlet or the full line store, it still has the Neiman Marcus name attached to it. Is it too much to expect the basics of great customer service? Just the basics... Apparently it is. 10:45 AM, on a Thursday... Yeah that won't be the busiest of days, but is it really necessary to have only one cashier? And a slow one at that. There were 3 women in front of me each paying separately for a combined total of 7 items. I was in line for 18 minutes.  The cashier didn't have enough money in the register to give the woman immediately in front of me $14 change. She paid $40 cash for something that cost $26 and they couldn't give her change? Really?? Come one Neiman Marcus. Step it up.

I came here on a Friday night, reservations were at 8 but weren't really necessary. The places was crowded and lively, but not packed and obnoxious. We were seated right away and given water without having to ask and served bread, butter and a chile infused olive oil that was delicious. Our server was top-notch! She was friendly, personable and knew the menu like the back of her hand. Her wine suggestions were spot on and complimented the meal perfectly. I had the eggplant parmesan (which was more cheese than eggplant, but I am by no means complaining). The noodles were thick spaghetti noodles perfectly cooked (not quite al dente, but far from mushy). The sauce was flavorful and obviously homemade, just had no pizzazz. Wouldn't have minded a mild kick to it. For dessert I had the Italian Cheesecake. It had a hint of orange in it. While it was good, its definitely not the New York style cheesecake I have grown to love. Italian cheesecake is lighter and fluffier as it's made with ricotta instead of cream cheese. It's not as sweet or as rich as I like, so it didn't seem quite dessert-y enough for me, by no fault of the chef at Aiello's. The evening was ended with an employee coming to our table with what appeared to be a vase. It was filled to ask us to choose a number from 1-99. If I chose the same number she picked, our entire meal, minus alcohol, would be comped. I have a liking for the numbers 3 and 7, for which I cannot explain. I picked number 37, she picked 73. No free meal for us, but it was a fun touch to the end of a great evening!

I've been to other Kabukis in town. The locations in Glendale and Peoria are all pretty much the same. They're nice inside but there's nothing special the chain. The presentation is always nice, the food is always decent and the service is always just so-so. Kabuki isn't a place I go to regularly, its a place I go to if it's convenient. I have only been to the Tempe location this one time, and while I normally would not review a place where I only ordered a drink, I feel compelled to review my experience here. I met up with some friends here the other night to get a drink before going to see Eat, Pray, Love. I walked in the door and was completely ignored by the host. I walked into the bar where my friends were and ordered a drink. The bartender was completely unfriendly. The only words he said to me was "Here you go" when he handed me my drink. That's it. He didn't even ask to take my order, he just walked up to us and stood there until I placed my drink order. A few minutes after he brought me my drink he brought out my friend's sushi roll and walked away. Just the roll. No soy sauce dish,  no wasabi, no ginger. He never came back except to drop off the bill. We paid and left.

Why is everyone else writing their reviews on the listing on Hanna?? Wrong address peeps! So I had been wanting to eat here for a while, but everytime I come to Westgate it was to meet friends at one of the big restaurants there. So I came here today on my own for lunch. It was pretty easy to figure out how to order (you pick a bag by number that corresponds to the category number on the menu then you choose your toppings) I got the Ruben with provolone and thousand island and I substituted the sauerkraut for  coleslaw and it came toasted. I also ordered the house chips which are homemade potato chips with salt and pepper. So I got my sandwich and was surprised at how small it was. It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to. So I ignored the size and dove in. WOW! The bread was so good. Toasted without being dry, light. The meat was perfectly cooked, not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place, the coleslaw was so good and flavorful, juicy without dripping all over the place. The chips were also really good! Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size. It was so good I can't wait to go back!

Not the normal type of place I would review, but I came here last night with a few friends to see Shutter Island.  At 9pm at night. On a Sunday. The theater was packed but it was opening weekend so that was to be expected. Now Shutter Island is (supposed to be) a creepy, scary movie. It has violence and full frontal male nudity. Why on earth would people bring their kids to see this?? That's right. Children.  No let me expand on that. Babies, toddlers. The kid next to me was maybe five at the oldest. Now, I have nothing against kids. I love them, want my own. My issue was really with their parents and theater staff. So kids are crying, talking loudly and the kid next to me threw his booster seat on the ground and was kicking it. It's noisy. Theater staff did nothing explaining that they were children and sometimes children make noise. Are you f-ing kidding me? That response is just unacceptable. I just paid $50 to sit in a grown up movie late at night and I want, no, I should be guaranteed the right to enjoy myself for those 2 hours. I know kids make noise. My niece is probably one of the noisiest kids ever and I love her to pieces, but if she's not behaving and she is interrupting other peoples peaceful enjoyment of whatever it is they're doing, then I don't allow that and I will take her outside until she calms down. Theater staff needs to realize that a complaint like mine was about noisy kids yes, but ultimately its the parents that need a speaking to.

We came to Belfiore after my niece's dance recital. There was 6 of us and only on other couple in the restaurant. That's right. One. There was one waitress helping both of us. To me, that seems to be easy. I would imagine most servers would say that having only 2 parties to wait on would be cake. Apparently not for our server. She took so long to take our drink orders that the hostess wound up getting our drinks. From the time we sat down, to the time we got our food was one hour and 23 minutes. Yup. 83 minutes. My lunch size portion of spaghetti and meatballs was a good size and it was really good (be careful, the chili flakes are hot!), but I was annoyed that my order of spaghetti and meatballS had only one meatball.  Just one! And not even a big one at that. Really people?? The bakery in front is quite good and it is the only thing that would bring me back to this place. Try the chocolate dipped cannolis!

It's a cool concept, conveyor belt sushi, but the service isn't as good as the sushi and the sushi is only mediocre at best. It's always crowded when I go, but they only seat people at the "bar" are where the conveyor belt is. Granted that's what most people are there for, but it seems there is a conveyor belt(s?) that go around the majority of the restaurant, but only the one around the bar is ever in use. Last time I was there,  someone in another party had to ask for a booth to be bussed after it sat there for 20 minutes untouched, my name got skipped on the list so 4 people that came in after us got seated before us. I said something to two different servers and was told "oh sorry, I don't know how you were skipped, you'll be next" before we actually got seated. The first time I went, I had a similar experience but thought it would be a fun place to take a friend. This second time proved that it's not worth going out of my way for

Meh. Maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here.  So one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it! It was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich.

I live right around the corner so I am here frequently. I've shopped at other F&Es as well both in Phoenix and Los Angeles and this one just isn't the same. Sure the product is, the layout is, but that's it. Today's experience was probably the worst I've had here in a while. Usually things are fine, I go in, get what I need, check out and go home. The employees are there but seemingly there just to take up space. Today however, it was very clear that I was inconveniencing them just by being in the store. They are out of plastic produce bags and when I asked them employee gives me attitude, doesn't say anything walks off. Another employee standing next to him said they were out but that he would get me a grocery bag. I finished my shopping and went to check out. I asked the very unfriendly employee at the registers if they had the Friends Card and was told they were out. I asked if they had any $25 gift cards, I was told they were out. I continued checking out and she begrudgingly bagged my groceries (without me asking, I would have rather done it myself. Um, ma'am, please don't bag my bottle of wine in the same bag as the tortilla chips.) and then walked off. Um, excuse me you just bagged 3 bottles of wine for me, do you think you could come over and authorize my purchase so I can leave? Ugh.

Carmax = BEST. CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE. EVER!!  Previously I tried to buy a car at Showcase Honda and gave the car back out of disgust and frustration.   When at Showcase Honda, I advised that I expected to leave with a full tank of gas. I was told they do not put a full tanks of gas in used cars. Carmax had me double check my car before leaving to make sure there was a full tank of gas.  Showcase Honda did not wash my car before I left. Carmax washed the carS BEFORE I TEST DROVE THEM. And then again before I took the car home.  Showcase Honda took 10 days to tell me that they had a different deal than originally discussed after I took the car home. And after that they changed the deal two more times before I finally gave the car back out of anger. Carmax took 10 MINUTES to run my credit, then let me review each offer that came in and let ME pick which offer I went with. Yes, I got to pick my own terms and finance company. And then the deal was done. Finalized.  Showcase Honda proudly displays that the average time to sign paperwork is THREE HOURS. It took just over two hours to complete. Carmax took 15 minutes for me to complete all the paperwork  Showcase Honda wanted 1 month of paystubs, a phone bill, bank statement and 10 references. Carmax wanted 1 paystub and proof of insurance. That's it!   Some of you may have seen two other reviews I wrote about Milano Motors in LA and Showcase Honda in Phoenix (both reviews are in my list titled Never Going Back) and know I have a knack for picking shady dealerships to buy cars from. Carmax is NOT one of those shady dealerships.  Carmax boasts the tagline "The way car buying should be". It is absolutely, positively true!  I worked with Gavin B. first, found a car I liked, was qualified in mere minutes. So easy! Though the car I was trading in was paid off, the title still showed a lien on it so I had to get a lien release before I could take the new car home.  When I came back, I worked with Rob. I wound up finding an even better car that I LOVED, and was slightly more expensive, and got re-qualified for the more expensive car in a matter of minutes. Signing the paperwork took 15 minutes. The car was washed and filled. The person I signed the paperwork was very thorough and kind.  I am so happy with my experience. I have no reason to ever shop elsewhere for a car. If I could give 10 stars, I would!

Walking up to Ronnie's Cafe I was thinking "Ugh this is going to be another hole in the wall diner grease-fest"  Walking in I changed my mind. I agree with Devin J.  "It may look like it was over-decorated by the kitschiest of grandmothers..." but it had a cozy charm to it. And it seemed most of the decore was for sale! The food may not be the healthiest but it was still really good and the servings are gynormous. The staff and even the patrons were all very friendly. Our waitress even gave my niece a hug and kiss on the cheek when she told her it was her 4th birthday. I had the Adam which is biscuits topped with carved ham and gravy and served with potatoes. SO SO SO GOOD! My dad had the chili omelet and was not happy with it. It was bland, no chili taste to it. It looked more like canned refried beans on it instead of chili, but of the four of us, he was the only one not happy with his food.

I loved it! I have heard good things about this place for a while now, but for some reason, never think to go there when I am trying to figure out dinner arrangments. The night we went, there was some concert going on at the little hall (I'm not really sure what it was exactly) across the street, so parking was scarce. The neighborhood that Tuck Shop is tucked away in is cute, and thankfully there were not many parking restrictions that we could see. We wound up having to park a little over a block away, so it wasn't too bad. When we got there, there were several people waiting (a party of two and a party of 12, so it looked a lot busier than it was), but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Both the host and our server were incredibly kind, funny and outgoing. They really made it feel like they knew you, like you had been there a thousand times before. We started with the Savory Simon Hand pies stuffed with sausage, kale and apple. They were amazing, though I didn't taste the slightest hint of apple. The chorizo stuffed medjool dates were incredible. Perfect amounts of sweet and spicy melded together. I could have madea meal of just the dates and hand pockets. The mac and cheese was really good, but from from being as special as the dates or hand pockets. We then split an entree. We had the Vovo's favorite which was cannolini stuffed with cheese and catfish and topped with more cheese and a green chili sauce. Wow! The flavors complimented eachother perfectly. It was wonderful.  It was an all around perfect dinner, from service, to wine to food. Can't wait to come back!

So I took Clarice W.s advise and had the Himalayan Hammer. WONDERFUL!! I've only been here once and really enjoyed it! I was with my 4yo niece and she ordered some hot chocolate and was VERY specific about how she wanted it when ordering and they made it PERFECT (I got to drink the last half).  It was nice inside. Modern, well decorated. Friendly service and good drinks. I will definitely be back. Free wi-fi BTW

So I have been here three other times since my last review. I've always had good experiences; good service and good food. This time was a bit different however. We showed up at 10:36am (I'm actually still here). There was one person in line in front of us. We placed our order a minute later. My dad ordered the breakfast buffet and was promptly told they stop service at 10:30. There was still plenty of food all still on display in the buffet line. He told the cashier he just wanted a couple pieces of sausage and some egg and would not be going up for seconds. She again told him no, they have stopped serving for nearly 10 min. Again, everything was still out and ready. So he got a yogurt parfait and iced tea. The yogurt parfait was pretty damn good. Probably best I have ever had. I ordered the Cafe Chau Chau which was good (but shouldn't take 13 minutes to make right?) So about another 7-10 minutes, right out on the floor, one of the employees is throwing away all the left over food from the breakfast buffet. Yes THROWING it away. And there was quite a bit food left over still. It didn't make sense that they would rather throw it all away rather than make a few extra bucks and serve one last person.

So it's kind of in an odd location. It's easy to find but not the place I would expect to find such great food.  I stopped by here a while back to try something new as I was tired of Carl's Jr and Jack In The Box. I wasn't expecting much, just need a change. I was very pleasantly surprised though! The people were friendly, and the food was good and was prepared quickly. I had the steak bomb sandwich. Wow! This would turn a vegetarian into a carnivore! It was so good! the meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the bread was fresh and had just the perfect amount of chewiness. I might have to go there for lunch today...

In lieu of exchanging Christmas gifts, my friend and I decided to go out for a great meal. Someplace new and something we normally wouldn't have thought to try. I remembered reading a review about Posh several months ago but I couldn't remember the name of the restaurant, where it was located...So a big thank you to Gabi M and Joel L. for setting me straight. I enjoy going out to eat with my friends, but never have I felt truly excited to try a restaurant that I have never been to. I was so excited that I was actually worried that I was going to be let down. I called yesterday to make reservations for today. I spoke with Josh (I'm not sure if it was Chef Joshua Herbert - owner) I knew from the minute he answered the phone that no matter what I thought about the food, the service was going to be out of this world. So finally the time comes and we make our way to the restaurant. We are greeted at the door by Chef Joshua. He greeted us, showed us to our seats, came and talked to us during our meal and walked us out. Some might consider it a little touch, but it made us feel special. Overall the service was out of this world amazing. Our drinks constantly being refilled, fresh silverware for each course...And, at each course, our server asked us how we enjoyed that selection. She did so in a way that made is seem like she was asking because she genuinely cared, not because she had to. We each ordered the 6 course meal ($80/person), sans wine. My only restriction; no olives! So here's what we had: Me: Amuse bouche - Champagne sorbet and cinnamon caviar   Course 1: Butternut Squash soup with beet puree  Course 2: Ahi tuna sashimi with watermelon radish, blood oranges with red and black tobiko caviar  Course 3: Loup de Mer (a buttery rich, silky white fish), buttered leeks, fingerling potatoes with a black garlic and mustard sauce  Course 4: Pork Tenderloin with chayote squash and braised broccolini in a bacon broth  Course 5: Quail with Duck sausage stuffing, asparagus and creamy polenta.  Course 6: Lemon something with spun sugar, berries and a green tea puree.  My friend: Amuse bouche - Champagne sorbet and cinnamon caviar   Course 1: Frisee salad with green apple, spicy macadamia nuts, goat cheese and hibiscus sauce.  Course 2: Course 2: Ahi tuna sashimi with watermelon radish, blood oranges with red and black tobiko caviar (same as mine)  Course 3: Shrimp with ramen noodles, leeks and goma sauce  Course 4: Wild Boar Bacon, glazed parsnips, pecans, chives and cumin sauce  Course 5: Venison with mesquite shallots, spelt and sour cherry puree  Course 6: Ginger pecan tartlets with a cranberry puree.  Everything I had was great. I have no complaints about anything I ate.  The ahi sashimi and Pork tenderloin were probably my favorites. I only wish there was something a bit more exotic.   My friend wasn't so lucky. She was very disappointed with the frisee salad. If you don't know what frisee is, its the lettuce you throw out when you open one of those prepacked salads from the grocery store. Also, her third course, she LOVED the shrimp (I thought they were slightly overcooked) but thought the noodles were ordinary at best.  With those few things aside, we both thoroughly enjoyed not just our meals but the overall experience. We sat at the bar as recommended by Chef Joshua and Joel L. It was fascinating to watch and I was very impressed at how well everyone worked together as a team. I kind of missed the interaction with the cooks. I was expecting the type of interaction that I experienced at St. Francis but did not get it.  I think this restaurant is a great concept and very well executed. It is pricey ($220 for two, with tip and 1 cocktail each, no wine) and not something I can afford to comeback to regularly, but I sure wish I could!

I've been here numerous times and it's been great everytime. I don't think I have had the same thing twice (with exception to the Banofee (sp?) Pie) Cornish Pasty is not a place a would come to if I was rushed for time at all as the food takes a while to prepare. Even though we may have to wait a bit longer for food than at other restaurants, every server I've had here has been attentive and friendly and eager to answer questions or make recommendations. I've sat at the bar and I've sat at the tables. The restaurant is always clean, I never stick to the floor or table, the food is good and freshly made, the servers have always been accomodating and the music is fun (and a rather ecclectic mix at that). It's a place I will come to again and again and always look forward to introducing friends and family to it. My parents love it and have been back twice since I brought them here a month ago.

I teetered between 3 and 4 stars and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I was just here recently but prior to my last visit I had not been there in YEARS. It was still Lily's last time I had been there (the Lily's sign is still out front below, and slighlty more noticeable, than the Fajardo's sign). We went on a Sunday. The chips were warm (but store bought) and the salsa was fresh and good! I ordered the pork chops and eggs. The pork chop wasn't grilled as I had expected, but instead had been cooked in a crock pot (i think). It just had a different flavor and texture that I wasn't expecting. My dad tried to order the cocido (not available) and then the albondigas (also not available). I don't remember what he wound up ordering, but along with everyone else, we all agreed the food was good but not really mind blowing. We may be back but not before we go to La Perla's just around the corner. The service here is definitely worth mentioning though! I think thats what pushed me to give them four stars

Woohoo! As good as it gets! For what it is.  Now I had fun here. Great staff, The food was good bar food. Its not a 5 star restaurant and the food doesn't require preparation and planning by some Le Cordon Bleu trained chef. But its bar food and its bar food done right! I had a great time with friends here last night. We split some wings, a pizza and appetizer sampler. Everything came rather quickly and was very good. And cheap! Our waiter was great. Very funny and friendly. I was also very appreciative to our waiter for brewing me a fresh pot of coffee. Now we picked this location over the other one because this one never has a cover charge and as it was further away from ASU, we figured (correctly) that it would be perfect for a laid back night out.  Apparently I am getting too old to stay out as late as we did...

I came here yesterday before going to see the movie The Bounty hunter (quite enjoyable if you ask me, go see it!). I drank a Sniakebite (okay 2 really, but they're so good. Half Guinness, half cider) and we split the Corned Beef Tacos. The tacos sounded weird but came highly recommended by our server so we gave them a try. WOW! So full of flavor! The horesradish crema gave it the perfect kick. The tortilla had a slight crisp to it and the cabbage gave it a nice crunch.  Had our movie started 15 minutes later (okay, okay, I really mean if we got there on time) we probably would have ordered another plate....and more beer.

No major changes to report here. Tried the corned beef sliders this time and they were incredible. The cheddar ale soup on the other hand was just ok.

I came here with my family for Mother's Day Brunch. The place was busy but we had made reservations and got seated immediately. We had been here once before for another Sunday brunch back in December for my brother's birthday. Now the menu offered on that random Sunday back in December was the same exact menu offered on Mother's Day. Nothing was different. Well there was one difference. A rather sizeable difference. The cost. $20 for the brunch and champagne in December. $35 brunch + $5 champagne for Mother's Day. Yeah, nearly double the price for the same menu just because it was Mother's day and they know people will pay it. I would still come back here though, the food is really good and the restaurant is beautiful.

Okay, so Fez/Ticoz/Switch owner take note: Postino does modern/chic/classy/laid-back without it looking like Ikea threw up all over the restaurant.  So I had heard tons of good things about Postino and had been dying to go and never got the chance until just the other night. I was afraid that I had built it up too much in my head and would be greatly disappointed. I was also afraid that eating here would  require me to call my bank and ask for a credit limit increase so I could afford the bill. Postino definitely lived up to my expectations in every way EXCEPT for the fact that the prices were great! I had the half panini and soup meal. I ordered the Tuscan Tuna panini and the white bean and chicken soup FOR LESS THAN $10! Both were so good and flavorful. I wished I had ordered 2! The beer/wine list was great. I ordered whatever beer my friend had and it was really good. I had never heard of it before but he had tried while in Europe and was impressed they had this beer. (Sorry I don't remember what it was called...) The service was great! I loved our server, she was friendly, sweet, and just completely on her game! I want to go back for brunch  and I want to go back soon! Now I chose the $11-30 price range because although you can eat for under $10, you have to have some wine atleast  right? Maybe an appetizer?  Well I do!

I really liked this place! I was here a few weeks ago for the first time and have come back only once so far (but many more visits planned for the future). I first had the iced coffee (a Toddy if memory serves me correctly). It was really good. I had heard a lot about them, and being that I am not so much the coffee aficionado, I couldn't imagine how it would be THAT different. But it was! It smooth and tasty! I added a little cream sugar and cinnamon (I can't drink it just black). I ordered the large like I normally would at Starbucks, but this was like bucket size. The last time I went I took Amber W.'s advice and had the Soy Coconut Latte which is HEAVEN. It is good enough that I would drive out of my way every morning on the way to work just to have one! The red velvet cakes are to die for! I could use a little more frosting though. Everything in here is cute; the store, restaurant and coffee shop. I love the colors and decor. Just a fun place to come too with good drinks and baked goods. Next time I will have to have lunch here!

I ordered my regular Soy Coconut Latte - it wasn't the same. It was still good, but not as good as the countless times I had ordered it in the past.  Additionally, I had ordered the lemon burst cupcake which the cashier repeated back to me but never charged me for or gave me. Since I wasn't charged for it I decided it was a sign that I didn't need it!  I had come to do a little work on my laptop. I love my laptop but the battery life SUCKS and I had to sit somewhere with a nearby outlet. The table that I wanted to sit at was dirty. For the entire two hours I was there.  If this was my first, I would have given it 3 stars, but since I know this was all just a fluke, and that Luci's is better than this experience, I will give it 4.  But only 4 for this experience. It is still a 5 star coffee shop to me!

So I've only been here once, but DEFINITELY plan on coming back soon! I came to the Clarendon on NYE for their big party. I got to the hotel early I could enjoy dinner with a couple friends. I unfortunately got their a bit late so I missed the queso cicherone and guac which I heard were amazing. I had some sangria to drink and it was great. It was like drinking punch. We split some soft tacos which we intended to have as appetizers, but they were sssoooo good we ordered many more and had them as our meal.  We first ordered a few each of the pork belly, carnitas and carne asada tacos. They were so good but our favorite was definitely the carne asada. Perfectly seasoned and cooked they needed nothing more than a dab of their spiciest salsa for a little extra oomph. I could have eaten them all day, but alas we had some partying to do. Another important aspect to any meal is the quality of service and the service here was definitely great! I can't wait to come back

I love this place! The coffee shop itself has a lively, bright, open atmosphere.  I love coming here with some friends and talking and drinking or just coming with my laptop to catch up on some work while not being stuck in the house.  My favorite drink here is the Matador, but they are all good. And their drinks are served with homemade chocolate whipped cream. I would be a happy man just ordering a cupful of that!   With as busy as they always seem, I am surprised parking is so easy. Especially with all the great shops in the strip Lola's is in.  I can't wait to come back. I might have to being my laptop so I have reaon to stay a while which will give me a chance to order two drinks. The Matador and something new....

There's not a lot that I can really say about Dutch Brother's coffee. That's not by any means negative; their drinks are really quite good. Their menu is just rather limited. I was hoping they would have at least a small selection of pastries or even a yogurt and fruit parfait...okay, okay I know.  It's a drive through only coffee shop and a fruit parfait would not really be practical, but that doesn't keep me from wanting it any less! The most recent drink that I tried was the Annihilator which is a creamy coffee drink of mocha and macadamia nut. Being that it's June and I live in Phoenix, I got my drink iced. Like any other drink I tried it was the perfect strength and lacked any signs of bitterness. It was smooth and tasty and the drink to coffee ratio was perfect. It lasted a 20 mile drive to work and all the through till my first break with tasting watered down at all.

The food was great! My burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I had a side salad and the balsamic dressing was probably the best I've ever tasted. The wings were great. Moist, crunchy, and the sauce had a nice little kick to it. Our waitress was great. She was very friendly, made great recommendations and most importantly, kept our drinks filled! My only complaint was the decor.  As the name implies, everything was blue. The walls were all blue, every other window was tinted blue, so your food appeared to have a blue tint to it. It was a little off-putting.  They should rethink the blue and just have pops of blue with neutral walls and non-tinted windows. It would make the food more appealing to look at. I still give it 5 stars though!

I had never purchased anything from lululemon until earlier this year, mainly due to the price. Yes, their items are pricey, in fact yesterday I spent $130 on a t-shirt ($54) and shorts ($68). My thinking had always been, I am only wearing workout clothes to work out in, so about an hour a day a few times a week, so why spend a lot of money on them. My work out clothes had always come from Old Navy or Target. But there is a difference between clothes from those stores and clothes from lululemon. I'm not knocking Target or Old Navy, I still shop at both stores, and on the same token, I don't exclusively shop at lululemon, I can't afford. I may sound weird, or elitist or whatever, but their clothes are worth the price. The way they fit, they way they look, the way they feel. It's just better. Additionally, their service is better. Can you go to a store like Target or Old Navy and ask for suggestions on what to shirts to wear to run in that won't chafe under your arms, or what shorts to do yoga in that you don't have to worry about mooning someone when you're in downward dog? Most likely not, but if you do it's probably more luck of the draw, rather than proper training. I've been to this store several times as well as various other locations and the staff is always extremely friendly and knowledgeable. My questions have always been responded to with answers and suggestions and never an "I don't know". Another big plus is that alot of their clothing is nice enough to wear outside the gym or yoga studio with jeans or slacks, without looking like you either just came from , or are about to go to work out. Definitely a lulu customer for life

I loved this place! Sitting on the big patio by the fire-pit having drinks and eating a fantastic meal while watching the cars and lightrail train pass by. We started off each having the Tiki Bastard cocktail ($7 i think). It was like juice with a kick. Not too strong and definitely not too weak.  We splite the Abalone-style Calamari ($7) It was very good too, just very different than what I am used to. It came in flat strips stacked like we were supposed to play Jenga with it rather than eat it. It had a very light breading and was served with lime-ginger-cream sauce and soy glaze that was really really good! As my entree I had the steak sandwich ($13) and substituted the jack cheese that comes on the sandwich with blue cheese. I also ordered the sweet potato fries. The steak sandwich was INCREDIBLE! WOW! Perfectly grilled as ordered - medium. As its pieces of steak instead of a full steak there was no pink but it was perfectly tender. I think anything above medium would have been chewy. Now what the menu doesn't list is that it is topped with grilled mushrooms. Yummy, creamy mushrooms. Now I am normally not a mushroom fan and have no idea what kind of mushrooms were on it but it was ssssooooo good! Great compliment to the steak and blue cheese. My only complaint about the steak sandwich was the blue cheese. While it was good and went extremely well with the steak, it was a bit too strong. Like tongue-tingling strong. Luckily it didn't overpower the other flavors in the sandwich. The sweet potato fries were good and the dip was great! Nothing more really to say there I guess. Overall I was very impressed and will be back soon. I definitely recommend this place to others. Oh, the service is great too!

Ok so I figured the true test of how good this place actually is, would be to come back with a friend who was born and raised in Hawaii. She loved it!  The drinks are dangerous! So good, I had to force myself not to have a third drink (I had to drive home to Peoria). We shared the Island Style Poke as an appetizer which was to die for. My friend said it was better than her own. I tried the Jawaiian Jerk Pork Plate which was great! Especially those little Johnny cakes! Yum! For dessert we shared this banana/coconut cream pie. So good! Its served on a bed (the crust that's not really a crust) of animal crackers and oreos. I wish I hadn't shared. I wish I remembered our servers name, but she was SUPERB! This place will definitely become a regular hang out for me.

I came back yet again with different friends (I am determined to force all of my friends to eat here atleast once!). My favorite server in the world Tia was there, however we were in a bit of a hurry to make our movie on time, I didn't see her AND there was limited seating as it was kid of busy, we just sat where the friendly hostess told us to. Our new server was almost as perfect as Tia. I hadn't been here in about four months and I was quite impressed that Tia was there and recognized and came over and talked to us. I peeked at the lunch menu and there was an item in there that wasn't on the regular menu. And of course that's what I wanted. I asked our server if instead of the Cajun Ahi Caesar Salad, if I could have the Cajun Shrimp Caesar  salad. She (and the kitchen staff) were very accommodating. I was once again a very happy camper.

I love seafood! So I was really looking forward to coming here. The crab dip was really quite good, but no one taste or saw any crab...just artichoke. But like I said, it was really good and we wound up ordering a second one (there was 6 of us) Entree portions were of good size, prices were kinda big, taste was average (except with what my mom had, I think it was the tri tip? WONDERFUL!), server was uninterested/uninteresting (service itself was good. Prompt.), nothing to write home about.  It's a more expensive, less tasty Red Lobster. But still good enough to be 2 stars. I would give it another chance. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item.

There store is huge and seems to have all the sporting goods you can think of. I had stopped by 2 weeks ago to look for running shoes. I was in hurry so I was hoping to go in quickly find a pair and be out of there. The store wasn't too busy and there were 2 or 3 employees in the shoe department. Now the shoe department was busier than the rest of the store. I look around for a couple minutes. Good selection, good prices. I find two pair of shoes I'm interested in trying on and grab them so I can have a sales associate grab them from the back. Stood there a minute, I was ignored. Tried flagging two associates down as they walked by; ignored. It's like I was invisible. I didn't have time to wait so I left. I came back again today, this time with more time to spend. I found 3 pairs of shoes to try one grabbed them stood around again and waited. Ignored even when I tried to wave someone down. I went and sat on a bench and tried some of the new Reebok RunTone shoes that were on display since these were one of only 3 or maybe 4 styles total that had a whole size run of the shoes to try on. I sat there on the bench, open box of shoes on the floor, my shoes on the floor, new ones on my feet and 3 display shoes on the bench next to me. I was never even so much as acknowledged. One employee walked briskly by me. I said "Excuse me, can you..." and he walked right by me to greet someone else. The guy he had greeted had a single pair of shoes in his hand. I had actually looked at them before choosing the 3 I was interested in trying and they were $30 cheaper than anything I wanted. So whats the deal? I had showered, was dressed well, my clothes were clean, I didn't have an screaming children with me. I know I don't look like I'm there to buy shoes for my next marathon or anything, but regardless, I'm there to buy shoes. I am there with money to spend.  Too bad these employees are either too useless or too stupid to realize that.

I loved everything about Modern Steak. I had actually planned on eating at the attached Modern Burger, but I was immediately drawn to Modern Steak once I peeked inside. It's beautiful.  Seariously. (Though I do have to say it was a bit on the warm side. To Modern Steak management, please note that in Phoenix, in April when its 87 degrees outside, it should not be cooler OUTSIDE than inside. Just sayin') The front of house staff was very friendly and guided me to the bar with no wait.  Though not the most outgoing, my server was prompt, polite and kept my drinks filled. I had the kobe burger with fries and their organic green tea and blood and sand martini. Everything was so good. Even the ketchup that came with the fries was good. I think it was homemade? The burger was full of flavor and nice n juicy. The bacon was the perfect thickness and nice and crispy. And that blood and sand martini? WOW! Sooooo good! And great presentation too. The martini was $11, but it was really more like 2 (ok maybe 1.75) for that price. My server poured it at my table, but she poured it from this pitcher that had like this compartment packed with ice so the portion that was left over stayed chilled. I actually want one of those pitchers for myself! The staff was all pleasant and INCREDIBLY good looking.  I did feel a bit under-dressed (well that is until a group of young men came in wearing jean shorts and wife beaters were seated on the patio) and I was wearing an untucked button down, jeans and sneakers. I have to come back soon because I want to be able to sit outside before it gets hot. And I think next time I will come with a group of people.

I come in here atleast once a week since it is on my way to work now.  There was even a week that I came in every day. Twice on one day. Ok, ok! Three times! I COULDN'T HELP IT! Don't judge me. I usually get either the Matador or the Cafe Caramel. I try to avoid the homemade espresso whipped cream like the plague but usually fail because it is ssoooo delicious. So delicious infact that I spell "so" with two S's and four O's. What I do succeed at is not buying an entire plate of whatever flavor short bread cookies they have that day Those are even better than the whipped cream, but as they charge for the cookies and not the whipped cream, I have to exhibit a little self control. I have a little better self control when my money is involved (but not much). Their poppy seed and strawberry muffins are amazing as is their quiche, but it's their short bread cookies that are life altering. Ok that may be a slight exaggeration, but I suspect it's laced with something addictive because I think about them ALL the time. I love the decore here. I want one of their (what I assume to be reclaimed) wood tables in my apartment. I also am in love with the work of the artist on exhibit this month. Usually I just look, but this time I might actually buy a piece or two. Really.  So now that I write this, I sit at work staring at the clock waiting for my time to go home so I can stop by for a drink and cookie. This is going to be the slowest afternoon. Ever. Oh and Nathan S., you better start checking in more. Your Dukedom is at stake and I want it!

OMG. I had low expectations of this place walking in. I had never heard of it and there were not many people there, but seriously, this place was great!! The milkshakes were awesome. We each had a different kind, I ordered the peanut butter. It was VERY peanut buttery and creamy and good! For my....dinner I guess (it was 2am, what is that, my 4th meal?) I had the mac and cheese which came highly recommended. I added tomato, ham and green chile. That was seriously the best mac and cheese EVER (sorry Grandma). It was good enough that I have thought about it every day since. Day dreaming of endless lakes pools and clouds of nothing but mac and cheese. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals as much as I did. The Navajo taco and carnivore burrito were big hits with my friends. I can't wait to go back.!

1:20 pm, I enter the Apple Store Me to Apple Genius Guy: My ipod isnt working right it keeps pausing on its own randomly.   Apple Genius Guy: Let me talk a look at it for you. (walks to the back, emerges shortly after) It's either the headphones or the headphone jack. Try new headphones first. Here's a free set.   Me: Thank you!  1:24 I left the store.  No more issues with my Ipod!  Can't get any better than that!

It was my second time here at this location and both times were great. I was on their website looking at new fits and I called this store and had the pleasure of talking to Andrew. He informed me of an event they were having and asked what styles and size I wear. I went in an hour later and was greeted by Andrew and Kate. Andrew had already pulled the two styles I requested in my size and in multiple washes.he grabbed me a beer and I looked around a bit more before moving to the fitting room. Both Kate and Andrew were friendly and attentive and eagerly offered their opinions when asked and weren't pushy at all. I walked out with a pair of their new Luxe Performance jeans and a button down.  Very happy customer!

This was my first trip to Culver's and it came highly recommended. At my friends suggestion, I tried the butter burger deluxe, fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called, but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard. The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double), the lettuce was crisp, tomatoes fresh, bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful! I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape, and full of salty cheesy goodness. The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces, but there was a mixup, but I had no complaints). I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I can't wait to go next time so I can try something new.  The thing I didn't like was the bible verses all over the walls. Seriously?? It's not that I am anti-religion or anything. I am Catholic, went to Brophy and go to church twice a year. I don't need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends. take a tip from In and Out. Put them on the under side of your cups. Work on your subtlety Culver's.

So does anyone else think the logo looks a bit like GameStop's? So you walk into this restaurant and are immediately enveloped by one of the best smells ever. My mouth was immediately watering and I went from being slightly hungry to starving in like 3 seconds flat. I had the half pound (which is BIG) BBQ, bacon burger with no substitutions and smashfries. The burger was really good. Like REALLY good. The crisp onion straws were very flavorful and the bun was delicious. I just wish the BBQ sauce had a bit of a kick to it.  The fries were good, however I think I would have enjoyed the regular french fries more.  Can't wait to come back!!!

I wish I could give 0 stars! We discovered this place from restaurant.com. They had $25 gift certificates for $2.00!! Though that should have been the first warning sign, My Big Fat Greek Restaurant had the same deal going on and we all love it there. There were so many warning signs once we got there! I wish we had listened. The only thing good about this place was the company I was with. We came here on a Saturday night at 7:15pm. It's located in the outer perimeter of Westgate City Center next to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant and Camarones. It's very easy to miss. In fact, I drove by it twice. I should have kept going.  You know when you're in a restaurant at Westgate on a Saturday and the restaurant is DEAD, there's probably a reason why. I honestly have nothing good to say about this place. NOTHING! Walking in, I quickly discovered it was probably about 85 degrees in the restaurant. Very uncomfortable if you ask me. Two of my friends ordered iced tea and quickly asked for another drink because the tea was gross. The salsa was Pace salsa.I like pace, I won't lie, but Pace doesn't fly at a Mexican(ish) restaurant. I can make them enough kick ass salsa to last all day in about 10-15 minutes flat. There was one other party there when we got there. It was my friends boss coincidentally. He went over and talked to them and they told him that the food sucked. We contemplated leaving right then and there but didn't unfortunately. I don't know why. Bad tea, Pace salsa, the ominous warning from the only other people in the restaurant... So we ordered, I got the La Torta con Al Pastor. The meat was well cooked but flavoreless. The bread was basically an oversized sesame bun.I only ate half. Not because I was full, but because I just didn't want anymore. My friend's chimichanga was completely unseasoned and my other friend made a couple comments about her salad not being any good. To meet the terms of our restaurant.com certificate, we all ordered dessert. One of my friends and I ordered cheesecake. Mine was still half frozen. The other couple shared a banana split (which was 5 scoops of vanilla ice cream, a banana, 3 cherries and a tiny bit of chocolate sauce) Now the review about the service.  Never once have I been so irritated of being forced to pay a gratuity. There was only 4 of us and we were charged an 18% gratuity. The service was slow, the waitress was not the least bit friendly or personable. She wasn't even slightly pleasant. It took her 15min to bring the handwritten bill and once we got it I went up to the bar to pay it after waiting 10 min. Never coming back here. We actually were guessing how much longer they would stay open. My guess is they will be closed by end of the year.

A coffee shop so new not only has it not been Yelped, but its not even on the company's website! So I came in today and ordered an iced Matcha green Tea There was no wait, it was almost completely dead despite the many people walking around Westgate. It took a while to get my drink. Normally I drink it like its water. In gulps. This was so bland and watered down, nearly flavorless. Water would have tasted better. I thought that maybe I just ordered the wrong drink, but, drink in hand, I stopped by two more shops on the way out then went and looked at an apartments complex I was considering moving to. I was asked at each place how it was and I responded the same way each time, "It's barely ok" I was told at each place that my response seems to be the general consensus.

I've been here a few times, whether just for drinks with friends before a coyotes game or for dinner with a mixed crowd of children and adults and each time the service has been great. I honestly didn't expect much, but I  am glad to say the Saddle ranch far exceeded my expectations! There's always a vastly mixed crowd. Men in suits and ties, women penis necklaces celebrating a bachelorette party, families, older, younger, frat boys and sorority chicks and every one seems to have a great time. While the food is really good, I will say its nothing earth shattering. It's all tasty and the portions are big. You can't really go wrong. Tryi the smores for dessert!

After eating at Jimmy John's in Chicago and Indianapolis, I was so excited they opened one here. Not just here in town, but like 15 feet from work!! It just opened this past week and I rushed over as soon as I could. I've been here twice now for lunch. The first time for a tuna sandwich the next time for the Club Lulu  The tuna was bland and I wouldn't have it again The turkey on the Lulu was nearly non existent but the sandwich was still decent. The lettuce was weird...had a weird texture, I don't quite no how to explain it.  I feel kind of let down by this Jimmy John's. Back to Gandolfo's it is! The bread was too chewy. Not quite stale

I really expected to like it here!! I just don't! isn't the same here, The bread is just meh. The shredded lettuce felt more like I was biting into shredded wax paper. I'm so over it! I've given it many chances, hoping the first time or so was just a fluke. but it wasn't. So sad :-(

So I am only 96.27% positive that I have been to a 5 Guys in Carson, CA (South of Los Angeles, by the Ikea) So, I've read some of the other reviews, and I totally get the VISUAL comparisons to In and Out, but that's it really.  The fries are a million times better!  The burgers were thicker and juicier and so flavorful! The bacon was great, the bbq sauce was tasty, the grilled onions were great, good texture not as grilled and mushy as In and Out. I think my sandwich would have been better with Cheddar rather than American cheese. The American was a little too salty for my taste, but it was still a great burger! I do have to say though, it is a bit pricey. I paid $12 for a bacon cheese burger, fries and a large drink. That's not much cheaper than Delux or Fez, and more expensive than Smash Burger. Can't wait for a second (or is it third?) visit!

I've been here twice and the food was great both times. The first time I was here it was tapas night. My friend and I split 4 items and loved each one. I came back a few nights ago and was able to enjoy their regular menu. We split the prosciutto wrapped stuffed mushrooms and I had the Chorizo manchego risotto. It was amazing. The chorizo was so flavorful, and unlike most chorizos, was not greasy at all. Service here was always great.  It's a very tiny restaurant so make reservations just in case (though I have never had to wait for a table, but better safe than sorry)

I love Picazzo's!  I came here at the recommendation of a family member who can't have Gluten. Now I knew little about this place, just that the food was very good and they had at least a few gluten free items on the menu. The restaurant is very nice. It's welcoming, comfortable, calm. Their concept is: Organic, Natural, Gluten-Free, preservative and hormone free and they buy locally. I was expecting a hefty pricetag, but was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, this is no cheap-eats type of place, but I felt I got what I paid for. I came with a friend who had been here before . We ordered the baked wings with BBQ Chipotle sauce and Meat-Za Balls as appetizers and shared a small Vortex pizza with Picazzo's original crust for dinner and Eve's Temptation for dessert. Everything was so good! Very flavorful and fresh tasting. The wings were perfect being baked, not fried. It was nice to have the wings drenched and sitting in a pool of sauce and grease. I especially loved the crunchiness of the crust. The food was great, our waitress was spectacular. My only complaint was that we ordered the Organic Garlic and Brie plate and several minutes later were told they were out of brie then at dessert we were told they were out of the brownie. Ggrrrr!! Even though they were out of two things we really wanted, we were both very happy with what we were able to order.

I work right across the street and came here for lunch the other day. I wasn't really sure what to expect. The restaurant was brand new and I didn't know anyone who had been there before but I figured I would give it a shot. I went in. There was one customer in the restaurant and one employee at the counter. The restaurant was simply but well decorated and was kept very clean. I and asked for a recommendation. It was suggested that I try one of the rice bowls. I went with the pork since I was told it was spicy. While I waited for my bbq pork bowl I helped myself to a serving of sauteed eggplant and some grilled potatoes. The eggplant was sssooo good! Very flavorful with a nice spicy kick to it. The potatoes on the other hand were perfectly cooked, but a bit oily and bland. My meal came just a few moments later. The rice was perfectly cooked. Not mushy or dry at all. The pork had been grilled in a slightly spicy bbq sauce. It was very good as well. There wasn't much depth or layers in the flavor of the pork or the sauce. It was simple and it was delicious. I ordered the regular and it was the perfect size. I might order the large next time so I can take leftovers home for dinner. I think next time I go, I will see if I can get half rice, half steamed veggies instead.  this place might become a new regular lunch spot for me. It was quick, very good and affordable. My regular sized pork bowl, large drink and eggplant and potatoes cost me around $7.50.

I have heard many good things about Bliss/reBar from my friends and family. So many in fact that when Groupon featured a half-priced "Groupon" I got TWO!  So I went to use one of the Groupons last night. It was a Saturday night, I expected it to be busy and I expected a wait because I hadn't made reservations. I got one, but not the other.  I walked in and immediately noticed how empty it was. No one was inside reBar, but there were a few people at the patio bar and one party at a table near the patio bar. On the Bliss side there were two tables occupied and three to four tables that were clean and empty.  Upon walking up to the host he immediately greeted us and asked if we had reservations. We told him we did not to which he replied "Oh, um well we really require reservations on the weekend, and tonight we are completely booked solid until the next table leaves, But let me check around and see what we can do." Really?? You're booked solid until the next table leaves?? Yeah that's how it usually works guy. I'm not sharing a table with a bunch of people I have never met before. Oh and by the way, stop acting like this restaurant is in NYC or LA.  So we wait a few minutes and told us "Yeah it will about 20 minutes but you can sit in bar. You can even order in the bar if you want, but I know most people who come here want to eat on the other side because they want that restaurant experience."  Ok, dude, I've been to a restaurant before. I know what the "restaurant experience" is all about.  I mean should I have been offended? We were well dressed. Groomed. I don't think we looked like cavemen....  So we went inside ReBar and ordered some drinks. I liked the decor, simple yet funky. It just seemed so empty (as did both patios). Granted I hate when restaurants are cramped tight with tables, but they could easily fit twice the amount of tables and still have plenty of room. The bartender was great. Very friendly and worked fast. The only thing that put me off a bit was when she complained about how busy they had been because of all the Groupons and how no one was really sure what to do with them. She made us our drinks and we sat down. Only one party came in the whole time we were in the bar. Fifteen minutes later the host came to let us know that a table would be ready in 5 min . So we went out and stood by the host station where no one was to be found. After another 5 minutes someone else greeted us. We told him we were waiting for a table and gave our name. he was friendly and sat us promptly  We shared an appetizer, each ordered the same entree and split dessert. As an appetizer we had the fried sausage ravioli which was really good but needed cheese. We each had the loaded macaroni. It was good, but there was something that was missing...it was lacking flavor. The chicken and bacon was good but the cheese was bland. It tasted a bit velveeta-y. For dessert we got rice pudding. It was really good, I just wished it had been served warm. Our waiter only checked in with us to take our orders, and then ask if we wanted the bill or dessert. I had to ask for a refill on my water.  The food was ok, the service was bad. I believe in second chances and I have another Groupon, so I'll be back. Maybe it will be different if I try a weekday lunch. I will make sure to make reservations though. *rolls eyes*

In recent trips (probably five or so) the food and service have been far above and beyond the expections my first visit had led me to have. It's a fun laid back restaurant and bar with good food and drinks, friendly service and great ambience. Its reasons like this that I rarely don't give a place a second chance. Everyone has an off night. Bliss ReBar must have been having one on my first visit. I'm glad it was just a fluke.

This is my third review. It has been close to two years since my last review, but I have been here 4-5 times since then. Since my last review the food has been consistently good, but the service consistently mediocre. After my last trip back in October, I would never come back. I was visiting with a friend on a weeknight. We had come for drinks and stayed close to two hours. About 45 min before closing, we stopped ordering from our server because he was so slow, instead opting to go to the inside bar to get drinks. The majority of the time we were there, we sat at one of the tables on the side patio, but towards the end, we were standing next to the same table and chairs. While we were talking, the owner (well, I am 97% sure he was the owner) walked by and without a word took my friends chair and walked off. I said to my friend, "Did he just take your chair?" The owner replied "Yes, we're closing." I apologized and said I didn't realize it was that late, are you closing right now? He responded that they closed in 30 minutes and walked off. It was the absolute rudest I've been treated before. Sorry, there are too many other really good restaurants with great service and all within a short distance for me to have to put up with his bougie attitude.

A couple friends and I came here during AZ Eats. It was a chance for us to get venture to something outside of our norm (Postino's or Switch). We made reservations and showed up right on time. The place was packed and we wound up waiting for about an hour before we got a table, but we got to sit at the bar and enjoy some great wine.  We each tried sometihng different and everything was great! Unique flavors, great presentation, great staff. We had a really wonderful dinner! My favorite part? The s'mores with bacon and peanut butter mouse. A-MAZ-ING

I'm not the biggest fan of Jimmy John's, at least here in Phoenix. I've been to locations in Indianapolis and Chicago and they're great, but there's something different about the restaurants here in Phoenix. It's really the bread. Its almost like I'm biting into a sandwich without first taking off the paper they wrap it in. That and they put A LOT of lettuce on their sandwiches. It's like a salad between two slices of bread. Anyway, based on the food, I would give this restaurant 2, maybe 3 stars, but the service sucks! I went in once to order a sandwich to go.It seemed both people I had any interaction with were annoyed with each other and it just made being there kind of awkward. You could definitely cut the tension with a knife. Now on the weekends I work in a store by myself all day. Wanting to having soething different rather than my usual meal from Windsor I decided to have something from Jimmy John's delivered. Jimmy John's is at 16th St and Camelback and my store is on Central just north of Camelback. According to Mapquest and Google Maps (I checked both just to verify), it is 1.9 miles, or 4 minutes in regular traffic. After trying to order online and getting an error message that I was outside of their delivery area. I figured with as close as I was, this must be an error. So I called and to the most unpleasant woman ever. I explained that I wanted to place an order but that I received the error message that I was out of the area. She snaps at me "What?" and I repeat myself to which she snaps back "What do you mean?" By this time I'm annoyed and tell her "I am repeating to you what the message said online when I tried to order. What part is unclear to you" To which she, unsuccessfully, muffles the phone and yells to someone "ugh, I don't have time for this, you talk to this guy!" Two minutes later someone else gets on the phone and explains that they have a 1 mile radius delivery area. Seriously. I wound up walking 1/4 mile to Jersey Mike's. Much better food and friendlier service there anyway. Next time, I'll just go there and not waste my time at subpar places like Jimmy John's. Oh, by the way, another sandwich shop, Correleone's, which is next door will not only deliver to my work, they also deliver to my apartment which is a mile further away.

Love the GFM!  There is always a great selection of products from produce to dog food to peanut butter to spices. I need to go earlier to get a chance to eat at Uprooted before everything is sold out. I would definitely come more often if it wasn't so far away from me though.

While most of my family had been to the location on Central, this was my first visit to OSF. We were all up for going even though it was no one's first choice. Everyone wanted to go to California Pizza Kitchen or Buffalo Wild Wings. I wanted to come here because I had never been here before. Well the service was top-notch just like Lisa K. stated previously. This location was brand new and the staff seemed well trained and knowledgeable about the menu. Everyone was extremely friendly, personable and outgoing. The service made for a great experience. The prices are very reasonable considering the entrees come with tea or coffee (not soft drinks) and spumoni included. We ordered fried ravioli and cheese bread as appetizers. They both were delicious. My dad and I each ordered the Spaghetti Vesuvius which boasts a spicy and hearty combination or chicken, sausage and meatballs. The waiter even warned us that was very spicy. Not only was it not spicy, it didn't even have a slight kick to it.  The meat was used very sparingly in the sauce and the sauce was bland. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. I tried my nieces spaghetti and meatballs. It was good. Not great, not overly flavorful but it tasted fresh, not fresh out of a jar. Would I come back here? Yeah probably. It has a great atmosphere and is good for groups like the one I was in. I think it would be worth giving another chance to.

I had scheduled a lunch meeting with a healthcare provider in Wickenburg, which is way out of the delivery area with the company I usually use for catering. Due to the nature of the business, I always try to order healthier options like salads rather than pizzas. I had called a few different places I had found on Yelp! and they either didn't deliver, didn't speak English or were in a drugged haze and not able to comprehend my request. The last place I tried was Tastee Freez and Sundance Pizza (mostly because of the name to behonest with you). Well this was a big reminder not to judge a book by its cover. The lunch was on a Monday and I had started looking for restaurants on the Friday before. In a panic on Monday morning I had called another restaurant who did deliver but they weren't sure if they had enough time to prepare the order and would have someone call me back. Well it took well over an hour to get a call back but in that time I called Sundance Pizza. The person who took the order was professional, friendly, helped me in placing my order and describing their menu to me. He assured me that they had plenty of time to prepare the meal for 20 and have it delivered on time. I even requested some changes to my order to accomodate a couple of vegans that would be in attendance at lunch. The meal was delivered exactly as promised and everyone loved it!  My only complaint is that there is no online menu and they do not have the ability to email or fax a menu to me.

As I never expected a vegan restaurant (Green) to have the best hamburger I've tried, I felt the same about cheesecake. I almost didn't bother ordering it. I mean it's main ingredients are eggs and dairy. But this was delicious! Sweet but not too sweet, rich, creamy.... I've had cupcakes, Tsoynami's, cookies. It's all good. You can't go wrong regardless of what you order. I even had gluten free biscuits and gravy here. Just like mom makes!

I never once thought that one of the best burgers I've ever had would come from a vegan resturant, but it does. I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I've been to Green numerous times and while I've enjoyed many things on their menu, I keep going back for their "Big Wac", their version of the Big Mac, or "BBBQ Burger", their BBQ bacon burger. They're delicious! The texture and flavor is exactly that of the meat version of the items they represent. They have everything from healthy options that you would expect from a vegan resturant, to bar food style options like mock buffalo wings and chili cheese nachos. There really is nothing negative to say about this place. I can't even think of an "it might be better if...". This is definitely a must try! Make sure to hit up Nami right next door for coffee and dessert when you're done!

I'm surprised there are so few five star reviews. I absolutely loved it. It was inexpensive, there was a large selection of salads, sandwiches and paninis. My friend and I each got a small salad (I got the BBQ ranch chicken and she got something with berries, both were delicious) and a turkey pesto sandwich that we split.  Everything was delicious! Very flavorful, fresh, good portions. I will definitely be back soon!

I don't consider myself cheap or frugal, but there are things I am willing to pay an arm and a leg for and things that I am not. I have no problem going to nordstrom and spending $200-300 on a pair of good jeans as long as they're something that I know will last, are figure flattering (yes, guys worry about that too) and are something that I will wear a lot. Now I consider myself athletic and active, but typically, workout wear is not something I have spent a lot of money on. I have a few Under Armour pieces, but those were gifts. The work out pieces I have purchased for myself are all from Target or Walmart. That is until now. I had been in lululemon a few times and never made a purchase. Recently, my boss at job #1 had started raving about their clothes and how you "get what you pay for". So I finally went in with the intent to buy rather than just look. I had just signed up for a three month pass to a yoga studio by where I live (Central Phoenix) and explained to the sales person that I wanted something loose and light weight that I could do yoga and run in. She shows me a specific style short and shirt and explains the "four way stretch", which I thought was a bunch of b.s. that they tell people to make them think their stuff is so great blah blah blah. Well, it is not b.s. and their stuff really is great. I bought the shorts ($68) and the shirt ($64) after trying them on. Wow! They are beyond comfortable. They move with you and stretch everywhich way you do. Its almost like wearing nothing at all. My favorite things about them is they don't bunch in the crotch when I run and I don't have to worry about mooning the person behind me in yoga. I'm sure whoever is behind me is also thankful for that! In addition to the great clothes, the customer service provided by all three associates was phenomenal,  She explained the sizing (I normally wear a large shirt and 33 shorts, I had to get an XL shirt and 36 shorts) and told me the washing instructions without me asking. lululemon customer for life!

My letter to Wells Fargo:  Wells Fargo Attn: Branch Manager 3002 N Central Ave Phoenix, AZ, 85012  To Whom it May Concern,  I understand the customer is NOT always right. I understand that I am not now, nor will I ever be your best, most profitable customer. I don't make a lot of money, I am living paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet. I am trying to get back on my feet to where I can live without floating one bill to pay another. I have a Second Chance account and I am trying to do the best so I can transition to a regular account. But none of this means your employees have the right to treat me like a second class citizen. You have to understand that in customer service, when a customer has a good experience, they tell one to two people. When the customer has a great experience they tell 3 to 4 people. On the opposite end of the spectrum. When a customer has a bad experience, they tell 10 to 12 people and when they have a horrible experience, they take to social media where they are visible to hundreds or even thousands of people.  I am a relatively new customer to Wells Fargo. Since opening my accounts, I have been in several times for various transactions, usually depositing a paycheck (which are now direct deposited), and have really always received world-class service from your employees from the moment I would walk in, to the moment I left. Yesterday was a completely different story. I will start by apologizing, as I was out of line at the end of the transaction. I drove off and flipped the teller off. I strongly feel though, that my actions at the END of this transaction do NOT validate your employees' treatment of me at the BEGINNING of the transaction. I was in a great mood because I finally received my tuition assistance check for $3669.00 from Arizona State University where I am a student. I rushed over to make it to your branch before they closed. I went through the drive through, only wanting to deposit this check. My friend and I waited for 10 minutes. The teller never apologized for the wait or explained what the hold up was, she just left us waiting. I am still in a great mood at this point though. Finally she comes back and advises simply that my check is being held. I ask why and until what date. This is when the conversation goes downhill. She tells me it is on hold until Tuesday because I have a Second Chance Bank Account and the check is from Bank of America and if I don't like that, I can go next door to Bank of America.  Are you kidding me? Her first reaction is to tell me to take my business elsewhere?? Who does that?? She was so condescending and rude I was shocked. But I let it go and collected my ID, debit card and receipt. I noticed the receipt read the deposit was $3669 and that $3469 was being held. I pressed the call button and asked the teller about the $200 difference. She was clearly irritated with me at that point and tells me the entire amount is on hold as it clearly states on my receipt. I tell her its not clear on my receipt, that's why I am asking. She responds by telling me she is going to get her manager. What? Are you serious? Up to now, I have not talked back to her, I have not raised my voice, I have been completely respectful. The manager comes over. I try asking my questions again and she cuts me off saying as it clearly states on your receipt sir, the entire amount is being held. I say again, its not clear on my receipt. She again cuts me off and tells me its clear on my receipt. She cut me off and repeated herself 3 times. I was so furious I drove off and that is when I flipped her off. Again my apologies, but again, this does not validate how I was treated. I went into the branch as soon as they opened this morning and spoke with a manager. As soon as I told her I had gone through the drive through last night, she stopped me and said oh, "you're the guy that flipped off my employees?" and proceeds to lecture me as though I am a child and basically threatened to kick me out of the branch. Again, I had not raised my voice this entire time. She finally lets me explain what happened, and though she is verbally apologetic, it is clear she could absolutely care less. In fact, several times, she kept saying I don't know why they would have talked to you like that, I don't know what the circumstances were. There were no circumstances that I should have EVER been treated like that. Yes I flipped them off, but that was at the very end of the transaction as I was driving away. The manager never asked for my name or phone number, never said she would get back to me if she has other questions. She was just giving me lip service, and barely made any real effort at that. Normally I can forgive and forget, but these two interactions from three employees are unforgivable and I am now questioning my loyalty as a customer. What reason do I have to stay?  Sincerely,  Lucas R.

I love this place. I don't come here often, even though it is on my way to work, only because I never leave myself enough time in the morning. When I do come here, I think it's early enough that there are no groups of people, in fact I am usually the only one there, so the small size of the shop is a perk for me, rather than a drawback as was mentioned in a couple other reviews I read. The coffee is always great, as are their pastries. They don't usually have a big selection of pastries, which for me at least is also a perk rather than a drawback. Makes it much easier to make up my mind. The staff is always friendly, the owner is a great guy. I actually told the owner that Songbird was my favorite coffee shop and that while Phoenix magazine was taking votes for their Best of Phoenix issue recently that on most days, I voted for them three times each day.  That wasn't me just BS'ing the owner. When I told him that, I had no idea who he was. He was just a stranger giving me a Lyft.

I made reservations here for a work party I was planning for 35 people. I called and spoke with someone who advised she would have the chef call me back to confirm. He called me a day or two later and I told him what I was looking for and what the event was for. He advised he would seat us on the VIP, or raised, portion of the patio and that it would be the perfect size and he would waive the fees or food and beverage minimum. We had a bit of a miscommunication, which was my fault, that I didn't know about until I showed up at Kelly's the night of the party. I explained I wanted drinks and heavy appetizers like sliders, guacamole, ceviche, tuna tartar etc. Though I told him this, I never made it clear that I actually wanted to order that and have it ready when the guests arrived. The error was pointed out by our practice manager and Chef was VERY accomodating and quick to get the food started and served. Most of our guests didn't even realize there had been any sort of mix up. The rest of the staff, especially Sarah, handled our large group like pros. Our drinks came quick, orders were never mixed up and everyone was friendly and helpful, which isn't always the case with groups of this size. I can't wait to come back. Maybe a date night is in order soon!

The first time I was here was for a party of about 30 that I had planned. I had never been here before, or even heard of Kelly's. I just knew the area that we wanted to be in and used Yelp to find a place with good reviews. I called and made the reservations but was leary after talking to whomever answered the phone. Leary because anywhere else I had called had me speak with someone in catering, asked a bunch of questions and would email me a quote. This was nothing like that, but everything worked perfectly (you can read my initial review about that experience) I was recently tasked with planning another party, this time a birthday for my boyfriend. Kelly's was my first choice. I called and made reservations easily and was very excited to go there again.A few of us arrived about 10 minutes early, and they accomodated us by rushing to clear off the table that was reserved for us. As experienced the previous time, staff was friendly and service was great. Here are the reasons I lowered my review to four stars, rather than 5 again: 1. Most of us did not have utensils, napkins or plates by the time appetizers were served. 2. My boyfriends burger was very undercooked (medium, maybe even medium rare rather than well-done). He's kind of picky, but didn't notice right away (it was dark outside) but lost his appetite once he saw how pink and bloody the burger was. He told the server who offered to replace it but he declined. And still paid for it. In my opinion (and I've never worked food service so this may not be realistic) but if you're going to offer to make him a new burger, and he declines, why not  just not charge him for the burger instead? 3. Location of our table. We were on the patio at a table long enough for the 16 of us there. Our table was off to the front side of the patio near the entrance and is quite narrow. There would usually be enough room still for people to walk past us when everyone was seated, however there was some holiday decore out which took up a bit of space. Customers and staff still continued to use this walk way continuously bumping into us or making us move our chairs in while we ate. So all that said, had this been my first experience, I would have scored Kelly's with 3 stars. But here's what made a potential 3 star review, a 4 star review 1. Our server Sarah. She was the same server I had at the previous event. She is friendly, patient and knowledgable of the menu. 2. Our water glasses were never less than half full. 3. The food and drinks were brought out almost as quickly as they were ordered. 4. We asked for, and got, individual bills (you'll understand what a big deal this is for us if you saw my review of AMF Lanes). So all that, plus the experience of our previous visit increased my review from 3-4 stars. This is one of my new favorite restaurants, hands down.

One of my favorite places in town and it's walking distance from my apartment, which is a huge plus.  Food and service is consistently on point. I had always come for the pizza but recently ventured out and tried their salads and sandwiches. Crazy, I know. Everything I have tried was delicious. Never a complaint, and never wished I had ordered something else instead. They make their own wine coolers which are fun and tasty (and quite a bit stronger than the B&J crap you get at the grocery store. Its just a fun, hip restaurant with friendly staff and laid back atmosphere and I look forward to every visit here. In fact I have reservations for 10 for my birthday tonight!

It's not that often that I try a new place and love it so much I tell everyone I know all about it. Gadzooks is one of those places. Being a "foody" (self-described anyway), it's also not that often that I go to the same place multiple times over a short period of time. Gadzooks is also one of those places. As of last night, I have been there 5 times in two weeks. Maybe I'm forgetful or flakey or whatever the case maybe, but there are many times that I've tried something and loved it but by the time I get home I've forgotten about it. Not that I would call that meal forgettable, but because I am usually always on the go and  always thinking about what's next. This was not the case this time. I was texting my mom and boyfriend while I was stuffing my face, the next day at work I was telling everyone about how good everything was. I had wanted to try Gadzooks before it even opened. I knew nothing about it, just seemed interesting and fun. So I finally get to try it and everything was so tasty. I was definitely not disappointed! Everything just has so much flavor, and the perfect textures... What I was really impressed is that regardless of which meat or vegetarian option I got, or if I got red or green sauce (or both), or which of the three cheeses or 2 sauces I got, everything went so well together.You can't really make a mistake when building your enchilada (or tacos or whatever you get). It just all works. The staff has always been friendly and not afraid to give their two cents when asked. The prices are fair. I paid just over $9 last night for two enchiladas and two pumpkin cookies, I have not one complaint about Gadzooks and am already excited about my next visit!

Though I am neither a vegetarian nor gluten-intolerant, I do have family and friends that are. While neither of those specific family or friends were with me on this particular evening, the person in line infornt of me was gluten-intolerant and the person in line behind me was a vegetarian. I was very impressed how when they each explained their dietary restrictions to the person helping them that each staff member knew exactly what that customer could and could not have and explained their menu items and what was in each, down to which items were made with chicken stock (which I've noticed some people don't seem to realize that just because there are no chunks of meat in something, that if made with an animal stock is NOT vegetarian). It's nice to see a business properly and thoroughly train their employees about their food beyond the information needed to be provided the majority of its customer base. Gadzooks realizes that the majority is not the entire customer base and has accomodated those with other dietary needs with a place to go and eat at with the assurance that they are infact able to enjoy their food without fear that the person helping them gave them false information.

When trying something new, I have learned not have any expectations, positive or negative,  until I have experienced it for myself. Otherwise, I've either felt let down because I expected too much or I didn't let myself have a good time because I nit picked everything. Well for whatever reason I couldn't help but have high expectations of this place. Thankfully, it was one of the times where I was not let down! I came here around 9 one night recently. I had heard about the long waits, so I had held off for a while but finally broke down and dragged a friend with me after work one night. She parked on the street, I valeted. For as busy as it was, my friend said there was plenty of street parking, I just wasn't paying attention. There was several cars in front of me, but the line moved fast, and I only had to wait a couple minutes before it was whisked off by some kid who probably just got his license last week (not complaining about skill, he just looked barely old enough to drive). We walked right in and put our name on the list and had about a 30-45 min wait (which turned out to only be 25 min) so we walked to the bar ordered a couple drinks and went and sat in the adirondack chairs by the ping pong tables. We sat, talked, watched people playing ping pong and having a good time. The atmosphere was loud, fun, and happy. Once we received the text that our table was ready, the hostedss walked us to our table and introduced our server who was friendly and sweet. we asked for recommendations and wound up ordering some cheese and pickeled peppers to start which where delicious. For our entrees, I had the fish and chips and she had the corn canneloni. Wow! Seriously, some of the best fish and chips I have ever had. Light, buttery, flaky fish with flavorful, crunchy breading. My friends canneloni was delicious as well, I only tasted a bite (I was surprised I was allowed that much) so I can't go too in depth about its deliciousness, but I would definitely order it for myself next time. The portions were big, I took one piece of fish, half my fries and all my cole slaw home and she took almost half of her dish home. For pickeled peppers, cheese, fish and chips, canneloni and 4 glasses of wine, our bill was $68. I don't know what people are complaining about. I really don't. The prices are typical, the portions were good sizes, the drinks were big, the service was impeccable and valet is pretty standard for central and downtown Phoenix. I absolutely loved the Yard and can't wait to come back. All of you haters can go back to your suburban Olive Gardens and Applebees.

Holy crap. So I ran in Pat's Run yesterday as part of a group of about 30. Coming here was planned ahead of time and we had the whole top patio reserved for us. It was fun lots of good people, the weather was perfect, we were all high on endorphins. So we're there, everyone's hungry and eager to relax, have a drink and eat some good food. I was starving, like ready to gnaw my own arm off for a bit of protein. So we discover there is one server for our party and wait patiently for our orders to be taken. Finally it comes to our turn.  I'm not sure if I some how offended our server, or pissed her off, but she did not like me. I don't know why, I was sitting there talking with friends the whole time. I wasn't loud, wasn't complaining about anything, this was in fact the first interaction I had with her. We were all dressed the same so it's not like she could say my outfit offended her,  I just don't know what her deal was. She took the orders of the three people on my right, then the person directly across from me, and then the two people on my left and started to walk off. I said "excuse me" twice and was not acknowledged. Someone else at in the group I was sitting with had to physically tap her on the shoulder and tell her to take my order. She did not apologize or even ask what she could get me. She stood there and stared at me. I placed my order and she walked off. A  few of us went down to the bar and ordered drinks, and then drank them and then stood there and waited...and waited...and waited. About 45 minutes after we ordered we noticed that people that ordered after us were getting their food. The food looked really good too. Big sandwiches, big burritos, and big bowls, which is what I ordered. The bowl was served in one of those Chinese take out boxes and consisted of eggs, meat (bacon, ham or chorizo), potatoes, onions and peppers and were full to the brim. So finally our server comes around and takes our drink orders. Another 15 minutes go by AND WE GOT FOOD!!! Well, everyone I was sitting with got food. I did not. I had started to notice that the portions were getting smaller and smaller. So everyone starts to eat and our drinks come out. Again, everyone but mine.  Finally my food comes out after everyone I was with had finished their meals. 75 minutes after I ordered I finally had my food.The Chinese takeout box was less than half full and was getting cold. The bacon was limp and clumped together, the food was bland and tasteless. No salt and pepper, no flavor. Even the bacon was bland. THE BACON was bland! BACON! Ugh.I ate half. Still had no drink. By this point I was grumpy, hungry and defeated. I don't get it. I don't know what the deal was but  it is safe to say that I would never come back here.

This wasn't what I expected at all. With a name like Scratch, I was expecting a cute little bakery, not a French bistro (I'm not complaining, just stating my opinion). I came here on a whim. I didn't even realize it was open yet and as soon as I did I slammed on my brakes and cut across a lane of traffic to get there. (My apologies to the silver Dodge Charger that I cut off) I got there at 5 PM this past Tuesday and the place was absolutely dead. Other than the server/hostess/cashier person, I was the only one there. The server was very sweet, friendly, poite, went over the menu with me since I had never been there before. I ordered the Kobe-style Wageyu burger with fries, a chocolate mousse cake with strawberry puree on top and bought a bottle of blueberry/lavender jam. The burger and fries were really really good and reasonably priced. The dessert was delicious, but approximately $7.50. Was a bit on the pricey side. The jam is pretty awesome, but $8.50. Granted its a big jar, but I would like something half the size. Its all fresh, no preservatives, and living by myself, I'll probably only get through maybe half the jar before it goes bad. A jar half the size for $5 would be perfect.  Pros: Service, location, parking lot (in Downtown Phx, this is definitely a pro), great burgers, cute restaurant.  Cons: I could order the lunch burger which was a burger and salad, or the dinner which was a burger, salad and fries at a more expensive price. Well, I only wanted burger and fries. I had a salad for lunch and didn't want another salad. So I had to order the dinner (burger salad and fries) and she gave me extra fries instead of the salad. So I got a burger and a crap-load of fries. I didn't want a crap-load of fries. I wanted a normal size portion. So half the fries went in the trash after I was done. Just let me order a damn burger and fries without charging me extra (that goes for you too Fez) The bakery side - nothing was labeled, no names, descriptions or prices and I felt bad for asking the server to tell me what everything was. Sorry!! But I really didn't know what I wanted and I didn't want to go just with what looked pretty. The server handed me the menu and immediately listed the three things they didn't have. My first thought was no big deal, its a new restaurant, maybe they don't know what the demand for certain items would be. However, I was told they were out because those items weren't in season (escargot for starters). Well, if it's not in season, take it off the menu. Create seasonal menus so your servers don't have to constantly list the items that aren't available. As a customer I would much rather have the server tell me what they do have (like specials) than what they don't have. It sets a negative tone for the meal. Just my humble opinion.  So yes, my "cons" sections is long, but it was really an enjoyable experience. Good food, good service.  I will definitely be back. I want to hit them up for breakfast this weekend

By now, you've probably all seen what this place looks like either on the news, Yelp! or Instagram, and it truly is beautiful inside. I came with some family members for Happy Hour. I was offered a drink, but declined stating I was going to wait a bit for the rest of my party. Well the server took that to mean that I wasn't going to drink at all that night and routinely ignored me when taking everyone else's drink orders once they arrived. The food was decent. Nothing earth-shattering, inventive or innovative. The blended margarita was good, and the wine was tasty, but as my uncle said "just because the restaurant looked like a church doesn't mean they have to give us communion sized portions!" Will I come back? Yes, several friends want to try it out. Are there better options? Yes! I'm dying to get back to Gallo Blanco. Better tacos! And less expensive!

I've been excited about this place from the first time I saw they're "coming soon" sign in the window and was even more excited when I finally had a free moment to stop in and check them out earlier this week. I loved the restaurant! decor and ambiance was great, though not at all what I expected. I was expecting something far more casual. Kind of a order at the counter, it comes in a to go container and be done with it. No its very nice, decorated modern casual, cool. I sat at the bar, talked with the bartender a bit. I ordered the sausage sliders at his recommendation and they were delicious.  The reason for a four star review, rather than a five-star one is this: 1. Prices. Sliders (two small sausage sliders and a side salad) $10, glass of wine $8, piece of pie $4.50 (from Mamma Toledo's which is attached to the restaurant) and tip $6. Total bill for 1 person = $30. Did I enjoy myself? Yes, Would I have enjoyed myself even more if it was a few bucks cheaper? Definitely! Hot dogs from the food truck are $6. Here at Sit, Stay they are $8.50 and 9.50. (Yes I understand than in a brick and mortar restaurant, there is much more overhead costs, but I wasn't expecting such a big difference in price.) 2. Pie is on the menu but wasn't available. I had to go to Mamma Toledos to order my pie. As I said previously, it is part of the restaurant, so it's not like its inconvenient to get there or anything, but it means separate bill, separate tip. Just a minor inconvenience over all. Oh and it wasn't air conditioned.   Would I come here again? Absolutely! And probably frequently. It's in the perfect location for me, barely a block from the light rail. Though higher than I'd like, the prices won't deter me and I hope they don't deter you.

So three half filled bags and $100 later.... I came here the night of the grand opening and it was exactly what I expected. Chaotic. I almost got run over twice in the parking lot! No. I don't mean that it was chaotic in a negative way. There was just A LOT of people there. Inside and out. What I didn't expect was this: I came at the end of the day and the store had of course been busy from the moment they opened, yet the store was spotless. It was perfectly clean, no messes, spills, things out of place. It was perfect. The staff who I'm sure had all been rigorously worked from the time they clocked in were warm, friendly, smiling, eager to help, and surprisingly, for the first day, knowledgeable about the products and where they were located in the store. Now I do expect a lot from Whole Foods, but I also expected that for the first day at a brand new location that I would need to be a bit more lenient in my expectations. There was really no need to though. The staff all seemed like seasoned pros and it was much appreciated. I can't wait to go back, but will do so in a few weeks when it has calmed down and I don't have to worry about some yoga loving mom mowing me down in the parking lot on her way to grab some quinoa and kombucha for lunch. Namaste.

Great location for me! Nice, clean space. The drinks and food are really, REALLY good, the service is just kind of...cold? Today I had a little apple tartlet with cheddar in the crust! Delicious! The cayenne mocha had just the right amount of spiciness to make it perfect. I forget the name of the other drink that I tried, it was a mocha made with dark chocolate and orange. Amazing. The food is awesome, I've had the grilled cheese made with goat and cheddar cheeses (it's a must try combination) and the roasted beet salad, which is by far the best salad I've ever tried. The prices are in-line with everywhere else, specialty drinks $4-5, the grilled cheese was $6 and the salad was $10. The salad had the perfect beet to goat cheese ratio, but could have used quite a bit more lettuce. It was really an $8 salad. $2 more worth of lettuce next time please. I would probably five this place a 5 star rating based on food and beverage alone, but only 3 stars (still A-OK) for service. While everyone is nice, no one is really friendly. I sat at the bar the first time and no one talked to me  and my attempts at small talk were awkwardly avoided. The Refuge Cafe has a lot of positive things its doing, why not talk about it to their customers?

This is my favorite location of the four. I've been here numerous times and the service is always great, food is delicious and the crowd and outside area are really what makes me like this location. Get the cheesey tater tots! They're amazing

I'm having a tough time scoring this experience. I think had it not been barely a week old, I would have given this one star, but being so new, I am willing to give benefit of the doubt. So, and this completely makes sense, carts aren't allowed in the restaurant. I didn't think of that before hand. Next time I know to come here before I start my shopping. It seems the restaurant has a seat yourself concept. Not a big deal, right? Well, its not a big deal if the staff are paying attention to new people that come in. That way we don't have to flag someone down to bring them menus after sitting there for 15 minutes. Our food took a little over twenty minutes to get. We started by ordering a cheese platter, green chili cheese fries and pretzel bread with cheese dip, a glass of wine and a glass of tea.  About five minutes after ordering, my friend asked if she could order an additional item to go and asked that it be brought at the end of the meal and was told yes. So our food finally comes and it is all to go. The server acknoledged the mistake right away, but didn't make the effort to re-plate our items before serving us. Additionally we never got the fries, though we did get charged for them. After she took the fries off our bill, the total came to about $25.16 if I remember correctly. I gave my card and she took it to charge me. When she brought my card and the receipt back, she had charged me for a different ticket. Only a few cents higher ($25.87) but clearly not my receipt even though my card number was on it. We had had enough at this point and let it be. Annoying thing about the receipts is as they're not set up to require signatures on purchases under $50 so there is no place to sign which apparently also means no room to leave a tip (yes we tipped) so we were stuck paying a cash tip with all the money I had in my wallet ($2.65). Overall, it definitely was not the best service, far beneath what I would expect from Whole Foods, but I feel they deserve a second chance. Everyone has their off days. I will say I felt everything was very resonably priced and the prices were great! On Wednesdays the cheese plate and a glass of wine is $10 which means my $6 glass of wine was free!

K.I.S.S. = Keep It Simple Stupid And they do. They have wine. They have beer. The make grilled cheeses on a panini press. They have a rather wide variety of wine and beer, with new things coming in frequently. It's enough to keep the unadventurous happy and the adventurous excited to try something new and different. The bartenders know their product and they know their customers and they remember what you like and aren't afraid to make new suggestions and let you try things. They're fun and friendly and welcome everyone with a smile and a handshake. For a place that really only serves 3 things, I can't speak highly enough about it!

I practically live next door and have been eagerly awaiting for it to open. I came here today specifically as an end to my Small Business Saturday. There are all ready so many great places in Central and Downtown Phoenix, but they're all either Mexican, burgers and salads or pizza. This is such a welcome and refreshing change to that line-up. From the moment I entered to the moment I left, service was spot-on. It was friendly, personable, the staff was knowledgable, I couldn't  have asked for or expected better. The same with the food. It was seriously one of the best meals I have ever had. I started with a single steamed bun with duck. It was so good. I contemplated ordering 2-3 more and just making that my meal. Since it was my first time there, I figured I'd try something else for my entree though. I had the chicken katzu rice bowl. WOW! Such a unique flavor.  I cannot wait to go back and drag everyone I know with me.

So I was just there this morning (2/19/2010) and it is very much OPEN. Has been for years.  I came here because I have an external hard drive that seemed to have died. I first took it to Walmart where I bought it from and had purchased a replacement plan on it. That was a mistake. So I took it to Best Buy. They confirmed it was dead and said that they could see if the data could be salvaged.  YAY! It would take 2-4 weeks. BOO! And would cost $1600-2000. WTF?! So screw that brilliant idea. Determined, I headed off to Absolute Computers. They plugged it in, said it was a bad power cable. They gave me a used one showed me it worked. I was in and out in 5 minutes with a perfectly working hard drive. And I didn't have to spend a dime!

Such an awesome shop! I was excited a year ago to buy Baldwin and Imogene+Willie jeans because they were 100% made in the USA. Now Lawless Denim & Co comes to town and has me buying jeans that aren't just made in the U.S., they're made right here in downtown Phoenix! Nick was the denim smith on hand to help me out. He had me try on two pairs and I walked out with one. He was friendly and thorough, went over all the details as to where the fabric was from, the difference between getting them off the rack and the various options I had if I wanted a custom pair. That's right, they will custom fit you for your own jeans. I did not go with a custom pair, I bought off the rack. Off the rack jeans come un-hemmed, but they will hem them while you wait! No having to come back a week or two later! They store is really great, from the vintage sewing machines, a variety of products from shoes to belts to Bison Made (another local company doing big things) wallets and straight razors. I will be back, this time I'm thinking I need something custom!

I loved this place! I cane here with a friend and one of the employees greeted us and immediately insisted we sample all their meat selections. I did the green chile pork burrito which was fantastic. Might I even say better than Chipotle? Similar concept to Chipotle, but better all around. Great fun and funky decor. Music was interesting, it started out good then got weird. That's probably the only thing I would change... I marked this as good for kids, but be careful, many of the meats are spicy!!

I came here yesterday (obviously) for the first time. I did not check out the menu ahead of time so my expectations were slightly different than reality. Based on the name, I was expecting a late night restaurant (which it is) that serves upscale (which it does), bar food (which it does NOT). Well, let me clarify. There are bar food-y items on the menu (chicken wings, flatbread, fries, poutine, etc.), but it's not a bar food restaurant, if that makes sense. If I'm going to eat at 1AM after a night out, I'm probably drunk and want nachos, rather than a pan seared trout. Now this isn't necessarily a complaint (I mean, I'm giving it 5 stars still!). Moving on, we walked in and were greeted and seated right away. Our server was great, very friendly and enthusiastic and already knowledgeable about the menu. We started with a bottle of sauv blanc and the short ribs. The short ribs were not what we were expecting, but should have. The suggested wine pairing is a Korean Viognier and its parinaded in a soy marinade and comes with fresh kimchi on the side. Should we have expected Korean style short ribs? Probably. Did we? No. They were good, but per that cut, a bit tough and fatty. The kimchi was more like a coleslaw than kimchi. And for $14 for two thin slices of short rib, seemed very overpriced. My sandwich had beef cutlet, a fried egg and french fries with it for the same price. I had the milanesa sandwich and my friend had the chopped salad with chicken. We both thoroughly enjoyed out entrees. Overall the food was really good, great atmosphere and service as well.
