Great local shop! My dogs' nails look great and the staff was super nice! There's even a little chihuahua who stays in her perch watching over the shop!

Never, never, never going here again...  Hearing complaining about tips is a HUGE turn off in my book. Upon entering Autumn Court the server/bartender was complaining to a man sitting at the bar that the last customers that she served did not leave her a tip. (To be honest, I would have considered stiffing her too after these comments.) She then had the audacity to ask the customer if she should go out and ask them for one! This is all while we were waiting to be seated. The customer said "I wouldn't" and she made a dash for the side door heading to the parking lot. The customer turned to us and said he had never seen anything like that before. Wait...there's more. We turned around and left to find a different place to eat and I made a call to the manager to let him know what had happened. He listened, but offered no resolution and took my information to pass to the owner. Five minutes later my cell phone starts ringing and it is the server (seriously!?) we called about asking why we thought it was not right that she did that and told me that she had the RIGHT to tips because she was not paid hourly. I briefly spoke to her about the rudeness of speaking to customers about other customers and all she could say was that she would not get fired over this. Babe, if were my restaurant you would have totally have been gone for this. Tomorrow I'll try and contact the owner direct because we are never going there again and my phone number should not have been passed out like that. Time to find another neighborhood Chinese restaurant.

This is really a great place! Good coffee, reliable Wi-Fi and pastries galore! The staff is super friendly. Can't wait for it to be nice enough to enjoy working from there with the big roll-up door open!

Last week, my friend and I went to Z Pizza and had some great thin crust pizzas. She called in the order and asked about the crust being gluten free, which it is. (That was only for a FYI purpose, not because we wanted gluten free). When she placed the order the person let her know that something we got as a topping was not gluten free, which was totally OK with us. She got a call back later from another person letting her know the same info. That is a good customer service touch and we both wanted to give Z Pizza a shout out for taking care of their customers. Plus...their pizzas are really yummy!

Sorry, Jennifer'S. Stick to catering where you don't have a customer service component. A service based business should at least require staff to interact with customers. If your staff can glare at customers they can at least fill water glasses.

All I can say is AMAZING! If there were a 10 star option I would select it!!!! This place really cares about their customers (and the community)! Super-fast service. Delicious coffee! I'm proud to currently be their Foursquare mayor!

Wow...it looks like this place does not have many stars from other people...I didn't even look at reviews before writing mine. Tomorrow I'm going to try and track down the corporate office. Even one star is too much!  Patron's beware! McFadden's in Glendale, Arizona has hands-down one of the worst customer service policies ever! It is like this bar runs on a crew with their heads up each other's asses! Basically, this place SUCKS!!!   My experience was so terrible the only way to keep it together, without writing a book, was bullet points: * Attempted to organize an event for 20-15 employees. Had an office member contact the restaurant the week before to set it up. Relations person was more concerned with taking the credit card info to charge us if we did not show, or had less people, than sending the agreement. We never got anything in writing with these policies on it! Surprise, surprise...the only thing in the file was the credit card without a booked reservation. * Tried to call the location the day of the event to confirm. Was told by the hostess that I was not allowed to speak to a manager about this issue and she would not find someone for me to check the reservation. Called back with a different name and held for 14 minutes to speak to a manager that just said "Sarah" was off and would be coming in...Um, how is her staffing my issue? I had to badger her to even look into the issue. * Finally worked out the details and had tables reserved, the day of the event while my party was on the freeway going to the location. The first guests arrived after making our complaints to the manager and one of the bartenders made the remark "Those are some big shoes to fill" to our assigned server in front of guests. What, because we had to call to make sure we had a place to go? * The place smelled like vomit!! (Also noted in another customer's review) * Terrible, terrible, terrible service! Our server would only take one drink order at a time and often left the table without asking the customers with empty classes if they wanted another beverage. Hello...dumb ass...empty glasses means more opportunity to make more money?! Maybe the mandatory 18% tip for the party size blew our chances at having any sort of service.  * Drinks and food were sent to our table that we did not order. Food runners gave us attitude and stormed off when we told them the food did not belong to us. * Bill arrived with over $100 in extra charges for drinks we did not order were on it. We asked the server about it and her response was "Well, I am NOT taking them off" and walked off.  * Had to ask for another manager to come over because of the inflated bill. Took 20 minutes for him to get to us and the restaurant was not even busy. Manager was extremely patronizing and was not going to help us at first. After having to re-hash the details he took some of the drinks off, but not all of them. He claimed that the service "might" not have been that great because it was St. Patrick's Day that week. Didn't they have like 364 days to get ready for this?  * Waited another 30 minutes to get our change back. After coming back to the table the server put the bill and change in my face, glared at me and walked away. No "thank you" or anything for the 18% tip she was guaranteed because the size of the party. In all honesty, I would have totally stiffed her if it were a smaller party.  I was embarrassed that my group had to experience this. The only reason we decided to go there was one of my guests had won a happy-hour event there. My gut feeling when I could not confirm the reservation was to just go somewhere else, but was afraid that the only thing they would do correctly was charge the credit card for a no show. Knowing this I would have taken the group to Applebee's where we would have expected this. Our state relies on tourism and looking at the issue from a higher level the industry decline in does not rest only on the economy, but at these eateries internally. I am starting to point blame at the terrible customer in the service industry, weak and inexperienced restaurant/bar management, and shoddy company policies for their decline. If the industry truly cared about customers it would not be in this predicament.  Did anyone notice that their staff member was the only one to give this place like 5 stars? Maybe she should be a customer in it instead of part of the "family".

I love Urban Beans! It is probably one of the best coffee houses I have been to. The staff members are great and there is plenty of seating and lots of plugs for computers. The WiFi is very reliable! Can't wait for the weather to get a little warmer so I can have coffee on the patio!

Um...I might have an addiction! Every thing I have ever ordered there has been great! The owner is very cool and checks to make sure everything is perfect! She even brings us samples of new things to try and asks for our feedback! Love that! Can I just say...the #55 with peanut butter, Nutella, bananas and almonds...I die!

Holy mother of God, I think I've had my worst restaurant experience...ever! Tonight we decided to try out the new Spoke and Wheel restaurant. Their signage and billboards looked promising and my friends and I like to try new places. I almost didn't post this, but the longer I thought about it, the more aggravated I got. For the record...I really, really wanted to like this place.   Here's the rundown of my experience. Upon entering the restaurant I could tell there was something wrong. The parking lot was empty, along with a whole dining room, but there was a 20-minute wait for a table. Now, I may not own a restaurant, but I am pretty sure they make money by turning tables. The first round of drinks took almost 30 minutes to get to us (including water). Secondly, I was not able to order my burger the way I wanted because it was not the half-pound burger. What?! Another almost 30 minutes later our food is dropped off. I say "dropped off" because it was literally placed in front of us and that was it. While we ate, we started seeing guys going around the dining room and start taking tables and chairs outside. We watched and watched as they emptied the whole floor leaving the perimeter booths full (and not served) and isolated two tables of customers to the middle of the floor. Awkward! The whole time we watched them clear the floor we were never asked to have our drinks refilled, if our food was OK...nothing. When the server finally came back to the table after we had eaten, I asked what was going on to find out there was a big, reserved party being set up. My experience as a new customer, at a new restaurant, was cut short because they were too busy setting up for other customers? It just seemed to me they would have been better off having the host start seating the totally empty dining room earlier rather than keep filling the one that was going to be used for the party. As it came time to pay our check the slowness worsened. It took as long to pay the check as it did to order and eat our meal! After finally being able to pay I stopped at the front to see if I could get a card to speak to the owner. The owner was there and I explained that I thought it was a bit rude and classless to start emptying a dining room around customers because of improper management planning. It might have been a better idea to have the crew clearing the floor helping the servers getting customers cashed out BEFORE taking all the furniture out. All I got was the standard "let me make it up to you" response like I was going to come back. As I looked outside, I saw 4 busloads of 20-somethings in atrocious clothing surging the front door (which was now totally blocked by the crowd). Pretty sure that is a fire hazard. I didn't take the free meal we were going to get on principle alone. They can have their other customers who will accept that sort or service (and I blame for making this kind of thing acceptable) while I go other places more appreciative of my business. Like I wrote on my credit card draft "I AM NEVER COMING BACK"!

I find it extremely interesting the staff COMPLETELY changes when the "owner" shows up with his boyfriend. The whole bar shows a sign of terror when they walk in and stop serving customers. We went from getting drinks, to watching the staff start washing windows, sweeping, and giving us bar food when after they walked in. What this really shows is the "owner" runs this bar on a fear based management style and I imagine there will start to be a high turnover. Spend MORE time in your bar, speak to the people spending money in it, and less about how much you made that night. Yes, I watched YOU pull the nightly numbers, sit at a table, and let your staff serve you and your BF above the customers spending MONEY in your bar. My friends and I will spend our money in a different bar from now on...I am with Matt S. on his review. This was my second time there are I was disrespected as a customer TWICE!
