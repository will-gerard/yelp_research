I love the 5 & Diner! The staff is always friendly, I love the retro theme, and I thoroughly enjoy their house plate breakfast. This joint is always clean, serves food fast enough, and I haven't left here without a smile.

Awesome wings, good drinks, friendly staff, and never a long wait. This Zipp's is by far my favorite location.

Malee's is my go-to restaurant when I'm eating lunch in  Old Town. The staff is always friendly, and the food is fresh, tasty, and quick. Want something real spicy? Their chef-hot selection isn't for amateurs, they really add the heat!

I've lived at a few apartment complexes in my life, and Hayden Park puts all the rest to shame. Was my stay perfect? Nope, but what is in life? I don't value perfection, but I do value people who work hard to keep my satisfaction.   Folks, Dan and Daanan are the best in the industry. These guys were always quick to help with any issue that ever came up, and they always did it with a smile and a friendly demeanor. Same for the service guys. They were quick, efficient, and always helpful.  Why else should you live here? Hayden Park is located right in the middle of the fun part of Scottsdale. You can walk to great restaurants and bars. Old Town is an extremely cheap fare away. The neighbors? Quiet as a retirement home. Loved it!   Another awesome aspect is that HP has many options for apartments, including one-story residences.   So if you're sick of incompetent staff - or if you live in BFE and are tired of traveling to do anything fun, you should definitely check out Hayden Park for your next apartment home.

Tottie's is great if you are looking for some variety in your menu. The ambience is great - nice and relaxed. The building is always clean and the staff is always friendly. My favorite is the beef and broccoli. Heads up - if you like some heat they will accommodate you, but be advised, their hottest level isn't for the faint-hearted.

I've been looking for a good used car over the last couple of weeks. I've hit up most of the certified pre-owned dealers in the area, but happened to notice a Mini Cooper at an excellent price from LeSueur on USAA.  First, if a dealer works with USAA, that means they appreciate our veterans and that they're legit. You don't have to worry about shady dealers with USAA.  Second, they worked with me on my trade in and sold me a car at around $3,000 less than True Car average value.  Third, my visit with finance was quick without any intimidation tactics for me to purchase warranties, service plans, etc.  Folks, LeSueur is as good as it gets when it comes to a used car dealer.

Currently standing in this store, waiting for a receipt for returning my modem. I have to drive 500 miles today, and have told them this, but apparently they only have ONE printer to give me a receipt, and everyone here must be using this damn printer. I can't wait to leave this company in the dust.

My experience at Pearl was absolutely atrocious. The staff was rude, the food took forever, and the food was of mediocre quality.  My first impression wasn't negative. I thought the place looked like a decent sushi joint. The bar looked nicely decorated. Finding a table on Friday night required a miracle of biblical scale, so my friends and I sat at the bar. That was understandable given the location and day of the week.  Ten minutes later we were asked if we wanted any drinks. Seeing that the place was busy I decided to order as soon as possible. I ordered two rolls and miso soup. The soup took 15 minutes, which was pretty fast for this joint. Forty-five minutes later I finally received the rest of my rolls. I wanted to enjoy my food, but felt inclined to wait as the rest of my party did not receive their food for another twenty minutes. I raised the issue with a lady who apparently manages this place, to which she responded, "this is what it's like when any restaurant is busy". She showed absolutely no care or interest our satisfaction.   So to summarize, I'd rather get a root canal then visit this place again. I don't have high expectations when I dine, all I care about is for the food to be decent and timely. That was clearly too much to ask for at Pearl Sushi Lounge.

I have been a customer at Habanero's since the joint opened. The food is delicious, they have a great menu, and the staff is friendly.   Another great aspect of Habanero's is that they cater. Their mini-chimis are a great alternative to wings on Superbowl Sunday.  My personal favorite dish is the buenos nachos. Authentic? Nope, but it's really delicious. Their fish tacos and carne asada burritos are also great.

I go to the Tavern once a week to enjoy wings with friends. The Tavern Grille has the best wings in Scottsdale, bar none.The staff is friendly and the wait time is reasonable.

Really fast and friendly service - with delicious food to boot! I had the country benny, and it lasted about five minutes before it was gone. Great coffee too. No wonder this place is always busy! Thanks for the awesome brunch Butters!

If I can describe CFNS with one word, the word would be "family". This crew knows everything about respect, encouragement, accountability, and fun. I've been to other boxes, and while they were nice, none had an atmosphere remotely close to the environment at CFNS.

i don't ask much in my search for the perfect burger. Yes, it's nice to dine in a well kept restaurant. It's also enjoyable when the staff is interactive and friendly. A buzzing atmosphere is always a nice touch.   But when it comes down to it, when I'm looking for the Taj Mahal of burgers, it all balances on what is served. And let me tell you, RBT knows how to serve a burger that will satisfy your deepest bovine desires.   The menu is full of unique and staple burger offerings. The one that caught my attention, however, was the PBJ and Bacon burger. Upon reading the burger's description,  I felt more conflicted than a Southern Baptist at a Castro District drag show.   "Wait a minute, PBJ does not belong on a burger!"  "What?! The patty is drenched in sriracha?!"  "I can get it with a pretzel bun as well?!"  The universe, as I saw it, was collapsing everywhere I looked. None of this made any sense to my respectable burger palate, and I yearned to taste this forbidden concoction of beef, bacon, thai hot sauce, and pb&j. Not to be outdone by the unique burger, I forewent the pedestrian side of fries and ordered the Jamaican corn to accompany my otherworldly dish.  What happened when dinner was served is somewhat of a blur. No, I was not intoxicated (in the traditional sense) - I can only compare it to the moment when you first meet your soulmate. That moment you will never forget, but cannot remember to the fullest detail. With my very first bite, my synapses were firing at a rate that a M134 Minigun couldn't match. My eyes bulged with intense fulfillment, my skin emitted a cool sweat of indulgence, and I could have sworn I heard the faithful tune "Take my Breath Away" ringing in my subconscious state of euphoria. I had found it, the perfect burger was in my grasp and I felt unworthy.   The burger, like most fleeting romances, was gone before I could sincerely take in the magnitude of this event. Fortunately, the Jamaican corn was still at my disposal, and may God turn me into a horny toad if that side wasn't an outstanding compliment to the burger. Now the Jamaican corn wasn't from the same metaphysical realm from which the PBJ and Bacon burger originated, but it was more like a swan song for my recently departed dish, an ultimate tribute for the tantric experience of RBT.  RBT delivered when it counted most, and I'm not talking about a swift thrill, I'm talking about the kind of satisfaction that is almost melancholy, as if my burger pilgrimage was finally complete. Time will only tell if this is true, but until then, RBT is the home of my favorite burger.

My favorite bar and restaurant in Scottsdale. The staff remembers your name after the first time you visit. The food is unique and cooked with passion. The drinks are amazing and memorable. P&P is always clean and has a great group of customers.  Seriously folks, this place rocks. You have to try the Apocalypse Sow or the Bulgogi wraps. Or anything else on the menu.

They know how to make a darn good pizza pie, and the place has a great vibe. This joint is good for a quiet, more intimate date, or if you're just looking for some tasty Italian cuisine in south Scottsdale.

I love Suh Noi! The staff is always friendly and they have a unique offering for Thai fusion cuisine. They are quick to serve you and the ambience is great for a little fast-food joint. I love the decor!   This joint is a great little gem in South Scottsdale. If you like heat don't forget to ask for chef hot!
