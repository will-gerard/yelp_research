Google shows this store open until 5, showed up at 4:45 and was told they closed at 4:30. Explained that the website had the wrong time and the only solution was to come back tomorrow. I don't have time to be constantly calling small places like this and double checking their hours.

This place has very large portions! Not a very fancy restaurant, but good customer service and it was pretty clean.

The service is really good at this restaurant. The food was average for Mexican food, but felt more like a fast food place. Overall it's a very nice place for $. Would not recommend it for someone that likes authentic Mexican.

Excellent burger place! The music was interesting and the patio was beautiful. Little slow waiter and someone was smoking right by the patio.... Overall good experience!

The address using navigation is a little off, but the restaurant is here! Ordered the garlic knots as an appetizer which were delicious and came with a side of sauce for dipping. The restaurant is set up for dine in but M-F 11-4 you can buy slices and combos instead of a whole pie and get your meal much quicker. One recommendation I would make to everyone is look at the menu beforehand and be ready to order pizza as soon as you sit down because it takes 25 minutes to cook one pizza! This was a fun restaurant and I found it interesting that they match the water PH for cooking of that of New York, New York! The decorations of the building feel like a New York City subway and is fun and interesting. This is a fun restaurant to take friends to and the service will keep everyone happy!

Excellent burrito place! All of the food tasted home made and fresh. I ordered the green chile burrito and a side of chips and salsa. Everything was delicious! The outside looked a little sketchy at night, but inside everyone was friendly and welcoming. I would definitely eat there again!
