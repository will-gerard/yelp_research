Oh Yes! This place is GOOD! Only been once, real early on a Saturday morning but the place was already packed so make a reservation for sure. The Garlic plate appetizer is just awesome. I tried the mexican sampler with the chili relleno being my favorite but it was all real good. Definitely going back (with reservations) and trying some of the American fare next time. A little on the pricey side but they feed you well ( having my left overs for dinner) & the food is near excellent.  My only complaint is the lighting,  weird rose colored flood lights makes it very hard to see & if you get seated in the wrong place its like being on a stage with one of those lights blasting down on you.  But a great place for a date!

I don't get it.  To be fair, I've only had their pizza, while eatable, I would never go back. Its definitely a huge jump up from the Domino's & Pizza Huts but not even close to a Spinato's Pizza (my favorite) or a Casanova Brothers Pizza, as far as chains go, I think NYPD is much better than this.  I know I'm in the minority here & I love pizza but just not Nello's.

Not sure about all the bad reviews, for the money it's a nice get away. We didn't eat anything besides ice cream and saspirilla but the mine tour and crazy house where fun and guides are funny. We thought we would be there an hour or so , ended up being just over 3 hours and we didn't even ride the train that we paid for on the discounted 3 ticket package, If we did it would be 4 hours easy. Only negative was bring cash ! There are ATM's but they charge you $3 per withdrawal + whatever your bank charges. The 2 of us ended up spending about $50 total including ice cream, pop and little tip to each guide and we learned a little history . And there is lots of shopping , old west photos , etc

Drove by a hundred times and saw the reviews here on Yelp and figured I'd give it a try.  Best I can compare it to would be a poor imitation of a Filaberto's.  Neither of us finished our food & not because we were served huge portions.  I won't be back but I guess I'm in the minority here.

The food is average on a good day, I would of given a 3 star but EVERY time we go, all the dishes are filthy.  Dried food on the silverware, glasses & plates, last time the water tasted heavy of soap (at least they are using soap I guess).  I finally gave up & tried their new location in Mesa, same problem but not to the same extent.  Must be something in the management; they can't train or hire decent dish washers.

Alright, for all the hype I heard about this place, it is probably the worst pizza I've had in the valley (next to the new & improved Domino's, yuck!).   Maybe a long time ago it was good, I don't know, but now it is a big over priced blah!

Spinato's is by far our favorite pizza! But, this location has a limited menu & is very crowded, this is why the 4 stars, but the thin crust pizza is 5+, yum!

Idk why all the haters , I really enjoyed our experience .  Huge recliners , pretty  decent food , great service , no kids running around , I think our theater held less than 50 or so. During  a great movie I almost fell a sleep I was so relaxed . Ya , $23 for tickets for 2 and we spent $46 for two margaritas and an appetizer and two meals, I'd do it again

Only stopped by once while on a job site close by, as you can tell by their hours (10:30 to 3 M-F) they cater to the industrial area lunch crowd.  We had the rib tips and dynamite sandwich both were very good, although a bit on the pricey side.  The place is quite clean and off the beaten path but I'd definitely stop by again if I was in the area.

The Good: Service, Its Clean, Iced Tea  The So-So: Alfredo cheese pasta sauce  The Bad: All the rest of the food.  I really don't get the good reviews here.  $2 frozen pizza from the supermarket will blow this pizza away.  Dry (read almost no sauce) maybe 6 real thin pepperonis and cardboard crust, make grade school pizza look good.  Chicken has no flavor and was chewy and pasta dish was served only mildly warm.  Total waste of money.  How this 'chain' stays in business is beyond me.

Finally, a place to get an exceptional steak without going to one of the 'Prime' restaurants.  We've been looking since moving here a few years back for a descent steak & I've had some good ones but none as good as here.  While it won't rival the prime cut steaks, it is quite close and at only $21 for a 12oz ribeye and a loaded potato, what a deal. My wife had the spiced chicken pasta bowl and I'd give it 4 stars too, though I thought a little more chicken and less pasta would of been the perfect touch.  The onion ring appetizer is very nice as is the ambiance & service.  While its a 25 minute drive for me, I'd make the trip again and again.

Consistency is the key here.  I've had fabulous dishes here and the next time, not so much.  To be fair, the last time I was there , the manager noticed I didn't eat very much and asked me why & when I  told her it just wasn't very good, she was very apologetic, immediately refunded me and offered me a free dish of anything on the menu.  I know its not "Authentic" but read the health inspection reports of most of the 'Authentic' Chinese places, I pass on most of them.  This is the same food as PF Changs, just a lot cheaper and smaller selection.

Just Don't Do It!  Commissioned mechanics, up sale everything, the $99 job is a leader ad. Go to your dealer or local independent shop, you probably wont get ripped off there.  Took my truck in for the $99 pads, they called back and said it will be $850! The list that it needed was exactly as posted by other Just Brake customers throughout the country. Bad rotors, bearings, seals, springs, melted caliper pistons, leaky seals, old brake fluid, etc.... What a joke!

Pretty darn good but quite pricey even though you get big portions, you always have to take a bunch home.  I would like the option to buy less & pay less.  This is smoked meat, NOT BBQ.  Many people try to compare the two but they are different.  Some people just don't like smoked meat & some go in looking for BBQ and they will probably be disappointed.  If you like slow smoked meat you will be happy here. Also, if you truly like smoked meat, you already know to get the meat DRY, not WET.  The individual decides on how much if any sauce to put on.  Try their beef ribs(dry) if you like ribs.  Pork ribs just don't smoke as good in my opinion. I've been here 5 or so times and have never had anything dry, of course we go at lunch time so maybe its just fresher than at dinner (?)

We only go for brunch on weekends, so I can't talk about the service since we always get great service.  The fajitas are excellent(get grilled jalapeno's on the side) but my favorite is the Sunday brunch with eggs, steak & potatoes with the awesome chimachurri sauce.  I order a side of their chimachurri sauce every time we go regardless of what I order.  The shrimp dishes are quite good too.  The classic taco/enchilada plates are average.  The down side are the chips & salsa.  The chips are hit & miss, sometimes warm sometime cold.  The red salsa is too mild for us but has a decent taste, the other salsa they serve,  I cant even stand the smell of it, but maybe thats just me. On a plus, it has big screen tv's for sports on the weekends and its clean as could be.

I don't get the great reviews. While not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again . The chips are cold, salsa is blah to the max. The food is very pretty but lacking flavor except for the cheese crisp which is very tasty.  If you do go and have a choice between the red or green sauce, go red , the red has some good flavor to it, the green again is very blah

Best pizza we have found yet in the valey (haven't tried the thick crust yet).  The garlic knots are wonderful.  The philly cheese steak is quite good.  The owners are a great bunch, nice as could be,  go once & they know your name from then on, a nice touch.

I never thought I would write a review for a shoe store but this place is awesome!  I'm a beginning runner and was having pain in my feet so I decided to give them a try & I am glad I did!  After my Video Gait Analysis my sales girl brought out about 1/2 dozen or so shoes and she explained why she picked these certain shoes for me & after walking and running in all of them we narrowed it down to 3 pairs & then she brought out another 3 or 4 pair. I was literally taking all these shoes for a test run until I decided what I liked best, it took just over 90 minutes and I never ever felt rushed.  I love my new shoes and my feet don't hurt now.  Prices are right in line, couldn't ask for more.

Great little weekend breakfast spot that isn't full of snow birds (not yet anyway). Decent menu selection and food is very good , service is excellent . It's basically their bar area that the turn to a restaurant on weekends so you have sports on quite a few TV's but it's not loud or crowded.

Okay, first off my bad ! I called and scheduled  a new windshield for my wife's 3 month old (new) car. I was asked if it had a heated windshield & I said nope just a base car(Subaru). Installer came out and removed windshield before he realized that we do have a heated windshield! Had no idea:-). Anyway they were back a few hours later with the correct part and without any complaints due to my screw up. Just call them , I will for now on

Pharmacy is the WORST!  Waited in line for a flu shot , to be told to get in another line . After 15 minutes in the 2nd line we filled out some paper work and were given a beeper. They said in 15-20 minutes when it goes off go up to the register , pay and get your shot.  Ok, after almost 1 hour at Costco later it goes off, we go up to the pharmacy register with our little buzzer to be told to get back in line of over 20 people, no thanks!

What Happened? The original Tia's is very good, but something went terribly wrong here.  The food is cold and has a very 'Gamey" taste to it.    Sorry, i think this is my 1st 1 star review, but I just can't get over how bad the food & the service was.

Let me get the negative out first, the lighting!  It makes me almost sick and takes a while to get used to, really dark purple colored lights, yuk!  The food is really good (try the garlic plate if your not on a 1st date).  Prices are a little high but not out of touch.  Would be a great place for a date.  Make reservations, it gets busy, hence service can be less than spectacular.

Real good, mesquite grilled steaks, burgers, chicken ect. in a rustic, yet clean setting.  Fair prices, decent selection, the service was excellent.   Its only about 7 minutes off of the US 60 (take the Idaho exit, not Tomahawk) .  If you want a different atmosphere, give it a try, you wont be disappointed.   Only down side is that It is a snowbird mecca

Went for lunch and had the pizza / salad special, pretty good all around.  We decided to order a meal delivered  a few weeks later , this is when it all went bad .  The pizza was wrong , not just missing something but totally wrong . I called them right away, the driver couldn't of been a 1/4 mile away , any way we got the pizza we ordered 45 minutes later , cold and hard  as a rock and then they insisted that we give back the other pizza that had been sitting on our counter for almost an hour.  One & done here.

Very basic, but very good!  They are best known for their pork, but since I don't eat pork, I tried their beef & chicken.  I preferred their chicken but my wife liked the carna asada best, can't go wrong with either.  Everything they make is fresh daily and all 3 salsa are wonderful! Prices are low, service is fast & friendly, the owners are as nice as can be.  We'll worth the stop. We will definitely be back.

Best Pizza in AZ, hands down!  This location is the best of the bunch but can get crowded.  Has a nice bar area and is a lot more spacious than the Tempe location.  They also have the full menu here (unlike Tempe) even though we usually just stick with the pizza, it is soooo good!

Love this place! Everything is so fresh.  I think they should be up for best tacos in the valley.  I would give everything I've tried so far a 4 or 5 star except for their carne asada, while not bad just okay.  Also, not a fan of ordering at the counter but that's just a small knock.  The warm fresh  chips are excellent (what ever happened to warm chips at most places?) The mild sauce is wonderful but their hot sauce is awesome!  The enchilada sauce has a very light and homemade taste, the beans are creamy and flavorful.    We will keep coming back.

The brisket is wonderful, super tasty bark, nice smoke ring.  We got the cutters choice which is in between the juicy yet fattier cut and the lean cut, a good all round compromise.  Wasn't a big fan of the sauces, not bad but nothing spectacular but the brisket is so good you really dont need any.  The mac&cheese is good, as is the cole slaw, wasn't a fan of the cream corn, just too sweet for me. I wish they had some greens to choose from.

You can get massage by a student or a licensed therapist but the LMT's are more expensive , I think they are $39 per hour but still a killer deal.  I haven't seen a student yet but the people I talk to have nothing but positive things to say about them . Definitely worth a try

Awesome! Clean as a pin, the decor is wonderful and the food, oh the food!  Everything was excellent but the red chile beef was out of this world!  The chips and salsa are warm and fresh but I preferred the 'Hot' salsa.  The portions are huge and the price is very reasonable, its a keeper!

Came in late on a Saturday nite after getting the top of my finger ripped off, nothing but praise for these guys! Got me in right away and even got me in pretty fast the next day for a follow up even though they were really busy. They do get overwhelmed but they prioritize pretty well, if you are bleeding like a pig you will get seen before someone with a cough.  Some people don't like that but that's the way it needs to be.

The meat is not smoked just baked I think.  The brisket is very fatty any lacks taste , the chicken is tasteless.  The Mac & Cheese is on par with boxed with some jalapeños added, the corn bread was cold, the cole slaw was so so. The buns for the sandwiches are very good.  If you are in the area just go to Joes BBQ, much better and real smoked meats.

The pizza is outstanding!  I usually eat 2, sometime 3 slices of a large pizza, today I had 5! I couldn't stop eating it.  Wonderful sauce & cheese, the crust is thin and slightly crisp, cooked to perfection.  The only down side for us was the pasta red sauce was slightly too sweet and almost every menu item had ham in it, I'm not a ham fan. but that's just me.  The place is clean and decorated very nicely, the owners are supper nice and service is top notch (even though you order at the counter, they take care of you after that).  We will definitely be back.

Probably the best 'non-prime' steaks we've had in the valley.  I had the rib-eye and my wife had the filet, both slightly over cooked but the bark / seasoning is wonderful & they were tender & juicy.  Even though I'm a rib-eye lover, next time I am getting the filet, it was wonderful.  The Texas onion was just okay, no where near as good as Outbacks but acceptable but I dont think I would get it again.  Loved the atmosphere , service was above average & prices are in line.  Definitely give it a try.

Very clean , good + service, very good menu.  So far all the food has been very good to excellent.  Two salsas , one is a sweet mango the other is a classic mild red.  I wish they had a real hot sauce to offer . Carna Asada is one of the better ones around. We will be back

Can't say enough about the trainers, staff and fellow crossfitter's . 10 years of office work and sitting on the couch caught up to me & I needed to do something besides dieting (i love food) and to be truthful crossfit scared me but I saw what it did for a couple of my friends, both in their 40's and 50's. So glad I tried it! They work around my old injuries and still give me a great workout , something new all the time and not sure what it is but very addictive.  All workouts are "scalable " to your fitness level so you do what you can do not what  the Rx workout says if you can't do it. I lost 14  lbs in 2 months while gaining muscle and no dieting and feeling great all around.

Food is visually pleasing, beyond that I can't say too much good.  The food is extremely bland, no taste what so ever. I have no idea how they get any reviews above 2 stars, I give the taste a 1 star, but the presentation a 4.  The meats taste like they are boiled with no spices at all, the beans and rice are totally blah.  The cheese enchilada and cheese crisp are quite good but again the Hatch chilies are not spicy at all, how does that happen? The chips are cold, they have 3 salsas, the mild is full of corn and horrible , the red is okay and a bit spicy, the green is pretty good and has a bite to it. Just not enough good to make us want to go back .

Really awesome pasta dishes, I love the fact they don't use sausage in every dish.  Wished they had garlic bread as a side.  Pizza is good, wife likes it a lot more than I do, probably wouldn't order it if not for her.  Side salads are pricey but entrees will leave you enough for lunch the next day and are priced right.  Nothing fancy , real casual but yummy.

Pizza is just about the right size for a quick lunch, try the firecracker crust, not real spicy but has some taste to it. Only down side is crust is a little soggy for me, not a deal beaker but a little crisp to the bottom would be better.  Neat idea and pretty tastey all the way around.

Okay;! Wife hates having her hair done , she has been hacked too many times. For Mother's Day we bought her a gift certificate to Tiffany's and she was Luke warm to the idea (at the best)!  Finally she made the reservation via text , which she liked, and was still scared to death on the day of the appointment.  Well, my wife LOVES Tiffany! She is sold! not only do we love her hair but the service and price are exceptional! Just give her a try, really !
