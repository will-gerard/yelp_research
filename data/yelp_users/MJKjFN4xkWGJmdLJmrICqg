Noodles was by far the best restaurant we've eaten at during this stay at the Bellagio. My food was fantastic and I'm not big on Asian cuisine. The hubs didn't like his dish and they whisked it away and brought him something else. He LOVED the second dish. They also noticed he dripped on his shirt and appeared out of nowhere with a warm cloth and baking soda solution for him to work at the spot. The customer service was by far the best we've experienced in a long time while in Las Vegas. It was a shining spot of quality food and service amidst the overall mediocre-ness of our stay at the Bellagio. (That's for a different review.)

We have been frequenting Richardson's for the last three years at least 3-4 times a month. The last time we visited the hostess sat us in what I like to refer to as the concrete-hole booth where no one can see you and you cannot see out (if you've been there you know which one I'm talking about). The hostess then neglected telling our server we were there so we sat in the concrete abyss for nearly 15 minutes before our server peeked over the wall at us. That visit ended well as the server knew how upset we were and did everything she could to make it right.   However, today we had a server I never met before. She left us sit for a while too, but we were in full view of her and every other staff member. When she finally came to our table, we inquired about chocolate milk for my granddaughter and received an emphatic "NO", not "No, I'm sorry we don't have chocolate milk but we do have..." just a rude abrupt NO followed by silence. Then my scrambled eggs arrived with the entire top of the pile just sort of jellied, not runny but definitely 'jellied'. She kindly took them back to the kitchen to throw back on the grill for a second or two. She returned with a plate of rubbery, burnt eggs and told me next time I need to request "hard scrambled". Well, NO dear lady, next time I would like my eggs scrambled the way they should be, soft and fluffy with no jellied grossness hanging around the top or the middle. We then sat, and sat,  and sat, and sat staring at my pile of uneaten food and my companions dirty dishes. When she ignored us and walked away one last time I said, "Excuse me Ma'am. Can we get our check please." At this point I was met with a rude "Give me a minute!" accompanied by a feisty glare. My husband then suggested maybe I should wait outside while he settled the bill. Good thing for her I took his advice because I don't generally respond well to rude, feisty glares.   Richardson's... I am sorely disappointed and this last experience will probably keep me from coming back because if you try to seat me in that girls station I'll get up and leave. You should do the math: 3-4 times a month at nearly $100 a pop. That's a lot of lost revenue.  And since I'll be sure to share my experience with others, you should remember, word of mouth is a powerful advertising tool as well.   I used to love you. Now I'm just booooooo Richardson's, I'm taking my money down the street.

Awesome experience for my first tattoo! Bob was fantastic. Of the 3 studios I visited this was hands down the place I was supposed to be for my inaugural ink. I relied on Yelp since everyone I know with a tattoo got it in some other state or city. And some lovely young men at a piercing studio told me The Golden Rule was THE place to go. They were right. Thanks Bob. I'll be back soon for another!    pace e bene! (peace and goodness)

I visited with Bob again for my fourth tattoo. This one was a larger piece and placement was on my outer thigh. I'm a late comer to tattooing but I'm making up for lost time. Ha!  Bob did an amazing job! He captured the typewriter font we chose PERFECTLY! He did an amazing job creating the (old fashioned typewriter lingo to follow...) 'strike marks' left from the 'keys'. It is PERFECTION! I can't say enough good things about Bob's work.  pace e bene people! peace and goodness. Micah 6:8  Do Justly. Love Mercy. Walk Humbly.  Thanks again Bob!

Like a lot of other reviewers I'd have to say the food is 5 star but the service is horrendous. We were blatantly ignored once and got up and left after 15 minutes of staring at the menu. We gave it another shot and actually made it to the ordering part; and the food really is phenomenal once you actually get someone to take your order and bring it to you. The horrible service explains why it is never busy when we've gone. Which is unfortunate because we love the food. If they ever bring this place all together into a 5 star worthy eatery they will have a money making gem there! Until then know it's hit or miss on the service. More miss than hit. And honestly for me that was their last chance to gain me as a regular. Sorry Otro.

Hands down the best Mexican food I've had in forever! Service is awesome. Food is phenomenal! Salsa is perfectly hot like I love it. Chips and tortillas are homemade. And because we LOVE this place so much and are here at least twice a week, we are greeted like long lost friends every time we visit.   ps) we were told the liquor license was awarded and they are in the final steps of carrying delish Mexican alcoholic beverages in addition to the awesome authentic Coke in the fridge by the counter.
