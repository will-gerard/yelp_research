Go for Happy Hour and you will be HAPPY!  Tacos, tostadas, street corn.  Chips are thick and salsa is good.

Don't get Breonna as your server. Didn't ask if we wanted another drink after we decided to stick to appetizers. She didn't appear to know where the water was or remembered we were at one of her tables. Food was good as always.
