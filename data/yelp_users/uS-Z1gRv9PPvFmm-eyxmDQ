We went to celebrate a birthday and Ruth's Chris did not disappoint. We made a reservation through 'Open Table' for 7:15p.   Upon arrival the staff was very friendly and wished the birthday girl a very happy birthday and as we were escorted to a very nice table near the window overlooking the patio with nice views of the park across Indian Bend. We felt very welcomed.  I ordered the 22oz T-Bone cooked medium and the birthday girl had the 11oz filet medium as well. Our sides were mushrooms and potatoes Au gratin. All was delicious but I regret not trying the Lobster Mac n Cheese. All steaks were cooked as ordered and the potatoes were amazing!   Our server was very attentive and he surprised us with a complimentary birthday dessert at the end of our dinner. Great experience! A++
