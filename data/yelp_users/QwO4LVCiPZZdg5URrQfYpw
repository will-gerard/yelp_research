I'd like to rate this from the catering/event side. I recently went to a reunion here. We had over 100 people and I was surprised how great the service was. The food was very good. We all had the best time. The owner was there and he made ABSOLUTELY sure people had a good time. I'd recommend them for big occasions.

This place saddens me. It is a void. It has a sterile atmosphere. The sandwiches were dry and not very good. The prices were high. The only reason that I went was because they handed out coupons in my neighborhood. If I had to say something good about this place, it would be that it is clean.

I would say that the sushi is mediocre at best. The rolls have a texture to them that I don't enjoy. On top of that, the prices are far too high. You might as well buy some pre-made sushi from the grocery store.

You know. I really don't have much to say about this place that is bad. I've been there a number of times and have also had their catering.  Their beans are very good. Slightly sweet with the right amount of spice. Hot links are spot on. Pulled beef and pork sandwiches are good, but the meat could be more tender. I am very picky about my potato salad, but theirs isn't bad.

I've lived here all of my life (33 yrs) and somehow I had never heard of this place. The exterior is unassuming, to say the least.   Good food. Huge portions. Excellent service. Mostly under 8 bucks. Definitely worth going to. Don't let the structure fool you. The inside is much nicer.

This is a no-brainer. Go. It has weird hours. Go. The menu is complicated. Go. Good Tex-Mex and Northern Mexican. I was born here and have spent a lot of time in Mexico. I don't mess around with OK Mexican places.  No frills. No convenience. No BS. Great food.

I am indeed a fan. If you're down for some mariscos in Central Phoenix you should defitely try it out. Reasonable prices for good food. The mariscos are the upper end of the menu. There are also cheaper texmex items if you are in the snacking mood. They recently began accepting credit cards. Nice wait staff. Pleasant.

My family has been going here for a long time, but until recently I insisted on using my own mechanic. When he moved away I began going here. Here were the three situations.  1. My battery went out and my Acura stereo wouldn't start without a code. I took the car to them and one of them ran out, popped the hood, jumped into the car, did some special trick, turned on the radio, jumped out and said, "There you go, don't worry about it." THEY DIDN"T CHARGE ME!!!!!!!!  2. My wife was driving our car on the south side and blew a flat. Her dad changed the tire and shore off two of the posts. I had it towed to Precision with the new posts in hand. They fixed it that day and only charged me $40!  3. I had a crack in my radiator and a couple of hoses. I figured it would be very expensive. I took it over there and they had it replaced in the same day for $340.  They are honest and efficient. They do not overcharge. Many other people know this so they are always doing a LOT of business. They are THE best in the Central Phoenix corridor.

I can't believe I'm the first to write a review on this place. This place is tucked away behind a butcher/grocer called Segal's. I went for lunch and ordered a calzone. My wife ordered some slices. Though the ambience was very plain the food was delectible. Definitely worth going.  ***I've noticed that recently they've added sushi to the menu...hmmm.

Normally I don't have something so nice to say about any chain but after today I do. My brother was working on his eagle scout badge on Piestewa Peak. We wanted 3 three foot subs. We called another Subway the night before nearby and they said they were too busy to take the order. So we called this place. They had everything ready for us at 10am sharp with all of the fixings all boxed up. AND the guy walked the stuff out and loaded it up in the truck. This guy was happy..and polite...not appearing to be all of those things at work at 10am was actually pretty neat. I think he might be the owner...but regardless. The food was good and looked like he actually put time and energy into it's presentation. I only had one employee I was interacting with. But give him a promotion or support his business.

I recently revisited Spinato's with my parents and brother's family. Though I thought their pizza was really good I was taken back by how delicious their cheesy garlic bread was. I could have just eaten that with a little salad and have been very happy. The portions were generous. I saw one of the calzones and WOW...it was huge! I really want to go back for one (seriously, you have to see it. It looks like someone folded a pizza over a ham). Overall, very warm and inviting people. Good food.

I have been here twice for emergency situations. Once for my wife and once for myself. Both times were on Sunday mornings around 9am 'ish. Both times we were triaged within a few minutes of entering. My wife for an allergic reaction and myself for a broken bone. Both times we were helped very quickly and had a good experience. The nurses were top notch and had a good bedside manner. I am thankful for their medical attention.

I decided to wait until I had eaten a couple of meals to rate this place. I had some of their sandwiches and two of their thin crust pizzas. Their thin crust is pretty good. Good toppings, thin on the sauce, overall it'll put a smile on your face. Their extra large thin crust will feed 5 adults pretty easily. It has a very relaxed atmosphere. My niece and the children at the other table approved. The bar had a few televisions with different football games on them.

OK. Imagine the Grand Canyon had ice cream. Not the best ice cream, but hey it's ice cream. Would you tell people, "Yeah I went to the grand canyon, but the ice cream was just alright. I don't know if I'd recommend it." If you would, take a run as fast as you can (head first) into a wall, come back and read this again.  No! The pizza isn't the best. But hey! It's pizzaI The Organ is what you are going for. Take your kids and anyone else you can pack into your car and go. Have a day!

OK food at best. The bread is the only good part of anything. 7 dollar peanut butter and jelly? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? The only reason that I would ever go to My Florist Cafe is because my parents enjoy going.  If you enjoy good piano music, there is an excellent pianist who plays there every so often.  So much potential, so little of it realized.

One of my friends insisted that I try Lolo's so we went during a lunch hour. Fortunately we arrived before it got crowded. I ordered the a combination plate that included about half of the items on the menu. About 15 minutes later our food arrived, but my order was everything on the menu but what I ordered. I figured that since it looked and smelled so good I would bite my lip and eat what I had in front of me. The waitress walked by and noticed. She insisted that they make me the plate that I ordered and the one that I had been eating was on the house. At first I said no...but she wouldn't hear of it. The rest of the menu was sitting in front of me in five minutes. Now...I am a good sized guy with a ravenous appetite, but that was ridiculous. I will say that everything was delicious. I had a little bit of everything. The highlight of the meal was the MACARONI AND CHEESE. BEFORE YOU DIE (caution: it might be the CAUSE of your death) you must eat their mac and cheese.  All in all, a great eating experience.

I would like to preface my review with a little background on me. I was born in Phoenix 33 years ago. Over the years I have tried hundreds (if not thousands) of Tex-Mex restaurants in Phoenix, the U.S. Southwest, and Mexico itself.   The first Tex-Mex I ever had was at this Los Compadres. I have had everything on the menu more than 20 times. How I feel about the food at the 7th Avenue Los Compadres I can only relate in analogy. It is Garfield's lasagna, Bert's oatmeal, Laestrygonian's lotus, Olympian Ambrosia, and Elvis's peanut butter and banana freakin' sandwiches all wrapped into a burrito, and gilded.  Do not get this and the sister restaurant confused. There is NO substitute.

My family has been living in the neighborhood since the mid-50's. This is the place my grandparents, parents, and now I have taken our pets. Our pets have always lived long and happy lives. My last dog lived to be 17, which was way beyond her expectancy.   Yes, we have received some large bills from Alta Vista, but we have also seen them cure animals that should definitely have died. I will always take my pet here.

I really appreciate having Pino's around the corner. Their pizza, sandwiches and plates are very good.   I must state this: Their meatballs are to die for! Get 'em. They melt in your mouth.   I'm also a big fan of their penne primavera. A wonderful combination of vegetables (Zucc, broc, and friends) in a nice sauce mixed with penne al dente.  Pizza is reliably good.  Though it is at a low volume, I'm not a fan of the music.  Pino is always there. Say hi.

Ah Pita Jungle. I've been going there for 14 years now. They served me my first hummus. I've had a number of friends who worked there over the years. The service is the only dynamic factor in my rating. I've run the gambit as far as that is concerned. Overall they are solid. If you are a dip person, try ordering a half and half order of their garlic dip and hummus. Totally worth it. Their shawarma always hits the spot. The falafel platter is the best buy for the money.

I've been going to Haji Baba since '99 and I have NEVER been disappointed. Nothing that I write will do this place justice. I have had everything but the Kibbi (sp?). Their hummus is always spot on. The Fallafel is always crispy but maintains moistness. Their gyros are delicious. The chicken is beyond reproach.   Afterwards its is always fun to peruse the store. Good prices all around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have to give this place a five star review. I teach at a local middle school. We had a standing reservation with Lifetime pool for 275 students. The Friday before we were scheduled to go (we were scheduled for Monday) Lifetime announced that the pool wouldn't be available to us. Keep in mind all of the kids had already paid 9 dollars and the money had been sent to district. The kids had all brought in permission slips...IT WAS A MESS!  Tri-City Bowl bailed us out. They were able to take us in on VERY LITTLE notice. They pulled out all of the stops for the kids. It was amazing. I've been teaching for 12 years and have been on many field trips. These people were AWESOME. The kids had a BLAST. Thank you Tri-City Bowl. You people saved us and the kids won't stop talking about what a great time they had. All of the people who work there are GREAT.

Nice bar, but otherwise gringo slop. This is amateur hour people. Their food  is a colossal failure. It's no wonder Bush likes to eat here when he is in town. No self respecting Arizonan or Mexican would ever return here for a second gastronomic beating. The beans were crap. The enchiladas were crap. The tacos were ok at best. The salsa wasn't great. There should be a helpline.

I give this rating based on four things  1) There hamburgers and caprese sandwich were very good.  2)The service was great.  3) Very mellow ambient qualities (music, lighting, etc)  4) The bathroom was awesome. I am not joking. If I were rating this place based solely on the quality of their bathrooms, they'd definitely get a five.  Gripes: $9.50 for a burger that doesn't come with fries. I think most people would complain about that.

Today I realized I hadn't updated my review for Fifth Avenue Cafe in 5 years. New owners have bought it in the interim. They regularly do different experiments for specials which have been great 100% of the time I've ordered them. The lunches have improved since they have taken over. The service is VERY good. Very friendly servers and owners. You can tell that everyone there is treated well.

The food here is excellent. They experiment a little too much with the cilantro, but aside from that it is very good.   The food is a fusion of different Latin American dishes, ranging from cuban to Argentine.   Their steak de vaquero is absolutely delicious. You can't go wrong. Their pollo ajadrea was a bit on the fruity side for me. In my opinion the apricots were a bit too much. The camarones de patron had a good bite too them. Very savory. The ropa vieja was good...but I've been spoiled by my father's.  If you decide to sit outside keep in mind that they share a plaza with a dance studio. A number of times I have been bombarded with the likes of Britney Spears.  This is a fairly pricey place. Be prepared for a bill you would be accustomed to pay at a very nice restaurant.  Good for dates or taking your parents out for a nice meal.

Last Saturday was my father's 65th birthday. We ordered catering for about 40 people. Just about everything came through with flying colors. The caterer/part owner showed up exactly on time. He was very positive, but was not underfoot during the setup of the party. All of the food was just about perfect at the serving time. I thought the lentils could have been a little softer, but aside from that: the ropa vieja and pernil were very tender, the beans were perfectly cooked and spiced, and the salad tasted great.

Just had my father's 70th birthday. They customed our meal to my parents' likings. We started with croquets and salad Which were delicious. Though the salad included walnuts...of which I'm not the biggest fan, the croquets were flakey and the meat was seasoned well. The main dishes included a Panko fried, thickly cut tilapia that was covered in a semi spicy pepper sauce, pernil asada that is HANDS DOWN the best pulled pork I could ask for, spiced mashed potatoes (against my diet but well worth the splurge), green beans and a pasta dish that I was too stuffed to try (and my carbs were already high). I tried a bite of the cheese cake which was awesome. The chocolate chip horchata bread was creative but not to my liking, but I also have an extremely high standard for anything sweet.   The service was superb! They were well trained and deserving of big tips. They didn't get in the way but were very pleasant at the same time.  Great left overs. I'm looking forward to lunch. The chef has really matured in quality over the past 5 years since my first review, and even then they were a 4 star restaurant in my book.   All 24 of us had a great time.

I've been going to Hon Man Tait for at least 10 years now. He was actually recommended to me through a friend of mine who is a mechanic himself (European cars). Anyway, Tait has always stuck by his promises and guarantees. I'd be surprised if he's said a dishonest thing in his life.  Tait is well educated and very honest. He gets the job done well for a reasonable price. I will always recommend him.

I don't get it. I only go there because it's a short walk from my house and fast (and Pino's is closed for weekends). I've heard people rave about this place. It's about as good as papa johns. Pino's al Centro is almost next door. Go there.

Both times I've eaten there for lunch it has been great! Polite and quick service. The place was pretty stylish and clean. Good prices for great tortas.  I did read about the unfortunate soul below who had a slippery take out experience, but both times I ate in the restaurant. A nice mom and pop place to enjoy a good torta.

Switch has treated me very well every time I've gone there. I particularly enjoy going there right before the dinner rush. I've noticed that the quality of food that comes out of the kitchen is especially good right before they get busy (as rings true with most restaurants). At the top of my list is their crab sandwich, their cheese burger, and their paninis. They have heavy pours on their specialty drinks that are very good...keep in mind I walk/stumble home so be careful if you're driving.

A neighborhood place. My brother lives on that side of town, so I've gone with family on a couple of occasions. It's actually pretty good. The atmosphere is ok. I had the lasagna and the veal (I hope I'm not making enemies) both of which were very good. Great appetizers. Don't shy away from the calamari and the fried cheese. Mmmm. Make plans to go to the gym the next day.

Warning! Certain dishes are very spicy. I know you're thinking "well it's because it's thai, man". Just know that when they ask you if you want it "Thai hot" or "regular hot" that you answer carefully. I would recommend going with a conservative answer the first time. I'm a fan of habaneros and jalapenos. I like anything spicy. I just went for it. WOW! Kablam! Three things that I've had over there. Pad Thai...pretty good, no spice (of course). Drunken Noodles...freaking awesome, a little spice to them. Hot and sour soup...Don't eat it in front of people who don't know you. You might lose control over your sinuses. I get this for sinus or upper respiratory infections. Everything I've ordered has been good and reasonably priced. Healthy sized portions. Everyone I've gone with left happy. The waitresses are very nice.

Finally, a place that advertises Spanish sausage and doesn't hand me a Mexican chorizo. I enjoyed a very nice lunch sitting on the back patio the other day. I ordered the cheese and sausage panini. The service was very friendly and I left much happier than when I arrived.

My cousin rented this place out the day before yesterday for a dinner after her wedding rehearsal. It was magnificent.   I spoke with the owner and she was very nice. The service was EXCELLENT. The food was very good and everyone had a great time. I tried many of their pizzas and their salad. The pizzas were being cooked fresh and nobody left hungry. The bride and groom were very pleased with presentation, service and a good time was had by all.  I would like to say that parking downtown is difficult during sports events, so plan on parking in a paid lot or VERY far away during a game.  I would highly recommend this place for any occasion.   A special thanks to the owners for making this dinner so special for my family.

This place is great! It is a very casual eatery that opens up to Indian School, so don't expect ambiance. It has the feel of the East Coast to it. Very friendly, very homey. One time I showed up and the employees were passing a football around with customers in the parking lot.   So far I've had their slices and a meatball sub. Get this! $4 for two slices and a drink. I had them throw some meatballs on for an extra 50 cents. Delicious. These were just the warmed up slices, but they were actually really good! The meatball sub was pretty tasty too.   Nice people, good food, cheap prices!

I really enjoy this place. With a new addition to my family, my wife and I are looking for less formal and less expensive places to eat. We started eating here because the Phoenix Community Acupuncture was across the parking lot. We really feel as if we've found a gem in our part of town.   Informal, connected to a store and there are places where Baliwood videos could be turned down...but well worth it.   We have gone for the buffet each time we have gone. The price is very reasonable and they don't mind that our one year old picks off of our plates. Everything is good, but the Tika Masala was very tender and delicious.

It was a Monday and all of the regular chinese haunts were closed. I decided that I would give the old Pho Bang one last try. Much to my delight I realized a change in the name. My hopes began to rise.   To begin the prices were VERY reasonable (about five dollars a plate, six if you want the everything plate). The patrons were primarily (but not exclusively) Vietnamese families.   My wife enjoyed her tofu and vegetable stir fry. I had a delicious pork plate. We encountered a language barrier with the server that was quickly overcome by pointing to our choice on the menu. The staff was very friendly. I will be going back.

First, I'd like to say is that the only reason I didn't give El Ranchero five stars is because of the setting. The spray painted building, walk up ordering and telenovelas SHOULD be overlooked due to the quality of the food...but I know that some people calculate ambient qualities such as these. Personally, I would risk crossing the 38th parallel to get food like this. Words of warning: No English speakers there, but gringos are welcomed with accommodating smiles and nods. Also, CASH ONLY! Once you get past the skin of the place and down to the food only one thing should  be known... El Ranchero is, without a doubt, serving some of the best food in Phoenix!  I got an order of carne asada gorditas with some rice and beans. I noticed that the gorditas came with a sort of Au Jus (later I found out that it was the caldo de res). The gorditas alone were a wonderful conglomeration of carne asada, potatoes, lettuce and onions. But when I added a dash of amazing salsa and a splash of Au Jus (caldo) the meal sang.  Wow! I'm glad I finally went after passing it up so many times.

I really enjoyed the food I had from America's Taco Shop North last night. The Burro de Pastor rotisserie pork was wonderful, though I could have done without the pineapple. The salsa that came with the chips was GREAT! The guacamole was fresh and amazing. The bean and cheese burrito was highlighted by a buttery soft flour tortilla. I will definitely be frequenting this shop. They've done a great job with lifting the curse of that particular corner.

This is a great place to visit if you are into cover bands and 21 year old wooh girls. They charge 10 dollars for a rum and coke in a mason jar. It's all over the place. I personally can't stand it. Nice cars in the lot though. Scottsdale with a throwback Phoenician name like the duce. To say this is reminiscent of the old produce section of Phoenix is like saying David Duke rally is a perfect representation of the Apollo club. Nightmare. Glad I only had to go there once. The employees were rude. They shouldn't run a barn.

The reviews left by the elites were very accurate. Freddy did a great job.  I had difficulty contacting my family plumber so I read through yelp reviews of plumbers. I had very bad results going with the corporate operations before so I was looking for a privately owned plumber.  Freddy showed up within two hours of me calling. He quoted me a 2-3 hour wait. He assessed the situation within a few minutes while making polite conversation. He is very personable.   He cleared the clog and spent some time cleaning up. I was actually super impressed by the cleaning he did. I hadn't seen the fixtures pop like that!   I live in a historical home and am particular about who works on it. He will be my go to plumber. I'm VERY happy with his work.

Wow! I tried out some of their food at the Phoenix Local First Festival last year and loved the faux chicken wings. They were delicious. I had planned on going to the restaurant but had mostly forgotten about it until recently when a friend of mine had a birthday party there.  I was so impressed! Everything was delicious. I had a little bit of everything at the table and enjoyed it all. I ordered a Po Boy sandwich for myself. It was tremendous! A little spice on the previously mentioned chicken wings.   They had some truly stand out hummus. Absolutely incredible chili fries...I'm going back soon. So good!

My brakes started to fail on my way to work. They did a good job and even gave me a coupon for teachers which saved me 50 bucks. Allen the manager even gave me a ride to work. My mechanic is in central Phoenix and told me they did a good job and gave me a good price. What luck!

Ok...so my brother decides this might be a good place to grab a couple of beers to start of a 3 man bachelor party. It's a Friday and we decide to meet up around 6:30 after work. We walk in and I go to the bar to get some starter beers. The bartender is very friendly and helps me select a nice IPA that wasn't bad at all. 7.2% with a nice floral hop.   So we get to the porch and we're enjoying our first drinks. I'm getting involved in the Crimea/Ukraine/Putin conversation when at the height of a poignant gesture the chair gives way and I flip backwards. I knocked my head against the chair and my butt hit the ground...overall not that bad but I'm a little dazed. The waitress takes the chair and gets me a new one. My brother orders some food and two more beers for the table.  One of the really nice waiters mentions it's happened before and they should replace the seats....YES, YOU SHOULD! is the phrase echoing in my mind.  I hunt down the owner of the place...by this time the place is getting kind of packed, but I was angry. I found her and she says, "Sorry about that, here's my card"...  Whatever...aside from the owners not caring AT ALL about people's safety (let alone making good on their negligence) it's not a bad place. I wrote down my number...maybe they'll make good...or not, I don't care at this point.   Money wasted.

It was good of the owner to comment on my post. They mentioned we stayed for another hour....yes waiting for our next beer and an order of putine for my brother. I did have to hunt the manager/owner(?) down. She did not find me. I understand they were slammed. We were polite and tried to have a good time anyway. The beer and putine were eventually served after I actually went BACK to the owner and complained after a LONG wait (during which our beers weren't served to us). I don't hold any ill will against the establishment, but I won't be returning. I WILL also tell of my experience.

I found this service amidst my turmoil with THOUSANDS of bees congregating a tree in my front lawn. They came out and had the colony destroyed within 50 minutes (ON A SUNDAY!). Thank you, thank you, thank you! They charged me $165 as their flat fee. They took away at least five pounds of bees.   There were a few stragglers for a day that eventually dispersed when they figured out what was up.   WOOHOOO!
