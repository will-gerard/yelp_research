Love it- cleanest location I've been to yet. Friendly staff, great workout gear- they have TRX, machines, treadmills, etc. Pleasant surprise! It's a shame they'll be exiting the AZ market and that I'll be transitioned to LA Fitness.

Best customer service from our waiter, who was very personable, friendly and had insightful knowledge and opinions about the dinner menu. We have only been once for a special occasion and this made it a real treat! Food was pretty good, and entrees were priced for a ritzier restaurant but we offset that with a gift card. $80-100 and over on average for a steak dinner for two with drinks and appetizers is what you would be expecting to pay.

Best Italian deli in Phoenix valley , bar none. The service is on par, quality and authenticity of their Italian soups, sandwiches, and salads are top notch. Would travel 20+ miles to come here any day for lunch or dinner. We like getting the meatball with Parmesan with an added layer of Prosciutto. Just heavenly Italian food!

Consistently amazing Italian food. This is not Olive Garden or Applebee's level of quality- this is very decent quality food. They appear to use wholesome ingredients and their wood-fired pizza is the bomb dot com.!!!

This is my new favorite place to take my used Mini Cooper - Derek was completely consultative , the techs and mechanics are great, and they take the necessary time and "dude diligence" to find what's wrong underneath the hood. My engine had to be decarbed, because it was filled with carbon deposits from years of indifference and taking the previously used vehicle to the wrong service places using cheap oil products. Also my spark plugs needed to be replaced and Derek pointed that out. Basically from an end-to-end view they took care of me, and I will be back for my struts work at a later time, because it was costly to do all the needed service work in one shot! Awesome work and great value for my Mini!

Excellent plumbing service - I recommend them and they got the job done when I was in a bind with my two master bedroom vanity sinks that needed a drain plug replacement. These guys are 100% reliable and dependable and even gave me knowledge about some of the other plumbing stuff in the house - free plumbing advice, that's invaluable!!!! How about that? I would definitely hire them again, make sure you do for any small , less complex plumbing work that you can't DIY. For the more expensive complex jobs, make sure you check prices with other to obtain a more competitive quote. Belsito pricing can be a little bit steep for the more complex projects.

Love the food in this place. Service not the best, but I still give the food quality a decent eating. I believe we waited longer than most to get our food and our server's attention- this is more of a training issue for them, I would surmise.

Good doctors, optometrist - the resident optician was not a salesperson as well, either. Focused on my needs and laid out the options for my Oakley specs pretty well. I'd definitely recommend them for professionalism , competence and expertise.

Great thorough job performed by my assigned tech, Joshua Ropper.  He did a fantastic job and followed-through with spraying all the pests and leaving traps for both the roaches and scorpions that have been found inside the house and within my garage.  Will definitely subscribe to the monthly Bulwark pest control service.  This is a great company- they go the extra mile- 5 Star AAAAA rating!!!

Gerald does not return phone calls regularly and only text messages intermittently at his own discretion. Poor customer service skills, all I had were several inquiries for service and he was very selective on his intermittent text responses. I would not recommend his service based on first impression - dealing with him may be a waste of your time, money and resources. I suggest you go with a more hands-on pool guy who can return calls individually at least and has the scale to respond with excellent customer service skills.

This was our 2nd attempt at this restaurant. The place has a good ambiance, our server was friendly and there is absolutely no issue with that. The environment and staff suffers though from a lack of training - on relationship management and courtesy. All the interactions were brief and as if our server was too busy to take any time and explain the menu to us, or interact because I had taken out my brother-in-law, his wife and my wife there.  In addition, the meals were tasty and I had a great Moscow mule for $10 and the short ribs for $25. My wife ordered the bolognese dish with a Petit Syrah which she liked. Prior to that, we had a trio of bruschetta which wasn't bad but may have had slightly undercooked ingredients. The other two in our family  ordered pasta dishes. Needless to say, my wife and I were not very impressed with the size and portions for the price- $178 for 4 people(nearly $50 total per head) after the tip!

Fast and friendly service - poor quality and freshness of nigiri. I try not to be too critical on reviews but if your signature sushi nigiri is partially bloody on your cut (a big no-no), you are the Yellowtail chef and it is sent back without a reason, you should follow-up to it and either replace it or provide a reason for it. The rolls on the other hand are pretty decent and quite flavorful but extreme on the spiciness level- the spicy tuna on the Hawaiian roll , for example. Overall, this place gets a 2-star rating in my view. We came here on a Sunday evening and the service was quick (we were the only customers) but follow-ups and interactions were so-so.

Blown away by how great the BBQ here is as well as the food service/quality. Had their brisket (which is moist and delicious), half-chicken, ribs and even got some Rudy's sauce to go- it's an amazing marinade!

Best haircut in Glendale-- I have been to other barbers as well.  Johnny B's know how to give you a good head/neck massage, steam shave and taper- these are long lost art forms that are traditional to the art but relaxing and helps stress.  This also shows you that they have quality and know how to take their time.  It's not a farmed out process, where they "churn and burn" customers- each haircut I have gotten there is a quality job. Ask for Mike, he is my favorite barber over there.

These guys did a phenomenal job on repairing my HTC One. The glass was cracked after a single drop, and they recommended it would take a few days after the part had been ordered. I followed-up with them the next week after leaving my phone with them and they took care of it within a day. Admire the craftsmanship and care that they took into fitting the glass back in and running tests after the replacement has been made. My HTC is back and running like it was brand new- and I didn't have to deal with a more expensive upgrade in order to get my service working again! Thanks to the team at ubreakifix!

Fantastic work- had Lenny find the Swiss part and have my Tag Heuer battery replaced within a day for an affordable price. Better alternative than going to the mall- but be prepared to bring cash because it is a Russian business! :)

Best place for steak, cocktails and regardless of how infrequent our server visited us for drink refills and request, the experience was zen like for the food! That is the major differentiator for this place, I am a foodie and a steak lover and this place had amazing steak. We resolved the service issue by talking to the head manager and then we were attended to hand and foot.

Favorite new coffee joint - friendly atmosphere, great epicurean taste and breakfast menu, and amazing cappuccinos and prompt service. I had a dirty chai and vegetable quiche and it was probably the most flavorful quiche I have ever had. I'll go there again many times as it is a work-friendly environment, and I don't like the noise at Starbucks.

Favorite bar in North Central PHX - bar none! Great service, people and vibe. Most importantly, it's a community bar.

Great haircut, friendly staff. This franchise  is consistently quality and service-oriented in every location I've been to thus far. I'm glad it's attracted really cool people as well. They really seek to serve you in every way possible and are extremely friendly. Most importantly, they earn your business every single time.
