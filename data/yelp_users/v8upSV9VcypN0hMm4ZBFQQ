I also purchased a Groupon before reading the bad reviews, but I had a great experience. Even though they did not answer my first call, they returned my call within an hour and I was scheduled for the next week, the time that I needed.  Brittany was extremely nice and I did not feel embarrassed or intimidated. I got a lot of information and find it useful. She did offer me a package, but I politely refused and there was no pushing to buy it.  I recommend this place.

The only reason I am giving this 2 stars and not 1 is because the food was good. However, it is highly overpriced for what it is and the service is horrible. I did not care for the atmosphere of the place, considering the prices they charge, it is more of an eatery than a nice restaurant.  I went there with a family for a private event for which they had a limited menu. We got there early before it was filled and asked if it would be possible to order from the regular menu since my husband was on a strict diet and my kids did not want the poboy sandwiches. The first person said it would not be a problem and that they could grill either fish or chicken for him instead of deep-frying it. When our actual waitress came, she said that that was not possible, although she did order chicken tenders for kids.  My husband ordered carbonated water to drink and then asked for a refill. After we got the bill, he was charged for the water $2.20 each time (even the refill)! This was truly an insult--charging for water and then charging to refill it on top! Needless to say, we are not stepping foot in that place ever again.
