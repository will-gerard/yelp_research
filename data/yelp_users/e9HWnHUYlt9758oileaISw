One of the few fusion Japanese/Italian places in town that is actually decent quality (relatively far and few in Phoenix compared to California). The restaurant itself is quite small and seating is limited, but it is worth the wait.  My personal favorite if you are a fan of Udon noodle soup is the Udon Suki Iron Pot. The broth is very flavorful, udon perfectly slurpable, beef a little bit too lean but mixes well, and the egg totally rocks it.   Zaru Soba is a cold noodle dish that i have ordered and is quite good. it's not much on the dish besides the buckwheat noodle and you dipping it in the Soba soy sauce. Nice refreshing starch.  Sushi is ok but I would stick with the rice and noodle dishes.  The menu is quite extensive so I'll definitely return often to try out all the other options.  Definitely recommend this place as a solid lunch option for a reasonable price.

In my opinion, one of the neatest restaurants in the valley that doesn't get enough pub. Yeeeehaw!!  Located on the top of a little hill in the middle of the Point, you get a great view of the valley. This is a Western style eatery, with a real bull sitting outside pretty much every night. Gives it the "authentic" smell i guess. When you enter, you can decide to choose the "fun" entrance, which is sliding down this slide instead of walking down the stairs! haha...I loved that, definitely makes you feel like a little kid again.  There's a nice live band playing on most of the nights, so pretty lively place. When you get to your seat, it's in these traditional wood benches. Along the floor, you have the typical western style hay thrown about. Nice touch to it.  Their menu selection is the classic Western food. If you are adventurous, I recommend trying the Deef Fried Rattlesnake as a starter. They actually serve the meat in a different portion and bring out the entire ribs of the snake, which is also deep fried. Meat is nothing too unique, just a tad bit chewy, however very neat presentation.  The rest of the menu is pretty standard Western food: steak, beans, etc. After a hearty meal, I recommend standing outside the patio (when the weather is cooler) and enjoy the view of the valley.    If you are looking for really high quality food, you probably won't come here as the price is pretty steep for just decent western food. However, this place gets excellent ratings for the atmosphere. Perfect place to take any guests that visits the Valley for the first time.

Oh boy! Where do I start? First off, it was 110 in the middle of summer, and they didn't even bother to turn on the AC, only had fans on (#1 big no no, especially given the nice area of Scottsdale). I saw the thermostat say 92 inside!!!!!   Secondly, their menu selection is pretty limited. Just Pho Bo, Pho Ga and a few of their so-called Banh Mi.  I ordered their Pho Bo. Soup was totally bland, the meat was really dry (actually come to think of it, there were barely any beef in it!). Prices were pretty expensive too.  I also tried their pork Banh Mi sandwich. Boy what a mistake, the bread crumbled, the sauce too sweet, the pork was dry. There was no pate in it whatsoever, definitely not an "official Banh Mi".  This place does not do Viet Cuisine justice. It is totally catering to the Non-asian taste.  I would recommend going to Da Vang, Khai Hoan for a good hearty bowl of Pho.

I'm not a big fan of french cuisine, but Zinc is pretty good.  We had their oxtail entree. There was not as much taste to it, not as flavorful as how the Chinese make it. Not sure if that's supposed to be how French makes the oxtail, or just so happen the one we got.  The interior is very nice though, plenty of tables and very well thought out decorations.  Prepare to pay quite a bit (since it is after all a French place).

Ugh. There are far better sushi places in Phoenix for the same price that you need to pay here.  First off, if you are looking for Shabu Shabu, I would not recommend it here. Our server was completely unhelpful, and seemed so impatient trying to explain how the Shabu Shabu works. The more questions we asked, the more annoyed she became. Definitely big red flag already!  Basically in the menu, Shabu Shabu only offers you 1 option. Thinly sliced beef with assorted veggies (some greens, noodles, mushrooms). All this for $30!!!!  When we got the dish, I was shocked at how lean the meat was. The cut was no good at all, I felt like I was at some cheap chinese buffet getting ready to eat at the Mongolian BBQ grilling station.  The veggies were alright, but I felt the broth was a bit too salty.  We ordered some sushi too, but didn't feel that unique to me.  I was quite disappointed in this restaurant, given the fact that it's in such a nice area of town.

I'm not a big fan of this place cause the price is too much for a basic milk tea (almost 4$)!!!! The milk tea is too sweet too.  The setting is nice though, as there are quite a bit of tables for everyone. Nice decorations with their wide assortment of tea on the shelves for display.  I'll take Quickly over this anytime.

For anyone who has not been here, please show up on a Tuesday so you can try their amazing tacos first hand. The location will make you worry initially, but do not be afraid, it is very cozy and clean inside!! It's got your standard bar seating along with an abundance of seating areas around the restaurant.   The green salsa is amazing, my coworker and I can always down a bottle and a half in one sitting. It has wonderful kick to it and the texture is just perfect. You'll be munching more chips than you ever imagine (and this is before your order comes in). You can also buy the bottle of salsa to take home if you can't have enough of that goodness.  Taco Tuesdays has $1 tacos (grounded or shredded beef) and $2 coronas. Do not be afraid of eating more than 5!!! It is that good.   I've also tried their Chicken Mole enchiladas and their chimichanga. Pretty good size for the price and quite tasty.   The staff there is very friendly and will engage in good conversation with you (even when they are swamped with customers on a Tuesday). Shoutout to Jose/Luce! You guys are da bomb.  All in all, very reasonably priced mexican food and consistent. A little jewel on Camelback Rd that should be discovered by anyone that enjoys Mexican food.

I think this pho place has been the most consistent one in the entire Phoenix metropolitan area in my opinion. I've been going to this one for at least 8 years now and hasn't disappointed me. They don't mess around. Decor is the usual dumpy looking asian restaurant, where you need to walk into the kitchen to get to the toilets. However, the Pho is fantastic here. Price is very reasonable, you can get a large bowl of Pho Bo Dac Biet for under $7. Very generous on the meat, tendon and veggie. The beef is very tender, the broth is very flavorful (not too salty, not too bland, not MSG tasting) and the right amount of fresh veggies (basil, bean sprouts, lime, mint).Their spring rolls are also very well done, and the peanut sauce is to die for!   The service is very fast and polite servers.   This place is very popular among the college crowd due to the close proximity to Arizona State University. Definitely should give it a shot if you have never been to this Pho place, you won't be disappointed.

This buffet is overrated. Went to the $35 brunch a few years ago, decor of eating area was quite plain to say the least, compared to some of the other buffets around Vegas (ie: Paris, Rio).  When i first walked in, the first item i saw was...Asian CONGEE?? What the heck?!!! In asian countries like China, Congee is seen as cheap street food. Here its actually one of the featured stations. Totally lame...  All the other brunch items were nothing out of the ordinary that you could not find at a cheaper buffet.  Not worth the money. If there is one buffet in Vegas that really kicks butt, it's the Rio World seafood buffet. Money well spent there and good food!

Drive in movie theaters are a dying breed, but I had a great time watching Toy Story 3 with my wife here recently.  Excellent price ($6.50 for a new movie can't be beat by any of the big movie chains), great family activity. Only downside of drive in theaters in Phoenix is that its pretty dead during the hottest months between May-September. Hope this theater holds up, as there's not too many of these around the country anymore.

I love this Chinese restaurant. Being raised in a Cantonese household, I would claim myself to have quite a high standard for Chinese food as we eat pretty much every variety of Cantonese dieshes.  From the outside you would never guess it's a Chinese restaurant as it doesn't have any Chinese characters on the sign. All too many times, most of the so-called "Chinese" restaurants in Phoenix are way too Americanized so I hesitated when I first saw this restaurant. However, I found out about this restaurant from the Phoenix Asian newspapers and decided to give it a shot.  Inside, it's definitely not the best looking restaurant around, but it is a decent setting. One thing you'll notice about this restaurant, which is very much like some of the good LA chinese restaurants is that they highlight their signature dishes on the wall via nice full colored images.  The service was pretty decent and seems like most of the staff there (cook/servers) spoke Cantonese, so at least it makes the restaurant feel more authentic. The service was very fast too, had a nice Hong Kong feel to it.  The menu has the trademark selection of classic Hong Kong Style menu items, easy to read menu with pictures and both English/Chinese writing. Tons of clay pot items, meats, fish, soup, stir fry items. I ordered the walnut shrimp w/ mayo, beef chow fun, Salted Fish with chicken fried rice. Those are usually my favorite dishes to order at any of the restaurants to test their culinary skills. For people who know a little about Cantonese cooking, the importance of the WOK determines if the food is good or not. Usually if the restaurant has a powerful enough stove with a good quality wok, you can tell the difference in the taste of the food.  When I got the items, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. The food was seasoned just right, not too salty. The Walnut Shrimp was pretty decent size, the sauce was not too thick and not too sweet, just right. You can taste the freshness of the shrimp as it had that nice texture to it.  The beef chow fun was a pretty good dish. Beef could've been a bit more "fluffy", but still pretty moist compared other places in Phoenix. It was a pretty generous amount. The seasoning on the noodle and beef was a little light for my taste, but still pretty good as the noodles were not too soft and not too tough.  The salted fish rice was a very big plate. The salted fish was cut just small enough and the shreds of chicken was perfect compliment to the dish. This was among my favorite dish.  Back to the WOK thing, you can tell this place had some really good WOK action cause all the food came out real hot, and the texture of the food had all of the fresh "STIR FRY" element to it that you can't get from a regular pan.   I've been back many times and definitely very satisfied. I'd probably caution any folks reading this review is that it is still not at the level of Hong Kong or LA, etc, but for Phoenix, it outperforms its competition by a long shot.

If you are a fan of yummy, juicy, unhealthy burger, then this is the place to go!  My favorite is the A1 Peppercorn burger. The patty is made to your liking (I like mine Medium). When you bite into the burger, you bite into a little bit of heaven. Make sure to add their "secret" Red Robin spice to the burger, it totally enhances the flavor. Although this gourmet burger place is a "chain", it definitely doesn't feel like a chain quality.  Along with their burgers, they offer free bottomless steak fries. They are fried to perfection and will fill you up quick.  Average price is about $8-10 for the burgers, but it includes the unlimited fries, so it's a pretty decent deal. Definitely bang for your buck if you come here.  Be sure to sign up for their e-club too as you get a free meal on your birthday!

Finally! A well priced chinese cafe style place in Phoenix that is actually good!!!!!  To start off, don't expect a fancy setting or anything. It's straight up, no frillz asian style cafe decor. It's in an excellent location as it is across from the Mekhong Plaza, however, it's kind of hidden inside this plaza so you would have to look hard for it.  When you enter, you have all of their featured menus plastered on the wall. Awesome- shows nice pictures of the dish, name and price of it. It's good for folks who may not be familiar with certain dishes and would like a picture of what they are ordering.  The 1st thing that caught my eye was the Hong Kong menu. They actually served FRIED MILK!!!! For all those that wonder what the heck is fried milk, it's basically solidified milk and then they use flour to coat around the milk and fry it. It is a really interesting dish, probably not for everyone as the taste is probably more of an acquired dish. This dish however is really complex to make, so I was somewhat sceptical that they can make Fried Milk at this cafe. When the order came in, I was really surprised by the quality of it. The flour was not too thick, the milk inside was still soft enough and when you bit into it, the flavored gushed into your mouth. I loved it! Dip the fried milk into the sweet mayo dip and you have a winner!  I also ordered another great dish, Smooth beef with egg over rice. Their beef was perfectly fluffy ( I can tell they use the Baking Soda to soften up the meat first as the texture of it is very uniquely soft) and the thick white sauce with egg white was the perfect mixture over the rice. This dish was cheap, only $6 for such a large dish.   Their entire menu was generally from $5-9, so lot's of options to choose from. I am very happy to know this place exists and that Phoenix is slowly getting up to speed to the Los Angeles Chinatown quality.  Highly recommend this cafe if you want some good sized asian food at a budget price!

This place is super duper succulent!!!  Their homemade Hot N Juicy sauce is the star of the menu. I love their shrimp/ crawfish dipped in the sauce. All the orders come per pound.  It is just mouth watering when you suck out the juice from your seafood. Great simple concept, decor is plain, table cloth, bib all made of plastic. You eat, you dirty up the place and they just need to throw out the entire set. Brilliant idea, no BS...  I also recommend ordering their soft shell crab and add an extra side of sauce to dip that in.  Be prepared for huge lines, especially on weekends.  And #1 tip: Don't wear a white shirt!  Overall, must eat place when you visit Las Vegas.

One word: Butter burger!  The burger patties are grilled in butter, so you get this really sensational flavor out of it. My favorite is the bacon butter burger, with a side of fries and drink.  Fries are regular, nothing special about them.  They also serve other meals like fried chicken, fried cod, etc. So nice alternative if you are not in the mood for a burger.  Their dessert section is also pretty good, the concrete mixers are nice and creamy, not too sweet, and pretty reasonable price compared to other ice cream places like Cold Stone.  The setting is very much like a semi-restaurant style, with seating out in the patio or inside. They also have TVs for you to watch while eating there.  It seems that Culveers likes to open their locations at the more outskirt areas of town, such as Deer Valley, Cave creek Road near the Loop 101, and their east Mesa location. I hope they expand to more populous areas of Phoenix so that other folks can experience the beauty of the butter burger!!

So my wife and I stumbled upon this little restaurant while we were shopping in the Tatum area. We took a look at the menu, and saw the wide variety of food served with very reasonable prices, so what the heck let's give it a shot1  The decor is nice and cozy, they have alot of classic americana type portraits hanging on the wall. The restaurant space is kind of small, but it's a nice change from all the super sized restaurant chains. They had some nice music playing in the background, probably more jazzy than anything.  My wife ordered the Shrimp Scampi ($12), and I ordered the Jerk Chicken with sauteed potatoes and green beans ($11). When our dishes came, it was in a very presentable manner, had the look of a very expensive dish.  The Shrimps in my wife's pasta was amazingly fresh and large. The white sauce they used was a bit more liquid than the usual shrimp scampi, but that's probably due to their use of heavy cream. It was a nice touch to it I must say, the flavor of the sauce was not overpowering. It had a nice balance between the pasta and the seafood.  For my dish, there was a generous amount of jerk chicken, with the side of green bean and sauteed potatoes. I'm not a big fan of chicken breast, as I find the meat too tough, however, in this dish, it was delightfully moist and juicy! The jerk could've been a bit spicier, but it was a nice taste as it had a scrumptious tomato based sauce with the jerk spice and peppers. The green beans were fresh and crunchy, while the potatoes had the perfect crispy skin and moist inside.  I would definitely like to try their dinner in the future. Probably would love to try their Creme Brulee (apparently it has banana lined up at the bottom with chocolate!!!!)   It's a nice little treasure in the Cactus/Tatum area that should be explored!

Bleh. This place sucks.  Ordered the Pho Bo. Soup was really bland, almost like drinking clear water and the beef was dry. On top of that, the "LARGE" size would be a small at other more casual Pho place. This is definitely one of the more Americanized Vietnamese eateries in Phoenix.   If not for their 50% grand opening discount on all dishes ( even though it's been open for so many months now), I probably wouldn't consider trying this place as the base price is over 7$ for the large Pho.  There are more decent places out there, such as Khai Hoan in Tempe.

It's good to finally see a food place making hand pulled noodles. That is definitely one of the more artistic things around in cooking, using their hands to make different noodle thickness in less than 20secs.  This place is not that big, but decent size enough for a casual restaurant. I like their variety of soup noodles, stir fry and appetizers. For appetizers, they have my favorite marinated beef tendons. That's a nice dish, as it has some spice to it and nice and chewy. They also have some classic HK dishes like the mantou gok.  . As for the soup noodle, their bowl size is not the biggest, but the flavoring was pretty good. I liked the ox-tail soup with the hand pulled noodle.  Overall nice change to the chinese food scenery in Phoenix. Glad to see we are getting more LA style variety and not the cookie cutter dim sum places and chop suey.

Primebar is an awesome addition to the North Scottsdale Quarters area.   Their Happy Hour menu is truly the star. Superbly priced food ($5) for dishes like the bbq chicken flat bread (fave), calamari (fave), steak quesadillas, sliders, etc...Just can't beat the selection. The portions are pretty big too, you can get full on 2 Happy hour dishes easily.  During the weekend nights, the place comes alive with a live band. Only gripe I had was on Saturday night (few weekends ago), it was jam packed with people, but I barely felt the Air Conditioning. Felt like a sauna in there, which usually isn't the case during the happy hours on the weekdays.  But overall, fun place to chill. Great atmosphere, nice loungey chairs, plenty of tv's to watch sports.With close proximity to the H&M store and the rest of the Kierland area, this is definitely among my faves for Happy Hour in the North Scottsdale area.

Wow, didn't know what to expect initially. Once we entered, we were blown away. It was probably one of the classier Sports restaurant I've seen. Ron Wolfley really put a great touch to this place. There were nice booths, nice high top tables, a big bar, and about 5-6 very large flat screens to watch all of your favorite sports.  When the menu was handed to us, I was blown away. $18 for a 14oz aged ribeye? Sign me up! We ordered that dish, plus a Wild Jack burger.  Once the dish came, we quickly dug into the ribeye. Wow! It was cooked to perfection, excellent seasoning, and was super moist. There were an abundance of sides to choose from, we chose onion rings. Apparently they also gave brocolli and the shredded onion strips.   On to my burger, what else can I say? It had everything you wanted for a burger, nice sized patty, perfect taste when you bit into it, excellent mix of spiciness with the jalapenos and jack cheese. I had excellent waffle fries as my side. Yum yum yum.  We were pretty full after the meal obviously, as we totally underestimated the large portions.  I must say, this restaurant had pretty "high end" menu selection for reasonable prices. They even had lobster ravioli for about $12.99,  some pasta, wide selection of pizza, good selection on wine and drinks.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to any sports fans and families who enjoy a higher end setting for pretty reasonable prices. Hope I can meet Mr. Wolfley next time and get a signature from him:)

Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.  When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular "Chinese" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.  Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.  Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.  Our "Har Gow"/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.  The trademark "beef internal organs" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon.   The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.  I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too.   I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.

Wow! This newly opened little food shop in the Mekong Plaza is fantastic. Very authentic Hue Food. Although I'm not a Vietnamese, I have been to Hue in Vietnam and had their famous Bun Bo Hue. Must say that this store was very close to the authentic Bun Bo Hue. The pork hock and the other meat used was very tender, the noodle was perfect. The broth is lightly flavored so that you can use the Shrimp Paste for those who like it a bit more salty. The veggie was very generous.  The Banh Beo was another neat Hue snack. It's a very thin rice cake snack which is steamed. You dip it in Fish Sauce. It was very nice and moist.  Their menu is pretty limited as they only have about 6-7 items, but they are definitely featuring the best of hue to serve. Very impressed to see.  There was a good crowd too, so lot's of people have been dying for some nice Hue food.  Only thing to note is they were a bit disorganized the opening weekend as their register was not even working, and the service was a bit slow. I'm sure after a few weeks, this place will be running smoothly.

This buffet is much better than the location on Ray Road. It's a pretty big standalone building near Chandler mall area, and has some nice exterior decoration to look quite "Chinese".  Interior design was alright, nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely more presentable than other buffets in the valley.  I was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of the food they had. For a chinese buffet, they really put a lot of thought into the dishes they made, and not just stick with the trademark cheap chinese buffet dishes like sweet and sour pork.  The stuffed scallops, sashimi, squids were the highlights in my opinion. Flavoring was excellent and they kept their food fresh and warm at all times.  I hope this place holds up as it is in a great location and have a very big building. Price is very reasonable too, great value!  I highly recommend.

Don't be fooled by its location in a tiny strip mall. This is an amazing Mediterranean restaurant at a very reasonable price. The shawerma fries were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, but be aware, the portion is very large so prep your appetite! Their pitas are freshly baked and hummus home made, so that is another must have when you go there.  It may be a tad bit quiet on the weekdays for lunch but believe me they don't skimp on the quality even when there are not as many customers. This place is a hidden treasure and deserves to be discovered by all those who loves good Mediterranean food.
