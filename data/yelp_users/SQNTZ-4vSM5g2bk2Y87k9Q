Don't count on the bartenders acknowledging you unless you are sitting at the bar. I watched two seats at their bar remain dirty and empty for 20 minutes.  Like they are too good to clean it. They weren't even that busy.

I have been here for 45 minutes waiting for a mani while my Mom has been getting her toes done. They really need to tell you how long it's going to be so they don't waste your time.  This has been nothing but a waste of my time.  I'm glad they are busy, I want the local businesses to be successful, but not at the expense of my time.

They are now closed. Reading past reviews, I'm not surprised.

Mayo is amazing. The price is very reasonable and the benefits are wonderful. I started coming here over a year ago and the level of care you get here is truly amazing. Mayo spends time with you, discussing what brought you to acupuncture in the first place. She is an incredible listener and really cares about each person who comes to her business. I love how she has made her location a sanctuary and oasis for restorative healing. And if you are afraid of needles, don't be. They are small and she is an expert. You'll feel better from the instant you are done. Love this place!!

So much fun. Exercise while you drink. Bike thru downtown Scottsdale and your like an instant celebrity! People waving at you and taking photos. So much fun!  They have a deal right now, sign up for it! What a great experience!

Worst service. Our server was a blond girl with long blond hair that was a little curly. I would post her name, but she never introduced herself to us. My husband waited while I was in the bathroom for five minutes for the waitress came over to take our order for drinks.   She was terrible. When she finally took our order, she ordered his beer incorrectly.  She never ran any of our food out, the place was not busy to warrant using a food runner, and when she brought the check, she didn't ask if we needed any change and didn't bring change back to us until we flagged her down and asked.  Lastly she didn't ask or offer us any bags for our to go boxes.   After all of this, the food was ok, but overpriced. I won't go back.  I'll just wait 6 months for it to close down and try the next restaurant that goes in.

Adam, the bartender (manager?) is a great restaurant employee. I wasn't the biggest fan of a small part of my salad. The eggplant was not very good. I ate the rest of my salad, (it was really good minus the eggplant).  Adam was concerned over my experience and offered solutions to make it better.  I left feeling good about my experience and will definitely go back.

Please wash the patio more often. There was food on the floor, it was sticky, and there were flies everywhere.  It was so embarrassing having a drink with my parents who are older and watching them try to hang out and have a conversation and do nothing but swat flies for an hour and a half.  And our server handed us our food and drinks over the brick wall ledge in the lounge area yesterday instead of walking around and placing it on our table.   I got up out of my seat to get the plates and napkins he brought and my Mom had to turn around and get their chips and guacamole.

The patio has really turned around. The inside is always well maintained and it's nice to see that attention has been given to the patio area as well. It looks like it gets cleaned up more often now so look out summer patio dining, here I come!  The staff is friendly and prompt and the chips and guac, or hatch chili burger are great.  That and $5 pitchers during happy hour make this a great local hang out. Trivia nights on Saturday are a lot of fun too, but look out for the "wild and crazy guy" he usually wins every time.

This place is really cute and clean. The menus on the flat screens are nice.  The food was ok. Our fish taco shells fell apart, and our fried fish wasn't that crunchy. The shrimp quesadilla was made with corn tortillas not flour, which is different , but not great. I hope they take these comments and make changes I would love to come back and try them again.

My husband went there last night to buy me a birthday cake.  He showed up just before closing time because it was a work day and he was coming home from work.  He told me he wouldn't got back, he felt rushed and treated poorly when he was asking questions about the cake he wanted.  He asked if they had individual candles and was told no, (but they sell individual candles with the cake pops.) Also, the employee wouldn't write happy birthday or anything on the cake because of the scalloped icing.    I called today and spoke with Lisa who identified herself to me as the owner.  I can see why her employee behaves the way they did towards my husband.  Lisa did not identify herself to me when she answered the phone.  I had to ask for her name after she said she was the owner.  I told her that my husband received poor service last night.  Lisa did apologize and tell me that was sorry he felt rushed.  But the rest of the conversation was short and came off as very non caring.  I can't say we'll go back to this shop.  AJ's down the street on Camelback has the same products, accommodates requests like writing on the cakes, (they will pace a ribbon over the cake so a name or saying can be written on it if the cake itself won't allow for that.)  And with much friendlier customer service too.
