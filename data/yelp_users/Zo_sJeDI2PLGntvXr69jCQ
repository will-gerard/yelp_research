Spent the evening playing golf and arcade games. Had a wonderful time till nature called and I had to use the restroom. I used the upstairs restroom and I'm pretty sure half of castles and coaster could see me through the large gap between the door and the stall. Talk about no privacy.

So very disappointed with Spinatos pizzeria. It used to be one of my favorite spots until tonight. We had a large group of 12 with us and right off the back they didn't take reservations. The lady on the phone suggested that we get there 30 minutes prior to our scheduled meet up time to get a table for dinner. As soon as we got to the restaurant I spoke to the three hostesses who had to be at least 16 years old and talking about personal topics at the hostess stand, said that it would be and hour and forty five minutes wait.  I have never heard of such a long wait time. As we waited there, there were other people coming in after us with two groups of six, two groups of five and a group of four and all got seated right away. After about an hour wait and several annoying chats with the hostess, we asked to speak to a manager. The manager "Ransom" came to speak to us and we told him our issue. As soon as he responded, he clearly had a little attitude about how we felt. As soon as we called him out about the attitude he quickly denied it. He then told us he would work on getting us seated. It only took a few minutes for him to get us seats. I don't think the young hostess were properly trained. Walking through the dining room I noticed multiple tables available for seating, yet we were stuck outside standing and waiting for over and hour.   We sat down and right away got our drinks ordered. As soon as we got our drinks, we didn't see our waiter for several minutes. We noticed he was busy dealing with issues with other upset customers. One of our people had to wave down another waiter to take our order. With out hesitation Donna was kind enough to take on our group and get our orders in.  After serval attempts to get refills on our drinks. A friend had to get up and go to the bar and re fill a drink. After another long wait we finally got our food and all enjoyed the great pizza and calzones.  There were a few issues with the bills and all the split checks were wrong so Donna had to fix the checks several times which took even longer.   I have never been so happy to leave a place. Good food but horrible, unprofessional service and long wait times. We got there at 6:30pm didn't get seated till 8:00pm, didn't get food till after 9:30 pm and finally left around 10:15pm. Almost four hours of my life wasted.   Thank you to Donna for stepping up and taking care of us the best you could. Sadly I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.

This place is a really dirty. The people working very unfriendly and their tacos we're soaked in grease. I definitely won't be going back anytime soon.
