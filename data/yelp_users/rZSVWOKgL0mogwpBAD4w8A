We made reservations for 12 for dinner on a Sunday evening (12/20/15) after our wedding. We didn't tell them it was our wedding beforehand, but they figured it out quickly enough when I showed up in my wedding dress. The staff and managers treated us like royalty. We started out with a champagne toast. Our daughters were getting a little fussy and hungry, so they quickly brought out a snack for them while we were waiting on the rest of the meal. Everything was delicious. The presentation of the meals and desserts were outstanding. All around an excellent job and SO appreciated. They helped make our wedding day special. Thank you!

This isn't exactly the place you go to for great service - you go for cheap drinks and bar games. But in my book, downright rude service is a deal killer, no matter how cheap the drinks are.   I went in on a busy-ish night. Busy, but not standing room only. I went and sat down at the bar and ordered 2 drinks. The total came to an even amount ($5 I think). I don't know how anyone else does it, but when I am paying in cash and don't want to open a tab, I pay for the drinks when they are delivered, then leave the tip on the bar top right before I leave. Well, I order my drinks. The guy comes over and says "That'll be 5 dollars". So I pull out a 5-dollar bill and give it to him, once again, because I always leave a cash tip on the bar top before I leave, not at the same time I pay for the drinks. Well, he takes my 5 dollars, gives me a look and says "Oh, thanks for the exact change, sweetie. Thanks a lot!" and walks away. I was so floored that somebody would actually be that rude I just stood there staring at him, then put my drinks down and left.  Yes, it's cheap. Yes, they have giant games. But there are plenty of bars in Old Town that have cheap drinks and giant games. There isn't a single reason to settle for horrible service. Now when my friends suggest Giligin's - I pass and meet up with them at the next spot.

Kona's food is wonderful, and I love their cosmos! The service is pretty slow, which is my only complaint. Granted, I'm usually here during the dinner rush on Fridays and Saturdays, but even during regular and reverse happy hour it seems things have been taking awhile lately. But most of the wait staff is nice, and the managers are great too.  We usually get some sushi (all of it is good) or some potstickers for an appetizer. I like the flatbread pepperoni pizza and the chinese chicken salad for dinner. They have pretty good deals on drinks and starters during happy hour (until 7). Their pomegranate cosmos are delicious! And only 5 (or 5.50 maybe) during happy hour.

As with most chain restaurants, the main difference between different locations is the service. I love Chipotle, and it pains me to give them only 2 stars, but this location just isn't cutting it. I've been in for lunch quite a few times, and it's usually fine. My main complaint is with the phone, online, or fax orders.   The first time, I placed my order from my iPhone, and naively assumed all was well. I showed up to pick up my order, and the girl explained that their system was broken, and it didn't send my order. She said "this is all it printed" and held up a sheet of paper with my name and phone number on it. Okay, now I completely understand that my order was supposed to be on the piece of paper, but why didn't you just call? I would have been more than happy to repeat my order over the phone 45 minutes ago, so that it was ready when I got there, rather than standing here 5 minutes past my order time repeating it.  One time occurrence, I thought. So, round two. I placed my order online, waited 5 minutes, then called to ensure they received my order. They confirmed my order and the time, and assured me it would be ready. I arrive at my scheduled pick up time, say my name, and they go to check on my order. A moment later, they return, "it will just be a moment". I wait, and wait. I glance toward the back area, and it looks like they are making my order. I wait, and wait. And wait some more. Finally, they come out and hand me my bag, with a "Sorry for the SHORT wait" (they didn't emphasize SHORT, but I am). I glance at my clock, and I am now 17 minutes past my pick-up time. 17 minutes!!!! Meanwhile, the people who walked in the door behind me and went through the line are sitting down, halfway done with their meal. What was the point of ordering beforehand?  Will I go back to this Chiptole? Probably. But I'll only do it when I have plenty of time, and I definitely won't be pre-ordering.

The whole team at Dr. Lamb's office is awesome! I had all four of my wisdom teeth done. Dr. Lamb called later that day to follow up and make sure I was feeling okay. I had a little bit of pain on one side a few days later, and they were great about getting me in very quickly on my lunch break. Thank you!

They did an awesome job taking in my wedding dress - with a super fast turn-around! Only 5 days. It looked and fit great and prices are very reasonable. Thank you!

Visited this hidden gem on a Sunday night. The biggest downfall is that, if you are not familiar with PV mall, it is so hard to find! There are virtually no signs in the parking lot of the entire mall telling you where the theater is. The best way is to park on the bottom floor of the parking garage, and the closest entrance will lead you straight to the theater.   The prices are here are some of the cheapest around - and why pay more to see the same movie? When I was there I bought two hot dogs, a bottled water, and a large soda and only spent around $8. AWESOME compared to some of the bigger movie theaters.   Seats are comfy, usually isn't very crowded, and staff is friendly. Definitely recommended!

This is going to be quite brief, but I love Majerle's. Their Strawberry Fields salad is the BEST salad I have ever had in my life. And the service is always great. One day the bartender even gave me some extra pecans and dressing to take back to work to snack on. Love this place!

I love Morning Squeeze!   1) They serve breakfast even during lunch 2) Their Eggs Benedict is awesome 3) They have a dog-friendly patio 4) They have Gluten Free toast 5) Mimosas!  I've tried almost everything on the breakfast menu, and it's all yummy! Build your own breakfast sandwich, eggs benedict, omelets... All the waitresses have been great (I say waitresses and not wait staff because literally the only people who work there are women under 30. Not sure what that says about the owner.. But I digress). Good location, cute decor. I don't have a single complaint!

Noms. This place is an adorable local spot. We went for brunch on a Sunday morning. There was a short wait, but we got in pretty fast and service was excellent. I appreciate that they have gluten free banana pecan pancakes - so yummy! We all had something different - pancakes, scrambles, omelettes, french toast, burger - and we all loved our meal. TONS of food, I don't think anyone was able to finish theirs.   Only complaint would probably be that it's $2.50 for coffee. This isn't Starbucks. But everything else is well priced and delicious!

Very helpful when choosing furniture. I came about 3 times before finally deciding what I wanted, and they were very patient with me. Prices are very reasonable. I shopped around and they had a great selection for some of the lowest prices I could find.  Only downfall is I was told "about a week" for my furniture. I got half of it in 2 weeks, the other half in 4. But they delivered both to me for free and the delivery men were very nice and quick. All the furniture arrived in perfect condition and I couldn't be happier with my selection!

All of the instructors are awesome and each have a little bit of their own style. Even if you're new to hot yoga or new to yoga in general, this is a great studio. The instructors encourage you to go at your own pace and take breaks as needed. The sequence is the same every time you go, so you really get to focus on listening to your body and deepening your own practice. All of the instructors are super helpful and willing to stay after class and work with you on things. It's easy to get hooked on Sumits! Everyone is super nice, the instructors remember your name, the students compliment each other. It's a great yogi home :)

I agree with Christina that the garlic knots should really be called pizza donuts. Yummmmm.   They have some local beers on tap and a good selection in bottles (including Angry Orchard for the cider lovers and/or gluten free people).   We started with the knots (free from the Yelp offer - woo hoo!) and mild wings. I love wings and Classic Crust's did not disappoint! The sauce was perfect, and even though I usually don't like going too spicy, I feel like I could have done medium on these ones. The mild is very, very mild, but very good.   We had a spicy meatball pizza (minus the red pepper flakes) which was also delicious. It's definitely thin-crust pizza without being a crunchy crust. This particular pizza had a lot of ricotta on it, which my husband liked, but I wasn't the biggest fan.  We finished up with the Zepelini (sp?), which I'm pretty sure is the same bread as the garlic knots except fried a little bit more and covered in icing and powdered sugar. Which is amazing.  Overall, great service and great food! We'll be back :)
