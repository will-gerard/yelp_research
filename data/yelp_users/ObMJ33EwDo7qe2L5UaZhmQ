This place gets a 1 star because the server was nice besides that WOW We ordered the spinach artichoke Dip ( I have had at other applebees) It came out looking like someone dumped a can of Cream spinach in a bowl it didn't even have the cheese on top just green mush. The chips looked like the bottom of the bag and tasted like it to stale and super salty. I ordered the Chicken Penne it came out with mushy over cooked noodles with Alfredo thrown on top the chicken looked like scraps of a leftover plate. All I can say it Yuk. The bread was still frozen in the center. I have had this dish at other Applebees and it never looked or tasted like this one. My Husband got Fish & Chips ( We also have had at other Applebees) This one came out on a plate not a basket. The fish was a dark Brown color like it was fried in old grease and under the fish was a pool of yellow grease. The forgot the Fry's Haha they actual forgot the chip part of Fish & Chips. We called the server over and right away she knew what was wrong and stated she could tell the Fish was way to greasy. The Manager came over and just brushed everything off. I do not believe he tried to fix the situation. We did not want replacement food so we tipped the waitress because it's not her fault the Kitchen sucks and we left never to return. Applebees Surprise is off the list. Worst Applebees we have ever been to. You are better off with Burger King.

One of the best Mexican places around. The owner always greats you with a smile. Lately it has been kinda a hit and miss. But still good. Sunday Brunch is always fun.

Every time we order from here something is wrong. Pizza is cold. We ordered wings the had no sauce yea no hot sauce at all. You can't expect much from a chain pizza place but this location is horrible. The service woah it's like you are asking them to much to correct your order.

I'm a big Trader Joe shopper. Love the prices and you just have to know what to buy. Customer service lacks but I still enjoy the store.

One of the kindest doctors I have seen. Dr Newman listen and cares he does not pretend to care HE CARES. I could not have picked a better obgyn to deliver my baby. This has been a hard pregnancy and has listened and helped the whole way.

Was very impressed! The outside does not look like much but the inside was very clean and cute. I had a couple different Rolls and both were super fresh and tasty. My fiancé does not eat sushi and had a beef teriyaki and again was surprised was great. If looking for a great sushi place in surprise this place is great.

Dr. Borlongan is a amazing doctor that being said his staff is horrible. The girls up front never smile and it's almost like you are bothering them when you come in. His nurse is just as bad NO PEOPLE SKILLS. The nurse giving my very young son shots was so rough and doesn't care about your concerns. I tried to stay with this office because we loved the doctor so much but in the end it was not worth having to deal with his staff. I had a appointment for my son today for shots and could not bring myself to bring him in I could not see him getting shots from someone who could careless about how he feels. I hope the doctor sees soon that he needs to do a complete staff change. It makes or breaks a office. I called a new office and the girl on the phone was a breath of fresh air so kind and made sure to explain everything. I am sad to leave such a good doctor but this is my child and want him to grow with his pediatric office and this was not happening.

I would give 5 stars but the nurse Curry was beyond rude. We asked him to leave the room and have another nurse take over are care. The nurse that took over was awesome the front desk guy was awesome. The doctor Dr. Dean A+ wonderful caring knowledgable man that understood and explained everything I can not say enough good things about him. I will not give a bad rating just for one nurse. But that nurse was past and beyond rude. But after he was replaced everything was very good. Thank you Dr. Dean for listening and helping my husband.

I would give ZERO or negative 10. Wow this company is horrible. They cancelled my service 3 times (human error) before it was even installed. I thought I was losing my mind. Day of install they never showed I called they say we tried to call you to verify the account and could not reach you so your account was put on hold. THEN THIS IS THE KICKER while trying to verify ( rudest lady I ever heard on the phone) She tells me someone is reading me this information and they have red flags it's not me wtf states I would have to send in my social and ID. I asked to speak to the manger and could hear them making fun of me in the back by this point I said refund my money I no longer want the service haha she states a have to call another number for that. What a joke and a waste of my time and nerves. STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE.

We have wanted to try this place for awhile. Yuk I can't even say it was american Mexican sad to say we would have been better with Taco Bell. The service was poor and the enchilada sauce tasted like cheap canned sauce. We love a good taco shop this is not it. My fiancé says they should be arrested for pretending to be a authentic Mexican place lol. The shredded beef chimichanga woah they fried the lettuce in the burrito. Never again
