My Sister's Attic Doesn't Want my Mother's Curtains.  I could not wait to get home to write this review. Despite their catchy billboards ("Sell your sole"), and the poor man on the side of 20th and Camelback holding a sign that said "Up to 90% off retail prices", I was disappointed with the overall experience at My Sister's Attic, as well as the prices. I've been there before, usually just to browse and see if they're recently obtained anything from anyone with really good taste (like mine, of course). This time was different, though. I went with a purpose.   My mom had these cute curtains that I must have complimented her on the last time I was in Florida, because wouldn't you know just a couple months after my visit, she sends me a package with the curtains. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that right now I don't really have anywhere to put them. So, after much deliberation about the moral soundness of trying to make some cash off of a gift (hey, I'm unemployed right now. Go easy on me), I decided that I would take them to My Sisters Attic. And if you tell my mom about this, I will deny, deny, deny.   I looked around a bit, and then headed over to the counter with my bag o' curtains and waited for help. And waited a bit more. Soon, a blond woman walks toward the counter with some crystal pieces in her hands. She looks at me and smiles. And keeps walking. She proceeds to a shelf at the front of the store where she puts the crystal ware on a display and continues to ignore me.   Using my best shot at ESP, I start to wonder if there's a different counter for taking in items as opposed to selling them. Yup. Right there tucked away in the back corner of the store, with a sign on an 8  1/2 x 11 piece of paper identifying it as the "intake" area. There were two older ladies behind the counter there discussing some items as I walk up. But don't worry, because they didn't let my presence interrupt their conversation. Finally, I interrupt and ask if they took curtains, to which they said a gruff "no" and went right back to their business. I interrupted again to ask if they knew of anywhere else that might take curtains, only to be met with the same response. Of course.   I did notice some cute items while I was waiting around for help, but looking at the prices, I wasn't too impressed. Outside, they had a set of three barstools for upwards of $200, and I saw some cheap looking nesting tables inside for I think $50. They looked like they were bought at Ikea for probably less than that.   Anyhow, after my experience with Thing One and Thing Two, I wasn't much in the mood for shopping. So I left the store, and on my way out I couldn't help but shoot a snarky "Thank you!" at the first useless woman who didn't help me. Then as I passed her I competed my thought under my breath, "...for nothing".   The only reason I gave this place any stars at all is because they do have some cute things, although pretty overpriced, from what I could see. Also, they had a pamphlet on the counter (that would be the check-out counter, not the intake counter) on the Arizona Humane Society. I don't think any percentage of their proceeds actually go to the Humane Society. Another redeeming aspect, though: their website says that if items don't sell after 60-90 days, they are donated to non-profit foundations that benefit homeless pets and women's groups. And yes, you can get a receipt for Uncle Sam.

When I adopted my furry bundle of joy last year, I had pretty much everything I needed to be a good parent... except a good vet.  When I adopted Owen from the Maricopa County Animal Control Shelter, I was given a sample of food, some coupons, a disposable cardboard carrying case and a list of vets who participated in their program, in which your new family member could get a free check up.   Once we got home, I eenie-meenie-miney-moed my way through the list of "free first office visit" vets, and made an appointment. A couple days later, Owen and I were at a vet appointment that made me feel like I had taken my car in for an oil change, and the vet was trying to sell me all kinds of new parts. Thus began my quest for friendly referrals, which led me to Dr. Bracken.   I am a vibe person. I can read people immediately, and I am usually pretty right on. I took to Dr. Bracken immediately, as did Owen. Dr Bracken might be the cat whisperer, and from what I understand, he's just as great with other animals. He bonded with Owen, and even though you might have to wait a couple minutes to be seen,  you can rest assured knowing that Dr. Bracken will give your animal (or in some people's case, "child") the same undivided attention.   Call me the crazy cat lady, but when I take my cat to the vet, I feel like I am taking my child to the pediatrician, and with Dr. Bracken, you can tell that he understands that he is not just dealing with people's pets (or their car), but their family.

I must admit, I first decided to check out Furniture Affair because I used to drive by their billborad on my way to work every day, and I thought their ad was cute and catchy - a girl in a leopard-print dress laying upside down on a couch, with the text that says "being cheap isn't always a bad thing". Well, Furniture Affair, I couldn't agree more!  I was impressed by the size of the store, and the selection of furniture, which was in good condition, and home accessories galore. Rugs, comforters, lamps, framed wall prints, and of course a kids' section.   Although I didn't end up purchasing anything on my visit, I feel comfort in knowing that I stumbled upon one of Phoenix's bargain gems. Once I buy that new mansion, I know just the place to find everything I need to cheaply furnish it... in a classy way, of course.

Let me preface this by saying that I am not a Chinese food connoisseur. But I do love to have lunch over here whenever I'm on this side of town.   If you're looking for some gong bang for your buck, you've found it. The lunch servings are generous, and the prices are low. All lunch items come with these yummy fried won ton crunchy things, a cup of soup, fried rice, an egg roll, and of course, whatever you ordered. All meals - lunch and dinner- also come with hot tea.   I've been for both lunch and dinner, but I really recommend going for lunch if you're in the area, because it's just a great deal. And the selection is pretty wide, as well as vegetarian friendly.   My favorite thing here is their hot and sour soup. I had honestly never eaten soup at a Chinese food restaurant before Abacus, because they always grossed me out. But I love their hot and sour soup. It has just the right amount of hot and the perfect amount of sour. This soup even inspired me to try making it myself at home because I started craving it, but I live so far away.   Oh yeah, every meal also comes with free dessert: a fortune cookie  My last one said that I would start writing some great reviews. But I don't think you're really supposed to add "in bed" to the end of that one.

The boyfriend and I purchased a pre-owned vehicle at one of the Valley's Power auto dealers a few months back. Since it was pre-owned, we decided to get just about any warranty they offered - from the tires to the oil. And the great part is that we can take the car to any Power dealer for service.   Just a couple months ago, the oil light came on, so off we go to Power Cheverolet to get the oil changed... because it's covered under the warranty. Here's where the problem started: our (and by "our", I mean "the boyfriend's") car is not a Chevy. It's a Lexus. I'm pretty sure it's hard to get the two confused. But an oil change is an oil change, right? I mean, how hard can it be? Well, apparently the mechanic working on our car thought the same thing, so he changed the oil and rotated the tires and sent us on our way.   Driving home, we noticed that there was an odd and very distinct scraping noise every time we turned. This noise was a new development. Once we got home, I got out of the car, and it took me about two seconds to notice what went wrong. The Lexus is250 has larger tires in the back than in the front. This is not a subtle difference. I mean, if I can notice it, I would expect a trained mechanic to notice... or at least know to look for it.   We immediately took the car back to the service department where they assured us that there had been no damage to any of the tires, and then they put all of the pieces of the puzzle back where they fit.   About a month later, the oil light comes on in the dash board again. Ummm, is this Groundhog Day? The boyfriend, being one of the most paranoid people I know, refused to drive the car until we knew exactly what was wrong with it. Too bad this occurred on a Saturday evening. A day and a half later, we bring the car back to the service department at the crack of dawn, and then wait about 30 minutes. Finally, the service manager comes in to explain the problem: we didn't realize that we had to reset the reminder in the computer system AND in the dashboard "until we read the owners' manual".   Oh. Em. Gee. Really? I'm not a mechanic, but if you're working on a car that you're not familiar with, wouldn't you immediately follow the instructions in the owners' manual? Or at least look on Wikipedia or something?   I wasn't disappointed that the mechanic wasn't familiar with our car, but I was pretty upset that he didn't have the sound mind to realize that he needed to ask for help, or look up some instructions. However, the manager was very apologetic. But in the long run, I don't think I'll be taking my (his) Lexus to a Chevy dealer for service any time soon. Even if it is under warranty.

"What? People still go to Blockbuster?" Yes, I may be the last person on Earth with a Blockbuster card...but not for long.   After a surgery, I was pretty much out of commission for a few days, so I had the boyfriend go to Blockbuster and pick up three DVD's. We don't yet have a Netflix account, and the boyfriend is apprehensive about using the Red Box contraptions because of an article he read about alleged debit card fraud. We do have an Apple box on which we can download movies, but we had workers in our condo, and were forced to stay in another unit temporarily. With only a smaller TV and a DVD player. This left us no choice but Blockbuster.  A couple weeks later, while walking home from dinner, we decided to make it a "Blockbuster night", and walked over to rent a DVD (and then, of course make our last stop at Total Wine before heading home). We finally agreed on a movie, and when we went to check out, we were rudely told that we owed a late fee of 48 cents because one of the three movies we rented was a day late. This is the part where you hear the screeching record followed by silence.   This is by no means about the 48 cents, but entirely about principle. First of all, Blockbuster, I seem to remember being bombarded with commercials cheerfully announcing the abolishment of late fees. You people were screaming it from the rooftops. I don't seem to recall any such publicity about the return of said late fee. Nor do I even remember even being told about it in the store. Discreetly.   And also, and even more aggravating, I returned all three DVDs at the same time. On time. In the middle of the day. So how just one could be checked in late is beyond me.   When I tell the stocky checkout boy of this, he looks at me in disbelief, as if I would lie about it to save myself less than half a dollar. He rolls his eyes, and spends a good couple minutes pounding away on his keyboard (a la the airline agent in "Meet the Parents"), and finally gives me my new total, sans late fee, as if he's just done me the world's biggest favor.   Then he makes sure to give me the receipt and personally go over the new Blockbuster pricing policies with me, as if I was a disobedient child who didn't listen the first time. I guess he just wanted to make sure there would be no confusion for the next time I came in. But don't worry, stocky Blockbuster boy, there won't be a next time, so we're all set.

Normally, I would find it slightly disturbing to fall asleep with my head in the hands of a strange lady while she rubs aromatic ointment all over my face, but good old Gloria was a pro. Gloria was the aesthetician who gave me a facial today at Dolce in Scottsdale. She was pleasant and professional, and who wouldn't like someone who immediately follows her introduction with a "you're so pretty"?!  I have to be honest, I was a bit apprehensive about pulling up to one of the area's  most hoity-toity day spas in my dinged up Honda Civic, only to pay for the majority of the service with a Groupon. I had braced myself for the judgmental looks of disapproval from the staff. But I'm pleased to report that the looks never came. At least not from the staff.   I was scheduled for a one-hour facial, and I made sure to get there early because I wanted to squeeze every last minute out of that puppy. Gloria started right on time, and she asked me what I wanted to get out of my service, so I told her that I wanted porcelain skin that never aged. Okay, I really told her about my problem areas like that one annoying wrinkle in my forehead and my nickel-sized pores. She explained what she was going to do to my skin, and how I could target those nuisances on my own at home. Then she proceeded to work her magic and lull me off into dreamland.   The facial also included either a hand and arm massage or a foot and leg massage. Because I liked Gloria, I chose the former. Overall, the experience was awesome. My only qualm about it was that I did feel like she was required to push some products on me. For example, a lip treatment that plumps your kisser. Really, Gloria, have you seen my lips? I look like I have a Mrs. Potato Head pout. But I do understand that this is probably required by Dolce itself, so I'm not holding it against Gloria.   Other than that, I was a little embarrassed to carry out the rest of the day's errands with the severe case of shiny-face that I left with, but hey, that's a sign of a successful facial.   Good work, Gloria. If I ever get a real job, I'll be coming to see you on the regular!

You know how when you're in high school, you and your girlfriends raid each other's closets, and it felt like you really had several closets instead of just the one with your same old boring clothes? Well, that's what this was like... but you do have to pay just a little bit to wear their clothes. The good news, though, is that you get to keep them. Or at least you don't have to keep pretending to "forget" to bring them back to her house, like some people we know.   I first noticed this hidden treasure when I was just driving through the neighborhood, but hadn't gotten around to stopping in until today. I was a little turned off at first by the selection of clothes on the half priced rack outside on the sidewalk. Some of the items were great, but some left me wondering if my great aunt Helen had recently cleaned out her closet.   I was quickly reassured by the $28 Cole Haan sandals, $18 Marciano top, $20 BCBG dress, and other miscellaneous merchandise made by fancy designers, some of whom sounded familiar from watching too much "E!" and "What Not To Wear" (not, unfortunately, from having my own closet full of them).  The store was small, but clean and put together really well. Everything was separated by size and style: pants, skirts, dresses, formal dresses. There was an entire wall of tops, (and the OCD part of you will love this), all of which were color-coordinated. Shoes were placed in random spots throughout the store, but easy to find, and the knick-knacky things (jewelry, belts, etc.) were scattered around as well, but still not at all hidden, cluttered or out of order, like some consignment shops I have been in.   Besides the simple and easy layout, I just liked the atmosphere: funky music, fresh air, brightly decorated. Also, the girl behind the counter was awesome. She was there to help if I needed it, but didn't even come close to breathing down my neck. When I asked if she knew of a home décor consignment shop, she referred me to another store in the area, even going so far as to google the exact address for me.   This is the kind of consignment store that makes me wonder why I ever buy retail. I will definitely be going back for that adorable short sleeved Express jacket...unless someone gets to it before me.

Ever the bargain hunter, this is one of those places I love to visit whenever the mood strikes me.  I love that they have everything from picture frames to comforter sets to toilet paper holders. One thing I noticed that they don't have, though are curtain rods. Other than that, if you have a couple hours for some browsing, I would definitely recommend heading over (although not on a Saturday morning or afternoon, for sanity's sake... unless you're the kind of person who gets off on the crowded shopping malls around the holidays. Then by all means...).  However, this is usually not the place to head to if you are looking for something very specific. Typically, this is a little treasure trove of hits and misses, with far more hits than misses. And while you can score some great bargains, there are some higher ticket items that are technically marked down from retail price, that are still a little too steep for me.  In general, though, I'm usually like a kid in a candy store, and I end up leaving wanting to show off all my new treasures and brag about how little I spent on them.

TCBY who??? I stumbled upon Yogurtology on my way to Trader Joe's just after they opened. I love everything from the atmosphere to the crazy variety of 8 (I think) flavors, which are changed out just about every day.  For their grand opening, they had a live band and gave away free fro-yo for a couple hours on a Friday evening, which I though was pretty smart from a marketing P.O.V. The first time I went, I tried mint and a little bit of oreo cookie. Deee-lish! Tonight, I tried the red velvet cake, and the boyfriend (who planned on just coming along for the ride) had peanut butter chocolate.  The toppings are out of control. Everything from fresh fruit and nuts to ginormous marshmallows and gumballs.  And the staff is super friendly and helpful. Want a sample of everything? Okay, no problem!  I would definitely recommend this place. In fact, I'll probably see you there.
