I was traveling from Phoenix to Tucson without a car. My options were paying $200 to be at the airport 1.5 hours early and only to be on the plane for not even an hour and then still have to figure out how to get to my hotel, or take the Arizona Shuttle, which gets me to Tucson in under 2 hours including wait time and home drop-off for $65.  Check-in was a breeze and we left for Tucson about 10 minutes behind schedule. Not bad at all. I think there's a maximum of 10 passengers per van, but there were only 7 on my trip, so the van didn't feel crowded at all. It as in the middle of the afternoon, so there was no traffic and we arrived in Tucson quickly and safely. I got off at one of the shuttle drop-off locations and within minutes a separate van came to take me to my hotel as had previously arranged.   Everything was smooth from my booking to arrival at my final destination. It was a lifesaver for someone without a car.

Quick, no frill restaurant situated in a Mediterranean/Arabic grocery store. Had lunch here my first day in Tempe and the food kept me fueled for the rest of the day. Ordered the beef shawarma and it was quite good. I think the chicken might've been better as some pieces of the beef had been cooked too long and had that mealy texture. The dish usually came with salad, rice, and Arabic bread, but I don't eat grains so just asked for more salad. It was a big dish. The dressing on the salad was tasty, and even though it was mostly iceberg lettuce, I was fine with it this time. The beef came topped with ample tahini sauce. I ate about 3/4 of it and took the rest with me. Dinner for the night taken care of!  My total came out to $8 something including tax. Pretty good for a quick, tasty yet filling lunch.   When I was leaving saw that they have lamb tongue as a sandwich. I wonder if they would make that into a plate dish instead of a sandwich...I bet that's delicious!

Coming from a CrossFit box that was one of the first 50 in the country, I was excited to try another one on my work trip that started back when nobody knew what CrossFit was - CrossFit Southwest. Sadly, of all the CrossFit boxes I've dropped in to, CrossFit Southwest offered the biggest disappointment.  Things started off well. I emailed to ask about dropping in and Ken responded quickly welcoming me to come in without a drop-in fee.   The gym is located in a strip mall. Compared to other CrossFit boxes I've been to, CFSW's set up seemed pretty "old school", or "dated" might be a better term. It's an open space with uneven pieces of matting laid only in the center of the room. The pull-up cage in the center of the room is also quite old and uncoated, so it got slippery quickly. There were no squat racks bolted to the ground, there were maybe 4-5 old mobile racks.  Enough about the equipment because the equipment does not make a gym, and let's face it, you can do a lot of CrossFit without any equipment. I went to the 4pm class and there were about 7 other people there. The workout was ring work as skill and then a metcon of running and pull-ups. Ken lead a semi-warm-up, which sadly for all the ring work involved later had very little shoulder warm-up. There was no progression on the skin-the-cat for those members who couldn't do them or even get upside down on the rings. Coaching for the remainder of class also felt lackluster. Two of the people in class were pretty friendly, but the girl I ended up working with was really unfriendly and didn't even acknowledge me when we were introduced. I'm not saying everyone has to be best friends, but come on, at least show an out-of-towner some hospitality!   I was in Tempe for 3 days and after my first drop-in at CFSW, I was really bummed that I had two more days there to get my CrossFit in. Fortunately after some research that night, I found another box that's about the same distance and ended up going there for my next two workouts in Tempe. Needless to say, I don't think I would recommend CFSW to any of my friends.

Hmm...was this a Hawaiian restaurant? I'm not sure...I don't recall seeing spam on the menu. Or was it because I never got past the Korean dishes that were listed first? Oh wait, wait, I seem to remember seeing something about Kalua pork on Wednesdays.  Usually I would feel bad about going to a regional restaurant and ordering something that's not part of that region, but I was hankering for some Korean food and the people operating this restaurant were clearly Korean, so I figured I couldn't go wrong there.   This turned out to be one of the most flavorful and varied meals I had on this trip! I ordered the spicy pork and galbi plate, which came with 4 sides, and since I didn't want rice, the lady offered to give me an additional side. The sides I picked were kimchi, cabbage salad, spicy cucumber, zucchini salad, and bean sprouts. I read the macaroni salad is delicious, but it's not always easy to get enough veggies on the road, so I thought I'd jump at this opportunity. Both the spicy pork and galbi were tender and tasty. The pork wasn't very spicy, but I'm sure you could ask for more hot sauce. I was too lazy. For $10 plus change, this was a fantastic find.   Next time I'll try the Kalua pork, or something else that's more Hawaiian, if I can get past my Korean food craving.

I was in Tempe for work and after a disappointing experience at CrossFit Southwest, I decided to give CrossFit Haboob a try. They post their daily workout on the website and I was very excited to see a tough heavy barbell metcon on tap. I emailed them the night before and dropped in to the 6am class the next morning.  Haboob isn't a huge space. In fact, the workout space is relatively small and some people that day had to work out outside because it otherwise would've been pretty crowded. BUT, everything else at Haboob was so superb that the small space didn't matter at all! I have to say it was by far the best box I've visited.  Sean was the coach that morning, and he and all the 6amers were really friendly and made me feel at home. The workout was heavy cleans and Sean had good coaching cues. I come from a box that puts a lot of emphasis on form, so it was good to see another coach embracing that and actually taking the time to walk around and correct form. The members at the box cheered each other as well as me on without being in your face, which was really appreciated.   Another thing that I liked about CrossFit Haboob was that their warm-up made sense. Some of the boxes I've been to make the warm-up a low priority and often times the warm-up isn't helpful for what's to come in the workout.   I went back the next day for another workout before I left to travel to another city. Ben was the coach that morning and was as great as Sean. I wish I could've taken CrossFit Haboob with me onto my next destination. And now I know which box I'll be returning to if I'm ever in Tempe and which box to recommend.
