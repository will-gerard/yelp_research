This is an amazing breakfast spot. It's constantly packed and for good reason. Come here as soon as you can. I would even call and make a reservation just incase.

This place is something else. The whole ambiance of this place is nice. It's clean and up to date. But on the other end I purchased their salad which was good but the portion size was ridiculously small. I think I ate it all in 5 bites? My water glass had visible lip marks. Do they not clean their dishes? I mentioned and showed the server and just kinda shrugs and says I'll take it back to get washed. No sort of apology what so ever.

I like this place a lot. Good food and good prices. Richard is a cool guy. This isn't the type of place where they sell cheap sushi. Sushi is simple you get what you pay for. Richards prices in my opinion are fair especially for now delicious it is.

I worked at Cafe Rumba back in Mesa and I must say it was awesome. The owners are wonderful and the food is great. I would recommend everything but my absolute favorite thing is their salads. Place is clean and has a nice laid back feeling. Love this place and I'm glad they kept this going.

I ate her a few weeks back and I must say it wasn't the best. Our server was great, and I understand places can get busy but what I don't understand is how they feel the need to blast the A/C and keep the fans on high. We had to ask our server twice to turn our fan above us off and she replied both times saying she agrees it was cold and she will ask the manager to turn it down. The people around us started complaining about it being cold as well and then I overheard another server tell the other server "the manager thinks it's too hot in here so he doesn't want to turn it off". That said enough about the place for me. Good and decent food and like I said I understand it gets busy that stuff is out of their servers control but management needs a tune up.

I honestly can't say enough about this place, this is amazing food and the staff is great. As a fellow person from the east coast I love the little taste of home I can get over here. Fair prices and good quality food. The burgers and sandwiches are delicious and I'm also a big fan of the breakfast here as well.

I love this place it so simple and straight forward. The staff is so friendly and loving. And they have lots and lots of patience. I know my dog can be a pain. Just so loving and really just a big ball of energy. I'm so excited to come back in a couple weeks.
