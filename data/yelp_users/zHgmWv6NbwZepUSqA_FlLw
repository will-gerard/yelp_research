one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food.

nothing to rave about this place. service was poor and the food was bad. I know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure.

first to start, I would like to say, WOW to kevin. he is one of our head service person and his service is off the chart. here what we order Cherry Sweet Grass Smoked Quail Breast w/ Slow Braised Mole Adobo Rabbit Escargot, Wild Mushrooms & Caramel Goat Cheese Bellota Iberico Llomo Wrapped High Country Elk Loin Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo Mexican Chocolate Souffl√© the food was top chart. fresh, presentation was excellent. definitely a place to come back and try different items. the service it self worth for you to come back. Kevin, I'm calling before coming. to make sure you are around.

its hard to find a good sushi place in phoenix. so this place is not an exception. they do have tons of rolls menu, but not very creative. majority of the rolls are made almost identical to the rest of the rolls. - cream cheese, tempura. what's up with that. the rice. this place also did not get the rice right. over kill with the rice vinegar + sugar. yea. sugar. I can still taste it. terrible when you eat the rice with over power taste of vinegar and sugar. and then, they use a lot of sweet sauce (unagi sauce) to make the food taste like chocolate cake (very sweet in a way) and one of the item they use tons of mayo.

This place is not your typical sushi place. its more like a sports bar. Great for first timer. Large portions and the price is very reasonable. this place is like american sushi bar. its a fun place to go with friends or family. but if you are looking for a good sushi/food. this ain't it. Taste, is nothing to rave about and you get what you paid for.  this is more like the americanize version of sushi.

one of the best hyatt in phoenix. the nice thing about this place is that the pool is all in one area, so you don't have to run around to look for someone. yea, its not as great as other resort (hilton has a nicer pool area) but if you can get a suite, its not a bad spot for a weekend vacation. the regency club is nice. have a great selection of snack (breakfast, and deserts)

I was expecting an authentic indonesian restaurant in madison. reason is that there are many indonesian student in Madison. but apparently, not. don't get me wrong, it is not bad, because the food is now tailored to american taste. I'm kinda surprise to see soo many people in the restaurant, and I'm the only non white. I ordered empek2, sayur lodeh, tahu and some other items. the food don't even look right (close), but it don't taste even close to what it supposed to be. if you think you've taste indonesian food and you think that place taste good. wait till you taste the real good one. it will blow your sock off.  good place to get to know indonesian food. but for people who are looking for good indonesian food, not here.

at first I was skeptical about the place. but will give it a try anyway. it took forever for our food to come in, because we didn't order the lunch special but order a tons of authentic food. 2 appetizer and 2 main dishes. unfortunately I can't pronounce or remember the name of the items we ordered. but the food was amazing. you have to ask for their special salsa. awesome. I asked for 2nd, and they say. well. we sell these and don't give out to customer. lol. anyway, the sour fish was ok. but the tamales is not your average mexican tamales. and don't call their food mexican food. because they are not. what we ordered was colombian food and they were goood. and the purple drink was good as well.

great pizza. I'm not a pizza fan, but since this place is one of the list I have to try, so I have to give it a try. the best time to get here is. Lunch before 11:15. otherwise, expect 20 - 40 min wait time. I wouldn't go as the best pizza in the US. but it is one of the best pizza in Phoenix. been here a couple of times and tried a couple of their items on the menu. the best thing about their pizza is the sauce. where most places the sauce is sour and too bland (like regular tomato paste).

another gem in the rough, I would say. this place is excellent.  Master Yasu is great and friendly. he will cater the food based on what you like/don't like and be prepare to be blown away. the fish are fresh, the sushi rice got the right mix of the spices and the kitchen also have some great food. this is how sushi are supposed to taste like. ask the cheff for Omakase and say, feed me please.

Service: standard japanese place. Portion: small Quality: cheap fish Taste: too fishy  I'm surprise that many sushi restaurants are trying to make profit by cutting corner. Making a good sushi is not all that too difficult. every sushi restaurant are using the same ingridients. Rice, fish and condiments. (Including the rice vinegar, soy sauce, mayo, etc) bottom line is, that there is no secret on making good sushi. its not like trying to cooking french food or some bbq with secret recipes. the bad about this place. The Rice is not properly marinated, The seaweed was very chewy and they are not using fresh fish - or at least, get a good ones. I know its the desert but you can still get a good fish. the food from kitchen is actually not bad (tempura, tonkatsu, udon) overall, if you are looking for good sushi, this isn't the place.

awesome food. one of a good dining experience with excellent service. the food is a tad salty for my taste, I wish they use more natural ingredient other than Salt. presentation was great and cooked my filet to perfection. the meat on the other hand, had a few gristle. :( that seems awful.. I would try a different meat dishes, but they should monitor their steak quality..

great vietnamese noodle here in scottsdale. if you don't want to drive to camelback (other pho place). this place will satisfy your craving for pho. they don't have much of other vietnamese food, I think because in this area they don't have much of vietnamese. so if you just want pho, this place will do. if you want other vietnamese food. you have to go to other vietnamese restaurant.

How should I say this. I guess this one would be an exception. This time I'm not writing this place for review, but rather as a warning. Please stay away from this buffet place. The food quality and the taste was, hm.. Let see, I thought there wouldn't be any buffet that could be worst than chinese buffet or, Circus circus buffet. Apparently this one is. So, if you are planning to have a meal here, avoided it at all cost.

let see.  this place was high on my list on place to eat. but to my surprise, the food was really .. mediocre at best. so here 3 of us went there for a great meal.  the service was great. the place was stunning. and the waitresses really know the menu inside out. he started to explain the menu items from left side of the book to the right side of the book. amazing. so I started with Ebi, maguro, and scallop (standard nigiri 2 piece each) then 1 cook scallop (supposed to be cook with asparagus sauce) the sushi was ok, but the rice was dry. it fell apart when you pickup the sushi ok, maybe their sushi is not that great. so we try the kitchen food (cooked food) we had the beef fillet, rock cod , tiger prawn. and 2 order of mushroom (3 piece in a skewer)/ the tiger prawn only 1 piece (grill to perfection) but lack of taste. granted the food were in a nice presentation. the beef was too dry and the ginger flavoring .. hm.. not to my liking. the cod was ok. size of 1/2  of an apple.  then here come the bill. to my surprise. it was a little over 300. I was like hm. we didn't eat that much, and the food wasn't all that great. but bill is a bill. so net.. net is: if you are looking to have a great sushi. this place ain't it. if you are looking for a great steak, this place also ain't it. but if you are planning to show how much you can spend, this place is a great place to do it. so after all the meals, we have to go else where for another meal.

great food all around. presentation of the sushi also great. the fish is always fresh. been back to this place many time. and so far, this is one of the best sushi in town. the only catch is, this place is not cheap.  you can spend $50 easy for lunch on a couple of nigiri. one thing though, skip the udon.

this is one of the old building. the carpet is sticky and the room is smelly. if you are looking for a decent place to hit, this ain't it. they need to fix the interior and rip all of the carpet. making it a bad name for hilton. other than the room, all standard hotel service. but again, the carpet and the room is bad.

well, I guess I wouldn't call this place a SUSHI place. fusion would be more accurate. its a mixture of Chinese and Thai food. the sushi is more like a gimmick.  if you are looking for good food, then this place would spoil you. decor and service, yes, awesome. but you go to restaurant to eat not to be service. (well sorta, but that's not the whole point). anyway, if you are looking for sushi, skip. if you are willing to try a mix of chinese and thai, this place would do the trick.

I love this place. every time I come in, this place always crawling with people wanting to try for the first time. so its fun to watch while you eat your yogurt. I love the pistachio mixed with coconut. but since I went here often, I have tried all of their flavor.  I don't like their chocolate flavor. the taste kinda weird for me.

when I was in San Jose, I always know where to go for a great Vietnamese food. finally I found another place here when I'm travelling in Phoenix. this place is a local for people looking for a great vietnamese food. can't go wrong if you want an authentic vietnamese food.

the bad part on travelling is: have to keep on looking for a great food. this place isn't authentic enough to be called thai food.

love this place. don't expect great service, since they only have 1 person doing most of the things. taking order, clean the table, bring food to the table, fill the water and casher. but so far, their food has been consistently good. I have tried a bunch of their dishes, so far. quite satisfying (for phoenix area). still can't compare to what I had in the bay area. (snob...) but it is useful as a guidance standard. come here and can't go wrong with the korean food.

Excellent baby back ribs. the meat is tender and the seasoning is right on. this one is not the dry rub version. but slow cook with sauce that caramelize all over the ribs.  don't use the sauce, because it can ruin the rib taste. just savor the meat. this place is a keeper in phoenix.

great place, very clean and service was great. the food, a ok. devil's egg. you can actually skip that, no flavor. the short ribs was way too much salt for my taste, I wish they ease up a bit, because you can always add if you want it saltier. Andouille sausage, shrimp, and grits. you have to ask them extra spicy, otherwise it would be too bland. we asked for extra spicy, now it taste just right. bold. the grits, hm. I don't think it goes well with the dish. anyway, then we order the donut as our appetizer. that was nice too. great place for dinner.

they have one of the spicies sushi roll. they have the spicy sushi challange posted on the wall. definately can make your mouth scream for water. but unfortunately, because of the spicy tuna, they forgot the basic of sushi. quality and taste.  yes with the spicy tuna, it will kill your taste bud. but I still do want to taste other than hot sauce. the korean food there is better than the sushi.

this is a typical americanize version of jack of all trades. hawaiian, chinese and japanese food all in one place. went here for local yelp get together. wife had a chinese food and I tried the japanese food (sushi).  if you come here for the sushi. skip if you come here for a quick chinese food, this one will be fine. I wouldn't call it authentic chinese food though. its more like your typical chinese fast food @your local mall.

I have to say, this one is not a good sushi at all. this one is one of the worst sushi ever. Costco sushi even taste better than this.  I'm sorry, I know that this place just open a week ago, but.. I can't say anything positive about the food. The place used to be a fastfood restaurant (hawaian bbq) that is being converted into sushi join. but with No sushi bar (surprise). yes the place have a great service, friendly and bright. but I'm only rate based on quality of the food. yes I'm in phoenix, but still, there are some other decent place to eat. unless they fix on how they prepare the sushi. they'll not get any repeat customer. yes they gave me free ice-cream and other sashimi.
