Just meh. I went for a diablito because I didnt want to drive to 59th ave  & McDowell. What I got cannot even compare to what I usually get at other places. The ice was like chips and there wasn't cacahuates or all the other mexican candies. I can't speak on any other menu items, but I probably wouldn't return considering there are water and ice and raspado places all over the city.

Great experience all around. I really appreciate that I wasn't bombarded by sales people as soon as I walked in the place, which seems to be a trend at most stores I went to. I was able to look around without an annoying salesman following me or trying to sell me on things. I found the set I wanted, a nice lady asked if I needed help and I was out the door soon after. Delivery was $65 and I went on a Thursday and my set was just delivered this morning (Monday).For an additional $10 I could've had the set delivered same day, but I wasn't ready so I decided to wait. I received a call on Sunday confirming a Monday deliver and also a call on Monday morning when the truck was about 15 minutes away. I really couldn't ask for much more In a furniture buying experience. Next time I need to purchase furniture, I will definitely check out Pruitt's first.

As a first time puppy owner, I became worried when my 8wk old puppy started vomitting. I had started the process of switching his food the day before and thought that may have been the reason but I didn't want to take any chances so after checking out Southside Animal Hospital on Yelp, I decided to have him checked out here. We were seen by Dr Evans and after discussing my puppies symptoms he agreed it could possibly be the food change but also brought up having a parvo test done. He was not pushy at all about it and I actually wanted to have it done to rule it out. He informed me of the cost upfront and proceeded with the test which came back positive. He discussed treatment options/approx prices and gave me statistic info and personal experiences with the virus and course of treatments. I decided on the appropriate treatment for my budget and severity of my puppies symptoms and they began right away with antibiotic &  anti-nausea injections as well as injecting fluids into my puppies skin. The tech was very thorough and explained what he was doing and taught me so I could administer the fluids at home.   Overall I feel like this office knows they will gain/keep patients by offering necessary affordable pet care and not taking advantage of people. Not once was I pressured into services or treatments, instead the vet gave me options and advice. I will definitely return.

I have no problems with the staff here. My problem is with items I need never being in stock. So annoying and such a waste of my time. Not sure if it's issue with suppliers or staff not knowing how to order?

My friend just kind of threw sammys out as an option for lunch without any planning or thought. This place looks like a good spot for lunch with a few coworkers but not exactly the best spot for families with children. We stood awkwardly at the front waiting For a table for for 8. Didn't seem like that much to ask for but we waited at least 10 minutes just to be crammed in with a bunch of other tables. I ordered the mahi fish tacos for $13 and wondered why we didn't just go to red lobster, I had no idea this place was so expensive. My friend got an artichoke pizza and said it was great. My fish tacos were pretty good as well. The other guests got burgers with no complaints either. I only gave 2 stars because the staff was artificially friendly. I didn't get sincere customer service that I always expect anywhere I go, not to mention at a pricey joint. The waiter was quick to try to get you another beer, but non existent when you needed a water or soda refil. If I were going to lunch with my boss and he were paying, I'd come again.

Ga-ross!! I can't believe I just spent $30 here! Undercooked egg rolls, pathetic chicken lo mein and just shitty tasting food all around. I don't live anywhere near this place and I will never return.

Don't waste your time. The Chow mien noodles were stuck together, the chips they give you with your soup tasted like straight oil, the won ton had no flavor, the broth is like water. I went once and will not return. Go to Li's bowl on 35th ave instead.

I try to avoid this location at all costs. It seems like there is always a crazy line, no matter what time it is. They NEVER have ice cream or apple pies. They will mess your order up, it's almost a guarantee. Like someone else said, you might even have someone asking you for change while you're waiting to get to the payment window.

I only gave 2 stars because I've had breakfast or brunch here before and it wasn't too bad. Dinner on the other hand, yuck! Do not pay full price for this dinner buffet! Ever. The food was mediocre at best. The mexican & Asian selections were pathetic. I guess if you like fatty, rare cooked pieces of beef, this might be the buffet for you. I'm a fatty and can usually get in a few good trips at a buffet, I was almost ashamed of myself for not even finishing 2 plates.

i like shopping at this little market. I think ownership has changed recently and the girl who helped me was extremely friendly and helpful. Years ago they used to have a cool bee colony in the wall and you could watch the bees in action but it's gone now :(   I find the prices here more reasonable than the market on baseline & 32nd st with much more friendly service so I dont

DONT DO IT!!!  This place is sick. Off the top, who's idea was it to offer a chocolate fountain? It was like the babysitter to all the unattended children. All that recirculating dirty chocolate **quivers**  From the time we walked in and smelled nothing but dirty pits in the 25min line, we should've known to just leave. The food was, well, Golden Corral food. If you've been once in your life, you've probably already had everything they have to offer. Maybe eating at Vegas buffets has set the bar high for me, or maybe the food here is just that nasty. Like others have mentioned, there really is only a handful of items worth eating. Did I mention the sticky floors and masses of unattended children? I can't act like I don't like the banana pudding, so there goes that one star. Oh and the cotton candy was fun. Service sucked, environment sucked, and food sucked even more.

I really like al pastor and after I saw the pics here for this place I knew I needed to give them a try. I've never been here so it was a little confusing walking in I didn't know how/where to order, so we just down and after a few minutes a lady came and asked us to move to another table saying that one was wobbly. Kind of annoying because I liked where we were but I think I was just hungry and being a bitch. Chips & salsa were given and we had our food within a few minutes. I ordered 2 tacos al pastor & hubby 1  lengua taco. They serve the tacos with a red sauce and I also requested a green. My pastor tacos were really good! The green sauce was spicy & delicious and complimented the taco so well. After tasting my food, I felt like I had just ate a snickers and turned back into the happy go lucky person I usually am! My hubby just kept mumbling "it's good" in regards to his taco & the salsas, I don't eat tongue so I can't speak on his food but he seemed to really enjoy. I Only gave 4 stars for 3 reasons:   1) confusing sitting/ordering process&being asked to move from my table 2) flys, it's annoying and gross 3) the carrots, radish seemed dried/old  Bottom Line: I'll be coming back..  soon! 3 delicious tacos with chips and salsa for just under $5!! One of the best taco shops I've found in Phoenix.

University animal hospital came recommended by my vet (southside animal hospital) & also by the people I purchased my Doberman from when I asked for an ear crop referral. I researched vets across the valley and I'm glad I decided on having my dobermans ears cropped at University. Aside from the recommendations, there were a couple things that ultimately made me choose University. 1) they use a laser to perform the crop 2) the procedure is all inclusive  3) they offer a new client discount online    When I called around getting quotes for ear crops, I remember taking note that some places would charge an additional fee for after visits and tapings (average $20 a visit). The awesome thing about University is their ear crop service is a package deal. You pay one price and it includes pre surgery exam, blood work, the laser surgery, take home meds and all visits necessary after surgery to ensure your dogs ears heal properly and stand accordingly.    The facility is modern, always clean & smells great because they have some special odor eliminating candles they use/sell. Staff has been super friendly & always accommodating, they all love animals and make sure you and your pet feel welcome. If you love keurig coffee, you're in luck! They always have a nice selection of coffee to enjoy while you wait.  The day of surgery, I met with Dr Gus & Dr Steinburg. They did a brief history and discussed the procedure and an individualized plan for my puppy's crop. From what I understand, Dr Gus has been performing ear crops for many years and Dr Steinburg is learning under him to become one of the limited Vets who will continue to perform this procedure. I felt very confident in them and allowed their knowledge to choose the best crop for my puppy based on his age/ear shape/cartilage formation. I got a call a few hours later letting me know my puppy did great and was in recovery. They gave me a time frame to come and pick him up later on that afternoon. When I picked up my puppy I met with a tech and was educated on after care and was even given a special printout of my puppy with his Dr prior to his surgery as a special keepsake. Overall, I have nothing but positive things to say about University Animal Hospital.

Consider yourself warned. There is NOTHING, seriously NOTHING you need that is gonna be worth the time your gonna spend in line at this walmart. As a few other reviews mentioned, if you went to get a particular item i.e.-Deodorant,toothpaste 9 times out of 10 that item you NEED won't be in stock. This Walmart is NOTORIOUS for that, really. I've never had bad experiences with employees however. It just sucks that life could be so much easier if you could get in and out and get what your family needs but that doesn't typically happen at this location :(

My favorite buffet in Vegas! All you can drink mimosas and hard cider! YES!!!!  I dream about this place and swear ill visit every trip to Vegas, I usually don't, but it's a great buffet. I have to agree with others regarding freshness and why there is so many open tables when there is a big line. I've gone twice and by the grace of God have been able to get right in on a weekend both times. Ill return to this buffet every chance i get!

This is a fun little feed store. Pratts usually caries a decent selection of reptiles and small animals. Almost every time I've been, there is a nice older lady who is interacting with the animals and petting them showing them all love. The staff is always helpful & knowledgeable. I bought two chickens and the staff took plenty of time giving me info about raising chickens. I bought my chickens 2.5 mo ago and they are healthy and thriving. Only 4 stars because prices are a little steep.

Typical urgent care. The lobby and rooms were exceptionally clean. The wait, however, was rediculous both times I went. They just leave you sitting in a room so long you're *this close* to just leaving. I won't return.

Had a great time here!! Tracy is a white guy that can make a MEAN michelada! I wish I would've watched him make it, it was so good. Like, better than my Mexican husbands good.. But I'll never admit that to him. The atmosphere was like something I've never seen in a pub/bar. There was a little sitting area almost looked like something from a Starbucks or cafe. I love candles and I noticed several candle warmers for a little ambiance. It was still darkly lit and some fun characters in & out. Did I mention Tracy is the shit? He let us choose some music, made great drinks & really excelled in customer service & hospitality.

Seeing all these amazing reviews has me really second guessing why I turn to yelp. I'm not exactly sure if this is constant issue, but there were flys ALL OVER just landing on & around you & your food which from the beginning made me question what I was doing there. This taco cart really is not that great! I ordered a carne Asada & al pastor taco. The  flour tortillas were obviously freshly made, but lacking that special something of a homemade tortilla. I've gotten better tasting carne Asada at filibertos so I'm so confused why everyone is praising it. My al pastor was better than my carne Asada but weirdly chorizo-y tasting and crispy. The prices were decent & the size of the tacos were also decent so better than a one star rating for me.

As good as it gets in AZ. This is probably your best bet for a Vegas style buffet 300 miles away from Vegas. The line can be horrendous, especially on holidays and weekends. Wandering Horse is by far nothing like home town buffet or Golden Corral.  On seafood nights it's like they need line security for the crab & lobster claw section because people start getting ignorant and act like they don't know how a line works but other than that, it's a very enjoyable buffet. High quality for the most part and very clean.

I've been wanting to go back ever since I left this place. Waking up thinking about sushi, making lunch thinking about sushi, contemplating more sushi for dinner. Mexican sushi is life. My husband and I went on a Saturday night and when we arrived the place was pretty full but we were seated immediately. I don't really like the table setup, they aren't that comfy & I felt like a sardine almost all crammed in there. I'm really confused as to why people are complaining about the prices, we've payed similar prices pretty much every place we've ever ordered sushi, traditional or not. Our bill was around $50 for 2 rolls & 3 drinks. Yes a little steep but well worth it in my opinion, and I'm almost sure this will be our new anniversary/special occasion go to (good bye red lobster) Some better drink specials on weekends would be nice. The food was excellent, seriously, like I want to go back right now. We got the culichi(sp?) & tres quesos. They have a live DJ And he played all Latin music. It was really loud and almost like a club but I enjoyed it and had no problem conversing with my husband. Our server wasn't like  THEE best, but he wasn't bad either so I can't complain about customer service. The hostess,who actual reseated us into a "intimate" booth did so very willingly after we placed our order and I felt 1,000 times better and probably enjoyed myself way more once we sat in that booth with some funky lighting fixture that cast a great orange glow.   **Bottom line.. Cheaper drinks on weekends and this place will get 5 stars from me. I definitely recommend and will definitely be returning.

How is this place not on every street corner? For $2/$3 you can get one of the best snow cones you've ever had! I LOVE how it's a true snow texture and not "shaved" ice. The ladies at the window were beyond helpful and patiently waiting while I made my difficult decision offering suggestions and recommendations. The customer service, reasonable prices & amazing product has earned this little spot 5 stars from me. If there was a Phoenix location, I'd be a regular.

My favorite Mexican sushi spot (mocorito) was closed so I figured this would be just as good. All Mexican sushi is the same right? Wrong. Although this sushi appeared identical to my favorite spot, it was completely lacking flavor. For that reason alone, I don't think I will return. It was really that flavorless and a waste of $30. No issues with customer service the food just sucked.

I tried this restaurant for the first time last week. Will definitely return. I ordered the house chow mien lunch special. My total was $7 and some change and my plate included a cup of soup, an eggroll and a crab Rangoon. I was pleased when I counted 4 shrimp within my noodles, that's usually around the amount I get when I order a large chow mien. The chow mien was was excellent. The fried items were ok, not bad and not best I've ever had. Sadly I was not impressed with my hot&sour soup, it could've used more flavor for sure. The fried rice on the side was very basic brownish looking without any veggies. I took my food home but the inside of the restaurant was very clean with awesome South Mountain views.

Mary was awesome. She treated me like I was a family friend. I didn't feel pressured or like I was being taken advantage of. I would recommend calling Mary at valley goldmine if you are wanting to sell some jewelry, she will take care of you.

Drove past earlier in the day laughing & joking about the taco truck in the brake shop parking lot. After a few hours and several drinks later, I found myself ordering tacos here. Sooo glad I let those drinks decide that we needed tacos from this sketchy looking spot. All I really know is that the pastor & asada tacos were pretty amazing. They had this pineapple salsa or pineapple pieces for the tacos in a self serve salsa bar, why does every taco shop that sells al pastor not have that readily available!? Where has that pineapple salsa been all my life? Good tacos  will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.  **only 4 stars because I've had better tortillas and $2 a taco is kinda up there, won't stop me from coming back though..

Very clean and professional shop. I had work done by Zander & I was thoroughly impressed by his attention to detail and professionalism. All of the artists at Knucklehead support each other and it was nothing but good vibes here. I saw some amazing art done by truly talented artists while I was getting my tattoo done. I went on a Wednesday nite and every artist there (5/6?) were booked and doing pieces, nobody was sitting around waiting for work. I like Zander's work & recommend you Check out knuckleheads Facebook page/website/IG for artist work that suits your personal style preference.

I won a gift card and that's pretty much the only reason I went to check this place out. I don't live anywhere near this location and honestly don't see myself returning. I kid you not, reading the other yelp reviews prepared me to encounter some sort of issue while presenting my gift card. I gave 2 stars because I went around 12pm and I can't really base my reviews off crowd (90% seniors) or environment. The hostess was very nice and friendly, the restaraunt itself was clean and the patio looked really inviting. Now back to my 2 stars. First the waitress was trying to tell me I had to special reserve and some other BS. This paper gift card listed no exclusions what so ever. It did say "available for parties of any size" or something like that, and that's where she tried to say I needed to contact Tammy and set up a private party. Ha, I didn't drive from the south side (to a sports bar)to be turned away on some made up exclusion. So of course she had to go check with management ( which I expected) but that should've been done before staff makes up their own exclusions/fine print and tells patrons no.To my suprise (sarcasm) they did accept the card!! Long story short, we ordered food to go. Chicken& waffles (I should've known smh), adult mac&cheese, buffalo wings & Irish nachos. $40+worth of food & not one napkin, spoon, fork, condiment, nothing. Irish fries, which waitress recommended, was pretty decent. Chicken & frozen waffles with no syrup was deffinately not what I was expecting nor worth $5 let alone $12.The biggest disappointment by far! The buffalo wings had no sauce! I got a box of fatty wings with no flavor, no sauce AND NO FREAKING RANCH. The adult Mac&cheese was pretty good, greasy but good. I gave 2 stars because this place could be a potentially fun dive with the patio. I rarely eat bar food so I'm not sure if all places serve overpriced mediocre food. This place sure does. NEVER order the chicken & waffles if you've ever eaten at Lo Lo's.. Or if you like good waffles. I should have known. I didn't know if would be like that though. I could've waited and "possibly" been able to use the gift card to buy drinks on a weekend, but didn't want to get my hopes up.

Boomer is one of Glendale AZ's finest tattoo artists. Fifth Finger is a clean and modern tattoo studio. Boomer  gives each patron individualized attention and puts his heart and soul in each piece he does. A true artist, pay him a visit, let him know what ideas you have for your next tattoo, you will not be disappointed!

Highly recommend you check their website for available inventory if you're looking to buy a new car. This place sets the standard for how buying a used car should be. I went in looking to check out a Honda Pilot, I wasn't buying quite yet but wanted to get a feel for the vehicle and compare a few. Brad was sooo easy to work with. No hassle, no pressure, no stress what's so ever! He offered to let me take a test drive and had me put my info on an iPad & handed me the keys. I haven't yet purchased a vehicle but for sure I will be checking what Millenium has available when I'm ready to purchase.

Out of all the Chinese take outs in the damn city I picked this one. Location was what made me choose this place,it's right off the freeway as I headed back to Phoenix.What I didn't do was check the rating/reviews. The man who took my order was extremely friendly and the place was pretty clean that's why I gave 2 stars. The food however, was disappointing. Everything was hot and fresh, but flavor was either off or lacking. I ordered the lunch chicken lo mein and my husband got the lunch Mongolian beef. His was ok, just ok nothing more. It seemed like a small portion in my opinion. My lo mein was pretty flavorless almost like spaghetti without sauce. I also ordered a hot and sour soup (they only offer 1 size & it's almost $5) and it was weird. Not really hot or sour but almost tasted like toast. The only good I can say about the soup is at least it had some substance to it and it wasn't all watery and thin. I love a good hot & sour soup and this was far from what I'd call good. Probably for the first time ever, I would have rather had Panda Express. I even passed one in boulder city and wished I would've waited. Bottom line, I wasted 18 bucks.

OMG I love this place! How have I not know about it sooner!? For 18.99 you get 3lbs of cooked carne asada (a styrofoam take out box FULL), rice, beans, salsa and tortillas. No joke, after feeding our entire family, we still have meat for tacos in the morning! It is by far one of my favorite places to feed a big family for under 20 bucks. They also offer chicken and and other meats already cooked. I've only gone for the carne asada so I can't speak for anything else, but they carry everything other carnecerias carry. One day I went there was a lady set up with tables in the front selling jewelry and other random things you'd find at the park&swap. Typically, you'd spend the same amount on 3 or 4 pieces of carne asada that you're gonna have to fire up your grill and cook.

I'm not sure why, but this Sephora doesn't know how to manage inventory. So far on 2 occasions they didn't have what I needed in stock. I give up. The staff, for the most part was friendly and eager to help. I can't comment on their product knowledge, but they were very friendly and I was approached by about 3-4 employees as I looked for foundation they didn't have in stock. I've never had items being in stock as an issue at the Ray Rd location, so I will continue to take my business there.
