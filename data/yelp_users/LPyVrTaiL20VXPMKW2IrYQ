Michelle is absolutely phenomenal. I purchased a groupon for her with the intention of only going to her for those. After my first session with her, she is my massage therapist for life. She is amazing! She knows when to and when not to talk during the massage. She clears the energy out of her cozy space with sage after each customer and makes you feel super comfortable. She is the best and has made me a lifetime customer. I highly recommend her to anyone that even mentions a massage. She is able to find any knot and work on exactly what you need her to. Go to her and you will not be disappointed.

It really is unfortunate that their service is so horrible, because the food is so good. Their salsa and tacos are delicious, but the service is horrible. Everytime I think I will give it another chance cause it tastes great, but the service I have received negates the food at this point. They nickle and dime everything. Chips and salsa cost extra, I asked for a side of guac, it came a couple minutes before my meal, but was the small side and not the app like I ordered, and when I said I didnt want the guac anymore cause my food had arrived and I wanted it with my chips and instead asked for another side of chips, they told me they would have to charge me for it. These are examples of issues I had the last time I went, which will be the last time I go. I went when this place opened up, there was the family running it, so I excused the poor service for the fact that it was new and a local business. Everytime I have gone in there, they are charging for something else, including the various salsas I got for free every other time I went. Its disappointing that the food is so good, but because of the ownership and service, I will never go back.
