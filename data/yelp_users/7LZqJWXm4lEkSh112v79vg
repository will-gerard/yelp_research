This is the best shooting range that I have been to.  Not only were they priced fairly, but the facilities to shoot were incredible!  We had a group of about 6 people and we were able to utilize a special skeet shooting range this past weekend.  The individuals that were conducting this special pre-dove season shooting were uber helpful and were able to provide key advice while shooting.  I wish that I lived closer to Phoenix so we could go more often.  I would recommend this to anyone of any level of expertise.

This was the first time I had been to see a play, "Wicked," which was absolutely fabulous!  I liked the accessibly of the location and also the parking was great.  All the staff was helpful and the concession stands did take credit cards.  I really liked this venue.

I really loved this place!  The staff is friendly and it is absolutely amazing scenery.  I was at the resort for a wedding and it was beautiful!  I really loved all the accommodations.  After the wedding they provided a shuttle into town to a local bar and they were so helpful!  The lobby always smells like Krispy Kreme donuts...I have no idea why, but it was delicious.  I hope to someday go back to this resort and spend a few more days.

I felt like I was back in a small town.  The staff was precious and always accommodating.  I ordered a more healthy option...or so I thought.  It was an egg white omelet with lots of veggies.  I was proud of my decision to keep on track, but it was LOADED with cheese.  However, it was very delicious -- and less unhealthy than most options.  I would go back.  They also have this booth that is made from a car....super cute and an experience!

This is a hidden gem in Mesa.  It was one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eat at in my life.  Not only was the food excellent, but the service was superb.  We were able to get the flat noodles and also a rice dish.  I cannot wait to go back.

This hotel was very nice!  I loved the roomy rooms and the cleanliness of the hotel.  It was a great experience.  The staff was amazing and check in and out was wonderful!  I would recommend this hotel if you have to stay in the Gilbert area to anyone.  They also have a hot breakfast and Starbucks / drinks if you want to purchase that.  Overall, great experience!

Never Never Never travel this airlines.  They boast to be the lowest prices, but the hidden fees are off the wall.  I will never travel them again.    My experience was that I purchased tickets and I had no idea that if I did not make my first leg of the trip I would not be able to use the return.  I understand after that happen and I have acknowledged that it was my fault, but they were not will to help at all.  I ended up purchasing an additional ticket to get on the flight returning to my destination and when I was going to take a carry on (just one) they charge me $40.  What?!?  If I wanted to check it, it would have been $38.  When I finally got on board the flight attendants were not the nicest and beverages were $3.    I guess the old saying was correct that you get what you pay for, but I ended up paying a lot for a crappy experience.  TERRIBLE!  I plan to write a letter to the company listing my grievances of this horrible trip.  NEVER AGAIN!!!

This location is not only clean and convenient, but the food is amazing.  Chick Fil A absolutely knows how to do it right and this location proves that it still continues!

I stopped here on my way out of town.  It has a wonderful location and even an outdoor place to sit.  Not only was the store beautiful with a plethora of cakes and mini-cones in the display, but the staff was great.  I ordered a cappuccino blast which was my favorite and he made it amazing.  I am rather picky so he was able to accommodate what I wanted.  The blast was the perfect consistency and I was glad to have stopped.    Upon checkout he also asked if I had tried the new ice cappuccino blast and I had said no and he told me about the .99 promotion deal which was very impressive to me.  He also gave me a punch card which was great.    This was one of the best Baskin-Robbins experiences I've had in a long time.  I really was glad to see 31 is still doing great things.

I have never had the kind of amazing food like the food I had at the Arrogant Butcher!!!  Not only is it very trendy and fun, but it is also just a great place for hanging out!    I order the pretzel bun sandwhich...have never had anything like that before I tried and it was out of this world.  It was one of the best dining experiences I had in a long time.  Everything was fabulous from the experience to the staff.    They also had wonderful cocktails and the happy hour was decent as well!    Highly recommend this place to everyone!
