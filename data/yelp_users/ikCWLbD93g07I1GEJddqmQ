Wow!!! I was there for about 30 seconds including the time it took for one of their reps to greet me, find what I was looking for and ring me up on his phone. I'm super impressed!!

This is the valleys best kept secret for authentic pho.  The surrounding area is not that great and it's kind of a hole in the wall but the food is excellent and the service is great. My favorite dish there is the chicken fried rice but everything I've had there is delicious as well.

I went there for breakfast at 5 am and there were three other tables with customers that had already been served. I ordered a soda and a quesadilla. The waiter brought out my soda after about 10 minutes and then I waited another 30 before you came out again to apologize for the wait.   I'm not much of a cook but even I can make a quesadilla in my microwave in one minute... At that point I paid for the soda and left. I eat out almost every meal and that was some of the worst service that I have ever seen.

This place is great, they have a wide variety of healthy items on the menu to choose from and they open early. David is always friendly and remembered my name after only meeting me once.  This is where I go for breakfast almost everyday now.

I love this place!! The staff are all very friendly and down to earth. The service is excellent and everything I've ever ordered here is absolutely delicious.  I can't believe they are going to be closing soon. I will definitely be driving to their Tempe location when it opens in January.

This is definitely one of my favorite places to be. Training Kung Fu from Sifu Mark has been extremely positive for me and a skill that will stay with me for the rest of my life. I have taken other martial arts on and off since I was a child but Kung Fu is the only style that I feel comfortable enough with to use to defend myself. I strongly recommend this school for everyone for self defense or conditioning, regardless of any prior experience in martial arts.
