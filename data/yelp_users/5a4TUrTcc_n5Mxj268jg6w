I wasn't sure what to expect when I went here, but I was quite impressed.  I got my hair cut by a wonderful stylist by the name of Ashur. I had gotten my hair cut somewhere else when I came in. I gave quite a general description of what I wanted and left with a much better style than I had anticipated. He payed close attention to detail and I was very pleased with the result. This is definitely where I will be going from now on.

I love this place. I come here for all accessories or repairs on my bike, which I bought there. The same guy is always working and I believe his name is Dale. Great customer service, takes time to answer questions, and does an awesome job all around!

I love their products, especially their "Rockstar" soap and "Big" shampoo.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful, however, they ask if you'd like to try everything which is overwhelming when you know what you are going in to get. Also, the smell of this place when you walk in or even walk by really hits you in the face.

I just got a really great smoothie here, however the two girls working were very rude. Also, this place has a strange and disconcerting sour scent that I find unidentifiable to my olfactory perception. I looked past this smell at first and went on putting yogurt in my cup and dumping various fruits on it. I bring my smoothie cup up to pay and she asks in a monotone voice if I want it mixed. Well, no shit. Then she took my cup and disappeared for 5 minutes only to return with a half filled cup of poorly blended deliciousness.

I'm not a huge fan of frozen yogurt, but this place is close to where I live and has a great environment. The pricing is extremely affordable especially for the quality. As for the yogurt, I usually go for the coconut. The fruit toppings are all very fresh especially in comparison to other yogurt shops in this area. The workers are always pretty friendly and have smiles on their faces. It's colorful inside and they've got water coolers with strawberries floating around inside!

Had a broken screen and digitizer on my  Samsung Galaxy S5 and brought it in 35 minutes before they closed. They fixed it in 30 minutes and I was able to pick it up right away. Also, they were $40 cheaper than other cell phone repair shops in the area.
