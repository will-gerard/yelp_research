Dr. Mancuso was referred to me by my son's  pediatrician.  My son is 13.  He was battling chronic sinus headaches, so bad he couldn't  focus at school or get out of bed.  We had to wait a few weeks to actually be seen by Dr. Mancuso.  We had a CT which showed ethmoid sinus disease.  When he came into the room too see us, the first words out of his mouth were "I don't think I am going to be able to help you."  Really?  Then he examined my son with a tiny scope through the nose and told us there was nothing wrong with him, no congestion, no deviated septum, etc.  He referred us to a neurologist and told me to get my son a psychologist.   Luckily I did not listen to Dr. Mancuso, and listened to my son instead.  We got a second opinion at a different ENT office and my son had surgery to fix the blockage in his ethmoid sinus and does not battle the chronic headaches he was having.  Glad his problem got resolved, sadly not by Dr. Mancuso.

This office staff and doctors are great!  My kids don't mind coming here.  It is inviting, the doctors and staff are nice, and Dr. Smith and Dr. Kent are great with my boys.  They are busy, and a couple times we have been directed to other locations for same day appointments, but we like everyone we have had to see so far.

Brought our dog here.  Doc seemed to know the problem with our dogs leg without having to take x-rays.  Our dog needs surgery.  It will cost a lot, and they do take Care Credit to help with paying for expenses such as this.  We were not approved for the financing, so unfortunately have to go somewhere that will take payments.  Otherwise, everyone was nice and they got us in right away.

Stopped in tonight.  It's the day after Christmas, and I am not the only one in the area sick of the Christmas feast.  I walked in to find a very busy restaurant, but service was still good.  There were many people working hard, never skipping a beat it seemed.  I ordered cashew chicken and sweet and sour shrimp, with fried rice.  Pretty delicious.  The shrimp were a good size and the cashew chicken was a huge portion.  Good flavor and well worth the wait.  I will definitely be trying this place again!

Hubby got 2 tires and a spare for a great price, and great service.  Coworker went a few weeks later and also had a great experience.  I wish we knew about this place sooner!

This place is pretty great!  My favorite is the chicken pesto pizza.  I had not tried a pesto pizza before, and omg...delish!!!  You can stop in for pizza by the slice for just a couple bucks, or order an entire pizza to your liking.  You can't go too wrong here!

We wanted to try this place based on the good reviews.  The building is really cool, as well as the surrounding area.  Inside, on a Friday night, the place was packed.   The restaurant is cafeteria style and the line went from the back to the front of the restaurant.  Plenty of seating and a huge tractor inside.  We tried the homemade rootbeer, which seemed overly sweet.  I think I'll stick with Barq's.  I tried the brisket and the chicken breast.  Brisket was descent.  Chicken was terrible.  It had an odd flavor, not to my liking.  My husband  said the sausage wasn't good.  My son said his ribs weren't that good.  The beans were amazing and filled with lots of meat, so that had to be my favorite part.  Oddly, the bread and the cheesy potatoes both had jalapenos in them, so both of the kids wouldn't eat either one.  The best part for my 5 yr. old was the chocolate chip cookie that came with his meal.  Probably won't be back with the family.  I was actually disappointed that most of the actual BBQ didn't taste that great.

We moved here from CA, where we had Verizon Fios, which was amazing.  We had Cox turned on here based on a recommendation from our landlord.  It's more expensive, we have way less channels (even though we pay way more), and it never works...EVER!  I have had a technician come out 5 times within the last year to fix what the previous techs mess up.  I have had to have boxes switched out at the Cox store twice.  I have had to have billing adjustments done because they never bill properly, and at least twice a week I have to reset my wifi box because the wifi goes out.  Customer service is nice once you get them on the phone, but it is so cookie cutter.  I have similar issues every time.  They ask that I do the same things every time to find a solution.  I am tired of this.  I read reviews about the competition and it doesn't sound any better.  Ugh.

Saw a movie here today in the Cine Capri.  The sound is amazing, and the cost to see such a large screen isn't bad either.  Would definitely recommend seeing your next movie here!

I have been here for lunch and dinner with the family.  It's very reasonable, considering all the food that you get.  It usually runs a little over 30.00 for the 4 of us, and includes the stir fry, all you can eat soup and rice, fountain drinks or tea and the dinner menu includes ice cream for dessert.  I love that each of us can create our own bowl and include the meats and veggies that we each like.  It is great for our picky kids.

We came in this afternoon and were seated within a couple of minutes.  The service here was not bad, although not great either.  The staff seemed like they were going through the motions.  I feel like their high prices did not match the level of customer service.  The biscuits they served were way too dry, even with the bitter apple butter that came with them.   We ordered the tri tip, the catfish, and the beef brisket, along with a kids meal.  The kids meal was great, the rest of the meals were just way overpriced bbq.  The sauce they use isn't anything special.  Seriously not really impressed.  I wanted to love it, but can name at least 3 other bbq restaurants I would rather go to.

We stopped here literally just passing through on our way back to Chandler, AZ.  I wouldn't consider going there if I wasn't passing through on my way to somewhere else, but having seen something last over 700 years is quite remarkable!  There is a $5 fee to see it which is totally worth it since it allows them to preserve it.  It is hot, so bring water and sunscreen, and enjoy!

We took our kids here for my son's 13th birthday dinner.  There was a man making balloon figures, and made our son a birthday crown.  Also made the 5 yr. old a spiderman balloon.  Our waitress was nice and very attentive even though they were extremely busy.  Food was amazing!  They made the steaks perfectly and have the best cesar salad ever!  They make their own dressing, steak sauce, even croutons!!!  At the end of the night they made a shout out, announcing my son's birthday and let him sit on a saddle for a photo-op.  All-in-all, a great night and a fantastic meal!

Shoe Carnival always has great deals and a pretty good selection compared to their competition.  They have typical bogo promos frequently and a pretty good selection for men, women, and kids.

We LOVE this place!  The sushi comes around pretty quickly, so if it passes you up it won't be too long until it comes around again.  Everything seems really fresh, and has great flavor.  Every plate is $2 and worth every penny.  The service is spot on!  I would recommend trying it out!

I visited this office once, several months ago.  I needed a few moles removed.  Pretty simple procedure.  The day of my appointment I felt as if I got pretty good care.  I waited about 30 minutes before being called back.  I did not actually see the doctor but saw a PA.  She was nice.  Looked over my face, head, and upper body for moles and stuff.  I had a group of moles cut off.  I questioned why they weren't being burned off and she said they could be cut off and would take care of it.  I went along with the procedure and was sent home.  The area the moles were cut from was sensitive and I experienced quite a bit of pain, which I would assume is because of the sensitive area they were removed from.  The area took about a week to heal.    Fast forward several months.  The 3 moles that were removed were not removed completely.  There was one rather large one, and 2 small ones.  All 3 spots still have part of the mole remaining.  I have had moles removed before by having them burned off and have never had any part remaining.  I am pretty disappointed because my copay is $75 and I don't want to have to return a second time and pay again for something that I feel should have been done correctly the 1st time.  Plus, I don't want to experience the pain and irritation all over again.

Always great beer on tap!  My favorite is Little Guy Rye.  Always good service and the food is delicious too.  If it is your birthday, expect a really large beer for a very small price!  It's a pretty cool place to hang out, either inside or on the patio with misters to keep you cool with the hot AZ days.  Definitely gotta try it!

This Winco has a sushi stand where they make fresh sushi, just like many Fry's stores, but the pieces of fish are bigger and better at this Winco.  I like the bulk stuff, and it is one of the only places that sells chocolate covered gummy bears!!!  Produce prices are usually pretty good!  You do have to bag your own groceries, but the setup is nice.  Seems there are not many registers open at one time, but they do have a self checkout.

Have used this urgent care several times for my husband, children and myself.  We have seen the doctor and the PA and both are great!  We have always been seen within a reasonable amount of time.  No complaints here!

I called to place an order for an office luncheon, and was told they were not taking phone orders.  Jared was the person that took the call.  I informed him that I was sending in someone else to pick the food up and asked if he could at least write it down so that when the other person came in, they would know what they were getting.  Everything was on point!  She went to pick up the food and said everyone was very nice in assisting her to get what I had ordered.  The food was delicious, and plenty of it!  The Churros....delicious!!!  Very happy today for such a nice change to the typical food in Ahwatukee.  Will be back for more office luncheons for sure!
