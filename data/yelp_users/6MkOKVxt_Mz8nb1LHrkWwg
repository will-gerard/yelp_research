I have always been a huge fan and have sent lots of people there. But that has all changed. The staff is incredibly rude, the manager Cameron has no customer service skills and yelled at customers. There used to be a friendly staff, this place is getting to have a bad reputation. When I was there I heard severs cussing and complaining about their tables....right infront of everyone!! I will NEVER go back to the Scottsdale location inless the staff gets better, as of now Chandler still has my business.

Love this place! Best Pho in Downtown Phoenix! I eat here at least once a week. Parking could be better but that the price you pay for dining downtown.

Love the one in Phoenix but the service here is horrible. Waited 40 minutes for table (mind you they were not busy) I received a text at 3:25 that the table was ready and didn't even get seated until 3:40. I asked to speak with a manager ... James came over and apologized and said he would make sure the food came fast. I was in the service industry for 5 years he could have at least offered an appetizer or small discount. I love Fox Restaurant but I will never come back to this location. They were more than staffed to handle this volume and they seriously need to get it together. I witnessed two other complaints.
