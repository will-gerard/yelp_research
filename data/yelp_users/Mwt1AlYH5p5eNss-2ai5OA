Where did this place come from? It went from being a little red building that I would pass on the side of the road from time to time over to Wong's, the almighty Chinese food joint. I knew it was a restaurant but I probably wouldn't have stopped unless it were for my co-workers who were going one day and asked if I wanted to go. I am so thankful I said "Yes!".  It is a dive. You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the head and you could probably convert the entire place to a motorcycle shop in less than an hour. Extra beverages are stacked against the wall, the tables are small, and the air conditioning is probably in need of a service call. All part of the ambiance! The menu isn't a surprise. When I visit a new Chinese place my first meal is always sweet and sour pork. This way I can get a bead on the same meals and see how they handle the basics. Like most other Chinese restaurant lunch entrees, Wong's lunch comes with an egg roll and rice. In this case it was sticky white rice. Crunchy, drippy sumptuous sweet and suckling sour chicken. It ranks up there with some of the best for certain. The rice was a wonderful mix of sticky and fluffy. I like to eat with chopsticks when possible and this rice was definitely edible with the primitive yet effective utensils. Back and for between the awesome chicken and rice to finally the egg roll. Crispy almost flaky wrapper with an almost too finely minced filling of pork, cabbage, and carrots. The three simply complimented one another throughout the entire lunch. So, so good.    Wong's is EXACTLY why you don't go to a chain and why you don't continue to drive past that place you have seen a million times but never was curious enough to actually stop and dine. The prices are super reasonable to boot. Have I been burned by places like this? Yes, but the few duds are heavily outweighed by other good places and certainly by great places like this. Stop the next time you are driving by if this place looks sketchy, scary, or outright out of place. Because it is but inside they are serving delicious food.

I wish I knew more about Mexican food. It would let me know what I was talking about when I was to demean restaurants such as this one when they claim they serve Mexican food.  Maybe I am expecting to much going to a chain but shouldn't I at least deserve mediocrity?  When the first thing you serve me is under cooked chips and place them on my table with what is best described as thimble sized portions of completely ordinary salsa, then we are off to a rough start.  Maybe the Mexican aspect of the restaurant comes from the fact that I needed to speak Spanish to order. I finally convinced the waiter of my order which was to be chicken quesadilla. The soda machine must have been non functional the day I ate at this location because I only received 2 drinks during my visit. When the quesadilla arrived I wished I had just gone to Taco Bell which I had originally contemplated before parking for Chevy's. The tortilla and cheese was standard fare but the chicken must have just come from the freezer. Bland, dry, and I could barely believe it was there.   No more ignoring ratings. I joined Yelp to let fellow food connoisseurs guide me in my dining experiences and I ignored them this time. For this, I apologize. I hereby declare from this day forward I will stop going against your recommendations and follow your advice. This experience taught me you all know what you are talking about!

Today I went to this Cheesecake Factory for brunch. An event was being coordinated by the Wounded Warrior Project organization and I was to meet with other wounded warriors for a little what I thought was a meet and greet. Once I met the coordinator, she mentioned there were to be 70 attendees. Yes. Seven, zero. I braced myself for the worst.  At the strike of ten the doors opened and the games began. But what happened threw me off in a good way. The manager asked for the party of 70 right off the bat and immediately had us seated in a very large area of the restaurant designated just for our event. Servers were swarming, the manager was always present, water pitchers were pouring.  Good things were happening and I was truly impressed. I don't know if they had a pep talk in the back before we came in the door and said something like,"There is a group of 70 combat injured guests and their families coming in today. Get them whatever they want and do whatever they ask" because that is exactly what I felt like was happening. First class service.  Now the food. I grabbed the Monte Cristo brunch sandwich which was egg, ham, bacon, and Swiss cheese between two thick pieces of French toast and dusted with powdered sugar. It was just as salty and sweet as you can imagine it was. It was in fact to sweet for me. Thankfully, my wife was having the Baja Chicken Hash meal which was "Two Crisp Tortillas Topped with Chicken Chorizo, Poblano Chiles, Potatoes, Corn, Peppers, Onions and Cheese. Topped with Eggs and Hollandaise Sauce."  I copied that from the website so hopefully they don't care but I can't explain all of what was in the meal. It was simply awesome. It was spicy and hearty with the hash browns and I loved it. So my wife and I switched dishes and were officially set. My daughter had a three pancake and bacon meal which she loved. Simple palate simply pleased. One thing to note. The orange juice was truly fresh squeezed and along with the pulp even had that slight bitter rind taste to go with it. The virtual cherry on top of the breakfast. Really, truly, good.  It all really came together. 70 of us sat down and there was not a single beat missed by the staff this morning. My coffee and water never went empty. My food came promptly piping hot and tasty. There was a smile on everybody's face and I met some other great Americans and their families. I have been to this Cheesecake Factory in the past and had good service but maybe a little unremarkable. Today was an opportunity for this location to shine and indeed it did.

I had been going here for years but then moved out of the area.  After moving back I have been going back to Lenny's a little bit here and there.  Today when I asked my wife what she wanted for lunch, and she said Lenny's, I was happy.  I would usually go with 4 stars for a place like this because the food is that good in my opinion but I am just tacking on the extra one this time for the nostalgia.  Does nostalgia make food taste better you ask?  You're darn right it does.  Two single country burgers, a single order of chili cheese fries, and a vanilla shake later I was back in high school and college all over again.  I really hate going back to my old dives because I am afraid they are not going to live up to my memories as some have and been scratched off the list.  But Lenny's lived up to that and more today.    You just can't beat how small and packed it gets.  People lined up out the door around noon each day, waiting for their food, barely being able to keep up with the filling of drinks and ketchup cups.  But it happens like clockwork just as I have remembered.  But truly, the food is pretty darn good and it has stood the test of time.    I can't wait to go back.  P.S. Does anyone know what the Lenny's wi-fi was about?  It was locked down but why even broadcast it?  Can you pay for wi-fi there?

I have been going to Captain Bill's since I could drive, so over 15 years. When I lived in the area I would make excuses to go over there as much as possible. Let's see why it has all the right ingredients for an awesome sandwich shop.  Great bread, delicious meats, fresh vegetables. All the essentials are present and this place puts them altogether in the right order. I have had over a dozen types of sandwiches and they are all outstanding. In fact, I would just have to describe the sandwiches I only ate once or twice as less outstanding, but not less than outstanding. That barely made sense but I think you get what I am saying. My last trip they either made up a new sandwich or I just missed it over the last decade. Buffalo chicken sandwich. Yes, you just drooled a little. It tasted as I had suspected, amazing, but I will have to warn you that it had a little more heat than I anticipated. I am okay with it but somebody else might not like it a little more on the spicy side. So I recommend it for certain. What is strange is that I usually order the BLT. It is so basic and I can make those at home but for some reason Captain Bill's just makes a damn good BLT.  Time for a little truth out of me. Part of the appeal of Captain Bill's was the sandwich girls. It seems as though the Captain didn't hire unattractive help. The attractive help hasn't changed but what has changed is my age so now that I am married it is just a little creepy of me to notice these things. Or I am just a guy. Either way the younger crowd will enjoy the staffing scenery. Don't tell my wife I just said that...  Great sandwiches and the admittedly lovely and capable staff come together in a great sandwich shop with great prices. They have stood the test of time and if you are within a 5 mile radius of this place and you still go to a Subway, you should question why you are even on a site like Yelp and actually care about your food. Captain Bill's is also a very entertaining place to eat. Once you get there, you will understand what I mean.

I have been going to this awesome little pizza joint for over 20 years.  It might not be as long as some others who have reviewed this restaurant but I think it is enough to say I have eaten here a few times before.  The first thing I started eating was very simple, pizza and wings.  It really is a great combo and I have never been disappointed.  Cheese to the works will surely satisfy.  My wife likes getting sausage and mushroom while I am just fine with a pepperoni topping.  I have to say whatever we get I really don't mind because it will be good.  The wings are just as good as the pizza.  They are well cooked, the sauces are graded just right between the desired flavor and heat and just like the pizza they have never disappointed.  Don't question if you should get them, just how many.  After a few years of pizza and wings I looked up one day while at the counter and noticed they had a menu!  On that menu is everything you can think of in a pizzeria style restaurant.  Subs, salads, calzones, fried cheese sticks, and the list goes on.  I will only touch on a couple of items.  The next thing I really was addicted to was the steak and cheese.  I started eating them with mushrooms and peppers but over time I ended eating them with just the steak and cheese.  Hot, delicious steak, perfectly melted cheese all stuffed into wonderful bread which is then toasted at the end.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  I also have been known to get a calzone from time to time.  I have had them all and each is about the size of a couch cushion.  I have never been able to finish one in a single sitting but the flavor really tempts you to try.  No bother; take it home and finish it when your appetite returns.  Reheating is a sin but not taking the rest home to finish it is a bigger sin.  I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the family that runs the restaurant.  Having gone here for over 15 years I have grown with them almost.  I have literally seen their children grow up and now a few of them can be seen behind the counter giving you the same great service I have known all this time.  Those who go enough know that you get a little extra conversation when you walk through the doors.  I try and understand everything they say but I rarely get everything between the thick accents.  Overall a great place to go get your meal.  Lunch or dinner, alone or with the family, you will get great food.  I have a warning though; you may not want to go to Pizza by Napoli if you live far away.  I moved away and now have to drive 20 miles to get my old favorite.  Small price to pay.

I will start by saying that I don't know Mexican food. I put that disclaimer up so that if anyone ever reads these small insignificant little critiques of mine, I can always point to the claim I have no idea what truly this stuff is supposed to taste like because I am not a chef or even a professional. I work in IT for Pete's sake. With that said, this place was one of a kind. I may have only gone one time but that was all I needed.  The building is big, purple, and on the corner right on 24th Street. Talk about location. There is only about 8 parking spaces behind the place but not a worry because we were the first ones there for lunch. Your experience may vary. Inside is way more romanticly themed for 4 guys from work out on their lunch break. Small table, candles, I am not going to say more for fear of my sexuality being questioned. We were seated immediately and had ice water within moments. We ordered a plate of chips and salsa to wet the appetite. They brought us an entire plate covered in guacamole with freshly made chips individually stuck in it. This was a good signal of what was to come.  Fairly basic menu. Spanish terms that I can't easily pronounce. So I ordered what could best be described as a steak quesadilla but in this particular quesadilla was Chihuahua cheese. I have never heard of it before but once I tasted it I realized it is certainly something I won't soon forget. It is a creamy, mellow, and simply delicious cheese. Put that between a nice fresh tortilla and some savory steak and there you have a really great lunch. The only thing I can think of to ding the meal on was portion size. I by no means am a big eater. Quality over quantity all day long. But I could have used a little more to fill me up. Nitpicking, I am.  Go here. Eat lunch or dinner or whatever is appropriate for the time of day you are there. The staff truly care about your meal and your experience. The chef came out and asked us how it was and I never had a half empty glass much less a totally empty glass of tea. The host even unfolded our napkins and placed them on our lap. I have no idea if that is a cultural tradition or not, but it was very pleasant. I shall be back indeed.

This is the first time I have had someone ask me if I wanted to go to lunch and get some macaroons. I guess you could make a meal out of them. I would probably be pretty upset later for making that decision, though. After asking for clarification that someone told me that his destination of choice, Essence Bakery Cafe, was more than just a macaroon shop. It certainly was in so many ways. The impetus of the Essence lunch outing was for macaroons, admittedly. But after looking at their menu online it looks as though I was going to be able to get a good lunch while running this co-worker's errand. The Essence name went as far as to having another co-worker get on board for the lunch with great enthusiasm. I guess I was in for a treat.  When we arrived I was surprised to see that it was a simple little location in an unassuming store front off University Avenue. Parking was limited but I was lucky enough to score a spot up front next to a Subaru Forester which was much more fortuitous than I gave it credit for at the time. I immediately noted the activity of several people in and outside of Essence apparently already enjoying their visit. I guess arriving early might not be enough. Upon entering, I started this small experience.  Up front there is a small display case full of pastries, macaroons, and other baked goods. For a bakery, not a huge display but a good representation nonetheless. Personally I was here just for lunch after all. Having read the menu online already I was able to observe more closely the environment before ordering my predetermined meal. Smaller dining area with standard table and chair configuration with about 25% of capacity already taken by 1100 when we arrived. Two sides of the establishment are windowed so enough light poured through to feel inviting. I ordered the chicken club and took a seat.  The sandwich was pretty good. Noticeably fresh ingredients, good portions, excellent taste. The French Dijon potato side was also pretty good. Not exactly my normal style of potato salad but I won't knock it due to its freshness and taste. My fellow diners that were with me also enjoyed their meals quite a bit as well from what they said. I also tasted a chocolate chip pastry (that actual name of it eludes me currently but it was a type of croissant I believe) and it was very rich and delicious as well. A pretty good meal overall.  For an off the cuff lunch decision, Essence was a delightful experience. I wouldn't make it a weekly visit and it wouldn't personally go on my top choices simply because of its distance from my place of work. But I would encourage anyone to visit it to see what they think.

Tough call with the 4 or 5 star rating.  Let me explain.  I would give this Sardella's a five star rating due to my most recent experience.  Every year my family goes to this Sardella's to celebrate my wife's and my birthday with our immediate family (parents, brothers, sisters...) and there is usually enough room somewhere to fit a party of around 10-12.  They are very accomodating.  This recent trip we were enjoying our pizza and wings when one of the employees brings us an order of their cinna-bread which apparently they made in error so they simply gave it to us on the house.  We were very gracious as we were just finishing up the pizza and wings and had not ordered a dessert.  One bite of this cinna-bread said it all.  It was over the top, doughy, sugar laden, cinnamon sprinkled, crisscrossed icing heaven.  The entire family was overwhelmed with its taste in a good way.  Let's just say I recommend it.    I give the four star because I simply can't give 5 for one experience but if there were a 4.5, I would solidly put it there.  The pizza is always good and the wings NEVER disappoint.  The people who work there are great and I have never had a bad experience with the service.  Ingredients are fresh as pizza joints go and I have been told by my family that the salads are fresh and tasty.  I have no clue because who eats salad at a pizza place like this?!  Great food and family times.  Where is that 4.5 star rating?!

Why can't my daughter beg to go to Peter Piper Pizza?  I wouldn't like Chuck E Cheese even if the staff was friendly, the food was good, and the games actually worked.  But if all of those were true, I would at least give it a higher star rating. But seeing as how each of those categories were a disastrous mess, I am confident in giving the one star rating.  I am all about rewarding my daughter when she does well. She has been doing splendidly getting ready for her first day of school and I wanted to take her anywhere she wanted to go to let her know we appreciate her hard work. When she wanted to go to Chuck E Cheese, I felt the low grumbling sigh emerging.  I do have to give credit to the idea of stamping the family with identical infrared markings to deter those who wish to impose ill will on our little ones. But that is about the end of the good will I will project to the staff. If you are hungry or thirsty and want something quickly, then be prepared to wait. I timed my wait for a simple drink; it ran about 4:15. I don't know if it is short staffing or paying slave wages to high schoolers who simply don't care. Either way, the combination they have just isn't working.  The only thing worse than the slow service to get your food is the food itself. It is horrible. I don't know any other descriptors to really describe cheap cheese layered on tomato paste that is all resting on what amounts to pressed together Wonder Bread. I would describe the wings but I don't technically ever want to call them wings because that is an insult to all other wings created. Ever. I referenced Peter Piper earlier and even though Peter Piper's pizza isn't exactly gourmet, it blows this pizza clean out of the water. No comparison. I can't talk about their food any more, it makes my stomach sad.  The coux de gras is the games. If it all came down to just going in to play some games with the family, then you will again be completely disappointed. Almost half of the games either didn't work or would eat your tokens without actually working. It was simply just sad. The games that did work were about as badly maintained as any I have ever seen. I actually felt bad for my family at one point because what was supposed to be an eventful afternoon turned into a pitiful experience.

I have to write this down immediately. And I am going to do something I typically don't which is include personal information about myself. But in order to give full comprehension, I will be talking about my family. To me, it's worth it in my book for this one...  My wife and I don't get out much. Busy lives, work, family, etc. We have been passing over anniversaries, birthdays, unexpected (but wanted!) pregnancy, and all other special occasions because of time. We recently purchased a home (buying a home and moving=no time) and after spending somewhere in the neighborhood of a quarter of a million dollars, the builder gave us a $50 gift card to Fleming's. Finally! A chance to go celebrate all of these passed over dates of significance! Ship the daughter off to grandma's, pull out some extra cash, and make the reservation.  We arrived at our reservation time and were seated immediately. The hostess was friendly and politely chatted with us as she seated us at a nice table pretty much in the middle of main dining area. Comfortable chairs, nice lighting, fairly intimate setting. We knew what the menu held after reviewing it online first so we knew we were starting with the crab cakes. After ordering the crab cakes, my wife and I started to slow down and get into the date night vibe. The crab cakes were moist, flavorful, and served in a very savory butter sauce. I couldn't put my finger on the spices in the sauce but it was delectable. We are off to a good start. I ordered a boneless ribeye with king crab and mashed potatoes while my wife went for the petite filet with asparagus. The steak was outstanding. Not too salty, medium rare to perfection, juices still inside and on the plate. If I were a cow, I would be honored to be this steak postmortem. The accompanying crab was also sumptuous. My wife was gracious enough to let me try a bite of her filet and it certainly didn't disappoint. Typically I would finish what she started but my lovely better half is very pregnant so I no longer enjoy the luxury of counting on her leftovers. As a matter of fact, I lost some of my potatoes in the ordeal. Easy sacrifice to keep all of my steak. All the food was impressive.   But this is when things went from impressive to outstanding. One of the managers stops by our table and drops off a $25 gift certificate because our hostess had gleaned the purpose of our night out while she was seating us. She relayed that to the manager which prompted the gift certificate. I elaborated slightly on how it was actually making up for several occasions and he was on his way after a gracious conversation. At the end of our meal, our server then brings us a small box of chocolates with a candle on it and two cards. One card was for the anniversary we were celebrating and the other was for the acknowledgement of our impending new child each signed by the staff. The server then lights the candle and thanks us for celebrating with them. We take a small bite from the rich chocolate delights in the box and saved the rest for later.  I felt special this night. I truly feel like the staff of Fleming's appreciated our visit and were happy we chose to celebrate at their restaurant. The entire night my wife and I were looking at each other in awe of how efficient and caring the staff was. Whether it was how they constantly were topping off our drinks or the management stop by's to check on us. But when you go that far out of normal to deliver hand signed Congratulations cards, you just outdid almost every establishment I have ever been to. One might say this should be expected from a finer dining place such as this, but I have had much less expensive establishments create an experience such as this one. This type of service transcends money. Well done Fleming's. You made the customer number one in your service and meals. My wife and I had a night that we will remember for a very long time to come.

Please, someone tell me, how does this place even post a profit. Ever?  I live down the road and since I was a child I had never heard of Kohl's.  And when came in down the road, it was described to me as a cross between a Dillard's and a Mervyn's.  This didn't bode well for this new establishment. I was pretty sure I was going to buy socks, and maybe underwear here, and call it a deal. Boy, was I wrong.  The first time I knew I was missing out is when my wife bought me a bunch of clothes (yeah, my wife buys some of my clothes. I admit it) and I started wearing them and they weren't just very affordable, they were also very much my style. Casual, generic, and comfortable beyond all description. I had to know what this place looked like in person. It had to have tossed clothing racks, rancid dressing rooms, horrible service. DAMN! Foiled again.   Now, I am writing this review about 5 years after this place has been around so this is about 4 years of experiences at this location. The racks are always, for the most part, clean and tidy. The organization is methodical and predictable. The clothes are a very good bargain. I am not talking super high end stuff for a good price. I am talking proprietary clothing at an outstanding price. Generic silk screen shirts, sturdy jeans, quality socks. This isn't Rodeo drive people, but they do have some nicer clothes that I have purchased for interviews and weddings. Good clothing, period.  This brings me to the price. I guess I don't know the first thing about running a large chain of retail clothing. I will admit this. But how can you throw down $150 worth of clothing on the check out counter and after red tags, special discount days, mailed coupons, Arbor Day, and just because discounts, I am paying around $85. I don't think Kohl's sells surplus clothing like Costco and Sam's but if it is then I truly can't tell. And however they do it, I don't care. The prices is how this store earned that extra star on the end. I will go back for pretty much everything short of suits and scuba gear.  I can't end this without talking about the staff. Always friendly and knowledgeable. The returns are lenient if you just are happy with your purchase. They will give you a little good conversation while you are checking out and they really keep the store in good shape overall.  Bravo.

I felt compelled to write a review for this particular Subway location. The food is the same as expected but the employees are the exception. I always forget to write down the names of the gentlemen that work there but they are the reason I go back again and again.   My daughter loves Subway already but these guys will make whatever crazy sandwich she wants that day where other locations will only create to the already set sandwich menu. They smile and laugh each time but are always willing to make it to order for her.  If you like Subway and think outside the sandwich box, I am sure these gentleman can keep up. Well done.

What do you get when you cross a pizza with a buffalo wing. You get a buffalo chicken pizza. This was exactly what I was promised at this little pizza shop right off the 101. It is a pretty good slice of pie and I can only imagine it is true New York style considering I have not been to New York before. It has some heat to it, flavor was good, and the crust was pretty good. It exceeded my expectations probably because every buffalo chicken pizza I have had up until that point was pretty horrible. I guess low expectations are easier to exceed than high ones. I also had a slice of pepperoni along with the buffalo chicken type. It was pretty good as well. I am not calling it the best in town but it was flavorful.  A couple notes here. One, the value is pretty good for the lunch menu. I didn't peek around for dinner menus for the other things that included full pizzas and sandwiches. Two, when I went there was a gentlemen at the table closest to the service counter. He had a newspaper spread out over the entire table, two plates of food, and didn't appear to have anywhere to be. He would call out to Stevie over the counter from time to time to ask him about his business or one of his employees. They talked with a thick accent so I assume they were both from New York. I guess I was thrown off because apparently in New York they are okay with one person occupying a four person table during a lunch hour rush and forcing others to sit everywhere but there.

Today Nino's earned their fifth star. I had them at a solid 4 but the fifth was earned rightly. It's not that I was on the fence but I will have to elaborate a little further for this to make any sense.  To start off, the food here is very good. I haven't had anything other than their pizza and wings but I think any place that pins themselves as a pizza joint can be measured by those two alone so I am going to roll with it. The pizza is simply flavorful and fresh. The crust is crunchy and not oily while the cheese is delicious and all of the toppings we have had were equally of good quality. We have been there a few times now and I was waiting to see if there was ever any variance which sometimes happens in smaller joints like this, but the quality has been very consistent.   The wings are different. I don't know how else to say that because they aren't the usual fried wing slathered in the sauce of your choice. I actually don't know how they do it but they are crispy and for the most part dry with the flavor of wing sauce still there. It's almost as if they put the wings in the sauce then fried them thus baking in the flavor. It is the only place I have had wings like this and frankly it is good. My wife is the one who, upon our first visit to Nino's, threw down 10 in one sitting. Let's just say she is a fan because she rarely eats more than 3 wings from any other pizza joint. They aren't my favorite but they are definitely good. I am going to give them points for originality in this category which doesn't happen very often.  The facility itself is a simple little corner spot right on 99th and Olive. Nothing special other than I would say location probably gets them some pretty good exposure. Walk in, register and the bar with a few televisions on the right, and tables all along the left. Very small town feel in a big city. Wood paneled wall and a NASCAR trinket here and there as well. I haven't been enough to identify the patrons at the bar each time but I get the feeling this place has its regulars.   And now to that fifth star. It comes down to the staff, really. I had a request for a quarter of the pizza to not have pizza sauce due to allergies in the family (to tomatoes, not pizza sauce itself, silly). At first I was put off because the person on the phone acted like that was the most outlandish request they had ever heard. I have never been to a place that couldn't do it so I was a little surprised when he sounded like this was difficult. But the kudos comes for the result. They figured it out. There were 2 slices with just dough and cheese and the recipient was delighted they could pull it off. I could have gone two ways with this I think. This could have been a negative for a fairly normal task being made in to such a big deal. But I am going to side with the cook here. He may never have done such a task before, but he stepped up and did it which is why we will be going back for more pizza and wings for as long as they are slinging them.

New Year! New House! New breakfast burritos! To say I was worried about Mexican food in my area after our move is an understatement. I need some sort of burrito factory within a reasonable distance or else why even exist? Our old Ramiro's was pretty good at slinging sour cream and guacamole infused delights so my hunt for its replacement was actually done before the move even commenced. I mean, what great General goes into battle without a well thought out strategy?  Rivas is actually closer than the aforementioned Ramiro's was to our previous residence. Things are starting well. I drove up this morning with one thing in mind; breakfast burritos. Steak, egg, cheese, and potato burritos to be specific. The drive through was pretty standard if not a little cramped but I drive a compact car so this wasn't an obstacle. From order to pick up window was pretty standard, possibly a little faster than average. Price is also average for an establishment like this. So far so good.  The drive home with this type of payload is always horrible. I drive a manual transmission so even trying to single fist a burrito would be a bad idea. These things smelled delish. Upon arriving home, unwrapping, and taking that first bite, my suspicions were confirmed. We have a new burrito place! It was a hot, flavorful party in my mouth and everyone was invited. The steak was a little different flavor than what I was used to due to the spices I assume. But it was a good flavor so I didn't mind a bit. I finished about 3/4 of this sizable meal in a tortilla until I had to tap out. I wanted to go on, but my body said no. Rewrapped and back into the fridge with you, ole' boy! You have just become lunch!  Wrapped food delivery systems are efficient. Arguably a better food system than the almighty sandwich. Remind you I said arguable. Much like sandwiches, though, burritos can be thrown together by just about anyone but that doesn't make it good. Rivas has shown they have what it takes in this field. I see a beautiful relationship developing here.

I used to frequent the Buffalo Wild Wings on Litchfield and Bell and never had a bad experience.  Whether it was fight night on a Saturday evening or a lazy Tuesday dinner, I never was worried about the overall experience at that location.  This location, on the other hand, could take some hints from there now defunct location to the west.  I have been to this location 4 times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.  I won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.  On multiple occasions a buddy of mine who I went with each time felt compelled to recite Reservoir Dogs lines when it came to drink refills.  They were few and far between.  Finally, I don't sit at the bar because I like to speak with the company I am in, but that was virtually impossible.  This wasn't just on event nights either.  The volume of the speakers didn't vary anytime, not even in the middle of the week during lunch.  I want a good Buffalo Wild Wings in my area badly.  I have to travel to get to this location and would happily if they delivered on what I was used to.  I guess I am off to find another of the few that are actually still open until I see this location pick up its game.

I will just start by saying I really like this place. I have no reservations going here for lunch or taking my family out to eat. I have been here by myself and with extended family on several occasions and the quality of food and the staff is consistent.  Barro's pizza is second to none. At least for me that is. It isn't my wife's favorite but she knows I like it so much that she takes one for the team for my sake. All of the pizzas I have had from pepperoni to the works type are very good. Fresh, good ingredients, a little more sauce than other pizza joints make for an awesome pie. Please don't go here and buy a salad. That would completely negate the awesome which is waiting to be made for you.  The other options are also rather good as well. The wings are not my favorite but they are still very good. They are bigger than most wings in the area and the sauce is thicker and stickier than comparable wings as well. They aren't the style I usually prefer but they are big and meaty nonetheless. The flavor is good and the heat is predictable depending on the grade you select. The salad bar always has fresh ingredients if that is your persuasion. I have had one before and they have some good dressings as well. Thankfully, my wife really likes to eat the salad while I devour the pizza she doesn't care for very much.  It's a great little pizza place. Good service, good food, good location and ambiance. Booths and large tables for lots of people or little tables for a quick lunch. I would definitely recommend.

I typically wouldn't take family to a restaurant that has an overall 3 star Yelp rating. It's not that I blindly trust everyone here, but I have found that overall it is pretty spot on and why take family to a 3 star location? Well, in this case I took a risk and was able to nervously exhale very early in the experience.  Like I said, I had family from out of town in and we didn't want to drive all the way to Arrowhead for Italian food. We had seen the Twisted Italian before but were skeptical. Once in through the front doors, I immediately had to adjust my preconceptions. The Twisted Italian is much more family oriented than I had thought. Very well lit, larger tables, very open. I guess I never really looked through the window to see what was inside. We were seated immediately which scared me for a Saturday night. Did everyone else know something we didn't?  Our waitress came over fairly quick and we had our drinks in a very short time after she took the requests. We ordered some bruschetta for an appetizer even though we all noticed it had honey drizzled on it. The waitress came back after putting our appetizer order in to get our main order. There were 6 of us and she took each of our orders without writing a thing down. Not ever being in that industry, it scared me. I shouldn't assume everyone else has my horrible memory. The bruschetta came and it was pretty good. Fresh chopped vegetables, good crumbled cheese, and drizzled honey. Unfortunately, the honey did detract from the classic bruschetta flavor I was looking for, but I won't ding them for it because I went into it eyes open. My penne alfredo with sausage arrived piping hot along with all of the other guests' dishes withing a very reasonable time in the kitchen. Now, the menu said the alfredo sauce is home made or something, but I don't care where it came from, it was very good. The pasta was cooked just right and the sausage was very complimentary as well. My wife's spaghetti was also cooked just right and the sauce and meatballs were surprisingly good as well. In the first 5 minutes of the meal we looked at each other with a mutual expression of,"Damn, why haven't we been coming here all this time?". Better later than never I suppose.  The staff was great. When the door is opened for you as you walk up to the restaurant, they are earning cool points right out of the gates. Our waitress was definitely a cut above what I have experienced in other restaurants. She indeed did remember the order I was worried about previously, never let my tea or my company's drinks get below half full, was deeply knowledgeable of the menu, and was more than happy to adjust the orders to our preferences. She was simply pleasant to have and let us do what we came to do, eat our meals and have a nice conversation among ourselves.  If the Twisted Italian has been one of those places you have walked by and never really paid attention to like I had been, go for it. I can't do 5 stars because it didn't blow me away so this is one of the most solid 4 star ratings I can give. We will definitely be going back. There was a lot more on the menu that I want explore.

If you were to do some sort of criminal mapping of my eating habits you could probably figure out via some simple deduction where I work. This is mostly due to eating at places around where I conduct business. And when I find a good place to eat, a truly consistent experience, I go there a lot. This is one such place.  Don't be afraid. The lack of windows and barely there front door are a little intimidating at first but keep pushing through that fear. Once inside, don't let the mixed combination of collapsible Lifetime chairs with the wood chairs your grandparents used to own intimidate you. Also, the air conditioner on the wall's drain tube has always been routed down the wall down to well, I don't know where. Also, I hope you like Spanish soap operas because if you go for lunch that is the only thing you are about to watch on the circa 1990's rear projection television in the corner. Pleasantries aside, let's get to the food.   As you have probably already deduced, this is Mexican food. And good Mexican food at that. You can choose from several different offerings such as your standard tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. There are many other offerings such as tacos de Pastor and gorditas as well but I will concentrate on my favorites; tacos, burritos, and quesadilla. I am a basic man that likes to try everything on the menu once and the stick with what really grabs me. The real basic here is that the carne asada is brilliant and the chicken is not far behind. The carne asada is chipped small, spiced perfectly, and has just a little bit of grease left on it. The chicken is a little charred from the grill, also perfectly spiced, and I am pretty sure picks up a little of the carne asada's grease. This isn't a bad thing. Just pick one of these two proteins and the rest takes care of it self. In tacos they are accompanied by wonderful cilantro, pico de gallo, and creamy crumbled cheese. In the burrito you can choose from beans, rice, the same pico de gallo, or whatever normal filler you are used to such as sour cream or guacamole. I always get a mini or full size quesadilla in addition to the tacos or burrito because they are wonderfully cooked and immensely savory. The flavor is not like anything that I really can compare it too. They are unique. No real wetness that you get from some places where it drips out the bottom of the tortilla. Not here. It's always hot and it's always good. Consistency is really the last word at Taco Sahuaro.  I wouldn't be painting the full picture if I didn't mention the rest of the experience. Sit down where you like after ordering food and soon you will be served a bowl of limes, radishes, pickled carrots, and what I can only deduce is some sort of sustained lava compound to be applied to your taco, burrito, whatnot when it arrives. I tasted the lava compound once. Once. You will also get two squeeze bottles for green and red sauce each of which is tasty and a little warmer than I typically like. Used sparingly, I find it a good accompaniment to the main dish. You can also get those wonderful, sugary authentic Mexican Cokes that are becoming more and more ubiquitous around town. The staff is as friendly as they can be while running around making sure everyone gets their food hot and fresh.  All in all, I would recommend Taco Sahuaro. I have been here quite a bit and that is because when no one can decide on where to go, the easy choice is Taco Sahuaro because it is a known quantity. It is going to be hot, fresh, and delicious. It has never failed on this task so it will be in the rotation for a long time to come.

To quote a very wise man,"Mmmm, this is a tasty burger!". Thank you all my fellow Yelpers for not letting me down on this one, again. With a little bit of patience, you too can get a wonderful experience at Two Hippies Gnarly Burger Joint because this isn't a fast food place. It also isn't slow food. It's just right. Just right for everything.  Yet again, we passed this place probably a dozen times before venturing into the plaza which it resides. It was our planned destination this time because each of those dozen times someone inevitably muttered,"We really should try that place sometime". Well, that sometime was now. Then. The other day. Anyway, we went. It isn't really visible from Thomas but you will see the sign as long as you know the cross streets. Not a lot of parking out front but just enough in the lot to the west. I would recommend going around 1100 because anytime after that and we have hit a line to the door pretty quickly. This place isn't a secret which is a double edge sword.  When you do get to the front of the line, grab a chicken sandwich and onion rings. It's not that the burgers and fries are bad, it is that their chicken sandwiches and onion rings are that good. I really mean it. A chicken sandwich made in that time with that flavor is very suspect. But I don't care because that with the onion rings makes you forget about time which is good. The menu otherwise is pretty varied. Many sauces of which I have tried and enjoy, different unique drinks, and customization of all the in between. It would take a while to mathematically get them all, but I like a challenge.  Ahhh, sweet communal feasting. And at a reasonable price. I believe I pay about $8 each trip for a sandwich of some sort & a side. I typically just get water as I don't have as much time during the day to hydrate but really it is just as well as not to detract from the wonderful food. I like finding new places like this. But Two Hippies goes as far as to make me jealous of the neighbors. Those lucky folks in the surrounding area who can walk to this awesome place on a lazy Sunday and really explore the menu. Give it the time it deserves to find those perfect combinations of meats, spreads, and fixings. Paint me green.

Call Brittany Spears, because I did it again. I went to the chain chicken joint and guess what, they don't make very good chicken. I justified it with the "on the way home" rationale backed up by the "they aren't a major chain" basis. Yeah, they may not be McDonald's but they sure suck like McDonald's.   It really isn't too hard to make chicken and I almost dare say hard to screw it up. El Pollo Loco likes to beat those odds apparently. Think thin chicken breasts a little overcooked with loose skin. I guess it beats the alternative of under cooked chicken which would result in an awesome vacation to my lavatory. El Pollo Loco has some pretty good spices to work with and even better equipment by the looks of it. When you walk in you are instantly welcomed by some pretty sweet aromas. Presumably that is where they get you around the outside, the smells. Give your order and take it seat, though. It's going to be a bumpy ride.  The restaurant was fairly empty so I don't know why it took so long to get our food. Blame it on the drive through I suppose. Again, the smells are nice when they arrive but the chicken just falls apart after that. In some cases, this is literal. Rubbery skin, mushy chicken, and the flavors just kind of slop around in that mess. The biscuits are dry and pretty flavorless making the highlight a well mixed fountain drink. Yeah, it was pretty bleak.  Never again I say. I drive past this location very often since it is in my vicinity but I don't even look at it anymore. I feel like it is mocking me because it led me astray. It was the temptation that reminded me of why don't do the chain thing if at all possible. I would have rather been disappointed by Chick-fil-A. At least then I would have had some good chicken out of the deal.

I have to add an extra star. It would be pretty silly for me to keep returning over and over to what I referred to as "mediocre staples". I am comfortable with it, though. I have since tweaked what I order to come with white rice which is rather good and now that they give you a fortune cookie with the check instead of the almond cookie, I am now walking away much happier. I can finally recommend this great little restaurant.

I typically don't eat hamburgers when I go out to eat. I can make burgers at home, after all. And I make a pretty mean burger mind you. I like to just throw on whatever I am in the mood for at home. Avacado, spinach, egg roll, sesame roll, hot mustard, and don't get me started on all of the wonderful cheeses! Sorry, I got excited there for a moment.   Let me get back to Smashburger. I bring up the customization because I can do that at Smashburger. It is nice to look up and just mix and match beyond mustard and ketchup. I have mixed and matched with everything. I have even tried Frank's Red Hot  with goat cheese. Let's just say some things are better than others but at least I have the choice. But if you get just a plain All American burger, then you are still in for a treat. Juicy, hot, and just overall sumptuous. It sounds redundant to say this, but this is a great place to get a burger.  Beyond the good burgers they make a pretty good hot dog. My daughter eats them when we go there about half of the time. I am glad that she can't finish them most of t he time because Daddy doesn't believe in wasting food if you know what I mean. Make sure you grab a basket of fries as well, they are pretty darn good as well. I personally like to throw on some chili and cheese. If you are going to eat out you might as well go all the way! I haven't had a chicken sandwich here yet but my wife has eaten the black bean burger several times and likes it with some Smash Sauce. She throws on some odd sides but when you aren't eating meat, you have to get creative.  I always like to put in something about the establishment and its staff. They are pretty  good to go. They can't help the fact that the line is out the door most days but they do a really good job of keeping the speed up so that the line is moving well. The facilities have been very clean each visit and I can only imagine that isn't an easy feat considering the traffic that must go through there each day. Everybody I have interacted with is very nice. They move quickly so you really can't get a word in to often. Understandable. My biggest gripe has nothing to do with the local staff and that is price. It isn't cheap but I guess it is a somewhat higher level burger joint. I could go to the McDonald's across the street if I wanted lower prices. I could also eat asphalt on a bun. I wouldn't do either.  My wife just reminded me to mention the fried pickles. Yeah, she eats the weird stuff.

This is how you do entertainment. Um, let me modify that for clarity, this is how you do entertainment for several target audiences. Young, old, sports fans, bowlers, gamers, and the list goes on. I live much closer to this awesome venue now and as long as they keep doing things right, I should be a regular for some time to come.  The first time I visited Uptown Alley was when a friend of mine's band was playing there. Yes, I said they had a live band. When I heard he was playing at a bowling alley, my suspicions of his talents were in question. This was my first time to see him play, mind you. Low and behold, my buddy drummed like a mad man and sang like a boss! Which brings me to my point, this was much more than just a bowling alley. It is a rather sprawling multi-purpose facility. Restaurant, arcade, laser tag, bar, sports lounge, and of course bowling. It's a pretty massive place. I had a couple beers, listened to the music, and called it a night. Very good first impression.  My most recent trip was with family to go bowling. We walked right up, grabbed some shoes, and I was chucking gutter balls before you could say "SSSTTTTEEEEEERIKE!" (best said in Al Bundy tone). We ordered a plate of bacon cheese fries while we played a lazy game of pins from a very attentive and pleasant waitress. The bacon cheese fries were pretty good. They sat like a bowling ball in my guts but bowling was never cultured as a San Franciscan vegan sport anyway. I also never saw the bottom of my glass which is always good. Fear not, it was only tea. After a couple games of bowling around the corner to the arcade and some games of air hockey we went. Nobody was injured, so I call that a win.  I would like to emphasize the staff here. I have never had an unpleasant interaction with any of them. It's not like I specifically interviewed anyone and asked about their hopes and dreams but I think you know what I mean. They were knowledgeable, efficient, and best of all friendly. You absolutely need that at an establishment like this. It just makes wrangling the kids together easier knowing you are going to a place where the only attitude you will get is when your kid bowls a better game than you. It's also handy when bellying up to the bar and bartender gives you a smile. It just brings a place like this up a notch from an already solid entertainment model.  This place is great. It's clean, has a warm feeling, and is inviting as soon as you go through the front doors. The layout is logical and easy to navigate. Long rounded walkways make it fun just to travel around the different areas of Uptown Alley whether you are going to the bar for a beer or to the restaurant to rejoin your party. Even the walls are infused with decorative glass or at the very least have paintings to keep the flow going. There are private lanes and rooms for the more mature patrons giving the option of getting a little more intimate with your friends and/or significant others. So the next free night you have with some buds or the family, head on down with a couple dollars and an some energy for fun because this place is sure to have something up your alley.   I sort of feel bad for that last line, but I am going to leave it in anyway.

I was a little surprised when my wife said she wanted to dine at Gyros Town. Not because she isn't a culinary adventurer necessarily, but because I didn't know she was interested in Greek food at all. Her reasoning was, " We have been pretty lucky with trying new places and foods, let's try there." Alright then.  I am really glad I married my wife. She is smarter than me and it comes in handy like when trying new restaurants such as this one. It is a rather cozy little restaurant with booths on the sides and tables in the middle. We are a booth family and these were definitely booth family approved. There is a television, a drinks cooler, and a counter to order otherwise. Very simple, very effective.  My wife and I ordered a number one which is just a basic gyro with fries and a drink. I like to try the basic stuff at restaurants I am not familiar with so that I can get an idea of how they cook what should be their simple recipes. What we received was a very tasty gyro. The meat might have been a little salty but I really don't have a basis for comparison in this food genre. There was also a tasty sauce inside the pita bread that complimented the meat. If I knew the name of it I would say it, so for those of you who I just offended with my lack of gyro knowledge, I apologize. The side of fries was an afterthought but I don't want to short change them because they were pretty good. It was a good portion of food in the basket. It was just enough to top me off.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I received the impression that each customer was special to them. That each person in the restaurant was an opportunity. That sounds horribly cliche but I really mean it. The young lady who took the orders walked around and cleaned the tables as the patrons left and politely asked others if they were enjoying their meals. A little later another gentleman who I identified as one of the chefs came out to see how the food tasted. I responded with an honest,"I am really enjoying it". It feels like a start up even though it has been around a little while. I will be going back to support the fact I am thankful there are little shops like this that remind me that I need to try new things.

Pizza has returned to Vistancia! And it couldn't have come sooner in my opinion. I missed the pizza place that previously occupied this space (R.I.P Grande) if only for the option to have pizza and wings close by. What's better is I read some chatter online that said this was to be a sister location to the venue at 59th Avenue and the 101. I had been there before and was very happy with my trip. Things were looking up.  Immediately coming through the door the feel is very different considering what was in this exact location not too long ago. It was warm, inviting, and very pizza joint. You walk up to the counter with the menu hanging up behind it and just start reading left to right. The first thing that I noticed was the variety. Stevie's has sandwiches, wings, calzones, pizza, a list of other things, and something they simply call "Rolls". These rolls are really intriguing in their simplicity. It appears to be a sort of cannoli made of dough, cheese, and your choice of fillers such as broccoli, sausage, pepperoni, and a couple of other choices. There are a couple of televisions which not surprisingly had sports playing as well. It was a really good feel. The place being very busy in the first week of their opening had a good vibe as well.  My family went with a sausage, mushroom pizza, 10 barbecue wings, 10 mild wings, and an order of garlic knots. With as busy as it was, the food came pretty quick. It came to the table hot and smelling great. The wings were really good. I take my wings a little crispy and these were a little shy of that, but pretty good. The flavor was pretty spot on albeit a little warm for mild. The barbecue was just my style. A little tangy and full of flavor. The garlic knots were buttery and loaded with garlic. Not to much for this guy, but some might not appreciate that much. Then there was the pizza. This is touted as New York Style Pizza so I will let you decide. It is a thinner slice with smaller more numerous pieces of toppings which were mushroom and sausage in my case. The mushrooms were fresh and the sausage had good flavor. What it didn't have was excessive grease and a fold-able flex. It was baked pretty crispy and kept a good shape while I ate it. I know some like a nice greased up fold-able slice like Grande used to serve. I respect that, but I prefer this style. It was a darn good pie and we all enjoyed it.  Here is the other cent of the two I've got. Ranch. Some call it a sin to dip one's pizza or wings in ranch. I am an occasional dipper. A social dipper. I am not addicted, I swear. I can stop any time I want. Stevie's ranch is a little too much on the buttermilk side and comes in the small cups. I am a big fan of the thicker less oily ranch in the big cups (Barro's is my benchmark on this subject). If you are a purist, disregard my insolence. I know not what I say.   I have to admit, I was mentally comparing Stevie's to the pizza shop that was in this location before. I couldn't resist it. You walk into the same space and your mind can't help but want to see something it had previously. That was a very good thing in this case. The service is so much better, the ambiance is much more welcoming, the prices are super reasonable, and the refills are free! I am very glad that another pizza joint took up the spot of the old. It is just the thing Vistancia needed in my opinion. My gripes are small but my smile is big. Welcome to Vistancia, Stevie's!

I am old enough to know the benefits of a sure thing. In my earlier years I was okay with taking a chance more often but now, in my early thirties, I find that having a known quantity in life is very valuable. Jimmy John's is that known quantity. If I am ever on the fence, not sure what I want, low on time, I can go to this place and KNOW that I am going to get a good sandwich, at a good price, and made very quickly. I really like knowing these things in life.  Thankfully JJ's came through and took over this ex-Quiznos location. I was never a fan of Quiznos and apparently the rest of the area seemed to agree because they obviously didn't make it. The location is pretty easy to get to residing on the Northwest corner of a fairly busy intersection. It if off downtown a bit but that works out for me considering where I work. Lots of windows in the place makes for wonderful natural lighting in a standard Jimmy John's decor. Inviting I would say.  The sandwiches are good. I have never had a bad sandwich here, just a bad combination, and that is my fault. I like to try different combinations and every once in a while I have to find out on my own I don't like certain mixtures. If I ever come in for the previously mentioned "sure thing", I am going with the Italian Night Club. Salami, capicola, ham, provolone, and all the fixins with lettuce, tomato, onion, ma... You get the gist of it. Fresh ingredients with really good bread. Once you find your combo, I am certain you will be happy with the integrity of the individual ingredients.  Now, this place isn't akin to the artisan offerings in the area. I get that. I know of several different places that serve very delicious food just around the corner. But they aren't as fast or of the same value. I am talking about the consistency here. We once tried the BBQ place across the parking lot (20 paces) from this JJ's and it wasn't that good. I feel for a place that can't cut it in such a good location but that is what business is all about I think. Consequently, they are no longer in that shop. There is a place called So We Meat Again down the road as well. It's a great sandwich but the speed and price aren't the same. I still go there, but not as often. I simply value things differently in different situations I suppose.
