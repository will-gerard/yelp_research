I have been a patient at Fuhr Chiropractic for 7 years and it has truly change my life. Doctor Petermann is an educated, genuine, and honest doctor whose practice far exceeds any other office I've attended. The staff is friendly and personable. And throughout the years, I only feel better after seeing Doctor Eric. Thanks Doc!

I experienced awful customer service, inexcusable wait times for my Togo order, and an unapologetic hostess and staff.   After placing an order on the phone, I was quoted 25-35 minutes for my order, which included 4 rolls and 1 garlic edamame. I arrived 40 minutes later and was quoted another 10 minutes until my food was ready. I was given my edamame right away but it was cold. No apologies for the late food or cold appetizer.   A manager then quoted us another 5 minutes, which then became 10. Again, a small apology was made but no efforts to rectify the situation.   I asked for a new order of edamame because ours was cold, after asking several times, the manager (Rebecca) agreed.   In the meantime our food was no where to be found. We eventually got our food an hour and 15 minutes AFTER I placed my order over the phone.   I requested that part of the bill be taken care of and after negotiating back and forth (and the manager claiming she had no power) she finally agreed. She took off the 2 appetizers, eel sauce, and the fresh wasabi. Nothing in comparison to the rude service and late food.   On top of all this the hostess was rude, said the F word to a customer on the phone, and never apologized for the wait. They did offer us free water several times, so I'll give them that.   Mediocre sushi for way to high a price. Not worth the time.  Side note: it was a Sunday evening around 8:45pm and the restaurant was hardly busy.

I love China Jade!   I usually order the sweet and sour chicken with lo mein or rice. My husband orders the  chicken fried rice every single time and he loves it.   Today I switched  it up and ordered the rice noodles with chicken, with a side of sweet and sour sauce. Very Tasty!  The delivery is FAST and online ordering is a breeze.
