I bought my fiance her engagement ring here.  The sales person Brittany was fantastic in helping me assess what size and style.  In the end I came up with a customized design, and they built me a wax model of what it might look like.  My fiance LOVES the ring, and she constantly gets compliments on it.  I highly recommend this store. Their pricing was awesome and their customer service was superb.

I don't wear suits often, so I totally appreciated their advise on what will make me look my best.  Extremely professional, and they really know their stuff.  After they showed me the tailoring that needed to be done, I could really see how a good suit is supposed to look.  This place rocks.  If I had to do it all over again, I would visit the Tailor BEFORE even going out to buy a suit.  He helps you know what to look for in a suit.

Despite the 'interesting' aroma,  Lee Lees is my favorite exotic grocery store.  They also have a very FINE selection of imported beer and sake.  I still haven't figured out how to approach the meat counter, as it's very intimidating.  The prices are great, and you'll find bizarre fruit and veges.  -dave

After reading the reviews here, we decided to check out Cyclo since it's right down the road.  I can't believe we never went there before, it was REALLY good.  The food was spectacular, and the service was great.  It was affordable, and the owner wasn't quite as wild as we read.  She was energetic, but not overbearing.  We got there a little early, which was good because it got really busy later.    SPECIAL NOTE:  It's one of those rare places where you can bring a bottle of wine, or some beers if you want to.  There is probably some fee for it, but it would have made our date perfect.  We had the garlic green beans (I would have NEVER thought of eating a full plate of green beans could be so scrumptious) , the curry/pineapple chicken (yummy and not too sweet, and finely tuned), and the Bun Sai Gon (Saigon Rice Vermicelli)...  all were A+ dishes and had very intricate flavor combinations.  We had three dishes and the bill was about $25 after a healthy  tip.

One of my favorite places to go for a nice meal and a beer.  I usually order their Chicken Salad and Jeremiah Red beer.  After a couple beers, the restaurant is within stumbling distance of the Chandler 24 Movie theater.

I think the owners were nice, but when not supervised, the staff was rude, and only interested in talking with friends instead of helping the customer. I don't expect much when it comes to game stores, much like the service at a Chinese restaurant it usually stinks...  But these guys were jerks, and unwilling to assist or even move from their fixed location.    We left the store saying we would never go back.  Their D&D miniature selection is good, so I hope they get better service some day.

I know my friends like this place.  But to me the service was lazy and veryy slow. Gnats flying all around, and the soda was flat.  The waitress said it wasn't.  No paper towels in the bathroom.

From a band's perspective:  One of the best venues in town for large scale concerts.    If you are gunna pull over 1000 and under 3000 this is an excellent venue.  The sound is IMHO the very best in town, and the lights are superb too.  Be sure to tip  your sound and lighting guy, before sound check.  Stage monitors are rockin, FOH is slammin.  Venue satisfies band rider.  The staff was very accommodating, and professional.  The stage is at least six feet away from the audience, which was a little strange because we like to get right up next to our fans, but that was a small price to pay for such an awesome venue.  One quirk with this venue is that doors typically open around 6 or 7pm, which is very early for most working folks.  Ticket prices are also a little bit more, but if you're seeing a band there, they are most likely a national act and worth it.  -dave  The Strand - Arizona Industrial Music http://www.strandland.com

Can't say I've ever had a great experience here, but they have a good selection and fair pricing so I put up with their crappy service and the occasional returned item.

Lees Sandwiches is one of my favorite places for lunch.   If you try it, be sure to get the BBQ Pork sandwich, and not one of the American sandwiches on the right hand side of the menu.   It's super cheap, fills you up, and is the strangest most wonderful flavor combination.  It's a huge baguette with pickled veges and meat, which tastes waay better than it sounds.  I think my brother said it's French-Vietnamese cuisine, which is a really interesting combo.   Also their spring rolls are light and awesome.  They also have a bunch of bizarre shakes, which are fun to try.  The  Avacado Shake is particularly good.

From a band's perspective:  Chasers is an excellent medium sized venue.  Reasonable rental fee, if you're nice to the owner.  Great sound system if you have the right sound guy.  Enough low end to get the job done, and decent enough monitors.   Standard lighting.  A few par cans with a good selection of colors.  All ages, Bar W/ID.  I think the capacity is around 400 realistically.  You'll need at least 100 to make the place look happening.  Our band has played Chasers at least 5 times, and every show was a lot of fun, and relatively painless.  -dave strand  The Strand - Arizona Industrial Music http://www.strandland.com

Great food great service great price.   If you want big portion Mexican food this place is choice. Family run, local.  It gets a little loud sometimes, but we got a seat in the back. Our waitress Tandra was exemplary.

By far, the best dentist office I've been to.  Dr Brent is calm, collected, and skilled at the art of dentistry.  His office runs smoothly, and efficiently.  The Dr is very good at communicating what he is doing, and is very good at making you feel at ease.  This is a great office. A+

I knew i needed a nice suit for my wedding, so after seeing the reviews on yelp my fianc√© and I went to see Barry at Men's Apparel.  We couldn't be happier with the service, honesty, and professionalism.  I got a sharp suit, and Barry helped without being overbearing, He was very good about showing us different options, while making suggestions and steering us in the right direction.  His stories were great too. We spent under $250 which was awesome for the suit I got!

I didn't really have time to research much before taking our 2 year old to Urgent Care for a problem with her arm/wrist she got while playing.  It was after hours on a weekend, so we were happy to find an urgent care relatively close to our house that was open. The experience was great!  The staff was friendly and accommodating and we were IN so fast!   The nurse practitioner was very kind, professional, and knowledgable.  She was very careful and calm and our daughter didn't even cry like she usually does at the doctors office.  Then, as a courtesy they called us the next day to check and see how she was doing.  I would definitely return.

Chodang is right down the street from our house, I have no idea why I've never seen the place.  At first glance it looks like it might not be open, I think the sunlight hits the windows so you can't see the OPEN sign.  At any rate it was an amazing find.  The staff was really pleasant and prompt.  The food was great.  We had the Sea-food soup (with an egg)  and the Bulgoki and both were supreme.  They serve everything with a bunch of side dishes, most of which I've never had before.  Their Kimchi was also excellent and I really enjoyed the flat seaweed wafer thingies, basically all the sides were tasty, tho a couple were too spicy for me to handle.  It's not one of those Korean restaurants where you get to grill your own food, but for me that's okay too since I also like to sit back and relax sometimes instead of be grill-master.  Also I wouldn't consider myself to be an expert on Korean cuisine, though I've been to a handful of other establishments.   Still, this one was very enjoyable, affordable, and had a good vibe.  We definitely have plans to walk there sometime (when it's not sweltering hot) and get our drink on with their collection of Soju.  (Kinda like Korea's version of Sake but sweeter)

For my girlfriend's birthday I took her to Mary Elaine's, which is a super fancy French restaraunt in Scottsdale, AZ. My brother has worked there for a few years now, and he's been suggesting that we experience it. The staff was extremely attentive and pleasant, addressing us by name and taking a moment to replace my girlfriend's blue napkin with a black one to match her dress. They even brought over a small stool for me to set my digital camera on. The restaraunt is situated on the top floor of the Phoenician Resort and every seat at Mary Elaine's has a spectacular view of the valley.  We let the chef prepare a tasting menu for us, and their Sommelier (wine expert) paired wines with many of the tastings. I will have to consult with my brother to fully explain the dishes served, but the food was so fine tuned to perfection that I can not imagine improvement. I HIGHLY recommend EVERYONE eat at Mary Elaine's at least once, as it is truly the finest experience in dining I can imagine.  I posted images of our food here.  http://www.secret.strandland.com/MaryElaines/

Yeah the food here was excellent.   Extremely packed with fresh spices and complex flavors.  Easily the best Thai food I've had. We had the Curry Puffs, Red Chicken curry (2 of 5 heat was still nice and spicy) and the Pad Thai (chicken).  All were excellent.

Tad is a great guy and not afraid to take chances with hair.  Jason was also a great help with a nice scalp massage.  You can tell they are all having a  good time, and excelling at their craft.

I play music in a band, and when it's time for a gig, I swing by Sabel for a hair cut.  She is an artist, meticulous, and does amazing things with a razor.  I always leave with my hair looking cool.

Here's a great, affordable place to eat.   The food is VERY good, very fresh and great presentation.  The staff takes pride in their establishment, it's clean and pretty chic looking.  The music was even 'chic', minimal jazzy European techno.  To top it off, I had the best turkey sandwich I've ever had there.  It was the Monte Carlo.  As best as I can tell it was quality turkey, lettuce, tomato, balsamic vinaigrette, bacon, a little mayo,and some kind of nuts on some very good bread.    My girlfriend had the Portabella Delight, which was Portabella mushrooms covered with Hummus and Feta Cheese, with some nicely sauteed veges on the side.  Little pieces of toasted bread  on the side drizzled with Olive Oil...  She said, "It was perfect!"  For the two of us, we both had satisfying portions with coffee and iced tea and it was just 21 bucks.   I will definitely go back to Pastis.

Wow, very good barbecue and the best Cole-Slaw I've ever had.  Hopefully you don't get turned off by the religious message of the day that might be on the white-board, and stay focused on trying out their food.  It was purely by chance that we stumbled into this joint, and it's totally not near my house... but if you are in the area, you should try this place out!

We had a really nice dinner here.  The staff was super friendly, the food was excellent and the prices were reasonable.  Our food came out quickly, and the restaurant was clean.  The staff answered our questions and were courteous. We had the Vege Curry, and the Curry with Okra.  We also tried a very cool looking triangular dosai.  It was our first time trying dosai and I think it was the best meal of the night, though the others were quite yummy.

Dawn til Dusk responded in a very timely manner, and was able to send someone to my location within the hour.  Once here, the tech was informative and prices were reasonable.  When the tech left my air is back to operating at peak efficiency.  Great job!

My brother said to check out this place and he was right.  Great food prepared beautifully.  My meal was huge and when i got the bill it was only ten bucks!  Very gracious and pleasant service. I'm definitely coming back here with my fiance . I ordered the spicy sashimi salad and added some scallops to it .

For our delivery they said 35 minutes, which turned into 103 minutes before we got our food. The owner was apologetic, and recooked and delivered our order.   He said they have a new delivery person who got lost.    Thankfully the food tasted good.  So they regained a star with that.  I am not sure if we will try this location again after the long wait...  even though the food was pretty tasty.

Great service, great price!  They fixed up our sprinklers, professional attitude, did a thorough job, were friendly, and offered us a super deal on a sprinkler timer that they had left over from a previous upgrade.  They were more interested in doing a great job and less interested in making a quick buck.

I took TKD when I was a teenager in Chicago and it was a huge confidence booster, and got me healthy, social, and respectful.  Plus I got to learn COOL kicks, like in the movies. For the last couple years I got back into TKD and the Nguyen brothers were more than I could ever ask for in a TKD instructor. Training with the Nguyen Brothers was like training with two Bruce Lees.  They are at the top of their game,  I mean EXTREMELY talented,  have a fun and challenging regiment, and help each and every student to improve all aspects of martial arts and in life.  I was fortunate to train with them, and am so happy that they have a school of their own now.   I highly recommend NB Tae Kwon Do for any age.  Thank you sirs for everything!
