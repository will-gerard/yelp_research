I think I have found my new favorite Mexican food establishment. And it's close to my home. And it has good tequila. And the food is SPICY. And it's delicious.  When I have to do a shot of 1800 to kill the burn from the salsa, it is my kind of place! And the so papillary with everything are phenomenal.  I am hooked.  That is all.

No. No. No. Do not waste your time or money on this place. Terrible service for an empty establishment and even worse drinks. I ordered Patron and got bar tequila. Like I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Go next door to Kona grill.
