I was disappointed when our check in time was for 11:30am and we didn't even get in until almost 12:30pm.  Then not only did we wait an hour to get in, there is long lines everywhere.  We waited at least an hour to do a 5-6 minute 3D game and then the lines were too long to do the other training so we just went on to the 3D movie and then that pushed us right into the 4D movie.  So we were there from 11:30am - 2:30pm and did 3 (5-10 minutes each) things.  Very disappointed.  A small churro was $5 so even to feed my kids a small snack would have been $25.  Very interesting idea and we would have enjoyed it more but my kids actually had more fun at Peter Piper Pizza after the Marvel Experience.  That's all they have talked about was playing games.  Never mentioned the Marvel Experience once to their friends.  They were not prepared for such a large number of people.  I figured having a check in time would help eliminate the crowd but it was a waste of our time.

We recently used Carpets of Arizona to repair our blinds and install our new carpet.  They came out quickly and did an amazing job.  Jerry was the representative that assisted us, and he was professional.  Prices were great!
