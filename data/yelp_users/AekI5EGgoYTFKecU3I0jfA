This airport is getting much better! Many, many choices (Einsteins, Joe's on the way, Cinnabon, Starbucks...) as far as where to grab a quick bite. Lots of places to charge your phone while you wait. Overall my experience with staff has been friendly (other than missing a flight on Mothers Day because of the ridiculous TSA line). And the filtered water at the drinking fountains is a huge perk in my book as well!

My last review still stands, but a recent trip with our two pups bumped this place up to five star fame. I was super impressed that PHX is not only dog friendly (you can have your dog out of its crate), but they also accommodate them nicely with a few pet relief areas. The one we used was called "Bark Park." It's fenced, it has lots of room, and places to get the pups water. Would highly recommend this airport to anyone with pets!

This Del Taco isn't in the best place of town. It's also connected to a Circle K. As I pulled up there were various people on the sidewalk, just sitting (keep in mind it's 100 degrees)... a little odd, but to each his own.  Drive in window is locked down, so they had to unlock it to give me my food, and then promptly relocked it as I was pulling away. Interesting... Overall the food was eatable. Especailly considering it was Taco Tuesday so $1.09 for three! Score. If there was another del taco within the area, I would happily never come back to this location again.

I came looking for a particular pair of Coach glasses that weren't at the San Tan Mall location. They quickly helped me locate the pair, looked up my prescription from another store and handled my insurance. Within two hours I walked out with a new pair of Tiffany & Co. glasses that I love. Sales people aren't pushy. Just limited options, so if you don't want a pricey designer pair go elsewhere.

I'm a big fan of Olive Garden, and this is a pretty standard one. They are all set up the same way, aren't they? Lunch special is cheap if you can get there before 4pm ($7.99 endless soup, salad and breadsticks). The lasagna frita appetizer is so delicious - make sure you try it! And try subbing ranch for their italian salad dressing - it's my new favorite (why don't they sell it at the grocery store too??).

Gross! Just got done eating and we will not be back. My plate had a hair curly hair on it. No, it wasn't on the food, but gross! My bacon was so hard I thought I was going to chip a tooth eating it. My husband's eggs were raw. I understand Denny's is cheap, but that doesn't mean it has to awful.   I will say the service was good.

Loss of star because I really don't like their chicken. I know, gasp! I think it is flavorless and boring. So, why give it 4 stars?? The peppermint milkshakes are heavenly, their waffle fries are tasty and their customer service is out of this world!! I am not sure how they do their hiring, but it is consistently the best service out there!! Well done HR.

I'm not a fan usually of Jack, but I love their peppermint oreo milkshake. We went through the drive thru on Tuesday evening, and the girl working behind the counter had so many facial piercings, her phone was about to fall out of her butt pocket and she had SO much skin showing. She also was not in any type of uniform, as she was wearing American Eagle and pink brand clothes (don't think Jack is paying for that for everyone). To each his own after work hours, but I do not want to see your belly skin as you hand me my food. I had hoped that even though they were fast food that they'd have a professional standard. Not a fan, won't be back.

Standard Petsmart location. We buy our dogs the wellness brand food, and they have a variety in stock here. Lots of treats and toys too. And, most importantly for us right now, a cleaning product section for training new pups! I highly recommended Nature's Miracle brand.  Loss of star because no one has ever gone out of their way to welcome us at this store or ask if we needed help.

I came into this plaza to visit dress barn, but ended up buying more here! I liked the shirts they had here for work. I need to bring my husband back to buy some dress clothes for work too as they looked very inexpensive. If you sign up for their email group you can get 20% off almost every time you shop. Definitely worth the stop!

I recently bought a motorcycle for my husband (best wife ever, right?).  He picked out the place, but I was the one needing to get financed. We put in all the financing information in online and by the next day their helpful finance guy called me and let me know that we had been approved and could pick up the bike that day!! My hubby was on the road with his new bike that afternoon and is happy happy happy! Great, no hassle service!! Would highly recommend for anyone considering a bike!

Not impressed. Just moved and this was the closest place to go. Made an appointment. Was seated on time, but others who came in after me were left waiting for up to 30 minutes after their appointment time! I showed the man a picture of how I wanted my nails, he said ok (3 red, one white and one silver/glitter). I only got red nails. I even told him I was getting them done for my birthday, so he obviously didn't care/understand. Paid $30 for gel mani and they are already chipping less than a week later. I'm the girl who keeps gel nails on for 6 weeks (lol I'm cheap and those suckers usually stay on), but no can do this time! He was so rushed he didn't even put a base coat on. All designs are airbrushed.  Pedicure was cheap - I'd go back for it, thus the 2 stars. Chairs were nice and the massage was short ($17 version), but good. Polish was exactly what I asked for. No hot towels or hot stones. No waters given to clients.  All in all I was highly disappointed with my manicure and will not return in the near future.

Standard starbucks location. Extra plus that they have a drive through, but it is seldom less than 5 cars deep. And always slow!! On a few occasions I have been late to work because of the drive thru line here - oops! I recommend to go inside if at all possible (much faster). And be sure to get the app - I can't believe how many discounts they send me via email now that I'm signed up.

Such a fun tourist spot! I have been twice now and would highly recommend getting the 3 for 1 pass. I think it's like $18 and you get the train, mine tour and mystery shack. The mine tour is the best out of the three though, so if you have to choose just one, do that! Our guide was very informative and you learn something new every time you do it! The train teaches you more about the history of the area, which is also interesting. The mystery shack is a trip! I can see kids really enjoying it, but I enjoyed it as an adult too.  Fun for the whole family, any ages! Would recommend for a fun day activity. Remember there isn't a whole lot out here though, so be sure to plan to eat before/after - the food here is iffy.

Went in today to pick up my ring that needed resized. I had no idea where to go (not from here), so I relied on my fellow yelpers and you didn't let me down!  Dropped my ring off Monday, so one week turn around on average. Price was a little over $200 for my engament ring and wedding band, so not unreasonable.  Overall excellent, prompt customer service. Always greeted by someone upon arrival. Definitely get the sense that these people have been in business for awhile and know what they are doing. Calm, laid back environment, but still very professional. Would highly reccommend for any of your jewelry needs.

Purchased a living social deal to try this place out. I LOVE that they have delicious cheese curds (a must try) & free peanuts & $6 pitchers during happy hour. Their burgers on the other hand were awful. So bad my husband only ate one or two bites...   We will most definitely try it again, but minus the burger next time!

I drove by the farm on my way to work for a year before I finally stopped in to see the place. Its huge! We went for the Pumpkin Festival and there was so much to see! The dog show and pig races were fun. The corn maze was confusing. It was too hot to stay all day, but even as 4 adults we found plenty to do for the fair price of $14!! Food was a little pricey ($3 for a tiny brownie??), but I needed a good excuse for a San Tan Flat burger anyway ;) Signage could be increased for easier navigation. Would highly recommend for locals and visitors alike.

I was very impressed with their lunch menu, which is offered even on the weekends - score! Lots of options under $7, some a little higher (my hubby got the fish tacos). Be sure you grab a coupon out of the Sunday paper, or sometimes in the mail. 15% off the bill, or other good specials are always going. I love their bloomin onion - it's a must try (again and again)! Endless soup and salad on the lunch menu was ok. I thought the potato soup was a little too salty though.  Overall, I'd recommend (especially for lunch with the low prices) and will be back!

It's your typical Applebees in regards to the menu. Basic selection, decent prices, etc. The service however is terrible.  We had what looked to be a small child seat us and he must have asked us three times how are night was before we got to the table. Maybe he was nervous? Then our waiter kneeled down next to our table and told us how he was also a chef a few nights a week here so he "knew everything"... Impressive!  He forgot to grab us napkins when we asked for them. He brought out some of our dishes before others. Not a fan of this location. Next time we're by campus we'll visit a different place.

I'm not a huge fan. The inside is very old, not dirty just run down. The staff isn't overly friendly inside. The drive in is SO slow... If you are looking for mexican cuisine, just go to a sit down place instead of here. You will probably have the same wait time and price, with a better ambiance.

Stopped in for some bowling on a Saturday afternoon. They offer a flat rate for 2 hours with shoes - only $5 for the deal on Sunday (wishing we would have come a day later). The lanes are great - nice big lounge couches behind. They were starting to turn the lights off for the evening bowling while were were there. They had music videos (all from the 80's unfortunately) playing on big screens behind the lanes. Lots of options at their snack shack and big bar area. Would highly recommend!

We had some time to kill after a movie, so we stopped in after seeing a sign for free game play with a movie ticket. They offer 30 minutes of free gaming, all you have to do is show your ticket stub from Harkins - score! We were able to get our fill in that 30 minutes, so I'm not sure how they are making $ on this deal, but we look forward to doing this again. I was kind of confused as to where you would order food. The place isn't laid out well and it seems as if they are short staffed. Would be a great place for a kids party.

Went here today with a gift card. It wouldn't work in the card reader at the drive up spot, so I asked the server to help. I had just got the card so I knew there was money on it. They ended up having the manager come out, but no one could get it to work. They ended up paying for the whole meal, which I really appreciated because I really only dropped by because I had the card. Is this a 5 star resteraunt, no, but the service was outstanding and the food was good for being fast food. I really like their shakes (hoping the do 1/2 off shakes again this summer) & happy hour drinks (especially the strawberry limeade)!

An outstanding game store! The best in the area, so look no further! Great selection of a variety of games, new and old. Friendly staff. Very clean. Most games are $5-10 more than what you'd find online, but i consider that minimal and often buy here anyway for the convenience and satisfaction of getting the game now! It's also pretty awesome to be able to support a FLGS.

Great location. I have never had to wait too long at this location and service has always been great! Make sure you go during never ending pasta bowl or during lunch for soup and salad! Often there are coupons in the paper as well. I enjoy their zuppa tuscana, Alfredo dipping sauce and of course, the breadsticks!!

This a service review. I have a 2013 Elantra, and get it serviced here regularly. I have never had a problem getting in, and have always been treated kindly. Are they the fastest? No, but it's not too bad. There is a free coffee machine and nice chairs to wait around in. Cost is fair - $40/oil change. Would recommend!

My husband and I love teakwoods! They have cheese curds and pitchers of beer, so it's a win win. Loss of star for the burgers. Every time I ask for well and there is always pink in the center. I'm not sure if it's the waitress not telling the cook, or the cook, but I always feel bad either not eating it or sending it back. Overall we will keep going back. Big menu, friendly staff and peanuts!!

Came in here 30 minutes before they closed and they gladly took my car. Service was fast, no pressure with what they offered as ugrades. Kind customer service.   Lost a star for the waiting room. Not somewhere I want to be. Smelled dirty, looked dirty. There was coffee, but no real creamer and tiny Styrofoam cups. All the magazines were car themed. I'm used to Jiffy Lubes with current magazines, tv with sound, free popcorn, etc. This one had none of that. Bummer.  Overall I'd highly recommend for the service, just bring your own entertainment (book, magazine, gameboy haha) & maybe some hand sanitizer.

Stopped in for dinner last night, and we were quickly seated. Standard decor inside/out. We were able to enjoy patio seating which is still warm enough to enjoy in late November with the heaters. Service was outstanding!!   I love their macaroni and cheese ball appetizer, so I get it as a meal. We got a loaded baked potato tot app to share, it was tasty and under $6! All there food is priced a little higher than most, but I think it's still fair. Love the endless bread!! And the strawberry lemonade, despite it being rediculously sweet, is also a must.    Be sure to stop in for lunch - their pizza and salad deals are the best. I do not recommend getting their burgers. They taste burned around the edges (charbroiled I suppose) no matter how you ask for them to be cooked. My husband also doesn't like their new fries.

Paid a little over $200 for my husband, grandmother and myself to go on a dinner cruise. I had heard, from fellow yelpers, that the food was good and the scenery was beautiful, but I was concerned it wouldn't live up to the price. It did!! I was very impressed by the outstanding customer service (always a friendly smile on board to help you with anything), the wonderful scenery, and great food! You get plenty of food (including delicious dessert), so come hungry, however know that dinner isn't served until about an hour after you get going. There is a snack bar however, so we grabbed some popcorn and that helped! Beer/wine for purchase downstairs as well.   I will say that the sight seeing of animals is rare and very distant. Several times they kindly pointed out animals, but even with binoculars I couldn't see anything. I'm not an expert though, so for amateurs like myself just enjoy the other scenery - it's quite enough!  Am excited to take other family and friends along! Fun experience to share with others.

I absolutely LOVE the chicken caesar salad here!! It is HUGE for under $10 - cannot be beat! I liked the seating at this location. We went on a Friday night and didn't have to wait long to be seated. We sat in the little "house" in the back, beyond the patio - very cutesy! Good service.  My only issue with this place is I really don't think I like anything else on the menu... Maybe I'm just a picky eater, but there's not too much variety.

Went here for the first time to try something new... bad idea. Expensive, lack luster burgers. Their menu here on yelp does not pair up with what they actually offer either. We went through the drive through at about 830pm on a Saturday and they forgot to give us our wings. Didn't notice until we got home :-(   Would not recommend.

Went for the first time this evening. Cute place with a nice, clean cozy atmosphere. Friendly staff, but not overly helpful. The cheesy garlic bread was incredible - YUMM! My only complaint is the actual pizza. We got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard. The pizza sauce is also way too sweet. It tasted more like a dessert some bites. They put so much sauce on the pizza that you can't get around tasting the sweetness (underneath and on top of the actual toppings). Too sweet for me, but maybe you're into that? Decent price ($30 for three, all got sodas, medium pizza and app to share).  Overall I wouldn't go again, but would recommend to someone who likes sweet saucy pizza.

Great location. Many theatres. Always has a variety of  show times to fit any schedule. Love that Harkins offers a discount program with the cup and tshirt! Keeps me coming back without killing my budget. One downfall to this location is that they constantly check your ticket. When you walk in, when you walk down the hall, at the door of your theatre. They must have a serious problem with people not paying.

I went in today wanting to upgrade my cable and internet. I'm not a fan of doing those things online because I had questions. The lady greeted me with a smile and quickly took me back to the desk to set everything up. Within 10 minutes I was out the door with everything I needed to set cable up in two rooms. Painless, efficient, would highly recommend!

This Lenny's is VERY small when they don't have the extra side open. The three of us had to sit at the counter, which really prevents any conversation from happening... The service was quick and friendly. Burgers are OK. I got the grilled cheese this time, and it was good. I really like the fries, but they give you way too many. Think I'll share one with my hubby next time and save a few bucks. They do have styrofoam cups which is nice in the heat, and the decor inside is 50's diner cutesy. Overall, I wouldn't go back. There's just better, cheaper places out there for a basic burger.

This place is SO cheap - so if you're looking for inexpensive, go here!  I think it was $42 for a mani w/ gel and pedi.  My friend and I were blown away at the cost, which tempts us to return... but we wont'.  We didn't make an appointment, but they were eager to get us into a chair.  We sat with our feet in the water for a good 20 minutes before anyone was available to start with us. Not too big of a deal, but by then the water was cold and their massage chairs are NOT good. Very old...   I don't like the gel/shellac polish they use. It chipped and didn't look good after about a week/week and a half (typically I can wear mine for 3-4 weeks without a chip).  My friend's color was completely see through. Our toes both turned out OK, but again they chipped completely off some of my toes by the end of week 2. I think their product is outdated - they need to upgrade!  Overall, if you need a cheap mani/pedi and don't need it to last more than a week - go here.

Save your money, do not go here. $45 for three and we were hungry when we left (remember this is a buffet). The absolute worst buffet I've been to. Dirty, messy, unpleasantly smelly... we drove over 20 minutes to try it after all the commercials. Yes, they have a chocolate fountain. One that small children continually stick their fingers into. Mashed potatoes were soupy. Very limited meat selection. Server was very awkward, kept asking us "are you guys good?"  One star for having delicious yeast rolls and honey butter. Would not recommend. Will not come again.

Beautiful park! There's a long walking path along the lake. There are rentals you can grab to cruise the lake (kayaks, small boats, paddle boards, etc). There's a splash pad for the kiddos (opens May 2 2015). Lots to do and see and also nice benches to just hang out and relax. Always nice to see water in the desert!!

Came in yesterday for lunch. It was pretty busy, but the customer service was outstanding! I've been to a bears out in QC and this one has the same feel. Lots of doggy pictures on the wall and peanuts on the floor. I ordered a grilled cheese - very tasty! For $10 it came with soup and salad too! Filling!   The chips and queso and beer would make a great happy hour stop as well. Will be back!

We take our two small dogs here and love it. Dr. Oliver takes the time to explain everything clearly that we always leave learning something new! So often you go to other vets and they make you feel rushed to get out the door. Not here. They take the time to let your dogs warm up to them and are very patient. Would highly recommend!!

Coming from California I'm so glad there is Golden Spoon here in AZ too! I thought when the one in Gilbert closed, they were gone, but here one is!! I LOVE Golden Spoon more than any other froyo joint around. I keep it simple - chocolate and vanilla swirl with cookie dough bites. The best. Coupon in the entertainment book for BOGO!

The service at this location is excellent! We live really close, and the staff always greets us with  a smile. My only complaint is the prices. I can save so much more money by shopping at Winco or Walmart. However, the convenience of the location, and the quick service keep me coming back every now and then.

This location consistently has the LONGEST lines of all time. One night my husband and I stopped in just for a carmel apple empenada after 8pm and we waited over 20 minutes! The staff came out and offered us a free drink, but this hasn't been the only time we've had to wait. I also don't like that you can only order taco bell items from their drive thru. The drive through is consistently long and frequently blocks parking in the area as well. Overall, if you have to get something fast, try Subway or McDonalds in the same area. The chances of you getting in and out of her in less than 15+ minutes is highly unlikely.

I've struggled to find a good place in Gilbert so I sought this out of the way place out after seeing good reviews. I'm happy to report all is true! Friendly greeting and they offered me a bottle of water as soon as I arrived. It had been awhile since my last manicure so I took a lot of work, but they lady did excellent. Took the time to trim my cuticles and my gel polish looks awesome! Would highly recommend :) Looking forward to a pedi next time, their massage chairs looked great!  UPDATE: Their pedi chairs, while they do offer a decent massage, are SO uncomfortable. My butt still hurts from sitting in them earlier this morning :( And I have a lot of cushion if you know what I mean lol... I will definitely go back for the gel mani, but I'll skip the pedi. $60 for both gel mani and pedi w/ callus remover

I had a BOGO coupon for Ono Hawaiian BBQ, so we stopped by one evening after work. I wanted just plain chicken, so I got the breaded style chicken. My husband opted for the same and teriaki. The chicken had a lot of fat in it - very chewy. The breaded chicken had very little flavor and was dry. They give you rice and macaroni salad with meals - both were standard. Took quite awhile for our food to come out. It cost over $15 with the BOGO coupon. We won't be back.

I love the QT kitchen they have. So many good, quick options for cheap! I've heard the milkshakes are the best, and I know for a fact their cinnamon sugar pretzels are awesome. They are freshly made (haven't been sitting in a window) and come with icing.   Loss of star because polar pops at circle k are cheaper and do stay colder longer than the drinks here. I also didn't think they had that big of a selection of dairy groceries, which is usually why I stop at places like this (quick gallon of milk or thing of eggs).

Went in for the Veterans Day special. Waited over 1.5 hours to be seated (pretty sure someone else claimed our name as we were waiting outside), but we knew we'd have to wait. Service was outstanding - kind and quick. The mozzarella sticks were delicious (some of the best I've had). All our dinners were tasty. My only negative was price. It was way too expensive of a place to frequent - maybe will return for a special occasion. Nice "homey" decor as well.

They don't have enough choices on the menu, and the ones they do are over priced. I'm not a fan of paying $10+ for an ultra thin pizza with hardly any toppings. I've gotten the potato soup here before, it was good but not enough to keep me coming back. Service was not friendly.

What is ever bad about In N Out? Typical spot, same decor as any other. Quick, friendly service with delicious burgers and frys. Milkshakes are outstanding and you have to get extra spread for the fries (it's free just ask). Parking gets a little crazy and the bathrooms are always to small, but I can easily overlook that once I get my food.

We live very close to this place, and have considered it a few times just never committed until the other day. I got the groupon (pay $13, get $25) and the 5 of us went in. It was empty on a Saturday afternoon. LOTS of seating inside. From the look of the outside I was nervous it'd be kind of gross inside, but it's not. Could use some updates, but it's clean. Service was friendly, although our waitress wasn't overly knowledgable about their beer selection.   You MUST get the nachos. OMG - so delicious. The chips must be deep fried so they're almost like wantons. SO good!! The pizza wasn't that great, doughy, so I'd try something different next time/wouldn't recommend that. They have waffle fries and tots to choose from! Burgers looked good, same with the sandwiches. LOTS of menu choices so you won't go hungry :-)

First time and I wasn't impressed. Chicken is flavorless, dry and way too pricey. Will not return.

I love the wide range of options at this marketplace!! I prefer this place over the majority of the malls in the area. We live close to San Tan Village (similar concept), but Marketplace does it better. Many more options and big name stores! Makes for a nice outing in this beautiful fall weather - lots to look at even if you don't want to spend money!

We went, as a party of 6, for the first time yesterday. I liked the menu options - lots of choices. The lunch menu was cheap, many options under $10! I got the stuffed baked potato with bbq chicken. I could barely finish the whole thing - SO yummy!! Decent service, our server seemed new, didn't know much about the beer selection or menu. Everyone left impressed with the food though, and we'll return again!

This was really neat to walk through. We came in January 2016 and it was all decorated for the Chinese new year! Beautiful flowers, water features and greenery! Would highly recommend taking the time to walk through and enjoy it during your visit in Vegas. It's free :)

Came in for the Veterans Day menu and was really impressed with their regular menu prices. Big portions. Not a whole lot of variety, however. I can see it might be awhile until I want that kind of food again.   I loved that they had the tablet things at the table. We played life while we waited - very fun!! Fantastic service too!!

I just moved here from Southern California and this is the first Mexican place I've tried. Great selection, but simple menu.  Good happy hour specials. Great prices and HUGE portions! I had the chicken flautas and cheese quesadilla and it was WAY too much - had to take most of it home.

Beautiful stadium! Came here for an OSU pre season game. They had a nice big area set up for the tailgater, and also a wide variety of food options at concessions. The stadium seats were nice, but pretty crammed together like any other place. There was a grass section on the other side.

The custard is SO yummy!! I got the pecan sundae and it was delicious. I'm obsessed with cheese curds and theirs are OK, but not exceptional. Way too much breading. The service is always great at Culvers and the place is clean!

Standard red robin. Same menu. I love the variety of choices you have as far as buns, toppings, fry sauces, etc. I love their drinks as well - milkshakes, refillable root beer floats, strawberry lemonade... all good!   You have to sign up for their royalty card, it's free. Buy 9 get 1 free on burgers. Also, pretty much every Tuesday during NFL season you get a free Tavern Double with the purchase of another burger. Score!   Service is ok. Place always seems clean. Would recommend for a good burger for a decent price - especially if you are hungry :-)

Want a lot of dinner for for a little money? Come here! The 2 for $14.99 deal is every day now (just earlier thur-sun). You get two sides and an entree. I always get chicken strips and you get so many I take plenty home to eat the next day for lunch. The rolls are delicious, and the servers are always willing to bring you more. Service is outstanding here - always quick to refill drinks and get you anything you need. Fried pickle app is tasty! Happy hour beers are cheap. Would highly recommend! Oh and there are peanuts :-)

I'm a fan. Love the peanuts that you can throw on the floor. Good menu choices. I always get the steak, but last time I got the chicken critters. SO much food and they were delicious :-) Had lunch for the next two days with my left overs. Husband got the pulled pork sandwich which he also enjoyed. Will return for more... :)

We are huge fans of the pretzel burger - delicious!! Be sure to sign up for their e-club or grab a coupon from the paper. They almost always have a BOGO offer or $10off/$30+ deal going. Their apps are a little spendy. Mozzarella sticks are ok. Didn't care for the chips and cheese - dip tasted like bean dip and was heavily seasoned.  I love their biscuits - yummy! Salad bar I think is overpriced at $8.99.   Loss of a star because service is a toss up - sometimes it's good, sometimes not so good. Never excellent. We usually go before 5pm, so maybe they don't have their all stars on staff at that time, I don't know. Overall good and will keep going back.

I just moved here from CA, so you can imagine my delight when i found one of our own here :-)  Just as good as the ones in CA with the added benefit of a shorter line!! We went at 8pm on a Friday (when it would be out the door and around the block in CA) and walked right up to order. Delicious! :-)

This place is crazy busy! There are a thousand pedicure chairs and a million employees running around. We quickly got seated for our pedicure (I had called ahead to made an appointment which I highly recommend you doing if you want to get in on a Saturday) & shortly after another woman came over to start my mani at the same time. This is OK if you are in a hurry, but if you want to relax it's not for you. Doing a gel manicure in the pedicure chair you have to twist and turn and watch what they are doing so you don't smudge anything... it's a pain! My manicurist made two of my cuticles bleed bad and my pedicure massage was nothing spectacular... Needless to say I'll be finding another regular spot.  Overall if you need a mani/pedi and you are already here, it's OK but prepare to be over stimulated by the rush of the shop and perhaps leave with bloody cuticles :(

I'm not a huge fan of wings, so I ordered chicken strips. I was really impressed with the quality. Really crunchy and tasty! This place really earns stars for me because of the fried pickles and cheese curds - my two favorites at one place! And they have beer. Come for happy hour and save a few bucks. It is pretty loud in here, so be prepared for that. Service is so-so.

This place is AMAZING. My mom and I went recently and were in awe of all the great, healthy choices!  I got a small salad, and it was NOT small - GREAT portions!  The soup and mac n cheese were also delicious! It's kind of like Panera bread, if you're familiar with them, but in my opinion this place is MUCH better!

I like this place for a simple dinner. Good prices on steak, salads, etc. Please be warned that the "onion petals" are NOT the same as the blooming onion at Outback like your server will tell you. That being said service is OK (kind of slow at times, and not too personable). And you can't beat $2.99 beers and 2/$14 meals! Love their rolls and peanuts!!

After bouncing around resteraunts on a Friday night, sick of the wait times we stopped by Old Chicago. There was no wait here and I thought that might be a bad sign, but it wasn't. We got the italian nachos - so yummy! And split a create your own pasta. Many, many options on the menu, so it would be a good fit for just about anyone. The pizza looked good. We got fried pickles as well, but I wouldn't recommend them. Spicy! Lots of TVs around if you wanted to catch a game.  Overall we will be back to try other things on the menu and would recommend it.

My husband and I both have visited their office within the past month and have been pleased with their attentive service and friendly staff. Our new insurance pays for very little, but the prices here are reasonable. In fact, after calling around we found they were cheaper than most for crowns. Would highly recommend. Beautiful facility!

Did my nails turn out OK? Yes.  I got a mani/pedi both with gel/shellac.  It took FOREVER to get in (no, we didn't make an appointment).  The pedi chairs were SO uncomfortable, the things were just stabbing me in the back. No padding.  The nickel and dime you for services, by the time I left it was over $80 w/ a small tip (I always feel guilty)...  The lady who did my nails was sweet, but slow.  She did my toes and finger nails at the same time at a nail desk. She kept telling me to lift my leg up and down to put polish on. It was uncomfortable, a work out really that I didn't want at the nail salon!  My mom didn't get her nails done, but they kept coming around to her and asking if she wanted them done (at least five times) while she was waiting for me to get done. Kind of pushy...  Oh and the TV didn't work at all. It kept cutting out like they didn't pay for it they were just getting it from someone else in the complex?

Great place to get a pedicure and gel manicure! Service is always good. Chairs are so very comfy!! I would recommend making an appointment though because walk ins are usually impossible.. "Can you come back in 2 hours?"  It usually costs around $70 + tip to get a pedicure and gel manicure. Pricey, but I like that the service and cleanliness is consistent!

I am a big fan of froyo and this place falls short! First, the smell coming in is bad. To be honest (and I know this sounds harsh) it smelled like the place I take my dogs to for daycare. Not the delicious, inviting smell I was looking for. Next, there are no sample cups. I just have to guess if I'm going to like something. Their flavors are standard. There are no waffle cups. Customer service was so-so. I will say that their toppings were great, lots of variety there (2 star worthy). All in all, I will not be returning. I would rather drive the extra 20 minutes to Menchies.

I LOVE the outback but this was by far the worst experience I have had at one. We got here at 4 and were seated in the bar. Erika G was our server and she ran past our table a dozen times before acknowledging us. She brought us bread (which was horribly stale) and disappeared for longer before buzzing by again to speedily take our order. She seemed to have no patience. I told her it was my friend's birthday and she said they didn't do anything for that, but could maybe get a scoop of ice cream. OK, yes we'd like that. My baked potato (which I usually love because of all the salt on the side) was cold and a bit hard and my steak was SO thin!! I also remember liking their caesar salad, but this time it was all light green/white lettuce which is not what I like...   Overall I was very disappointed with the dinner. If I pay $50 to go out for a friend's birthday I want to enjoy it. I didn't. Wouldn't recommend this location. I've heard the one at superstition springs is good though.

Typical Kohls.  I do think their customer service/returns department goes above and beyond for their customers. I had bought a few pairs of nice dress capris, only to find out they weren't allowed at work. Unfortunately I had already taken the tags off. Kohls still refunded me for them!!

The optometrist was great! Very friendly and gave me free samples of my contacts and solution.  The optometrist staff was unprofessional in my opinion. Their attire looked dirty and they were less than informative. Very chatty with each other. The saleswoman Donna, however was very helpful in regards to getting me information regarding my insurance benefits. Unfortunately they didn't have the Coach glasses I was looking for, otherwise I would have bought from her!!

Everything you could possibly want hair wise (minus the Le'Occtane brand which I can only seem to find online and at Nordstrom) is here. I really like their wide selection of CHI products, however they are all "ULTA CHI". I'm assuming that they are the same as other CHI products, but I don't know. I recently purchased a CHI curling wand here, and it works great. The review section on the ULTA website is really helpful - have it handy as you shop, as the customer service/employees here can be few and far between (thus the loss of a star). They always have a coupon in the mail, so be sure to subscribe!

I love BJs! They have so many options in their menu, but the deep dish pizza is the best. My absolute favorite pizza! They do put tomatoes on every pizza, so if you don't like them make sure you request it without. Great service at this location. It was a busy Friday night, but our waitress didn't make us feel rushed at all and was very kind. Tried the corn fritters for an app which were very tasty too!

We stayed here for two nights in June of 2013, during the EDC weekend (we were not participants).  Great breakfast Free wifi Free parking NO resort fee!!! Within walking distance of the monorail, not too sure about the deuce. We just parked at the flamingo and walked from there. Pool is a little chilly. No hot tub.  The staff wasn't overly friendly, but I enjoyed our stay! We stayed in the suite with two queens and a pull out. No room separation, one room, three beds.   Overall nice and I'd stay again!!

This place is great! I got a living social deal for $39 for facial, make up application, partial highlights and hair cut. Wow, right?!   My facial was heavenly. I felt so relaxed and my face feels great! Ive hqd facials done at other salons and beauty achools and this one ranks among the best. And for the price i could easily come get pampered once a month.   My make up application was alright. I asked for a more natural look (I didn't want to leave with bright red lips, etc) so she hardly put anything on. Had to fix when I got home, but I looked at the make up part of the package as an unnecessary extra (a freebie) so I can't complain.   My highlights and cut were done very well. I loved that the instructors were constantly coming around to check in, but in a very casual, helpful way. My stylist was extremely nervous, was shaking almost the entire time and didn't say more than five words to me, but hey my cut and color looks awesome and it was super cheap. Again I can't complain.   All in all remember this is a school. It took five hours for my service, back to back. If you are short on time, don't come here. Be sure to look for a deal before you come or use the check in offer here on yelp :-)

I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, but my husband is. For his birthday he wanted Chinese food and this was the closest one to our house (well actually Asia Buffet was, but no). I immediately fell in love when we sat down because they brought... won ton chips with sweet and sour sauce!! My favorite!! I was even more impressed when all of their dinner options were under $10 (included rice, egg roll and shrimp won ton something). We went again for lunch today and it was even cheaper - most lunches under $6 (included soup, rice, a smaller portion of entree, egg roll and shrimp won ton something). If you're looking for a delicious Chinese option that's cheap - go here!! The service is also super fast. We were in and out of there within 45 minutes at dinner.

My brother just moved here to go to ASU and said this was "the nicest theatre" he's ever been to... I'm not sure if I'll go that far, but it is clean and the stadium seats are pretty neat.  Movies are just so expensive to go to anymore... I would highly recommend getting the reusable harkins cup, only $1.50 to refill. And I've heard that if you save your popcorn bag and come back in a relatively short time (a week maybe) they will refill that for free.

Standard Costco. Hamburger, cheese and soda are the big things we get here. Being just the two of us, much else in bulk is silly/wasteful. I appreciate that the food on the way out (pizza, dogs, etc) now takes debit card. Finally! Gas is cheap here too!

I was so nervous to leave our only child (pup) anywhere, but I'm happy to say this place is pretty amazing!! They took the time to get to know our dog, and let us try out the day care experience for a short while today before leaving him all day next week. Some people have posted that it "smells" - what can you expect, it's full of dogs for goodness sake!! It looks very clean inside, and the people running the business are professional and kind. Couldn't be happier that we finally found a place to leave our pup during the busier days!!

I went in today to use a Groupon I bought. It was $45 for partial, cut and style. The lady I typically go to (at another salon) is fabulous, but she's getting to pricey so I figured I'd try something new, and cheaper!   Pros: Lisa was terrific! She did a good job and I'm happy with my service. I'd recommend her! Took about 2.5 hours from start to finish. Decent time. They are a full service salon. They do nails, facials, waxing, etc! She said the men's haircuts were only like $15. I might have my husband come here because great clips can't seem to get a fade right. I was able to get in the very next day after I called. They gave me a cute welcome packet with coupons for later services.  Cons:  I'm used to the other salon that uses organic products, so the smell of my hair is less than desirable (there's no smell with organic). The salon is older and a little small. Your discussion will be heard by everyone in the salon pretty much. Without the groupon, I'm not sure if it's really a cheaper option for me. But it's another great place to go.

This review is simply for the Christmas lights display. This was the first year I had visited, and I took my parents from out of town along. The lights were beautiful, but didn't take us long to walk through. I would recommend coming on a night when a local choir was performing, just so you have more to do/see. There was a fun food truck court set up across the street, which was an added bonus. Would recommend if you had kiddos who liked lights.

Our dog snagged his nail on our carpet last night (Saturday) & it was bleeding pretty bad. Of course all vets were closed so we did our best to stop the bleeding at home and began to search for somewhere open Sunday. Thus we ended up here! Love that they are open 7 days a week! They got us in on short notice and only charged us a vet visit to fix up the nail. $55 but hey, its Sunday! Happy to pay it to know my pup isnt in pain. The vet was really nice too.  They did show us the "buy our wellness plan" video, but weren't pushy on the sales end beyond that. In fact for how many times we go to the vet (as first time pet owners we may be a little more paranoid) it almost seems like a good deal!  Would recommend for weekend needs and for individuals who would consider buying the wellness plan.

Avoid this place if you value your time and money.    I went in to see if they could order me a retainer. I had lost mine and they assured me that the dentist (not the ortho) could do it.  They told me on the phone that they would check my insurance to see what they covered before I arrived.  I made an appointment ahead of time and arrived at the office early.  I had even printed out all the new patient forms to hand in so I had no paperwork to fill out in the office - I was prepared, they were not.  I waited in the waiting room for at least 10 minutes, and then an additional 10 minutes of waiting once they took me to the back.  The dentist looked in my mouth for 10 seconds and told me he could order a retainer (yes, your front office already told me that...). It wasn't until THEN that they decided to check with my insurance. At 6pm on a weekday, the insurance of course was swamped with calls and it took over 30 minutes (of me waiting alone in the back, no one checking in on me) to get a response.    Then on top of all the waiting they decided to charge me $40 for the visitation? I understand that a dentist's time is valuable but he literally took 10 seconds to look in my mouth.  So basically I'm paying $40 for the front office staff to make a call to my insurance company, something they could have done days before.   I will not be going back. $40 might not seem like a lot, but for a complete waste of an evening for nothing it means something to me! If you value your time and money, avoid. Try somewhere that makes the consultation experience quick and free so that the customer will actually come back and drop $400 on a new retainer which I will ultimately do elsewhere.

They are a little lacking in customer service. No warm greeting like at other breakfast locations. Also their drive thru window looks like a broom closet, not sure what's going on back there, but not exactly where I want my food. The bottom line: their bagels are to die for. The mega cheese one is my favorite. Love that they put the cream cheese on for you. Their coffee isn't bad either. Much cheaper way to start your morning (compared to starbucks at least)

Today was my first visit and I will most definitely come again. The ladies were super sweet. They let us take our time picking out colors and answered all our questions. They do SO much more with gel polish than other salons around. They do ombre and have a huge selection of colors and designs to choose from!! Next time ill get a mickey mouse design, too cute. Chairs were comfy, the price was reasonable ($65 for gel and the highest priced pedi with paraffin, hot stone), & the service was great too.  Would highly recommend :)

We came in to buy a new Hookah, and the guy behind the counter was extremely helpful. He quickly showed us several options and let my husband feel the weight difference between the cheaper and more expensive options. We got a shorter and cheaper hookah here than we have had in the past, yet it works far better! Glad we stopped and appreciate the service! Wide variety of shisha as well.

Beautiful park! There are small ponds and plenty of walking paths. They even have well lit basketball and sand volleyball courts! Often packed on the weekends due to youth sports.  Only cons are that the walking paths are super dark at night (wouldn't feel comfotable going alone) and I wish they had an area for dogs to go off the leash.

I'm a huge smashburger fan, but this location lacks customer service. I'm a picky eater (sorry not sorry) so I have a few items I don't want on my burger. The lady was in such a rush she screwed up both mine and my husband's order. Their set up is awkward as far as how you get back to the counter to handle any issues with your burger. It's almost as if you are blocked from doing so. Anyway, when my burger is made right I LOVE how smashburger does it. I just think this particular location could use some help. I highly recommend the smash fries - YUM!

Love love love their pizza and prices!! I never order take out anymore after countless screw ups by cheap delivery pizza places around here (just gross). I'm thankful we have a Barros close to enjoy tasty pizza for a decent price. Queen Creek HS football even has a dicount card they sold for Barros. Love their lunch specials (under $5 bucks for slices and a drink). Seating can accommodate a variety of group sizes.

Standard location. Older. Lots of choices. We went for the $1 scoop nights and it was packed. Difficult to see all the different kinds when more than 4 people are in here (very small). Very little seating so don't bring a big group. Cakes looked delicious in the case - lots to choose from!  Overall I think I prefer cold stone if I'm in the mood to spend $5+/person on ice cream.

Such a good burger!! So juicy and delicious!! Lots of choices and they are all... FREE (except for a select few)!! Their fries are OK. I prefer in-n-outs better, but I'll live. My biggest complaint is the price. It takes longer than any fast food joint to get your burger and it's double the price. Yes, they are delicious, but it's still just a burger. I do really like the fact that they have peanuts to snack on while you're waiting! That does help.

Not impressed. Bought a groupon, but still paid well above what I expected to for a small pizza, app and one beer $29. All draft beer here is $6/16oz. The pretzel app was tasty, but it was simply pizza dough in a pretzel shape. Beer cheese was ok, but cost just as much as the pretzels ($3.29). The hostess staff is in booty shorts which I don't prefer to look at while eating (call me a prude haha). The vibe is trendy, but inauthentic. I was hoping for a neighborhood type feel and some good pizza - this place falls short of that.  Overall I wouldn't recommend and won't be frequenting this place.

I had the BBQ burger with onion straws and bacon, the Oreo shake and Smash fries (rosemary & olive oil) - all of which were delicious!! Three of us went and it was $30 for three burgers, 2 fountain drinks, 1 shake and 2 fries. Kind of pricey for a small burger joint, but if you're looking for something a step above In-N-Out and are willing to pay a few extra bucks it's worth it! The location is nice as it is right next to Harkins theatre in the Tempe Marketplace. I also liked that they served beer (in bottles and cans).  That is just a nice option for us grown ups and one you don't see very often out of a small burger joint.    Price is why it lost a star and why I won't make this a regular place to eat. I could go to Red Robin and get all you can eat fries, and a much bigger burger for the same price.

I have gone to Verde twice now, after a recommendation from a friend who has gone there much longer.  I see Maryn and she's great. Fun to talk with and excellent at what she does! The front desk lady is a total sweetheart, always eager to make your experience the best. They do a good job of getting you in on a timely manner, and always make me feel pampered by the time I leave. The salon itself is also beautiful. Very clean and crisp colors/decorations. The fact that they use all organic products is just an extra plus! I get my hair highlighted, and have for some time, and I LOVE that I don't go home smelling like chemicals. My hair feels great and I feel great when I leave! Would highly recommend!! Please know though that this is not your discount salon - they use quality products and employ experts which implies a higher yet fair price.

I just moved to Tempe from Gilbert and love this location so much more!! The front desk isn't gossipy while you wait, they are kind and actually pay attention to you - the customer!  The best part about this place however is Lucy! I've been getting waxed for about 3 years now, mostly at european, and this is honestly the first time it hasn't hurt. Like at all. Hallelujah!   They will try to up sell you after your appointment,  but it is a good deal if you have the money. If you don't they back off pretty quick :)

I stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon and they quickly got me seated. Nice pedi chairs, but the massage on them was a little rough. Lots of color choices. No crazy upsell techniques. The man who did mine spoke great English and was able to help me create the look I wanted. My gel mani looks great and they did NOT make my cuticles bleed.   The basic pedi was under $30 and included hot stone massage! $5 extra for callus remover (pretty standard). I made it out of there with a pedi and gel mani without spending more than $50!! Score!!  Would highly recommend.

We had Dr. Pifer yesterday for a quick exam for my dog to get caught up on his shot. Front desk staff was very kind and got me in right away. The only thing I didn't like about this place was the fact they take the dog in the back for temperature.  I don't understand why they can't do everything in the room with the owner. The doctor was super informative and took the time to answer my questions. A lot of times vets seem rushed, but he didn't at all. Very pleased and will come back again. Kind of a weird area of tempe, but office was clean and professional.

Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had, and I don't really like Chinese food. My husbands friend is from China and he recommended the place. He even went with us and ordered in Chinese. The menus are all in Chinese and English - very authentic with many, many choices!   Family style dining with a big lazy susan in the middle to make sharing easy. Loved the orange chicken - lightly breaded with no chewy fat pieces like I'm so used to getting at other places. My brother got the sweet and sour ribs and they were also delicious.   Would highly recommend - its even cheap, under $10 a plate (big enough for 2-3 people to eat from with complimentary rice)

A luxurious movie going experience! We were in the area and needed to waste a few hours before an event, so we grabbed the groupon ($5/movie) and went inside. The lobby is HUGE and you aren't bombarded with the smell of popcorn upon arrival (pro or con? I'm not sure...).   You choose your seats, so I can see how getting their late, or going to a newer movie might lead to some anxiety of not getting the seat you want. You can reserve online ahead of time.   The menus were nice - lots of options. I was most impressed with the daily specials (ie. Wed/Sun $10 all you can eat pizza - say what!?). Milkshakes and 2 for $25 meals were also appealing!  Lost a star for the chairs being so darn uncomfortable and the fact that you have to smell whatever your neighbor ordered for dinner through the entire movie (sorry, I'd rather just smell popcorn, at least I know what I'm getting). Overall I'd highly recommend if you want a unique date night idea or if you want to enjoy dinner and a movie simultaneously.

Came for the first time on St. Patty's day for the green beer and have been back a few times since because the food is really good! I highly recommend the $10 grilled cheese. It's HUGE! Take it home for lunch the next day! My brother tried the peanut butter burger and said it was great - little too weird for me. Tons of options for anyone in your dining party. They even have gluten free food and beverages! Wish I would have taken a picture of their happy hour and daily specials. I do remember Thursdays they have 1/2 price pizzas, which are tasty! Would highly recommend. It is a little loud though. Also, don't be deceived if the parking lot/outside is packed - it's a big place, you will get a seat! Fried pickles are bomb here too.  Lost a start because children run wild here. I like kids, but there are a TON here that are unsupervised, slamming the shuffle board pieces against the wall (it's already loud enough in here), and bumping into you as they run through the aisles. I wish parents or staff would advise them to stay in their seat as it doesn't make a fun dining experience for others when they run wild.

If you are interested in a variety of greasy food in an "ok" setting for an "ok" price then this is your place. Looks pretty run down. A variety of choices, but none that looked all that fresh... felt sick when I left. Two stars because my husband loves it.

Such a fun place to go for happy hour!! Their prices are great, service is excellent and the food is so yummy!! You MUST try the beer cheese with soft pretzels - to die for!! I was grateful our server went over each of the beers they had on tap with us, and I ended up trying several different kinds I wouldn't have had he not suggested them. Would highly recommend!!

Best breakfast place I have been to in Mesa. The service was quick. I loved how they left a pot of coffee at your table, so you didn't have to wait for a refill. I had the four peaks french toast and it was YUMM-azing. My husband had the regular egg/bacon/potatoes and he loved it. We recently had a bad experience at Denny's and realize that cheap does not equal quality... This place far exceeds the Denny's experience and it was still under $20 for the two of us to eat. Would highly recommend. Nice outdoor seating too! Parking lot is a little cramped.

Save your $ and time, go somewhere else!  1st there are a TON of "snow birds" that eat here. I mean the entire place is covered with white haired individuals and you will overhear their loud conversations about the "multiple surgeries" and "horrible symptoms" of this and that... It's obnoxious. In fact, when we walked in two elderly couples blatantly cut in front of us. The lady at the register saw it, and did nothing. Evidently, unless your old you are second rate here.  2nd on a Friday night at 6pm they were out of salmon? What? So we both got the alfredo. Bad choice. Even our waitress commented "I think it's disgusting here"... why is it on the menu then for $13.99?! It tasted like a smart ones microwavable dinner. Gross and watery with ZERO flavor.    3rd their salad bar was OK - no tomato soup, onion rings, sprinkles or cheese toast (staple items at the Sizzler I once worked at).  Overall, we paid over $30 for bad service and terrible food. We won't be back and I don't recommend it!

We called ahead of time, but they refused to take our order over the phone (we were a large group in a hurry). Our waitress insisted she could get us in and out quickly, but didn't. Service was slow and the waitress was anything but friendly. At the end she even got upset with our big group when we asked for separate checks... will not go again!

I love Winco, and this store is no exception. Being an Oregonian, they always keep me well stocked with the tillamook brand items you just can't seem to find anywhere else (yogurt, ice cream, etc)! Also in love with the Sanitas chips and bandon cheese (recently bought by tillamook, cheaper and just as good - who can eat that off brand cheese? not me).  Beware that you do have to bag your own groceries (this adds a little stress to my shopping trip, but nothing unmanageable - bring helpers if possible) and they only take debit/cash. I have found that they are typically cheaper than the other grocery stores, and they have a whole lot more to offer.

My husband and I moved in here in July 2013 and love it. Yes, we fell in the love with the granite counter tops and the beautiful amenities around the property.  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because of our crazy neighbor downstairs (she claims we are stomping everyday, all day) and the price (if only it was a bit cheaper).  The parking at any apartment complex is typically garbage, so I'm not going to complain about that. As long as I get home before 5 (I'm a teacher) I get a parking spot right next to my apartment. If I get home a little later, I park maybe half a block away - big deal, exercise won't kill you! I've never found any bugs in my apartment, however my friend who lives here as found a few and the office has quickly and kindly put her on the pest control list.  She hasn't had any problems since.  All my conversations with the office staff have been kind (especially regarding crazy neighbor). The garages are NOT $100, they are $50, which is pretty reasonable for this area. Carports I believe are $25. Those are luxuries that you do not need, but if you want them expect to pay.    This may not be a property for everyone, but it has been a great choice for my husband and I. I love the pool and the fitness center - even the business center is a nice plus! Our dog enjoys the grass around the property (I do wish they had a dog area that was gated).  Something to look into and you can't beat the location!!

Very cool store. They have everything game stop has, but more. And most stuff was even cheaper. They have a huge gaming lounge in the back with TVs and tables. I saw you can even rent it out for a party. When we went in they were about to have a Pokémon tournament.   Would highly recommend!

This location is great. Very clean interior with friendly staff. The ordering process isa  little overwhelming at first (SO many choices), but our food came out deliciously. Their burgers are SO juicy and delicious. I love their smash fries w/ rosemary - unique and scrumptious. We also tried their fried pickles for the first time and I was really impressed with how tasty those were as well (not as greasy as you might expect). Prices are a little high for a burger at a fast food-ish type place, but I think it's well worth it. Would highly recommend!

This is has become my go to place for breakfast if I'm in a hurry. I have to be to work by 6am, so the fact that they are open in the wee hours of the morning is AWESOME! In fact, they are open 24/7 so no matter what your work/life schedule is like, they are there and ready for you to stuff your face with donuts!  I like their ice coffee w/ vanilla and their croissants. My husband said their donuts were a little on the small side, but good. I stopped in one day to get donuts for a staff meeting, and I was surprised at how cheap their donuts by the dozen were!  Lost a star for the sometimes difficult to understand drive through system and the fact that they don't have much of anything I'd want after breakfast hours.

A cute (but slightly hidden) spot in Queen Creek.  The staff was the best - friendly, attentive and quick! My coworkers and I met here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and found they had a great meeting table towards the back which worked perfect for our discussion.  Lots of choices and delicious beverages! Would try again, but I don't live out in QC anymore - but if I'm in the area, or if you are I'd highly recommend trying them out!

We've been here a few times with a BOGO coupon. The customer service is great, food comes out quickly and they have a fairly large menu to choose from. We have always just gotten breakfast items and all have been delicious. I highly recommend, in the winter, to try their different flavored hot cocoas. So yummy!

I'm a big fan of cousins. I love their bread and their curds mostly, but the service is ways friendly too! This location doesn't have the subway type set up - they just have you choose a sandwich that has specific toppings on it. You can always add/subtract items from it though, just not as easily. They also offer online ordering here, which is cool.  Look for a coupon in the mail. Lots of BOGO!

Just stopped in to take a look around. Customer service was AWFUL! Three guys just standing behind counter. No one said hello or asked if we needed any help. Just looked at us oddly as we walked in and then back out a bit later. Would have loved to learn some information. Lost a sale guys!

Lost a star because this place is EXPENSIVE!   But it's also delicious... So if you can afford to fork over $40+ for a small pizza and drinks -- go! This location has MUCH friendlier service than it's Tempe counterpart (on Mill). Quick as can be with made to order pizza. I love the pretzels and beer cheese - yum! Can't go wrong with them, but again the price for just the cheese is $3.50+... Love the decor!! And it's huge - good for groups :-)

They have outstanding burgers - juicy and full of flavor. I tried the pretzel burger the other night and it was so delicious!  They often have pretty good coupons in the mail too, so keep your eye out (buy one get one half off makes date night under $20)! We got the chips and quest appetizer last time, loved the chips not so much the queso.  It loses its star due to the salad bar. I feel like they make such a huge deal about it when really it doesn't offer much. I'd like to see them add more fruit and maybe some cottage cheese. Service has always been great, however the hostess could have worn a longer skirt (we saw way too much every time she walked by)

After visiting this place a few more times I am absolutely addicted! Everyone I have taken with me loves it too. I'm not a huge veggie person so Which Wich is perfect - there are LOTS of other options other than the veggie/healthy stuff (crispy onion strings OMG!!). My brother likes it too because he says the sandwich makers aren't judging you (as they do at Subway it seems) when you say no to all the veggies going down the line. Just grab your bag, mark what you want and you got it!  Be sure to sign up for their "Vibe Club" to get extra savings (free sub on your birthday and lots of other discounts).  Buy the larger drink for 50cents more for a cup you can keep/reuse and bring it back for 50cents off your next visit!

They lost a star because they are so darn expensive. But we all know that won't change anytime soon...  Love that they are open early so that I can grab some coffee on my way to work at 5am! They are always friendly, but not creepy like the people at Dutch can be sometimes lol.   My favorite is the white chocolate peppermint mocha or the americano with cream and peppermint or the berry refresher... or just about anything.    Would highly recommend over Kneaders next door.

Maybe I should have known how quick and lame this would be before I spent time and money on it, but I didnt... I will never do this again and I would not recommend it. We got tickets for 11pm on a Saturday and waited over 1.5 hours IN LINE!!! Why on earth do they have ticket times and then make you wait for so long?? Complete waste of an evening for 30 seconds. We had family waiting below to take our pictures too, what a buzz kill for all!! Don't do!!

I'm a huge fan of the Which Wich brand. I think it's fast, convenient and you get exactly what you want! Be sure to sign up for the e-club, as they send coupons frequently for free drinks, subs and more. This location is always very clean. Parking stinks here, as you have to pay at the curb or walk from somewhere. Would highly recommend over subway, quiznos, etc! Way more options and a cheaper price!!

I'm in love with Menchies! They have outstanding customer service. Every time I've been in they immediately greet you with a smile, show you around, offer you sample cups and top it with a friendly farewell when you walk out the door. They have daily specials (I like waffle wednesday - 20% off your order if you get a waffle cup). Lots and lots of choices!! I also really enjoy the bright, colorful decor. You just leave feeling happy :-)

I have to say that the customer service is OUT OF THIS WORLD here!! There were two younger ladies working behind the counter and they were so nice and welcoming. It was my husband and I's first time and they recommended things and helped us out!  I can't tell you how much I appreciate service that actually appears to be enjoying their job. Very clean and cute decor too!   It lost a star only because they aren't the BEST wings I've ever had, but they are pretty darn close!! We got a 10pc strip meal with a large fry and two drinks. Then we had to add on the yeast rolls too (they looked so good).  WAY too much food for the two of us, but delicious all the same!! I got mild, but my husband said their hot is hot!!  Would highly recommend.

I'm in love with the fact there is a WinCo nearby now!! They have such a HUGE selection of all sorts of things, I don't know why anyone would shop anywhere else. Yes, some things are still cheaper at Walmart, but generally everything is about the same if not cheaper. They sent out a flier in the mail the other day proving it as a matter of fact!    Warning: You have to bag your own groceries, but they do have paper bags!  Unique suggestions: Shasta Soda (under 80 cents a 2ltr - great for parties), Tilamook icecream (which I can't seem to find anywhere else - as an Oregon native, it's a must) and their homemade pizza dough (in the cheese section - $1.25 for a quick delicious dinner, can't be beat!)

First let me say I'm a HUGE fan of all things cheesey and a growing fan of food trucks. For weeks I had been tracking Chedda on instagram waiting for him to be in the neighborhood. Zia Records, on records day, we were there. I was stoked!   Husband and I both got dirt bags (burger & cheese) & tots. Both lacked flavor. Both weren't cheesey. Both were disappointing. I almost cried. So much built up anticipation for... nada! And it set me back $19.  Burgers were huge, bun was thick and burnt. Tots tasted like bland mashed potatoes and the sauce was super odd. Wouldn't recommend.

I can't give it 5 stars, because I haven't ever ordered a burger which seems to be their "item". With that being said I think this is a great place to stop by and get a snack before/after a movie. We stop often to grab a nacho and fry to share - both are yummy. For under $10 we can get that and two drinks (which are refillable if you sit in the section by the restaurant. I see lots of people with NFL jerseys there on the weekends as they play the games.

This place is AWESOME!! I wish there was one out in East Mesa closer to where I actually live. I also wish the parking lot wasn't always so stinking packed. I bet they'd have a lot more customers if it wasn't such a crazy house trying to get in and out of a parking spot.   With that being said, imagine subway but for pizza! As many toppings as you want for one low price. I got the "mod" (medium) size the first time, but have gotten the small version ever since. It's a thin crust but very filling! And so fresh! The customer service is outstanding. You always are greeted with a smile and said goodbye to as you leave.   The absolute best thing about MOD? The lemonade... OMG! I think I would stop in here JUST for the lemonade. It's that good.  All in all, you need to try this place. Highly recommended. Fun place to take out of staters too. Unique concept anyone can be happy with. Gluten free options too!

Ok, they have cheese curds!! What delightful surprise last night. I had a coupon for buy two get one free sandwich, so I stopped by. Super friendly staff greeted us as we walked in. Clean dining area (it is new after all) with enough seating.   The service was a little slow, but they kept a conversation going with us so that helped pass the time. My hubby got the cheese steak and they cook it right in front of you, so that also explains why it takes longer than subway. Better quality. I loved my turkey on parm bread - delicious! The bread is outstanding, not too thick or overwhelming.   But the cheese curds... who would have known! Not the best, but better than Culvers! They also have fries! And then of course the standard sandwich shop chips and soda.   Would highly recommend - give em a try!

I'm a huge fan of cheese curds and, perhaps pathetically, often find myself dining at a place simply because cheese curds are on the menu. This is how I stumbled upon zzeeks - an ad came by our apartment and among a variety of other things curds were on the menu. I've ordered delivery from them a few times. Their pizza is good and their curds are AWESOME! We stopped in the other day to grab a beer and curds and wanted something else too, just not pizza. We opted for "pizza fries". Huge mistake. Unless you like soggy fries covered, I mean drenched, in marinara skip this item. Grab an extra curd instead. Several beers on tap. Coupons in the entertainment book. Had a good selection of lunch options too. Would recommend.

This is a review solely of the pool area and pool bar. We stopped by yesterday afternoon to visit some family staying here. With that said, I was very impressed with the pool area. Fun games (ping pong, yard jinga, etc) out to play. Nice loungers (although they looked a little stained) set up everywhere - plenty of seating. The hot tub is connected to the pool, which is nice. Easy access in and out! The bar had a few specialty drinks they offered, but we ended up getting a bucket of beer (5 for $23). Nice fire pit near the bar area too.  Would highly recommend a visit - I hear they have unique rooms and cheap rates for the area! Lots to do and see within walking distance.

My parents and I went on Friday and had a terrific experience. We asked for one hour of reflexology, and received a fantastic service. Very relaxing, and we all felt great leaving.  When you arrive they will have you answer a few brief questions regarding where you'd like them to focus and how much pressure you'd like. Then they lead you back to a bed. This location does not have curtains or separation between the beds (my dad did not like that, but once they get started I don't find that it matters much). You can pay $20 more for a private room with hot stones.   This is a full body massage for $40. Remember to tip generously if you enjoyed your service! I used to work reception at a reflexology place and I know they get much less than $40 for each customer.  Reason for the loss of star is 1) They didn't answer their phone. On yelp it said they opened at 9am, and I must have called at least a dozen times between 850 and 11am. Finally we just got in the car and went over there. They were in fact open, and we were able to get right in. 2) The location, right next to the restaurant, isn't great. You can, from time to time, hear what's going on over there, which isn't relaxing. With that being said it was minimal and probably non existent if you went in the morning.

I used to love Century Link, but after having to cancel due to a move outside their area I have received nothing but terrible customer service. I went here to drop of my equipment and the guy might as well have been a zombie. Zero personality. No thank you. No welcome. Nothing. The company as a whole needs to put some more effort into hiring customer service oriented people who don't come across as hating their job.

Great, friendly staff! I'm always able to walk in and rarely have to wait. They recently redid a lot of the salon and now have ipads at every pedi seat. More than necessary, but nice. He said there were lots of movies preloaded on each, but I didn't watch any. I also noticed they redid their "menu" which looked very nice. Again, great service, great pedicure massage and I would highly recommend!

Thankful we have a Starbucks in QC!! However, the wait is ridiculous! The drive-thru is seldom less than four cars deep. At this point I think they are still learning how to manage the high demand and it seems overly slow to me. Maybe in time they'll earn that extra star.
