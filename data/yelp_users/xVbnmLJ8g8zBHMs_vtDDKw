I have never, ever been disappointed by Pita Jungle. Usually we go to the Shea location but today at the Chandler location service was spectacular and super quick even though it was slammed. Everything on the menu here is outstanding.

UPDATE: Five people from SWAT towing have been arrested as the culmination of a 2 year investigation into their shady practices. San Marin is still allowing them to take advantage of residents. Let me reiterate in all caps: SAN MARIN IS STILL USING A PREDATORY COMPANY WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. DO NOT EVER MOVE HERE!!!  The problem here is three-fold:   1) They allow a notoriously predatory towing company to make judgment calls in the middle of the night on whether or not their own tenants are parked correctly. They appear to be more interested in allowing this predatory company (with a Better Business Bureau grade of C-!) to make money off their residents than in protecting those residents from predatory charges as well as the massive headache caused by getting one's car back from an impound lot that is nowhere near their home. After they were parked, you know, in the parking lot at their home.   2) They fail to inform their residents that they are in constant danger of being towed in the middle of the night if one or more of the vehicles around them move. The signs posted all over warn only that "unauthorized vehicles" will be towed. Nothing about "authorized vehicles deemed parked incorrectly by some guy in a tow truck in the middle of the night making money off the residents" will be towed. Nope. Just "UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES." And those spots on the east side are incredibly narrow. They know it, and they know most cars are going to be over the white line, yet there is no warning to residents (either posted or a little heads up when signing the lease) to avoid going over the white line even if it means not being able to park in their own homes. (And of course they don't tell residents that! Their response would be, "Hold on...you mean to tell me that if I'm going to be over the white line, I should leave the apartment complex and park blocks away from my own house?! Because it's more important to you that the towing company make money off your residents than your residents are protected? Hmm...let me think again about whether or not I want to sign this lease and live at a place that cares so little about its residents.") Which leads me to...   3) When this does happen, their response is to tell you that you "should've taken a picture"! You should've taken a picture. The apartment manager of the place where you live will inform you that the onus is on YOU, the paying resident, to prove that your "authorized vehicle" shouldn't have been towed in the middle of the night by a notoriously predatory towing company and some dude who gets to decide whether or not he wants to tow you. There is ZERO interest in protecting their residents. You'll be told that next time, you shouldn't even risk it; you should leave the property and walk home, in the dark, at 3 in the morning!

My favorite deli in the Valley. The chicken pesto sandwich is amazing, but they're ALL amazing. And there's no other place in the Southwest that comes as close to real, NY-style cookies.

One of my constant standbys, the Hell's Fire chips are outstanding and can be substituted for fries with the delicious sandwiches for a small addition. Sometimes the service is a bit slow when it gets busy, but it's worth the wait. Try to avoid evenings events are held at SMOCA or other areas of the Civic Center.

The service here is positively seamless. The food is always fresh and well-cooked and delicious. Wine pairings with the set menu are pricy but usually worth it. Highly recommend!

Great food but oh my god it's spelled LETTUCE! LETTUCE! Not "lettus"! Every single day - EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. the specials sign is so badly written it nearly gives me heart failure. I know that's not the most important thing here, but it really gives me pause. If you know for a fact that spelling and/or grammar is not your strong suit, just google. For the love of god, just GOOGLE.

Wow, the coffee here is amazing. They roast it on premises and it's thick and delicious. Don't forget to try the peanut butter cookie, and wash it down with the iced pomegranate green tea. Excellent service as well.

This place needs to hire people who actually have serving experience, instead of confused hipsters who match the decor. The servers, the food runners, the bussers, it's like no one has EVER worked in a restaurant before. They all run into each other, there's NO "behind you," "on your left", there's no helping each other out, they have NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING. They disappear for long stretches of time, they lie to their tables, they are just completely incompetent.   Never, ever going back to Eggstacy. The food is amazing but the service is ATROCIOUS. Two weekends in a row, our server (a different person each time) disappeared for 15-20 minutes. Last time he disappeared right before our food came out, and I had to wait 10 minutes for him to reappear so I could send back my omelette to get it with no mushrooms...the way I ordered it to begin with. Ok, no biggie, stuff happens, but the food is so, SO good I'm definitely going to give it another shot.  The second time, she just didn't even put our order in before she disappeared. First she didn't put our appetizer order in, then she took our main order and didn't put THAT in either! So we sit there, for OVER 40 MINUTES, as tables get sat around us, order from their server (not ours, we didn't see her at all for 20 minutes), GET THEIR FOOD, and eat all of it, and STILL WE DON'T HAVE OUR APPETIZER.   Then she comes rushing over to "double check" what we ordered and she flat out lied about forgetting to put our order in, and that's what pisses me off the most. People screw up, fine, but OWN IT and APOLOGIZE. We're not stupid. She finally admitted it, and of course my eggs were undercooked because the kitchen had to rush the entire order. UGH.   Never, ever again. Two visits, two instances of terrible service. Done.

Stellar service. We each had a sandwich and shared the pesto pasta and a pastry that was sort of like a cronut. It was ALL spectacular. The jalape√±o spread is amazing. I wish I didn't live so far away from this place because I could see myself having lunch here multiple times a week.
