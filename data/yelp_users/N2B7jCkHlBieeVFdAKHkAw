Home of the $20 all u can eat rice with a garnish of raw fish. The hand rolls are laughable: they are huge, and look like black skinned larvae engorged with crunchy rice.  The rice in the Nigiri and rolls was the worst I've tasted at any Japanese restaurant. Hard and flavorless, it was utterly unacceptable. Tasted like there was no vinegar or seasoning whatsoever.  The waitresses run around like rush hour traffic, bumping into each other and the teppan cooks.   The place was packed, which was unbelievable. Life's too short to eat bad sushi, people!!  Caveat Emptor.

Great novelty restaurant, as seen on TV!  The machaca and jerk chicken were pretty good, but the jerk fried rice had some very hard crunchy bits inside, maybe old fried rice nuggets?  The place is pretty big and very quiet on a weeknight. Very kid friendly. In fact, kids get free rice and gravy plus free drinks. A cheapskate delight!  The great wall of chino was unforgettable, and the staff very friendly and helpful.

I'm a fan of the embassy suites chain. Big rooms, nice buildings with large open atriums, free drinks at manager's reception and free cooked to order breakfast.   I know embassy suites, I've stayed at embassy suites....embassy suites tempe, you are NO embassy suites.  Here are my gripes in order of priority:  1. Heating was broken and a call to the front desk resulted in a promise to "fix it right away" but no follow up action. My dad who stayed with us froze his tail off at night and felt sick all weekend. Shame on you embassy suites for failing to care for the elderly. (Yes it does get cold in AZ in the winter!)  2. The Garcia's in the lobby makes the entire lobby reek of oily food smell. Great way to introduce the hotel to new guests. Walk in and smell the tex mex.   3. The service is ok at the front desk, but you are left feeling "on your own", much like a no frills hotel. I did not see "Embassy Suites Express" on the signage. The complex is huge, maze-like, and difficult to navigate. The front desk did not really help much with their directions to the room. My family was left wandering around far longer than they should have. This place is not like your traditional embassy suites with huge open air atrium. It looks more like a converted apartment complex.  4. The breakfast and happy hour area is just too small and cramped. I wasn't very happy when i can't even find a seat during happy hour.  5. The mini fridge did not work very well. It was barely cold enough to keep a drink lukewarm.  On the positive note, they did respond quickly to requests for extra towels and blankets. The furniture was new and clean. The bathroom and mini bar had granite tops. The gym was quite good with brand new equipment and TVs integrated into the elliptical and treadmills.  So there you have it. Stay there if you must, and try to hang out in the gym as much as possible.

The best time to get fantastic rates at the WIld Horse is when the temperature exceeds 115 degrees. My sister got a room for $58 and I got a room for $67 per night since I booked a little early on Hotwire. If you are able to do a last minute, you gonna get A DEAL!  The hotel is nicely decorated, with a grand entryway boasting a giant chandelier and statue of the most wild of horses. The rooms are clean, nicely decorated, and modern. If you ask for a bigger room, you might get lucky and get the rooms on the ends of the building which seem a few feet wider. The hotel part of the casino is smoke free so if you don't gamble you can avoid the smoke. They even have a non-smoking buffer slot machine area between the main floor and hotel portion, to further "airlock" from smoke.  The food court and restaurants are very convenient for a quick bite if you don't feel like leaving the complex, which can be a savior when the heat is oppresive outside. The pool is huge and clean. The towel checkout system is a bit strict but I guess saves them thousands of dollars a year on stolen towels.  The biggest complaint I have are the room keys. They would lose their ability to open the door about once a day and I had to get them re-keyed at the front desk countless times. Give me the old low tech solution...metal KEYS!  Anytime I have to stay in south Phoenix area, and it's an inferno outside, I'm freakin' there!

This place is pretty fantastic on the value based scale. They are cooking up some HK style delights that rival local California chinese restaurants. They even have the crappy service down to a T. Actually the service wasn't that bad, they did give us new plates during the meal, which is kind of a classy move.  The highlights included the lobster in ginger and scallions, peking duck, oysters in black bean sauce steamed on the half shell, and that fatty pork hot pot (the menu said "Pork Hock in red bean sauce" or something). The pork was stupendous, it literally melted in the mouth, the fat part that is.   Prices were very reasonable. We ran a tab of about $18 a person out the door with tax and tip, and we ordered the gourmet stuff, not the regular stuff.  The mall is nicely decked out with sumptuous tile floors, and it's kinda  a novelty to dine on upscale chine food inside a strip mall (the restaurant has no walls, just partitions to separate u from the mall).  The hood is a bit rough, so make sure you are taking advantage of the new concealed carry law, and pack some heat in the small of your back. Actually, a shoulder holster might be better, cuz your pants will get very tight after the huge meal.  Your Kong or Me Kong? MEKONG!

This place rocks! New, clean, modern, nice, cheap, free breakfast, comfy beds, view of vast desert wasteland in the west facing rooms...what more can you ask for?   (Oh yeah the toilets do clog easily, so take it easy when doing your thing)

This place is brand spanking new, serving up the culinary delights of Northeast China/Manchuria. The meat patty in fried pastry is absolutely to die for. They come 3 in an order and I saw people order it for lunch and wolf down all three in one sitting. The pastry is pan fried and the meat is somehow miraculously bathed in a savory soup. When you take a bite, the soup gushes out and overwhelms you, very much XLB style (Xiao Lung Bao).   The dumplings, pot stickers, and hand pulled noodle soups are also quite good, as well as the noodle in the dark thick peanutty sauce.   The ladies working there are pleasant and friendly. The restaurant is commendable for its cleanliness.  This place totally rocks and I recommend you all flash mob this place to keep it alive and well, serving up goodies for years to come.

The reviews are real. This place is fantastic...and CHEAP. The fish is nicely breaded and fried and the condiments are all-you-can-pile. I also had a chance to try the fish machaca and found it very pleasing to the taste buds. You can get two nicely sized tacos for $7. The free drink with yelp check-in is a LARGE. My only want is an option to have a flour tortilla instead. i love this place and will be back again!
