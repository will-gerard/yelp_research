One of my favorite restaurants. Service is not too bad on busy weekends, but it makes up for the excellent food they serve. The owner decided to put two teppanyaki grills and it wasn't a bad decision, at all. If you want to save a little money on the teppanyaki, go during lunch. Sushi (rolls, sashimi, nigiri) are always awesome.

One star? More like a "no star" rating for this establishment. My mother asked me to take her there one day since she loves buying things for herself and her grandchildren. Came in and immediately felt like it was the bakery "nazi," (I really apologize for using this term, but he seems to fit the profile). So my mother started give him her order and all the while sounded like a drill sergeant who hasn't had their morning coffee. He was very rude to my mother and I couldn't contain myself any longer and gave him a piece of my mind. I told my mother to forget it and leave, but she really wanted to bring some things for her grandchildren.   The man, apparently the owner, and phyllis from jim's burger and eggs, are a match made in heaven.   Anyway, this incident at this bakery happened a few years ago and decided to write this review just now because my wife saw this bakery doing some promos on "Surprise Matters."

We bought a couple of party trays for my birthday and I have to say, it can feed a whole battalion. Not only was there a lot of food, it was also delicious, as usual. Thank you, Greek Wraps!

We went there one Sunday noon with a party of 20. I have to say, with the short staff that they had that day, they performed admirably. This is the 3rd time we've been there and they never fail us. We ordered different kinds of entrees from Bun Cha, Com Dia, Pho, and multiple orders of Cha Gio and Goi Cuon. My brother-in-law ordered the house fried rice for two young boys with us, and of course the adults had to try it first (to make sure it was good... lol). And, indeed it was. The kids also ordered a bunch of fresh coconut and they enjoyed it very much. When you go to a Vietnamese restaurant, don't just settle for the Pho. Try other things. This is the place to do it.

Excellent experience. Had the French toast and eggs with side of 2 bacon slices. The service was great and the food came out quickly, the noise level at 10:00 a.m. was really good even though the restaurant was located on a fairly busy road and the prices are reasonable. The only thing that wasn't good was the coffee. Maybe make it just a little bit stronger or invest a few more on decent beans. Would come back and try other items on the menu.

Ever since we tried their pizza, we never ordered anywhere else. Never been to their establishment, we only order delivery. The "Monster" is just awesome, our personal favorite. Delivery is fast and friendly, too.

5 stars for the staff, the service, cleanliness and food. Been eating here since 2009 and the food only gets better. My fave is the chicken and prawns pad Thai, though I've tried different items on the menu and seems that everything I've tried was delicious.   Ate here two weeks ago and was slightly disappointed with the portion sizes. It seems to have become smaller. But, I stand by my 5  rating.

First time this place opened, it was disappointing. The food was good but each order of dinner entree were only enough for 2 people whereas other places like Good China and Big Buddha make theirs good for 3-4 people. Went there a couple of times and never came back. Until...  Recently, I have ordered off of their lunch menu. It didn't disappoint this time. My orders where the shrimp in lobster sauce, rock cod fillets with black bean sauce and orange flavored beef. I did that several times with different variations and I was satisfied. I also went ahead and ordered several dinner items, such as the salt and pepper  rock cod fillets and sesame chicken. No complaints.   I also have to agree with another "Yelper" who complained of not having a variety of vegetable entrees like bok choy.   Recommended.

I am giving them 5 stars because there is no other Chinese food here in Surprise that matches with them. We sometimes come in a big party (15-20) but had never waited for more than 15 minutes.  My personal favorite is the fish in black bean sauce. My son loves their orange beef. My wife loves the tofu and eggplant dish.  Never go to other Chinese restaurants in Surprise. This place is affordable, quiet, and the food is always good. It also helps that the service is excellent.

Can't beat the spaghetti and meatballs on Mondays and Tuesdays for $5.99. But, there are also several pasta dishes that are worth it; the 3 cheese mac and cheese is a favorite of my family and my own personal favorite is the creamy garlic chicken pasta dish. A great thing with Babbo, also, is that they will let you change the type of pasta for your pasta entree. Don't like penne, fine. Change it to linguine.   Their pizza is excellent, as well. You can not go wrong with any of their pizza.

Today was the fourth time we have eaten there. And seems as though that each time we go, the ratings go lower and lower. The first time we ate there, it was at lunch hour on a weekday. We sat at the sushi bar and the owner and sushi chef was there to serve us. I have to admit, the way he cuts his fish is bigger than all the sushi places I have been (that includes NV, CO, WA, NM, CA, HI, Okinawa, Korea, and other sushi places in AZ). He was friendly and told us to come back for their happy hour the next time we were in that area. So, for the first time we ate there, I would give it a 5 star rating. We went back a second time, this time for dinner at around 7 p.m. It was packed lightly and yet the service seemed slow. Sushi was good, soft shell crab was not cooked too well. And, to top it off, they ran out of the yellow tail collar. SO, okay, four stars for that meal. Third time was dinner again at around 6 p.m. Again, the service was slow, but the sushi was good. 3 star rating. Today, Saturday, we went before 5 p.m. to try the happy hour. Although there weren't many customers yet, the service again was slow. I told my family, if in two minutes (after waiting for 5 minutes) no one shows up to ask us for our drink order, we were leaving. Thank goodness somebody showed up. Then, we ordered our food: soft shell crab, tempura appetizer, crunchy roll, spicy tuna roll, yellow tail, albacore, salmon and tamago for our son. Once again, the soft shell crab was a big disappointment, the tempura was not good, but the sushi again was good. We get our check, and 10 minutes later, no one has picked up our payment so I got up and handed it to another server. Today, I give it a two star rating. It seems like the place is self destructing each and every time we eat there. Never again will we go back to Nakama. We went back there the second time because our first experience was great. We went there a third and fourth time so that we can confirm that that is one place we will never spend money on ever again.

I took my family here for my birthday two weeks ago. We were blown away with everything we ordered, especially the garlic white pizza.   Excellent food from excellent people.

Not the top place in the area, but certainly not the worst, either. I think this is the only place they have Japanese beer on tap. That right there is worth 4 stars, already. Servers are excellent: friendly, courteous and quick. We've been here at least 4 times. The first time we were there, we quickly learned to never order the sukiyaki. But, we greatly enjoyed their nigiri, sashimi and rolls. So, the other times we have been there to eat, we just stuck with the sushi menu and of course, Japanese draft beer. The service was always excellent, no complaints at all. Once we ordered a sushi boat and everything they gave us were very good. I would go back again.

Looking for Tae Kwon Do for your kids or for yourself? Master Choi and his instructors are very good in what they do and have no trouble sharing it with their students. If you want to get promoted fast and easy, this place is not for you. Master Choi promotes his students not because of the money you pay but the skills you learn. I have no regrets in enrolling my son at Master Choi's Traditional Tae Kwon Do Academy.

They will be having summer camp sign ups soon. Come and check them out. Loads of fun, excellent experience and certainly a place to meet new friends.

Okay, first of all, it's not hibachi. It's a teppanyaki grill. Secondly, do not go on Friday nights with your little kids or else you will expose them to drunks who yell and curse like they where at their houses. Overall, the food is not too bad. Especially the soft shell crab appetizer. I love the way they cook and serve it. It is so addicting. On weekdays, after 8:00 (maybe 9:00), they have a reverse happy hour on drinks and menu items. It's a pretty good deal. The service is good. Pua is our favorite server. As for our Teppanyaki grill master, I forgot his name, but he is good. He said he is from Manila of Chinese ancestry.

The problem with restaurants like this is when you have tried authentic Vietnamese food and there is a huge disparity in taste and quality. Sorry, but after trying their food twice, we will never come back again. It's a short drive to Pholicious or Old Glendale's Little Saigon, so we will just keep going to those two.

Yesterday, 5th of July 2014, was not the first time I've been to this establishment. Jim is a really nice guy and so are his staff. Well, except for one: his wife. Hence, the 2 stars.   I've been eating here since it opened and the food is always good, the people are always nice. Again, except for Phyllis. I could really call her another name but I won't.   It's really simple: if you do not like people in general, stop working the cash register and work the sink in the back washing dirty plates, cups and silverwares.   I like patronizing small business owners but her attitude is really getting ridiculous. Sorry, Jim. Never coming back ever.

Even if you hate the food, you got to love the people who work there. They are the friendliest of any burger places in Surprise. I have never been rushed with my orders and their suggestions help quite a bit, too. My son's favorite is the double bacon cheeseburger and mine is the single cheeseburger with mushrooms. If you are going to order fries for 2-3 people, order the regular sized one. It's more than enough. I love the food, I love the staff, and I love the ever confusing soda fountain. 5+++ stars!

4 Stars for now, because I have only eaten there once.   I had the chicken cordon bleu and chose the sweet potato fries and mushroom and corn risotto. My wife had half a rack of ribs with red beans and the risotto, as well. The sweet potato fries are very good. Very well cooked, crispy and lightly seasoned. My wife enjoyed her food, too.   I guess the main issue I have is the risotto. Although very tasty, it is not quite in the consistency of a risotto that I have typically eaten. They could maybe make it in a creamy consistency or change the name to mushroom and corn rice. This is not a complaint, merely a criticism.   As for the drinks, I had the Marley's Sweet tea, it's their own version of the Long Island Ice Tea. I enjoyed it very much because of the distinct whiskey taste. I love whiskey. My wife had their version of the Mai Tai called, "The 1944,"  paying tribute to the original Trader Vic's Mai Tai version of 1944. She liked it very much.   Our server, Sean, was quite a pleasant fellow. Very proper and attentive. I should have given them a 5 star rating for Sean alone.   The owners (mom, daughter and son), were present tonight and we saw them working around making sure to give a helping hand to their staff.   Oh, and the cornbread was also good.  They also have a bar and their happy hour is from 3-6 p.m. I think they should add another hour to it. Their TV sets are situated very well.

I have taken my wife there for Sunday brunch and other family members another Sunday, also for brunch. I enjoyed the omelette  bar very much, the chef is a friendly man always smiling even when it's busy. As usual, Sean was tremendous, as well as John, the other server. When John was busy, Sean helps out and vice versa even if it's not their table. Really great people there. I also enjoyed the thin slices of sausage patties with biscuit and gravy. The price is excellent for $9.99.

The first time I tried WBC, it was at the Sedona Branch. The Arrowhead branch did not disappoint, either. The staff were as friendly as the Sedona branch. Of course, the food was delicious and the store was very clean.   Will keep coming back.

5 stars for the friendliness and politeness of the staff. Their product in not bad at all, either. I had the double choc mocha and it was very good.   Will be back here everyday.
