The helpful "geniuses" at this Apple store not only replaced my battery but also partitioned my hard drive and fixed a glitch on the hard drive to do so. And they expedited the process so I could get home in time to feed my dog. I was surprised and pleased by the expedient, expert assistance I received.

I always have a great experience here, and they treat both my mild-mannered labrador and my highly excitable cat like royalty. I've seen four of the doctors and all of them were expedient and good to deal with. If your animal tends to need the vet often (as my dog does), the annual plan turns out to be a big value. I can bring my dog in anytime for anything, and the appointment is free. Which means I don't have to wait to see if something is a real problem (by which point it will be more expensive) to get it checked out. They have convenient appointments. The one down side is that they have so much business. You sometimes need to wait on the phone or in line when you arrive.

I've rarely encountered a hotel I wouldn't stay at again and wouldn't recommend to others. Until I stayed at Mandalay. Several in my large group, myself included, had to ask to be moved due to cleaning issues in their rooms. Which was crazy considering the rooms were gorgeously designed and appointed: plush, spacious bedrooms; roomy bathrooms with both a bath and shower, not to mention a double-sink plus a door to the toilet. The rooms could have been shared comfortably and partied in pragmatically, no doubt. While I will give management credit for satisfactorily resolving our issues, the fact we encountered them at all for the rate we were paying was ridiculous. Then there were the amenities. The gym was small for the rate and the pool opened way late in the morning and closed too early at night. I know they want to keep patrons gambling at all hours, but I know (from the line of 50 people at opening time) that I'm not the only one who'd rather drop my cash on cocktails poolside and I didn't like the feeling I was being controlled. Did I mention the fake beach and plethora of kids? Then, after my stay, I discovered they billed me for both my room and a colleague's by mistake. And there was nothing to do in walking distance. Which makes this one I'll bypass next time around.

Excellent Indian food restaurant with a mostly vegan menu and a few vegetarian options.   The cauliflower is not to be missed and is a reason to dine here in itself.   The decor and location could be better, but the high-quality lunch buffet makes this a perfect anytime choice for a  local Indian or vegetarian meal.

I'm giving this four stars for the quality compared to the price. I was not sure what to expect since it was priced lower than the other city center hotels, but it turned out to be perfectly fine. Not luxurious, but for a professional, it did the trick and it was clean and aesthetically pleasing. The front-desk staff was friendly and helpful. They'd made an effort to make the hotel modern and fun. And best of all, the location was perfect. Close and walking distance to everything, including some of the pricier conference hotels just a few blocks away. Restaurants and shopping and tourist attractions were all convenient. I would come back if I visit Montreal again.

When you come here, you feel like you still matter as a patient. When I come here, it's evident Dale Ann Dorsey truly cares about my health as a woman, in all dimensions, and goes out of her way to get me the best care possible. She has convenient after-work hours as well.

Pomegranate Cafe is popular-and for good reason. The all-vegan cafe with a few egg and dairy options for less-strict vegetarians had a line out the door, with 10 people ahead of me, when I arrived for Sunday brunch. And that line didn't decrease over the entire hour I was there.  It might be the reputation the suburban success in Ahwatukee, Ariz., has garnered as one of the very rare restaurants that serves a vegan brunch every day of the week. Or, it could just be the spectacular food. (I saw at least one culinary institute coat and I can assure you, these people know how to cook.)  Be forewarned: Dishes here are too numerous to choose from. You'll be compelled, more likely compulsed, to come back.  My dining companion and I had the In Season Scramble-hers with dairy and eggs, mine without.  Both were delicious and accompanied by "harvest hash" (a surprisingly balanced medley of potatoes, sweet potatoes, kale, peppers and other veggies) plus toast and homemade jam.  I consider this simply an introduction to the restaurant, which boasts a tantalizing array of vegan desserts (make no mistake: The baked-goods counter is food porn at its best-resistance is futile), not to mention smoothies, raw dishes and lunch offerings that would have any foodie's palate irrevocably aroused.  I'm coming back for the Raw! Lasagne, "Today's Burger" (I had plate envy of the diners next to me), Wild Western Tacos and mmm, mmm, mmm, like everything in the dessert counter. (Please, chocolate cake, be there upon my return). If you live within 25 miles of this place, it's worth a trip simply as a dining destination.  To view the menu in depth (warning: not for the faint of willpower!), visit http://www.pomegranatecafe.com/pdfs/menu-2012-fall.pdf.

I was delighted to find this gem, located near downtown Phoenix. I personally had a good dining experience and an attentive server both times I dined here, and I enjoyed the flavors. Most important, the ambience makes this a good stop for a casual or friendly business lunch in the area. They also had some tasty healthy options. This will definitely become one of my go-tos.

The Westin Downtown is fantastic. My room was enormous and the Heavenly Beds were just that. There was both a couch and a desk so I could get comfortable or work or get comfortable and work. Three spacious closets actually included drawers and hid away things like the safe, coffee setup, etc. The bathroom was twice the size of a typical hotel bathroom, with a glass-walled shower and lots of counter space, not to mention the plush bathrobe. The television featured a wide variety of entertainment options, and they had provided two real (as in caffeinated) coffee packets and to-go cups. I wish I could have moved in. The workout center was smaller than I expected, but I had no competition for a treadmill and it was open 24 hours. The bar offered an excellent selection of local beers, light, dark and in between. I would have liked a few less chi-chi food options on the menu, though. Staff granted my request for an early check-in and a room on the floor I wanted. Another guest commented on the complimentary bottle of water and the second bottle for the almost laughable price of $1. The only few minor foibles were the phone--I couldn't figure out how to work it, and it wasn't labeled with an easy way to contact the front desk. Also, the body lotion was opened upon closer inspection. I really believe that any hotel stay should come with free Wi-Fi nowadays but they had made a nice effort to have a tiered pricing system. All in all, a great place to stay and close to many of the visitor draws in downtown Phoenix.

This was the best experience I have ever had at a salon, and I am extremely picky. I want a lot from my stylist--I consider this a long-term relationship--and I was devastated when my former stylist (the creative director at another salon) retired. Who could possibly live up to her standards? The receptionist here was patient in helping me find a stylist who might possibly meet my expectations, and Delores surpassed every one of them. Not only was she a personality fit (very important to me) but she did what I asked, engendering trust immediately, AND seriously, improved upon the cut I had had for years. Today I received truly the best haircut I have had in five years--exactly what I wanted but beyond what I asked for--along with helpful recommendations on how to emulate it on my own. I cannot wait to go back. I am also really impressed, because the price was HALF what I was accustomed to paying and although I loved the way I was treated by my former person, I have never left the styling chair as satisfied. Making the experience even better is the fact this salon is not only open nights, but also Saturday AND Sunday. So I will not have to take vacation hours to get a haircut.

A great and convenient stop when you're craving vegan comfort food. This location is much better appointed and more comfortable to dine in than the Tempe location. However, they could use some additional parking. Also, I could swear the meal portions (specifically the noodle dishes) have gotten smaller, especially for takeout.

You're probably sensing a theme in my posts--that is, where can I eat locally and healthfully but also conveniently on the go? I'm finding some surprising options, including a new food truck, The Uprooted Kitchen, which can be found at Food Truck Fridays in Phoenix, among other locations in metro Phoenix throughout the week.  While the truck is advertised as merely vegetarian, I was happily surprised to find that all options were, or could be made, vegan.  Choosing between two tempting salads, a cheesy wrap and the veg burger was quite difficult, but in the end, I gave in to my craving for something crisp and went with the cheesy wrap, made with tapioca-based daiya cheese substitute. (Mozzarella was also an option.)  The "cheesy" wrap was a guilt-free comfort food. While it felt filling and indulgent, the crisp wrap was stuffed with a wholesome medley of black beans, cauliflower, pureed butternut squash, corn, tomatoes and just a sprinkle of daiya. The decadent but light concoction was sided with a spicy but not heavy salsa plus greens and parslane.  I will definitely be back to sample the other options on this menu.

I have been going to Leah for eight years now. She does high-quality, consistent work in shaping my brows. Best of all, she is an exceptional listener and always strives to give me the shape I like. She is also really affordable and accommodating to her clients.

If you love craft beer, this should be your go-to or a night out when visiting downtown phoenix. The ever-revolving selection of beers on tap and available beer flights make beer-tasting an adventure. If I had one complaint, it's the difficulty of finding seating for a group every time I've ever visited, even after calling ahead. This is a great problem to have, but it's a solvable problem.

I was really looking forward to trying out the Vig, now that it had taken over a much-needed restaurant/bar spot that serves the area where I work. I'm sorry to say that while I'm sure it would be a great place to relax on the patio with a cocktail, I was vastly disappointed with the food. I came with a large group for a simple birthday lunch. We were crowded together at a too-small table, despite having made a reservation. The service was unbelievably slow. The vegetarian options on the menu were limited. However, when I asked them to make my dish with tofu instead (which you would think screams vegetarian preference), it still came out with shrimp and an egg. We had waited so long for the food that I let it go and simply shared the shrimp and suffered the egg, but I definitely wouldn't come here for food in the future.
