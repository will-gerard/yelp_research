This is a great Hispanic grocery store. Many options available that you are not going to be able to find at a place like Safeway. I also think it's a great benefit that my auto insurance company has an office here as well. I recommend their juice bar. The platano juice is a must! When they have it! The only improvement I can see them making is providing bicycle racks at there location. As a safe place to park one's bike as it adds to a safer, cleaner, and friendly downtown Phoenix! Cheers!

Overall the school is a fine school. They are working to make the student experience a better one. However, there are some MAJOR improvements needed in the cafeteria. So this review goes to the cafeteria. Their procedures are backwards and demoralizing. I have seen twice now to staff members being shut down for going the extra mile. The first time I asked to have some olives on my sandwich, which it was made clear that THOSE were from the SALAD bar and were NOT cut. The other staff member felt sympathy when both of them realized how ridiculous it was over olives and offered to cut me up some. She was told that she can't do that because she doesn't have her cutting certificate. I understand the legality of the whole thing so the school should have her get one! Or better yet have the culinary school certify her!   The next bit that I have a problem with is when I was waiting at a cashier booth to pay my food and no one was there, someone on break began to take care of me when  she was then was reprimanded in front of me that she shouldn't do that. Well! Maybe the cashier should have been there! Why the heck would you reprimand someone for going the extra mile! I would mention the person's name who went the extra mile but in this backwards cafeteria I would be afraid she would get in trouble! PLEASE make it so that the customer feels welcome and not intruding on a political court. I don't want to feel like I have to be a lawyer in order to purchase some food. Besides that, everyone is friendly and helpful. It's the procedures that are problematic. Hopefully the school will be implement procedures that accommodate the customer and reflect the real world.

some of the staff is wonderful. on the other hand some of them aren't. i am tired of not being able to smile and look at my server in the eye and say "hello". apparently that is not ok to do with some of the staff. particularly the big dude with the pony tail. i am a pretty forgiving person and i understand we all have our bad days...but after the fourth time serving me, do you still have to be rude? one time i asked what kind of teas they have and i get the look-at-the-ceiling-rolled-eyes  and he points and says "there they are." ...a few different containers of teas with labels on them which i can't read. another issue i have is that it is not always 'customer first.' if i'm standing around and don't know where to order, with a bunch of people and they don't know where to order either, help us figure it out....we are the ones ultimately PAYING your PAYCHECK. another issue is the bipolarness of some of the staff, one day the blonde chick is nice, the next she's rude. why would you be rude? i'm paying for my drink, i'm giving YOU YOUR PAYCHECK money. this is a problem that many coffee shops have, a rude staff. however, the rest of the staff is quite nice and awesome:) and really friendly. really there's only two bad eggs. if they would only be nice 95% of the time instead of 10% i would be much happier. again i am a very forgiving person so i hope that they read this and shape up.
