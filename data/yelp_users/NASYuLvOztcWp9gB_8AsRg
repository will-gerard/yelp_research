Love this place. Food is always good. Love the spinach dip and the pizza. Great service. I usually sit at the bar. I like the patio area as well. Definitely try this place! Kyla is the best server.  Ask for her and you won't be disappointed.

Terrible service and even worse food. I can't understand why people like to come here. Beer is expensive. Save your money and try something else.

One of my favorite spots.  The mango tango margarita is the bomb!  I usually sit at the bar because Joe gives the best service.  The short rib taco is also amazing.  Definitely try this place.

First time here.  Sat at the bar.  Charlie was extremely friendly and helpful.  I had a Greek salad and it was the best one I've ever had.  I will be back!

This is my new favorite breakfast spot.  The oj is fresh and delicious.  The red velvet pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever eaten.   Everything I've had here is amazing. Service is great,  especially veronice.  She's the best!
