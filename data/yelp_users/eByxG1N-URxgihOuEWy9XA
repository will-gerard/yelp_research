I thought the fried rice was good until I got a mouth full of eggshells. Really disappointed. I've never had that happen before. How do you get a whole broken up eggshell in your rice. Ridiculous.

Absolutely one of the best doctors I've ever been to. He's one of my favorite. Blanca at the front desk is a crack up and is always so sweet and attentive. Dr glassman is always looking out for your best interest and makes you feel confortable with his upbeat energy and humour. I can't say anything but wonderful things about this office.

I came here on my lunch break and the way they have the drive through set up to pull into is chaotic. Ordered my food and the lady outside taking my order had an attitude and was very rude. I understand you want to keep fastest drive through in Arizona title but if that means you're going to mess up my order and give me the wrong food then it is not worth it. They couldn't even bother to put utensils in my bag for my fruit cup. I don't usually leave a review but I expect more from chick fil a.
