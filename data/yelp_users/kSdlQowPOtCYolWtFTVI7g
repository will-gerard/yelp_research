Oh my, the sweet potato fries, dry wings & kiwi strawberry green tea are to die for! And the staff is always extremely friendly. This is one of my favorite places in Old Town.

This is our new favorite place in Scottsdale!  The food was phenomenal, the service was great and the ambience was charming with great live music.    Nick took wonderful care of us from the moment I called to make the reservation.  He personally chose a selection of tapas and paella for our group of 6 based on the things we told him we liked and not a single dish disappointed!  Favorites include the lamb chops, the filet skewers, cheese-stuffed portobellos and bacon/cheese empenadas.  The seafood paella was also incredible!  I also highly recommend the sangria, both the traditional and the white.  Nick comped all the birthday boy's drinks which was a very thoughtful gesture and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine selection.  We were there for dinner, but we will definitely be back again soon for happy hour... 3-6pm every day and the entire menu and sangria are 50% off!  In a town where new, overly-hyped restaurants come and go on the regular, we were very pleasantly surprised with Tapas Papa Frita and can't wait to go back.

Allegiant doesn't even deserve the 1 star I'm giving them in order to write this review.  I have never received such poor customer service in my life!    We were lured in by their low prices, but, after all the add-ons, it was really no less than what we could have spent with Southwest.  Our flight was supposed to depart for Vegas at 5pm (a 45 minute flight, keep in mind), however we were ultimately delayed for FOUR hours.  We weren't provided with any update until 45 minutes AFTER our flight was supposed to take off.  Instead, all staff l vacated the terminal (yes, they literally all left), so there was no one to even talk to. When an announcement was finally made at 5:45pm, it was an announcement over the loudspeaker (still no staff in sight) to say that our flight was going to depart at 6pm, which we all knew was obviously just a statement to placate us as there was still no plane at the gate and we would literally have had to be boarded already to depart a mere 15 minutes later.   I could go on and on about how awful the experience was (no refunds, no credits, no apologies, not even a free drink... they wanted to charge $2 just for water on the plane.  Isn't water usually free??), but it's obvious that I'm not the only one that has had such a horrible experience with Allegiant and I don't need to belabor the point.  Needless to say, I will never fly them again and have made it my mission to warn other consumers.  DO NOT FLY ALLEGIANT.
