If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Want there on Veterans Day for my fathers birthday. There was a group of about 15 of us in the bar. Only 4 tables in the dinning room with 3 servers and a manager. It took us 20 minutes to even get a drink order for me my mother my boyfriend and 20 month old son. At that point she was already trying to get a food order from us, are you kidding me?! Got our order in and being a waitress I always ask tables with. Kids if they want the kid food to come out first. Not only did she not ask, his come out last!  Mom got the brisket. I don't know why they even bothered to bring it out. You could see the fat just sitting on top. Got the salmon which was ok, but it was supposed to come with two sides but only got one. When I asked about it they aid they would get it. Maybe 5 minutes later got my Mac and cheese side. Lukewarm at best and the cheese on top wasn't even melted. My boyfriend never got one refill on his soda, even when he put it to the end of the table.   Needless to say it was a HORRIBLE experience and I will never be going back!

Fantasgic place to eat! Me and my boyfriend come go vegas at least once a year and wd come here at least once a trip. Tried the pan fried dumpligs this trip and they were amazing. And the sauce they give u is sweet and a bit tangy and delicious.   Sometimes there is a wait but it's worth it. They are pretty fast at seatingand even when its packed they get the food out fast.  definently a must in vegas

Food is good and staff is friendly, including who I assume is the owner. Lots of tvs and they prioritize Cardinals games. My only problem is that sometimes if its really busy the staff gets backed up. Overall a great place to watch the game.

Io have been here3 times now and will continue to go back! I go in with my 20 month old son and they always give me the warmest welcome. Clean bathrooms and clean dining room every time I go in. Usually get the eggs Benedict and the holendaise sauce is super flavorful. Bacon iOS more crispy than I prefer but love that they offer a bacon flight. The apple cider bacon is my favorite. Being in the area my whole life, I have seen many places come and go from this location, I'm hoping this sticks around for a long time.

Went in for dinner a couple weeks ago with my mother and infant son. They got me seated right away, with a high chair in tow! Everyone was very accommodating, especially considering my son. Most servers scoff at having children but our server was wonderful with him!  me and my mother split the house salad and she had the pasta with eggplant, and i had the shell pasta with ham. All dishes were delicious and full of favor. Wine was very reasonably priced as well.   For being a busy night the place seemed really calm. Love this place and can't wait to come back for more!

Is there something I am not seeing in this place? Went there this evening with my dad not knowing that that it changed from chuys. Was not impressed at all. Sat down at a high top and a nice gentleman came up to us to explain everything but unfortunately could not understand a word he said except to deduct that we were to go to the bar to order. Place looked clean enough. Got the food, cheese enchiladas they were ok but nothing to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor and did not realize it is served on styrophome plates and plastic utensils. Not my kind of place, and I am not too fussy on where I eat, if I want a lower rate Mexican place I would rather go to Carolina's right down the way.
