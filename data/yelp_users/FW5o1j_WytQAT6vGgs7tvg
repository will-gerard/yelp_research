This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...

Bret Branch  is awesome! I struggled with our R.O. drinking water system, it was outdated, (had zero labels), dirty and had little pressure. They hooked us up with fresh clean water, very affordable, hassle free, they did what they said, and "wow", they were there when they said they were!

I'm a regular at this food shop, It seems every time we go we just want to keep coming back, the food is fresh, delicious, the place is clean, staff is friendly, and service good, and they fill your wine glass to the brim to boot!

Whenever I'm on 7th I try and stop in here... Aside from an awkwardly hinged restroom door facing the dining area (the facilities however are sparkling clean), you won't be disappointed. So far I have had 4 of their samiches, and dig them all! Fresh ingredients, hip music, neighborhood style building, local beverage, small menu, fantastic!

Burrito, after a few bites I discovered I had been chewing on a piece of what appeared to be plastic like cigarette clear wrapping the size of a playing card, the food is always cold, between the food being cold every time I get a burrito there and now foreign objects in the burrito! Come on, its Arizona, there's plenty of better places to get your burrito fix...

The menu is great, the same as N. Mesa location, decore and site is great however service is lousy every time we go, napkins are too cheap and small as well. The manager seems to have dinner with his family right out in the bar when they are slammed... Most of the staff seem to be inexperienced high school kids... we have since stopped going because of this even though we live less than a mile away. Seems like a training and hiring issue...

Call Debbie! Hands down the best move I did for my credit situation. You will walk away feeling confident, directed, and focused, with  a real affirmative plan of action. Debbie gives you all of that and more... My credit score is making its way up the charts in a short amount of time if you just follow her direction...

After apx. 43 visits to Postino East, I believe I have a handle on their menu and wine list, but... I sure wish there was an app for the Poblano Corn Soup! Its to die for, can I get a bucket of that to go?

I first called upon a friend of a friends AC company (Bad Decision) they sent a tech out and billed me $95 for "No Issues Discovered, Runs Normal" however this was not the case. My AC would cycle on and off every 15 seconds and then again at 30 seconds, the tech said that was normal. I thought I was going mad, like the Edgar Allen Poe Book with the guy killing himself due to the scratching in the wall. But after looking through Yelp I saw 75 reviews of Dukes and all good, hey can't go wrong there right. Exactly! They were prompt to return my call on a Saturday morning, they sent Dustin out that same afternoon, he diagnosed the problem "a defrost circuit board". They ordered the part and came back out on Monday as planned and walla! All Fixed. They are familiar with Trane and have all of the right tools not just a set of gauges to test for a temperature spread. Pricing was spot-on-good too. After he was all done he even blew his loud Duke's of Air Horn from the van! Can we upload audio Yelp?

I love Yelp, I searched for "tree trimming" and discovered Treewise, I called at 3:30 ish and Howard answered, he was prompt and sounded busy with appointments however showed up at my house @ 4:30 an hour later, we discussed the several trees that needed attention, he was back at my house the next morning and did a fantastic job! Now we even know what kind of trees we have, 1 is a greek mastic that I had no idea the historic values of and even using the sap for chewing gum! I know right... Good luck to Treewise, Howard and his little family, may your business keep growing...

The grand opening of Riverview Park was excellent. More to come as hotels and shops are planned. Super open, clean, and better than before. The stadium is huge!

Fox Restaurants is part of my portfolio of good eats, however Culinary Dropout in Tempe is not 1 of them. First off; the make up air system for the exhaust grease hoods is waaayyy off, when you enter the building you experience the "wiff" of a back alley Japanese teppanyaki grease fryer-smoke sensation, I had to drop off my clothes at the dry cleaners the next morning to rid this odor. If your not familiar with make up air its the air that is pumped in from the roof to provide the exhaust grease hood to make up for the air its exhausting, sometimes too close to an HVAC unit on the roof it gets pumped in for the patrons to breathe and smell. Second; the layout feels like a junior high school cafeteria with tables lined up in parallel, with all the "cool kids" having fun tossing bags of beans back and forth in the adjoining Yard. Third; our server was pleasant, speedy, but lacked a smile, maybe had a bad day who knows? Fourth; we ordered the "36 hour pork ribs", mistake, they were cold, apx. room temperature or just below, I felt like a cave man chewing the hard to separate meat off the bone, after which we asked where the restrooms were so we could wash our hands from all of the bbq sauce, our server pointed the way down a dreary hallway, why don't they provide a wet nap at minimum, for the $25 plate they should provide a hot towel!   Culinary Dropout is a great matching name for the restaurant, I think every one staffed there may just be Drop Outs...

This neighborhood has been dying for fresh good open modern food, wine, and friendliness! Modern Grove provides it! Hands down yummy goodness! Misty and Erik the bartender's rock-it and is are structural gears; pizza oven needs some work on completeness of dough cookness, great prices, clean, open, expect complaints from the LDS community cuz its in it and its not Mexican, this place is a sneak peek at what "Mesa Should Have!"
