I got two mix drinks midori sour and gin tonic there and told the bartender to close my tab. So my tab came and the total was 31.50! The bartender was really really rude the whole time and kept yelling at me. And even used the "f" word just because I told her the price was ridiculous high. Anyways it ended up I refuse to pay the bill and my boyfriend paid In cash with 0 cent tip. And the girl just tole me "I already void your credit card charge" and would NOT gave me a receipt that proves it.  That was my first time there and I was super upset. I had such a terrible night after that happened. And I told all my friends that I'll NEVER ever go back to that place and get yelled by a striper all night.

So here I am. I really should've read the reviews on yelp before I purchased my groupon from this place.  Anyway, I bought a groupon offer for xray,exam&regular cleaning combo for this dentistry. Reason? For my regular half an year check up & cleaning. Plus I don't have insurance so that's the only reason this time I went for a groupon. Ok let's start the story. I went there this morning, waited 25 mins then had a x-Ray taken by a young girl, then a doctor came and told me I had some kinda gum disease and 5 cavities. I was very shocked cuz I do go to my dentist every half a year. And actually a little over 7 months ago I even got my regular teeth cleaning & whitening done. My dentist told me Last time all l need to do is do a lily take more flossing, other than that my teeth were looking good! Half a year later, my teeth really got some kind of serious problem and gum diseases? Ok.. Another 30 mins later this young girl finally came back with an estimate for $1724 for my "deep cleaning" for next two visits. And also a credit plan. I remember when I had my gum bleeding a few years ago I had to get a deep cleaning and it was less than $600 at a dentistry in Chandler. So I told her it's ok I'll just do my regular cleaning. Ok put back in the waiting area again. 15 mins later, told me I'm free to go. Really? I asked what about my cleaning? I paid the offer on groupon. She said they can't do a regular cleaning for me because I need a deep cleaning. I have the estimate and it's optional. I repeated one more time that I paid the offer and it does include the regular cleaning. Ok now she says " you have to talk to groupon then, we don't promise to clean your teeth when your teeth need something more. I have other patients and I don't have time.."  Wow of course I walked away, being very angry. Paid the money for cleaning and got nothing except all this BS. And wasted over 2 hours of just sitting there. How would you feel? This is absolutely CRAZY! And I would just say DO NOT GO THERE!

Just reading my old reviews on Yelp n saw my old one at this place. It still made me really angry. The truth is after went to this place I went back to my dentist for my regular cleaning n X-ray. And they showed me again my teeth were very healthy! So people who're trying to go to place just prepare at least $1700 for their bullshit and don't buy any deals on groupon. Cuz they won't even give you the cleaning unless you pay $1700 for nothing!

This is just an awesome place. My boyfriend and I went there and had a bottle wine. Some artichoke and lamb flatbread for appetizer. I had sea scallops and he had some wood fired pork. All o them were very well prepared and tasted delicious.  Our waiter was really professional and nice  There was also a lady playing piano and that was defiantly my favorite part. Somehow she played all my favorite music and I was in love with her voice! Bill comes out around 100 and we had a $25 off American express discount card. It's a little pricy but I think it totally worth it.  I will definitely come back to this place for their dessert and wine and music again!! I do love Season 52.

Food is good price and they look good. But if you don't order a drink from them they charge you 25cents for a small water cup. Lol

I am a regular here and I love this place. I usually come with a other person so we get $55 for two for an hour. People are all very nice here and I like how they actually press hard on your body. You know the real Asian massage is all about the pressure points.  You'll be satisfied too ;)
