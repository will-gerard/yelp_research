First time tonight! WOW! Amazing food, atmosphere and they LOVE dogs! Pet Friendly. Awesome service. The owner brought out different sausages for my dog. The Chocolate Martini's were D'Lish and my husband LOVED his beer German Hef. We will for sure be back, our food was so yummy...from the appetizer brie to brats and my pork dish, wow. You won't be disappointed.

Tonight we ate dinner at Fogo De Chao in Scottsdale. My husbands & our kids first experience. My family was beyond impressed.  From Caiprihana's to beer to wine, it was excellent service. The unlimited food was amazing and top notch. The filet mignon, the best I have ever tasted! It is 5 star, all the way. For every table you have about 8-10 waiters and you are attended to at all times. All I can say is ease up on that salad bar, the second course is what you pay for. Amazing!

Last week, my dog ingested a bone from a pork chop. I went to ER late at night, 9:30 pm...Dr on call told me he could see bone lodged in my dogs esophagus. Many X-rays  sent to Radiologist to confirm it. I have a dachshund/chihuahua...7 years old. Love of my life. He told me he needed to have it removed immediately. I opted out. Mainly because the cost was so high and I was so uncertain and was just hoping the bone would pass, but by 7 am, my dog was foaming at the mouth. I knew I had to take him back. As I went back, I met Dr Stephen Gilson. He was thorough and patient , as  I was a mess! A few hours later, maybe 2 hours, he completed the procedure. No incision, he took a scope down the throat, saw the lodged bone ( BIG BONE) and brought it up through the mouth. I can't thank him enough.....His demeanor and confidence was just what I needed! I would say the staff was so kind, just if you go late at night, seems like it goes way slower. Other than that, I give this practice a 5 star! My dogs back to normal and so thankful!

You have the rudest, impatient male employee in your store.( late teens or early 20's) I will not be back. When your employee was so impatient and rude to me, laughing, your other two lady employees didn't even acknowledge he was a jerk to a customer. I will spread the word to my friends not to go to this Subway. Worst service ever.  May 14, 2015 around 11:30 am.
