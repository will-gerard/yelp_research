One of my all time favorite places to meet up with friends.  I have been coming to Baby Kay's for several years now.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating.  The inside of the restaurant has an area for families or those with larger groups, a bar area in the back and an outside sitting area.    I don't like seafood, but their menu has a large enough variety of non-seafood items for me to choose from.  I have tried just about every non-seafood item they have to offer too.  My favorite entrees are the Pork Chop special with dirty rice and fettuccine with cream sauce and chicken.  And I must always get the Spinach and Artichoke appetizer as well.    As mentioned before, this is a New Orleans Cajun style restaurant, so be prepared for a little bit of spiciness.

My husband and I have been coming here for the past 4 years.  The food and service has always been great.  My husband enjoys the beef tacos and fajitas.  I enjoy the chicken chimichanga and pollo diablo. And we must get a frozen margarita to go with our food = yummy.  We love the food here so much, we visit at least 3 times a month.    Melissa, our typically assigned waitress (she is always there) knows what we like.  And even when it gets busy, she always makes time to chat with us.  Love her!!   Prices are awesome, food is delicious and service has always been good to us.  I highly recommend this place.

4 out of 5 stars only because the cafe is small and the floors were dirty.   Other than that, the service and food was great. I had the Eggs Benedict and my husband had the corned beef hash. (Seems to be a breakfast trend of ours as of late). The Benedict sauce was delicious, I was even dipping the potatoes in it.   Plenty of food at a good price. I look forward to coming back and trying a different item on the menu.

Great job! 1st time customer. I called to get a quote and they also had an opening the same day. Our technician even showed up a little early.   After watching friend and family puppies the past couple of months and then adding a new puppy to our family, our carpets were dirty. Pet stains and regular traffic dirt was disgustingly apparent. I wasn't sure some of the stains could be lifted. After the cleaning, our carpets looked new. No more dirt or pet stains to be seen.   Randy was our cleaning technician and he was courteous and knowledgeable. He didn't try to up-sell me at all. That was a relief.  Pricing was fair and totally worth it.   I will definitely use F&F Carpet Cleaning again.

The BEST! I considers myself a picky eater. Every item I've eaten at Julio's, the food has tasted wonderful. The service is top notch and the prices are great. If you're looking for good Mexican food and margaritas check out Julio's.

Been here three times in the past six months and not one complaint on food, service or atmosphere.  The Avocado Chicken Club is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had.  I'm not a big seafood fan, but I'll eat their California Roll.

Five Stars Yet Again!!  I held my daughter's sweet sixteen birthday party here (this is her favorite place to eat).  I reserved part of the back patio (North end).  Prior to the event, I was a bit nervous because I wasn't sure what to expect for a party of 20 kids and 7 adults.  I've only come to Kona for lunch with a couple other people.  Both Zach (mgr) and Michael (gm) were helpful and prompt in answering all my questions.    On the evening of the event, Zach made sure our party had enough "private" space as possible from other patrons on the patio.  We had two waitresses assigned to us full time and the food was plentiful for all.  And super delicious!!  We chose the buffet style, so the kids had a variety.  There was a live band that night and the singer was kind enough to take song requests and sing Happy Birthday to my daughter.  The kids had such a good time eating and mingling that I had a difficult time getting them to leave when the party was over.   Overall, I was more than pleased with the experience and most of all my daughter was happy.  A special thank you to Zach for all that he did to make this a special birthday my daughter will never forget.

First time here and I am not impressed.  I had made an appt. for my girlfriend and I to get mani/pedis done on a Monday at noon.  I intentionally made the appointment for us both, so we could visit.  Danny did my pedicure and Amy did my gel manicure.  Danny did a good job on my pedicure and the bonus neck rub was nice.  After the pedicure, he then set me up at his station to do my gel manicure and next to my girlfriend.  Then approx. 5 minutes later left and another lady (come to find out was Amy) was telling me to move to her station, which was sitting away from my girlfriend.  Looking confused, the receptionist said she had made a mistake and scheduled someone else to get a manicure with Danny.  I didn't request Danny myself nor did I care as long as I could sit next to my girlfriend and we could carry on our conversation.  Amy looked upset when I questioned whether or not she could do my nails where I was currently sitting and she said no.  Without argument, I moved to Amy's station and she seemed upset the entire time doing my manicure, rushed the process and didn't bother with a complimentary neck massage as everyone else, including my girlfriend received by their technicians.    Now that I'm home and closely examining my nails, I notice flaws in the gel.  My thumb nail has a bubble underneath the gel and it looks distorted.  One pinky nail has a dent in it.  Probably from Amy rushing me to put my hand in the uv lamp and a few times picking my hand up herself and putting it in the uv lamp as if I didn't know how or did it quick enough for her. All she had to do is ask.    There are multiple nail salons near me and worth receiving my money.  I see no need to go back to Biagio off 16th Street again.

Came to Babbo today with my girlfriend for a lunch date.  I have never been, but have heard good things about the place.  They do offer lunch specials, but I craved something a little different than what they had on their lunch menu and ordered the 'Creamy Garlic Chicken Pasta'.  Instant hit!  The sauce was delicious, the penne pasta cooked perfectly and there was an abundance of chicken.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dish.    Babbo is approximately a 20 minute drive from where I live and it is worth it.  I look forward to trying their other dishes.

Been here a few times over the past 3 years and I have yet to have a bad experience. The staff has always been courteous, prices are decent and the atmosphere is inviting.   My favorite time is happy hour. The Vig has a nice variety of food and beverages on their happy hour menu. You can enjoy sitting inside or out in the covered yard area. I prefer the yard area because it is more open.   I would give the Vig 5 stars if it weren't for the lack of parking spaces and need to use their valet service. I like to have the option.

Ladies happy hour on Thursday. We arrived at the Garage around 5:30 and it was mostly empty. Bonus for us, because the 7 of us could get a table quickly.  As the evening went on, the place filled up.  Tony was our server and he was polite and attentive. Always had a smile.  Atmosphere was fun and inviting. The layout is set up to where you don't feel like you're on top of each other. Bathrooms were very clean. Patrons ranged in age from late 20's to early 40's.   As for food, my friend and I shared the deviled eggs, Parmesan fries from the happy hour menu and chicken BBQ flat bread from the regular menu. Our food came out quick and tasted great. And based on the clean plates from the others and not one complaint, they enjoyed their food too.  There was a good variety of beverages on the Happy Hour menu, which kept us happy and our tab low.  Overall, the seven of us enjoyed our Happy Hour experience at Garage Wine and Tap. And we'll definitely be back in the near future.

I went in on New Years Eve.  Walked in with my flat tire, the associate came around the corner and took it, repaired it in less then two minutes and I was on my way.  Associate was hospitable and quick.  Just the way I like it.    FYI: I couldn't help but notice that they had a large selection of bikes too.  When I'm due for a new bike, I'll be sure to check this place out again.

I've been a member at CoreBalance Studio since November 2013 and plan on continuing as long as their doors are open.  This is a two-room fitness studio that offers Yoga, Spin, Barre and Weightless classes.   I've had your standard gym memberships in the past and never felt like I was working out to my fullest potential and the routine became boring.  At CoreBalance you will get a focused, efficient, no nonsense approach to getting a great workout in a short amount of time. It really is like having a personal trainer.  There are various rates from drop in to monthly-unlimited classes.  All of which are completely worth it.  And your first class is free.     In the past 4 months, I have experienced substantial strength gains, tone muscles and fat loss in many areas. CoreBalance has top notch, knowledgeable instructors that really know how to get the maximum results.   Before joining CoreBalance, I had never tried Spin, Barre or Yoga and was initially worried I'd get strange stares from others or singled out by the instructor. Quite the opposite happened.  Not only are the instructors supportive and nonjudgmental, they are patient and encourage you to work at your own limit and build up from there.   If you are tired of the traditional gym scene, give CoreBalance a try. The staff is friendly, helpful and really sincere about you being there and getting results. Grant has done a wonderful job of creating a community atmosphere.

Purchased a Groupon ($20 for $40 deal) for Milagro Grill. I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile now.   Came here for dinner with my husband on a Tuesday. The place is modern and clean. There was one other table of customers and a couple at the bar.   Our waiter was friendly and provided recommendations. Although he failed to mention the $2 taco special. That would have been nice to know. I ordered the Costilla entree and my husband ordered the swordfish. The Costilla came out looking pretty, but the taste was a bland BBQ seasoning. Your average BBQ beef on corn grits. My husband's swordfish was dry and overpowered by the spiciness of the beans it came with.  I added some of his beans to my plate to give my food more flavor.   With the side if chips, two margaritas and two entrees, our bill was $32 (with Groupon discount) add the tip and $20 I paid for the Groupon, it was still a sizable amount for what we got.   Overall we were not impressed with the flavor, quantity of food and definitely feel it was overpriced.

Delicious! I had the infamous "Ivan" for the first time tonight. This wondrous mound of meat along with a cold pilsner was the highlight of my day.   The beef patty was thick and made exactly how I ordered it. I added a side of avocado because I like it on my burger.   The Attic is small inside and parking is limited, but our party of 3 had no problem finding a table at 7pm on a Monday.   If you're looking for a good burger, I recommend giving this place a try.

Came to Eggstasy for breakfast with my husband. The four stars are primarily for the service. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating. Because we came in on a Monday morning, the restaurant was not super busy.   I ordered the basic eggs Benedict and my husband had the corned beef hash. The Benedict and hash browns were just okay. Nothing special with the flavor. My husband liked the way the corned beef hash was prepared (not undercooked and with a little crispness).    We also ordered a mimosa and Bloody Mary drinks. The first Bloody Mary drink needed to be redone. There was not enough spice or tomato flavor. The Bloody Mary comes with a chocolate covered piece of bacon. That was okay (maybe too much chocolate coating).  There are a lot of choices on the menu and because this place is new, I believe they are still finding their signature flavor. I'd be willing to give it another try.

I have been going to Tiffany for my hair care and color for over 2 years.  Tiffany does a wonderful job at doing what I like and makes sure my hair is well taken care of.    I now have both my daughters going to Shear Terror Hair Salon.    I love the down to earth atmosphere.  Tiffany's schedule is flexible.  Which I need, because I have a hectic schedule.  I often receive compliments on my hair and recommend my friends to Shear Terror Hair Salon.

Over priced and don't come hungry unless you plan on buying two entrees per person. My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday. Cute little restaurant and not busy (probably because it's new).   I had the white, chicken enchilada (notice not plural) and my husband had Guido's chicken. Both bland and again small portions. For $15 a plate, $5 for chips and salsa (which I believe should be free) and $7 margarita (happy hour price), we left still hungry and disappointed.   Two stars for service and hospitality. Other than that, we don't plan on going back.
