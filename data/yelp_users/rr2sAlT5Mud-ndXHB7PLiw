I have never had such a great experience. My husband and I came here for our anniversary and not only was the food INCREDIBLE, the service was out of this world. Heather was our server and she took amazing care of us with great recommendations and the most fantastic attitude! I recommend the chocolate lava cake but order it at the beginning as it takes a while to cook. Colleen stopped by as well and was so accommodating and friendly. The staff here made our special night absolutely perfect. I really couldn't be happier. If you're looking for great food and the best, personable staff, this is the place. :)

Been looking for a good Hawaiian place since I moved out here from Portland. This place does the trick. Bbq chicken is super good and I like their Mac salad. Will be coming back :)

This place is chill, only been on Thursdays though. Bartenders are efficient and polite. I watched a guy buss his ass all night I eventually asked his name (it was Sam). I've heard their taco Tuesday is good and they have pool tables so that's cool I guess. This place is a good time, but not the like the best time I've ever had. Employees are great though, it really sets a good mood for the night.

This place is great! Definitely sit in the a or b seats. We saw Jurassic World and the quality of the movie was great, service was good. They never brought my boyfriends water and that's why they didn't earn 5 stars but the ambience of this place is great! Try the Long Island, had a great buzz through the movie, and they're only $5 on Tuesdays!!! Price: very reasonable Food: only had the popcorn but it was good Drinks: delicious Movie quality: A+ Service: A. Waiters are nice, curious and care about your experience.  I would definitely recommend!!!!!!!!!

I've never written a yelp review before but this service really got under my skin. I asked for a bagel with cream cheese, deli turkey and cucumbers. I get this order all the time. This time they tried to charge me 6.99 for a "tasty turkey" sandwich. I tried to correct the lady and she refused. I went to pay and the girl at the front corrected the order for me but then proceeded to talk to the woman in line behind me and other employees about me saying I was "getting all emotional over my vegetables". By far the worst experience and service I've had. I felt like I was back in high school with people talking about me like that... This is not how you should feel while receiving service. I will never go to this location again.

It is rare that I leave a salon 100% satisfied with the services but this place can do it all! Morgan did an incredible job with my color retouch and eyebrow wax and tint! Had the privilege of chatting with the owner at the front who is truly a sweetheart! On top of it all, I found the cutest flannel in their adorable little boutique, what a great idea! I got my hair colored, my eyebrows waxed and tinted and a cute flannel for less than I normally pay for a cut and color! Will definitely be back and will absolutely recommend!

I'll just start by saying some of these reviews are whack. It's was my first time here and I liked it. This place is a nice semi-hidden gem in the desert ridge area. I got the spinach artichoke dip, a small pizza with spinach and mushroom and a half-baked brownie sundae! Food was great! Came out in a decent amount of time and tasted phenomenal. Service was great as well. I ate alone, but my server was extremely nice and had a good conversation with me, but didn't hover or bother me too much. Perfect! I spoiled myself to a brownie sundae, not knowing they are HUGE!! Let's just say, since I was eating it alone, I got some strange looks from the fellow customers. I would definitely recommend this place. They have a good deal going on groupon as well. Yum!

I went in to get my promise ring fixed and Jonah helped me. He fixed it on the spot and polished it for no charge!! So nice and friendly and they do a wonderful job. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this place. My ring looks brand new!

I've gone here a few times and started going because I knew someone in one of my classes recommended it to me. Food was good, although they put way too much oil and vinegar on your sandwich. Even if you only ask for a little! The last couple experiences have been ruined by the staff. The (I'm guessing high school age) boys that work there are extremely rude. I asked for a sandwich that a former employee used to make for me but I forgot his name for a second. I guessed and said his name might have been Jose (it was Angelo, way off). However, instead of politely correcting me the kid replied " Are you talking about Angelo? You were way off! JOSE!?" Then proceeded to laugh and call me racist.... It was a simple mistake and I did not appreciate being laughed at and called racist especially in an establishment where the workers should be polite and know better... The food is good, too bad I won't be back after that experience.

Just bought my first mattress, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience! Vince not only worked extremely well with my budget, but he got me a mattress I LOVE and went out of his way to make sure I had same day delivery! Don't even think about buying a mattress anywhere else. I can assure you, you will get the best bang for your buck right here!

Not sure what all the hype on this place is about... The ambiance is decent, I'll give them that. But the food was not good at all. Maybe we just got the wrong things? When I asked for recommendations from our server she gave us short, uneducated answers and had a bit of an attitude. Chicken fingers were about the same quality as the frozen ones at the grocery store.. I asked for ranch to hide the taste a bit and waited ten minutes for someone (not even our server) to bring it. Only to find out later that we were charged for it! We also got a French dip with au jus. Both the sandwich and dip were WAAAYYY to salty to eat. Disgusting.   Atmosphere: 4/5. Decent patio, new building.   Service: 1/5. Server did the bare minimum. Also should have warned us that they charge for ranch/extra sauce.. I've always been warned by servers at places that do that.   Food: 1/5. Chicken strips were edible but barely, French dip was beyond disgusting.   I might go again to try the burgers that everyone loves so much and give the place another shot, given that it's so close to my place, but my first experience was not good at all.
