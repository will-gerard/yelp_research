Best haircut I've ever had. Super nice barbers, right by the light rail, and they won't "break your bank". Definitely coming here every 3 weeks.

Kobalt, I don't need to say much. They know. From RuPaul Mondays to karaoke Tuesdays and Saturdays, this place is on point. I've never had one complaint, the bartenders are freakin amazing. Please don't come here if you're an a-hole, this is a berry friendly environment.

I'll keep it quick, you forgot some of our food. My grilled cheese sandwich looks terrible, is it really that hard to make a grilled cheese? Come on guys you're located in the Biltmore. This is embarrassing.

The food is terrible, every time my friends and I go here for a game they never get my order right. I don't get how you can mess up chicken strips. Although, Kansas (our waitress) and another waitress are always super nice and attentive.

The food is amazing, the service is better, and the restaurant's beautiful. New favorite place, my friends included.

How could you not love this place? The service is amazing, the food speaks for itself, AND there's a ton of TV's. I'd come here everyday if I lived right down the street.  EDIT: I live across the street now. By far some of the best seafood and bbq I've had. Julissa (sorry if it's spelled wrong) recommended the salt/pepper/lemon/lime on the side and I LOVED it. It's nice to see a staff that's actually attentive and knows what they're talking about.
