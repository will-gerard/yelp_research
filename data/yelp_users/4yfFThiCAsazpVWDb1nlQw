Love this course! I've played both Pine and Palm. I like the Palm course, becuase it is harder because of much more water in play. The Pine course is challenging as well, but I guess I just prefer the Palm.   The guys working out front are always helpful, and awake in the morning! I hate getting to a course, and the guys working the front are more asleep than me! The management inside are just as friendly. This is why I keep coming back to play.   I love the practice facility too! If I had more time, I'd be at their chipping green all day long (next to pine tee box #1)   I recommed this course to anyone!

I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, "Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it.   Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min-   Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!  After dinner, I ordered another margarita...  This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!  That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion. I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.  I will surely be going back, and I won't have a bad time.

This is my favorite course in the greater Phoenix area. The course is challenging, and the views are amazing!  This course is one that for some reason is generally overlooked as one of the best (in my opionion the best)  course in Phoenix. It is off the beaten path a lttile, (sitting in Fountain Hills) but is really worth the extra 10 minuet drive. Staff is excellent, The last 6 holes (the Wicked 6) are a fresh idea in ending a course, and I enjoy it thuroughly.   The practice green is well kept, and is a great determination of how the course greens are. The chipping green is one of my favorites in town.  Cart girls are friendly, and always smiling. Prices are just right!  Im always coming back, and they never give me a reason to not come back!

Went there last night, for a first date, and needless to say, it was interesting... not the kind of interesting where it was bad and you're trying to be nice. And the date, well that's another story...  I don't really like the decor. It's kind of got the Arizona cowboy/cowgirl thing going on which is cool, but I think that saddle ranch might have a better decorator guys.  Got a bottle of wine. It was the Cote de Nuits Villages - Louis Jadot. Great, earthy pinot noir - (was her choice) Im a hard liquor drinker myself... Anyways, our server corked, decantered (their decanters are awesome by the way)  and poured. It's a good wine... I guess.  Started with the grilled squid & shrimp salad, and the chantrelle & fried egg salad. Instead of one for each of us we were on a sharing frenzy. More to try? Cool with me! Both were fantastic! If you ever go here and they still have it on their menu - Get them. The grilled squid was cut into easily edible pieces which was easy to maintain and not have to dislocate your jaw to eat. Which was a plus since not eating like a rattlesnake is a huge plus on a date. The date thing back again?...  moving on...  Lemon used a lot in this and big pieces of fresh cracked pepper? Perfect.  The chantrelle and fried egg salad was a little too warn for my liking - I kind of expect a salad to be cold... maybe I was conditioned this way. That was just a little off, but it was still good. Popped the yolk, mixed it in, yum.  For dinner we did the Grilled Quail with creamy polenta, sauteed greens and fruit mostrada. Excellent. for the sides we did the braised endive, roasted turnips, and apples with the blue cheese and walnuts, and the spaghetti squash, sage-honey butter, and hazelnuts. These were perfect additions to the quail, wine, and atmos... ahh almost got me there. Im still lingering on the atmosphere.  That's why I'm doing the 4 - the atmosphere has to take it down by one star. After the remodel (if it ever happens, and it's better than it is now) I'll come back to this and update it. Service was good. Not extremely good, but also nothing to note in a bad sense either.  Overall, a nice white tablecloth, wine, good first date, kind of place to go. Dress accordingly!

Played there a couple of days ago. Not impressed to say the least. Facility is in fantastic shape for oversseding this time of year. (mid october) We showed up at 6 am for our 640 tee time. (that's plenty to get warmed up, get a cup of coffee, and use the bathroom before teeing off.) Clubhouse was empty. Ya know that xmas story when they say... "Nothing was stirring, not even a mouse?" Yea, that's what it felt like. Finally, after siiting around for 30 mins, the pro shop opens. We pay for our rounds, and get 10 mins to hit some balls.   *10 mins later*  We get to the tee box, no starter. Even the groundskeepers were running behind. Not a big deal, the guys were cool. With my limited spanish I was talking to one gentleman, and he was talking about how one course is down, and its a lot of work for them at the moment. I get it. They're busy, it's my day off, no big deal. The pace of play was slow, because each tee box we got to were being groomed, the tee boxes were on the side of the tee box, so we had to slow down a bit. Whos fault was that? Ours, of course. Golf course was in great shape, the views are amazing (I like Sun Ridge Canyon more, personally.)  *4 hours later*  Get done with the round, go inside for some food. Order drinks... 1 coke, an arnold palmer, a lemonade and a water. Server got 2 of 4 wrong. awesome! We order food, and the server says "Would you like to take care of that with a credit card or membership?" Well, in the REAL world, we wait till after our food arrives to usually pay... if you want a good tip anyways. Maybe I am in a different country it's otherwise... I answer I'll take care of it with cash. Here's his god to honest answer.  "We do not accept cash."  What?  Last time I checked, this is America, and it's safe to accept legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve, buddy.  Get the food, fries were the best part.    Get the check and the 20% is automatically added. Wow. We had a party of 3... not 8 or 10, 3.... Three. no wonder there was bad service.  TL-DR?  The service all around needs to be stepped up if. It's too far to be treated that way. But then again, if memberships is all they want, maybe they've found their niche. Old people all around, a nd a lot of people who don't care. Nice business plan, guys!  I'll pass next time.

I saw numerous reviews online with ok, and bad reviews. I decided I would give it a shot, because I know that some people do not have common sense. I decided to really look past any bs and give it a shot, because we'll, I don't trust most people. I was actually really looking forward to it... That was before I called.  There is a rule for ordering pizzas before 7pm, the cost is normal, and after 7pm, they go up in price. Probably because they are in old town, and well, people like to drink, and forget how much money they spend. I've never seen a pizza place do this before.  I live 3 miles away from this location. Phone call went like this. * represents my voice.  I call at 6:42pm, before the switch.  Best of Italy. * Yes, I'd like to make an order for take out. Where are you located? * About 3 miles away. We do not deliver that far. * why not? Because our max distance for delivery is 2 miles. * what if I was odering 20 pizzas? Tone of voice changes and becomes very nice, oh, yea, we can deliver that! * HAHA! *CLICK*  Now, I really just wanted one pizza, but you can tell these people only care about a the bottom dollar of their business and not about service... I cant make a huge difference, but i can warn you about what youre getting into before you call. All i know is that they lost this customer for life.  I wish I could make that up. I wish I could have even tried their pizza, but they make it so easy to not even get that far.

If your looking for a place to pop your collar, fist-pump intill the wee hours of the morning, load up on red-bull vodkas, and see the best cars in Scottsdale.... Then this isn't the place for you. Which is why the Lodge is my favorite bar in the old town area.   It is what the surrounding area isn't. And it's great to have a place like it. GREAT service, GREAT bartenders, Awesome people who hang out there. I've never seen a fight. And the only time there looked like there was going to be a brawl, was because some guys got lost going from the Mint to American Junkie, and thought they owned the place. I guess that's why I like this place. The people who come here, and the regulars really support it and try to keep it as it is. A great place to have food, grab a drink or two, play some games with friends, and make more in the meantime. Im happy to say I'm a regular here, and I enjoy bringingmy friends here as well.

It's tucked away, but don't let that stop you. We order from here a lot, and their food is awesome! I've had the bacon-onion ring- bbq sauce burger more thatn I can remember, and I can NEVER make the same thing at home! Kudos guys, and keep up the speedy service!

There are no complaints with this place for me. Great location, exceptional service, and friendly smiles all around.   I felt welcome here during my first night. My second? I was treated as family. Bartenders knew my name. Not just the drink I had before.   I really enjoy the freedom that the bartenders have. They can make whatever seems to be on their extremely creative minds. An apple old-fashioned that has a slice of said apple on it, then lit on fire to caramelize? Brilliant Nikki, brilliant.   I like a place that throws the generality of "a bar" out the window and adds their own unique-freshness to the mix. Speaking of mix. The dj's that come by are exceptional. A mixture of new and older-more down tempo music. Not your average "dj-press play." This is why I am now a regular here. And that's why you should be too. Proud to say it! See you all soon.  Want an inside tip, and feeling explorational? Order a "bartenders special." You won't be let down.  -You stay classy, Mabels on Main.

Bought a Dodge Ram 1500 from Airpark in January (week of Barrett Jackson). Family member recommended me to them after they bought a 2014 Laramie Ram brand new from them.  6 months...  6 MONTHS later, after my purchase I finally got my license plates - Reasoning? They sold me a car that they did not own.Let's start at the top.  I bought the truck all is good, and after 3 weeks I notice that my temp tags are about to expire. No big deal, I said, I'll call and speak to title. They told me they would call the title company they hire as part of the closing costs  and get an update and handle this issue. Cool, let's see what happens.  No call back that day, or the day after. Im sure they're busy and forgot about me.  I called back two days later and the title department told me that there is a hold on the vehicle from the state of the previous owner. There was a restitution on the vehicle, so I was driving a car with someone else's debt hanging over it, forced by the state. Child support, back taxes, take your pick of worst case scenario... I was sold a vehicle illegally. (you know, becasue you can't sell a car you don't own, especially if there is a debt by the state on the title.) So, Airpark sold me a vehicle with a title that was not previously cleared by the state.   I spoke to the salesman, and the sales manager, and they told me that 'they would take care of it.' By that they wanted me to come in and look ata similar truck for a 'smokin' rate to make up the issues that came about this mess.  Ok, cool - I thought. They know they messed up and they will help me out, get me a similar truck, same cost, and they can have the Ram with the title issue back while Im good with a good truck.  I show up at a designated time on the weekend open minded, and ready to 'be taken care of'. Boy was I taken care of. We start like I'm a new customer.  No apology,   No explanation,   Nothing.   The sales member (head of internet sales) was completely unaware from management of the situation or what was to be expected. They basically were wondering why I was there. I had to explain for the 5th or 6th time now about what happened and why I was there, and they were looking at me like I owed them something.   Absolutely ridiculous. After that I started looking at 90% of their used inventory online in research, I found that many had damage in their titles, and most were former renal cars. Rental car companies are '1 previous owner', right?   Nothing happened. No newer truck, never was 'taken care of'. The promises made were all temporary and it shows in their actions. They say they don't act like a used-car dealership in the 60's but that's exactly what I got through and through.   They not only lost the business of myself personally, but also the man who recommended me. Since then, a 2016 Ram 2500  Long Horn Laramie was bought, as well as another 1500 Laramie at a dealership not in the Airpark family. I made it a point to avoid the 16 dealerships owned by this horrible business. That's roughly 100K in sales right there gone because you couldn't keep a promise.

The location has changed, but not far. Same strip mall, but closer to the dunkin donuts.  I have to agree with Scott R. By far THE best barber shop I've ever been to. Robert is the best... I've been coming to this shop for close to a year now. Good hygiene is always a good choice, but with Robert at the wheel, it's an aspect of my appearance I never have to wonder about.   For $16.00 you get the works. Cut - any way you want. A shave around the hair line - both sides of the forehead, around the ears, and along the neckline. With warm shaving cream, a hot towel over the face - "Are you ready?" is his line - and it's relaxing.   Quick massage with a massaging tool, and a quick spray of some cologne to get you on your way.   He has CREW product all over the counter, and after my 3rd visit there he asked me if I would like some. I can style it my way after the cut.  My mom never did cuts like this - and I recommend him to all my friends. (well the ones that are dudes that have their mom still cutting their hair.)  Shop is 1 door west from the dunkin' donuts on Thomas and Heyden - and just says BARBER in red letters.   I almost feel bad doing this review - why? Because it's always been my little secret place to get a decent cut. And I don't want that to change. It has always been my "I'm gonna let you in on a little secret." kinda place.   Laid back - always sports, or discovery on the t.v. - dude mags everywhere if you have to wait - which isn't long at all He averages 20-30 mins for the whole shabang.  He's been doing great for so long, he needs more attention, and I hope this will help him out.

Cardinals opening day (8.25.2015) was BUSY!   My date and I grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by a man in the sell-line (an individual calling the shots and assists food coming out of the kitchen by passing the food into the servers hands to be taken out to their tables. All of that done correctly by the way). This man was energetic, funny, and really owning it. Well, that's because to our surprise, it was the owner!  Sami - a HUGE personal thanks to you and your great team at Gina's. The service that you expect and show when you are present really made our first experience one to remember.   Servers were busting their asses, so there was lots of movement. That, coupled along with the loud talk of tables in the room, and they exemplary teamwork seen really makes this review an easy 5-Stars. Did I mention not one-plate crashed while we were there? Always a plus in a intimate room with many people and quick service.  Service, easy 5-Stars.   Then the food came out: A big issue with other restaurants these days have is that many places are afraid to season. ****Not Gina's.***** For me, service can be impeccable, but if the food is 'safe' then what's the point of going to eat there? Anyone can make bland-gruel. Again, you won't find that at Gina's...  We got wings (mild), and the stromboli. Holy hell, it was seasoned! Our items were cooked perfectly (impressive as it was 1 hour before the game time and a lot of other places might have rushed the food, causing under-cooking) but not here. Wings were piping hot, and not greasy, The stromboli was perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey-in the middle with a helping of herbs, and garlic+ parmesan.   Lets talk about Marinara - no, not a 50-gallon barrel of Ragu that was trucked in from god knows where, but home made, herb-infused, you can see the garlic in the blend kind of - marinara. That is the kind you will find at Gina's. My marinara is top (Duh) - but a close second is Gina's, haha.  Chefs were very professional and their cooking skills were top-notch.  If you want to feel like you've been adopted by a family in Chicago and get fed some great Italian food, then I would recommend this to you.   Salute !

Went there recently. Bar service was slow. Food was excellent. Had the Turkey, Swiss, and Mushroom sandwich and La Palloma Margarita. I live in the area, work in the same industry.  During the course of my visit there, There was a hockey game on (Canucks vs. Predators) Of all the 40 T.V's there, there were only 2 T.V's that had this game on. (Granted hockey isn't big in AZ) 3 mins left in the third period, they changed it to a DBacks game... WHA???   At this point EVERY T.V. had on a basketball, or the diamondbacks game on... I asked why they changed it, and the bartender said, "They are watching it down there." (pointing to a couple opposite end who got there after me.) So, Stanley cup playoffs is less important than a beginning of the season baseball game? HA!  I brought a lot of friends, and some family. I was taking care of the bartenders with great tips all night long, and that was my thanks?  I moved to another bar inside, where there was no bartender, away from my sister, brother in law, room-mate, his girlfriend, my best friend from high school, and some buddies in town to finish this game that now was pushed into overtime. (which i obviously missed.) I expressed my concerns and how I wasn't feeling welcome anymore. No one really cared, except for one bartender Jenna. she was cool about it. Fixed the situation and helped as much as she could.   As I was getting settled in to the bar opposite of everything, the bartender from the other bar that I was at moments prior, came by and handed me my second drink without me even asking for one. I thought, cool, they know they messed up, a free drink? Sure it's not a big deal. After she handed it to me she asked, "Want this on a tab or still pay cash?"  Seriously?  I'll take my family, friends, and our money somewhere else.   And we did.

I had the chance to sit down and have a great meal here the other night...  I am happy and sad to say that this was my first time eating at an Iron chef's restaurant, that because I enjoy good food, and I thought I'd have been to one sooner than now.   I am glad this was my first time at any Iron chef's restaurants  Hosteses were very nice and seating was prompt. Server was Stephanie, and she was very knowledgeable of the menu. Even the food runners knew the menu, and explained the dish in detail when the food come out.  I started with the Michelada, made with Modelo beer. Spicy, and the perfect start. The roasted peanuts that came out after I sat were warm, which was a very cool idea. I ordered the ceviche (yellowtail) and the house guacamole. My sis and I cleaned the guac and I cleaned the ceviche. The yellowtail ceviche was a little too hot for her liking - made with some sort of addition of serrano peppers. I loved it.   Next came the white wine sangria. Seriously? Great idea. Im not a fan of drinking something that looks like blood. This was clear, sweet, and it'll probably be the only sangria I'll choose to drink ever again.   Main courses came out next - Carne En Adobo, and The Huarache De Hongos. First the Huarache - Corn flatbread on as the base, with wild mushrooms, black truffles, corn, and a cheese blend. Great! The brisket had an adobo wet rub, and was smoked for a long time. I made the mistake of trying to cut it with a knife. I felt dumb after it litterally fell through the beef. It came out with warm street style corn tortillas, and 3 mini salsas. All of them were different and interesting. the overall appearence of these dishes were really creative, and the overall enviornment was... ... different. There are some uses of materials that I never though I would see. Not like uncomfortable, they were used in a great way, it's something I don't even want to undulge to tell anyone because it's more fun to go and explore it for yourself. Huge plus for the Dias de la Muerte skulls in the walkway coming in.   Got to meet Jose Garces as well. I was thinking that most chefs, and even Iron Chefs were egotistical, but Jose was very approachable, and a really laid back kind of guy. It's good to know that it's all business in the kitchen, and a different attitude towards others in the dining area. Kudos, man. I'll definitely be coming back...   Overall, I had a great time, at a great new restaurant.
