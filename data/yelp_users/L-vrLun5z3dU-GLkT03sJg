We love Lo Cascio's! Service and food is always great (we prefer to it in the bar).  You can't beat $4 spaghetti on Sunday. My personal favorite is the spaghetti win pink sauce...., its to die for. It's a great family owned place and much better than any chain restaurant in town.

Delicious! I live nearby and have driven past this place hundreds of times.... Today we finally checked it out and were impressed. The food was fresh and there was a nice variety of items. We are not vegetarian, yet I was totally content with the flavor and quality of food. If you like Indian cuisine, you must try. The owners (husband and wife) were lovely and spent time chatting with all their patrons. We really enjoyed the experience and will visit again!

We love this place. The owners are so kind and they know our orders before we sit down. Everything is fresh and I swear by the pho when fighting a cold. I love the P7 with tofu and the spring rolls are lovely.  We eat here at least three times a month and love to support a small local business.

They came to my house for an estimate...... Conrad is nice enough , but never responded to my emails or sent me an estimate for my move. The customer service follow up was disappointing to say the least .....
