Cool retro soda shop, waitress dressed in 50ish outfits, complete with the red lipstick...the place was originally a pharmacy and soda shop est. 1928. Has the original counters. Go for the root beer floats, and the orange dreamsicle soda. Great place to relax and  listen to the old music, while sipping a cold concoction.

The SunUp Brewing Co.. I have wanted to come here for a bit really friendly staff. But I come to a brewery for good beer and did not find it here.The Sampler was ok I ended up enjoying one beer there called the cherry bomb it's a 9.6% bomb of goodness I could see it not being a session beer way too easy to drink.

Ladies and gentlemen let's get our feed bags on the portions are huge here. When you enter the restaurant there is a lot to take in lots of things all over to look at but pretty cool. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak two fork tender pieces of beef lightly battered fried and topped with  homemade gravy. All entrees served with salad or Cole Slaw homemade mashed potatoes and gravy or texaz fries bread and butter. I would say this meal could feed someone for a week it's a lot of food but really good so if you want a great Chicken Fried Steak it's a must try.

I have been going to this location for years but had stopped going the wings were going downhill. But recently I was in the neighborhood so I wanted to give it another try... Plus someone had given me a tip I need to try out. The tip is order the wings extra crispy and get them. (Spicy Mustard Asiago Parmesan Dusted) Plus I found out now you can get all wings or all drums or both that's a cool thing. I always enjoy the Seasoned Curly Q's fries... So I would have to say this lunch was really good and I will be back for more wings.

Quick friendly service. Good breakfast sandwiches, and also lunch. You can eat outside-but watch out for the birds-a girl left her wrapped sandwich on a table, and a lttle tweeter got right in the plastic basket and proceeded to help itself to breakfast!! Yes, we did let her know.

When I say I enjoy Boston Market people are like what... This is a one of a kind Boston Market the staff is always so friendly and will help you pick the best meal and joke around.  I always order the Quarter White Rotisserie Chicken with a side of Corn, Loaded Mashed Potatoes and Squash Casserole. The staff is so helpful they bring the food to what table you pick and are always around to fill your drink or get anything you need. The meal is always great and I can't get enough Squash Casserole so good...  I will be back soon for sure.

I keep hearing good things about Neo Tokyo and have driven by it way to many times. I went for lunch the restaurant was empty well waiting for my food I saw everyone was getting take out. The staff was really friendly the restaurant really clean... I ordered the lunch combo #1 Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice I also ordered the 3pcs Shrimp Tempura. The Chicken was pretty good for the price without the hot chili sauce it would have been a D- The shrimp Tempura was not crispy on the outside it was soggy that makes it a D- as well. I will not be going back for lunch anytime soon.

When I eat at Del Taco you would think I would order a taco but think again... I order two cheeseburgers but the key is to have them add jalapenos peppers to the burgers... It is one of my favorite fast food burgers a must try for burger fans.

Waitress wise:nice, attentive, good. Food wise: 2 people from a group of 6, liked their meal. Chips greasy and thin. salsa thin and watery. Reynosa salad appeared w/lettuce and seasoned ground beef. That's it??? Had to say: "where is the rest of my salad? Missing 5 ingredients... Brought out the rest of it... but, come on... it sucked. Enchiladas (steak) were good, cheese con queso is the best thing on the menu...Drink wise: Get the seasonal Samuel Adams, not a great beer selection..Nice clean restaurant..just needs to get better food..

Well I am a diehard Diners drive-ins and dives follower so I had to check out this spot... I will have to say really friendly staff but really slow service... Guy must have been suffering from sleep deprivation from his travels this was not good BBQ... The corn was just gross had to have been boiled in water for hours so over cooked. The chicken was so so and the beef brisket and pretty good pulled pork was ok... I was so disappointed with my experience here  the service was so slow they gave us two free beers it kind of made it a little better but not really will not be going back.

I think that Serrano's has a lot of hype because of it's been here so long and time builds memories of good times. I on the other hand have not had that I go places for good food I have not been impressed with any of the meals I have ate at a many Serrano's locations. I would really say greasy slop along with the chandler location served me a Fat Tire draft with a lime wow come on. So I say save your money and look elsewhere.

After eating a hotdog at Pittsburgh Willy's Gourmet Hot Dogs And More and chatting with the owner about how we both miss Yuengling from back east... I had to walk around and look at all the neat things for sale... I love old things I ended up walking around for an hour this place is huge... I am an antique junky it was really fun to see some cool things... But in all I felt most of the items were over priced but it's still fun to look... I will go back for sure to walk around and take a trip to the past.

Sat in the TV room.. pick the dining room for more comfort.  Ordered the sampler.. Czech Pilsner my fav.. not the best bewery in town. Our waitress, (Lauren) knew the beer, was very attentive. and personable. The food is mediocre..pricey bar food.  The Kobe burger was nothing special and the garlic fries soggy, the potato chip appetizer was cold and weird, cold chips w/some green onions, and hard chips of dark baccon sprinkled about...w/a side of blue cheese crumbles?? to do what with?? and more bacon, and something that was supposed to be Ranch.

I am a meat eater so when someone told me about this mock chicken sandwich I had to try it. We arrived to a pretty packed house it looked like a pretty hip crowd of people. Everyone was really friendly and nice we both ordered The Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich (Mock chicken with caramelized onions and peppers in our espresso BBQ sauce with vegan mayo) served with the thyme fries. This tasted just like I was eating chicken I was shocked really good sandwich fries were great as well. Will go back for sure..

The staff really friendly and helpful I ordered a beer off a list of beer I have never had before I went with a Karlovacko it's the house lager I really enjoyed it had to order another. When it came time to order started with the Asparagus & Prosciutto (Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and baked in our brick oven). A+ really good Italian Sausage (Homemade pork sausage, wood roasted mushrooms, onions, green peppers, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce). A++ You know something is good when each bit you say out loud wow this is good pizza. I will be back to this spot for sure lots I want to order still.

Walked in and the staff was really friendly they seemed to have a lot of regulars going in and out... I ordered the # 1 (3 tacos and beans and rice 1st taco Lengua   was really good 2nd taco Carne Asada was super good 3rd taco Pastor was good). Out of the three I would get the Carne Asada again really good salsa as well so this is a must stop for any fan of real deal street tacos.

I have been to Someburros a few times now... and I have to say I am not too impressed with this place on this trip I ordered the Crudo Burro - (Tender machaca beef combined with a spicy, light green tomatillo sauce with beans. The beans had no flavor really I covered them with salsa the burro had way to much extra tortilla but the meat in side was really good could have gave me a pile of that on my plate would have been a better meal... So I am not sure if I will go out of my way to revisit this spot.

I was on a burger kick and the word on the street was this place was it... Sat down at the bar and was blown back by the beer on draft it was stellar... Was greeted by Kristina with a smile and asked what we wanted to drink I had to have a sleepy Dog - Red Rover ... And some more chatting with Kristina helped me pick a beer flight I looked over the menu... I went with the Delux Burger (Blend of premium all natural ground beef topped with maytag and gruyere cheese, organic arugula and caramelized onion and apple wood bacon mixture all on top a toasted bemi-bagueette.  Plus an order of Half combination (sweet and French fries) The burger was really good and the fries as well it was funny the fries come in a little shopping cart made me laugh...

I have been going to Yapha's for years now and they never disappoint. Each meal you order you're able to get soup and a salad from the soup and salad bar. It seemed strange at first putting hot peanut dressing on a cold salad but wow that dressing is so good I could drink it. I always dump a little in my soup as well it's so good. The service is always a little slow but I would wait any day for such kickass food. I always order the drunken noodles with beef thai hot it's so good. A must stop for any one that loves great thai food.

I have been to this Oregano's a bunch of times now and love the food... You will want to come early for dinner it's always really busy... The staff is always friendly and will seat you as fast as they can... I always order something that's not on the menu the Mild and Gold wings they are the best wings I have had in Arizona it's the mild sauce mixed with the Italian gold sauce so good... Next on to the salad The Antipasto Thing  (Salami, pepperoni, capicolla, Romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, red peppers, red onions, topped with Italian cheeses and tossed with Italian dressing.) This is the best Antipasto I have had in Arizona now for the pizza... Aunt Margherita Pizza (Light and flaky dough, add pizza sauce, a four cheese Italian blend, fresh cut Roma tomatoes, fresh sliced basil.) After all this food if you still have room what I do is get The Original Pizza Cookie to go ( A 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, or Peanut Butter Chocolate cookie dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.  If you're looking for a great dinner this is one place you need to add to your list.

I was looking around for a fast place to get a bit to eat so I saw burger king... Plus I had a coupon for 2 whoopers and 2 small fries for $4.99 so I decided to give it a try. I enter to find no one at the counter I stood there for about 5 minutes before anyone came to wait on me... Someone finally came to the front and said how can I help you? I handed her the coupon and said I will have this... Ok cheese is extra I said that's fine that will be $14.27 I was like what that must be some expensive cheese. She says opps forgot to use the coupon I will give you cash back I said cool... So now I have to wait till she trys to figure out how much money to give me back with a super puzzled look she hands me back 1 dollar and 5 dimes... That his point I think I am in another world lol... I said you charged me $14.27 she says oh yeah at this point I am watching mind shut down the manager comes over at this point and try's to fix it I had keep the $1.50 on the counter I slid it back and said you take this money back and just redo it. So after all that she hands me back $7.10 I not even sure if that right lol... Plus there was a random hamburger in my bag looks like another fun Burger King adventure... I will not be back anytime soon or maybe I will your now entering the "Burger Zone" where people are over charged and random burgers appear in your bag.

I was looking for a new spot for Chinese food and I had seen all the reviews on yelp were good so I had to give it a try... We arrived to a really small area off seating about 20 people could fit in the whole place... I think the best bet is ordering take out seeing how everything is served in to go boxes... The staff was really friendly... My lunch crew ordered the Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken and Lemon Chicken. I rate the food as followed.  Mongolian Beef - C+ Orange Chicken - D Lemon Chicken - D Fried Rice -D Egg Roll - C+  I had high hopes for this spot after seeing the great reviews... The Lemon Chicken was like fried chicken bits in a clear lemon sauce that tasted like sprite. The Orange Chicken was chewy chicken with no flavor. The Mongolian Beef was just ok it... After such a lackluster meal I will not be back anytime soon.

The Wing stop I would not stop just keep driving... The wings were ok and I think a bit over priced for what you get some wings... I am sorry when your bill is almost $20 dollars for wings and fries it better rock. I would have enjoyed the fires but they were super salty this is one stop I will not make again.

This location is really clean and has a really friendly staff... They have a cool area in the back that's kind of like a lounge pretty hip. They have free wifi  so get yourself a Big Mac and surf the internet for the calorie count.

When it came time to buy a new bike... I was looking all around and I lived by this shop and stopped by really friendly staff... Helped me get measured for a bike... I did not end up buying anything but I have went back other times to buy other things I need for my bike... It's nice to shop at a business with a friendly and helpful staff.

I have been to Gandolfo's a few times and the sandwiches were always good... I have ordered the Knuckle Sandwich (Pastrami, Marinated mushrooms, olives, cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, lettuce, tomato, mayo, butter, olive oil on sour dough bread) It was really good a huge sandwich.... Another time I went with the King of Queens(Pastrami, swiss, cole slaw, tomato, & Russian dressing on a kaiser roll) I would not go out of my way to try this spot but I would give it a try if you're in that part of town.

Once again come on Guy you must be eating different food then they serve me... I have given Joe's farm grill two try's now and not impressed with the long lines to everything there... Frist visit ordered the same meal guy did Ahi Tuna Sandwich (Grilled rare, wasabi mayo Asian slaw with fries I also bought a order of onions rings... Well I was waiting I was so lucky to watch a loop of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives of Joes's Farm Grill on tvs they have there... My number is called and I get my food from the window the ahi is not rare at all so over cooked the oinion rings are so greasy and are not good this guy bummed... Second trip I have to wait 20 people deep out the door for lunch I order the BBQ Bacon Blue Burger (6oz, thick cut apple wood smoked bacon, blue cheese, hand breaded onion rings and Joe's real BBQ sauce... Once again it was not this meal that I was hoping for it was just ok really greasy and filling not my kind of meal... I will go back one more time in hopes that the 3rd will be the charm.

I had not been to Bev Mo for a long time and when walking around I remembered why this place is so overpriced.  Save yourself some money and head over to Total wine plus a lot better craft beer selection.

I have been to Sack's a few times now always really busy at lunch time... On this trip I ordered the Sack's Encore a hot sandwich (Prime steak, melted provolone, sautéed onions, hot peppers, feta yogurt dressing & lettuce with grated parmesan, on an 8 inch baguette with a side of potato salad. The Encore was really good I would order it again for sure and the potato salad was pretty tasty as well... each meal comes with a free cookie so that's a bonus to end a great meal.

I had driven by this spot many times and after the advice of my mother I needed to eat less red meat... I knew this would be the fix. I looked over the menu and went with the Adobe Panini  - Roasted turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo... Plus a small bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Bisque I am a huge fan of corn it was a must try... I rate the experience as followed.  Adobe Panini - B+ Corn Green Chile Bisque - A The Pickle - A+ Staff - A  I had seen some bad reviews not sure why... I really enjoyed my lunch I ate three extra pickles I am a huge pickle fan they were really good. I will be back for sure to enjoy another great meal .

I must admit when they first opened I was not impressed with this place at all... But I always give a second chance to a restaurant and I am glad I did. I always order a #1 Philly Original - (Served with grilled onions and cheese whiz "wiz" and an order of sweet potato fries. The cheese steak is good but I have to say the best part would be the sweet potato fries. Make sure to get all the extra condiment from the little refrigerator on the way out the fry sauce is a must for dipping.

I could not think of a place to go to lunch so I saw Paradise Bakery and said to myself I have not been here for years let's eat healthy.  The line was 13 or so people deep so I waited and saw what I wanted I ordered the you pick two half of a sandwich and a cup of the Fire roasted tomato soup. The way they run this place is like herding cattle with not directions it's a cluster F. The best part of the meal was the cookie and the pretty girl I spoke with in the line we had both not been here for about two years and both said we could see why.  I will be back to buy cookies there they do have killer cookies that's about it.

I walked into a pretty empty place was told to pick a table. I ordered  the all you can deal for $19.95 wait staff very friendly and chefs in the back pretty fun. First round came with the house salad and a plate of edamame and the miso soup. It was all really good I ended up ordering the Mexican Roll, California Top Spicy Scallop Roll, Jose Roll and the Gyoza Roll all really fresh. My only complaint was my water never got refilled the whole time I was there and the wait staff looked confused at times.

One day for lunch I entered Spices it was really packed and I found a menu and when I got to the counter to order...

I have been going to Arriba for years and it's always been a great meal. They have a great happy hour with free chips and salsa. A lot of people can't handle the heat from the hatch so they tend to diss like the food. If you can handle the heat I highly recommend these dishes.  Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast - Chicken breast stuffed with vegetables, cream cheese, and topped with queso fundido Served with rice and choice of beans. This dish is really hot at times Hatch Chicken Especial - Chicken guisado with diced green Hatch chiles, jalapeño cream cheese, and green sauce covered with shredded cheese. Served in a boat with fresh tortillas, rice, and beans. Another great pick would be the White Sands Chimichanga - A chimichanga filled with spicy pork green chile and covered with our tasty queso fundido. Served with Mexican rice and your choice of beans. If you enjoy spicy food cooked with hatch chiles you will enjoy Arrib Mexican grill.

I have been going to Teharu Sushi from the time it opened it was a lot different then. My last few visits were less than stellar. I got a warm piece of fish that made me gag and being cramped in with people stuffing their faces with sushi is not fun. I will not watch people eat for 35 minutes until they decide to leave so I can be seated. When it comes down to it's not a deal.

I was looking for a new spot for some Chinese food... I have seen this spot for sometime now I entered to an empty restaurant.. Waitress was eating lunch at the bar and got up and seated me I was looking over the menu and she was playing with her cell phone and packed up her food and took care of other people that worked there that were eating... I use to work in food service and we would never think of eating on the floor it takes away from customer service... It made me not want to order but I did anyways... I ended up ordering the Moo Shu Pork and The Mongolian Beef... I rate the experience as followed.  Moo Shu Pork - C Mongolian Beef - B Staff - D-  I am not into when they wrap the Moo Shu Pork up in the crepe... I like to build my own and you get left over's that way...The Mongolian Beef was pretty good but I did not like my eating experience at this spot and will not be back.

I have been eating at the Hot Wok AKA "Chinese Food" for years now... I  did eat in once and it was kind of a cluster of a dive in that place so I block those memories out when ordering deliver. I always order #49 Moo Shu Beef, #149 Mongolian style Lamb and some egg rolls. The Moo Shu Beef has to be the best I have found so far around Arizona and I love the lamb dish as well always a great place to have great food delivered.

Well I entered this place and I was thinking wow I am I getting old the music is so loud... No it really was I could hardly talk to my dinner guest I ordered a Kilt Lifter draft and looked over the menu... I ended up going with the Cheeseburger Sliders (Mini char-grilled burgers, topped with sautéed onions and melted cheddar, served on a slider roll with au jus. Plus an order of the Gorilla Wings Hot one dozen served with buttermilk ranch... Well let's just say this was one bad meal sliders were dry and thank god for the au jus... The wings were so rubbery I could only eat 3 and that was tough I am not one to say this but for $20 bucks worth of food make it taste like... I will not be back to this place Dan Majerle might want to roll down there and try the food behind his name.

Great selection of fresh produce, flowers, plants, etc. Always get the beef tamales from The Tamale store..best in the Valley.. Lil' Sassy's Salsa has a great Green Chile Sauce.. Pork On a Fork pulled pork is sublime. Frawg n'Turtle has interesting sauces.. Hot n'Horsey Apple Mustard, would be killer on a ham sandwich.

I am always on the hunt for a hot dog and antiques are in the same complex... Homerun so I took the trip to make it happen. I entered the complex and the smell guided me to the spot... I was greeted with a friendly smile and looked over the menu and went with The Arizonan - Fresh guacamole, peppered bacon, green chilies, fire roasted tomatoes and cheddar cheese and a Steel City Slider - Pittsburgh's famous "chipped ham" blended with Will's homemade BBQ sauce with a bottle of orange pop. I rate the experience as followed.  The Arizonan - C+ Steel City Slider - B+ Staff - A++  I did enjoy chatting with the owner a great guy... I also enjoyed the Steel City Slider it was like being at a picnic back home. I will be back for sure to try other things I hear the chili is top notch plus to help support local business owners.

For a one stop booze stop this is it... They have the best prices I have seen anywhere and the prices never change it's like a sale all the time. Huge selection of craft beer the cool thing is you can buy any of them in just a single bottle to see if you like it not end up with a 6 pack that you really have to fight it to drink it down...  They really support the local breweries as well tons of beers from all around Arizona.  Always friendly staff just an all-around nice place.

We entered Sleepy dog at around 9:30 it was really empty in the place I sat at the bar and ordered a sampler this is by far the largest sampler I have ever had at a brewery...  I finished the sampler and ordered a Red Rover my favorite beer... They have free popcorn and you can play board games at the bar I said Yahtzee anyone now I am drinking great craft beer and playing Yahtzee by this time the place is packed... They have a cool wheel you can spin for a buck to win drinks or money off drinks let's say I could not drink all I won lol... Plus they have a really cool TV that they will post pictures of your dog if you email it to them... I just think it's an all-around cool place to chill plus I always want to support the underdog.

All my lunch crew has said such great things about this place so I had such high hopes... I went to the counter and ordered the Lamb Souvlaki - Tender pieces lamb sirloin marinated and grilled with your choice of two sides... The sides I went with were fries and the vegetables... I mother tells me I need to eat more vegetables so I thought it was a homerun meal. I rate the experience as followed...  Lamb Souvlaki - F French Fries - C Vegetables - D  I have a lot of Lamb in my life and that was by far some of the toughest I have had but it did have great flavor... The broccoli was cut way to big and over cooked the only thing that save the meal was the side of the sauce I got they put on the lamb I drowned everything in it.  I will say I will not be back anytime soon.

I ordered the #56 Big Kahuna Cheese Steak on wheat bread (Grilled onions and peppers plus mushrooms, jalapenos and extra cheese)...  I have not looked back this is one of the best cheese steaks I have ever had in Arizona it's a must try for cheese steak lovers.

After a few trips to Riga Tony's for lunch I am a fan... They have a great weekly lunch special each day for $6.95 each dish comes with a really good Antipasta salad with a really good dressing.  The ciabatta bread is always really fresh and hot great for dipping.. I highly recommend the baked rigatony with Italian sausage Wednesday and baked stuffed shells Thursday. I will be back for sure it's great good with great prices.

Once I saw that I could get a Lukes of Chicago Italian beef right up the street it was a must stop spot. Walking in it smelled really good tons of choices on the menu. I stepped up to the counter to order the guy seemed less than happy to be there at this time. I ordered the Italian beef and sausage combo with the hot giardiniera with an order of fries. The bread was really fresh and the sandwich was so good even the fries were good and I am not a fan of crinkle cut fries. So if you want a great Italian beef this is the place come hungry it's filling.

Well I have to say I enjoyed the Sin City Smash Burger it was a burger dream. The Sin City Burger - Fried egg, apple wood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and the smash sauce on an egg bun. Plus the smash fries are really good as well. But keep in mind the Sin City Burger was on the menu in Arizona for a limited time so you might not see it on the menu but you can still order it. Plus they have a lot of great craft beer there so aways a plus.

On a fine Saturday had to make it out to this spot I kept hearing Beaver Choice is the best... I entered the restaurant everyone was so friendly you could tell everyone cared about what they were doing and wanted to put out the best product they could. I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon-Bleu (Half a pound double chicken schnitzel stuffed with French brie cheese and black forest ham served with a mushroom sauce. Severed with one side I went with the Pan Fried Thyme Potatoes along with three side salads I went with the Homemade Coleslaw, Marinated Green Beans and Sauerkraut... It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time it's hard to find home cooked meals when you're not at home. I will be back for sure I still need to try a beaver cookie.

I drove by this spot and had to stop for lunch... I am always on the quest for great street tacos so I entered the restaurant and was greeted by a really helpful friendly staff... So it's hard for me to give this review I looked over the menu and saw they had a Sonoran Hot Dog so I had to get it... Along with a Steak Taco and a Pork carnitas taco... I rate the food as followed.  Sonoran Hot Dog -D Steak Taco - D Pork Carnitas - D Chips And Salsa - A  The Sonoran Hot Dogs bun was really soggy it made it fall apart and not enjoyable to eat... The Steak Taco tortilla was really doughy the meat was kind of dry the salsa made it better... The Pork carnitas taco tortilla was doughy as well the meat was pretty good the salsa made it better as well... They have a orange drink there that was really good plus the salsa was really good... I will go back again just to get the orange drink.
