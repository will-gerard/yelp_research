Finally  a Cuban restaurant  that does it right!! I grew up eating Cuban food so I pretty much know what to expect.   We came in for lunch,  the place was busy which was a good sign.  I ordered  an appetizer - croquettas made of ham and beef.  They were delicious  and full of flavor. One of the better ones I've had in a restaurant.  For my meal I got the Lechon Asado, which is roasted pork shoulder.  The meal comes with black beans cook in the rice and a small salad.  I  also ordered a side of plantains.  The serving of pork was generous.  The pork was marinated with a garlic mojo and flavorful.  The meat was very tender and moist.  The rice and beans were excellent.   My friend  ordered the bistec empanizado which is a breaded thin steak it too came with rice and beans and a small salad.  I tried the steak, it had great  flavor but was a tad dry.  Still very good.   They will bring you bread for free.  The bread was very good.  All and all the service was good,  meals came right up.  Friendly staff and a good variety on the menu.  Prices were very reasonable.   I will be eating there on my next visit to the area.  Can't wait to try some of the other items.  The Cuban sandwich  and media  noche looked delicious  as they passed by my table.  Highly recommend  this restaurant.

We recently moved to Gilbert, AZ and it has been difficult finding good sushi. I've been to Sushiya Sushi several times now and the experience has been great every time. The fish is fresh and the portions are good. Sit at the bar and if you're lucky you will have Nicholas be your sushi chef. Nicholas enjoys his job and if you tell him of something you had elsewhere he will do his best to duplicate it.  Try the Phoenix Roll : Spicy Salmon, Cream Cheese, Avocado, crab, Masago, Deep fried, it's delicious! $8.50 Another good one is Geisha Roll : Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Crab Mix Inside. Tuna, Salmon, Yellow tail, White Fish on Top. Spicy Wasabi Mayo Sauce, and Sliced Onion on Top. Torched. $12.00 You can't go wrong with anything you order.   They offer cooked food, kids menu, beer, wine and sake. The prices are fair and the staff & owners are friendly. A good dining experience. They are open on Sundays which in California you could never find a sushi restaurant open on Sundays.

My wife and I have  been wanting to try The Deli in Queen Creek after reading all the great reviews on Yelp.  We went in for lunch to try it out. The restaurant is tucked in a corner of a small strip mall, you would pass it up if you weren't looking for it. The menu offered quite a few interesting items and we had a hard time picking.  We ordered the Warm Prosciutto Wrapped House Made Mozzarella for $5 and the broccoli cheddar soup (soup of the day) to start off with. the soup was one of the best broccoli cheddar soups I've had. It was delicious. The mozzarella came on skewers wrapped with the prosciutto lightly browned, we couldn't get enough!  We ordered the Cuban sandwich which was highly rated in the reviews. The Cuban sandwich was made up of Cuban style roast pork & ham with provolone,  pickles, and Dijon aioli on ciabatta bread Price: half -$4.65 whole $7.65. The sandwich was excellent and flavorful. We also ordered the (waitress recommended) steak sandwich which is roast beef, provolone, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, lettuce, mayo on  ciabatta. The mushrooms and ciabatta definitely made this a sandwich to remember. I think we agreed the steak sandwich was better (not by much) Than the Cuban. For dessert we ordered a molten chocolate lava cake with ice cream ( I wished we didn't share that...). They had several flavors of ice cream to choose from. The restaurant serves wine and beer.  Don't let the name fool you, this is a restaurant with plenty of seating, a wait staff and quite the selection of items on the menu to keep you coming back for more.

I'm  always  in search of good Cuban  restaurants., found this one on yelp.  We came in for lunch,  the place is small inside but luckily  we found a table.   I ordered  the Cuban sandwich with a side of black beans cooked with the rice.  The first thing I noticed was the bread was the right bread for the sandwich. Not just a friendly roll.  I asked and they bake their own bread.  The sandwich  was excellent  and rivaled any you would buy in Miami.  I also ordered  papas  rellena  which is a ball of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef then lights breaded and deep fried.  Great flavor. I ordered a guava  pastry to see how they did.  Also excellent.  I was not disappointed.   Looking through  the menu they had all the typical Cuban dishes and the prices were fair.  Average  dinner plate was $9-$10.  Just a note- my buddy ordered the Mexican style Cuban  torta (can't remember  the name of the sandwich) .  I tasted it and it was epic.  Such great  flavor.  It had pork,  onions,  cheese and other things that gave it a little kick but not too spicey. Look for it on the menu,  you will love it.   Hot tip- seating is minimal,  get there before lunch or dinner rush.  I got there about  11:30 and it wasn't  busy.  By 12:30 people  were waiting for tables.   All in all great food,  the owners were Cuban  and know their stuff!

I stumbled onto this restaurant while driving last year while in town. I thought Cuban food in AZ? How good can that be?  Well I was pleasantly surprised. First visit I stopped in for lunch and had PAN CON LECHON - Roasted pork sandwich.  It was excellent. I came back this year and had dinner there. Ordered the appetizer sampler with -CROQUETAS DE JAMON, PAPAS RELLENAS and meat empanadas. All were great. For dinner I ordered the #36 LECHON ASADO Slow roasted pork, shredded and saut√©ed with onions in our unique marinade   $10.95 includes rice and black beans and plantains. It all tasted authentic and very flavorful. My friends had the #33 BISTEC EMPANIZADO and #43 POLLO DESHEBRADO. Everyone loved their meal. Three of us a bottle of wine and appetizer the bill was less than $80. I also had the flan. They make it there and it is one of the better flans I've had. The consistency was that of cheesecake and not jello as you see in most restaurants. I'm Cuban and grew up eating this food and tell you it is authentic.

I give it one star for their customer service...  I went to this restaurant on their opening day after reading an article:  "Pancheros Mexican Grill, a fast-casual Mexican restaurant, is opening Jan. 29 in Chandler, and they'll sell $1 burritos to mark the occasion.  Burritos will be available for a buck a week later, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 5 at 2051 W. Chandler Blvd., Suite 1."  After being told to "come back Feb. 5th"  I showed the employee the article and she said no it was written wrong. I drove over 20 minutes to get here I told her and asked for the manager, she said he was busy...REALLY? Too busy to talk to an happy customer?   I am not unreasonable after I left I can see their ad was poorly written and easily misunderstood. I would expect a manager to come out and speak with me and explain what happened in the least or act like they care about their customers.   I don't like to give one stars but in the few cases that I have it is usually for bad service. I would have paid full price for their burrito, but after the way they handled the situation I have no choice.
