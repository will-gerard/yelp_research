Absolutely the most authentic, delicious Japanese food in the valley. Having lived in Japan and grown to love their cuisine, this is the only restaurant I have tried in the valley to duplicate the flavors and presentation I experienced while over there. The place itself isn't much to look at, as it used to be a Dunkin Donuts back in the day, but don't let that turn you off as you would be missing out.   Unlike many "Japanese" food establishments it is actually owned and operated by a Japanese couple who make and prepare all of the food themselves right when you order it. From the mouthwatering Sukiyaki and Tanin, to my girl's favorite, the Oyako Domburi, you can't go wrong with Nagasaki Grill. I can't recommend this place enough.  If you want the real thing, there is no other place even close.

I write this review with a degree of sadness. Yoko's was a place I used to frequent at least once a week. Partly because I lived about 3 minutes away, and partly because it was quick, fast and tasty Japanese/Chinese food. Not authentic, but it was a good place to chow down on some Americanized Asian cuisine.  That was 4 years ago. It's gone downhill since then. The place is still the same physically. But as far as food, they went from fresh, tasty chicken in their dishes to rubbery bland chicken. The sauces are not up to snuff anymore. It's evident they've switched suppliers for whatever reason and it's just not worth the trip.  I think the place survives by virtue of Mesa High School being within walking distance of the place and not due to the quality of the food. It's edible, but that's about as far as it goes.

Charleston's... Where to begin.   We happened upon this place mostly by accident. It shares a parking lot with Texas Roadhouse which is a great steakhouse but because of that fact, at any given time it's extremely crowded. We had planned on hitting Texas Roadhouse for dinner before catching a movie at the nearby Mesa Grand AMC Theater. However, as is always the case it was packed, and we were told it was a 45 minute wait. Seeing Charleston's across the way, we said why not?   Upon entering the place we were surprised to see how well done the interior was. Classy, with dark wood and stone accents and lit just well enough to maintain an intimate atmosphere. Each table is lit by candles and soft overhead lighting. Up until recently it had some real smooth Jazz playing in the background (which has regrettably been replaced with easy listening/pop fare in an effort to attract a younger crowd).  All of the wait staff male or female is dressed in black slacks and black shirts which may sound pretentious but only adds to the ambiance in practice. They are, in general, extraordinarily attentive and quick to serve. On most weekends, the management helps bring out food, refill drinks and make sure everything is satisfactory. Nice touch.   Now on to the food... oh the food! I have yet to eat a meal that was less than excellent no matter what I order but my favorite is the Baby Back Ribs and Herb Chicken combo. It's a huge plate of food, and it comes complete with garlic mashed potatoes and I opt out on the bbq beans in exchange for the glazed carrots. You MUST eat the glazed carrots if nothing else... I do not like carrots at all mind you, but these I could eat all day until my skin turned orange.  Aside from the carrots, the herb chicken is actually a half a chicken seasoned perfectly and very succulent. I've scoured the internets trying to find the recipe for this bird and it's nowhere to be found. I'm considering a part time stint at this place just long enough to poach the recipe or at least watch the chef do it. Delicious. Sub out the potatoes for the fries (they're crispy, and salt & peppered) and you won't be disappointed either.   It's never as crowded as the neighboring Roadhouse, but to me that's a good reason to check it out. It's great.  Tip: Check out their menu on the web before you go. It'll give you an idea of the kind of food they have in store for you.

I'm gonna go against the grain here and recommend something on their menu no one seems to say anything about. The hot dogs.  What's that you say? Why eat the hot dogs at a place called Giant Hamburger? Because they use the best all beef dogs around. I don't know where they get them from, and quite frankly, I don't care because they're big and delicious. This isn't a shriveled up little wiener you find as a side item at most places, it's a big juicy 1/4 lb dog. Pair that up with always crispy and tasty fries and you have yourself a meal.   I've also had their hamburgers and they are as delicious as they say they are, but the home style breakfasts are a favorite for us. Eggs cooked to order, sausage, bacon, or ham, on the side with hash-browns, OJ, toast, and an orange wedge to sweeten the deal.   A friend took me here 6 years ago and I have become a regular ever since. Oscar knows us by name and is a great guy. Highly recommended.  It's cash only, and decent price for the amount you get. We usually get out of there for around $12-14 for the two of us. This place is built in the old diner style with booths, small tables in the aisles, and a counter lined with barstools. If you go in the off hours, it's generally easy to find a place to sit, but the place is usually packed during regular breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours.   (Side note: they'll make breakfast anytime of the day you want it. I know this because my girl had a craving for their french fries and french toast at 8PM one night... yeah. And she's not even French. ;) )

Why am I the first to review this place? It's been on the map for as long as I can remember and it's been the same icky, weird staff and "just okay" Japanese food for just as long.   In any case, it makes a compelling case as as nicer than average restaurant. It's a large building and has all the hallmarks of a great Japanese eatery. Sushi bar, live seafood you can choose yourself, and management that hires native Japanese to serve you. All signs point to greatness!  Somewhere between the Greatness road sign and the arrival at actual Greatness, someone seems to have taken Mr. Potential and kicked his teeth in before repeatedly punching his groin and laughing as he robbed him of his money.   Let me explain:  I have give this place repeated chances to show me that it's worth the real estate it's planted on and repeatedly I have felt like Mr. Potential must have felt after his beating.   I've been there with groups, alone, on dates and each time it's either inattentive or rude wait staff and middling food that isn't anywhere near the price of admission.  The last (and final) time I went to Ichi Ban (ironically meaning Number 1 in Japanese HA!) I took my girlfriend of a year as a treat for both of us. Why did I go here? You ask a good question and I have no acceptable answer other than I may have subconsiously wanted to break it off with Sandie (I now have nick-named her "The Sand Demon" - say it out loud. It makes sense... seriously. Sand Demon... Sandie... but I digress) and this was a perfect way to do it.   The food was once again quite bad and to add insult to injury, after delivering our food our waiter began his assault.   Upon finding out I speak fluent Japanese, he switched entirely over to speaking Japanese. Leaving me to translate everything into English for the Sand Demon. As if that weren't bad enough, he began asking me if she was "a dirty girl" because she sure looked like one to him.   I couldn't believe what he was asking me and definitely wasn't going to translate it for Sand Demon, but just in case I misunderstood him, I asked him to explain what he meant. He went on about how she had a nice rack and long legs and that she just looks like a good time in the sack.   Some people might view this as a compliment in some way, but I usually don't have kind words for a guy who tells me my girlfriend looks whorish and a good lay. I told him in my most polite Japanese that he'd never get the chance to find out since he most likely couldn't get laid in a brothel and we left.   At the time it wasn't funny, but it's pretty funny now. Sure, he was being rude but in retrospect she was kind of a whore. But there's no review area for ex's by the name of Sand Demon so that's all I'll say about that... for now.

My Dad used to make fun of me whenever I would bring these wings home. Having been raised on a chicken farm he would go on and on about how those wings must have come from sick chickens because they weren't very meaty compared to say... wings from Native New Yorker.   He's not entirely wrong. They aren't extremely meaty wings, but they are relatively cheap. You can walk out the door with their special, it's 6 dozen wings for roughly $25 or roughly .35 cents a wing.   But price isn't why people go there. It surely also isn't the facilities since they are truly abysmal and more than a tad bit scary unless it's high noon and you go with a friend.   The reason people eat these wings is because the sauce must have been created on Mount Olympus to give the Gods their hot wing fix. I swear it's so good you almost want to lick the container once all of the wings are gone. I've actually saved the sauce for use later to put on other food I cook at home! It's just that good!  I can only vouch for the Medium sauce though, as I don't get into the Hot or Suicide flavors. I like being able to taste things for the 24 hours after I eat my wings...   Highly recommended if you don't mind packing heat to get in and out of the place. Or maybe a Taser.

I have been a loyal iPhone customer for over 4 years. Between myself and my wife we have owned 5 Apple products, 4 of them being iPhones. However when seeking a replacement for my cracked screen at this location they asked for $150 to replace it. The "Genius" even confirmed that the original crack was definitely a defect, but because the crack had progressed since then, they couldn't replace it under warranty.   Having spent thousands of dollars on their equipment, and receiving no consideration for even a declared manufacturer's defect. I have decided to quit buying products that are expensive, defective, and that they refuse to back up with warranties that mean something.   Goodbye Apple. Hello.... pretty much anything else.

Earnhardt's Chrysler Jeep robbed me of my innocence.   I went to Earnhardt's to test drive a Wrangler, and thus begins my first encounter with the demon seed known as Earnhardt's Sale's Staff.  I was looking around the lot, and checking out different versions and years of the Wrangler when a somewhat smarmy but otherwise friendly salesman asked me if I was interested in a Jeep. I told him, that I was, but not interested in buying anything, just a test drive.   He said that was cool, and asked me which one so I could drive it. I picked a white Sahara. He grabbed the keys from the front desk, got a copy of my ID and off we went. It was nice, but when he shot me a price of over 30K for the thing, I balked and said not a chance.   So we went back to the lot and he suggested he take me to the back lot and look over all of the Wranglers they had to find one within my price range. At this point I didn't know jack squat about how much one should cost because I didn't expect to buy anything, but I played along. We finally found one that he told me was in my price range (I didn't tell him how much I wanted to spend, so how did he figure that out on his own?) and so had me test drive that one instead.   It was nowhere near as nice as the Sahara, but the sticker said 23K so it wasn't as much of a shock to the system as the 30K+ was. Even still, I wasn't really interested at that price. Undaunted in his quest for a commission, he asked me if I had a trade. I said uh... yeah. His eyes lit up like a kid on Chrismas morning.   "Well, we could easily get the payments as low as you want them with a trade! Let's go run some numbers." I replied,"Um... no I'm cool. I'll just take my car home".   Then he whipped out the phrase that ensnares hapless first time car buyers across the country into their web of high-pressure sales: "What could we do to get you into this car Today?"  I said "A payment below $200".  Now anyone who wasn't as naive as myself at the time, would know that no matter what the salesman says at this point, there's no way you can finance 23,000 for $200 a month without rolling it into a 15 year mortgage. Regardless, he assures me that that is possible. :|  To make a long story short (too late I know) after 8 hours in a torture chamber filled with "sales managers" "closers" and "finance guys", I drove off in my bone stock Wrangler SE at a payment of $383 and a really bad headache. They told me I had gotten a GREAT deal, so they must be telling the truth right?  Much like a bad one-night stand, everything looks much different the next day with the lights on. Too bad it took me a year to really scrutinze the deal they gave me.   They sold me a Jeep that was listed at $17,995 for $17,995 with $5,000 of what was labeled "Additional Dealer Markup" in tiny little print at the bottom. However, since I never looked at the sticker myself until long after the sale, I didn't see it.   My dealings with their service department have been equally lackluster and I have warded all of my friends, family, enemies, religious leaders, professors, random strangers, and pets to stay away from Earnhardt's.   The only good thing I can say about Earnhardt's is that they have a huge stock. If you must visit them, find the model you want in their inventory, take a test drive, and then go to another dealer and get that car from them. No Bull? Yeah... except for the $5000 worth of bull on the sticker price.

Kelly's Cajun used to be my number 2 favorite fast food in the valley. I'd regularly pick up a Blackened Chicken /  Honey Lemon Chicken combo after a long night evening in the lab at ASU. It was quick, the portions were extremely generous, and the Asian family that ran it was always friendly and acted like they were old friends whenever I'd drop by.   Unfortunately the family that ran it is gone and the food has suffered for it.   What was once a delectably spicy Cajun flavor on the blackened chicken, is now scaled back severely and is mild by comparision.  The garlic noodles were once actually garlicky are now just slippery and greasy. The Honey Lemon chicken is now overcooked and has lost nearly all of it's unique sweetness. The most egregious difference is that the new ownership has entirely removed the Cajun potatoes from the selection of sides available.  If I were to write this review a year ago, I would have agreed with the other review by W. It was a hidden gem in Arizona Mills mall. It's now just meh. I'm now looking for another spot to get my Cajun fix. Any suggestions?

One day I asked my mother if she wanted to go out to lunch. I work about 15 minutes away from her, and in the interest of saving time I told her to recommend a place we could go near her.   She said she had a coupon for this place where she'd had fry-bread tacos with her friends a while ago. My inner self said: "Um... fry-bread... taco? That sounds... odd. Fry-bread. Those were the things we ate at school carnivals with honey and powdered sugar right? So... now it's in taco form? Erm... sounds... gassy." What I said to my mother was something like "Ok. Sounds great."   Upon going inside the first thing I noticed was that we were the only people in the place who weren't Native Americans. This is a good thing because you can be pretty sure it's authentic, no matter what you order.   The menu is short, but hearty. You indeed can get the old sugar covered fry-bread like you had as a kid if you want it. There are also a bunch of other toppings like ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinnamon as well to make your sweet tooth ache if you so desire.  In addition to the sweets, they had Navajo Tacos, Apache Tacos, and my personal favorite the Red Chile and Green Chile Meat Tacos. Tribal Burgers as well as Hominy Stew round out the menu.   What a great change of pace the food is! I was very pleasantly surprised when I ordered the Green Chile Meat Taco. It's massive. They allow you to order a half size too, but I'm a man right? I gotta eat the full size. The meat is delicious, and the seasoning will wake you up without making you sweat too profusely. Both the Green Chili and the Red Chili are great and very satisfying.   Despite my concerns, the slightly sweet fry-bread mixed with the spicy meat was an excellent combination of flavors. If you're looking for something different, but familiar at the same time you owe it to yourself to check this place out.   Location-wise it's not in a great area, but serviceable. It's in a strip mall with a big FedEx/Kinko's attached to it and across from a Food City and a 99 cent store.   My only gripes are that the menu is kind of sparse and if you go into the place in a suit and tie (my work outfit) you'll get looked at funny. Just dress casual and enjoy.

I was raised on just good old plain hot dogs. I had tried some of the hot dogs with different toppings on them in different configurations over the years. I quickly came to the conclusion that for the most part, hot dog places in the Phoenix area pile on the toppings because the hot dog itself is not a good one.   Since I was raised on plain ol hot dogs with minimal toppings I came to appreciate what a good quality dog was and what a poor quality dog was. In my book, if the underlying hot dog isn't good, then it doesn't matter what you pile on top, it's still a crappy dog.   Hence my hesitation on going into Pittsburgh Willy's. From the menu, it's clear that they specialize in unique dogs with a variety of toppings.   I ordered the Pittsburgher, which was a 1/4lb all-beef dog, thinly sliced and chopped ham, cheese, and peppered bacon bits. Yes. That was all on the dog.   Verdict? Pittsburgh Willy's uses a high quality, delicious dog underneath an equally high quality delicious layer of toppings. The ham was light, the bacon was just right, and the cheese just made sure it all stuck together while I leveraged this dog into my face hole.   I would recommend this place to anyone who really loves a good dog and can get there during the hours. I would have rated this place 5 stars, but with the hours being fairly short it is difficult for me to get here with the exception of my day off, so 4 stars it is. Also, I think the place would benefit from a better, more obvious location, since as it is now it's a small part of a much larger antique store, and I never would have found it if it weren't for a referral from a friend.  I will be back as often as I can.

We live about 30-40 minutes away from SMG but it has become our number one place to go for date night by far! Given, you do have to get there early or purchase reserved seats online in order to get the good seats, but how many other theaters even give you the option of reserving your own seats without paying a ridiculous amount of money? For about a dollar more than regular price you can sit wherever you choose to and get there a little later and not wait in line.  As for us, we love getting there about 30 to 45 minutes early so we can order food and drinks and enjoy the meal before the movie begins. Doing so allows us to eat at our own pace and with the lights on, and then nibble and snack on whatever we didn't finish throughout the film!   On that note the food is delicious. Every time we go, we try something new and haven't been disappointed with any item on the menu. The best part for me at least is that I tend to drink soft drinks quite a bit during movies, so having a refill on demand by pushing a button is a revelation! Don't forget to indulge in the popcorn as well, since it is popped from a very high quality, large popping kernel and served with a side of real melted butter (not butter flavored topping), so you can douse it in butter or leave it off if you want a healthier option.  The staff from top to bottom was exemplary and attentive. I had originally thought the wait staff would be extremely distracting, but they are discrete and do their best to be as invisible as possible as they bring everything from popcorn and drinks to full meals at any time you want before or even during the film.   Great execution and the food is no more expensive than a typical bill from Chili's, however the quality of the food is head and shoulders above your typical bar and grill fare.   A smart tip for those complaining about waiting in a long line: they have a line dedicated to people who pre-purchase tickets. That includes people who purchased through Groupon as well as SMGs online site. With the "On-Call" line we have never waited more than 5 minutes and usually use our Groupon, which they run regularly and is five dollars which includes any movie and a non-alcoholic drink. $5 for a movie, drink and a speed pass through the line? Who complains about that?
