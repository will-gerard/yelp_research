I guess that the organization overall is good, but wonder why one of the most needy populations in all of our communities is dismissed by this organization.  I am referring to kids who are in foster or kin placements through CPS.  I know we have tried multiple times to get children hooked up with a big brother or sister only to be told that CPS kids are too transient with their case managers and placements so they wont work with them.  Who cares if the case manager changes, if the kid is in a placement that wants to have them stay there for years or even adopt them.  Case mangers and social workers at schools and hospitals change but they will set those kids up with Bigs.  I don't understand why this company wont work with Arizona CPS kids.    Kids who have been removed from their parents are more at need of a positive mentor than any other population, yet are pushed aside by VBB-BS.  And when you ask for a reason why all you get is the "they are transient" story. And I guess the kid with the single parent who cant keep a job is stable?  They appear to me to be an example of "get the good PR", and forget the rest.

I miss this place.  I used to work right across the street from McAlp's and would go there at least twice a week.  The atmosphere is great, food is good, and deserts are tasty.  Its nice to see that some places in the Phoenix area don't feel the need to constantly renovate and are not afraid to keep their days gone by look, feel and approach to business.  Writing this is making me hungry for their food again.  I need to find an appointment to schedule downtown so I can lunch there next week.

One of the few places that I have eaten at with friends then taken my family to later on.  First a word of warning, this place is dark...not dark like medieval, but dark like the lights are not working.  My grandparents had a bit of a time making their way through but the staff was very good about assisting and getting us a table near the door.      The bar downstairs is very cool, if you get there and can find somewhere to sit.  I was enjoying it so much the first time I ate there that I didn't want to take the elevator upstairs when it was time to be seated for dinner.  The menu is varied and full of varied salads, meats, and pastas and the appetizers are just as good if not the best part of the menu.  I am not a wine guy but those who were did their best to add several empty bottles to the collection in the wine racks on the walls.  They said that they enjoyed the selection and variety.  I enjoyed the selection of beer and tequilas.    Give it a shot, but wear your headlamp!

Despite going through several different owners in the last 10 or so years the recipes have stayed consistent as has most of the friendly and helpful staff.  The new owner's added sushi which is made to order, is fresh, and very tasty.  I usually go for the spicy white meat chicken teriyaki bowl, spicy with brown rice. Their version of spicy is spicy so order with caution.  The chicken is moist and tender, with a nice smoky teriyaki flavor.  Brown rice is fluffy and moist for a brown rice, white rice is sticky with the proper texture that absorbs soy or other sauces.   Others I have gone to eat with have ordered a variety of items, and I have never heard a complaint other than the inability to finish the meal.  As stated before the seating area is small, they do a lot of take out business and if you need to talk to a member of the Glendale or Phoenix police or fire you will probably find someone from those departments eating there.

In brief, avoid the Wal-Mart auto center at this store.  My wife took our car in to get the tires rotated, the workers told my wife that they refused to rotate the tires as they were so worn down and told her that the car needed immediate replacement of all 4 tires or she was risking a blowout leaving the parking lot.  I told my wife to take the car to Discount tire to see what they said.  When she told the high pressure salesman she was leaving she was told that she was a "fool" and they then took over 10 minutes to find the keys so she could leave.  Discount looked at the tires and said that we had at least 15-20,000 miles left on the tires.    Last month the battery on our other car started going out, and when I looked at the battery to see where to take it for the warranty, it was Wal-Mart.  Ok, we had to go back or pay for a new battery (in hindsight should have gone to another Wal-Mart auto, my mistake).   We were told that our alternator was bad and or the started, no way the battery was bad.  I insisted that they test the battery and they again tried to tell me that the alternator was bad even when the battery tester was showing it was in the "replacement" zone.   The guy finally agreed that they would replace the battery for free as it was still under the full replacement time frame.  It gets better.  There was no one else there getting a car worked on.  Not one oil change, tire rotation, wiper replacement, nothing.  Guy told us that it would be 45 to 60 minutes to get the battery replaced.  Fine, I will sit in the waiting room.  His look made it obvious that my waiting did not please him.  Finally after he spent 10 minutes playing on his cell phone he called someone up who took the keys and replaced the battery in 5 minutes.  I don't know what it is that makes these scammers here feel that they can treat customers so poorly, but they do it.

When I am having a sugar craving after busting out a gargantuan trail run, I hit this place up. Muffins, cupcakes, all sorts of gluttony inducing items.

I really like this place, they open early, have coupons they let you hang on to for future use and the atmosphere takes you back to an earlier time where you would not be afraid to strike up a conversation with the person sitting next to you (think Floyd's barbershop from Andy Griffith).   It is in a older strip mall that is home to several other also very cool places that shall be reviewed at a date to be determined later on, right on the border of Sun City and Peoria.  Due to the proximity to Sun City a lot of old timers go here to get their hair cut, many of them Military vets.  Some days I could sit there for a few hours and just listen to the customers talk to the barbers about how things were, are, and should be.  Great stuff...reality show perhaps? (I need to get working on that). Both barbers have cut my hair and they do an equally good job of making me look my best, for $7-with my coupon. They also sell sports cards and memorabilia as well as hats representing several Military branches.  Anyway, if you are nearby and need to get your hair trimmed stopping by here is not a mistake-and you can grab a good meal at one of the adjoining establishments.

My daughter is quite the doll connoisseur, and when she saw the dolls and how well made her "American Girl" dolls suddenly became relegated to the corner and under the bed.  The dolls are a bit pricey, but not when compared to American Girl and the like.  They have every accessory that you could want and when you bring your new dolls back in they will do a full check up and well baby clinic.   I am surprised that this place isn't more well known.  Once it is, if you have young girls in your life who like dolls-you better watch out.

I agree with Viki, after KOOL decided to turn KSLX this was the only oldies station in the Valley, and since it is AM the songs had a more oldies feel to them.  Now it has gone talk and for the last two days sports talk has been on in the morning so I guess AM music is gone now as well.  This stinks.  A good station runied. 580 AM in Marana is gone now as well, so there are no true oldies stations out there.

Have yet to get what I ordered when going through the drive thru. Called back once to tell them how badly it was messed up and got hung up on twice. My fault for not triple checking but you should get what you order and pay for.

Took my kids there to grub after this place was recommended by a co-worker.  One got a burger, the other a hot dog.  Thumbs up all around, although the fries were not their favorite.  They started it is their second favorite burger joint only behind San Diego's Hodads.

Good selection of beer, I dont drink wine but there is plenty of that too.  I can easily spend 30 minutes here browsing the selection of brews.  My cousin from North Carolina went with me last time he was in town, he could not believe how many beers they had.  I wish they had a larger selection of cold beers or singles in the cooler for when you are making that last minute custom 6 pack, but no tthat big of a deal.   They will pester you to death about the Bev-Mo card, save yourself some grief and just sign up for one, you can even do it online.

As a bit of a  beer snob I was pleasantly surprised by their selection of microbrews...including the awesome Oskar Blues brand (best canned beer in the universe).  Food looked good, if you dig wine it is a place to hit up for sure. Next time I stop by I will order some grub and report back.  Probably the busiest place in Vistancia per sq. foot.  Good atmosphere, but some stuffiness from some of the Trillogy folk who apparently dont like people under 50 being around them-but that's cool.  I will be back.

Very good thin crust or deep dish pizza, the veggie is awesome.  Their wings are hard to top as well.  Owned by the guy who started the Grande Pizza on Union Hills, he is now out here to make this Grande as good as his last one.  Inside seating is somewhat cozy but very doable, even with kids.

I really wish that they had chosen another location for Carolina's as my office shares the same parking lot and it is way too easy for me to walk across the parking lot and grab some of the best grub around.  Very hard to keep in marathon shape when eating there 4 times a week-I am weak with the discipline.  Their tortillas are the best in town hands down.  I had never tried a buttered or cheese tortilla until a co-worker ordered a few...very addicting.  They only have one salsa which is not fiery but has a kick, and their chicken burritos are just that, chicken and a tortilla.  No Chipotle style faire here. There is ample parking but seating can be a problem for those who don't work next door.  Hit 'em up if in the area!

Best burger around these parts.  I had a turkey burger that was moist and flavorful, not easy to do with turkey.  I really like how you pick everything on your burger from the bun to condiments, some of the choices are interesting and tasty (raw jalapenos-hot!).    Onion rings were not greasy, but had tons of taste-didn't even need ranch or something to dip them in.  My dining guest had the veggie sandwich that was also near perfection, maybe just a touch too much oil on the veggies.    Only problem for this place is that the center is dead.  6 PM on a Friday and the place was not even 25% capacity.  I hope it makes it as this is a great place to grab a bite.

Pretty dang good food, 'specially for the area.  I work down the street and after several co-workers told me how good it was I went for a look see.  If you are eating in there isn't much to get excited about besides the plasma TV on the back wall with ESPN news constantly running with no volume.  There is also no music or other background music, to me it felt a little weird, like I was eating at the library.    The food is very tasty.  Their chicken is all white meat which is very rare for an Asian food establishment, especially when they aren't charging extra for it. The spiciness can be adjusted to taste, from warm to sweat pouring into my eyes hot.   Lunch specials are filling with rice, entree, egg roll, and crab puff.  Dinner portions are sized up and again, very filling. Several vegetarian and health aware items on the menu.   They deliver to a pretty large area, and staff are friendly.  If you work or live in the area, support them as it would be a shame to see them go out of business.

This place is always slower than cold syrup.  It seems that this is more of a local social club than hair cut joint.  Today a lady came in and said that she had a 1:00 appointment (it was 1:10) and went in front of me after I had been waiting 25 minutes.  Then a lady came in and said  a 40 minute wait was too long and asked to make an appointment tomorrow.  She was told that they don't make appointments, it is first come first served.  Really?

I hate to hand out single star badges of honor on here, but this place deserves it.  When they first opened a review would have been 4 stars but lately the service from inside and wash staff drops it to one star.   The last 2 times we have taken our cars in they have not been very clean including them not even trying to vacuum out the back of my wife's SUV last time she was there.   To top it off when she went to pay with a coupon that can be printed off of their website at this moment they refused to accept the coupon saying that the prices have changed and we "need to deal with it".   Mind you this coupon has no expiration date on it and is currently active on the web.  We finally got a hold of a manager who was not to thrilled to correct the pricing error, and lastly they charged us for an extra quart of oil when their oil changes come with 5 quarts and according to the manual the engine holds just under 5 quarts.   Wont be going here again.

Café Rumba was one of my regular lunch spots until my office moved to Peoria, I do miss eating here.  It's tucked back in the corner of the lot which can make it difficult to find, but it appears that many of the locals have found it.   The food is fresh and prepared right in front of you ala Chipotle, but tastier than Chipotle.  They have several types of salsa which compliment the light and crispy chips nicely. My favorites were the chicken burrito, fish tacos (darn good with the white sauce on them), and the quesadilla with green chilies.   The staff is friendly and helpful, it is as if they enjoy working there, imagine that.  I hope this place makes it.

CLOSED.  They told the paper that the Glendale market is too difficult to be successful in.

I would recommend reading the reviews of the other locations and see how people are promised one thing when they sign up only to have it change when it is time to renew their contract.  Prices going up over $180 a year after being told their "price for life"  to being nickel and dimed to use separate pieces of equipment.  Do research!

OK but not fantastic food-at least in my opinion.  It is basic, quick, non americanized faire.  I would like to see the salsas perked up a bit but doubt that will happen as they havent been changed in years and years.

Update...went a few saturdays ago and the place was packed.  In fact we got the last non reserved table.  I had the stacked enchiladas which were very good but lacked the spice that the menu warned about.  My wife's burrito was also quite good, and my son loved the make your own nachos.  The highlight of the evening were the hot buttered tortillas.  You could make a meal of those alone.   The bad news- the service.  First we had to stand around while the hostesses first gabbed with some local wannabe rockstar hero, then when they got around to us they needed to look around and try to find a table.  When we said we didn't have reservations it was as if we somehow offended them. We waited over 25 minutes for our food to arrive and when t did get to us it wasn't piping hot as if it just came out of the oven.   Its not the traditional Mexican faire, and I am glad that it isn't.  I can only tolerate so many Garcia's, LaFonda's, etc.  I was glad to see that they are pushing several happy hour specials and have started weekend brunch and the occasional patio pig roast.    It appears that some of the initial excitement has died down but they are still bringing the people in, which is good-the area needs it.

I was there a while back  and the cashier (girl with long hair and glasses) was ringing me up and when I would swipe my card the would do something with her terminal like she was covering it then would tell me loudly as well as her friends that were hanging out around the stand making it hard to even get to the counter as they wouldn't move, that my card was declined.  This happened 3 times.  I thought it was strange as I had been shopping so I went to Paradise Bakery and guess what-it worked.  And it also worked the rest of my shopping.  Ok I thought no big deal they had issues.  A week or so later my wife asks me about Jamba Juice and she thought  that I didn't get anything.  I said I didn't and she showed me our statement with 3 charges on it. Gee, I wonder who signed and selected no receipt?  Not me, probably her when fiddling with the terminal.  I went to the Jamba Juice corporate website and submitted my story to them so they are aware, my bank took care of the charges.  I never heard back from anyone at Jamba.  This morning on our way to a track meet my daughter asked if we could get Jamba Juice, I told her no and instead took her to the locally owned juice shop to get a smoothie-and drafted this review as it came back to my memory.
