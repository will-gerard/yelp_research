Awesome place to drink, terrible place to eat. I have tried to give their food multiple chances but, I leave disappointed every time. However, the atmosphere and drink selection are perfect for a fun night out in Arcadia, just don't come hungry.

My boyfriend and I frequent Ling and Louie's quite often. The food is always great but the service is usually a little below average. The past few times we have visited the service has been exceptionally poor. Last night they were running a seasonal drink special.   It took about ten minutes to get our initial glass of water, which remained empty through out the meal due to the server not attending to us. The server recommended the drinks to us and it took 18 minutes to get the drinks to our table. By this time we already had our food. When the drinks arrived one was biter and we sent it back. The server assured us that it would be taken off the check and apologized.  When they brought out the check (10 minutes after we requested it) it still had the drinks on it. We waited ten more minutes for the server to come back to ask him to take it off. He never did and we paid and left. Needless to say we will not be going back to this location.

Echo coffee shop is everything I have ever dreamed of in a study spot. I order a hot almond milk latte (sometimes 2) each day when I study there. The atmosphere is mostly people doing work, which I love. The employees are friendly and prompt and deliver the latte to your table. Thanks for being great, Echo Coffee!

I just completed my first month at PB Phoenix and I am AMAZED at the changes in my body both physically and mentally.  I have always hated working out and I actually look forward to going to pure barre. I attend the early morning classes and wake up even earlier than I have to because I am so excited to go to pure barre. The girls there are SO nice and the studio is clean, chic and very welcoming. As a full time grad student and young professional it is hard to catch a break, but at pure barre I have found my personal time. Pure barre provides the mental benefits of yoga that I personally did not get from yoga. During pure barre I do not have time to think of the stress of the day- I am able to let go of my worries. I LOVE IT! It makes me so happy!!  Yes- it is expensive, but you cannot put a price on the results you get from pure barre. The instructors take time to make sure that you are using correct form and maximizing your time in the class. It is almost like having a personal trainer (which would essentially be a lot more expensive). The girls are not intimidating, they are patient and   SO helpful. I researched pure barre for a long time before I decided to spend the money and do it and my only regret is not starting sooner. I would highly recommend anyone who is looking to change their body and mind to try pure barre!

You can't beat the price/ taste of this sushi! This place is a hidden gem in PV. The staff is quick and very friendly. The Phoenix Roll is literally *to die* for. :)

I was fortunate enough to get a last minute appointment with Darlene for a gel pedi on a Saturday afternoon. Teres has a cute set up, is clean and has some awesome nail colors to chose from. It's not your typical nail place and the atmosphere is very upbeat. Darlene was funny, knowledgable and did an amazing job on my gel pedi! She was quick to the get the pedi done (important to me) but gave a nice long foot massage (even more important to me!). I would highly recommend this place and def ask for Darlene :)

If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered a chicken burrito and it came out cold! I get it- this happens. It wasn't what happened but how it was handled that bothered me. It took 15 minutes for our server to come back (after 3x of requesting him from bus boys/ explaining to them what happened) and when he came his reaction was very unprofessional. He did not apologize and ordered to MICROWAVE my burrito! I said no thanks and then he brought the check that included everything else but still no apology. Do not go to this restaurant because the service sucks.

"Subs so fast you'll freak"... What a joke! I placed a delivery order at 5pm and received a confirmation email that my order would be arriving to me shorty. An hour passed and I still had not received it so I called Jimmy John's and they told me my sandwich was en route and would be at my house in 10 minutes. Twenty minutes later I still had no delivery and called and canceled. I have never had any problems with any other Jimmy johns location and needless to say I will never order from 44th street location again.

This place has gone downhill. The gel overlay always chips and they are not accommodating to fix. I have gone to this place regularly for years and am so disappointed in the changes over the past few months.

I just left Joyride taco house and could not be more pleased with the food and exceptional service. I frequent Upward Project Restaurants and the service tonight was better than I could ever expect or have had! Justin was our server and he took great care of us! The chips and drinks were never short and the tacos we ordered were out of this world! I loved the carnitas, pork and shrimp tacos with the Asian slaw. The food was cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend Joyride to anyone interested in great tacos, awesome drinks and incredible service! To make your experience even more 5 star ask for Justin for your server!
