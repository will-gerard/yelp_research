Came here to get a mani, pedi, & wax... Brought my niece with me who by the way is 5... They charged me $30 for her to have a mani & pedi.. Sat down and Was gonna have my mani done, I picked out a few colors because I wanted a color combination on my nails and the tech tells me I need to CHOOSE 1 COLOR?? Then when I went to sit down to do my Pedi I told them I'm allergic to latex, so they refused to do my pedi.. I understand for sanitary reasons they don't want to do nails without gloves but should they make accommodations for those who are allergic to latex? Maybe buy NON LATEX GLOVES? then they say you pay now, so I paid but never offered to complete the rest of the services requested!!! Won't be coming back here and will make sure that everyone I know NEVER goes here. Worst experience ever. I would give them ZERO stars if that was an option!

Horrible service!!!! I don't even think they deserve 1 star.. Waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table, 20 minutes for drinks, 45 minutes for just an appetizer... Then another 30 minutes for my food, when they finally brought out the food you could tell that the food had been sitting under a heater or as the manager called it a "hot line." The there was hair in my food and all the manager did was say sorry. Said he would take care of it. Serious lack of communication because my server comes back and says oh did you still want that bread bowl!? Really?? Horrible

Love this place! Go here all the time and the ladies are so nice! This was the first restaurant we found when moving to this side of the valley and we have been extremely happy with both the service & food. We are never disappointed and we would recommend Golden Harvest to anyone!

It is my suggestion that you don't make a to go order.  I never got A receipt (what restaurant doesn't give you a receipt?) and I didn't get all of the items I ordered. When I called I was placed on hold for 5 minutes, someone came back and I had to start from beginning. So I asked to talk to a manager. Which may I say did not seemed genuinely concerned. I told him what happened, mind you I live 20mins from the restaurant and he said oh I'm sorry and 20 minutes is to far from you? Yes, it's 10:20 at night! I'm frustrated over the whole thing at this point! Uggggh. I was upset I have friends that live close that say great things and I had a bad experience!

Our server was great but the Kitchen failed miserably.... Ordered a Lumberjack slam with French toast and some well cooked hash browns... What I got was a Lumberjack slam with under cooked hash browns and soggy French toast, the ham was cold, the sausage was not fully cooked, and I didn't even get my toast! The waiter apologized as they were extremely busy. I didn't think it was his fault anyway, when I was pretty much done with my meal the waiter said my new side of French toast still was not done (bread was frozen). So he offered a free desert instead, which I thought was nice but then he brought it out and the fudge was all chunky... So needless to say the food was disgusting, but my server was nice. Wouldn't recommend it :( the server deserved stars for his service but the kitchen deserved negative 5 stars.

The 1 star is for the food the 4 missing is for the crappy service! I love the wings but they shorted me 4 wings, the server checked on our table maybe 3x, I asked for water and she took the cup and didn't come back! My husband had to get up and got get a cup of water himself. We asked for our check and it took her 15 minutes to bring over and didn't come back for another 15 minutes, didn't even get a pen to sign the check. The entire time she seemed like she hated her job and was here just for a check. Horrible service.
