Was looking for a good southern experience.  Food was ok nothing special.  Service was a little slow for only 5 people in the place. Was a little disappointed.

More than likely won't come back again.  Food is nothing special and service is slow.  Ask for some place settings and they brought one.  Clearly there is more than one person here.   Same with napkins.  Should not take 20 minutes for bar food.

This place is bad.  Don't want to work on your equipment unless you buy it from him.  The place is a joke.  Take your equipment someplace else.

I hate to say this but I don't this place is going to be around very long.  Service was horrific and the food isn't anything to brag about.  They have beers on the list  and menu but don't have them in stock.  They have no one at the front greeting guest.  We watched on several occasions people come in wait 10 minutes and then leave because know one would seat them.  The cook came out and said don't order the fries.  Another person came over and said who's order is this, i can't read the writing.  Wasn't even our order.   You better call restaurant impossible for this place.
