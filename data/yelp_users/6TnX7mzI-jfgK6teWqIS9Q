This is old-school Sonoran food. It's good! Hot sauce, chips, guacamole (though I think it has sour cream in it), enchilada sauce (both green and red), tacos, crispy cheese crisps, tasty medium-heat green chiles -- all good!   The only item that was lesser to my taste was the chile relleno, though the red tomato sauce on it was delicious.  Give it a shot. There's a reason why this restaurant has been successful for so long.

This is the real-deal Mexican food in Arizona. (Not to be confused with Rosita's local chain of restaurants.) Home-cooked goodness. Freshly cooked chips, spicy red and green salsa. Try the chicken chilie relleno or a green chili burro enchilada style.  For you meat purists, check out the sauteed beef burro or the carnitas burro(!). It's all soooo good - not a bad item on the menu. Go to Rosita's Place - you'll be glad you did.

Cold food (that should be hot) is the main problem. It was difficult to try to figure out what food was "hot enough" to be safe. I can imagine county health inspectors having a field day with a thermometer in there! The floor tile looked like a product of the 80's and appears grotesquely filthy. Another issue is that the Yelp $5 check in discount was not honored, despite asking two different folks. Service staff seemed quite disinterested in actually providing service. There was one gal who seemed to be more cheerful than the rest, but she was working another area. Would a welcoming smile and a "hello"kill ya??  I would much rather to to pacific seafood buffet for the same price.

If I ever get in an accident in front of this hospital, please take me to a different one. Too many bad stories to recount at this point with both my and wife's family. Not every employee is bad, but we've had way more than our fair share at this place. Had to fire doctors and nurses and had to advocate and raise hell to get things done. I have spent months in this hospital trying to help family members. Sometimes things just never get done. When a test is ordered and nothing happens for 3 or 4 days that's a bad sign. That's irresponsible and negligent. When it happens repeatedly it's a clear pattern of poor management and lack of accountability.  Multiple long waits (8-12 hours) in the ER room, unnecessary catheterizations, doctor prescribed drugs that were on the patient's allergy list and they were administered in ICU of all places! Uncaring nurse who wouldn't give immediate family an update and flippantly said she "wasn't worried" only to have the patient pass away hours later.  Unforgivable problems. 20 strikes and you're out Banner Desert!  Do your research. Pick a good hospital. There are some in town.

Monday morning, 9am: I came to recycle a toner cartridge and buy a custom rubber stamp. The sales associate in printing standard reply was "I don't know" to virtually all of my questions. No help at all - I gave up. I had to use the men's room and it had a filthy toilet, urinal that was near overflowed, broken faucet handle, paper towel and toilet paper rolls sitting on top of things instead of in the dispensers and a dead cockroach to top it off. I don't need to come back to this store. The manager needs to take a little pride!

Very casual family owned restaurant. Friendly staff and good food. Nothing here had ever knocked my socks off but the food is consistently good.  The shrimp platters are my favorite. For about $10 you get a scrumptious plate of food. I particularly like the baked shrimp dish with melted cheeses and green sauce. Delicious!

We've been fans of this mother and daughter operation for many years now. The Farmhouse is one of our favorite spots. The biscuits and gravy are the best we've had. The cinnamon rolls are a favorite, too. Chicken and dumplings on the Monday special is delicious. I have a friend who can't resist the meat loaf. When I feel like salad, the Cobb can't be beat. The friendly staff is great, too. Check it out!    There can be a wait sometimes. If you see people out front, just put your name on the list by the front door. Sometimes we'll drive by first to see what the wait is like. If it's non-existent or short, we'll stop. They're only open for breakfast and lunch.

Our favorite donut shop, hands down. We love that they also accommodate our special request orders when we call ahead the day before when we need a large order (like a few dozen of their crispy fritters or delicious buttermilk bars, etc.). Open 24 hours. Check it out!

I've brought every car I've had for the last 20 years to Car Cleaners. They have amazing attention to detail and their staff is always looking out for you. Just drop it off in the morning and they can usually get it out by evening. Bring your car in annually and it will look terrific the entire life of the car. My current car is 9 years old and is still a great looking car. My wife is always happy to get her car to Car Cleaners, too. Their leather cleaning/conditioning and interior work is amazing. Top quality products plus virtuosic expertise are a great combination! Also, if you're looking to sell a car, bring it here to get cleaned up and you'll fetch a better price and have an easier sell.  I know ... I've done it several times.  I wouldn't go anywhere else. Once you try it you won't either!

Great family restaurant!  Great food and holy horchata! Love the tacos and enchiladas. Burritos ain't bad either.  The gems of this place are the pastries and the horchata. Seriously. Save some room for dessert. And they have the best horchata in town. It even beats out Joyride Tacos, hands down! No contest...  They're not open for dinner so aim to get there before they close! Prices are a tad more than some places. About $10-11 a person, but we still love to go.

We've been fans since Joe's opened. Best BBQ in the valley. Pecan-smoked meats are sweet and succulent. Hungry first-timers should check out the Sampler Platter. If you're lucky enough to arrive on a rare day when they have their rib-tip sandwich available, be sure to check it out. It's amazing!

Yummy! Check out the 4B burger, onion rings, and a milk shake if your waistline is up to it! The BBQ chicken pizza or Carolina Dog is nice change of pace if you've sampled the rest of their menu. Note the homemade pickles! They have panko-breaded chicken tenders, too at a really good price.  If you're tempted by the ribs, I'd recommend getting them at Joe's Real BBQ instead. Good stuff.

This place has turned into Lifetime NURSERY AND DAYCARE. They don't care about member needs and seem to only want to cater to the needs of children and parents who want daycare services. This place should be an awesome fitness center - not a place to drop off kids for week(s) long camps that ruin the scene for everybody else. Want to use the basketball court? Too bad - it's reserved for kids. Want to use the racquetball courts? Too bad - they're being torn out for kids. The kids already have 5000 sq. feet of space in their own area!! Get your act together LTF!! Be a fitness center - not a DAYCARE!

Been once and won't return. It's friendly and trendy but lukewarm food, not enough spice, high prices and tiny portions don't combine for a fine experience. I would have had to order 3 entrees to leave full.

There's nothing amazing about the place except for scantily clad women and cold beer.  OMG did I just say that!??!  That said, the food is alright for an Irish themed sports bar. You will PAY for it though. Once you have a meal and add on a few (or dozen) beers onto the tab, you just might suffer sticker-shock.   The Irish thing is done better at Fibber McGees.   I wish I could give 2.5 stars, because that's where they're at in my book. If the prices were better, I'd up the rating.

The food isn't very good, I'm afraid. I wish it was because we live around the corner.  The chicken was "sticky" and I had to pull my mouth apart to continue chewing because my teeth were temporarily stuck together with each bite. Calamari was tough and extraordinarily bland. Salad was small, but ok.  The marinara sauce was pretty good. The service was mediocre but polite. The ambience is lacking. At $20 a plate I was thoroughly unimpressed. The kids didn't eat much of their meals.  I hate to say that I would have rather went to a chain restaurant, because that's not my usual way, but a chain would have kicked Calabria's butt the night we went. I'm sorry to leave a poor review because I usually want family businesses to succeed. Maybe we just ordered the wrong 5 dishes and caught them on a bad night but we're not eager to return.

Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Don't forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular. If you haven't checked it out, you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends.

They have freshly-cooked good food and large portions. We like supporting a friendly family business. Favorites of ours: General Cho's chicken, moo shoo, egg foo young, BBQ ribs. We need to try more dishes, though! Not much in the way of ambience. We'll usually eat in for lunch but get take out in the evenings. Lunch specials are a really good value and opportunity to check this place out for only $5 to $7 including soup or drink.

JP isn't my #1 breakfast stop but I felt I needed to put in my two cents after seeing some pretty harsh reviews. I think it's a decent pancake place. I've been there twice and received good service both times. One time they stayed open a little later so me and a pal could eat. The menu states that their special 'baked pancakes' take 20 minutes to prepare, so if you ordered one of those, be prepared to wait :) I've ordered the griddle pancakes with bananas and nuts. I thought they were filling and yummy! The next time I go I want to check out the baked pancakes. Don't be afraid to check it out for yourself - I think it easily beats the pancakes you'll get at the breakfast chains (ihop, dennys, etc).

Tried the tacos and their unique quesadillas. Two thumbs up - though my waistline might not appreciate too many of those fried quesadillas, lol. They'll have to be a treat - not a regular thing for me.  Their salsa bar is a lot of fun. Be prepared to spend some time sampling all of them.  Gotta love the dia de los muertos decorating. Unique!

Service is terrible. We go different Yogi's around town a LOT. My kids like to eat the krab meat, so at every Yogi's we go to, we just order them a side of krab. THIS location wouldn't sell us an order of krab meat. I was in disbelief and thought that surely the gal had simply not understood my request, but her fellow order taker concurred that I couldn't. I was forced to order an Arizona Bowl (krab meat on top of rice) and when I made the innocuous request to put the krab meat into a separate bowl, I was DENIED. Whoever is running this place blows monkey nuts. You can keep your krab meat, you inflexible moron!

I've shopped at this location maybe 8-10 times. We've always had mediocre to good service, but  the last two times have been unsatisfactory. A few days ago all my sale items would not ring up at the sale price at the register. The cashier said they would ring up automatically, but they obviously didn't. She was less than courteous and sat there rolling her eyes and seemed to blame me for their problem. It's not my fault their stuff doesn't work! Upon trying to correct the prices (after her associate walked all over the store to verify I was correct) she rang up an item twice and I had to correct her again. When I left there was no 'sorry for the trouble', no 'have a nice day' or even a nod. Just a blank stare and not a word. I was not impressed.  Today I went to return two of the five items and I was told that I couldn't receive a full refund of WHAT I PAID for the items because I used a frequent shopper $10 reward certificate. They shorted me about $4.  Four bucks isn't a big deal in my life, but that's some crappy service if you ask me. I could understand if my purchase was less than $10, but it was for $132.  My wife just told me that last month she used another $10 reward certificate to buy my daughter a pair of shoes.  She ended up having to exchange the new unworn shoes for the identical shoe in a different size.  She was asked to pay $5 to make the exchange! WHAT?!? This is how they treat their loyal customers?  I guess our family won't have to worry about the frequent shopper reward certificates any more, because Dick's has turned out to be aptly named as far as I'm concerned. I'm done with them.

Order up the meal for two: 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips & salsa, and 4 beers! (soda is optional but not recommended, lol just kidding!). Split a side of healthy (but yummy) lard-free beans and don't forget a couple roasted jalapeños for a little heat. Good stuff!

We quit going to this place a couple years ago when they blamed my wife's braking skills (lol) for the 2-day failure of their crappy brake pads. They machined the rotors as part of the brake job, but pieces of the new disc pads were crumbling and falling off. I took the vehicle back and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how much of the pads had disintegrated and was completely taken aback when the manager claimed it was my wife's driving causing the pads to fail.  Maybe they're better now, but my experience was crappy parts and crappy excuses.

I popped in a few minutes before closing time and grabbed two carnitas tacos. I was pleasantly surprised. The tacos were of good size, the meat was of good quality and it was a tasty meal. They had green and red hot sauce - both were tasty, but without a lot of heat, which was fine for that evening. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes.

As a native Arizonan and Mexican food lover I don't dig this place at all. I mean, it looks great and has nice patios but the food and prices are lame. Our waiter couldn't answer questions about the food. Simple questions, even. The rice is the blandest Mexican rice I've had and the beans are overwhelmed by an artificial bacon and liquid smoke flavor. The chips were passable but the red salsa was impotent and the green sauce tastes like it's half sugar. I had a pork burro, and the meat was of good quality but flavorless not to mention they put the same bad-tasting beans into the burro too, which was not mentioned on the menu. And $8 for a 10" cheese crisp? C'mon. In this town, you don't have to drive far to get good Mexican food at a good price but you will have to drive past this place. Sorry.

This is a nice little spot. Homemade New Mexican style food is done well. Red sauce, green sauce, meats are all good. My usual meal here the past 5 or 6 visits has been the two enchilada plate. I like the pork with green sauce and beef with red. The chips are good. 3 different salsas to choose from, all with different characters to enjoy.  I don't understand why people give a 1 star review because they don't serve breakfast past a certain time or they have plastic utensils. I know it's a bummer if you wanted chorizo or something, but the food here is good regardless of what time you come. Counter employee changes are fairly frequent but I've never had any issues. $7-9 for a big plate of flavorful homemade food is a good value to me.  My family enjoys it and we've brought other families here and they're now regulars too. It's also one of the only places around to get good fry bread if you're into it.  Los dos Molinos and Richardson's aren't in this immediate area but NMG holds it's own in an easy and casual, value-oriented way. Yummy!  Check it out if you haven't been here. Hopefully you'll enjoy it, too!

Only been here once. I didn't know this was a chain out of CA or anything. I just wanted a burger. I had no expectations.  Overall, our party was pleased. I can understand some of the comparisons to In-n-Out but I think I actually like this place better simply because they have more variety on the menu.  That's NOT a knock on In-n-Out, they simply don't have anything outside of burgers, fries, and shakes. Does somebody in your party like bacon, a different kind of sandwich, salad, or onion rings? Can't go to In-n-Out...  The quality of the food was good. Everything was hot, fresh, and tasty. We had charburgers, sweet potato fries, regular fries. No issues with anything. Not a bad deal as far as I'm concerned.  You can tell they're a little heavy on the corporate style right now in order to keep things going in the right direction with the new location, but it wasn't offensive to me, despite what appeared to be a high number of people appearing to be 'supervising'. Service was good. We'll be going back.

This is a brand new buffet. They seem to be doing things right here. They cook in small portions so the food is fresher than most of the competition. I appreciate that they do this. There's a huge selection including a limited sushi offering that was acceptable to me. The kids enjoyed the wide variety of dishes, as did I. We each found things that we enjoyed and the quality of the food was better than most. Favorites of ours included a lightly fried shrimp in a sweet creamy sauce. It was tasty. There's bound to be something that you'll enjoy. Mongolian BBQ, a selection of soups, salads, desserts and ice cream are all included. Lunch was $8.99 (I think) for adults. Prices for kids was according to how tall they are. I thought that was humorous. It was clean and well-tended. Check it out if you're hungry...

If you're in the mood for froyo, do yourself a favor and check this family business out.  We've been here a few times and have been greeted by friendly staff with little sample cups so we can try out a new flavor or two before filling up our bowls.  So far the caramel is the family favorite. I also noticed they had a flavor of yogurt that sported even fewer calories than regular frozen yogurt. I had to check it out and I thought it tasted great!  Of course, I ended up restoring the missing calories by spooning some chocolate bar goodness into my bowl...  It was worth it.  They've got a multitude of toppings and run special discounts on certain days. On one day they'll cut you a discount if you ride or bike to the store. I thought that was pretty cool.  We'll be back!

This ain't no chain, folks! You can tell 'cuz this place is off the hook!  Delicious yogurt with favorite and creative flavors from the grand mix-master himself, "Cool Funky D". Grab the kids and grandparents and head over for a delicious cool treat. You won't be disappointed!  C'mon, seriously, why are you still reading? Get in the car already!  :)

I dig this place. I love the thin crust crispy deliciousness and this place fits the bill. They have a variety of prepared recipes and you can create your own masterpiece if you choose. There are a lot of different sauce and topping options. They have fresh mozzarella and several other kinds of cheese. For an eight dollar pizza you can't do better than this. Not in this town, anyway. They also have four different kinds of brewed iced tea. which is cool.  Check it out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Don't forget to order it extra crispy!

I hate to update with a negative review but my meal and the service I received this evening sucked. My pizza arrived but it was cold because it wasn't cooked long enough. I even talked to them and they offered to remake the pizza....which came back with cold ingredients and unmelted cheese a second time. Wtf? Two tries and you can't leave a pizza in the oven long enough to melt the cheese? And it took waaaay too long to get it remade. My slow-eating kids were finished long before I got my new (but once again room temperature) pizza.  There's usually an older and younger African American couple here (father and son, maybe?) who always took really good care of us and produced fantastic pizzas but they weren't here tonight.   What a disappointment! This visit took away all of my enthusiasm for the joint.

After my last not so happy review, Fred sent me a message with an apology and promise to remedy the problem. He also offered to send a gift card that never arrived but whatever.   So at the insistence of the rest of my family we've been back a couple times to this location. Even though the same fella who ruined two consecutive pizzas for me in the past was still baking, he did a good job these recent times. I was very pleased to see the improvement.  We also stopped in at the new location downtown at the Collier center and they're still working out the kinks with some less experienced staff. I ended up with a soggy mediocre pie and made a quick mention to the manager. She offered to remake, but we were already running late for the Suns game. Hopefully she can get things squared away soon. It is a good value for a good pizza when they get it right. Sucks when they don't. Consistency is key!

Stop on in! You'll get a nice haircut with a friendly and talented barber. He's big on basketball which is something I'm always happy to talk about. The shop just opened but he's a multi-generational barber with over 20 years experience.  He's got a couple nice tv's (one is huge!), soft drinks, water, and perhaps even a cold brew if you're in need. He's a hard-working guy and his efforts show. Do yourself a favor and check his place out!

As a long-time believer in the benefits of massage, I feel very fortunate to have found OneSelf. I've been getting massages for about 15 years. Sometimes I want a massage for relaxation, but more often I'm looking for relief of problems related to being hard on my body and my unrelenting gym schedule. For almost a year, the work I get done at OneSelf has been keeping me going. The aches, pains, muscle weakness/tightness from working out and playing sports will move around from place to place on my body but OneSelf is always able to provide relief.   Their membership deal is also the best in town! For a mere $50 annual fee you get access to drastically reduced prices for yourself and gift certificates. The membership at OneSelf is truly a value especially when you consider the quality of work they do compared to the other membership places. These massage therapists are experienced and they have a philosophy guiding them. They work hard to fix YOUR issues and have the knowledge to improve your ailments.  If you are as much as a fan of the benefits of massage as I am you owe it to yourself to make an appointment asap. Tell them what you need and they'll find solutions.  They're also offering yoga now, which is cool. You can schedule a session for just before or after your massage then you can straighten out your mind and body in the same visit!  Give it a shot! I bet you'll feel benefits after your first visit!
