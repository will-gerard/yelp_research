Freaking ridiculous! After waiting an hour yesterday and being told i had too many iOS updates on my iPad which isn't even a year old they "fixed" it and I went home. Had the same exact problem today so I went back to only be told I had to wait 2 hours or make an appointment for 3 days out. Are you kidding me!?! Worst customer care ever!!!!

Yesterday i got a call from daycare that my son was in hysterics because his ear hurt. I called and was told to come down and they would work us into Dr. Brewster's schedule. My little guy was cried all the way to the office, while checking in and waiting. We did not wait longer than 5 minutes before getting called which was probably a relief to everyone in the waiting room lol. Dr. Brewster was personable, gentle and kind during my son's exam. He even chuckled when my son self diagnosed an ear infection. (He was right btw)

The staff is absolutely wonderful from the office to the coaches. Our son (age 6) has thrived on their preteam and has become more aware of healthy vs unhealthy activities and foods. He loves the summer camp program and thinks coach Jeremiah is AWESOME! We even have used the Parents Night Out which was inexpensive and he thought it was so fun it was hard to drag him out of the building lol. There might be less expensive options but I really doubt there is better.

Completely underwhelmed by the whole experience. We saw Goldilocks and the Three Bears today.  $17 for a 45 minute experience (15 mins of songs only good for the preschool set and rules - 30 minute show) was a bit pricey.  The seating was extremely uncomfortable.  There were no backgrounds or impressive props. Done on a black curtain backdrop and only 3 bowls, 3 chairs and 3 headboards.  Only 5 puppets used and it was obviously all done by a single person.   My child could have done this at home.   All in all there is no GREAT at The Great Arizona Puppet Theater in my opinion.

We had an early lunch (the club hit the spot!) and we received great service from Shay.  We sat at the counter and can attest that she is a team player in every way...saw her plate food, run food, communicate with her manager about tables and just generally hustle. Which was great since the place was surprisingly packed. The missing star was for the host that had no idea what tables were open so a big line occurred which mingled with the people trying to pay because he seemed to be doing it by himself. The server that was reading the menu to someone on the phone and then just saw the line and walked away. An acknowledgement or a "hey guys I'm going to go get someone to help out up here" would have been nice.

Quick...easy...good price. Digging the chicken parm...the kid is happy with the cheese. The guy behind the counter hasn't cracked a smile once since we have been here. Lol

Yes the prices are good. Yes I got right in. Yes it is clean. Yes my stylist was nice and friendly. At this point you are probably saying well what's with the 2 star rating?!?  I did not get the cut I asked for.   It is that simple. I spent the last year growing out my hair. It had finally gotten just past my shoulders. I went in with a picture of Nicole Richie with a long bob and heavy side bang. All the way around it was below her chin but above her shoulders. This cut would not get me in trouble with my husband....which is why I picked it. I usually am not the type to freak out if a little more is taken off then intended. HOWEVER, this is a different matter altogether. Somehow I ended up with an A-line Bob with layers...the shortest of the layers is about eye level. She had cut off a good half foot of hair to make this layer btw. It is now going to take another year for me to be able to grow this out to what will still only be a nub of a ponytail. I know you are asking why did I not stop her? Well...The front was still long enough (past my chin) to not worry me and I thought it was the guide. I WAS WRONG.  There was no sense causing a scene....what was done was done. It is not like they could give me my hair back. I just want to warn everyone to be very watchful as they are cutting your hair.  And now I am going to be the girl I have never been and finish my cry.

I yelped before and got a response from Great Clips within 2 days however I just sent the following to the corporate office.  About 2 months ago I Yelped a horrible experience and I contacted you directly.  I was impressed that I got a response so quickly from a corporation.  I was told to expect a gift card in order to use your services again.  I even checked on it with the store manager a month in because I was going to take my son for his back to school cut. I was not going to go again but I was going to continue my patronage with both my husband and children because mens haircuts do not seem to be a problem.  I however never received a gift card and my saved impression of your company is now once again in the toilet.  I am appalled by the lack of follow through.

They just don't listen. Gave what I thought were very specific instructions. -I want it to stay long on top and shorter in the sides and back. -This is his cowlick it spins out do not take this hair and try to make it comb down it will just go forward and look like he cut one piece himself. -(pushed the front of his hair into his eyes) this just needs to be brought up to eyebrow length. -he has natural curls/wave so you have to be careful of length. -he does not part his hair (another cowlick issue) I do not want him to be able to do a Donald trump comb over.  Never were the words shorter all over on top, layered, feathered, thinned etc used.  What he got was the typical little boys first haircut that you see on all toddlers. He is 7.  It is short all over, if you comb it forward he has bangs (middle forehead bangs), uneven neckline etc.  Why did I not stop it? Well I didn't see the first cut on top...I saw the next being lined up and by that time it was too late. I did say something and things got really awkward. She went and got books but the cut I wanted was no longer possible because he didn't have the long top. Almost got his haircut like his dad's but then we were going to have to wait another 6-9 months for it to grow out and go through all the awkward stages. I got frustrated and just wanted out. They tried to not let me pay for the cut because they knew it was bad. But that made me feel like more of an asshole so I dropped a $20 and got out of there.    Well, first time shame on them...second time, shame on me.   Took our son in and walked through what we wanted. We have been getting his little curls back for months and the INCOMPETENT inbreds here do the exact opposite and decide to do what they want!  Our son was crushed.   So over it but it's a corporate chain and they don't give a shit so whatever. Just review the rest of the very accurate yelps and spend the extra 10 minutes to drive somewhere else.

Whoever is driving down Bell road right now in your truck is reckless and a danger to other people including my family in the car!  Weaving in and out of traffic and literally went through a red light that everyone else was stopped at. You should probably have a bit more respect while driving a company car!!

This is the home of my favorite salad the Pear Gorgonzola. Yum! But 2 things happened today...first they have changed the pear to Apple  and then they botched my to-go order.  I ordered my salad with chicken and when I got home there was NO chicken! At $16 for a salad I was a little miffed at the takeout fail so I called the restaurant and immediately am put on hold  Finally I got to speak to Sean the manager in duty who was more than nice about what happened. I paid in crash so I didn't get the credit but I do get my salad free next time

So earlier this week Picazzos let me down in my takeout order but redeemed my experience by my conversation with the manager Sean. I tried again tonight and it was another epic fail. First, my son's Buttery Parmesan Cheesy Linguini was not very buttery and had no apparent cheese. Second, they forgot the milk (included with kids meal). Finally, what makes me super angry and disappointed is the fact that I was told to come have the salad of my choice "on them" but it was not in fact "on them". I get the same salad every time Apple Gorgonzola with extra nuts and dressing. I was charged for both the chicken and the nuts.     Old review:  This is the home of my favorite salad the Pear Gorgonzola. Yum! But 2 things happened today...first they have changed the pear to Apple  and then they botched my to-go order.  I ordered my salad with chicken and when I got home there was NO chicken!

This is a place that you need to make a regular spot.  There is so much to try and build everytime you come in or you can stick to what you love.  Keep it up Stax team!!!

Our son, Brody went here regularly for a year. He was extremely happy here as we were having him go. The teachers have always been amazing. We recently had to move to LA and there is NOTHING close to what they offer!  If your questioning wether or not to use this facility, don' hesitate!!  Your child will be in great hands.     Please expand to Pasadena!!  We miss you!!!

Was worried what type of first experience we would have here since it was Easter but shouldn't have. It was noon when we walked in after church and were greeted by a friendly hostess in bunny ears  we were sat immediately and greeted promptly by a wonderful server named Frankie. She was nice, fast and helpful. The muffins were awesome and we had a solid breakfast (kids chocolate chip pancakes and a breakfast quesadilla). Love the make your own Bloody Mary/mimosa bar. It was the visit from the Easter bunny that sealed the deal! He made our sons while day! Thank you Z Tejas we will be back!

Tonight was our first and last trip here. Why?  1. Very limited kids menu 2. Walked in and there was a haze of smoke from the kitchen. Was surprised the fire alarm wasn't going off. 3. Bathroom was gross and all of the grout had been turned yellow due to neglect/smoke/grease. 4. Fellow diners were a sketchy bunch. 5. Over cooked meat and waffle fries that were like biting into cooled grease. 6. Awful stomachache from eating 1 rib, side Caesar salad and a few waffle fries.

Been members for about a month ... Having buyers remorse...why you ask?     1.even if I'm physically in the shallow pool w/ my son if there isn't a lifeguard we get thrown out. 2. From around 11:15am-4pm   1/2 The child care amenities are closed (tubes, basketball, outside etc) oh and I have yet to see the attendants play or organize the children into any type of activity (not even to read them a book) 3. They decided to change my child's swim lesson time/teacher/day and I really had no choice 4. Today my husband and I came on for our massage appt only to be told we weren't on the books. My husband has very little time off work and was really looking forward to this. They found an appt for a week later at that time but didn't have our name right. And it was of course after the intro offer was over....convenient.  Thanks Life Time.

Wish I could give zero..  Sons kindergarten graduation today and of all things, he wanted a chocolate dipped cone from McDonald's.   We order them and about 8 minutes later, I ask where the cones are. The 12 year old at the counter says oh... Then asks his manager to make them because he "hates" making them.... DO YOUR JOB YOU SPOILED POS!!!!  After the child wins that battle... The rest of the team was so incompetent, that no one could dip a cone into chocolate to get it done.  Because no one has the iq of dead cockroach...they asked if we wanted something else. Said no and let the wife deal with it. Ridiculous and embarrassing....

First and last visit today. One word sums up the experience...UNDERWHELMING. There are so many other breakfast options that are better (the Good Egg, Perk, Scramble...hell even IHOP is better) I'm just saying.

Huge trench mud hole is the only down side. Dogs and people are friendly. There is a fountain for the pups, plenty of poop bags and a few stray balls to play with

Came for an open session to try a parkour clinic for our 7 year old. ($20 for 4 hours) I'm up in the gallery watching and he is having the best time and feeling so accomplished (he just ran up the big wall to the top without help...for someone that is all of 43 inches tall that is a huge deal...literally). He has also bounced in the trampolines, played on the gymnastics equipment, watched the skaters in the pipe and is now playing dodgeball. Why does this place have to be 35 minutes away?! We need need need this is North Phoenix/ North Scottsdale! In all this is a little boys paradise.

Thank you Erica L for a great first TR experience! She was amazingly friendly and helpful.  My very picky eater of a son loved Fresh rolls with cinnamon butter The kids steak The ribs (he ate mine) Steak fries *not a fan of the corn because he tasted pepper  He adored being able to shuck the peanuts and put them in the floor.  He also got a kick out of watching the staff dance to cotton eyed joe. I loved that my very tasty frozen sangria margarita  was very reasonably priced at $7 He just asked to have his bday dinner here lol!

This place is in the neighborhood we moved into a few months ago and when we saw the groupon we figured why not?! Just tried to go for an early dinner and what a bust. Yes it was busy due to kids eat free however it was easy to see what is wrong with this place. The host misquoted a wait time (10 mins) as we sat there for 20 minutes we literally saw 4 open tables that servers/bussers/the host just kept walking by and not picking up dirty dishes or cleaning those tables. The servers that couldn't bother to help bus their tables so they could turn them had no problem picking up their check presenters btw. The host also had more than enough time to bs with one of his buddies. "We're busy as shit wanna help?" Needless to say we left and grabbed a pizza at Papa Murphys instead and subsequently cancelled our Groupon. Such a disappointment on so many levels.

I love that they have an orientation/review of your dog BEFORE you can actually have them stay there. Our dog was happy at pick up from both the orientation and his first stay (he had never been left at a boarding facility in his 12 years). The price was reasonable. They have a back yard situation so you know they aren't in a kennel all day. We packed more than enough food for his 24 hour stay but didn't get any of it back. This is probably the only negative. (And yes we know he didn't eat it all he fell into his bowl at home like he had never seen a meal LOL.)  oh and we got an adorable pic to boot during his day...this made us less worried.

Our highlights included: -yummy tot- chos  -extensive beer list that had an awesome grapefruit shandy -great service (attentive/friendly/knowledgeable/helpful for first timers) by Amber -deal on yelp for $5 off our bill We enjoyed ourselves so much we purchased the six-pack for the back of the house staff. Btw kudos to the owners/management for a way for patrons to acknowledge the kitchen staff!
