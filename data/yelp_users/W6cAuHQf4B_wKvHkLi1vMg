I love me some Trader Joe's!!! This one is located next to a Whole Foods and as much as I love WF, I know TJ's must get more action here.  Excellent prices on produce and pantry items, and this location sells spirits! Woot!!!!   Great selection of TJ's brand juices and they always have organic chicken drumsticks on sale for $1.99 a pound.  Can't beat it!

The state of this mall is just unfortunate. Many of the shops were closed, and it wasn't very busy. A few stores had signs indicating the staff would be right back in 10 or 15 minutes. The kids play area was nice and colorful. There are some big name retailers there that were in really nice condition that I was surprised to see- Sears, Torrid, Bath and Body Works, Verizon, Sprint, Charlotte Russe and Journeys.  Some of the other stores weren't very well stocked.   One thing that really surprised me and that may be worth a visit is their pet adoption center! I saw volunteers walking dogs and playing with the rescues which was really sweet. A very odd place for a rescue organization, but a respectable mission nonetheless.

Uh-mazing!!!!! This is like Dollar Tree only with an elaborate grocery section. It's Dollar Tree on steroids!!!   Strawberries for $.99?! Bolthouse farm juices for $.99? Evol breakfast sandwiches for $.99? Party decorations, hair supplies, produce, household supplies, healthy/nutrition conscious drinks and thangs for $.99?! Man oh man! I have GOT to find me one of these stores up in DFW!!!!  Staff are friendly and check you out quickly. Low priced popular brands is enough reason to make a visit.   Great way to save money on your groceries and household items!

What a neat Goodwill! On Thursdays certain colored ticketed items are $1.50! The store is vast, with racks neatly organized by gender and then type of clothing item and size. Like colors are grouped together as well. The dress selection is pretty good if you don't mind spending $10. I found two adorable J. Crew dresses in excellent condition. J. Crew!!!!   They have a nice book section as well. Cookbooks and textbooks galore. The furniture section was awesome! Some items were a DIYer's dream, and there were some items that were in great condition!   I found a pair of Kendra Scott earrings in the jewelry section for $3.99!!! If you buy jewelry you ask for it at the front and then they hold it for you until you are ready to check out.   As with any goodwill, there are items that are largely overpriced. A colorful Coach handbag was $39.95. Ridiculous and I don't care how much it retails for. But if you take the time to look you will find some great items!

Amazing, amazing, amazing! Like Subways for pizza but on a whole 'nother level!!!!   $7.95 for an 11-inch pizza (they have gluten free for $2 more) and you can customize as you wish, there's no up charge for certain ingredients. They also have salads, you can customize or choose one of their recipes.  The ingredients were high quality. I saw some dried meats up on there and not only did they have regular mozzarella, hey had fresh mozzarella AND fontina!   Lots of great veggies from a pinch to fresh tomatoes to artichokes to sweet peppers. They are generous with the cheese and everything else is sprinkled evenly.  And that crust though! It looks thin and quite unassuming, but puffs, crisps up, and folds up beautifully! It looks like they bake it in a brick oven!   So good and so yummy! Would be a frequent visitor if one of these was in DFW!
