Seriously have tried this bar several times as they sponsor our kickball league.  But the service and the wait staff are the absolute worst. They act like they are doing you a favor to take your order and if you get your order at all.  Won't be back any time soon

The service at this place is great however the food is horrible and incredibly over priced. So disappointing. Oreganos is right across the street. Save your money and go there.

I moved into an older townhouse with single paned windows that mostly faced West.  I looked around for a company to tint my home windows and found Scott from Veteran Tinting and Blinds here on Yelp.  I got a quote from him and was really impressed with the service he was going to provide. Very friendly, no pressure and very informative.  He came and tinted my whole house, every window.  He did a fantastic job.  He went over all the options with me, and made me feel comfortable with my choice of tint. By the time he was done tinting the windows, it felt like a whole new house!!  All the heat is no longer radiating off the windows, and I can open the blinds and see my awesome mountain views now!!  I highly recommend Scott and Veteran Tinting and Blinds.  I'm a tough customer, and if he was able to make me happy, he is doing something right!!

Third time coming here and seriously never coming back.  The wait staff is pretentious and rude and work at a snails pace.  The food is actually decent if they get your order right, which never happens.  They also have mandatory valet even when the place is dead.  Save your frustration and go to any of the other great places in the area.  This place blows!!!!

This place has a great look and excellent beer and wine selection.  Prices are very reasonable and the staff is very friendly.  No attitude here!!  Will definitely be back again to relax and enjoy my new favorite spot.  Great Saturday wine bar stop!!

Ok so they redid this bar and added a full kitchen.   I was surprised how well they did with the remodel. It's classy, cool and great art work of local artists displayed.  So we ordered a burger and a salad to split.  Best burger EVER.  NO JOKE.   My new favorite hangout for sure!!   Love this place!!!
