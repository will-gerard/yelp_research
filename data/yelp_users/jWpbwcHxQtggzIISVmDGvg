Awesome lunch spot! Very fresh foods, you can tell exactly what you're eating.  Even the fruit salad looks made fresh daily (and its not your usual melon and cantaloupe mix).  Their menu is healthy to begin with, but you can also ask for their Simply 500 menu and see all their options with 500 or fewer calories. The Greek chicken pita is huge and only 460 calories...delicious!

We are new to the area and a lot of people kept telling us to check out Postino.  We finally were able to on a Thursday around 7:30.  The place was cool, I liked the vibe, BUT do not go here if loud music bothers you because they are definitely cranking it.  The fig/prosciutto bruschetta and the tomato jam with sheeps cheese were our favorite!

Stopped in for a piece of carrot cake to go.  Not impressed. The icing was very heavy on butter and the cake was extra oily,  presumably to keep it most for longer.  However,  I will come back and try their food and then update my review... But for now,  skip the cake!

This place is legit. Usually I think places with a lot of reviews tend to be overrated, but this place passed with two thumbs up.   The pancakes are delicious and the bacon is thick and flavorful. My mom had an omelet and said it was nothing spectacular,  yet she really enjoyed the potatoes.

Went of a Friday night for the first time and had a very enjoyable experience. My husband and I arrived at 7pm and had about a twenty minute wait for a table.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for the good quality ingredients.  There was a special going on if you buy a Kirin you get a 99 cent appetizer.  The sashimi was great too. We also had a 'tootsie roll' which was very good, and a 'Boston roll' which we probably would not get again.  It was just a Cali roll with tuna on top - meh. But overall it was a great night. We will be back for sure!

Horrible customer service! I tagged along this afternoon to my husbands 1:15 tee time and they charged me a rider's fee of $17... Just to sit in his cart and watch. He was a single player so it's not like we needed an extra cart or anything!  For that price I could have just played! Ridiculous.  Won't be back.

I feel bad for the people who get suckered into this place after seeing their photoshopped pictures online.  This place is on par with a Days Inn, and is by no means a resort.  My issue was the ownership and staff.  If you want to feel like you are the biggest inconvenience to walk through the front door, then this is your place! Also, I have no idea how their gym survives. They discourage gym-only membership and the fees are ridiculous ($549 initiation fee, plus $100 monthly fee).  I guess that's why the place is completely dead. Oh well, the equipment is old anyways.    Anyways, this place is a big NOPE! Nope nope nope

I had to struggle to justify my two-star rating, but my vegetables were okay and there was also plenty of parking...  yeah, that's how horrible this place was.  My group had reservations for a Sunday at 12:30.  We had 9 people, so we took up an entire table to ourselves. The service was painfully slow from this point on.  We saw our waiter in 15 minute intervals, and he would always rush off before making sure we had everything we needed.  And this was BEFORE the chef even started cooking.  We didn't even see our chef until 1:20... almost an entire hour of waiting at the table!  Soup and salad doesn't take THAT long to eat......   Benihana used butter and soy sauce as their two flavorings.  Everything tasted the exact same and was so, so plain.  I was hoping for more of a teriyaki flavor for at least my chicken.  Also, the dipping sauces aren't good either, so you're basically stuck with really bland food that's been drenched in butter.   Also, if you have kids, they probably will be underwhelmed as well. This place is no-frills due to a few lawsuits (that is what our chef said).  What fun is teppanyaki without FIRE?! The only "trick" they do is an onion train thing.    There are better, locally owned teppanyaki restaurants in town.  We definitely won't ever be back...ever.

Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back.

You might drive by and think this is just another average liquor store, but no! My co workers wanted to go here after work and I was very surprised and pleased with this place. Awesome selection upstairs, but go down into the cellar to enjoy a drink yourself.  Staff was very friendly and attentive. Great selection. They even have a little room in the back for gatherings.  But one thing...GO wildcats :) ... I had to.

One of my favorite lunch spots in Downtown Mesa.  It is SO cute! I used to go solely for the coffee and specialty drinks, but recently I tried their menu.  The food is so surprisingly tasty, fresh, and healthy.    My favorite sandwich is the Old Town Club.  It has a raspberry chipotle spread on it that really kicks the flavors up a notch.  The Bungalow Beef and Gobble it Up are also great sandwiches.  The sides that come with the sandwiches could use a little work... I usually order the potato salad and it is literally maybe two tablespoons of it inside a tiny plastic ramekin.   You can eat it in one forkful :)

The bagels are actually very good, but it seemed awfully expensive... We had two bagels toasted with cream cheese and it was $7! Like other reviewers mentioned, they don't show their prices so who knows what the heck I actually got charged for.  I'd like to come back, but seriously...add prices to your menu!!

Warning! Do not take your clothes here!! I read some of their bad yelp reviews beforehand and now I'm kicking myself in the ass that I didn't listen.  They managed to DESTROY three of the five blouses I dropped off... I'm talking like ripped beading and discoloration from their stupid garment press.   They are all about the money and don't care if they lose customers because their cheap prices seem like such a steal. It's not worth it when you end up having to buy a new work wardrobe.

My husband and I were really impressed with this little place!  I'm kind of surprised to read he run negative reviews because our experience was quite the opposite.  Flavorful food, fun drinks, accommodating staff, awesome atmosphere.  Best of all, very minimal Scottsdale douche-baggery!  We can't wait to go back!

This place is seriously overrated.  Food is good, but not great.  I think something that bothers me the most is the attitude we got from the staff...as if we were an inconvenience. Yeah buddy, I hate when customers come into my restaurant and give me money too....  Anyways, you can get much better Italian elsewhere!

It gets 5 stars compared to other breweries I've been to. Great beer, good service, and surprisingly tasty food.  Even if you aren't a beer person, it's worth checking out for the atmosphere and food! And yes it's mostly street parking, but it's not frustrating at all :)

Even though it kills my husband that I order it, their $10 'fancy' grilled cheese sandwich is amazing.  Not crazy about the garlic fries like everyone else though... They will make you sweat garlic for a week.  Really good beers too.

Sooo much self loathing going on after eating here. Thank god for sweatpants and Tums.  This place is super gimmicky and the food was not good.  I couldn't believe the amount of people packed in here for subpar Mexican.  The portions are huge, which I guess is a plus for some... But I'd much rather have quality over quantity.

Awesome gelato, awesome location, friendly employees.  I would highly recommend the salted caramel flavor.  My only gripe is the price!  Around $4 for a single scoop, which is quite modest in size compared to some other places.  But now that I know about their promos and text rewards (thanks fellow yelpers) I will be back!

This place is great! It is so quaint and homey, and that's one of the many reasons I love it.  They offer your traditional sushi rolls,  plus a few new and unique options.  Everything is fresh and delicious,  and I love that they use a light tempura batter.  Staff is SO nice,  and you can tell they genuinely care about their customers.  Can't wait to come back for their monthly sake tasting event.

The girl who cut my husband's hair did a horrific job. We thought going here would get us a hair stylist that had a greater skillset than an average sport clips/hair cuttery but that was obviously not the case. It was very uneven and I think he might be wearing a lot of baseball caps for the next few weeks!

I have spent the past year or so since moving to Gil ert driving down Warner and passing by this place. I always thought it was a basic, nothing special ice cream shop that served big tubs of standard, gritty ice cream.... nope nope nope!   I was very wrong. The ice cream is so, so smooth and creamy. You can't buy this type of ice cream in a grocery store.  As other reviews stated, it is slightly overpriced, but your tastebuds will thank you. The super farm was our favorite flavor.

This place is seriously adorable. Everyone is so nice, and it was genuine niceness too.  The little shop is unique and clean, and the courtyard was beautiful and roomy.  However, I did not care for the coffee. I had the dark roast drip and it lacked flavor. Next time I go back, I will try the americano!

It's good and pretty flavorful, although I've tried four different entrees now and they all are on the sweet, rather than spicy, side.  Maybe next time I will specify that I want some kick to it.  The lunch special is a great deal for $7.50. I will be back!

My husband just moved to Scottsdale fromVirginia and we were looking for a quick, but good quality place for lunch... And this is it! Friendly staff, fresh food, and quick service. The hummus plate is huge.  My husband got the sweet potato sandwich with fig and fresh mozzarella... It was amazingly good (and great portion too). We will be back!

Numnumnum! Went here for lunch and for $7.95 you get a side salad, eggroll, and main dish. I had the chicken panang and it was fantastic. My husband had drunken noodles with chicken and it was only good, but it tasted a little too much like stir fry oil.

The cupcakes here are perfect.  Moist cake, smooth and flavorful icing, and the perfect ratio of each.  The vanilla salted caramel is amazingly delicious, and you can taste all the flavors.  Sometimes they offer a 'buy one get one free' deal (I was told by the cashier to check the facebook page for specials and deals.

Yum! Definitely start with the drunk bread.  The burrata is also delicious - it was unlike anything I've ever tasted before.  I had the pork tenderloin and it was tender and flavorful. However, the potatoes and broccolini was bland. Great service!

the breakfast burrito is delicious and big!  It will not disappoint.  I love the local, personal feel of this little shop, but I really hope they are doing well.  The past several times I've been, they haven't had any permanent signage up, and I worry that people drive right by and don't even realize that there is a great little restaurant there!

The chopped salad gets 5 stars, but the entrees get 3 stars, which puts me at an overall rating of 4. I had the scallops and grits...they were very flavorful, but a little too heavy on the oil.  Husband had meatloaf and said it was average.  We both loved the chopped salad though.  I wish it was a littlebit larger because I would be perfectly happy eating it as my entree.

I am so smitten with this place! I am incredibly detail oriented and quite picky about my nails and toes, and this place exceeded my expectations. My nail tech was so diligent, spending one hour on my pedicure and one hour on my gel manicure. The gel manicure is by far the best I've ever had, even better than the $75 and up fancy ones I've had at resorts.

I am bummed. I thought I had finally found "my spot" but I went back for a pedicure today and it was unbelievably subpar.  The nail tech was nice but she barely did anything to my feet.  Honestly she just picked up each utensil and basically pretended to go through the motions.  Barely any filing, buffing, or cuticle trimming. I basically paid $25 for a polish change.  I guess our experience at pro nails heavily depends on your nail tech.

My favorite frozen yogurt spot! It's small, but so good. If you are a chocolate chip cookie dough fan, you will love their cookie dough topping. It actually looks and tastes exactly like the real deal.  Oh, and the guy who was working the cash register was very polite and friendly.

Great teppanyaki! The filet was perfectly flavored and cooked. The shrimp was fresh and large.  The chicken was just average, but hey that's chicken. The fried rice was perfect and the vegetables were great, I only wish they used less onion.  Our chef was so funny and he really made the experience a lot of fun.  Beware though- if you turn down the sake bottle, they will pull out a baby bottle for you instead!   Make a reservation, especially on weekends. Seems to be a very popular birthday party spot. They even give you and your guests free coffee flavored tiramasu if it's your birthday.

I wanted to try a little of everything so I had the sampler...pork bbq, brisket, and ribs. Everything was very good..my favorite was the brisket. Ribs had lots of tender meat. The bbq sauce was delicious as well.    The sides I had were mac and cheese and fries. The mac and cheese was very bland and I would not order that again. Fries were nothing special at all either. Next time I'll try different sides.   One last thing, this place is way better than Joe's BBQ in gilbert.

I hate giving two stars but this place has no redeeming qualities except for the two friendly employees I had interaction with.  Yes the happy hour specials are decent, but the beer is watered down.. They need to change their kegs!  The entire place also felt really.... Sticky.  Weird.  Like beer was spilled everywhere and not properly cleaned.

I really enjoyed my meal here! The ingredients were fresh and the portions were generous.  They have a great happy hour deal if you can make it by 7pm.  It also has a very fun atmosphere/vibe, even though it is located in an unassuming strip mall.  However, I will agree with other reviewers that it is HOT inside because of all the grills.  Overall, the food was great, the prices were reasonable, and the service was spot on.

Awesome tacos - I highly recommend the carne asada.  Quesadillas are good too, but there isn't much of a taste-difference.  We also tried a burrito, but it wasn't that impressive at all.  The beans were good, but I probably wouldn't order them again.    Indoor seating is very limited, so avoid peak times if you are trying to sit inside.  Parking is also a bit of a challenge at times.    Overall, this is a tasty little lunch spot. You can't really go wrong with what you order.  My biggest complaint is the FLIES inside.  Eat a taco in one hand and swat flies with the other.

How can anyone NOT give this place 5 stars? My husband and I were first time customers and we both left extremely satisfied.  The guy who helped us was knowledgeable,  friendly, and most importantly...he listened to us! We never felt hassled or rushed and the amount of indivualized attention they seem to give each customer is hard to find nowadays.  Great shop!

Very disappointed in this place.  All the food i ordered was overly spicy... I love spicy food but this was just spicy to a point of unenjoyable. Chicken was very bland but the beef was actually decent - probably the only positive thing of my experience. Also, the price was NOT WORTH the portion.  I'm not sure if they skimped on it since I was a take-out order, but I was shocked at how little food I got.

I'm actually sitting outside this place right now...totally on the verge of an epic sugar coma but it was so worth it!!  Honestly these donuts are amazing and the prices are super reasonable too. Coffee is only $1.35 and a single donut is just 88 cents. I recommend the buttermilk and the apple fritter. Amazeballs.

The beer was pretty delicious and so was the food. I recommend the Belgian pale ale or the lil guy rye. Yum! The pork fries with beer cheese and the jalapeño meatloaf sliders were the stars or the show though.  Our server was a little bit of a space cadet, but overall we had a great time and will be back soon.

I really enjoyed my bbq chicken salad. My only complaint is they definitely cheat you on the chicken. I had MAYBE two ounces worth. I guess they assume if they pile enough toppings on it, you won't notice.  Also, our server was ... quirky. Like, in an awkward,not funny way.

I am so happy to see another coffee shop in downtown mesa! I popped inside for an Americano, and it was very good. Very smooth and not bitter. The 12oz had two shots of espresso and was around $2.45 including tax.  They had several baked items for sale too, which I was told were homemade.  I'll be back!!

Came here for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and it wasn't busy at all - yay!  My husband and I had the acai bowl, the cheat day wrap, a hot coffee and a cold coffee (total around $18)- everything was excellent and we will definitely be back again. I love that they have healthy menu options and you don't leave feeling disgusted with yourself and vowing to skip lunch.  My only complaint is with one of the girl "servers".  They don't really serve you, rather you order at the register and they give you a table number. My husband had his burrito delivered to the table by a nice man, but when my acai bowl was ready, the girl just called out my number from the kitchen area for me to pick up myself. Normally I wouldn't complain, but the place was pretty dead inside and I am currently 41 weeks pregnant...... help a lady out! I noticed she pulled the same stunt for another customer who was visibly disabled! So she must be clueless... oh well. Hard to find good help nowadays.

Horrible, horrible service. Our server literally forgot she had our table. She brought us drinks and then ignored us for 15 minutes. The place wasn't busy at all (2pm on a Tuesday). Ridiculous. My father finally approached her as she was chatting casually with the bartender, and she was very apologetic. It was a crap situation, but we appreciated that she owned up to her mistake.  We asked her for the check for our drinks because we were tired of waiting waiting waiting. She assured us she would rush our food through the kitchen.  While our food DID come out within 15 mintues, it was NOT good. My salad was missing some ingredients and my father's chicken was very dry and bland.    It was disappointing that the manager never even stopped by to ask us about our dining experience. I don't dine-out prowling for freebies, but it would have been nice to discount our check or offer a complimentary dessert. This place needs to get its act together.

This place is AMAZING!! what a hidden gem. It's honestly my new favorite restaurant in Gilbert, I almost don't want to write this review because then the secret will be out! My husband and I came on a recent Saturday evening and were surprised that they still do happy hour on Saturdays. We were able to enjoy discounted wine and $6 apps. yay! The food was delicious... we enjoyed the bruschetta board here much more than another Gilbert restuarant's bruschetta board (you know who im talking about...)   They also had a two-man band playing some light classic rock hits. They were awesome! It wasn't too loud, and my husband and I could still carry on a conversation without having to yell over the band.  Service was excellent. Our server was there when we needed him and not over-bearing. Very friendly and prompt.   I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. LOVE IT! can't wait to return!

Not impressed. To start, the chips were cold, thick, and tasteless, but they are complimentary so it is what it is.  Their margarita menu has some delicious sounding concoctions, but be ready to pay for it. I tried the Queens cooler at the suggestion of our sever. It was really, really bad.  It reminded me of Malibu rum mixed with the cheapest tequila you can find.  It is expensive considering how weak it is (go get your buzz somewhere else...)  They have an extensive taco menu. Between my husband and myself, we tried about 8 different tacos and honestly we wouldn't come back for them... soggy and boring.   I brought home a chicken quesadilla for my mother and honestly it was delicious! Yes, that's right - the chicken quesadilla (boring old chicken and cheese) was the best thing we tried all night.    I will say that the hostess was friendly and our server was up eat, nice, and attentive.  The bus boys did a good job keeping our table clear too.

We used to go to the Anytime Fitness on Lindsay (also in Gilbert) but cancelled our membership because we were unhappy with the club/policies/service etc.  Then, we tried a mega-gym along Warner... unhappy there too! We decided to give Anytime Fitness another shot, but this time we picked a different location with a different owner. We couldn't be happier so far!! The club is spacious (considering the model), the equipment is new, the people are nice, and the place is always clean.  This is a great little gym for busy people who want to stay active :)

My husband I came here for the first time on a Wednesday evening around 7:30 and had an enjoyable dinner.    We ordered the calamari fries based on other Yelp reviews, but I didn't think they were amazing - they were just good.  To be honest, they reminded me of frozen fish sticks that you were forced to eat as a kid.  However, the accompanying dipping sauces added that extra umpf and made them pretty tasty.    We also had the beer battered lobster tacos, which were a special.  They were great! I would definitely get those again.   Service was fast, friendly and attentive.  The outside patio area was very quaint and relaxing.  Another great Gilbert restaurant!! :)
