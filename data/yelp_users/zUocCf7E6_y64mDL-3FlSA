Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to "On the Grill"

service was friendly, and prompt. Drinks were large and free refills, which I really appreciated. But as far as the food goes it was pretty average. I agree with some other reviewers who stated that the sauces seem watery, and the veggies seem canned. i had the yellow curry chicken. it's flavor was acceptable, but certainly not the best I've had. HOT was the spice level I requested, but disappointingly the spice level AND the food temp were somewhere around luke warm.  food = 2 stars service = 4 stars

The food is Burger King food. I don't have high expectations regarding quality. I do however expect that customer service will be at least up to par with other fat food joints.   This morning, i pulled in to grab a quick sandwich before a long day of meetings. After the car in front of me got done ordering, i pulled up to the menu, and was greeted in the normal fashion. Provided my order and got a "thank you". No total. No instructions to pull forward. So I pulled forward. Then the wait started....3 minutes......5 minutes....*shuts off engine*.....7 minutes before the person in front of me was presented with their order.....then more waiting, as the car and the girl in the window carry on a conversation lasting approximately 2 minutes.  When I finally got to the window. The employee asks "What did you want on that again?". I was a little taken back and said "So, my order has not been put in yet?". She snapped at me in a very matter-of-fact tone "NO".  Had she seemed even remotely understanding i would have just placed my order at the window. Instead I placed my money back into my pocket and began to pull away. At which point I received a very sarcastic "Byeeeeee".  For the Owners/Manager/Operators: There is very little that distinguishes your food from the other fast-food joints. I don't go because it's better. I go because it's convenient to where I am at any given time. I will, however, give my business to locations that provide stellar customer service. If you aren't communicating the need for customer service to your employees, you are failing. If your employees are not providing at LEAST a minimum of proper customer service, then they are failing you, and your bottom line.   I won't be going back to this location any longer for food, drinks, or the occasional shake anymore.

We started off here, by going to Maui Dog, which was closed due to an 8am burglary. Then we tried to keep the Hawaiian theme, and decided to go to Ono Hawaiian Grill. But upon walking into Ono and being overwhelmed by a sewage smell, we quickly turned around and walked in to On the Grill.  I went with the Chicken and Apple Sausage (which was a nice find because so few places will carry this). The sausage was tasty, and the condiments (lettuce, tomato, relish, etc..) all seemed to be fresh and presented nicely. The Fries were good as well. Nothing over the top here, just pretty good food. No complaints from me. The staff was very friendly, and jovial. I will go back if I'm ever in the neghborhood.
