Food was so-so. Carne Asada burrito I ordered came with beans which I wasn't expecting. I would suggest Filibertos over this place. You won't have to wait for your food for 30 minutes like I did and the food will probably be leaps and bounds better.

When Tacos Atoyac announced their closure back in March of 2014, I thought it was some sick twisted April Fools joke. April 2nd came and went, still no news. However Tacos Atoyac reopened (under a new and hardly pronounceable name) but it wasn't quite the same without Dan.   Fast Forward and Dan has returned, this time bringing fresh and adventurous tastes along with some old favorites.   I was happily greeted by the bearded man himself as I walked in, and gave the menu a quick run through. Dan knew my usual, now called the 50/50 (Carne Asada combined with Chorizo), and assured me that not only did it come in a taco but also in a burrito. My mouth was already watering. So I promptly ordered a 50/50 burrito along with a Bacon taco (yeah...bacon...meat candy) and a Brisket taco. Chips were then handed to me while I waited for my feast, I walked over to the salsa bar and grabbed some dark red salsa, which had an amazing smokiness to it, and the avocado creama which is light and fresh.   When the food came, it looked great and the portions were bigger than Dan's previous restaurant. I first took a bite into the Bacon taco...and then immediately devoured it. I could probably eat a dozen of them in one sitting. The brisket taco was next. The meat was tender and flavorful, the sliced oranges and cilantro really tied it all together. The 50/50 was the highlight of the meal. Both the Carne and Chorizo were far beyond flavorful, I compared eating this burrito to that of a spiritual experience.   Hands down Mucho Macho blows Tacos Whatever out of the water. This is my new "got to" and is the home of the best tacos in Phoenix. Get down here!
