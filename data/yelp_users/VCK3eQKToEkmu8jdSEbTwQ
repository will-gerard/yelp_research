I adore this restaurant. I just love it. I've eaten here more than a dozen times. It's a shame I haven't gotten around to writing any reviews. So here I go!  Good to be able to see the kitchen. Not the cleanest in the world, but it certainly doesn't scare me off. The head chef/owner NEVER takes any days off. He's always there, cooking up a frenzy. I admire his work ethic.  The food is amazing. Love the Dragon Eggs (crispy) for the appetizer. Their Galee Gai is simply delicious. Their awesome soup Tom Yum Gai is worthy of an award.   You can go anywhere you want on this menu and you won't make any wrong turns.  The ONLY comment (note that it's not a complaint) is that some of their servers do not have full command of the English language. Knowing that they emigrated from Thailand and seeing their extremely cheerful disposition just makes everything ok. Just speak slowly and be understanding: they are, after all, in a big and strange country. If you happen to have the same server I had, just smile and be nice. You'll be justly rewarded!   This restaurant sets the standard of service, food quality and overall experience. I cannot wait to go back.

Yet another phenomenal meal. Had the Dragon Eggz which were tangy as ever. Also tried the Turtle Island Crab, which is literally a deconstructed won ton. Just brilliant. And the perfect thing to have during the awful Phoenix summer!  For dinner I ordered the Temple of Fire, and they weren't joking. It would be nice if they wouldn't pound the chicken flat as a pancake, though! Cook the whole thing and cut it up, instead! Pounding a chicken flat makes it tough.   The service was stellar as always. Our server was cheerful, and on point.

This place isn't much to look at; in fact it's terrifying. They have Christmas ornaments with lights stung up all year long, which is bizarre. But so what...  Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious, greasy, and just bad for you. Very enjoyable. If you want a "feel good" moment, come here for a breakfast croissant.  And now on to the star of the show: Donuts. Made fresh every day. If you come early enough (the earliest I came was at 4am on Valentine's Day!) the donuts are still warm.  I cannot say in just one post how delicious and AWESOME their donuts are. Greasy, decadent, bad for you...something for everyone!   Yes this is as good as it gets, folks. Try this place out, either for breakfast and/or donuts. You won't be disappointed.

This is THE place to go. Always busy, lunch or dinner, and their food is always superior. I've eaten here many times and I'm never disappointed. Their sushi is wonderful (I wish you guys would serve halibut!!) and their noodles are out of this world. Love the soba, chicken Parmesan, and especially the Salmon Cream Sauce.  Looking upon the menu, a newcomer would think that the owners are crazy; this place offers cuisine from Thailand, Korea, Japan...and ITALY...but they do it well. I cannot rave enough about their kitchen and the guys scurrying like madmen at the grill. Bravo.  Bravo goes out to Yuka, who is the real star of the show. She's a fantastic server. After knowing her for a couple of years, she now greets me with a hug and an ever-present loud and genuinely warm greeting.   I will never tire of this place. Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe sets the bar high and keeps it there.

What can I say. The ambiance is fantastic. The restaurant is clean. The service is friendly.  And the food...spectacular. I prefer going during lunch for the buffet...which is a rarity for me, since I typically loathe buffets. But this restaurant's buffet is packed full of flavorful choices; from the chicken to the vegetable or potato pakoras.   On the dinner menu, my first choice is the chicken vindaloo. Just superb.   On a side note, you should check out their music videos playing on the two tv screens. (Again, this is against the grain for me, since I usually loathe and rant about any restaurant with tv!) Sometimes the videos are so lurid that they're addicting to watch! They're all the same with the same theme: Man falls in love with girl. Girl dances and acts coy. Man sings to woo her. Man gets girl. The end. lol  Flavors of India is a gem. Lunch or dinner, this is the place to go.

I obviously had low expectations going in. It is just a golf course burger shack, after all. The chicken sandwich with tomato, cheddar, avocado and bacon wasn't too bad at all. The fries are cut so thin that you must eat them immediately: extremely thin fries like this get cold very quickly and are thus inedible.  The service, surprisingly enough, was the low point. Our server literally showed us the bare minimum of courtesy, not even greeting us upon arrival. "Have you made your decision?" was the introduction. A very simple "Hello how are you?" would suffice.  It is obvious that this job is just a temporary one for the wait staff, and it shows.  You get what you expect: simple menu, simple food, simple service...nothing to keep you away, nothing to entice you to come back. Basically this destination is the place to be when you're done practicing your swing.

I read the awesome reviews on this site, therefore my expectations were high. After all, Phoenix is plagued with AWFUL Chinese restaurants.   Our entire dinner was bland. The sauce that accompanied the Fried Wontons was insipid and flavorless. Red, thick sauce should be sweet. This was not. Unimpressed. The pot stickers were ok, but nothing special enough to write home about.  I was leery about ordering the Tangerine Beef, because I had a rancid dish of the same name from a different Chinese restaurant a couple years ago. Thought I'd give it a go. Bland. Beef pounded into oblivion smothered with a sauce so faint that it cried for flavor.   The Sesame Chicken, bland as well, was overcooked and nowhere near as sweet as one should like.  The Kung Pao Chicken was the least amusing dish of all. No flavor, no heat, and no veggies.   The Mu Shu Pork was ok, but the plum sauce was, again, bland!  Now, the cleanliness and presentation of the restaurant was in face phenomenal. Very clean and the lit candles on the tables were a very nice touch.  The service was legendary. Very chipper, friendly, and at times amusing. There was an older lady whose job apparently was to take dirty dishes from the tables and only says "thank you!" when she does anything near you.  I noticed that a great many of the diners were very elderly. Is there a retirement village nearby? Do you not realize that the elderly LOVE buffets and bland food? This restaurant was full of both, and I think it was the army of elderly people with diminishing taste buds who wrote all those glowing reviews.  I understand that people have varying opinions and tastes, but come on! Raise your standards and start asking yourself if the food you are tasting really deserves FOUR or FIVE stars? Fail.

THIS is the place to go for honest automotive work. I have been coming here since 2007 for oil changes, car battery, emissions and other various work over the years.   I have referred two friends to this shop and both have thanked me profusely for doing so.   I cannot recommend this place enough. This is the real deal and they will not give you the run around.

I am no expert on Korean food, and I will never be. Oxknee soup? How does one eat an animal's knee? Huh?  Whatever. What I had was wonderful. I had beef in very hot, boiling broth with cabbage and carrots. Also had pork, which was more flavorful than I was expecting.  There's several items on the menu that was completely alien to me, so I cannot vouch for the more exotic items they offer.   But if you like Korean, and/or want to try something new (and really good!), then check this place out.

Who would have thought that I would go nuts over gas station food? Well, hell has frozen over. Taquitos, hot dogs, endless condiments...this is a hungry man's paradise when you only want to spend a couple bucks and you don't have much time.  Also appreciated is the COMPLETE LACK of shady people asking for money, homeless people gibbering about, etc. Why can't every other gas station (and convenience store!!) follow this trend and not allow any solicitation whatsoever?   Five stars to a gas station may seem a stretch, but they are 100% deserving since their efforts have been 100% effective.   Bravo.

This is the very best (and inexpensive) Vietnamese food you can get in Phoenix. I cannot convey how flavorful and wonderful and fresh the food is. Don't know what you want? No problem! Just point randomly at the menu and order something.  Service: A little on the slow side, but the food is so good that I don't care. That's a very high compliment from me, because I'm NOT forgiving.  Ambiance: None. This place is a dump, and I don't care: This IS Phoenix, so we're all trash anyway! (Especially YOU, Scottsdale snobs, I KNOW who you are! lol) The fluorescent lighting is lurid and harsh on the eyes. No music playing. It's a miracle that the sagging ceiling didn't fall upon our heads. This restaurant is literally on its last legs. Very much in need of a remodel and a makeover.   So, put on your dirty soiled wife beater, and your flip flops, and you're set. Da Vang is devine!

Just fantastic. The lobster bisque soup could have been a meal all unto itself. The BBQ pork sandwich was phenomenal.  But the secret behind this place is its employees. They're fast, efficient, and always on task. They scurry around as if their workplace was a hive.   I'll definately be back.

Oh boy. I really want to give this place more stars. I really do. I love the idea of Phoenix Public Market. Our city NEEDS hangouts like this. Ten years ago this would have been unthinkable...but I digress.  The awesome point about PPM are the employees. They are thoughtful, cheerful, caring and knowledgeable. Very impressed with the level of service from just a dessert and coffee bar. Another good point goes to cleanliness. Very clean indeed. Unfortunately...  When you top a cupcake with a large dollop of butter frosting, you do NOT refrigerate it. The cake itself goes dry, and the frosting ends up tasting like and feeling like...you guessed it...eating a solid stick of butter. Very unpleasant. I tried the espresso and found myself dismayed by it. My espresso tasted as if the water was pushed through an orange rind. The heavy citrus suckerpunch was unexpected and unpleasant.   The cookies were fine, as were the candy bars for sale on the counter.  This is an AWESOME place to meet for a first date, etc. They just need to work out some kinks and they will have a goldmine. I will come back in a couple months. I have high hopes.

It's awesome to have a movie theater with NO KIDS. It's awesome to have a movie theater where the white trash behind you cannot kick your chair.   Food: better than any other movie theater around. Chicken tenders are awesome, and when I ask for extra ranch dressing, oh boy do they comply.  This is my favorite theater and I cannot say anything better.

I've been coming here for almost two years. The people who work the drive thru are always very nice. I used to work fast food when I was a teenager: I know how AWFUL drunk customers (sober ones too!) can be so I'm all the more impressed that the crew of this store has such dignity and poise. Bravo.  The food is always made when I order it, so my burgers and fries are hot and tasty.   Living around the corner has its perks, so I'll be back.  Thank you to everyone at this store for awesome service!

Love the look of the restaurant. Very clean and comfortable.  Service is stellar. The staff are knowledgeable and are helpful without being overly intrusive.  The real star of the show here is the food. Simply amazing. I love how the menu is partitioned. The dishes come in appetizer portions for sharing, which means you can sample a good part of the menu in just one visit.  Cheese curds: You cannot go wrong. Lightly battered and fried in NEW oil; yes I can taste and see the difference!  Pea Shoot Salad: A revelation. Pea shoots? Bacon? It works! And the parmesan tuille is the stuff of legend. I normally don't order salads in restaurants, but this wins me over. A must try!  Beef Milanesa: Simply put, one of the most flavorful dishes on the menu.   Beet Canneloni: Tastes like a dessert! Wonderful!  Tuck Shop is one of the finest restaurants in Phoenix to take a date to. Hurry! Go!

Kenyata is wonderful. She is the reason why this pharmacy gets five stars. She's sweet, courteous, and on the ball.   This pharmacy really wants your business, and it shows. Oddly enough, one of the reasons I like this pharmacy so much is that it's not very well known: it's slow and therefore I'm almost always first in line. I just remember back when I used to go to Walgreens and had to wait behind some idiot who had NOTHING to do but gum up with gears of everyone else.   Not any more.   I know by posting about this gem, I'm going to make this pharmacy all the more popular, so I hope that whoever reads this and goes there does not gum up the gears on purpose just to vex me lol. :)

I'm very excited about this place. It reminds me of a long-gone coffee shop in Sedona called Cups. No two chairs, tables, or coffee cups were the same. There was artwork packed on the walls made by local artists...all for sale...and the place was charming. But no more. It got bulldozed for the sake of a larger strip mall. Progress, right?  Urban Beans reminds me of Cups. Most of the chairs and tables are wildly different (some of the chairs are too wild...they are impossible to walk around which can be a nuisance if the place is busy), and there is some art on the walls available for sale.   The pastries are wonderful, and their menu items are fantastic. The coffee tastes wonderful, and I should know, because I've been in the industry for many years.   The people behind the counter are helpful and friendly. Can't ask for more.   The only critique is that the walls are a bit in a state of disrepair and the lighting needs to be tweaked a bit. This location is on the brink of becoming a TOP NOTCH place to go. Phoenix LACKS culture and art (First Friday is a laughable waste of time), and Urban Beans stands to be the game-changer in this arena.   Take note, Phoenix! Urban Beans is a wonderful hangout, and it poised to start a new trend in coffee shops and hangouts. I am exited to see what the future holds.

The very best tacos in town. The Aztec Tinga is fantastic...but the real star of the show is the Napoleon taco.   Also fantastic are the quesadillas...and they will forever change the way you think about them. You'll never order a quesadilla from Taco Bell ever again. You've been warned. THESE quesas are puff pastries filled with gorgeous things, and then topped with Mexican sour cream.   Also check out their salsa bar. Too many to choose from; and there are no wrong choices to make.  Run to La Condesa. Run past every other mediocre Mexican restaurant to get here because THIS place is the real deal.

I've eaten at this place many times, but this is my first time reviewing on Yelp.   While I have enjoyed my chicken sandwich, the fries were cold. My first job was at a fast food restaurant, so I know how long it takes for fries to get cold and inedible. That knowledge just makes it all the more insulting, knowing that my food was cooked BEFORE I set foot in the establishment. Lazy. Very lazy.  If you're going to serve me an awesome sandwich, why pair it with a side that was borderline comatose? Unhappy.   Next time I want a good experience I'll just go to The Stand.

Oh, I wanted to love this place! I really did. Phoenix NEEDS cupcakes, desserts, pastries, etc! I was very underwhelmed.   The Key Lime cupcake was the best of the lot. I'm a sucker for key lime, but that's this cupcake's saving grace. The flavor was very subtle, and this is a trend with all the cupcakes.   The Lemon cupcake was very much lacking in flavor. Even more subtle than the Key Lime.   One good thing are the cakes themselves; at least they're moist. And the ratio of frosting to cake is spot on. However the flavors are not quite what I was expected, especially given how much each cupcake cost.   I'll probably try this place again sometime next year, if they're still in business. Maybe there will be a tastier batch of cupcakes! As for now I'm going to pass.   On a side note, the ladies behind the counter were in fact very kind and personable.

At first glance I had high hopes. Candles on all tables. Attentive wait staff. Live music(!)...but in the end all this just didn't add up.  The crab wontons were fine. Strong taste of crab and the sauce was very flavorful. The entrees were far too soupy. Either serve the ingredients with plenty of sauce...or drown the dish in muck and call it a SOUP or a STEW.   I ordered the Mussaman (braised beef) which was quite flavorful, but the dish was a mess. It was just pieces of onion, scalloped carrots and tender beef lost in a bowl full of broth. I thought I ordered a beef dish...not a soup? And why scallop a carrot? Leave the vegetable alone. Round carrots are fine.   Choo Chee Seafood was also ordered, with the same result: lost in a soupy mixture with no substance.  It took FOR-EV-ER to get our check. I almost got up to beg the waitress for our tab. It wasn't even busy, so it's not like she was behind.  With all the attention to the decor and overall look of the restaurant, I'm a little saddened that the food has been overlooked. A pretty high price was paid for a mediocre meal.

Another great offering from Fox Concept Restaurants. Bravo.  The building looks like a giant barn, and the interior resembles a barn as well. But don't be fooled; this restaurant is CLEAN as a whistle and the lighting is spot on. The servers and bartenders are dressed in jeans and other farm attire so they do look a little goofy, but it works. It just works. The bartenders actually care about you enjoying your experience. They're not there to puff up their chests and flex for the girls. These guys know customer service and they are spectacular.  The food?! Heavenly. The arancini was perfect and the sauce divine. But the real treat was the main course: I tried the Bolognese, which is something I have perfected (in my opinion!) at home. I'm very picky. Luckly, they did not disappoint. The bolognese was very moreish and I could not stop eating. I left a very happy man. Kudos to the guys scurrying around in the open-air kitchen!  And now for my one (and only) bitch about this restaurant: and I nearly took away a star because of it. JUST as the sun was setting, the bartenders took it upon themselves to open all the window-doors surrounding the bar. It's nice, but only when it's 79 degrees outside! And the sun...burst forth and blinded me along with anyone else sitting westward. All the nice cool air just slipped out the restaurant and it became quite uncomfortable.  Yes, I know it's Friday night and you want the restaurant to seem as open as possible...but it's already A BARN! You do not need to open all the windows in the middle of summer...and especially when the sun is still able and willing to stun and piss off your diners.   This restaurant, despite the only one flaw, is a masterpiece. (And guys, STOP going out in public wearing flip flops or sandals. You all look ridiculous.) I step off my soapbox.

Nice place to grab a sandwich for lunch! Very fast, efficient and friendly workers. A diverse menu to select from. I had a panini sandwich and it was pretty tasty. Food was made to order and still came out amazingly fast.   The food prep area was kept very clean. As for the dining area, it was a little neglected, and because of this, there were many people circling about looking for clean tables.  Otherwise this is a very decent restaurant. Too bad they're not open on Sundays.

The awesome thing about this restaurant is the front of house staff. They are always friendly, attentive, and just fun to talk to. They make you feel at home.  The food is wonderful, and the decor is just as wonderful. The parking, however, is impossible after 10am. Go early.  The kitchen area is a little disorganized and disheveled, but the kitchen staff manages to crank out quality and good tasting dishes at a good pace.    I'll definitely be back. The food and service is superior. I'll just avert my eyes next time I'm standing towards the kitchen. OK I'm lying: I always look and cannot stop.

I had very low expectations just going in: this looks revolting from the outside. I was quite surprised by the indoors, however. Very swanky and clean! Modern! Nice lighting.   The good: The dining room. Already went over that. Honorable mention: The service. Our server was quick, attentive and kind.   The bad: The food. I had the green chili chicken enchiladas. Horrifically over seasoned! Every bite was like trying to swallow a forkful of pepper. The enchiladas sat in my stomach like a pair of squeamish bricks that are too afraid to touch each other. Very unsettling.   On way out, I had the chance to get a good look at the kitchen area. Not the cleanest kitchen in the world, people. And one of the prep cooks was chewing gum. Unacceptable.    I should have followed my gut instinct and stayed away from this oh-too-familiar bar food cuisine. That's what I get for trying something I was leery about to begin with! I ate over six hours ago and my stomach is still hating me.   The two stars are for the cleanliness (of the dining room ONLY) and for the servers.

What a great find...and in such an unexpected place! One would never think there would be a culinary oasis in the NW Valley, but now one has been found!  This restaurant is gorgeously decorated without being prissy. The waitress greets you with a complimentary soup and fried roll with a delicious accompanying sauce. What a great start!   Choose your protein! Choose your sauce! Done! You really cannot go wrong with their menu. The chicken is ample and the beef dishes are cooked to perfection. The vegetables, cooked nicely, still had a nice crunch.   The curry dishes are simply wonderful, no matter whether you choose red, yellow or spice level. Run with your choice and enjoy!  Again, this restaurant is WAY the heck out of nowhere (do not ask my why I was even near lol), but if you ever find yourself out this way, please do check this gem out!

Awesome place to go for a burger! The burgers are cooked to order, which makes it well worth the wait. The chicken tacos are awesome as well, despite the fact I do not like cilantro all that much. The fries are good, and the lemonade is simply fantastic.  The cheery employees helps set this place apart from any other. They really make you feel welcome and appreciated.  The Stand is also very well organized and clean. A very good indicator that the staff take pride in their job.   I will be back, that's for sure!
