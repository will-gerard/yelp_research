I have recently rediscovered Sunflower Market after a long absence.    The reason for the absence?  Well, I liked the place when it first opened.  After about a year or two, it started going downhill.  Fruit flies around the produce, meat that was about to start a second life and, once, a batch of sausages that were inedible due to the amount of salt that was dumped in them.  Combine that with an altercation I had with some other customers, and I decided, screw it.  I wasn't particularly in love with Bashas' and Fry's, but they would have to do.  This was about three or four years ago.  Recently, I decided to try them out again at my wife's urging.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Though the meat section is still small, the quality has increased.  The produce is fresh, nicely priced, and they have a lot of the vegetables that I don't bother with at the larger stores because of either price or bad experiences.  I like the wine and beer selections, as well as the bakery.  I have to force myself to behave when I'm in there.  One problem still persists, though.  Sunflower Market does cater to the granola crowd, and as long as they are willing to pay through the nose for anything with a sticker that says organic, regardless of the actual quality, people will be there to make a buck off of them.  And, because they are trying to also cater to the vegetarian and alternative diet crowds, there are way too many off-brands.  Some of it I like, but I really don't see a reason why some of them should be consistently two or three dollars more than the name brands.  Yes, I am a meat-eating, moderately conservative Republican, and I'm sure I stick out like a sore thumb in that store, but like everyone these days my shopping decisions are largely made on a combination of price and quality - and people who are forced into eating a restricted diet should not have to pay dearly for it, either.   Well, I'm off the soapbox.  Right now, with the way they are going, Sunflower Market is the best grocery chain in the Valley, and I'm glad they're here.   Minor quibbles aside, I have seen my grocery bill shrink by $30.00 to $40.00 by going there, and I'm actually coming home with what I consider the ingredients for a balanced meal.  And, if you know me, you know my eyes are, shall I say, drifting while I'm shopping.  Gets me poked in the ribs by my wife but, just like when I'm in the baking aisle, I behave myself.  Time to go pop one of their saltwater taffies before I head off to bed.

This place is great.  I must say, in their defense, I have never had bitter espresso.  Everything here, especially the Mocha Especiale, is great.  Not to mention they tend to survive despite having a Starbucks across the way.  That's because their coffee beats Starbucks' rancid, burnt dishwater-tasting swill hands down.  They also have a great staff.  The sad thing is, I never get a chance to just hang out.  I'm always on the go.  I'm hoping that will change soon, because just walking in there relaxes me.    I also occasionally enjoy their pastries.  I don't know about in the past, but they currently come from a local Kosher bakery.  Haven't tried the cakes or pie yet, but they look delicious.    In summary (since I'm in a hurry to go pick someone up and run by there at the moment as it is), great atmosphere, great service, great coffee.  And, no, I don't think it's too expensive.  The prices here are about normal for most places I've been to.

Ever had one of those places you like to go eat that you actually get sad when you don't get a chance to go there?  Well, for me, this is one of them.    I have been going here for a few years now.  I enjoy the atmosphere, the people, the staff - and, most importantly, the food.  Chicken fried steak and eggs?  Oh yeah.  Delicious fish fry on Fridays?  Definitely.  The best club sandwich in town?  No doubt about it.  Of course, I need to mention the wait staff.  There are a number of comments I've seen about how pretty the waitresses are.  Yes, that's true.  More importantly, though, they are some of the best you will find anywhere.  No false flirtiness and no gruffness - just fast, friendly service that makes you feel like they are actually glad you showed up to eat.  It's a welcome change from the service you get in most places these days.  The only flaw?  They're not open 24 hours!  That's probably because they know if they were, then they would have a hard time getting some of us to leave.

It had been a while since I was here.  Used to go all the time when I lived in the neighborhood, but I'm quite a ways away now.  Still, my wife and I got the urge to stop by.  With everything that has changed in Tempe over the years (I miss Eastside Records being next door to this place), it's nice to see some things haven't changed.  The price may be slightly more than it was, but you can still get a great meal for under $10.00 or, in our case, just getting and sharing teh whole chicken for $12.99 (it will make two meals for two people easily).    The choice?  Grilled marinated chicken or steak (or a combo plate of both) with corn or flour tortillas and beans, salsa and marinated onions on the side.  And, to note, these are whole beans, not the typical refried you get at most places. It's simple and delicious, and you don't feel like you just consumed a lump of grease and cheese after you're finished eating.    Yes, they still only take cash or check, but typically regulars know this and make sure they have money on hand before going in.  Also, I'm sure everyone who has eaten here has finished off the rest of their condiments by just mixing the beans, onions and salsa all into one cup.

Fry's Electronics is a place I go to in emergencies.  Unfortunately, when something breaks on my computer, it usually takes the whole thing down.  Forget about finding something at a decent price on Egghead and having it there in a couple days; no access to the internet means a trip to Fry's.  And a trip to Fry's means finding out that they have everything - except the replacement part you need.  You see, that part, which you installed a year before, is now obsolete, and they don't sell it.  Never mind that millions of people are still using it because most of us can't afford to have bleeding edge technology and upgrade over every miniscule increase in speed or graphic ability, and that you can get it easily from an online store - to Fry's, it's obsolete.  The reason it's obsolete?  Because it's cheaper than the new item that they want you to buy.  The new item that requires buying three or four more new items along with it since your old equipment is not compatible with the new.  In this day and age, no computer means a third to a half of your communication with the outside world, and not to mention access to important parts of your life, is gone.  You're stuck watching as a $50.00 replacement spirals into the $500.00 range.  One thing that Fry's teaches you is preventative maintenance.  You learn to make sure you've got some money and that Egghead or Amazon has what you need in store the first time you even hear the slightest rattle or see the slightest flicker.  If not, it's back to Fry's - Virgil greets you at the door, you descend through the rings until, under the beating wings of the Beast himself, you gather everything you need and slowly wind your way through their service line and back to the Purgatory of their parking lot.  And Virgil's tried to sell you a bunch of candy on the way out as well.

This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.  Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).    I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space.  It amazes me that they have survived all this time.  And, boy, am I glad they have.  A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.    If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.  Heck, I'd even buy them a bigger place if I could!  This is one of the last truly independent record stores.  I'm happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well.  Edit: They closed down on 12/31/10.  I'm going to miss them.  Hopefully they'll reopen somewhere else, even if it is only online.  My regret is that I didn't have enough money to do one final run through there.

No, it's probably not authentic Cajun food.  Who cares?  It's Arizona.  The important thing is that the food is great.  I have had many items off the menu, from the po' boys to the quail, and it has all been delicious - and nicely priced.  Occasionally there were times when things were slow or confused when they first opened, but the kinks seem to have been ironed out.  The owners and the wait staff are all friendly, and even greet you by name if you're a regular.  Not to mention I have a bit of a (non-creepy) crush on the waitress.  Just mentioning this to see if she turns red the next time I come in! :)    All-in-all, a friendly place with good food.  I'm glad to see they've stayed open, and hope that things only get better for them.

Barbecue is a bit of an iffy thing for me, at least in the Phoenix area.  I have tasted some great barbecue, but they tend to be quite a drive for me.  I tend to avoid the chains and, as much as I love some of their food, Bill Johnson's has always lacked.  So, a while back, I noticed a little unassuming restaurant open up in my neighborhood.  Up to then I had been occasionally going to another local chain that had a place near me, but was often turned off by the attitude of the employees, despite the food being pretty good.  It was time for something new.    And what a happy person I am.  Over the last few months, I have been happy to enjoy pork, chicken and beef from this place, and regularly try to stop by on Wednesday for their excellent wings.  Now, we're not talking about little, dried up chicken wings; we're talking big ones, not cut into little pieces, and with their very own wing sauce on it.  The pulled pork sandwiches are served with their delicious cole slaw right on the sandwich, the regular smoked chicken is flavorful even without the sauce, and the briscuit is amazing.  And, yes, the ribs are great, too.  No rubber band texture; you can practically pick it right off the bone.  Not in the mood for barbecue?  Friday nights in fish fry, and Saturdays they are featuring a New Orleans-themed menu, including catfish and shrimp poboys - which I unfortunately haven't had a chance to try yet, since they sell out rather quickly.  So, yes, Tempe, there is a barbecue place worth going to.  And the staff?  Happily, friendly and talkative.  Nothing like people happy to see you frequenting their establishment.

Been here twice now.  Was introduced to it by a coworker when we decdied to take a bit of extra time for lunch one day.  First thing I tried was the seafood with corn, and was happy to find the noodles were tasty and stretchy; there is a big difference between this and buying them dry at the store.  And, yes, it is a completely different texture than what most people here are used to.  They are Chinese noodles after all, and not pasta.  The dish as a whole was good, even though they used imitation crab, which I usually avoid.  The fact I enjoyed it regardless is saying something.  I also stole both some of the steamed and fried dumplings from my lunchmates, and both were great, although I prefer the fried.    Second visit I went for the seafood noodles and, this time, it was straight up what I love: fish balls, shrimp, squid and scallops, all cooked perfectly in a flavorful sauce.  Also ordered the spicy pig ear, which was quite good, even though the portions are a bit much for an appetizer.  My wife enjoyed her beef noodles with oyster sauce, and I also sampled from my friend's "mixed meat" platter (largely marinated beef and pig ears).    All-in-all a great place so far, and it's nice to have an Asian place to eat again that's not a buffet.

For over three years I have been going to this Fry's, largely because it was cleaner and not as hectic as the one at Southern and Rural.  It's been largely the same staff, and I have been happy to shop there.  Until today.  I'll admit my end of the responsibility.  I was tired, got distracted, and left $40.00 cash back that I had received at one of the quick checkout locations.  I went to get coffee, and noticed it was missing, and immediately went back to the store.  This was all within about 20 minutes.  I figured either someone had turned it in or they would actually engage in some professional and proper customer service.    Well, someone walked off with it, and the store refused to reimburse me.  And, no, I do not think it was an outlandish request.  I work in an industry where we are generally required to fulfill this type of request on a constant basis.  It is called customer service.  If I was the manager of the store, or even the owner, I would have figured the $40.00 was more than worth keeping a customer.  And, yes, I have put this in practice privately as well, reimbursing peple who purchased items from me on eBay even though technically there was shared responsibility; it just makes good business sense as long as the person doesn't make repeated demands.  As for the store, it is better laid out, better maintained and many of the staff are friendlier than your typical Fry's location in Tempe.  No more than your typical big-name supermarket, but until today I was satisfied.  I know this is partially venting, but it is also something you should consider when going to this location, or any Fry's: they could care less about you as a customer, despite what all their advertising says.

Looks like this place could use a little love.    For the longest time the Zia Records at Dobson and Chandler had been my favorite.  Items were priced to sell, staff friendly.  A little cramped and a bit disorganized on Record Store Day, but minor complaints.   The new location is similar to the one they opened in Tempe as it is a larger store that follows the trend of catering to more than just records.  It has stereo equipment, instruments, toys, books, video games, etc.  It reminds me of Bookmans back when they were much more enjoyable to visit (and without having to go to a dicey neighborhood).   I go there mainly for music and am quite happy with the selection.  I do wish they would put out more grab bags like they used to (I have a habit of finding some rather expensive gems in there - which may be why I don't see them as much anymore), but in general a casual look through everything will net me some stuff I need and an even closer look will net me a stern look from my wife once I come home and grab the hand truck.   As for the staff, they are still great.  Unlike the way I remember Zia in the past I have the joy of seeing many of the same faces there every time I visit.    This is also the store that sponsors the monthly Cult Classic showings at Pollack Cinema down the road.  Mary (the manager) is usually there with some goodies to sell.
