I had a wonderful experience tasting cake for my wedding. We worked with Stacey and she was very down to earth and friendly. It was just a very well put together presentation. Delicious and natural cakes with a lot of different options. The peanut butter filling was stupid good. I didn't expect to like it so much! :)  Great bakery! Highly suggested!

Amazing pizza! Yuuuuum! Chewy crust and delicious toppings. Didn't skimp on the toppings either.  Hubby got a free pizza too, for his bday. Had the tiramisu and it was yummy as well. Overall- we will be back!  PS even our 9 yr old was happy :)

I was actually really looking forward to getting my hair done. What girl doesn't? Well, the girl started with my highlights, and it took a really long time which I expected from a hair school, afterall they are learning! Then the haircut......  I chose a Toni and Guy hair style thinking that I was doing my girl a favor. It was a hair style that I thought would be simple since it was one of their styles that they teach. She began to cut and was complaining that her scissors were "bending" my hair. They were dull and she kept having to re-cut and re-cut to make it even. A teacher walked by and she told her what was happening. The response she got was that the "sharpening person came through yesterday, so too bad". My cut took so long, that the school was about to close. They asked me to go and pay before she had even begun to finish. I did. Students had just finished their last class in the other room and stood around staring at my hair and not in a good way, I'm assuming because they wanted to close. I ended up with a mullet-style when I had asked for a bob. The hair cut was supposed to lay about a inch and a half below my chin and the front of my hair was about two inches above my chin. I had a long layer in the back and I was mortified! I would have said something, but I felt that my hair was beyond even fixing without chopping it all off! Plus, they were all wanting to leave and "waiting" for us to finish and the girl behind the counter had done all of her paper work. What was I supposed to do? I thanked her and even tipped her for her time, went to my car and cried.   This was the first time I ever cried from a haircut. It's hair and it will grow back, but this just plain sucked! Sorry Toni and Guy, never again.

No more complimentary cornbread - raised happy hour prices and didn't raise quality or change menu. Server have a bs answer that they are trying to "class it up" and be "more of a fine dining restaurant".  I had to have our server take 3 kids drinks for $2.95 a piece off of our check that should've come with the meal.We were also charged for our brothers birthday dessert which we just paid for, not knowing if a birthday dessert is usually comped or not.   We ordered an additional dessert too. Promise we aren't cheap....just disappointed.

Wonderful brunch with my love. I had the eggs Benedict a he had the green chile pork. Both dishes were FULL of flavor and delicious. We had to order the fries too :) truffle ketchup was to die for! The other two were good but the ketchup was superior. No room for dessert....next time!

(Update at bottom) First I have to say that my husband and I frequent Picazzo's and love their happy hour!   Recently we've noticed a decline/change in a few items that make us very sad. Their meatballs used to be our favorite and we would come just for them. The last 2 times we've gone, they were MUCH smaller and almost taste frozen. Im not sure why they changed it.....maybe cost? Second was their flatbread with dates, Fuji apple and Prosciutto. The flat bread was doubled up and not cooked evenly and the prosciutto was gummy and fatty, not crispy as usual. Hmmmmm I sure hope this place isn't going down hill. One of our favs!  Update- food seems to be back on the incline :) thanks for listening guys! Last few visits were great!

Had great deals on sushi all day. Went with my family and we were already planning our next visit. Service felt a bit rushed but she was friendly enough. She was just very busy. Good value and quality food. We will be back!!

This place outrages me! The poor babies are ALL sick and not kept clean. They all had diarrhea and the sales associates did not seem to care one bit. The puppy in the front window was crying and scratching at the door and then had terrible diarrhea all over the place. They finally opened the door when we complained the third time and only cleaned a portion of it out. That poor baby had walked in it and went 4-5 times all around the space. They seemed annoyed.   Dogs don't poop where they sleep you insensitive morons! Read the many reviews about sick puppy mill dogs:(  I'm broken hearted after going here.

Good product- if you buy it, it will be frozen most likely. Also, no ordering from the menu unless it's Thursday-Saturday.

I am a teacher and love to get massages. I used to belong to massage envy and I was tired of paying for an hour massage and getting 40 minutes once they let you change for 10 min before and after.   First class reflexology to the rescue! I've always received a full 60 min no matter what! They may not always speak fluent English, but seriously, who cares! I was coming once a week for a while because of the price point ($35/hr). They would do a full body massage and I would fall asleep every time they would massage my feet!! I don't fall asleep easily at all. The pressure was always nice and firm and I always left feeling wonderfully worked over and relaxed.   It's a bit different since you lay down in a room with a curtain( no doors) and the beds are not traditional massage tables. Just give the massage a chance!

Oh how sad.  My family wanted to use our restaurant.com certificate and we're excited to try McFadden's. The menu sounded delish! We ordered a yummy beer, an appetizer,  soup and dinner. We took the suggestions our waitress gave us and ordered the rock shrimp and fish and chips and potato soup.  It ALL came out at the same time. Whatever, ee are flexible. We laughed at the rock shrimp which was smaller and actually worse than the popcorn shrimp at your local long John silvers. Really sad and incredibly dissapointing. The fish and chips were sub par. Nothing to get excited about at all.  Our bill was not enough to use our coupon so we ordered the caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes togo. It was three slices of normal tomatoes with three slices of cheese. If I were paying full price I would have been extremely angry.  Needless to say, the only thing we enjoyed about this place was the laugh we got from the lies on the menu.

My husband and I just got takeout from here. We will surly be back ASAP! We had the pineapple green curry with chicken and pad Thai (as well as crab puffs for my preggo craving) :) Everything we had was a spicy 1 and still had plenty of kick for me without being uncomfortable......and I like spicy! Glad we read the reviews and took it easy on the spicy. I can't wait to go back and try a buffet!

I found the most beautiful dress at Adore! Decy was just a sweetheart! I ended up coming back 3 times because I wanted to make sure that this was the dress for me and it WAS!!! I love the atmosphere or this store. It isn't commercial at ALL and there was absolutely zero pressure to make a purchase. She wanted to make sure I loved the dress and was very patient with me. Amazing selection of dresses in all different price ranges. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Had the forbidden rice with shaved steak, Mediterranean salad and side of Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were unreal! I could've eaten 3 plates by myself!!! The salad was yum and the rice dish was full of flavor! We will definitely be back!!!

Oh my goodness! Seriously amazing choices for breakfast! My hubby and I went last Saturday and sat at the bar. The other reviews are right about the service being a bit spotty at the bar, but we weren't in any rush.   We ordered lattes and they were small, but the amount of food you get makes up for that! We had the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes as a side, salmon omelette and portobello Benedict. Oh yeah.....and a side of chocolate covered bacon. Needless to say, I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day hahaha.   Aside from ordering WAY too much food, it was all excellent! When I go again, I will try all new items since there were so many amazing options. Will be back!
