I don't know how the average rating here is so low. This is a great spot with consistently great food.... At least for the teppan side. I've never eaten at just the sushi bar although I have had some and it's always been fine, no complaints.   I eat at Benihana very regularly and I have no complaints so I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good date night or fun dinner atmosphere. The vibe of the table can depend on your chef since they all have Their own personalities but overall it's usually a fun experience to match e great food.   I always go with the deluxe treats which is filet and lobster with the shrimp appetizer (included), a salad with amazing dressing and a soup also which is very good. I'd say all of the above are far better than their "competitors" like Ah-So, Sapporo, etc and usually better pricing.

Went to Abuelos with a party of 10 at 9:30pm so we were "those people" that are usually hated but we were at an event that didn't have good all evening. We were promptly seated and taken well care of. I have been coming to Abuelos for years now and it is definitely my top "upscale" Mexican restaurant.  The queso is always on point and never had anything I didn't enjoy. From the filet medallions, enchiladas, or the Durango chimichanga that is smothered in the queso. Everything has great flavor and service is always great.

I called the Roofing Consultants after the hail storm in Phoenix. They were extremely professional and courteous. They made this extremely frustrating process smooth and easy to handle. They did a wonderful job getting the work done on schedule and to my expectations. I would definitely refer Roofing Consultants of Arizona to anyone looking!

This is definitely my local go to taco spot! Best tacos and great prices. Most tacos are $2.50 each and they are loaded up with meat. I usually always go with the carnitas and their red sauce. They have a good habanero and green salsa as well. I've taken others that have gone with the crane asada or chicken and never heard anything but positive feedback on it.   They will also do catering on short notice. I had my team working on a Saturday at the office and was able to call him that morning and got the food delivered by 11am to our office. Everyone absolutely loved the food and asked that we use them again in the future instead of the other spots we've used in the past.   Service is always great as well. It's a order at the counter type of setup but they will let you leave the tab open and serve you in case you want to order drinks or more food because you loved the first plate so much.

Great spot for a perfect cut. I just started coming here but I am always pleased when I leave! Quality classic cuts and a beer while you wait. How can you beat that? TVs at each spot and a big screen on the back wall to watch the games. This is my new barber without a doubt.

Small diner type place but good quality food. I've had a breakfast burrito and biscuits and gravy. Both had good flavor and you can tell are made with quality product. They do serve Mimosas and bloody Mary's. This place has been on a few shows on food network and for good reason. Service wasn't the best I've ever had but it was decent. It was pretty quite when we were there so I don't think there was any reason not to have superb service.

Service was poor and food came out at all different times. I had flown in some clients and their wives. We went out to one of Evening Entertainment Group's clubs in Old Town and to RnR the next morning. One of the meals didn't even come out until after everyone else had finished. It was breakfast time, nothing special that should have caused such a horrible delay. No manager ever asked how our visit was or if there was anything that could be done. Typical management at EEG I guess; no concern for their customers.   "WARNING: DUE TO REPEATED, SEVERE, AND/OR NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS NOTED ON THIS INSPECTION LEGAL ACTION IS BEING INITIATED.

I will start by saying I am born and raised in Texas so I have very high expectations of BBQ. These expectations have not been met anywhere in Arizona until I tried Tom's Thumb. This is a great little spot inside of the car wash.   I did have one bad experience where the plastic wrap that they keep the meat in was actually INSIDE of my pulled pork sandwich. This was very disturbing to me and left a bad taste in my mouth. I was even more surprised that they did not do anything for me in this situation. This could have been a serious choking hazard and made someone sick if not kill them.   Never the less, the food is usually always great and they just had one mess up. I won't hold that against them forever because mistakes happen.   If you want some good BBQ this is the place to go!

Great breakfast spot! Right in the heart of old town scottsdale on scottsdale rd. So it's great to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery of old town. The waitresses are all very easy on the eyes. I usually go with the French toast and a mimosa or the omelette. Never been disappointed in any trip down there. Open 7 days a week so it's good spot any day.

Great new spot for made to order pizzas that come out in just 2 min fully cooked. Fresh ingredients and welcoming staff that is always helpful. Great idea, try it out you won't be disappointed.

Terrible service! The bartender guy is always terribly slow and unattentive. Today he said they don't open at 6am normal time that everyone else in this airport follows but instead at "6am airport time"... I fly multiple times a week and have never known the airport to run on a different clock than the rest of the world! I'll never be stopping at this place for their mediocre food and warm drinks again. PHX needs to replace you in T2!
