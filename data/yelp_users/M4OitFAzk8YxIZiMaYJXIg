Earl's!!!! I hadn't eaten here in years. Well I just went two days ago and I am happy to say it is still the same :). My two girlfriends did not want to go (they are way more posh then me) so I went by myself. Sadly the line was about 50+ in front of me. Could you believe I still waited? First let me say, this is one of the cheapest places on The Strip. Their sandwiches are still priced at $6.50 a pop. I always order the Holiday Turkey which comes with cranberry sauce. OMG. My mouth is watering right now as I write this... oh I also had the oatmeal raisin cookie to top it off (only $2) and that was phenomenal as well. If you have never experienced Earl's, it is a must when you attend Vegas. If you are reading this and debating it, just get off your phone and head over right now ;)

I have to say the only great thing about this place is that it stays open until 2am. At around midnight my friends and I worked up quite an appetite. We went to every restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and everyone was closed. We were very surprised, isn't this Vegas?!  So I give Blue Ribbon props for being the only place open in the hotel. However, the food was very pricey. Then again, it is Vegas and it is to be expected. I ordered the spicy tuna roll which was just average. It was very small and priced at $14. I had a severe allergic reaction to it which was not fun. I have never had that happen to me before when I have eaten sushi in the past. I want to say they may have perhaps mixed it on counters that were exposed to shellfish? I'm not really sure, but it was unfortunate. I also had the skewered meatballs which were tasted average. These were a bit more cheaper ($9) and came with quite a decent portion size. I would only recommend coming here if you need food this late at night!

This had to be the worst service I have ever received in Vegas. I was sitting at a table with a few attorneys and I can speak on their behalf when I say just how terrible this place was. Our waiter was extremely rude. I won't get too into details, but he never smile. At one point he filled one of our cups and spilled water all over the table and then simply walked off without trying to clean it or even apologizing. At the end 2 of the girls wanted ice cream so they ordered pistachio. When it came out, they each tried a scoop and had the same facial reaction. They told him it tasted more like green tea and it was not good at all (mind you, they were very nice about it). They asked to send it back and to have the vanilla instead - he literallly rolled his eyes and just stormed off. Upon his return he threw it down on the table and walked off.  Now, I know what you are thinking (if you are like me at least). You may read this review and think we had annoying people at our table giving him a hard time, but the truth is, this guy was just flat out rude. I mean from the very start you could tell he was having a terrible day. But the thing if, if you go to an expensive restaurant such as this, you should not have to tolerate the wait staff treating you like this.   Now onto the food.... hopefully, if you come to this place, you receive someone more friendly and more like your typical waiter/waitress in Vegas! Two people had the braised short rib which was delicious. I really wish I had ordered the same! The price was great too at $28. I had the Gnodi which were basically some sort of cheese balls ($20). They were okay, but they were quite cold which made it a little less appealing. I would advise against ordering the gnodi. And lastly, my other friend had the DOCG pizza which 3 of us tried at the table and none of us liked. He ordered it because they named it DOCG, so it should be good right? Completely bland. He kept taking the short rib from one of the girls and smearing it on the pizza lol. If you order that pizza, you may need to order a side of short rib :p

I was quite impressed with this 'Airport Restaurant'. I never would expect anything more than 3 stars during a layover. We had a 4 hour flight and when we landed at our layover in Phoenix, we were starving.   We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a go, seeing how crowded it was. There were plenty of other restaurants but I was sure this was the one.   We tried the California Burger, the breakfast burrito called the Zuni Burrito and lastly, the chocolate chip cookie with sea salt.   The California burger was perfect. The fries it came with were nice too. The burrito however was just average. It was a bit flavorless actually. I thought the hot sauce they provided with it would add more flavor, but sadly that was not the case. And the chocolate chip cookie was massive and amazing. I wish I could have one right now!
