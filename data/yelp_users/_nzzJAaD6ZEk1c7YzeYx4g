LENNY the man, the myth, the legend! This place is the best mom n pop burger shop in Phoenix! Lenny takes pride in his business, fun atmosphere, friendly happy staff and a delicious menu full of guilty eats n treats!   I'm not sure why people gave this place poor reviews? If you're looking for a healthy salad, this isn't the place for you. If you want the classic burger, hot dog, root beer float served with a side of old timer nostalgia this is deff the place to go!

I hate to give this place 2 stars, I went in with high hopes, but was disappointed and highly dissatisfied.  1) I had a 4pm apt and wasn't helped until 4:25pm 2) the lady that started filling my nails handed me off to another nail tech half way through  3) they know they have a great location for foot traffic and treat clients like a dint a dozen, so don't expect a friendly welcome or enjoyable/relaxing service  4) Upon going to pay they ask if you have cash and offer you a lower price for the service if you are willing to pay cash... I opted for that option as it was $5 less, but  did not get a receipt which seemed a bit shady.   This was my 1st time coming here and  I 100% won't be coming back. There are so many other places in the area with better prices and friendlier staff that I feel better about giving my money to than a place that won't even provide a receipt after awful service.

AWFUL WORK! Unless you are ok having to to buy new shoes I don't recommend taking your shoes here. A simple 3day repair dragged on to 3 weeks my shoes were spray painted, missing pieces, glued on cheap plastic and broke within minutes of walking in them... Long story short I wanted to support a small business but ended up having my $165 shoes destroyed and having a new pair.

The food is disgusting!   I order the the lox $8.75 the salmon was translucent, oily, stale and inedible  don't even want to know how old it was.  I also ordered the early bird sandwich $5 which included a microwaved square of pre frozen eggbeaters, 1 small piece of microwaved bacon, a soggy tomato, topped w a scoop of brown avocado squished between two tiny pieces of old bread.   The staff is extremely unorganized, the kitchen is dirty and the food is awful. Will NEVER return!

After not going here in over a year after the worlds worst experience with the worst server ruining my bday dinner I decided to give it another try and pleasantly surprised! The food, service and staff were amazing! Ask for Arnolodo if you go, he's extremely knowledgable, outgoing and takes pride in Sol!!! I will definitely be returning with family and friends :D    Great happy hour as well!

Ahhhhhmazing!!!!!!   The staff is so friendly and passionate about the menu! The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the food is by far the best Indian food I have ever had!   Must try the tikka masala with lamb, so flavorful and tender! The garlic naan is absolutely to die for!   Fair prices for the truly delicious and  authentic food you are getting.   I have been here 3x in the past month and can not say enough positive things about this restaurant! Do your tastebuds a favor and try this place ASAP, you'll have wished you had gone sooner!!!!!

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!! DISHONEST BUSINESS AND STAFF!!!    The employee Adalila stated my car needed a $120 clay bar service to remove tree sap from my car and the car would be ready in 40min. Upon my car going through the 3 min car wash all the sap was removed! No longer needing the clay bar I asked for my money back but stating I would pay and tip for the car wash. She showed me paint overspray and said the clay bar would still help. 1hr later I came back to pick up my car  and all the paint was there, now Adalila tried to change the story saying it was a chip but when the other employee came to see what the issue was he was able to remove the paint over spray proving the clay bar work was not preformed. Adalila said the car wash was closing for the day and I could return the following day for a refund or the work to actually be done.   Tuesday I returned for the refund, Adalila was nowhere to be found. Raul the manager that day looked at my car and agreed the clay bar was not preformed and would take 2-3hrs. He stated he could do the work but Roberto was his manager and could issue the refund the following day.   I returned again the following day for my refund and was meet by Roberto stating he could not issue a refund, but agreed the clay bar work wasn't done. Roberto began to say only the owner could issue the refund and he refused to let me speak with the 'mystery' owner and the the owner could not be contacted in regards to issuing a refund for a service not preformed. After arguing with Roberto for 45 min, he now refused any refund would be possible.  Livid after spending 3 days dealing with a promised refund and getting the run around by multiple 'management' level employees I left.  Outraged by the service and basically being robbed blind of my money I contacted the BBB. In addition I will be filling a civil case.

If you go here it's more than likely because you work in a surrounding office and you forgot to pack your own lunch or are too lazy to walk to Ocotillo and put something descent/healthy/un-processed in your body...  I have tried the bistro 7x... Each time disappointed in the quality, taste and price for nothing more than edible garbage.   Avoid entrees with the rubbery chicken at all costs. The chicken comes with grill marks without ever touching a grill. Magic?! NO... Just google 'fake char marks' for the full story behind that fast food trick.No local produce, dairy, meats or grains. The soups are loaded with salt and the salads are too pricey for the leafy brown let down that has been sitting in the walk-in fridge a good week past its sell by date.   Will the food kill you, no. Will you feel sick and bloated processing all the fillers and a artificial additives, probably.    Try the place, just don't go in with high hopes...
