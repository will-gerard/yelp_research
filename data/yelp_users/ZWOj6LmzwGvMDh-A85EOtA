Elegant dining room with European decor (think Versace silverware and big chandeliers) overlooking the Bellagio fountain.     I highly recommend the Taste of Jasmine pre-fixe menu -- 4 course meal with signature dishes like the stone crab claws, maine lobster, and peppered beef tenderloin.    I also enjoyed the soup sampler (minced chicken with corn, wonton and shark fin) and mango pudding dessert.

This review is for the SPA ONLY.   I was truly disappointed with my relaxation massage at the Bellagio. You would not expect less than pure perfection from a hotel of this caliber but unfortunately I left thinking how could they charge $130 for a 50 min painful and oily experience? I was literally covered in OIL including my face! The masseuse asked me if I wanted oil in my hair and I said that was fine but no one mentioned anything about my face?! I could even hear the amount of oil in her hands everytime she rubbed her hands together. It was disgusting! As for the pressure, she practically was digging into my muscles. It was literally painful. PAINFUL.   The facilities are nice but nothing to rave about - I mean where are the yummy healthy snacks like dried fruit and nuts? I will probably never book another appt here again. I'll just stick to the hotel accomodations.

to visit vegas twice in less than 3 months is impressive.  to stay for at least a week's time during each visit is painful.  thank you to venetian for making both of my work trips bearable.  from the all suites rooms to the various pools, from the shops (think palazzo and canal shoppes) to the award winning restaurants (think mario batali and wolfgang puck), from the gambling to the shows (loved jersey boys), venetian made me alittle happier while in vegas.  on my last day in vegas, the bf and i decided to do an early morning jog along the strip. we ran from the venetian to the new york new york hotel. while it was still hot at 8:30am, there wasn't much pedestrian traffic. however, we did run into a lady that was trying to hustle us to watch a show near the MGM. this was part of our conversation:  random lady: "hi are you guys married?" us: "nope" random lady: "oh, are you guys just living together then?" us: "nope" random lady: "ok..(long pause) well then that explains why you guys are so damn happy!" us: (laughing our asses off)  we definitely got a good laugh on that one. i guess you just never know what to expect (or hear) when you're in vegas!

this place was my go-to spot when i was hungry this week. i tried both breakfast (twice) and lunch (once) in a span of 4 days.  i highly recommend the steel cut oatmeal or the french toast for breakfast and the spinach with figs salad (top it off with grilled organic salmon) for lunch.

If you're in Vegas and you want buffet, then you go to the Bellagio for it. Period.

I am a huge fan of Theory clothes for women so you can imagine how happy I am when I visit any of the outlet stores. The merchandise is about 40-60% off the regular priced items but beware selection is limited especially in the smaller sizes.  This location is not too far from the strip (about 20 min cab ride from Bellagio). However, I don't really think the other stores at the Premium Outlets are worth the trip.

Shintaro offers teppanyaki, sushi and contemporary  tasting menus in the dining room. The sushi bar actually faces a kaleidoscopic display of live jellyfish.   I came here for the teppanyaki and it didn't disappoint.   I recommend the "land and sea" pre fixe ($85/person) which includes salad, miso soup, mixed vegetables, prawns, lobster tail, white fish, filet mignon and fried rice. The portions are quite generous so be prepared to eat a lot.

My friends and I were craving some preserved egg and pork congee so we stopped by Red 8 in the Wynn hotel.     I liked the Asian-inspired decor with its red latterns giving it a 1930's Shanghai art deco flair.    The congee was delicious as were the other dishes we ordered --sauteed string beans in XO sauce and green onion pancakes.    Red 8 is red hot!

The Wynn Esplanade has some of the most luxurious brand name stores and one of them is the lovely Shoe In boutique. This store carries a wonderful selection of Christian Louboutins. I want me a (few) pair(s) of Christian Louboutins.

Come to Japonais if you want top quality fish and I mean GRADE A+ SASHIMI. I've been to the several Nobus, Sushi Yasuda in NYC, Sasubune in LA, and Kiss Seafood in SF but I have to say this place is the best sashimi I've tasted. Thanks to our wonderful waitress Tomoko for her knowledgeable recommendations. Our meal wouldn't have been the same without her help!  Another favorite is "the Rock" -- this is probably a signature Japonais dish. You literally throw a slab of thinly sliced NY strip steak onto the hot rock and it cooks in less than 5 seconds. SO GOOD.  I will definitely come back and better yet, I now want to try the other locations in Chicago and NY.

the bf and i really enjoyed our dinner here. we started off with the sweet corn and fava bean salad as well as the oxtail boullion with bone marrow dumplings. both were fantastic!  for entrees, the bf opted for the 20 oz bone-in ribeye and i sampled the 8 oz filet mignon. again, both were really good but i liked mine just alittle tad more.  we also ordered a side of the fries and broccolini.   we were too stuffed for dessert but next time we will try to make room/  service was awesome too! our waiter recommended a terrific $22 glass of merlot. thank you!

Boo for Woo! Our party of 4 was NOT impressed with this restaurant -- the service was overwhelming to the point that it became annoying, the food was at best average, and the decor was nothing special.  Since the restaurant only opened 3 days ago, the dining guests were definitely outnumbered by the waiters. We had at least 4 people waiting on us. While normally that would be a good thing, that was not the case at Woo. We often felt rushed as they try to clear our table between dishes -- even in cases when we still had food on the plate! Our conversation was also interrupted at least on 2 occasions because the waiter just had to describe our dish to us.  Our main waiter kept upselling us on entrees and drinks too. He recommended that we order at least 2 of everything so that we could have a few bites of each dish as the portions were on the smaller side. Um hello, do you not see 4 relatively petite women at this table? He also seemed very particular about where we placed our glasses, plates, and utensils. He kept moving stuff around as if they were in the way of where he wanted to place the dishes.   all of the dishes were overpowered by the sauces -- either too much of it or just plain too sweet.  Oh and one final note...even the bathroom was rather unimpressing. the toilet seats were way too low and the toilet paper dispenser was not the easiest to use.  1 star for the view of the Wynn billboard from our table. 1 star for the $5 plate of vegetable fried rice.

Special shoutout and thanks to Marcus, our awesome bartender and Lucas, the man who hooked us up with what Oprah calls "the best-turkey burgers in the entire world" at the bar at DJT. Apparently these "mar-a-lago turkey burgers" are only available for in-suite dining but we were lucky enough to try them this afternoon! (see my posted pix!)  they tasted as good as I had hoped and maybe even better! the ground turkey burger had so much flavor (special ingredients include chopped celery and granny smith apples and chipotle tabasco) and is served on a delcious brioche-like hamburger bun with generous slices of fresh avocado and a side of seasoned fries. YUM!  for the actual recipe, go here: http://www2.oprah.com/foodhome/food/recipes/200805/food_20080516_burger.jhtml  On top of all that, Lucas took care of the bill for these burgers. Talk about class A service. Thanks again!!!  the bf also had the chelsea cocktail which includes fresh blackberries, mint leaves, sugar can 10 rum, and club soda. that drink was so refreshing and tasty that he ordered it twice.  even the bar snacks were addicting -- the bowl of wasabi covered gobi berries were our favorite.  we will be back again and we will try to eat at the DJT restaurant too!

A paradise for shopper's around the world! The new wing is like a mini mall within a mall. You'll find great stores like Marc Jacobs, Scoop NYC, Nanette Lepore, Fresh, Agent Provacateur, Theory, etc.     My highlight was seeing the cast of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy for a book signing! I'll post pix shortly :)

Thanks to Yelp we found this hidden gem! It's about 20 minutes outside of Phoenix but worth every mile drive from Sedona. We were craving authentic Chinese cuisine -- specifically hand pulled noodles and dumplings and we found Chou's Kitchen. Like some of the other Yelpers have said, please do a flash mob here to support local businesses. The owner lady is friendly and helpful with the dish recommendations. Please see my pics of the yummy pan fried beef buns, green onion pancakes, freshly made napa cabbage and pork dumplings, and the cold salad appetizer of parsley, green onions and jalapeños. Once seated, you will get a complimentary bowl of cornmeal porridge (very typical in Beijing cuisine). We would definitely come back if we are ever in the area.
