This restaurant is amazing! I love that they have options for people who aren't gluten free or vegan as well as those who are. The fig Gorgonzola pizza is delicious and so is the new spicy Thai red coconut curry pizza. This is a great place to go for lunch or with friends for dinner. They also have a juice bar and many of their ingredients are local.

Best customer service I've ever experienced. The owner helped my husband and I pick out a carrier for our son. She opened up several boxes and gave us a ton of info! Once we decided on a carrier, we picked out a design that we liked. After we got home, we realized that we had bought a toddler size carrier instead of a standard size. My husband brought it back and in typical guy fashion, he left his wallet at home! She was super helpful and apologetic about the carrier mix up and let him exchange it! We will definitely be back to support this small business. My only hope is that I have a girl soon, because they have the cutest clothes!

Went in on a Saturday (made an appointment) and was in and out in two hours with a great gel manicure and amazing pedicure! They were really busy so I would recommend calling first, especially on the weekend. Staff was friendly and helpful. If your looking for a low price nail salon with good quality check them out!!

I was not impressed with this location at all. The concept is great, but the experience was less than. We waited TWO hours for a table after being told that the wait was 60-90min. The menu was small, but everything sounded great. I ordered an antipasti appetizer and the sweet potato kale salad. The appetizer was soooo small and way overpriced for what we got. The salad, which I imagined being a healthy serving of kale topped with radishes and sweet potato (from the menu description), was tiny and the "sweet potato" was literally potato peeling shaving as a garnish. I was not expecting to pay $12 for a bowl of lettuce and a few pieces of kale. The other dish we ordered was the turkey pastrami, which was okay, but the fries were luke warm. After just two beers and the above food items we ended up paying almost $70 for a dinner that could have been made at home for under $20. I say don't waste your time or money going here unless its happy hour and not packed.

My husband and I came here. He had Tracey and I had Lily for therapists. Both of us had the same experience- one the best messages we've ever had.   We were both a little bit skeptical because the building and lobby don't give off the super swanky spa vibe that a lot of message places do. If you don't care about all that fancy stuff and just want a killer massage then this is the place for you. We will be back again!

Everything we have had is delicious. The dynamite roll was fabulous and we are so excited to have a new sushi place in the neighborhood.
