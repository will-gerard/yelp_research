I went in back in July of 2013 for an ablation surgery that did not work btw. I was told that it was going to be $2800 total when I asked for the total cost up front. After I made my appointment and spent $130 on a consult that I didn't get anything out of I decided to have it done anyway. So a few days before my appoint they call me and tell me that I have to pay an extra 50 for a prego., 250 for a test and 500 for sleeping meds. total cost 3400.00. Well over what I was told.   Day of surgery they had two male assistance that flew in from cali. to watch that I was not aware of until I was about to go in to the room and have surgery. I did not like the fact that I paid so much and they didn't even ask me before hand if I would mind. Once I got up from surgery they were trying to get me out which didn't make me to thrilled about my experience (zero recovery time) so I made sure to stay anyway and get some rest for about an hour and half.   I was called later and told that I over paid by 58.00 and that they would send a check out, it has been 4 months and I have not seen anything.    Overall I am not happy about the price, care or follow up and I am really unhappy that it did not work and if I want to try it again I have to pay another 3400. They should charge half so you can have it done twice just in case and they should let you rest after instead of okay your done get out.

My ex took me here a few years ago and when we walked in I thought to myself what the hell is he thinking and I refused to order anything, after he got his food he forced me to try it and I did. OMG it was so good we rushed back over and I ordered some tacos and have been hooked ever since.   The tacos are a little pricy and grease but they are the best, I have drove about 12 miles on a short lunch break just to get these addictive tacos. If you have never been you need to go but make sure it is after lunch and before 5.  Great food

I have been here a few times and I will continue to go because it is close to my work and I love gyro's. The gyro's are good (big full of meat) the fries are to thick for my taste and the soda is way to small for the price of the combo. Overall I am a fan but I think they can improve in some areas.

I have been going to this place probably since I was in the womb. They have good prices and good food. I love the chips and salsa. I wish they still did the cheese crisp on mondays for free after 5pm (maybe they will bring it back hint, hint)... It is in a smaller converted house in south phoenix with a take out area in front and a bar in the back. This place fills up quick on the weekends be prepared. Only thing I do not like is sitting out in the main area when you first walk in everybody is looking at you when they walk by I prefer the back room or the bar. YUMMY...... food try it for yourself.

I went here for the first time the other day and tried the gyro plate my son ordered the beef shawarma. Everything was good and the staff was very friendly and even gave us a sample of baklava. They give you a lot of food for cheap prices. I will be back.

This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix. If you want good Mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else.

I had to give a star because it's mandatory, but this place should not get one at all.  My friend and I ate here one night, we were practically alone in this dead restaurant. After the way were treated and the food I can see why it was dead.  The waitress took about 5 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink, then took about another 10 to take our dinner order. She told us that rice was not included with our meal and that we had to get it on the side at and extra cost, but the whole meal had rice so I don't know what she was trying to do. After she dropped off our food she came back and was trying to make me put my food on to another plate and got mad when I said no. Then about 20 minutes later she came back and asked if I wanted a box for the rest of my food and I told her no she got mad and didnt come back. We had to go up to the cashier and explain our order to him, right after we did that she finally came over and tried to get in the middle of everything.   This was the first time I ever had this type of food and at this place, I don't think I will ever try either again.

This is one of the only places I will go if I want to get a piercing. The staff is very friendly and educated in there art. If you want to get anything pierced and you are in the phoenix area stop in here.

Love the midwest best sammie on garlic bread. I wish they had more drink options, but other than that I love the taste.

The food was over priced and tasted like something you would get in a junior high cafeteria. The meat had no taste the salsa was blah. The decor was way to bright and over the top.   I will never go back and have told plenty of my friends not to try this place, save your money and go somewhere else.

I have been going to this place for a few years now. The food is great it is grilled with light seasoning and goes perfectly with warm flour tortillas. You might want to avoid going at lunch time because they are super busy and it is hard to get a seat.  If you work in the area call ahead and pick it up.

They have really good coffee here. My son picked it up and brought it home for me, so I have never been in to the actual store I have wanted it two more times since he brought it home to me, but both times must have been on a Sunday because they were closed.   Open Sunday too please.

The food is a little pricey, but not to bad. I have been twice to this place and the have really good food, clean and airy with pretty good service. I will continue to go back. I have never been for dinner so I gate rate the service or vibe at dinner time.

I have been here twice and both times I liked it. 1st sat at the bar and just had drinks with a friend, the staff was nice and quick.  The 2nd time I went I had lunch it was a little pricey because I went to early on a tuesday and had the honey hot -hot wings if it would have been wensday they would have been half the price. They were really good though and I plan on going in on a wed. for lunch.

I went here for a bday party a few months ago we took up most of the restaurant we had about 50 people.  The food was pretty good a little pricey and service was a little slow, but I think they normally do not have a ton of people to keep up with. Our waiter was nice and funny. I would go here again with a smaller group.  The place itself looked pretty cool.

I like to go here sometimes on friday nights with friends. They have a very young college seen and the drinks and  great drink specials on friday between 9-12 you can pay 10 dollars to get all the drinks you want. This is a great starter bar I have never been on any other night though.

We were starving one night and thought we would try this place out, not the best idea we had. The food is gross and over priced, and the service is bad. The only thing that we liked was the band.   This might be an alright place to have a drink but don't eat here.

Great food. I always get the chicken pasta and it is great oh and the lemonade is the best. If you are in the area you should really check this place out.   The only down fall is the seating inside, it sort feels like a cafeteria, but other than that I think this place is great.

I have been here 2 times and the food has been good and cheap both times. I like that you can pick different things and that it is a good amount of food. I am pretty new to eating sushi so the quality here seems to be good.  The wait can be pretty long so go before you are really hungry.

I have been to this location 2 times during lunch because it is close to my work. I didn't think the service was that great either time. The food is good though. I will probably be back to this location unfortunately because there is not much around this area to eat when you only get an hour for lunch.

Love this place they have good prices and good food and it has always been clean. I go here about twice a month always get #4 with veggies. Very yummy. After you leave give yourself a little treat and have one of the deserts from the vendor right outside for .75 you cant go wrong.

I have been taking my dog cruella here for about two years now, I have always had good service and she always looks the way I want. I have even made appointments at the last minute and Hy has done a great job and made time for me.  If you don't like paying the high fees at other places then give Hy a try.

I went with a friend over here after work one night on a recommendation. I loved my food it was much bigger than I thought and more gourmet to. I was expecting a little cheese crisp filled with meat, but it was so much more than that. I had a margarita that was really good but I think it was grapefruit all it says on the menu is margarita's but no description of any of them.  The place was very tiny and cramped, but it was colorful in a good way and was not super busy. The service was a little slow and it was our first time so it took a while before they told us you get your sauce's from the little bar.  I will be back in the future, overall it was a good price and taste food.

I have been to this place a few times to go dancing on Saturday nights. It is not very big and never very busy but I always have a good time and good service.  I have only been in the bar section and back patio.

Loved the food here went for the first time about a month ago and went back again about 2 weeks ago. They have pretty good prices, clean and friendly staff. If you have never been before and are not sure what to order I found that there online menu has pictures which is really helpful. I wanted to get what I got the first time but I didnt remember the name and was not very good at explaining what it was so I ended up with something different, but it was very good too.

I really like the ribs, turkey, sausage and breakfast taco's. I have ate here quite a few times since they opened a few years ago. The price is a little high and I do not like the set up being so open if you eat in the restaurant.

I was looking for a bike for a couple of months before I came across this place. I bought a bike for a great price, they made sure it was tuned up and changed the seat for me at no charge the owner even sold me his own personal phone holder that is attached to the handle bars. I will be back.

I have only been here once, but I thought it was laid out pretty well and I liked the selection of clothes. I bought a little black dress that I love for about 16 dollars. I have not tried to sell anything in here so I can not comment on that. Overall I think it is a cool place to find clothes and the sales people seemed pretty chill.

I stopped here this morning to get pool sand and o-rings for my pool. The place was very clean and organized and the staff was very friendly. I wish I would have known about this place years ago when I bought my house in 2007, it is about 5 mins. away. This place is off the beaten path by worth looking for, the prices are good.

The food is amazing and the indoor and out seating is good. The prices are a little bit high and the wait is normally long but the food is worth it. If you are in Tempe you need to try this place just make sure you bring change for the meter and bring a friend so they can sign in while you find parking.
