The garden is lovely and they do some fun events here. I have brought out of town guests here and I recently attended a wedding in the garden which was lovely. The luminarias in December are well worth a visit.  The cafe has some good food options and the prices are fair. Their plant sale is also very good and my mother goes every year. I can't wait for the temperatures to cool down a bit so we can go and enjoy the gardens some more!

I won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place. But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.  We came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking.   You can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says "Ok, that's $3." I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.  When I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said "Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there." Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said "Oh" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.  At this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely "We don't have any more." and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass.   Seriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy.   And as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back.

Always great, knowledgeable service when they work on our regulators. Great people working there who never try to oversell you on equipment and their salt water, heated pool is awesome for refresher courses!

The staff here and the PTs are excellent! I have been seeing them since 2009 and this year, despite multiple injuries and a very rigorous training schedule, they managed to keep me healthy enough to complete an Ironman race. They are wonderful for injury management and prevention and for rehab after surgery or other injury. I absolutely love this place and they are truly a part of my regular training and fitness to keep me in top competition shape.

This place is in the same complex as my nail salon but I have not stopped in to this location. I have been to their Scottsdale location and love it!  This location does not disappoint. Service is quick and while they prefer cash, the ATM is on site and they offer a discount if you pay cash so no problem. I had the Nam Sod and ordered it Thai hot and yes it was! I hate when I order "Thai hot" and it comes out just a little fiery. Make me sweat, people!   The texture was lovely, it wasn't dry and the serving was huge! I easily could have shared it and ended up with two meals out of it. I will definitely make this a post-nail appointment dining spot from now on.

This is another home run from the people who brought us such wonderful places as Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill.   Liberty Market is excellent for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or just coffee. Yes, I know because I spent many a day/morning/night studying for the bar exam here. They have a nice selection of beers and wine for dinner (or a particularly heinous lunch study session). For lunch, the Maiden Lane sandwich or the Farmer are my favourites and their pasta salad is an excellent side.   For dinner, burgers are always good but so is the "Best Chicken Sandwich" which really is very good. For dessert, I always like their homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich with a glass of champagne.   The market is also really nice for cute gifts and food items. Also, check out the bathrooms, seriously. Very clever and cute.  This place is awesome but expect to wait if it's during peak hours.

My waistline doesn't want to admit it, but I am a regular here, coming in about once every week to two weeks. I love the Colorado red chili, the green chili pork, the carne asada, their hot salsa, Cali burrito....really, the list goes on and on. The burritos are huge and really reasonably-priced. Everyone that works here is super friendly and most days when I pick up my order, someone is sitting there chopping away at delicious fresh onions, tomatoes, peppers for the various dishes. They have a very extensive menu and I really need to try some of the tacos and other items but the burritos are just so darn good! Their patio is covered and not very large but we usually just order ours for pick up and eat at home. I have never been there when there wasn't some form of line but the wait isn't all that long for the food.   They have free wi-fi, amazing, quality ingredients, they don't skimp on the meat and fillings in the burritos, either. I will definitely keep coming here.

They've been spraying at our house for over a year and we have been very happy. We had a horrible black widow problem, as in, we would kill a dozen a night on the back patio, within a week of them starting our service, they were gone entirely. And they haven't been back which is more important. We do sometimes get an earwig in the house but that's because I don't have the indoor service because I have a parrot. They always call me the day before to check and be sure it's okay to spray and remind me to leave the dogs in and they always leave my invoice on my door. I have not had any problems with them at all and I carefully read all warranties and fine print and think they are a good company. I also got quotes from other companies before going with AZ Exterminating.   I also love that even though the yard gets sprayed, I have not seen any dead lizards which is a good thing! We still have them on our walls and geckos in the garage which is fine by me. We don't have as many, which is also fine by me because it means there is less for them to eat which = fewer bugs! The only thing I am sort of sad about is that our lovely, roaming female wolf spider who would valiantly take down some of our black widows is gone and she hasn't been back with any offspring. My guess is she was an unfortunate unintended victim. :(

I went here the other night after a nearly 18 month absence (not because of anything wrong with this place but because I had graduated from law school and wasn't in the area as often) and am glad I did!   I remembered why I love this place: the service is friendly, the food is good, the prices are fair. It wasn't very busy on a Thursday evening so I had the pick of any table I wanted. One of the owners bustled over with water right away and took my drink order. I wanted a Blue Himalayan beer but she told me that they were out but she made a suggestion of a similar beer, the Flying Horse, and it was prefect with the food. I ordered garlic naan, basmati rice and chicken vindaloo. The flavors are all great but here's what I love about this place: when I say "Indian hot, please" they bring it to me Indian hot. She only raised one eyebrow and repeated back "Indian hot?" And when I nodded, she smiled and away she went.   I loved the spice on my vindaloo and the beer that she suggested worked well to cool me down as I was eating. I love that the heat doesn't hide the amazing flavors in their dishes. The portions are generous and I had a good dinner and a large lunch out of my meal. The lamb saag is also excellent and I have had their biryanis in the past as well. This is a solid place to go and I am glad to have rediscovered it after a long time away.

Everyone at this salon is super professional, friendly and great at what they do. I have been going here for over 10 years and have used them for cuts, colour, waxing, up-dos, etc. as has my mother and some friends.  Appointments in advance are necessary as they book fast since they are all so awesome at their jobs! The place is really neat and clean, comfortable, homey and with cute decor. They also have a wide selection of products to buy.   I highly recommend them for all your style needs!

We dined here last night and were very impressed with the place. We made a reservation and I'm glad we did because it was pretty busy when we arrived; however, we spied a bar where people seemed to be waiting. The decor is nice and the place is homey and comfortable without being cramped. I don't think there really is a bad table in the house.   Service was excellent, friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and wine list. The wine list was impressive with some very unique offerings. We ordered a lovely bottle of white and I love that our waiter brought the ice bucket without having to be asked. Little touches like that make this a lovely place. (I also love any Italian restaurant that doesn't have the words "meatball", "spaghetti" and "marinara" on it; all these words are wonderfully absent)  I had the pappardelle mari e monti which was a spinach pasta served with scallops and a porcini tomato sauce. It was excellent. The pasta was cooked very well and still had a bite. The scallops were well done and the sauce, with burst cherry tomatoes and porcini mushrooms complimented the scallops beautifully.   My husband had the squid ink pasta which is a fairly new item on their menu, we learned. The seafood was all cooked very well and the pasta was again properly cooked with a nice bite. The flavors were good but my husband was hoping for more of a distinctive flavor from the squid ink.   We will definitely be coming back to enjoy their brick oven pizzas which looked excellent and their chocolate souffle.

I love the Phoenician. The grounds are wonderfully maintained and beautiful, the staff is impeccable and the amenities are great. This review is for high tea, though, specifically. I enjoyed high tea yesterday with a girlfriend and it was wonderful. It's so fun to put on your sun hat, your tea gloves and enjoy feeling pampered and posh. They do a great job and their tea menu is very good with many different offerings, the settings are lovely and the food is very good. We both had the Grand Royale Tea which included unlimited sparkling wine and tea plus the three course tea menu.  Their finger sandwiches are very good, though, I wanted a little more salmon on my smoked salmon offering. I enjoyed the ham and asparagus one and the chicken salad was lovely. The scones were amazing and their homemade lemon curd went wonderfully on the cranberry one. For the pastry course, the paris brest was alright, I've had better, but the creme puffs were excellent. I could have had one of each of the amazing selection but I tried very hard not to give in to too much temptation.  It is pricey and gratuity, at 22%, is added in, but what a lovely way to splurge! Dress your best, bring your girlfriends and enjoy afternoon tea.

So disappointed in my latest visit to Kazimierz. I have been here before for live jazz and really enjoyed it. I liked the flights and the food.  However, we went here Sunday and I was sorely disappointed. Firstly, we picked it because a local website said they do Flamenco music on Sundays. I should have checked the website of Kazimierz itself since there was no flamenco music. That part is not their fault. What is their fault is that the band they did have was, frankly, below average. A guy on drums, a guy on guitar sort of muttering very quietly into a mic for a few minutes between sitting with his buddies drinking for about fifteen minutes. Not worth a $5 cover, folks. Get some real talent in here, please or don't charge me the cover to watch the "band" drink and goof off with their friends at the table next to me.   Secondly, we walk in and the place is totally done up in Christmas decorations. It just really cheapened the whole place and I don't remember this place being so kitsch. I felt sort of gross and like I was in a bad sitcom. My first visit here was sort of that magical experience of finding somewhere unique with a great atmosphere of elegance, chic but relaxed at the same time. Now, seriously, I wanted to laugh out loud when I walked in the door.  Thirdly, service was awful. Slow, snobby and inattentive. I don't recall that from my past visits. Our waitress was seriously abysmal and more than once I was tempted to flag down someone else since she was just so cold, unhelpful and unfriendly. Do you want me to order more so I can give you a bigger tip or don't you?   Fourthly, we really wanted to have some cheese with our wine so we asked for a food menu and were told, oh, yeah, we closed the kitchen early tonight. Just as an FYI, the bouncer taking my cover charge should have said something, or your website should have said something, or the server should have said something when she first graced us with her presence. We were there at 9, not that late, seriously. I have checked their website and there was nothing about them closing early, a little miffed about that.  So, overall, pretty disappointing and I have to say while it's dressed up like someone's trailer park, I don't think I'll come back to spend a lot of money on some average local band someone knows and bad service even if the wine is good.  The one thing I liked was the Tour de France flights they had offered since it is that time of year. I'm still giving it 2 stars because I have had a good time here in the past.

This is always a good choice! Get there early for lunch since this place fills up fast and seating is at a premium. I have never had anything here that wasn't good and portions are large and are easy to share. Staff is friendly, service is quick and prices are very fair. The grocery store attached is awesome for picking up some of the harder to find ingredients one might need for North African or Middle Eastern cuisine (Israeli cous-cous being the one I always get here).

I love this place. I've enjoyed their galettes before but on this latest excursion, it was midnight and we were coming from Mabel's on Main so I was in the mood for something a little more. Husband and I split the Brisas burger. I love the idea that you can split the burgers because half of one with a serving of waffle fries is more than enough for a meal! The burger was juicy, cooked the way we ordered and had just the right amount of spice.  This is a great place for lunch, dinner or a late night bite after a fun night out. Service was a little indifferent but not incompetent. I'll be back again.

I don't like to give 5 stars especially when it's my first time somewhere but this place gets it. It smells so amazing when you walk in, fresh baked bread and goodies, yum!!!!!! The menu is expansive and you can find something for everyone. I got a grilled pork banh mi and an order of spring rolls. The banh mi was amazing! Pork was so juicy and tender and had great flavor. The bread was just right: chewy but with that great baguette crunch. I loved the amount of veggies they put on: perfect balance of the flavors and great crunch from them. Good heat from the jalepenos, though I wound up adding hot sauce, too.   Spring rolls weren't as good as I've had but did not skimp on the shrimp and were tasty enough. Prices are amazing and the food is ready super fast! They also have ice cream which they were nice enough to let me sample. The Taro flavor is awesome! I can't wait to come back and get a cone.   Note: they only take cash but they do have an ATM inside. Great place and I will definitely come back.

The food is pretty decent but this place had some seriously bad service and was incredibly loud and was absolutely frigid inside. The menu is pizza, salad, calzones. The mediterranean salad with chicken is pretty decent and is good sized. The individual pizzas are ginormous! I like the thin crust and the sauce. However, we went here with a group and while we were seated promptly, that was about it. Every single thing was screwed up at least once. All the drink orders was screwed up and given to the wrong people. Salads were given to the wrong people or not brought out at all. The waiter totally forgot to even bring out one salad and one pizza for two different people. He gave one woman another person's pizza and was a little miffed when these errors were pointed out. A manager did come to apologize but still. Also, it was extremely loud and we ended up getting out as soon as we could. And it was freezing in there, too! The wait for food was not too long but the wait for the corrected food was a little ridiculous but mainly because they had to either remake things or make them for the first time since the orders were placed so incorrectly with the kitchen. Would not come back.

Everyone that works here is friendly and very knowledgable. They are so encouraging, as well! They can order you pretty much anything you need and I love that they are so active in the Arizona tri community. As a still fairly new triathlete, they have been a great resource for me and have offered me advice and tips. I love this place.

Love, love, love, It's rare a restaurant group can have solid entries in multiple categories but in the case of our friends at the Joe's family, they have done it. Joe's Real BBQ does not disappoint. The big downside is no alcohol, however, order ahead, pick it up and head home.   I have been in with just my husband, a group for a family dinner, taken out for just myself and for a party of 8 and have been pleased every time. It does get busy at peak hours and it's very much like traditional BBQ places in the south as in, you stand in line at the counter, get your food and off you go to your table. The homemade sauces, especially the spicy, are great and they also have nice homemade root beer.   I wish they had more side dish options but the ones they have are very good. I almost always get the stuffed baker (hi, giant baked potato with bbq meat on top, how is this bad?!) but I have tried nearly everything on the menu via my husband, family and friends.   These people also are soooo friendly and helpful. I called the three hours before a large party and needed a bunch of food ready and waiting and they said "no problem" and it wasn't. It was all ready when I went to pick it up with extra things of sauce thrown in. Prices are fair, too.

Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.

Meh. Seriously, meh. I would never have chosen to come here on my own but my office group picked here for our end-of-year luncheon so I was sort of obligated. It's just kind of....well....it's gross, frankly. I already get weirded out by buffets but this one was really gross. The "sushi" is so disgusting and nothing is labeled so you have no idea what you're even putting on your plate since many of them are fried, which means they are soggy since they've been sitting out god knows how long. The order to things is bizarre. They have donuts next to shrimp next to fried rice and apple pie next to pizza but then they have a whole separate section for desserts? The food was bland, oily and lukewarm. Ugh, never again. If my work picks this place again, I'll feign the stomach flu.

I came here for lunch and I would like to come back and try something else and maybe revise my review but this first experience was just so blah. I wanted soup because, honestly, my office is so stinking cold I needed to warm up. I was torn between two soups: the tortilla and the chicken chili. The woman at the counter was very nice and gave me a taste of both. They were both fairly bland and average. I decided on the chicken chili and ordered it in a bread boule.   The soup was just so bland. It was salt, some corn starch to make it have that weird gelatinous texture thing going on and it was lacking in substance. Some little shredded pieces of chicken and that's about it. I wanted some green chilis!! Or anything really to add some flavor. The bread was ok. Not great, not terrible.   Overall, I was fairly disappointed but I would be willing to give it another shot and try something different on the menu. The menu is pretty varied, which was a good thing.

I regret that I have to spend time in the ER but I am glad that it was at such a nice facility. I was in the ER for a badly broken arm shortly after the hospital opened and the triage staff and ER doctors were excellent. I was treated very quickly and the discharge process was quick and easy. The second time I was in the Mercy ER was after a car accident and I was brought by ambulance. The staff that met my ambulance team was excellent and I was quickly evaluated and given a room where my family could wait with me while x-rays, tests, etc were conducted. They even had a therapy dog visiting that night and it was very nice to be able to sit with him while I was being patched up and helped me feel not quite so shaky and panicky about what had just happened. (Hit by another driver who ran a light, car was totalled). My entire visit was very smooth and I felt like everyone in the ER knew their roles and what they needed to do. I also had to get my medical records after the accident for my attorneys and their records department was very friendly and helpful and it was very quick and easy to get my records and also to have them sent to my orthopedic surgeon. I hope I never have to go to the ER again but I would definitely recommend Mercy Gilbert.

So glad we got to try this place! A girlfriend and I went here last night for a late supper and wine and it was very nice. Firstly, what great service! We called them at 8:40 and told them we were on our way. They told us the kitchen closed at 9 but they'd wait for us. We got there at 8:55 and felt like we needed to rush. The server and hostess told us not to worry at all, to take our time and left us with the menus. They came back to take our wine order and didn't rush us on the food order at all. The wine list was pretty good though I was sad that I didn't see any local wine offerings. We sat out on the patio which was very large and really nice with views of the surrounding mountains and the "fire bowls" (I have no idea how else to describe them) were a very nice touch.  I enjoyed a glass of the Montepulciano and the pour was generous. It was a nice glass to have with my meal.  Food was great and came out really fast! I had the spinach and strawberry salad and added sirloin (I like alliteration in my food, apparently). The regular sized salad is gigantic! I had half for dinner and half for lunch today. The flavors in the salad were awesome; the goat cheese was mild and not over-powering, the spinach was very fresh and not wilty at all, steak was well cut and cooked with no fatty bits or gristle and the dressing worked together to balance the sweetness of the strawberries with the tang of the cheese and the mild spice of the beef.   It's a far drive for me but I am sure I will be there again when I'm up that way visiting friends.

This is always a good option and I've been here for breakfast, brunch and lunch. The service is always fast and everyone is always very friendly. I love their egg white omelets and their sandwiches are very large and come with fruit, their side salad and the First Watch Potatoes so you get an ample amount of food and the prices are really quite good considering you really do get two meals out of their portions. Their menu is pretty diverse and has some interesting options on it and they will make substitutions as you need or request. I also love that their nutrition information is on their website so you can make a better choice if you want, or just splurge.   It can get busy on weekends but it's a very nice little place to enjoy some good food at good prices and with friendly staff.

Amazing selection of beer! Good specials, too. I was able to find my favourite Maui Brewing Company Mana Wheat here which made my day! The food is very good and portions are more than ample so you can easily split something or just have a lunch for yourself the next day. Service is really friendly and the vibe in here is really relaxed and fun. I came in after a race and didn't feel at all out of place in my racing gear and all sweaty and tired. My new favourite post-race place!

We stopped in here after dinner in the area. Even though we'd already eaten, I always like to look at menus to see if it's a place worth coming to for food. Their menu looked excellent with some very unique takes on typical bar food. The beers are interesting and there is a great variety of offerings. The prices are really good for their drinks and the pours in the mixed drinks are generous. Also, Kim, the bartender, is awesome! I caught that they had undercharged us on our bill and when I brought it to her attention, she just smiled and said "No big deal! Don't worry about it!" She got a big tip. The patio is also dog friendly and huge! This is a really fun place where a lot of people seem to be regulars and it was definitely hopping. I would come here again for sure.

This is a great place! The pedis are awesome and they do such a great job on nails. I always get pink/white gel and I have never lost one even though I ride horses, SCUBA dive and travel and use my hands all the time. They also do great nail art (I always get nail art on my big toe). Their waxing rooms are very nice. The whole place is always very clean and the techs are excellent. Without an appointment, you do have to be ready to wait, though and it can be pricey but I think the quality is worth the price you pay. I'm a regular here.

I went here for happy hour with a girlfriend and we sat out on the patio. I liked that they didn't try to cram too many tables onto the patio and it was comfortable to sit out there without feeling crowded. Their drink specials are good. I had their red and their white sangria (hey I wanted to try both) and I thought the white was better.   I enjoyed the beet salad which was excellent, very fresh and a good size. The flavors were really good. My friend and I split some bruschetta: the smoked prosciuto was good though I couldn't really taste the truffle oil; roasted artichoke, eh, it was just ok; roasted garlic with goat cheese and arugula was excellent. I loved the spicy bite of the arugula with the sweetness of the balsamic.   I would come back here for another glass of sangria and to try some more menu items. Onnly bad thing was the service was iffy; server was not very friendly and wasn't very attentive. But she did bring the check promptly when asked so not terrible.

This was my first taste of Vietnamese and this was a wonderufl introduction to the cuisine. The decor is very modern and classy without feeling cold or unfriendly.  I did like that there seemed to be a lot of regulars in the place which bodes well, to me, that the food will be very good. The service was a little indifferent but fast and competent.  The spring rolls were excellent and so far have been the best I've had. The bun was good, but after dining at Noodles Ranch, the bun there is better. The Pho was excellent; the broth was lovely and the cuts of meat were nice and lean and in the right size to enjoy without a struggle. The portions were very ample and my husband and I each got an extra meal out of them. The prices seemed very fair to me for how much food you get. I am looking forward to coming here again to try some more of their menu offerings!

I have been here for breakfast, lunch, dinner and just for shopping for gifts. I love this place. The quality of the ingredients is excellent and as much as they can, they use local so you can feel good about your meal, too.   Their sandwiches are all lovely (the fresh bread is great and it's worth picking up a loaf while you're in the shop). For dinner, I have enjoyed their chicken lasagna that utilizes the Meyer lemon olive oil which gives it a really nice, fresh taste (buy a bottle to take home and enjoy it on chicken, veggies and fish). i love their olive oil cupcakes and we typically get one to share between my husband and I. They also have an almond champagne (really a sparkling wine) that is simply lovely! On Saturdays and Sundays there is live music and wine tasting which is a nice way to round out a brunch or lunch or dinner. The patio is great and the picnic tables out in the olive trees are also ample. It can get very very crowded so arrive early and be ready to share your picnic table or bring a blanket and sit on the grass. They do have heaters outside and some tables inside if you are cold adverse. The lights on the patio add a nice atmosphere. To those referring to off-roading or dirt roads, you do have to drive on a gravel driveway and the parking lot is gravel. It's really not that hard or rustic of a drive at all. We are here once every couple of weeks and are always happy.   Portions are decently-sized and the olive oil potato chips that come with sandwiches are really nice and light. I also did a ton of holiday shopping there and got something for everyone. Their fig and caramelized onion tapenade is amazing. Overall, this is a very nice, different, friendly place if you can avoid the crowds!

I love this shop. My husband and I bought shoes in May, both new brands/styles from our normal based on the advice of the staff. We wore them for about 60 days; I trained decently hard in mine and we just weren't feeling it. Enter the VIP perk. We are VIP members which allowed us to bring the shoes back and try again. The staff spent lots of time with us making sure we got the shoes we would be very happy with this time.   The Adventure Runs are great, the member perks are great, everyone is friendly and supportive, they have clinics, etc. I love coming here and will keep coming back.

I will be coming back here again and again. It is rare that I have so much trouble ordering because everything tempts my palate but here, that was the case with Cork (I wanted to try everything on the menu!)  Firstly, this is a classic small plates restaurant (3 oz of your proteins). Those of you who enjoy Olive Garden endless pasta bowls need not apply. However, for an amazing journey of flavors spread over several small courses and an amazing wine list, come on in!  The place is not huge so I would recommend reservations during peak hours. We came in for a late dinner with a reservation and were seated at a nice sized booth. Winston is great as a server so ask for him if he's working; his knowledge of the menu and wines was very good.   We had a hot and cold starter: the Lion's Paw scallop is wonderful and the sweet potato puree it's served on was a perfect compliment. I was worried how the pork confit would go with it but it was a very nice touch. Our cold starter was a special that night: a beef roulade stuffed with lobster and red peppers and topped with caviar. It was very good but the scallop stole the show in this course.   Salads: We ordered the baby spinach and the organic field greens. The field greens with its interesting combination of the spiced caramel popcorn and blue cheese was very good but the baby spinah salad was phenomenal. I would come back just for this dish! A bed of perfect baby spinach topped with shallots and a warm sherry vinaigrette with large pieces of smoky bacon all topped with a perfectly poached egg and served with a crostini spread with pesto! So. Good. The salads were big enough for two to share one, I think.   As a main course, I enjoyed the elk loin which was perfectly cooked at medium rare-rare and the boar risotto was nice. I enjoyed the brussel sprouts but thought my husbands celery root hash was better. He enjoyed the beef short rib which was amazing with its two generously sized poached crab legs. We did not leave overly stuffed but were very satisfied.  This is a pricey place at dinner and best for a special night but the food is so good! We will definitely be back!

I came here for a quick lunch and really enjoyed it. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and am glad I finally got to. Their menu, for lunch at least, is a little sparse and I was sort of bummed to see pad thai, but not nam sod, one of my favourites. Their lunch portions are still good-sized and service is fast. I ordered my meal, pad kee mau, not my normal but I was in the mood for those thick rice noodles, Thai hot and it was hot but still not as hot as they make it for me at Swaddee so that remains my go-to for truly hot Thai food. Their flavors, though, are excellent and they really do a good job with their food. I will definitely come back here to enjoy a more prolonged, relaxed dinner since when I was here, I had very limited time. Service is ok; food came out quickly. The ingredients all tasted pretty fresh and the blend of flavors was spot on in my dish and my husband's basil leaf chicken.

This is a great little joint. We stopped in here with some friends on a whim shortly before closing time but they still had all the flavors out and the staff was very nice, despite it being a few minutes before close. They were very nice about letting us try a few different flavors before ordering. I finally decided on the salted caramel which was excellent. My husband got the guiness chocolate and we another friend got the cinnamon. We all tried the bacon ice cream which was very unique and not bad at all. I tried the blue cheese ice cream and while it was good, I'm not sure I could do a whole scoop of it! They had some wonderful looking ice cream sandwiches with big cookies that I would like to try next time. I will definitely stop by here again.

We dined here for the first time on Saturday. It was ok. Not great, not awful, ok. The prices were decent, I thought, but they also have coupons on their website so check that out.   We had the Gyoza to start which had a nice texture and subtle, but good flavors. It was a little oily but, hey, they are fried so it's to be expected. We ordered a bunch of different rolls and some were good, some were ok, some were disappointing.  My favourite was the ladybug and the sriracha/sweet sauce on the plate. I loved that spiciness with the tuna! Yum!! We also had the caterpillar and dragon which were just meh. The spicy salmon was disappointing because it had zero spice to it. We should have asked them to make it more spicy.   The sushi rice was inconsistent. On some rolls there was way too much, on some it wasn't wrapped tightly enough so it fell apart and on some the texture was way too gummy and gooey.   I would like to try Sushiya again and try some different rolls, specify spicy and maybe try some other things on their menu because it's awfully close to my house and the prices were decent. Not a bad place, but not really that great, either. Just meh.

George is great!!! He was running a little late and made sure to call me well before the scheduled time to let me know. When he arrived he was very honest about what he could do for our old, original, dingy carpets but I think he did a great job on them! He made them look so much better and that musty smell is gone now, too. He was very honest when I asked about doing our grout and gave me a great recommendation and coupon for another provider. He is friendly, has great prices, is attentive to detail and overall did a wonderful job!

We came here after an event at US Airways Center. I hadn't eaten yet and at 11 at night, my options were getting sparse but this place, thank goodness, cooks until 1.   We enjoyed the beet salad and the prosciutto di parma pizza. We split the beet salad and weren't able to finish each of our portions and the pizza was huge! We were able to munch on it for 2 days after. Food prices are good, drink prices a little steep.  I loved the atmosphere in this place and enjoyed sitting in one of the secluded corners on one of the unique settees set around the place. I would come back here again, for sure. Overall, a nice vibe and good food. Service was good.

This is an excellent steakhouse that doesn't break the bank like some of the top-end places do. We first went to Keg on our honeymoon in Whistler, B.C. and loved it. The food is very good and their steaks are a good quality in both cut and taste. The staff is professional and knowledgeable and steaks actually come out the way you asked!   Their escargot is pretty good, not amazing, but pretty good. We really like the mushrooms neptune, too. Their wedge salad is good and is nice to share before dinner. Their portions on both steak and sides are ample. We have always enjoyed our meals here. I will say, I am always a little shocked when I get the bill but that's ok, we consider this to be a "nice night out" without having to travel far from home.

First off, their side sauces are really nothing exciting. I was very disappointed in them. It's also pricey, but the quality of the food does match the price for the most part.   It gets four and not 3 stars for a couple of reasons. It's got a lovely atmosphere; it's very contemporary without feeling cold and unwelcome. They also have a raw bar that had some great oyster options. The clincher for me, though, was the foie gras terrine. It was simply superb. Served warm with crusty bread and rhubarb chutney, I could have eaten the whole thing myself but for the sake of my waistline, I'm glad we were sharing amongst friends. The foie gras was sweet and decadent.  Finally, the steaks were good but were no better than any other nice steak house but they had two sides that were very good and made it be a 4-star meal: their potato gratin is simply excellent and their mac and cheese was also very good. We ordered several sides and shared them amongst 6 people and everyone definitely got a good taste of everything. I think sharing a side between two or three would be perfect. Good wine list, good cocktails.  It's worth the trip.

The Mesa location doesn't have quite the quaint charm of the Tempe location but the food is still great and the patio is ample. All the pasties on the menu are very good and the traditional ones do stay very true to the Old Country recipes. The dessert pasties are worth a try if you have room. I also enjoy picking up the ones you can finish baking at home. Drink prices are always good and they normally have specials going. My favourite is the Shepherd's Pie or the Bangers and Mash. Ask for extra red-wine gravy.

Lentil fetoosh. That's all you need to know. Seriously one of the things I crave with that lemon dressing and the caramelized onions, it's so good! Actually, I've never had a bad meal here. I get take-out here quite frequently after the gym or yoga and have had most of the salads and a few of the pitas. The service is quick for take-out or dining in, the employees are always friendly and the food is consistently good. Servings are very large so you can easily get two meals out of most things.

I have a monthly unlimited membership here and I love this place. It's visually stunning and such a serene place to practice. The staff/owners are great and Shosh took great care in answering all my questions before my first time in the studio. I do wish there were a few more classes offered just time-wise but I love the classes they have and it really is a nice, warm place and it does feel like family.

The guys here are very knowledgeable and helpful. I've never experienced attitude or rudeness and have been in the store waiting for some minor service and seen many people come and go and all were treated quickly and with a friendly attitude. I bought my tri bike from this shop and my mountain bikes from another DNA cycle shop.   They don't try to upsell you and fits they do on the new bikes are awesome. I had a couple of items I ordered and they were there in just a couple of days.   This is a great shop.

This was our first time here and we really enjoyed it! There were many things on the menu that we had never tried before and we liked that. We basically asked the staff what they recommended and ordered that. I asked for mine "hot" and it was at the most medium in spice. I have found that people don't usually take me seriously the first time I dine somewhere and request "hot". That was a bummer for sure. But the flavors were great. We had the mini idlies and loved the different chutneys for dipping. We also enjoyed the vegetable pakoda which was done very well here. Probably the best I've had. For an entrees, we had the masala dosa which was really good! Very different, to me, as I've not had it before. I had the chole batura which was excellent. The portions are huge and easily made for leftovers and for enough to shared. I will definitely come back to try some different things. The menu is very extensive and prices were really good.

Ok, call me crazy, but this is my first self-serve frozen yogurt experience. I thought this place was pretty good! I had the cake batter and the red velvet cake which were both really good. I think I liked the cake batter the best but I would probably eat the red velvet again and I need to try the thin mint one! They had a ton of different toppings and I thought they had a nice variety from which to choose including fruit, brownie bites, nuts, etc. They don't get 5 stars because: Staff is pretty rude. Neither of the young women working there made eye contact with any of us and just continued their conversation about someone getting dumped by someone else without saying more than just our total to us all without looking at us. And their raspberries, which were frozen, were a little sad and squishy. Other than that, I will be back here to try some more combinations.

First off, I will say I have not experienced ANY rude staff at all and everyone is always smiling and friendly. After only being members for a week and coming in daily, most of the front desk staff knew my face if not my name. Also, I always order a smoothie on Saturdays after my workout and no one has ever acted put-out even though I can be obnoxious about ordering a special this-and-that smoothie with adders. We were not pressured to become members after an initial conversation about membership options.   I love the class options! They have many different classes offered regularly and some special ones offered at a discounted price to members. I also like the Sunday Family Free day since I can bring a friend in who is a member elsewhere and we can work out together and I don't have to use the guest passes. Locker rooms are very nice and always clean. The machines are great and have always been in great working order when I've been there (5-6 days a week). Cardio machines are very nice and there are plenty; even at the busiest times I have always been able to snag a treadmill or elliptical.   Overall, we have been very happy here and are pleased we left our other gym which just didn't have the same appeal. As for people in the lobby, I've seen them there weekend mornings and no one has walked up and asked me to buy anything. I have never seen them there at 6 AM or in the evenings and the ones that are there are pretty low-key. Last weekend, some women were looking at some purses and the salesperson was quietly standing to one side letting them look to their hearts' content with no sales pitch involved. The yoga studio is a little strange with the curtains but since I have a seperate yoga studio, this is no big deal.

We came here for our anniversary a couple of weeks ago. The restaurant is very quaint and is tucked away from the obnoxious Old Town scene which is nice.  The food was absolutely wonderful. And the wine list was very good. Our waiter knew the menu and the wines very well. He did try to upsell us but since it was our anniversary, we were okay with that. We enjoyed the foie gras which is wonderful with the pickled grapes. The escargot were well-cooked and not swimming in garlic which many other places do to cover up the less-than-fresh, over-cooked concoction they're serving you.  I enjoyed the duck breast sous-vide as my entree and it was excellent. The meat was so juicy and tender but somehow, the skin still had crisp. I asked if it was seared and then put in the sous-vide and then seared again. I'm pretty sure that's how they do it. My husband had the steak frites. The steak was cooked exactly as he asked. The frites were ok, not as good as Zinc Bistro but still very good.  We ended with the souffle which again was simply wonderful. We enjoyed a bottle of cab franc with our meal.   Why it's not 5 stars? Our server, while very knowledgeable, once he'd gotten all his upselling done and realized we were done ordering, pretty much turned cool toward us. My husband also told them when he made the reservation that it was our anniversary and at other restaurants, we've had a glass of champagne or even a special dessert (Acacia formerly of the Four Seasons comes to mind) and asked that we get a special table. Our table was just an average table (though, the place is very small) and no one knew it was our anniversary. I mentioned it to our server and he just half-heartedly said "Oh, happy anniversary, would you like to order the souffle now so I can put it in at the right time?"  I will come back here because the food is wonderful and I want to sit out on their lovely patio.

I am a member of another gym which I frequent for most of my work-outs but I needed a pool, too so I got a membership here, as well. The pool is good, it's kept at a cooler temperature, which is nice (gets your more ready for open water swims in events) and it's not crowded. Overall, the gym layout is odd and wending your way through the mess of cardio machines to get to the locker rooms is a little bit tough. The locker rooms are eh. They aren't very nice and are very basic, but that's fine since I don't spend much time in there anyway. Their class schedule, which I have reviewed but don't intend to use is very sparse! My other gym has over a dozen classes a day but this place has a dozen in a week. However, for convenience of a morning swim on my way to work, it is fine. Though it's not top notch by any stretch and I have had to avoid a cleaning crew vacuuming around my treadmill which was a little annoying for what it is, it's fine. And the prices are decent.

Really nice place! We came here last night in a group of 7 and it was a great experience. The service was quick and friendly and the restaurant is good-sized with the right amount of tables so you don't feel cramped.  The menu is very diverse and I love the "make your own salad" or "burger" selection that each had a ton of different options. Their portions are very large and can easily be shared or taken home for a lunch or another dinner.  I made my own salad with solid albacore tuna with their fresh veggies and the balsamic dressing on the side. Everyone's order was correct and prompt and prices were great. For 7 people who had dinner, some had appetizers and everyone had tea or soda, it was just under $100. We are making this our standard place for our monthly meetings now.

We dropped in on a whim last night. We had not been here before but we were doing the Art Walk and saw the understated outside and it intrigued us. We were very pleasantly surprised since I usually detest "Old Town" and the people who tend to frequent it. (Yes, gentleman, I see your button-down shirt and knock-off prada shoes and your 7s. Yes, ladies, I am still waiting for you to finish getting dressed. Oh? You're done? I didn't realize it was legal to whore around in "clothes" like that.)  Mabel's was very relaxed, even with the live DJ spinning for a charity event. We wanted to enjoy some late night snacks so we were seated at one of the very comfortable booths near the dance floor. The decor is very mystique: dark, without feeling creepy, old-fashioned, without feeling old, and eclectic, without feeling like grandma's basement. The goats really didn't bother me but then I remember the Owl Bar in San Francisco with great fondness (it was noted for being filled to the brim with owls).  The food was surprisingly good for a bar! The Swedish meatballs reminded me very much of how my grandmother makes them and the gravy made a nice sauce to dip the fries in that came with their burger (which I totally didn't do!! that would be so horribly unhealthy!! so horribly, deliciously unhealthy). The burger was great and cooked exactly the way we ordered it. It was juicy and the deviled egg filling on the burger? So different and very delicious. The bun was excellent because it wasn't a bun: it was really more like a cross between a crumpet and an English muffin which let the burger stand out. We split the food and we weren't hungry when we left.  The drinks were excellent. I had one of their champagne cocktails and my husband enjoyed the Manhattan. Service was great, friendly and knowledgable. The scene was overall very hip while being very relaxed. We will be back.   P.S. The reason it's not 5 stars is because the ladies' restroom stalls didn't lock. A little awkward to try and hold the door closed while you...well, you know.....

Bathroom doors are fixed! Paroshka (I probably just butchered her poor name) has now been our server twice and she is excellent! We had bottle service on Saturday for a birthday party and she was great, attentive and made sure no one was ever thirsty. I love this place.

5 stars for saving my day! I had a wedding to attend last night and needed to be on the road by 4:30. I had an appointment at another salon for 2:15 for just an up-do with the plan that I would be home by 3:30 and on to getting ready. At 2:10, the appointment was canceled. I was panicked!! I can not do my own hair, at all. I can barely brush it, seriously. So I had to find someone that could help me. I drove past El Bella and spun a u-turn and stopped in. I was in dirty, bum-around clothes, I had no appointment and I needed an up-do fast. They told me they could do it and at 2:30 I sat down and was out in 45 minutes, so still on schedule!  David did a wonderful job on my hair. I told him what I wanted, all up with some curl and he suggested we actually curl half right up on top and then leave half down with curl. He was right! It looked great, it held all night long even through dancing and the price was perfect ($35 for a walk-in emergency up-do?!). I got tons of compliments from people and I felt lovely.   The building is nice and clean, very open and bright and is a good-sized place. I will definitely come back for other services and more hair services!

This place was ok. I was hoping to be wowed since people really seem to like it. It was a little pricey for what it is. We ordered the chips with the salsa flight. We paid the $6 for the refillable chips (which I think just is silly, seriously, if every other place in AZ can give me free chips, you should, too. Charge me for the salsa flight, sure, but chips and your average pico de gallo really can't be breaking the bank for you.) We wound up not even getting a chip refill so that was a waste (we just couldn't eat that many chips). The pico was average, the other two were pretty decent. Husband ordered the carne asada tacos. They were pretty good. The tortillas had a nice bit of char on them which was good and nice big slices of avocado which was nice. I ordered the grilled steak salad. Pass. There were three tomatoes in it, literally one chunk of avocado and it really was a tiny salad for what I paid. The steak on top was pretty good but all the other elements were so scant it really wasn't worth it. The Sonoran margarita was pretty good. The house ones were just average. Overall, I wouldn't come back most likely for full price but may come back for happy hour.

Very, very good. Service both at the bar and table was impeccable. Our server knew the menu very well and made excellent suggestions. Their unique cocktails were excellent and a decent price for a decent pour. We enjoyed the noshing board to start and then had the cheesy grits with sausage at our server's suggestion and we loved it. We also had a side of roasted shishito peppers which was a special on the menu that night and it was also excellent. We ended with the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores which were so unique but actually quite delicious.   I will definitely be coming back here to try more things from the menu.

This is our only grocery store. The prices are really good and for produce, much cheaper than other stores and such better quality! The meat section is also excellent and offers great cuts of lamb, chicken, pork, beef, turkey every day. I looked everywhere for ground chicken before finding it at Sprouts. The butchers will make any cuts you need. I even bring them whole chickens out of the case and ask them to quarter them or cube a leg of lamb, no problem. The fish is good and their weekly specials allow for some killer deals on things like Sockeye and Chinook salmon. I love the bulk section, too and get all our grains there. All the staff is wonderful and we are such regulars there that everyone knows us and always gives us a smile.   Sandwiches at the deli are an amazing deal and do not scrimp on the ingredients so you can easily split a sandwich into two meals or split it with someone. They also will order things for you (Isreali cous-cous for me though I have seen them carrying it now regularly). Overall, this is the only grocery I frequent now and we've been coming here since they opened.

A truly seasonal menu, I love it! The menu is so fresh and really utilizes what's in season at the time. The staff is very knowledgable, service is fast and very friendly. Their patio is a lovely place for a light dinner or a later snack and drink.  I think the prices are awesome and the portions are ample. Order the crunchy green potato side dish, seriously. It is amazing! I had to force myself to only eat half to save some for my husband. And smoked trout beignets? So good. Especially served with cornichons.  Enjoy a glass of wine or champagne and dine on some truly fresh, unique dishes. I will be back.

We came here with another friend on Sunday at 7:30 with no reservation and had no problem getting a table. The food here is solid, the drink menu is pretty decent, the ambiance is nice, menu is good, service is eh.  We, like others, sat around a while waiting for a drink order to be taken. We ordered the flat bread with hummus and tzatziki. The hummus was excellent and the little pickled veg that came with it was excellent.   I had the original chopped salad after that and it was really, really good. I loved the combination of the flavors and textures. The waitress mixed it up for me and I had only a drizzle of the dressing since I didn't want everything swimming in it. A drizzle was plenty! I had mine with the smoked salmon, our friend had hers with the chicken. I would come back for this salad alone (and those pickle things).   Husband had the pork belly pastrami which was just a little bit too salty but the flavors were great, the rye spaetzle was very unique and the brussel sprout saurkraut was very good.  Overall, I would come here again even if the service isn't fantastic because the ambiance is nice enough that waiting around and enjoying good company is fine.
