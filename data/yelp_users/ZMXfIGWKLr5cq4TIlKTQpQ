The best enchilada style burros in town.  And if you like New Mexican style food, possibly the best anywhere.  I go there about twice a year, yet think about it twice a week.  It's like a drug for me.  I have to ration myself fearing I'd become an addict.    I only go before 11:45 or after 1:30 for obvious reasons.  (Keep that between us please). There is limited outdoor seating and to-go isn't an option for me.  I couldn't possibly resist smelling the food while I drive back.    Tips: Bring cash Be weary of wearing a white shirt Expect to share your air space with a few flies.   The tables are mesh, so scratch anything white. Ritos 101 - Green or red chili burro, enchilada sytle...GET REAL!!!

I had a pair of DSO brand sunglasses that had been in my glove box for a long time. I misplaced the screw to one of the earpieces and couldn't find one that fit. I tried a couple different eyeglass repair kits to no avail.   I was driving down 32nd street and saw their sign and decided to pop in to see if they could help. They assisted me right away and made me feel like I had purchased the glasses at their store. I had never bought anything from them before, so I was a little apprehensive to ask them to help, given they had other customers there who were purchasing. I'm glad I stopped. After about 15 minutes of them trying different screws, they found one that worked. Apparently, the screw for the DSO glasses are a very unique size.   Meanwhile, there was an older lady in there who was not very happy. She was upset, but for no good reason. She had purchased a set of transitions and didn't realize they wouldn't work in her car. The staff at Avante explains that to all their customers, as I heard it a few times while waiting. Apparently the car windows/tint block the UV, which prevents the transitions from activating. Regardless, this old lady was fired up.   I watched as they handled her and the issue with grace and poise. I was impressed at the you guy that took the customer out in the sun and showed her how they work. All the while, Avante was 100% right and the customer was 100% wrong, but they handled it with the right touch. The customer did end up apologizing as I think she was totally embarrassed, since we all got to see her unwarranted tirade.   I also learned some things about UV light and transition lenses! Their customer service was phenomenal. Go check them out.

I use couriers on a regular basis. There are many services in the valley and I've had luck with several. Hot Shot is one of the best. They have been my primary courier service for the last two years and I'm very pleased.  One thing I like about Hot Shots is that they have small pickup trucks and large box trucks for larger items. Think about that next time you have something to pickup or drop off 40 min on the other side of the valley. Even moreso for those of you that need to borrow or rent a truck & drive across town. Call Hot Shots next time and forgettaboutit.  ProTip - If you get your act together before noon or 1pm, you can opt for the 4 hour service and save some coin. They offer 2hr, 4hr, and maybe 1hr too.

I was a long time customer of Ski Pro and having made purchases at all locations several times. I thought of myself as having some brand loyalty...at least when it comes to local retail purchasing.  I do look online if it doesn't require holding or fitting.   However, the last purchase I will ever make from Ski Pro was last summer.  I bought a Ronix ski rope handle.  This was one of their nicest and most expensive models, priced over $120. At checkout I was told about their 2 week return policy.    The following weekend we went to the lake.  After 2 or 3 runs, I noticed it was already coming apart.  Not just in one location either.  The rubber grip was tattered already in two different places, the seams were falling apart, and the clear coating was flaking.    It never touched anything other than water.  Not the board, swim deck, boat, or anything. Literally, about 3 hours of use by two very experienced riders.    The next weekend, 11 days after the purchase, I returned to the store to exchange the rope for a different one and was basically told to "F off".    The 17 year-old stoner behind the counter said they couldn't return the item.  I wasn't even looking for my money back, I just wanted an in-store credit to buy a different handle.  The answer was still no.    His position was that they can't take back the product because it had been used.  Yet he couldn't explain why they allow returns on all other ski accessories which I've purchased mass amounts of over the last 7 year.  I've even returned a wake board I bought from Ski Pro after taking to Lake Powell for a week!  Back then (2002ish) Susan, the owner, ran the Camelback location and had a better grip on things.   So anyhow, I asked the clerk how I would've know the product was faulty unless we used it.  He shrugged his shoulders and said "sorry dude, you own it now".     Apparently, the two week policy is only for unused items.  I asked how they assess if something's been used (given that I've returned numerous items and admitted they were used) i.e. boots that were pinching, shades don't fit right, board not aggressive enough, etc.   He stated "it's a case by case basis".  I couldn't believe the product warranty and company return policy was being judged by a 17yr old kid and basing his decision on if an item looks used. He even said to me "if it looks used, how would we be able to sell it to anyone else?"  I asked him why they would sell a faulty product to someone else.  He shrugged.     After about 4 minutes of him not being able to explain this ridiculous policy, I decided to leave the product with them in hopes they would reconsider their position and reminded him I would be happy to apply the amount to another handle. No dice.  That is the last time I'll ever shop there.  Period.

It couldn't have been an easier deal for me. I was in need of some new plates for an existing trophy. I realize it's not a big ticket item, but you couldn't tell by the way I was treated.   So I emailed an EPS file to them ahead of time. When I arrived, they had my email printed out, understood what I wanted, and assured me that it "was all good"  Not only were the two ladies in there friendly as you would ever want, but they have a nice selection in the showroom that gave me ideas for future needs.   I needed this trophy done in 2 business days and her response was, "oh geez, that's no problem". For some reason I thought that would be a quick turn for a trophy business. Apparently not them! They must have a majority of customers needing stuff within hours or something, because they were pleased to do my job in 48 hrs.   And I am pleased to give them my business.

Our office has a standard glass door with black aluminum framing.  Our standard thumb screw was a little loose and not turning properly. The manufacturer/service tag sticker on the door said Vortex and had a phone number for service.  So I called and asked if someone could come take a look at our loose thumbscrew.    A guy showed up on Monday, spent about 30-40 minutes here.  Apparently the casing or latch assembly was loose .  All he did was take off the thumb screw, lube up the area, and put the thing back on.  Done deal.  No parts, no major issues.    While he was here working, I asked the service tech what the cost would be.  He said "I have no idea, the office would be in touch regarding the bill".   He had me sign a service order or work order.  I looked at that paperwork to see about cost, but it said nothing.  No mention about a minimum service charge,or hourly rate.    3 days later a bill comes from Vortex for $240.00!  It had a list of work done, but nothing itemized, just a total.  Here's some verbiage taken from the invoice regarding the details of work done.  This is no joke...  - "Technician arrived and found thumbturn not operational"  (Nice find!) - "Removed cover plate" (about 10 seconds...I watched) - "Found thumbturn loose"  (no shit?  How did they figure that out?) - "Re-aligned lock assembly" (no new parts, just realignment) - "Lubricated points of friction" ($10 lube charge...seriously for 2 drops) - "Standard quality and safety check"  (ring up another 15 minutes!  We don't want any savage killer doors over here)  None of that was itemized, just a total of $240.00!    Okay, so here's the good part.  I called to see how this could possibly add up to $240.  I was informed the labor rate is $108/hr.  That's outrageous for a guy turning a thumb screw, but okay, whatever.  He was here about 35-40 minutes, which is clearly shown on the service sheet I signed.  The A/R lady from Vortex said they only bill in 30 min increments and round up to the next increment.  So I'm being billed for a full hour.    Okay, where'd the other $130 come from?  They include drive time to and from their shop.  I asked what that rate was.  You guessed it.   $108/hr.  So I looked them up on Google while she was on the phone with me.  Their office is on Kyrene in Tempe.  Our office is on Priest in Tempe!  I asked how that could take an hour of driving time being we're extremely close.  Her response was that it doesn't matter that we're so close, it's a minimum of $108 trip charge even if you're across the street!!!!    He wasn't driving a Ferrari or gold plated chariot.  In fact, had I known I was being billed $108 for an hour driving, I would have made him pick up my dry cleaning and some tamales too!  The good news is that they showed up on the right day and the tech was very nice.  Their doors are nice too.  I gave them two stars because the only problem I had is the shifty way they bill and how ridiculously expensive they are.  No one provided me any information on cost until they mailed a bill.  I'm sure they do great work, just be prepared to pay outrageously for it.    It should have been obvious by how they train their service guys to say "I have no idea what our hourly rate is".  Get real!  First day Johnny?  Lesson:  I should have known if you ask for a lube job from a person you don't know, they'll probably over charge, then screw you!    :-)

I've been going to Acclaim for about 7 years now for my auto work. I own an American made V8 truck and a foreign 4-door passenger car.  I won't take my cars anywhere else. Acclaim is locally owned and operated by Rich and Ken, two natives that run an honest business.  Trust me, I know how hard it is to find an honest reliable mechanic.  These are your guys.  They've been going strong since Cher and Sunny were still together, which is a testimate of reliability and trustworthy service.    They specialize in repairs, motor work, maintenance, and trannys (not the RuPaul type).  Although they don't do body work, they have provided great referrals and pointed in the right direction every single time.  I've had them rebuild by 2wd, 4wd, and overdrive transmission, belts, radiator, electrical system, AC, timing belts...you name it.  Every time I feel assured it will be done correctly and saves me the time of getting three estimates.    If you're lucky when there, you might see one of their whips that they are restoring.  It makes me jealous, but it definitely showcases their expertise and high level of craftsmanship and experience.    One more nugget of greatness...Ken, one of the owners is even a maverick at finding any noise, squeak, rattle, or hum.  If you've ever had one, you know how annoying they can be.  You may have to leave your ride with Ken for a day or two, but he'll find it!    Go see Ken or Rich at Acclaim.  You'll thank me later.

I love this place for these reasons:  * Best west-facing patio in old town. It's upstairs on rooftop and during the winter months, it's a phenomenal spot to lizard-out while eating & drinking. * The food is good. Love to share the lavoshes, and Franco makes one hell of a bloody mary * They have the best potato-skins in the cosmos! Seriously. I know you're thinking "who gives a rip about potato skins?". Just try them and tell me I'm wrong. Won't happen.  * The upstairs patio & bar is a great place to just hang out whether you're eating, drinking or both. They have nice TVs for the games and a kick-ass old juke box. They also recently enclosed the bar area with glass, so it's more comfy during the warmer months.  * Downstairs, in back of the restaurant, there's a cutty bar that's nice and dark...and cool. They have karaoke all the time and apparently it does down in there. I don't karaoke, but occasionally when I hit the head, I'll do a hot lap back there to check out the folks' pipes. Decent.  *The location is incredible. Walking distance to anything you'd want in old town.    The only drawbacks to this place are:  * That west facing roof-top patio can be brutal in the summer. We'll see how much the enclosed glass helps. I've been recently to the upstairs bar after the sun is down, and that was reasonably cool.  * During the winter, you will see loads of tourists, fanny packs, white socks & Burkenstocks, freshly-purchased turquoise jewelry, picture taking with what appears to be safari outfits, etc. Small price to pay I suppose.   Weekend brunches in the winter is where you might find me there.  Cheers!

It's close to my office, so it's very convenient for me to pop in for a bite. I usually eat my lunch quickly while reading the news and they always are quick with taking order, bringing food and check. I can sit down and have a nice lunch in under 15 minutes. Bravo!  Ooh, and they also do breakfast, which is super handy for those really early mornings. And, for those of us who like to eat breakfast for lunch. Yes please!  Note: they only serve breakfast til 11am, but that's close enough to lunch, right?  The theme of the place is nostalgic and vintage CocaCola gear. It's definitely got the cafe feel, home cooking thing and the decor to make you feel like your at your great Aunt Edna's kitchen.   They also do quite a bit of catering. That side of the business is adjacent to the restaurant. I've never had their catering, but only imagine it's top notch.   Their service is great. For a reasonably small location, they always have at least 2-3 people on the floor helping. Even when they're busy, they take care of business. Albeit, on girl mans the phones most of the time - presumably for catering calls.   The food is good. It's straight-forward and made like you would in your kitchen at home. They have a blue plate special everyday and I look forward to checking out that white board.   If you're in the area of University and Priest in Tempe, pop in and check em out. You won't break the bank, you'll be comfortably full and your stomach will thank you later.

I love this place so much.  What the hell is going on.  Sign did change for a hot minute this year.  But now the sign is back to Asi Es La Vida and the doors are chained and the phone number doesn't work.  WTF???  my favorite restaurant.  Please someone tell me they're remodeling and not closed.    WHAT'S THE SCOOP!?!?!?!?

They re-opened!  I'm a very happy foodie right now.  Went for lunch today and it was as good as I've come to expect.  I got the special, which was sea bass.  Unbelievable.    I usually get the specials and have never been disappointed.  Don't forget the guac & chips to start off.  They aren't complimentary, but well worth the price.    All of their natural juice beverages are the best I've ever had.  My favorite is the watermelon.  Yes, I order watermelon juice at lunch!  Crazy no?  The mariachi that's normally playing lunch wasn't there today, but I'm okay with that.  Just happy they're open again.    The service is amazing.  Very personal, prompt, and inviting.    Consider this rating a 7-star!

You can read all the reviews you want on the beer selection below.  I would like to discuss the (MAC + CHEESE)2.  Holy cow, this is world-class if you like mac&cheese.    In fact, it's so much better than anything else, it could be argued that its unfair to compare to regular mac & cheese.  It should have it's own category called "Awesomeness".    It's non traditional mac noodles, which is a nice touch.  Once you read the description you should just close the menu and order up!  A la: chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan with campanelle pasta and white truffle oil.  No joke, it's the real deal Holyfield.  You can definitely taste the truffle oil, but it's not overbearing.  It really adds an amazing flavor.  I guarantee you a happy foodie.  It's a rather large portion, so feel free to get a doggy bag.  It's not a bad idea to do a half portion, I'm sure it's not on the FDA's most healthy food list  ;-)  Splurge on this dish.  Trust me!!

We just moved offices and landed near the Tempe Cornish Pasty Co.  It's certainly an office favorite.  There is very limited seating so we usually go before 11:45 or after 1pm if it's a lunch rendezvous.  The food is amazing and unless you're from the UP, chances are you haven't had anything like it.  There are a ton of different pasty options.  Every time I look over the menu, it's like Christmas all over again.    Service can be a tad slow, but I realize that perfection isn't pre-made.  The beer selection is outstanding as well.  The staff is solid, very polite, and usually showcase a nice selection of body ink.  Don't be scared to try some apps or lighter fare.  EVERYTHING there is great.  Also, they offer half cooked Pastys.  So you can swoop in grab them and finish cooking at your leisure.  Although I usually like posting up a the bar and taking in the great crowd and atmosphere.    It's a weekly stop for me and I don't see that slowing anytime soon.  I also frequent the location in Mesa (corner of Dobson and Guad).  It's a much larger location with a slighty more upscale feel.  Same great food and service.

I hired them to install a tow package on my truck. Shawn the owner, came to do the work himself, which I thought was nice. I'm a small business owner too, and understand the value in an owner-operator actually doing the work.   However, he decided to steal the wiring to my license plate holder during his install. How do I know this? Well, I got pulled over by the police because my license plate light was out. I replaced the bulb and it still didn't work. So I crawled under there and took a look for myself. There is no wire or power to my license plate light and it was obvious what he did.   The idea of a mobile hitch service is great. He was nice and installed it rather quickly (wonder why). I loathe companies or persons that cut corners. It always ends up biting ya in the ass later.   Now, I have to go handle wiring it all back, which sucks royally.  So, if you're looking for a hitch install - At Your Door Mobile Hitches will be there, and do it quick, but be very careful.

Here's how a 1-star shopping plaza gets 4 stars.  So it's New Years day last month and we were just finishing up our brunch, bloodies, and a session of watching bowl games at the Grapevine.  A small army of us decided on an impromptu day drinking pub crawl in old town.  It was 70 degrees and a perfect day to stroll.  The only problem was my lady friend (from out of town) left her tennies in the room.  She only had pumps and her dogs were already barkin from the long night preceding.    So off to Salties they went.  She and I left on a mission to locate some sandals.  I thought snatching up a pair of flip flops would be a no-brainer at Sidewalk Surfer.  Little did I remember that is was New Years Day.  Everyone was closed, even Triangles.  After 2 laps around old town, it looked like it was going to be either the pumps, cowboy boots from one of those awful turquoise stores, or she would have to man up and rock the grocery store feet.   None of those options sat well with her (I could've handled the pumps, but I absolutely despise dirty feet).  I made one last ditch effort and drove down to Southbridge area.  I only saw one door open at a place called the Garage Boutique.  On a hunch we stuck our necks in and said hello.  Katie, the owner, informed us that she was closed, just doing some admin work or inventory, but offered us to peek around.   Took us about 15 seconds to figure out it was another swing and miss!  It was a children's boutique.  She saw the dismay on our faces and had to ask "what are you looking for".  I gave her the 5-sec version with hopes she could point us in the right direction.  To our surprise, she leaned down, grabbed her own pair of sandals and gave them to Lindsey (aforementioned lady friend).  No joke, they were even the right size.  She said to bring them back when we can.  SCORRRE!!  I couldn't believe it.  Such a solid find.  I offered her money and she wouldn't take it.  I even offered to bring her some bagels or a bento box from Kyoto (I think that creeped her out a bit haha).  I was 2-3 drinks deep and we were fired up at this point.  So we went about our day...yada yada yada.  Needless to say we had a great day thanks to a genuine person helping us out.  The moral of this long rant is that Katie is the shit!  Her boutique is full of cute kids stuff: clothes, all sorts of fresh gear, mother-loving accessories, trinkets, and the like.  Not only does this boutique have some great pint-size threads, but its owner is a enormous sweet heart, life saver, and obviously has great taste.  If you have children, make sure to drop in.  You won't be dissappointed with the service!        p.s. I only mention the 1-star because most of the tenants & shops are gone.  If you see any shops in the Mix are open, they are definitely worth a looksie.    Thanks again Katie!

BONE IN!   Hands down, the best steak around.   Get an order of sauteed mushrooms to go with it, you won't be sorry.   The bar high tops are a great place to eat if you're not looking for the sit down experience.  The dining area is very nice, but I have a hard time being sat back there when I'm with my buddy looking for a stellar piece of meat and a stiff cocktail.  The service is great and Thurs - Sat evenings will host a good crowd in the bar.  The live music is a great touch too.    Two words...Bone In.  Make it happen.  Period.

DONT DO BUSINESS WITH RIVERVIEW.   It used to be called Larry Miller Riverview Toyota. Now it's Brent Berge's Riverview Toyota. Without knowing exactly why they changed names, I can imagine it had to do with bad brand recognition.   Now I realize why this company only has a two star rating. They are shady crooks. I called to ask them to email me my service record from the last time I had them work on my car. They refuse to send it to me.   I initially tried speaking with the service manager, Cory Oliver who pawned me off on his assistant manager, Rich Philipin who is undoubtedly of the people that give car sales people such a bad name.   Not only would they not email me the date and time that I dropped and picked up my car, but Rich wouldn't even tell my why. I asked him three times and he explicitly said "No I won't email you". I then asked why and he wouldn't email and he didn't answer. I repeated "So you won't email me, nor will you tell me why you won't email me". He responded with "Yes, that is the case".   Ironically, Jason Valdez was the service person that helped me on the front end and had no problem emailing me to schedule the appt. Also, their service dept (Molly) emailed me after the service wanting my feedback. So, it's not like they can't email. They just won't. So weird.  It's obvious they feel they screwed up royally and are so slimy they won't provide me the simple data of when I dropped and picked up my car.   They might try to respond to this post saying they tried. So let me smack that down right now. When I initially asked what time I dropped my car off, Rich said "we don't have that information".  Riiiight! Like I believe you don't keep service records. Red flag after red flag. Everyone knows they keep records of when customer work orders are created, not to mention the schedule in the service dept.   I knew that was bullsh*t since they provided me a loaner car, which was checked out electronically and checked back in. I know this because I watched the lady with the hand held device check out the loaner, and check it back in.   When I brought that up, he started squirming. Then made up some bullsh*t and straight up lied to me. I told him that was not accurate. He replied "well, that's the information I'm giving you" as if he knew I knew he was lying. SNAKE.  Funny thing is that I really need the records for a personal matter. Yet, they are so used to screwing people over, they are scared to release just when I dropped and picked up my car.   I will NEVER give them another dollar and I hope anyone reading this doesn't either.

I changed accountants about two years ago, and I now realize I should have done it sooner. I've used a few different firms and accountants for my business in the past, but none have come close to providing the level of attention and organization that Thom and his staff does.   Sandy T was the team member that did a lot of the heavy lifting on our corporate taxes, rec's and general cleanup. She is amazing to work with. I cannot express how much of a pleasure it is to work with Sandy and Thom.   I know full well how arduous some of the items were that I needed done. At every turn, they were professional, poised and just powered through the pile of work.   Thom and his team are very approachable, knowledgeable and accountable (pun intended). It's very important to me that people do what they say, and I am proud to have them handling my taxes, both corporate and personal.  Do yourself a favor and give Thom a call.

We work about 1/4 mile from this great little spot.  It used to be called the Brown Bag Sandwich shop and I ate there a few times a year.  Since they've been Arizona Sandwich Company, I've eaten there on average once a week, and for good reason.    All the sandwiches I've had are awesome.  The bread is so soft, it feels like a goose down pillow.  They hook you up with a healthy portion no matter what item you order.  The sides are delicious and the desserts look amazing too.  (I don't normally do desserts)  We are greeted by name now when we arrive which feels great.  The daily specials are a no-brainer.  Lately I don't even peruse the menu.  I just go with the daily special and have yet to be disappointed.    Here's a tip: follow them on FB and you can get a $2 sando if you're hot on the status updates.    I recommend checking this place out.  It's directly east, across the strees (52nd) from the QT on the corner of University/52nd.    The best part, is that I can get in/out in less than 15 minutes.  That really helps for people with very busy schedules.    See you there!

I sourced a few new cleaning companies. We were having issues with the cleaning crew at our office. It seems they got complacent with the details and being thorough.   It was important for it to be a local company, not a national chain. Been there, done that. I came across Arizona cleanPROS after doing some research online (websites, Yelp, Angie's LIst, etc). After contacting them, a time was scheduled to view our space and provide an estimate. They genuinely care enough to ask the right questions - to make sure they are addressing our pain points - and to ensure nothing is compromised.   After meeting with a handful of crews, it was an easy decision. We had the Arizona cleanPROS team in the very next week to clean out 3500 sq ft office. Their attention to detail was apparent immediately. We did have a small snafu with the alarm the first session, but I can understand that. All alarm pads are a little different, plus the manager took immediate action and came by to ensure it didn't happen again. That was impressive.    I've been so happy with them, I've now hired them for my house as well. The rates are very reasonable. As with many industries, you get what you pay for, and I feel their service is the best value I've experienced.   With my house, I get the same level of attention, even though my place is a fraction of the size of my office. If you're looking for a solid, reliable cleaning company - give them a shot. I trust you'll be as pleased as we have been!  ProTip: Leave a full roll of toilet paper and you might find some neat origami next time you hit the head.

I purchased a 12' enclosed trailer from them back in 2009 or 2010. The trailer has been amazing. I haven't had any issues and it is great quality and the price was very reasonable.   They would call and remind me of my free service and inspections. That was super helpful, because I'd never remember to get the wheel bearings greased and such. Since then, I've had a few issues that were user-error. I broke the rear foot and it needed to be replaced/rewelded. They did it quickly and very inexpensively too.   Also, since I purchased my trailer, I've noticed they've rebranded the company a bit - for the better. They are totally corporate, but seem to have retained the local gear-head friendly tone and style. Not sure if there's new ownership or new leadershiop, but the new brand looks great.   Last year I had to repair the driver side wheel well / fender and lights when a damn filthy retread jumped up and bit me. That 30lb piece of rubber did a number on that fender area.   I took it in to Trailers Plus and they repaired it correctly, without trying to rake me in any way. They gave me all my options and their recommendation as to what they'd do if they were me. A day later and a very stomachable bill and I was back on the road.   I asked about replacing the tire. They gave me a quote, which was a little high (since they aren't a tire co). I asked and they steered me in the right direction to buy the right tire for a better price. Incredible customer service. Did not expect that.   The latest interaction was today. My dome light plastic case rattled off and broke a while back. I never made it a priority since the light still works. But the bulb is exposed and I know it's just a matter of time before I smash it with a tool in hand. So, I called to see if I could buy that piece of replacement plastic cover. Spoke to Christian. He informed me they don't sell that piece of plastic al a carte and that I'd have to buy the entire light fixture.   Since mine is incandescent, he mentioned I could just buy the new LED version which is much better (and I agree!). The cost was only like $15, but he said if I wanted it shipped, I'd have to order on their website.   Instead of letting me head off into the internet-ether to fend for myself, he went to the website in parallel to make sure I found the right part. In about 30 seconds-flat he realized that part wasn't showing on their online store.   Guess what? He zipped over to Amazon.com, found the part in less than 30 seconds. He asked me for my email, and sent me the link.   BOOM! $8.95 shipped Prime. F*cking incredible.   The whole phone call took like 90 seconds. I got a better LED light for under $9 and saved $6 - $7.   Bravo, Christian.  Keep it up Trailers Plus!
