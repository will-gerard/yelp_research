The quality of mani / pedi just wasn't there for me. My pedi looks sloppy and it dried looking matte and with bubbles instead of glossy. The person doing my pedi barely removed excess nail polish that was on my skin. The chairs are extremely comfortable but the service was fair. The men seemed very welcoming but some of the women did not seem very nice. Not sure it's worth the money.

Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.

The linguine and clams here is fireeeee!!!!! The pasta was perfectly cooked and they give you a bunch of clams. As with most places on the strip it's pretty expensive but for made-from-scratch pasta it's so damn good. The ambiance is pretty upscale which is nice if you're dressed to the nines before a show. Definitely check this place out if you're in the mood for Italian.

This location uses WAY too much raw onion. It was so potent and overpowered the entire double-double. It literally made my mom sick to smell and me sick by eating it. They need to get their onion game together.. Not worth the wait-- go to other local locations or ask for no onions

This is literally the best TJ maxx I have been to. Greatest selection, best brands, I went here 3 times in 2 days when I was on vacation. I bought so much stuff. So happy with my purchases. Amazing purse selection

One of my all time favorite restaurants. WOW the filet mignon was probably the best steak I have ever had.. and this isn't even a steakhouse. The meat was cooked absolutely perfectly and cut like butter. Our waiter waited on us hand and foot. He was delightful and upbeat. We had the gnocchi for an appetizer which was pretty good. The drinks were incredible and would make any mixologist proud. Very interesting yet high quality ingredients were used to make delicious  cocktails. For dessert, my mom absolutely loved the pb and pudding, which is saying something because she's extremely picky. Can't wait to return !

The spicy pepper jack brat was ridiculously bland, not spicy whatsoever, not cheesy. I was looking for big bold flavors but the brat fell short. The bread was delicious. Crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. The Bloody Mary that a customer posted on Yelp posted a picture with a sausage as a garnish-- mind did not :( but it was very good.  my moms salad was probably the best part. With a place that has "brat" in the name. I expected way better.

This may be the craziest review I've ever written but this is THE GREATEST GAS STATION IVE EVER BEEN TO. Cleanest nicest, biggest bathrooms. Employees were extremely attentive. Every beverage known to man is sold here including legitimately 30 slushy flavors and alcohol. Every snack and candy is sold here. Gas pumps galore. Everything was amazingly clean and ready to go!!! Favorite gas station ever. Quiktrip I applaud you. :)
