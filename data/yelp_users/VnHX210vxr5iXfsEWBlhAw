Cheese, cheese and more cheese! Oh and wine, fudge and kitschy souvenirs, too. The anticipation of stopping here on the way back to Chicago from Hanock, WI made the three hour ride home more bearable.   The staff was super friendly and willing to let you sample almost anything. I tried some cheese spreads, fudge and fancy cheeses such as Mango Habanero. I regret not picking up more cheese!

The concept of this place is pretty neat, but I didn't have the best experience here. The ordering process is a little confusing and I didn't see any signs that said they were cash only. I had to go to the ATM then stand in the long line again. Once you order, they tell you to wait for your number to come up on the board. The number board is inside the dining room near the ceiling and it's hard to find!   I had the mushroom and sausage pizza. It wasn't bad but could have used more sauce. I had a glass of red wine which was served chilled....  I would give this place three stars but there were little bugs crawling on the table. ewwww!!!!!  We really enjoyed the organ player and would have stayed longer, but there were too many kids. This is a cool place to check out but watch out for creepy crawlies...unless you want them on your pizza.

My girlfriends and I came here because we had passes to get in for free. While were walking to the door, a promoter asked if we wanted to get in for free. We told him we already had passes. He said he would put our names on the list so we wouldn't have to wait in line.  He did and we went right in while people in the super long line yelled at us. Nice!   The music was alright and it seemed like more of a lounge that a club. There isn't anywere to sit down unless you have bottle service. Apparently there isn't anywere to stand either because the bouncers kept yelling at my friend and shooing us away!  You can either dance all night on the tiny dance floor or shell out $$$ for bottle service to sit down.This place sucked and I only give it two stars because we got in for free without waiting.

I want to come back to Vegas just for this place! My girlfriends and I had a late dinner which was excellent. The waiter was super nice and helpful too. Its been two years and I forgot exactly what we ate, but it was some kind of meal that had a little of all their popular dishes.  It turns into a club afterwards so we hung around the bar until then. This way we didn't have to wait in line. They played a lot of house music, which I love. There were women hanging from the ceiling doing acrobatic type stuff. There are also women on the bar who will pour shots into your mouth. The drinks were pricey, but nice and strong.

My friend and I were on vacation and had another place in mind, but we came here after hearing great things about Rio Mirage. The guac was decent and our meals (mahi mahi tacos and spinach/chicken enchiladas) were okay, but kind of bland. We liked our margaritas but they were WEAK! We ordered mediums which were a pretty good size, but not strong at all. If we come back to Surprise, I'd rather go elsewhere. I think this may be a chain...

I'm from the midwest so I was excited to see mountains and cacti! My friend and I were staying in Surprise so it was a very short drive (about 10-15 minutes) for us. I wish we had mountains this close in IL! Admission is $6 and was good for two visits. The first day, we did the Waterfall Trail. It was very scenic and we saw a lot of petroglyphs which was really cool. No waterfall this time though. The second day we did Waddell Trail. It was alright but flatter. Waterfall goes more into the mountains. I wish we had more time to do another hike or two because I loved it!  We did both hikes early in the morning, around 7am and the trails were not  crowded at all.

In-N-Out was everything I dreamed it would be! I like how the menu is very simple and not overwhelming. I had the #2 and devoured the whole meal. Hey, when you're on vacation, calories don't count, right? I loved the burger but the fries were meh. They don't cook them with salt so you have to salt them yourself. I wish Chicago had this chain, but I would probably have a fupa if that were the case.
