Jamie is the BEST for every event. I have used her many times for nights out, makeup lessons and most recently a wedding I was in. My makeup was flawless all night and looked absolutely amazing in pictures. I would recommend Jamie to anyone and everyone. And on top of it all,  she gives tips while she's applying so you can attempt to do it your self.

I hate to write negative reviews, but last night was my second disappointing visit with this location and sadly, will probably be my last. The first evening I was there, we found hair in 2 of the 3 dishes we ordered; This was corrected with a credit and complimentary food after we asked to speak to the manager, but still off putting none the less.   Last night we were a table of two; we ordered 2 pitchers of beer and some single served drinks in addition to 3 appetizers. When we asked for our bill, our server made the comment that he should have charged us for electricity since we took up one of his tables for 4 hours--- if that wasn't rude enough, when he returned with our bill he said "thank you ladies for trying our orange blossom beer and a few appetizers."   The rude attitude is what led to leave this review--- mistakes happen but there is no excuse for bad customer service.
