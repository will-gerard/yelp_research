It is a bad sign when you walk into a place and instantly have an uncontrollable desire to clean something...anything... It would behoove them to maybe wipe a few things down, or brew their tea fresh in the morning, or possibly even bake their goods before opening, instead of the day before.

I've been shopping at this antique mall for years but I've never eaten at Willy's.....because I do not eat hot dogs. Ever. Today I ate a hot dog and unfortunately I will have to come back again, and probably again once more. My only gripe: no brewed iced tea, just the sugary stuff in a can/bottle.

Well I guess you can't accuse Paradise Bakery of contributing to the obesity epidemic in America. I'm not sure the breakfasts could get any smaller, but they will likely try. I really enjoyed the sides of white bread and the foggy iced tea with the look and consistency of thick, creamy apple cider though...

This place is lame. I don't have a more eloquent way to put it. There is no one in this place on a Tuesday night but myself and my kids. They are only allowed on the 'under age 7' side to jump. Ok, I get it. Parents are only allowed to jump with their kids on the 'over age 7' side. Sorry kids, guess you won't be having fun with mom today. Nonsense.
