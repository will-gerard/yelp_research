Okay. First the good, then the outstanding.   The good is that if you arrive a few hours ahead of the event, the seating is fast, the food prompt and tasty, and the decor decently interesting.   Now, my personal experience with server "Alex". I refused to order a "Tom Brady" Burger. I asked for a Mark Sanchez without explanation. He looked at me oddly. I explained that I could not in good conscience endorse anything with Tom Brady's name on it.   I got my burger. Yum. Then my wife and I split a desert. Funnel cake sticks with ice cream. Double yum.   The best thing is that when the check came, Alex had crossed out the receipt entry of "Brady Burger" and replaced it with "Mark".....too funny. It was just a little thing, but boy did it light up our day.   Thanks Alex. Thanks Cooperstown.   Too fun.

Thank you!   To say we were surprised is an understatement. We brought along some family to enjoy it with us. The veal, fuggetabout it. Ravioli... eaten until there was barely a red stain on the white plate.   The service: awesome.   It's a relaxed place where they wait until you've eaten your appetizer until you order your entree. Tr√©s European.   It was spectacular. We became heroes when the deserts came out. And even more awesome when the coffee with the Sambuca arrived.   When you are looking for an authentic, tasty, delightful experiential dinner, go here.    Thanks again, Guys. We had an excellent time.

Definitely an underlooked gem in Gilbert. To qualify, you have to love Hibachi and you can't be turned off by a "strip mall" exterior.   Food was excellent, the "show" was definitely rehearsed, bathrooms were "meh" -- I'd almost take off a star for that but after a Kirin Ichiban and a couple of decent vodka tonics, they get the star back.   They have no deserts, so keep that in mind when bringing the lady or the kiddies.   Overall, this is a place I will go back to and certainly a place I would bring my friends to.

Wow. I saw Cirque De Soleil in Vegas with my wife some year's ago. I under estimated the effect it would have on me.   Tonight, I experienced that same effect, but with a restaurant and not a performance.   Although. Kai is a kind of performance that I was delighted to be a part of. From the ritualized watercolor menu signature presentation sanctioned by a holy man to just some of the most killer-kick ass food on the planet. I understand why this place consistently gets 5 stars.   I understand it to be one of the few true 5 star restaurants in the nation. One pricey visit and you will no doubt understand why.    I found out about a special summer menu (from Mouth By Southwest)  that is  tailored to valley locals for $65 plus a well welcome wine flight for $15 on top that runs from May to late July.    You have to go. I almost want to take stars away from my other reviews because this one is that cool. Located a few miles away from the casino "Wild Horse Pass" at a most amazing Sheraton.   The pudding, the bison, the amuse' bouche, the staff, the scenery, the cucumber caviar, ... ... the finish.   It's a culinary performance that you do not want to miss.

Beau MacMillan is the executive chef here. What a talented chef. We've been there a few times. The first time we were there he had a special lobster bisque like soup with a breaded scallop at the bottom.... It was amazing. My wife swears by the lamb.   It;s really awesome. The chicken is just chicken... but so far everything else has been delicious.

I really enjoy their pizza. I am from NY and crave thin crust with "spicy" tomato sauce. Most of the places in the valley don't appeal to me, but this little strip mall pizza joint is the closest I've found to East Coast pie.

We had a really nice time here. We used the on the floor seating tucked intimately away from the main dining area. It was really, really nice. Quiet, private, and relaxed. We watched an Indian crime drama on the TV hung over the bar while dining on a large wooden table with our feet stretched out beneath.    The food was great. Some of the rice was scorched, but we ordered extra so it was a non-issue. I had vindaloo at "medium" spice, but was actually very mild. I am not complaining. I am sure they could have killed me with spice if I'd asked for it. Most vindaloos that I have had suffer from taste to spice ratio. The less the spice, the flatter the taste. Guru Palace did not have this problem. The flavor was there, but not the spice.   I would recommend this place for dining. I don't know about their buffet. For dinner -- especially as a date--, sitting in the "on-the-floor" seating section, it was special.

The BEST happy hour! Cool drinks like Hi-Yah and Shiso Horny... Appetizer and select sushi half price. Even the Karoake rooms are half price. It gets a little d-baggy at the night when the Ed Hardy with Fedora dudes arrive, but the staff is excellent, the scene is lively. The music is cool.   Best is to spend an afternoon starting at 4. Drink some great cocktails, eat like you've never eaten and walk out with only a slightly lighter wallet.   This is where we take all of our out-of-town friends.

This is a magical place. Really. Easily one of my favorite spots in the valley. Lazy walks, flowing streams, Friday night public observatory visits, fishing, much, much more.   Make the journey. Check this place out for a wonderful walk and lots of tree shade.   Awesome.

Wow- I ordered a Cheeseburger in the two for 10 deal. The patty was obviously direct from the freezer, very low quality. Not even up to the level of Dairy Queen and certainly not In-N-Out caliber. It's was really bad. I ate half of that slimy mess and asked for the check.   My wife had a Chicken sandwich for $9 and change that was roughly the size of a slider.   The service was decent. The atmosphere is good, but it's a restaurant, right? I wasn't looking for gourmet, but I did expect something that was at least edible.   I have eaten at various TGIF's several times and always felt that were decent. Not amazing, but for corporate food, they were all right. I am not sure how TGIF franchises work. Perhaps the one in Chandler makes their own decisions about portions and food quality. I can't speak to that.   I hope that they do improve, but I doubt very much I will ever be back to find out.

So we heard about this place on the Cooking Channel. Specifically the Baked Alaska (which unfortunately we discovered upon arrival was no longer on the menu.) Walter, the manager came over and said that he would see what he could do. The chef said yes and it was AWESOME.   Emma, our server was bright, cheerful, funny and just the right amount of attentiveness. The prices were reasonable. The atmosphere was great. Even the live music was well above par. We highly recommend.

Recently went in to have my A/C checked out. They were extremely thorough and fair. Who could ask for more? The supervisor was very straight forward. I felt like I was not in a chop shop but rather a legitimate business not interested in fleecing me, but forming a solid business relationship. One I will rely on again in the future.

This place is full of goodness. I quite the finicky eater and there at least two dozen things on the menu that I am anxious to try. I've been here a few times and never been disappointed.   Yummy food. Good service. Decent though not great prices. A cool NYC theme atmosphere. Thumbs up to our own Valley original.

Very inconsistent with their delivery policies. We used to order twice a month and tip the driver generously. We often would buy an extra dish to take to work the next day. The food is/was outstanding.   We live 3 & 3/4 miles away. They changed their delivery policy and said that we were out of range. Then, we called a few days later and they said it was okay. Thinking that the first refusal was just a fluke, we had some friends over, enjoyed a bottle of wine and planned to have a great meal from Thai Chili delivered. We called them for our regular delivery and were told that the manager on duty would not allow the driver to deliver to our area. Our neighbors told us that they never had a problem ordering for delivery.  It depends on who's working whether you can get delivery. This sucks. It makes it impossible to plan an evening in. We are done with this place. I get that they need a range of delivery, but the inconsistency has left a sour taste in our mouth.

They need to fix some things. The service is very poor. The website is confusing.   I went there on a Sunday night so I don't know if it ever gets crowded, but it does seem like the non gold class seats are not much in demand.   The gold class seat do recline, but if you are taller than 5' 9", expect your feet to cramp up against the mini walls in front of you. Worse, if you are the unfortunate person sitting in front of a tall person, expect to have the smell of their socks inches above your head. (We moved seats. It was too much.) For this reason alone, I would only go back if I could guarantee the front row of the gold class which does not have a row directly behind it. Instead it has the server staging area.  Still, I gave it 4 stars because it DOES have potential. Let's work on that service, folks. Get a manager in there who emphasizes to his staff that it's supposed to be first class not steerage.

Oh boy. When you walk in, you immediately understand that you are stepping into a parallel universe. 30% of the place is a giant walk-in humidor. 70% is a lounge/neighborhood bar-esq establishment where smoking is not only allowed but encouraged.   The smoke level is probably pretty severe for those that don't smoke. While they ample smoke eaters, it's still a little bit overwhelming. There are men and women (mostly men) slowly enjoying a tasty cigar over a well made drink.   They have dozens of high end liquers and beers. From $30 Infininiums, to $19 Don Julio 1942 "shots", all the way to MacCallan 1969 served alongside affordable ($3.75) well drinks made from decent stock. Thay have an excellent selection of beers in all ranges.   I don't smoke cigars so I have no idea the quality, but judging from the bountiful selection and my friends' reactions, I say that it's a win.   You can smoke indoors or out. Cigarettes are allowed. The staff is helpful and attentive. It's a bit like a sports bar in that they have several flat screens facing the bar.   In a lot of ways, it's a step back in time. Whether stepping back to a "Mad Men" era or speak-easies, it's a worthy trip.

Wow--- never been to a restaurant that dropped stars from me and my wife so rapidly. We so wanted to love this place. The decor is cool. The menu is fresh. They have a cool Monday pizza and movie special. We literally were in a conversation about how awesome the changes from Maria Maria's. And how we could come back with some friends. Seriously, we were planning our next visit.  Then the food came. I don't know if it was any good to be honest.   I was so freaking grossed out by what happened just before.  I asked a server for a spare dish. I saw her pick up one, make a funny look when she looked at it and then she grabbed another. After she placed it down, I went to move it toward me and my thumb squished into maybe 3/4 of an inch of a slimy mass stuck to the underside of the plate. I turned it over and it was a blackish something larger than the diameter of a smashed orange and nasty. I was skeeved out. I went to wash my hands immediately. Yuck.   I stopped to tell the hostess on the way back to the table. She sent the manager over. Our server came over as I was letting the manager know that I was really disturbed by the experience. Our server said "oh, it was just lettuce" as if I was the a-hole for even mentioning it. The manager said the only words I will probably ever hear from him as I will likely not be back--- "So, we good?"   I mentioned to the server after she came back that I did not think it was lettuce... she argued a bit with me. Maybe it was lettuce. Maybe it was some other rotting mass on my dinner plate. I don't know.   It bothered me. It bothered my wife. Trust me, it was pretty gross. We nibbled around the food-- I didn't honestly much interest it. Maybe I am squeamish. Maybe I was being a bit of baby. I don't think so.   Easily the meal should have been comped at worst, my concerns not marginalized. Instead, we paid the full amount for the meal. Tipped and left with food that hopefully will reheat when my appetite has returned.   I've written this review not as vengeance piece, but in the hopes that the staff can maybe adjust up and respond to awkward situations more professionally.   So, we good?

What a great place to have a party! I recently went to a birthday party with a dozen or so people. They have a private room off of the bar that is perfect for this type of event.  You still feel "connected" to the scene, but separate and special. No less than 6 different servers tended to the guests.   There was a little mix up on one of the person's pizza, but the staff corrected once it was brought to their attention and went the extra mile to make good.   This is my newest haunt. I love the service, the staff but especially I love their chipotle red sauce on the custom pizzas. Definitely a great place.

We recently went to Devoured Phoenix and AZ Elite was our transportation.   The Cadillac  was immaculate.    We had the pleasure of have Chris as our driver. He was exceptional. He has the gift of personality. He knew when to be a part of the conversation and when to be apart from it. I would personally request him or a driver based on his recommendation.   There were little touches that impressed my party of five individuals as well. Like being *perfectly* on time with pick up and departure. It was nice. Perfect score.    Also having cold water on departure was pretty awesome, too.

This is a place where it is very hard to stay sober -- especially during happy hour when their delicious extremely well-prepared house margaritas are just $4.50.  An extra-chilled shot (3¬∫ F) of high-end tequila is less than $8. The decor is very cool. I don't love that the location is next to a very busy surface street, but they have a huge fan system which all but blocks out the outside world without becoming a distraction.   The staff very friendly and engaging. The chairs comfortable.   I have been there three times and not been disappointed yet. Well, not entirely true. All three times, I have to stop after just two drinks despite wanting more.

Game changer.  Gilbert has long awaited a place as cool and classy as this. Extremely well crafted cocktails, imaginative desserts, and delicious food. Despite the stress of a brand new restaurant immediately flooded by 100's of customers, Joyride held up extremely well.   Drinks were served in regular fashion. Mike, the bartender, and Chris, also a bartender, served Mazaltan Mules with short delay. What ever wait we had, the taste, texture, and payload of the drink more than made up for it. We also tried the Agua Fresca's.... yum. Fruity with a kick.  I am delighted.   Lauren, the manager of Joyride, was on point without being in the face of her staff. She genuinely cares about her restaurant. I know sometimes new places get a bad rap here on yelp when they begin as they work out the bumps. I urge you to speak with her prior to giving anything less than a 4. She's pretty real.    Thank you, Joyride. Thank you. I will be back... lots.
