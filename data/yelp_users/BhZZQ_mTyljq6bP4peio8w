I've been waiting for two hours to get an oil change. I'm not in line or anything, my truck is in the bay, the mechanics are just messing around. I'd recommend anyplace other than Walmart if your looking for a simple oil change.

Very helpful when I went to buy a faucet valve. Guy there showed me exactly what I needed and checking around, it was a good deal too.

I always bring Arizona newcomers here. You can't beat the atmosphere and the good is good old home cookin! Also the gift shop has a wealth of information about the Superstition Mountains.

It takes 30 minutes or more just to check in to this place. 3 people working the front desk. And this is at 9pm on a Monday. I can't imagine what a busy night looks like. When I got to the room I quickly realized how filthy it was. I've posted several pictures. It was also in disrepair. The toilet paper holder was broken, the tub drain was also broken, and the shower head was in bad need of replacement. The mini bar was missing many item. Hopefully they don't bill me for that, I'll post an update

Owner was nice and waived the notary fee since I was sending something priority overnight, he then found a way to get my package out that day, even though it was past the 5:15 cut-off time.

Extremely slow pharmacy, even when not busy.

Very cool. The best part is the ice cold beer after a long day at the lake. And the most expensive wallpaper I have ever seen.

I agree with most posters- I came here to save time and they tried to upsell everything. I wanted an oil change and it took over an hour.

This company does a great job. They are the only data recovery lab with class 100 cleanroom in the Phoenix area. Friendly staff, fast and accurate results.

This place has really good "World Famous" shakes.   Try the date one -especially unique. Only problem is they are way overpriced. Good price for gas considering its in the middle of the desert.
