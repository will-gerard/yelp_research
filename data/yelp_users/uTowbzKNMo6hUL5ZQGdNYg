I own a property management firm and called Bob concerning one of our properties that had wood flooring that had extremely ground in dirt. Horizon Carpets did an excellent job removing it, the floors look wonderful!  I HIghly recommend Horizon carpets.

As a broker of a property management company we have (unfortunately) had to deal with this horrendous hoa management company. Quick to send violations and quick to demand  money but when something is brought to their attention that needs THEIR attention, it is either ignored or you are given a nasty rude response. Our company deals with dozens of different hoa management companies and we try our very best to keep all our properties in compliance. This company is the worst.

Jayd is fabulous! She takes her time giving me a natural glow that fades naturally and it lasts about 7 days. i drive quite  a distance to see her and will not go anywhere else. I highly recommend Jayd and Bronze Buddha!

I love Dr Roxie Strand and her associates! Meghan always greets me with a warm smile and kind words. Melissa is equally great! And Dr Strand? Cannot say enough about how much I love her! She  is very thorough and has spent a great amount of time with me, inquiring about my health issues/concerns and finding a healthy solution to my chronic "condition". And although I still have a long road ahead of me with my Ulcerative Colitis/Crohns, I am feeling better, my symptoms are not as severe and I believe that with Dr Strands help (and her wonderful staff) that my health will continue to improve. I recommend Dr Strand to everyone that is searching for an alternative, safe and healthy solution for their health.
