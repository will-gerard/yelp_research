good mall to spend the day. it has a lot of stores..forever 21 has 2 floors which is nice. they have a children's play area but it needs to be expanded and upgraded if you ask me. the food court has a lot of choices. there's also an amc movie theater at the ground level with reclining leather seats.

good movie theater! another promising alternative if you are not able to reserve seats for amc arrowhead. the theater is big, clean, and is located in a nice area. the staff are friendly and accommodating too.

my family and i have been going to this place for years and i must say they are still a good place to get some authentic chinese food. some of my faves are the ff: house chicken special, their wonton soup, beef and brocolli, mongolian beef, and their shrimp fried rice! they also have offer a lunch menu that are affordable in price; the meal comes with soup and egg roll, which is not bad for lunch! the staff are friendly and helpful as well.

this is a good breakfast place. i especially love their cajun style benedict. big servings and good food. you might want to arrive early during breakfast hours as the place can get quite busy. servers are friendly. the only thing is that space is quite tight.

surprisingly delightful place for the whole family to enjoy. the museum actually looks small from the outside...but it actually has 2 floors. they areas dedicated to the ff: dinosaurs, egypt, african safari, etmology, etc. their regular admission fee is $10, but you can get discounts for being a student, seniors, etc.

Been going to this hiking place for several years and it remains to be a fave of mine. They recently improved the trail which is good since it's becoming more friendly to hiking beginners. You can either walk the concrete walking path or do the rocky hiking path towards the top of the mountain if you like to challege yourself.

good korean bbq! i have been going to this place for several years now and i must say that they still retain their magic. for the bbq, you can either cook the meat and they do it for you. they also serve sushi rolls, appetizers and variety of soups and noodles. i especially like their E5 beef stew clear noodle soup. if you are looking for entertainment, they also have a bar and  karaoke rooms. their staff are friendly and helpful as well. i definitely recommend this place.

This place used to be a family fave but for over the years...it's wow factor has faded. The food has become average. The staff, however,  still remains to be friendly.

Love this place compared to Davang's and Little Saigon. My personal fave is the grilled chicken and their pork egg roll. Their oxtail soup is very tasty as well. They also have desserts to choose from...love the taro shave ice with wafer stick and banana. The price is affordable as well. Overall, it is a good place to go to if you are craving for some pho.

2 stars for being treated rudely by the server. if for the sushi...i would say it's cheap and they do offer a variety of sushi. they have appetizers and desserts at the revolving table. it can get busy and crowded on weekends so i suggest to get there early.

I usually go to amc arrowhead but this amc is also a good alternative. Love the fact that it's big and has a lot of theaters inside; moreover, it is surrounded by different food establishments. The staff are helpful as well.

my first here to eat. i must say that even though the place is located in an unassuming intersection, not to mention just in the hidden corner...they are actually a good place to eat at.  prices are affordable. we ordered the chicken satay and i must say they are pretty good. their pad thai is good as well...it's now a fave of mine. they give you the option to choose what level of spice to put. if you dont ask for spicy, then they will just serve the pad thai without any tinge of spiceness.  overall, i had a very good experience at this place.

good ice cream place! there is a family night discount every tuesday night which is a nice deal ($1.49 per regular ice cream scoop or $1.29 per kids scoop). there is also the option of buying 2 pint for $9.99 which is a good deal! there's a variety of ice cream flavors, ice cream cakes and also sundaes and smoothies. much affordable prices compared to coldstone. the staff are friendly and attentive as well.

I like this QT branch. Gas price is lower compared to other location and it's near my house. Also, the place itself is clean. There's a lot of snack to choose from in their kitchen as well.

i love this movie theater! they have leather reclining seats so you can get comfortable while watching a movie. the only thing about this place is that the seating are reserved so you really have to mind what showtimes you will get.
