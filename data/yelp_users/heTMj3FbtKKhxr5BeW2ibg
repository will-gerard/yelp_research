Amazing service tonight. I had a little issue with my dish, nothing major. But the chef literally came to the table, shook our hands, apologized and then insisted we had a flan on him. Which might I add is AMAZING. Between our outstanding server Matthew and Chef Alex I was very impressed with Blanco and will definitely be back again soon. Get the flan you will not regret it!!

This js long overdue but I'm obsessed with all the Dutchies here. I always am at this location when I have the time and there has never been a bad day for one of the staff here. Always so warm, happy and welcoming. The drinks are so amazing as well. I would give them a higher rating if I could because five stars is still too low! Happy Holidays !

I have never dealt with such a rude "manager" before. I called to cancel my account because I had a contract for a six month fee for tanning and was still getting charged the next month. I was confused why. So I gave the store a ring. Apparently because I signed a contract saying I have to come in and cancel it before a certain date there wasn't anything I could do about it. The girl just kept giving me a bratty attitude saying, it was my fault and that I signed the contract. She seriously stated the fact I signed a contract over 10 times. I understand it, I didn't read the contract all the way through yes, but what I was so taken aback by was the way this girl handled the whole situation. I felt like I was arguing with a four year old girl. She was just ready to get snappy with me the second I answered the phone. Obviously I was confused and just asking a few questions because I really just wanted to cancel my membership and didn't want to drive all the way there. I wasn't looking to start a fight. I will never go back here again because of that. We all get that time of the month sweetie, no need to take it out on your customers.

I've been coming here for years but will no longer return to this location. The front desk girls are rude especially the current manager. I have a crazy schedule and have made appointments before appointments coming up and the girls didn't cancel in the system either so it marked me as a no show a few times. Instead of listening to my situation, the manager argued with me and put me on a walk in only basis. The service has gone down hill even the waxers aren't as good. They never listen and do my brows way too thin. Considering I buy a yearly pass here, it's a total let down and I'll be trying a new location or just taking my business elsewhere.

Hands down my favorite place to eat in North Scottsdale. I stay up at night laying in bed craving the guacamole, my taste buds have forever changed because of it. Get an organic margarita, best and most flavorful thing at Sol besides those sweet sweet sweeeeet potato tacos that you won't be able to stop ordering because they are so delicious. Sol will change your life, forever.

This is my happy place! So clean, so welcoming. Great prices for everyone. Every level is welcome and beginners are always applauded at the end of class which I find so encouraging for all levels. Today I even had a teacher take time after class to go over a pose I've been having a hard time accomplishing. Every teacher here genuinely cares about you and your practice. If you've never been here you have to try it at least once and you'll see why so many people are hooked!

A little hard to find at first the location is right in the back corner of old town. Other than that.. The staff is super professional and super friendly. The inside is also really nice and held to a very clean standard. This is the place to go to for a spa! Will definitely be coming back again and again.

I am the last person to be impatient in a retail setting because I work retail and I understand things can get busy but let me tell you this was an awful experience.   I went in with two bags full of coach bags, vintage juicy, guess dresses, guess tops, and a Dooney and Bourke bag. The girl at the counter told me my wait would be 30 minutes long and that I could look around. 45 minutes later after I looked around and. couldn't find anything I wanted,I checked in and they hadn't even touched my bag and told me it wouldn't be much longer. Another fifteen or twenty minutes passes by and the bags were still untouched. At that point I left and got Starbucks down the road, came back and they still hadn't touched my bags. Finally they realized it had been over an hour and a half that they had kept me waiting, so they started looking through my things.  They should have spared me and just told me to come back another day. The manager looked flustered and quickly went through my things only to buy a cheap scarf and a few cheap dresses, I thought maybe they missed a bag full, but they didn't sadly.   Woohoo, I got twenty dollars and wasted almost two hours of my time.  Just from an outsiders view this place needs to get the staff under control, it was poorly managed, and everyone was rude. It was clear the manager was stressed which stressed her staff out, which was pissing customers off. The only reason they get a star was because the new location is much better and spacious.   Now I'm sitting here at Tip and Toes (which is amazing) down the road unwinding, because that place really got me heated, and that takes a lot. Thanks for the pedicure, Platos

I hate writing reviews of places that are negative, I do. I wish I had some good things to say and I have a few good things but not as many as I hoped.   So. Let's start with the pros before the cons here. This is a stunning complex, the maintenance guys are outstanding and work hard to keep the place clean and tidy always. The pool and gym are fantastic. There are many grills on the property and a bark park for your furry family members and we got a great move in deal. There is an awesome coffee machine in the office. The location is near everything you could want or need. The apartments are adorable and modern with all new appliances and with stylish floor plans.  Now here is my frustration with the last 9 months my boyfriend and I have experienced, thank god we did not sign a longer lease.   The parking is ridiculous here, the amount of spaces to the amount of residents in this complex is highly frustrating. There is a pass system but be warned if you park your car with the wrong pass for even a second, tow trucks swarm this complex like vultures. We learned that the hard way when both of our cars and even my visitor were towed within 48 hours. We also loved watching people get their cars towed New Years morning, wow I bet that was a great wake up call for 2016. No shame there.  By the way, the only warning you or your guests that your vehicle is subject to being towed is on ONE small red sign hidden behind a big PALM tree and no where else as you drive in to the complex. There's gotta be a law that's definitely being broken there.   The management never hears you out as a person, every manager we have ever dealt with on this property has never listened but only told us we were in the wrong and are so on the defense about things that they just are not listening to you. They are always ready to argue and basically insult you.    Shall we dive a little deeper?   The residents. If you enjoy being woken up to the sounds of your walls shaking from the nightly sports car show in the parking lot and garages then welcome home! Rev those engines boys. People treat their garages as if they are running a mechanic shop out of them, no joke.   Oh and no worries, if those residents aren't using the garages as a show room for their cars, they are probably housing their innocent dog in the garage while the temperature is 30 degrees at night until midnight or later. No joke. I couldn't ask for a more calming noise then the howling of a suffering animal down the hall to fall asleep to.   While I do understand management can't control everything that happens here when they are closed, empathy, compassion and a sense of efficiency is something that does not shine through at Camden Hayden. Spare yourself the high rent because when there is a problem you the resident are probably in the wrong, and make sure your friends are cool with parking at the Carl's Jr next door if they want to come over.   Shout out to the employees that do stand out though, customer service is always noted and it shows when people genuinely care; Albert and MoÃ«t, you the real mvps. Thanks for always coming through and being so outstanding.  Seriously stroll next door over to Sotelo and ask for Albert, go to w6 or even Grigio were you get what you pay for.   I hope the other Camden properties are better because this whole experience has been mostly a disappointment.  We are happy to hand over our keys as our lease terms come to an end on Sunday and seriously hope management gets a handle of things one day, there is so much potential here.   Xoxo
