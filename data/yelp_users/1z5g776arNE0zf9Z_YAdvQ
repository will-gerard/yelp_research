Went to Taylor's Cafe for a fear that the line at LGO and Over Easy would be too long.  I wish I would have waited in line.  The place was pretty empty so you would have thought our sever would have been a little more attentive.   My cousin ordered scrambled eggs with an english muffin and they came out how she had asked.  I ordered the french toast which I was highly disppointed in.  First, it had raisins in it-which it didn't state on the menu.  Secondly, it was severely undercooked and runny in the middle.  I had to sit and stare at it's grossness (yeah I know that isn't a word) so long that by the time our waitress came to check on us I didn't want a new one so I ordered just an english muffin so I didn't have to leave starving.  Disppointing and I don't think I'll return.

I had my first experience at Liberty Market this past weekend. I am now HOOKED!    A nice older gentleman greeted us at the line and gave us the run down on what to expect.    They get your tastbuds going with having to pass by a gigantic glass counter filled with yummy looking treats-cinnamon buns the size of my 3 year olds head, red velvet cake (my fav), sticky buns, gigantic cupcakes etc.    I had the Italian Scramble and YUMMMMOOOO!  The Schrieners Italian sausage was so delish and the potatoes smothered in cheese-so good.  Its hard to pick my favorite part but the homemade biscuit that I drizzled with honey was to die for.    I also loved my perfectly mixed carafe of mimosa. Really can't wait to visit Liberty Market again!

Here is why I have to give this place 5 stars.  My husband and I started making Delux our "date lunch" place every Tuesday a few months ago.  (see we have two kids and rarely get to eat without the little ones).    Since we go on the same day we've become familiar with a lot of the wait staff.  We prefer Bobby in most cases-super nice guy working his way towards medical school-loves to gab and gives EXCELLENT service.  He sees us walk in and comes to our table with two tropical ice teas in hand.  Usually we order the same thing-at least husband does-I like to switch it up so after confirming that my husband wants the usual he's off with our order.  Depending on how busy they are we chat with a few of the other servers too.  Since we are frequent visitors we don't even have to show our "VIP" card anymore.    Don't count out their turkey burger-I'm not a big turkey burger fan as they tend to be dry but this one is always delish.  The hot dog and chicken panini are also tasty and who can forget the Classic Standard Burger.  Hands down best sweet potato fries on the planet!  We love Delux and their super staff!

Spent a super fun evening at Tao Nightclub with some really good friends.  Their music is great-lots of hiphop and not too much house music.  It gets crowded but we had our own table and roped off area so we didn't mind too much the throngs of people everywhere.    I know a lot of people complain about the crowds in Vegas nightclubs but if there isn't a crowd then the place must suck.  TAO does not suck :)  Go there.

This is hands down our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  We live all the way across town yet making the 35 mile drive (one way) is totally worth it.    The service is outstanding and everyone is really friendly.  Our favorite person though is Bobby.  Bobby used to be our server at another area restaurant and we were pleased as punch when we ran into him one day here.  It's kind of like visiting a friend when you go there!    My only problem is I can never decide if I should get the short rib tacos or the ribeye steak tacos.  Start off with their sangria that I could go swimming in or the shaken lemondae then finished by the red velvet cake and you can't go wrong.  Love this place and I'll be back.  Often.

I have only been here two times.  Being a creature of habit I stick with what I know and I know that the salt and pepper shrimp and Chilean Sea Bass are very tasty.  The lobster bisque is quite good as well.  Both times we have been there the service has been excellent.  Ask to be seated in Mike's section-he won't disappoint.

Since visiting in late 2008 we have been here numerous times.  We just love it.  We had a little birthday gathering for my hubby this past Saturday and our sever Charlie was on top of it.  He had some helpers as there was 16 of us but he was just fantastic!    I tried for the first time the Seared Ahi Tuna Steak and I think I will have dreams about it until I have the pleasure of visiting Wildfish again!

I'm yelping out Tarbells a few months late beause I forgot to do it right after my first visit!   Hubby took me for Valentine's Day this year.  Great little romantic spot.  He tried the spaghetti and meatballs-didn't like it at all.  Felt that the sauce was a little bland and watered down.  I ordered the filet-which came out perfect and melted in my mouth-so good.  The manager came by and asked how our food was-I encouraged hubby to be honest.  He was.  They apologized profusely.  He then ordered the pan roasted chicken-loved it.  They also offered to make me a new meal since it was Valentine's Day and "i shouldn't have to eat alone."  Hubby didn't mind so I kept eating.  Mark Tarbell came by after the chicken came out to make sure it was to hubby's liking.  What do you say to the owner/Iron Chef?  Hell yeah he liked it!  In the end the wonderful manager at Tarbells comp'd our ENTIRE meal-4 glasses of wine, salads, appetizer and meals!  He said he did this since it was Valentines Day and they wanted the night to be perfect for us.  You don't come across such great service everyday.

I love Pita Jungle.  Mainly I visit for their hummus and ice tea.  Plus the shrimp/pita/tomato thingy is to die for!  Parking at the 44th/Indian School road location is a nightmare so just run in and pick it up!

Jimmy & Joe's Pizza oh how I love thee and miss thee.  Terry Black (owner) is one of the friendliest people I have ever met and his daughter Amy that runs the store when he is not there is equally so.    On to the pizza.  Its good-got a little kick of spice in the sauce.  You can't beat the lunch special and if you are feeding a crowd make sure you order the Big Jimmy.  I would have given it 5 stars but I have had an occasion or two when the pizza was a little below average.

Wasn't really a fan.   Thought it was a little overpriced for bar food.  Serivce wasn't exactly the best. I'd rather make the drive up to Tempe for Four Peaks.

We had our first dining experince at Cut this past weekend and it totally lived up to they hype.    I've never had a steak cooked more perfectly.  The yukon gold mashed potatoes, roasted carrots with artichokes and sauteed spinach were simple yet delicious.    Our waiter provided us with excellent service and I love that their menus are on an iPad 2!

I have only been to Covet once and that was because my hair guy-Joel Porter (formerly of Salon Jo-el right across the street) recently moved his salon into the Covet store.  The store seemed awesome and they have a great selection of men's shoes.  I highly recommend going to see Joel, Jamie or Cassie have your hair done though! And then you can check out the store!

Spent a fun evening hanging out in The Living Room enjoying some Ole' American Mules before heading upstairs to check out the rooftop bar.  Loved the laid back lounge.  Upstairs was a lot of fun too-great dj and fun crowd.  Will go back when it's not 150 degrees outside!

Made our first visit to The Mission a few weeks ago to celebrate our friends birthday.  Our reservation was for 8 pm and my hubby and I were about 20 minutes early.  The table wasn't quite ready yet so we had a seat in the little "waiting area."  The sweet hostess brought us some cute little complimentary margarita tasters.  A nice touch I thought for waiting.  The cantelope one was nice and refreshing.    Once our table on the patio was ready we were escorted outside to the nicely lit back patio-it had a nice vibe to it.  I was pleased to find out our waiter was Sam.  I had read in other Yelpers reviews that Sam was the man.  And he was! He was very informative, checked on our table at all the right times and didn't bug us too much.  He had a great personality and made our experience even more enjoyable.  So all in all our service was top notch!  The food:  I see other people complaining-maybe they don't understand that The Mission is more of a gourmet latin american restaurant (read: smaller portions).  But that didn't bother me.  My barbacoa tacos were absolutely delicious!  Small tortillas but piled with barbacoa-just the way it should be!    We all enjoyed the tableside guacamole-made to perfection.  For my drink I had The Missionary-a perfect blend of margarita and sangria.  (I had a few of those actually).  Everyone at our table raved about the excellent food and drinks-we were all pleased.    Sam ordered a pumpkin bread pudding for my friend the birthday girl.  We ended up ordering two more as they were absolutely amazing!  I don't even like bread pudding but I do love pumpkin so I tried it.    The Mission is an ideal spot for a date night or for a nice spot to gather with friends for a special occassion.  We will be back several times in the future!

Blu Burger is one of the last surviving restaurants in the AJs plaza at Chandler Heights and Alma School.  I fear that after AJ's closes later this year so will Blu Burger and good ridance.   Our family is a huge Delux fan and I wish that Delux would come to the EV because the food at Blu Burger was mediocre.  I got the california chicken sandwich-which was overloaded with spices-no mention of spices on the menu and my husband had the build your own Angus burger.  He said it was bland.  They couldn't even get the sweet potato fries right!    The kids mini burgers at $5 a pop were a total rip off.  If you are going to make food smaller then charge less.  I for one am tired of restaurants over charging on kids food.    The wait staff was as bland as the food and they all looked and acted like they couldn't wait until closing time.   Don't think I will be visting Blu Burger again!

I wanted to like the Parlor too.  It has a nice cool vibe with modern decor.  I've heard great things about the food and that the service was sub-par and to say sub-par is an understatement.  In my opinion our service totally sucked.  Here's why.  I met a friend there for dinner around 5:15 last night-before the rush.  There was our table plus another 2 or 3 in the whole place.  It took at least 15 minutes for our server to come back after bringing us waters to take our order.  We each ordered the 8" make your own pizza-mine was easy.  Cheese, vine ripened tomatos plus spinach.  We both got side salads-which were really good and fresh with tasty homemade dressings.  The pizzas came out and it didn't look like there was spinach on mine-and there wasn't.    I patiently waitied about 5 minutes or so for the waitress to come see if our food came out alright and I told her that mine didn't have the spinach on it.  She says "i'll go put spinach on it."  she leaves and returns a couple minutes later with my pizza.  She sets it down and walks away.  The spinach she put on my pizza was cold and wet and just piled on top.  I look at my friend and say "What am I supposed to do with this?"  First I am 3 1/2 months pregnant-you don't mess with a pregnant womans food but I have NEVER been given pizza topped with cold wet spinach.  I don't eat it and wait for her to come back.  She returns and I say "I really hate to be a pain the ass" and she she says something under her breath but all I hear is "somewhat"  I ignore it and ask her if she could have the kitchen sprinkle a smidge more cheese on the top and pop the pizza back in the oven so that the spinach isn't cold and wet.  She snips "if they put the pizza back in the oven it will get charred-just so you know."  I'm thinking-they screwed it up and now if I want it fixed it will be burnt?  I say "can they just put it in there for like, 20 seconds so the cheese melts?"  she says (rudely) "I'll see what I can do but I'm going to have to charge you for extra cheese"  (each topping is a dollar).  I say fine, whatever.    She brings me my pizza back and it isn't charred-lucky for her.  And when we got our bill she didn't charge me for the extra cheese-which I would've just taken out of her tip anyway.   the food was good but like I said horrible service.  I'll have to really, really want to go there again to endure being treated like that again.

Went here two times in the same weekend we loved it so much!  Rafael (one of the managers) was very gracious and accomodating to our party. He brought us several appetizers to try-the walnut shrimp, bacon shrimp poppers and philly cheesesteak dumplings.  The dumplings were my favorite and everyone else really loved the walnut shrimp (I'm allergic to nuts to I couldn't try them).  I shared the french dippity doo with one of my friends and it comes on hot challah bread-divine.  The rest of our party loved their food as well.    I'd highly recommend the Cherry Popper Panty Dropper (drink) very yummy and refreshing and end your meal with their homemade donuts!  They are unlike any donut you've ever had!  We loved it at First and we will be back each time we visit Vegas!

Our family loves Swirl It!  My kiddos get giddy helping themselves to the yogurt (big deal for a 5 and 3 year old) and then piling on the toppings.  I also love the set up they have to keep the kiddies occupied with some Nick Jr.   Friendly staff and super clean!

Had breakfast here recently with my hubby and any place related to LGO we are fans of.   The pancakes were gigantic and appley-super yummy. I'd love to go again soon to try something new but I have a feeling Liberty Market would be my first breakfast choice!

After a friend raving about this place for 6 months I had to go.  I'd say my turkey sanwich was pretty average. I'd never go again simply for the fact they don't have Sweetener for their unsweetened iced tea.  Boo.

After hearing wonderful things about Beckett's Table we were eager to try it out for date night.  First impression-I wish it was in a better part of town and it appears they are going for the whole Chelsea's Kitchen vibe with ambiance.    Their food doesn't even compare to CK however.   Our server was Cort and he was nice enough. Didn't wow me but servers don't need to as long as they are nice.    He recommended for apps the cheddar bacon biscuits and the bacon Mac n' cheese.  The biscuits were dry and just ok.  The Mac n' cheese was meh.  My husband ordered the chicken which in the center had cold spots.  We told our server who took it back to the kitchen and a new one was prepared.  When the manager brought it out she remarked "do want to see if it's hot enough for you now?". We all thought that was rude.  People don't go to restaurants and hope for their food to be cold!  I had the fork tender short ribs.  They were good but just average.    My friend had the pork chop which was also good and her husband the pork stew which he described as "hearty but not fantastic."  We will not be making a repeat visit.  The food was mediocre and in fact is still sitting in my stomach like a rock.

I stumbled across The Secret Village today on my way to work and their fantabulous window display practically gave me whiplash.  I just had to go on my lunch break..and I'm so glad that I did.  This place is amazing.  They have some great finds-everything from a gynormous wooden horse to lovely little trinkets with something for every budget.    I enjoyed a nice little chat with one of the owners Bonnie and she was really sweet and sincere.  She asked me some genuine questions about what I thought about the store, what made me decide to come in etc and I thought that was very nice.  Currently they have 2 buildings open with their 3rd on the way.  I can't wait for the grand opening soon!    Unfortunately I was feeling slightly overwhelmed and I couldn't decide what I wanted (out of several items) but I'm happy I have a new spot to shop at lunchtime.    The Secret Village-I'll be back :)

Our family loves FROST!  I personally don't like how much it costs for the 5 of us to go so for that reason we keep it a special treat.  The staff is so friendly and sweet.  Always a nice touch!  I'm somewhat addicted to the cheesecake gelato with strawberry sorbet either in a cup, cone or shake I can't seem to order anything different!!    Their flavors are authentic and surprisingly low in calories and fat!  Bonus for the waistline!!

I am not sure if we just really had a bad experience or if other reviewers are totally crazy.  After reading all the great reviews about Vintage 95 we (myself, the hubby and two other couples) decided to venture here.  Things we did like:  The patio is super cute and quaint.  We had some great weather and our server Eric was fantastic.  Plus they had one of my favorite wines-Dr. Loosen Reisling.  Now on to the bad.  We tried the bruschetta which according to many reviews was top notch.  We only tried the goat cheese and bacon jam (out of curosity) and the mozzarella with grape tomatoes.  Eric really talked up the bacon jam making it seem like it would be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted.  It was the complete opposite.  It was very underwhelming and loaded with salt.    I had the ahi tuna dish which was pretty good but again-loaded with salt.  I felt so dehydrated the next day from all the salt I had!  My hubby ordered a burger which came over cooked.  He returned it to the kitchen and they corrected it.  But this is the really bad.  3 of our friends ordered the stuffed poblano.  It sounded like it would be delish.  One of my friends said that hers was cold inside.  Like flat out cold.  Gross.  Then her hubby and our other friend that ordered it said the same thing.  We informed Eric who returned them to the kitchen.  The manager came out to offer his apology and informed them that it would be 5-6 minutes for them to return.  15 minutes later they did.  The EXACT same dishes, not reheated but simply piled with new sauce AND when they brought them back to the table they had no idea who's plate was who's.  The gal that brought them back just set them down like they were brand new dishes-totally ignoring the fact that one of them had been cut into pieces!  SO TACKY.  Needless to say everyone was totally disgusted at that point.  We once again told Eric and he was more then apologetic.  I felt really bad for him actually.  And once again we received a visit from the manager.  He whisked the dishes away and promptly took an order for some salads for them.  Which they actually liked.    I really tried to give this place 2 stars. I mean in the end the service we received was exceptional.  The manager was more then gracious about the situation and rectified the problem, I just can't do it though.   We will not be back.  Ok so after I posted my original review I received the absolute most sincere email from the manager Gavin.  Because of this email I changed my review to two stars and all of us that attended the other night said we would be willing to give it another shot (maybe not order food) because of his email. Plus they did have a great atmosphere on the patio and a great wine list :) I have had bad experiences before and have voiced my opinion but I have never had a manager take the time to review my posted comments and contact me.  So you know never know...maybe we will be back and fingers-crossed our experience will be much better.

Since going to Federal Pizza for the first time last Thursday (as in July 25th) I have now been there three times in the last week.  3!!  I am addicted to the watermelon and mint wine coolers (only $5 at lunch).  I have had the meatball pizza, margarita pizza and caprese sandwich.  ALL DELISH!!  Obviously I'll be back...tomorrow perhaps :)

Since our first visit to Joyride Taco House on July 7th we have been there numerous times.  We are huge fans of Upward Projects restaurants.  It's one of those restaurants where you just like "being" there.  Great music, great service, yummy food and don't get me started on the Mazatlan Mules-hands down my favorite current drink!!

I had the pleasure of meeting Jayd yesterday for an airbrush tan.  She totally makes you feel at ease being in your birthday suit.  She brought me from pasty white to having a sun kissed glow in less then 30 minutes!    Her customer service is top-notch as well.  I received an email from her letting me know a few simple steps to take prior to my tan and this morning she even text me to see how I liked my tan!  She will be my go-to person from now on for airbrush tanning!
