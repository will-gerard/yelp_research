I will reserve the 5th star for when I try the food, but the menu, wine, service, and ambiance are all top notch!

A lot of the inventory is damaged,  disorganized,  and out of place.  Everything had a thin coat of dirt on it up at the counter.

Jeremy cleaned our yard thoroughly and quickly!  He was friendly and professional.  I know who to call next time our yard is a mess!

I've been at Haboob for a little over one year and I love it! The coaches are very knowledgeable, and the members are fun. I love being a part of this community!

It hurts me to give this place a bad review. The food is amazing! But this was my second time with awful customer service from the same worker and I can't let it slide. The first time we all got our wonderful meals but one if the orders was wrong. Usually that doesn't matter, but the guy was 100% unapologetic and didn't offer to fix it.  We gave it a second shot because goodness gracious the food rocks. But this time the same guy took our order and I very clearly pointed at something on the gluten free menu and said I wanted it with the gluten free sauce. My boyfriend got a similar dish. He brought them out, both wrong, and I ate half of one before realizing it wasnt what I ordered so I went up to the front to make sure what I was eating was in fact gluten free. Turns out it wasn't. I told him what I had ordered and he ARGUED with me! What? He told me I was wrong and didn't offer one word of apology or even sympathy. Even if the customer is wrong, you have to be polite. Especially if they have a food allergy and expressed that to you when ordering. I hate to abandon this place, but that guy was awful to us twice. Wont be back until this dude is gone.

I had to wait about 10 minutes past my appointment time, but otherwise I had a great experience! The massage chairs are the BEST part. Great color selection, sturdy gel manicure, fun design options, clean (clean looking because you never can tell) facilities and tools, and decent service. I will definitely be back.

I'm here at least once every day - - usually twice.  The coffee is SO drinkable. I'm a lifetime coffee snob, and I could drink gallons of this stuff black.  My favorite is the Vanilla Macadamia roast which is the first flavored coffee I haven't snubbed.   The beans are wonderful and I buy them to brew at home as well.  I love that they use french press for every cup,  and that they measure the weight of espresso before every shot poured. Quality matters. They have a huge variety of milks,  and even grass-fed butter and coconut oil for my bulletproof coffee fix. Oh and the GREEN TEA is incredible.  I add a stevia (WHICH THEY HAVE),  and it's heaven.  When it is hot outside,  I regularly drink 64 iced oz of it per day.  No joke. I drive them nuts.   Oh and if you are into it,  they have a huge variety of flavors made from real cane sugar,  and some pretty creative whipped cream selections.  I've also heard rumors of protein shakes,  milk shakes,  and other yummy creations.   QUICK TIP: if you are short on sleep, and wanting a sweet fix,  try the Undertow... You won't regret it.   Shout out to the Tempe Manager Whitney! She is the best! The customer service rocks,  and the regulars definitely get too many free drinks.  All of the employees are friendly and hilarious,  and learn your name right away.  And you can get a really good deal if you use the punch cards.   I really can't say enough about how great Kona is.

Firstly,  the two women students who currently work here are fine.  Anything that is lacking in their training is not their fault,  and they are perfectly nice.  I think they do their best,  and sometimes go above and beyond to be friendly.   That being said,  Charlies consistently provides some of the worst coffee and customer service I have ever experienced at a coffee shop.  The only reason I ever purchase anything at Charlies is out of absolute desperation.   I'm constantly amazed at how bad the coffee is.  They use a  decent brand for beans,  so either the beans are old or the espresso and coffee machines have never been cleaned.  The drinks taste bitter and burned in a way even the darkest roast should not.  It is worse than break room coffee at a government job (which is to say that it is also worse than no coffee).   The fresh pastries are average,  and I appreciate the effort to have gluten free and vegetarian meals.  I have never had any of the sandwiches so I cannot speak to all of the food.  It would be wonderful to have some healthier snacks but that is probably asking too much.   The service is the true reason for the single star.  I cannot understand why there is only one person working during their busiest hours.  It regularly takes more than 15 minutes to get through a 3 person line,  and that does not count the time it takes to get your drink. Some of the employees are very rude,  and sneer at simple requests like for hot water or ice in your personal cup. Other employees who are more courteous are constantly overwhelmed by the amount of customers during peak hours.   Oh,  and the hours? Who knows what the are. I think they close at four, which is way too early for a LAW SCHOOL coffee shop where caffeine is in higher demand than adderall.   When I have more than 10 minutes I always walk to Starbucks,  Dutch Brothers, The Well or any other place.    Ok enough.

Since my last yelp review, things have gotten SLIGHTLY better at Charlie's.  They must have done something to clean the machines because the coffee is now tolerable.  And the women baristas are still INCREDIBLY nice.  But the place is still pretty awful.  This morning they were out of coffee filters.  So they were actually OUT OF COFFEE.  AT 9:00 AM.  ON A TUESDAY MORNING.  AFTER A HOLIDAY WEEKEND.  It's not like they had the ENTIRE WEEKEND to go out and shop and make sure they were stocked or anything.  I heard them talking about trying to make the coffee with paper towels instead of filters.  No.  Just no.   To their credit, the women made Americanos instead which tasted really nice, but it took longer, and the new barista was confused about how to charge customers for it, so the guy in front of me paid close to $5, while I only paid $.90.    Figure this out guys!  Also, they charge an annoying fee for using cards, including debit. No one carries cash anymore guys.

Do they even have regular hours? First day of classes and they are closed before 3 PM. I can't even.
