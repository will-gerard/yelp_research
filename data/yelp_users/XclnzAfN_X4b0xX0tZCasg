We used to frequrent the Native off Guadalupe and Dobson before we moved to this side of town, we loved the food there and the servers. However we have gone to this location a half dozen times and the last 3 times we were very unsatisfied with the service and the warmth (lack of) of the wings. The last time we went we had brought our 3 month old (first wing and beer outing in how long??) After we were completely done and the server received her tip she told us that we could not have our baby in the bar. Really if that was your policy it would have been better to know at the onset.

I took all of the required brokers courses from Arizona School of Real Estate. Loved the classes and the instructors were great. All having many years of experience and bringing various aspects of real estate to the classes.

Love the desert heat wings. Lots of TV's for your sports viewing. The service is generally good the last couple times we have had to return the queso dip as it came to the table lukewarm. Each time the server was very apologetic.
