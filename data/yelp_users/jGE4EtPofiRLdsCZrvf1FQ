Stingy. Otherwise a nice location.  I first want to begin by saying that I've been loyal to Starbucks for quite some time now. I'm on a first name basis with staff from a couple locations. Usually service is great at all the locations and they do a great job of accommodating your needs. You can trust me when I say I spend plenty of money with them.  Today, however, they came off rather...stingy. They're having this promotion where if you buy a holiday drink they give you a sticker in this little book. Get 5 and you earn a free drink. I had two in one book and two in another and they told me that they won't combine them... I was assured by another staff member on the Shea location just a few miles away that they would allow me to combine the two...you could say I'm irked and dissatisfied.   Also, I've never had a problem getting venti iced waters at any Starbucks location in Arizona or California. (Always with the purchase of a drink too...) Today, however, after paying 10 bucks for a pair of drinks that I was expecting to pay 5 for, I asked for two venti iced waters and the guy told me I could have two grande waters. I smiled and obliged but walked away disgusted with their service.   Honestly, at 5 bucks for a damn drink giving away a couple iced waters to loyal customers is a drop in the bucket for such a large corporation... And what ever happened to the "Just say yes." policy? I expect more from them.  Otherwise I like the location for how spacious and rarely crowded it is. I will likely be back to study here but if they continue to rub me the wrong way I will gladly take my business elsewhere... Not to mention how they've taken away some of the Gold Card member privileges. STEP IT UP SBUX!

If you're a person of color, you may not get great service.  I've been coming to Saigon Nites several times a year for 6 years, ever since I was a senior in high school. Anytime I stop by, whether it be with my friends (East Asian, South Asian, etc) or family, we are hardly acknowledged and given barely passable service. On the other hand, tables of white patrons nearby are greeted with smiles and attentive service.   I've been to many a hole-in-the-wall pho restaurant where the staff are unfriendly to everybody, but it is clear that there is a preference for white customers at Saigon Nites. It is only slightly bothersome, but after stopping by last week and seeing that nothing has changed over the last 6 years of giving them my business, I think it's worth mentioning here.  Their pho tastes good, but is distinctly different from more traditional pho. The broth tastes leaner and thinner bodied than some of the best pho spots in SoCal but is still very flavorful.

This is the pinnacle of quality coffee in AZ. Cartel introduced me to the complexity of flavors in those coffee beans and taught me coffee shouldn't have an over-roasted, stale, and scorched flavor. Ever since that first cup of Santa Julia I've been hooked! (hope the Santa Julia comes back -_-) My favorite coffee now though is the Atitlan.   They roast coffee in house and brew your coffee by the cup. They brew with the aeropress, v60, chemex and clever depending on how much coffee you want. You should definitely purchase whole bean and be brewing their beans at home too! If espresso is your thing, they also do that really well. I'm not really an espresso guy but there's is very good. Also, lattes and cappuccinos are amazing. Perfect balance of milk and espresso. That goes for the mocha too, the chocolate makes the drink sweet without overpowering the espresso.  As far as ambiance goes, it's a bit loud. They have the music louder than most coffee shops so if you need peace and quiet than this may not be the place for you. I still manage to get work done here all the time but it's not the most peaceful environment. If you're here to socialize, however, Cartel is your place! Cartel also makes their own beer now and brews tea as well. I'm not very experienced with craft beer though so I will let you judge how good theirs are. I've had one green tea here and it was delicious. I'm not very knowledgable about tea either so I'll leave that to you guys.  I've tried a bunch of places around Scottsdale because that's where I live and they all fall short. Press Coffee in Scottsdale makes great coffee equally as good. But their lattes and cappuccinos are...the same drink. It frustrates me to have a cappuccino that has way too much milk in it. Tastes like I'm drinking steamed whole milk...actually. Altitude Coffee Lab is a brand new coffee shop in Scottsdale and also makes great fresh coffee and roasts in house. The problem is that they don't brew by the cup. I can find places that come close to Cartel, but they all fall short! Cartel needs a North Scottsdale location.  Anyway, if you're on the fence about it, get your butt down to Cartel and have some delicious coffee! No one does it better!

Service has to be pretty bad for me to complain and let me tell you that Pho Thanh has some of the worst service. Come here for a bowl of hot pho, not for a local dining experience.  Waiters legitimately do not want to talk at all. A guy came by to take our orders and asked if we were ready, then proceeded to not mutter another word even when he didn't understand what we wanted. He managed to mime out hand signals that let us know to clarify what number or order we wanted. Mind you, the guy speaks English very well. When he returned with our food, we asked him to remove appetizer plates and he literally froze for a second before turning around to walk away without muttering anything at all. Then, when I was standing in line to pay, another waiter decides to take a shortcut between me and the guy in front of me and steps on my shoes without apologizing at all. I was the last person in line at the cashier and there was plenty of space behind me and only a narrow gap in front of me.  Some of the best local restaurants in Phoenix thrive because they offer a great customer experience along with their great food. Pho Thanh fails horribly at offering any customer experience. Each customer is simply another $6 bowl of pho that needs to be moved along promptly. I would've gave them 3 stars if their Pho was good but it was not as good as in the past. The beef felt tough and noodles did not seem fresh. I've had better from them before but I always prefer Da Vang.   For having to put up with shitty staff and get barely above average Pho noodles makes me not want to return here.

Giant gets an extra star since my last review one year ago.  Many of my criticisms in my initial review remain, however, I had a really narrow, strict idea of what a good local coffee shop is at that time. Even though they aren't a roastery and their manual coffee brewing apparatuses are fewer than Press or Cartel, they are a great café serving great coffee with pretty good service and a good atmosphere.  I love that I can get Four Barrel whole beans when I'm not in the mood for Cartel or Press and that they offer a french press option (usually neglected by most third wavers and viewed as second class I think). Moreover, Giant feels like a real local café made for the Phoenix coffee community.  I used to work downtown so I could stop by Giant frequently but since I quit I'm now very out of the way. I look forward to my next trip to Giant!

The best coffee Arizona has to offer!  Cartel Coffee Lab does it all. They send their roaster down to South/Central America to source great coffee, they roast coffee themselves in Tempe, AZ and they brew the coffee in a way that respects the chemistry of the bean and ensures the resulting cup is of the highest quality. Other AZ cafes come close, often offering great cups of coffee, but none are as involved in the process from farm to cup as Cartel is! Trust me, you, the customer, are the beneficiary of all their crazy coffee worship.  Cartel also has several cafes that all have their own unique personality. This 5th Ave location in Old Town is one of the friendliest, most welcoming and relaxing of their cafes. Great place to get work done and the baristas seem to cater to the crowd in setting the ambiance. If everyone's in with friends getting (alcoholic) beverages then the music will be turned up a bit and more upbeat, if everyone's got their laptops out or their nose buried in a book the music will be a bit more calm.   My favorite drinks are any of their hand-brewed coffees, the cappuccino, the cortado and the one-and-one (ask your barista!).  Oh, and I could rant for an hour about why complaints about price are irrational but i'll keep it short. Coffee is an agricultural product that requires an ENORMOUS amount of work to grow and process. If you take a second to think about where your coffee comes from and all the hands that work to bring it to you, you'll wonder why each cup doesn't cost $10 and each bag doesn't cost $50!

Crepe Bar is fantastic! Great people, great food, great service AND world-class coffee to boot.  My sister and I had the breakfast burro and the smoked turkey and both were delicious savory crepes. We also had complimentary little snacks and desert which were very well done. The presentation on the entrees, snacks and coffee were exceptional.  Now to the coffee! The good folks at Crepe Bar have brought some of the best coffee in the world from the Pacific Northwest to our home in the desert! I've had about 4-5 different offerings of Heart Coffee Roasters here and it never disappoints.  Crepe Bar is undoubtedly one of my new favorite places to dine in AZ.

I stopped in this afternoon with the family for a coffee and hung around for an hour or so. I'm glad we have another local shop roasting coffee in-house in Scottsdale!   The drinks were exceptional. I got a cup of the Guatemalan single-origin which was delicious. Even though they said it was a darker roast (which kind of turned me off initially) none of the complexity of the cup was lost and you could tell that the coffee was fresh. My sister had an iced chai tea latte and my dad had a latte. We all enjoyed our drinks very much.   The ambiance was nice, plenty of good seating and a good patio with a great view of the lake at Mccormick Ranch. I will definitely return to get some work done. I can see myself hanging out here in the cooler months :D.  There is room for improvement though! First, I wish that they brewed their coffee by the cup for customers. There are other places that will brew each cup to order using a chemex, aeropress, V60 or the clever. Although you will be waiting five more minutes to have your cup of joe, you know each cup is as fresh as possible. With that said, although I'd prefer my cup brewed after I order, it does save time and the cup I had at Altitude this afternoon tasted as fresh as any. Second, I wish they had more coffee offerings! A house blend and the Guatemalan were the only two that were available. They should definitely look to expand their offerings! Also, please don't start over-roasting coffee...  All in all, drinks were exceptional, ambiance and interior design were great and the location was excellent. Also, the people were friendly and service was great! I know this place is going to do really well here. I can't wait to return and try some of their food and other drinks. They only lost a star because of the two areas of improvement I listed above.

Peixoto (pay-show-toe) is the real deal. The coffee is great, the space is beautiful, and the staff are all friendly and knowledgable. Not to mention they have some pretty fly gear. La Marzocco Linea, EK43, a beastly roaster, and a slew of manual brew devices - they made all the stops. I'm sure they'd do well anywhere in the valley, but their presence in Chandler is sorely needed.   I love that they have their crop-to-cup program that sources raw coffee direct from the family farm of the owners in Brazil. I heard about this and was both excited and worried they wouldn't serve other single origin offerings. Thankfully they do have a few coffees to choose from. I had their full natural Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and it was wonderful. Their espresso was delightful - really well balanced with a big syrupy body, light sweetness and light acidity. I'm looking forward to exploring their coffees further!  Peixoto is a stellar addition to the Phoenix coffee community and I'm excited to see them grow! Go check them out!

Welcome to the family Maverick!  They serve Ritual Coffee on pour over and espresso and offer tea and smoothie options as well. For food, they have delicious savory pies and a couple of all day breakfast options I have yet to try.  They have a gorgeous open space with very well thought out seating - a great balance of tables, chairs and couches for you to settle in however you like. Baristas are friendly and knowledgable and can make a proper flat white/piccolo.  Being the Aussie inspired cafe and featuring a phenomenal roaster that hasn't been offered in Phoenix before makes Maverick a wonderful, unique addition to the Phoenix specialty coffee scene. I've been in 3 times in the 3 weeks they've been open and have seen the cafe get busier and busier. While it was quiet and not so busy a couple of weeks before, the space is now buzzing with chatter and has a great social feel to it.   Maverick is definitely in my top 5 cafes in Phoenix alongside Cartel, Press, Giant and Peixoto.
