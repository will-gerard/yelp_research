Highly disappointed. When you walked in one side of the restaurant was like someone's house, complete with high chair and papers stacked up. Food was good, but the service was bad. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. Our waitress wasn't very friendly and ignored us. We had to hunt her down a few times. When I asked to speak to the manager, the manager only apologized and told me I shouldn't leave a tip. That's not good business. I despise  this kind of service. Will never go there again. There are so many other options.

My son had the sushi and loved it. I had teriyaki chicken and it was fantastic. Miso soup was the best I ever had. Good service too!
