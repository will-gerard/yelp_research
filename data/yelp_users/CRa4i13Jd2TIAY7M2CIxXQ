The pulled pork is ok. The ribs are crap. The sauce is good but very sweet. The soda is watered down. But the biggest problem is that it is waaaaaayyyyyyy overpriced. With so many good BBQ options around the valley this is a place you should skip.

This place is a classic. It's been unchanged for years. Every once in a while they will reprint it but it looks almost the same as it did 10 years ago.    Awesome burritos. Amazing carne asada tacos. Chips are usually good. Really nice employees.

I love this place! The employees are super friendly. I am not a good cook and neither is my wife so we are always craving home style food. This place has it. The prices are fair and the food is defiantly worth the price.

Consistent and inexpensive Neds is a great place to go for lunch. The lunch special runs from 10-4 so there is plenty of time to pick up a cheap sub.

A great burger place. It could use some more consistency with the temperature and size of the fries though. I am not a fan of the new coke machines because they get really crowded when the place is busy.

Problems   #1 It takes forever....around 30 min for one pizza but most Rosatis are slow  #2 They wouldn't take a 50% off coupon I had  #3 It cost almost $25 for 5 mozzarella sticks and a large pizza?  #4 They mozzarella sticks weren't hot or even warm. The cheese inside was hard  #5 The pizza tasted horrible  I have eaten pizza from a few different Rosatis in the valley but this place was horrible.  The only good thing was that the girl who was working the front was cute.

I don't think it's fair to judge a casino on how much you win....  But it is fair to judge them on how they set up the games.   Casino Arizona uses five decks for blackjack instead of the standard six. They also use a continuous shuffling machine..... Which raises the house edge and gets about 20% more hands dealt per hour. That's total crap.   Plenty of people gamble just for fun but if the casino employees aren't nice it takes a lot of the fun out of it. At Casino Arizona the dealers aren't nice and the waitresses aren't hot.  With all of the other casinos in the valley there's no reason to go to this one.

I don't go to laundromats very often. Like once very few years. Usually when I run out of clean clothes on vacation. So I'm not an expert on them.   The lady working there was nice. And the washer and dryers were fast but a ton of the dryers (more than half maybe) were out of order. It wasn't super busy when I went but I'm sure that it could be a problem when it is.

This place is a DUMP. That's the easiest way to put it. The valet was no where to be seen. The parking garage was horrible. The elevators were slow and dirty. The rooms was disgusting. The employee I dealt with was nice enough. I paid for the room in hotels.com but I didn't stay there. I just got a room somewhere else. That's how bad it was. I uploaded some pics to show how bad it was.

They have a lot of ASU shirts for pretty good prices. They aren't the same quality as a nike shirt but if you don't feel like dropping $35 on a t-shirt at dicks and you're in the area it's worth checking out.  They also have a ton of ASU decals.

I really like this place. Its a very basic burger and fry place. It can get backed up because of the way the line is set up and the soda machine is in a really poorly chosen spot. They only take cash which is kind of annoying.   Good burger  good fries  good onions rings

very nice place. the food is pretty good but its more of the atmosphere you are going there for. They took a coupon I had that was only supposed to be good in Arizona. I would suggest just doing desert if you are not sure if you are going to like it. Desert was easily the best and most amusing part of the meal.

Typical gym. Overpriced and under cleaned.   There are a few reasons I give it one star.   They get pissed if you work out with anyone because there is no "personal training" (I guess talking to my brother every once in a while at the gym is personal training)........unless of course you buy it from them.   The sauna only worked about half the time.  The music was freaking horrible and so damn loud.   "Regulars" (I don't know what else to call them I went enough to be called a regular I guess) would hang by the front desk and try to flirt with the late night receptionist. It was super annoying when I was trying to check in and by the look on her face most nights I'm sure it was even more annoying to her.   Now the policies  I paid cash in advance for a year so I wouldn't have to give them cc info but even that was a joke. I asked about a partial refund because some things in my life had changed (mostly having a daughter) and I wasn't going to the gym that much anymore. It wasn't a huge deal just something I was wondering about. I was told there are only 2 ways to get a partial refund.  1. Proof of death (I swear I'm not lying)  2. Proof you have moved to a place that doesn't have a LA fitness within 100 miles.    Yea ok....well whatever. It's a gym so they are always going to try and get every dime they can. But my problem was mostly with the gym and the employees.

horrible store.  There are a few reason why this place should be avoided.   #1 I came in with about 25 books. I was moving some stuff around my house and didn't need them anymore so I thought what the heck Ill try to sell them. They only wanted half of them...ok no problem.   $22 in trade or $2.50  in cash...really?  Not even Gamestop in that absurd. But it doesn't stop there. For trade they just print out a voucher. I said no I'll just take the cash so she printed out a cash voucher but they had to see my ID and get a manager to sign off on it.  Hahahaha you have got to be kidding me. So anybody can bring in stolen stuff but as long as they spend the money you give them at the store who cares but to get $2.50  you need an ID and manager approval. What a freaking joke.    #2 The people who hang around this place are seedy. Like the kind of people who won't wait till they get outside to light a cigarette. Its on country club just north of southern so its not in a great neighborhood and it shows.

Costa vida can be good the problem is that it's not constantly good. Also the pricing is confusing and if you ask the employes (ex. Does a side of sour cream cost anything?) all of them will give you a different answer. I like the pork but a lot of the time it is hardly shredded at all.

Good stadium that can get really loud during good games. I have been to many college football stadium and you can't get much closer to the field than at Sun Devil Stadium. It is defiantly showing its age and needs some major upgrades or to be rebuilt. ASU says that it will happen soon. Hopefully they will do it right.

This is a good sports book. they have the games arranged by sports and then by the time they start which is awesome. So you can easily see how much time you have left to bet. I think its the only sports book  I've seen do that. Most just have the games by sports and then random or alphabetical or it seems as confusing as they can make it. there aren't enough sets but most sports books don't have enough when college football and NFL games are on.

I don't think it's fair to rate a casino on how mush you win....but I think it's very fair to rate a casino on its employees and dealers. Which at this casino for the most part, aren't very good. Not mean, they just speed through the game and don't add anything fun to it.   Drink ladies are few and far between and the table games act like changing $50 is a big deal. I know it's not Vegas but come on.

Wow! So first of all their stuff is overpriced, criminally overpriced.  Second all they do (pretty much all pawn shops FYI) is look up eBay prices and offer you like 25% of what they could sell it for on eBay. Even knowing that this place fails hard.  $100 offer for iPhone 5c with all the accessories. What a joke.

I really like the yellow curry chicken and the peanut sauce is good. The delivery is very fast. My only problem is that it is expensive....I'm not sure if I'd call it overpriced because all Thai places seem to charge to much these days but the price defiantly keeps me from eating here more.

The pulled pork sandwich is pretty good. The employees are friendly but the main reason this place gets 5 stars is because of the corn soufflé. It is so dang good. I had never heard of it before I had it at Alison's and have not seen it anywhere since. It really is that good.

I have been here twice. The first time was ok.  The second time they cut my hair way shorter than I asked and it was a pretty bad haircut overall. He never asked if he was cutting it to long or short enough he just talked in spanish to the other barbers and pretty much ignored me.   They also wouldn't accept the $2 check in coupon on yelp. Why have it on there if you won't take it?  I might be more willing to over look it except they charge $19 for a haircut. Overpriced in my opinion.

This place used to be a Taco Del Mar and it was awesome. Anyway I was really craving taco del mar and thought is give this place a try.   I got cheese enchiladas. The lady made them and rolled them up and then put them in the microwave.......I almost left right then. Really the microwave? What am I paying you for I can make crappy enchiladas at home. And as I expected they were pretty bad.  Everything here is just super bland. The rice, the red sauce, the beans etc. Its usually easy to tell a place is going to be bad when the only change half the sign from the old restaurant. Taco del Mar....into.....Taco4U.    There are plenty of good Mexican food places around this just isn't one of them.

Bad really bad pizza.  This place is defiantly quantity over quality. Yea the slice is huge but it's not any good. The soda is watered down.    I ordered a slice of cheese and a soda. It took 20 minutes for them to bring it out and they weren't even close to being busy.   This type of place makes me wonder if yelp is deleting negative reviews. There is no way this place should have as many stars as it does.

I had a friend take me and I thought he was out if his mind as we walked into some random empty looking backyard for some Mexican food. Hahaha it turned out to be pretty busy in the back.   Now the review.  Great food. Good prices. Friendly people. They can be slow at times but other than that it's great.

This place is a joke. I went here because I'm not a huge fan of GameStop. The employee here sat on the ground behind the counter on the phone for about 5 minutes before he got up and there were 3 people in the store and 2 of us were standing at the counter. And their polices are absurd no returns or exchanges except the same product.

I have been to two Americas taco shops and both were good but this location was a little better. They also have the yelp check I. For free chips which is awesome. I love the chips they remind me if the chips from Taco del Mar. The bean burrito is good. The tacos seem to vary depending on how long the meat is cooked. Defiantly a place to check out if you like Mexican food in the style of chipotle or taco del mar.

He handed he chocolate milk over the counter and all three of the employees had a drink while preparing food. It was disgusting.   I also had to ask an employee 4 times to change the diet coke because it was out but he was to busy standing around to get it done.

Not very good. The burgers are small and expensive and the fries are the same type of fries you can can at a ton of mom and pop places.   The decor is mostly metal....ok except the restaurant faces west (ya know toward the sunset) and it's Arizona so the door handles are really hot. Nice planning.

IHOP is one of those places you go to knowing its probably not going to be good but even then you get disappointed. The crepes were really bad but the pancakes were ok. The waiter was nice but the girl up front was really rude and had a "don't bother me" attitude. Just typical IHOP.
