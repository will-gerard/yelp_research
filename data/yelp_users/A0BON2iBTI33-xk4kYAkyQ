What a total lack of responsibility!    My 10 year old saved and saved to buy his 1st aquarium.  We took our time and got the tank stable and happy.  We purchased a couple of fish at this store last Friday.  They died the 1st day, and then the rest of the fish all died of a horrible fungus within a few days thereafter.  We went to our usual store on Gilbert and Germain where we explained what happened.  Mary (the Manager) and Stephanie, were fantastic.  They explained that the fish we purchased probably had a bacterial infection.  When I told them that the sick fish came from their other store, they explained that there was nothing that they could do, and called the other store.  The Manager on Chandler Blvd told Stephanie that they would not do anything for us.  They also made it very clear that the infection most likely came from the new fish.  I want to commend they staff at Gilbert and Germain.  They were very kind and understanding to my son, and warn everyone NEVER to buy fish (or anything else) from the Petsmart on Chandler Blvd and the 101!  The sell diseased fish and take no responsibility for their actions.  My son learned a hard lesson about customer service, responsibility, and integrity and is looking forward to sharing his experience with all who will listen!  Again..  DO NOT buy live animals at the Petsmart on Chandler Blvd and the 101!

All I can say is WOW!  I have been bringing in my repair work for about 10 years now.  My Tag Heuer watch band broke in a spot that was not repairable.  The band is over $1000.00 new to replace.  Lenny (the senior Rakhman) spent 3 days soaking and cleaning a decade worth of grime off the band, found a way to laser-weld the link, and made the entire watch look and feel like new!  When he gave me the price, $40.00, I almost fell over.  What an absolutely wonderful place to do business.  Local, family owned and operated, and very much aware that their name is everything!  Thank You Guys!

Absolutely wonderful!  I have been a customer of Fletchers in South Chandler for about 10 years.  Their service has always been fantastic.  The new management team (the last several months) of Joey and Courey have taken this location to new heights!  Had a horrible run of car issues (on both cars) the last few months, and they have really not only taken care of each issue, their prices are the best around.  Thanks Guys!

Had to stop by and leave a wonderful review for the guys at Jos. A. Banks on Val Vista.    I have purchased most of my dress clothing from this store and have found them to go far above and beyond every time I am in.  I had an issue with a suit coat and the dry cleaner.  I walked in with the jacket and before I could even explain what had happened, they were searching the racks for a replacement.  They explained that it was on the dry cleaner without question, and then after not being able to find my size on the shelf ordered in a replacement for me.  Standing behind their goods, and unquestioned customer service are rare today.  These guys totally rock!  Thank You!

Just re-connected with Mike at Arizona Motorcycle Service.  About a year ago, Mike picked up my ST1100 (which had been sitting idle for about 5 years) went through the bike with a fine tooth comb.  I was waiting for him to upsell or overcharge.  Never happened!  He cleaned the carbs and reccomended tires because of their age (about 10 years old!).  Nothing else!  He brought it in far less than I was expecting and then delivered the bike at no charge.  I called him yesterday..  He pulled my old paperwork and spoke like he knew my bike perfectly.  If you are looking for someone that will treat you right, answer the phone, always be respectful and fair, call Mike!  I am bringing it in next week to get it ready for the season.  I will update when he is done!

It happened again!  Mike picked up my bike (filthy as it was) and gave it the "once over" for the season.  He went through it, found a small coolant leak and something with the carb boots (whatever those are) and tuned it up.  Called him to see how it was going and he told me he ws just getting it "dialed in"  He delivered it back to the house and it was cleaner than new, and actually runs better than it ever has.  I was seriously going to sell it and get something else, and now you will never get it away from me!  When he gave me my total, I was honestly concerned that he did not charge me enough.  Need to make sure he stays in business!  A truly honest mechanic.  Who would have guessed they existed?  He even has the coolest cellular credit card machine I have ever seen..  you sign with you finger right on his phone.  If you EVER need someone to work on your bike..  Mike is the guy!  Wish I could give him more than 5 stars.

All I can say is WOW!  My air conditioning started blowing hot air.  Nobody could get out for several days, after all it is July.  Spoke to Brett at 1 pm and offered to be out between 3 and 5 the same day!  He actually beat me to my house by about 10 minutes and waited for me to get home without complaint!  He went and did his thing..  came in and told me he not only fixed the unit that was giving me trouble..  He put 1 pound of Freon into my second unit!  Not only is the one that he came out for running better than it has in a very long time...  My second unit is working even better that it was!  Brett is professional, polite, hard working, and real good at what he does.  As a Realtor, and a trainer, I am always looking for great tradespeople.  Now I FINALLY have an HVAC person that I can reccomend to the 100's of Realtors I work with on a regular basis.  Thank You Kilter Mechanical, and Thank You Brett!
