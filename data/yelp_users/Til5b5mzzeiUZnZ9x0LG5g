Noticed a lot of rude customers today.. Literally pacing back and forth and complaining to each other on the wait. These are also some that came after I did. I was probably in and out within 20-30 min. And I bought one of the higher wash options.  I always come to this location and they always give great service and are really friendly.

Her name is Beth, she is the rudest person in the company!! Don't know how to get my word across, but she helped me numerous of times in one night and she was a rude person that would not direct me to a cab to safely take me home. Therefore I will not ever be using discount cab again in my life. This is why she gets one star! Because she sucks! As well as the overall service.
