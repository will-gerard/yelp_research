Although none the dresses popped out at us and the ones that did were out of our price range, Dedee was very helpful and courteous. I would return here in the future if I needed evening wear and had the budget for it.

The food wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. The five of us each got a different dish so we can have variety. The best was the eggs Benedict. Pumpkin pancakes had too much cinnamon. I got the corned beef hash which was over salted. Definitely prefer the corned beef hash at The Place. They had fresh squeezed orange juice on the menu but when we asked, we were told it was out of the box. I ordered a side of thick cut bacon which turned out to look like regular bacon. We were reassured that it was wider then the other bacon. I don't like this false advertising of menu items. The only saving grace was the mini muffins but I'm not sure if its worth a trip back. Maybe if I happen to be around the area.

My top two Vietnamese food places to go to. The broth is A M A Z I N G as well as the egg rolls. They put taro in the egg rolls which I think gives it more flavor and a different texture. Worth the 20 minute drive from my house.

I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could. The tonkotsu ramen was a bit on the salty side but the gyu don rice was good as usual. The waitress didn't seem to know about their sushi dishes and didn't seem to care to find out.

Looooved the coconut and pineapple cookie! Peanut butter was great as well and the oatmeal raisin was ok. I wasn't too impressed as it tasted like any other oatmeal raisin would. The downside to this place is that their space is small and they don't have any seating inside.

One of my favorite places for Vietnamese food in Arizona. The broth is well seasoned and their egg rolls are tasty. Service is always fast and attentive. They even offered me water while waiting for my take-out one time! The Boba isn't so bad but I wouldn't order it again.

Love this place! They don't have any fancy food on the menu. It's just plain and simple food but done right. Their bacon is amazing as well as their corned beef hash. Although people raved about the biscuits and gravy, I didn't find anything special about them unfortunately.

It's very unfortunate that I have to give this place 2 stars. They say first impressions are the most important. Well, my first impression of Le Chalet wasn't a very good one. We had reservations at 8 on valentines day. We weren't seated until 8:30 which I understand because people especially want to enjoy dinner tonight but the hostess didn't know anything. If we didn't say anything, we would've been waiting longer.   They had a special performance for Valentines day which we opted to see for an additional fee per person. It was a nice show but service seemed to be halted due to it. 80% of the people there already had their meals. It took us 2 hours to have an appetizer (the crepe with scallops), cheese fondue which had an unbelievable amount of butter in and a dessert crepe which was delicious. We originally ordered the "La Potence" but since it took over 45 minutes, we cancelled it. Turns out it was the right choice since the kitchen didn't even prepare it yet.   Can't say I'd ever come back by choice as it seems they need practice for serving a full restaurant. Turns out my scallops weren't prepared properly as I suffered from food poisoning later in the evening. Quite an impression that will last for some time.

Cupcakes were decent but nothing I'd go out of my way for. Cake part was more on the dry side and the icing was crazy sweet. I may return but it will only be to try the macaroons.

Best boba on the west side of Glendale. Always friendly as well. Only constructive criticism I have is their loyalty program. Even if you buy 3 drinks, you only get one punch. If it was one punch per drink, I'm sure more people would return.
