Yeah, not so much. But the balloon animals were fun.

Where's the beef?  Decent decor - although the Muhammed Ali theme was a bit odd - even though the booth seating pleather was starting to crack.  Food had some promise, but the bun on my burger overwhelmed the meat and the other players. And I hate that. If you get a burger, get it w/o the bun. Sweet potato fries were pretty good.   Not the most family friendly place either. Want a good burger? Save yourself a lot of money and just go to Five Guys or In-N-Out.
