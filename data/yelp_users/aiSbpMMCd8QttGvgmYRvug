Not the worst Chinese take-out in the world.  I tend to stick with the Teriyaki Chicken for a quick, serviceable, cheap lunch or dinner option.  Everything else has always been a bit dry or bland.

We've eaten here several times and have never gone wrong with any of the chicken or lamb dishes.  I have not been able to bring myself to try any of the goat dishes yet, but it is on my bucket list.  This time around we had the Madrasi Lamb and Chicken Tikka Marsala which were both delicious.  The Chicken Pakoras were a great start to the meal.  Although they do slightly resemble chicken nuggets, they certainly do not taste processed.  We always enjoy any of their bread selections.  This time around it was Garlic Naan, but again, you can't really go wrong with any of them.  The Golab Jamon dessert--homemade cheese balls made from cream of milk in a scented light syrup--is ridiculous.  Tastes like small puffs of pancake-y heaven.  It is super inexpensive with most dishes in the $10 range.  The service is the best I've ever had.  Everyone is so friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere is open and light.  Unfortunately, it is always a really slow whenever we go.  Hopefully, that only means that we come at the right time.  Everyone should be eating here.
