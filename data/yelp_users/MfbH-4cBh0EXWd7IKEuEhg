What is not to love about Trader Joe's! Customer service is stellar, products are fantastic and this location is very clean! I will say this location is always crazy busy, but generally shoppers and staff alike are very pleasant. The produce here is what keeps me coming back, but i am also a sucker for their little frozen dishes too. My secret love from the frozen department are their Mac'n cheese balls. (SO GOOD!!!) They also have a non-fat vanilla yogurt that i couldn't live without.   I would 100% recommend Trader Joe's, I love this place!

I really like this Target location. It is clean, not horribly busy and it has a very small yet well stocked grocery area. (Frozen food section is pretty decent sized as well.)   I love and hate Target, love it because they have good quality products, hate it because i can never leave empty handed.

As far as banks go, they all seem to be the same inside. The reason this location stood out was the customer service, the staff here are excellent! This Chase location was very clean, employee's are very friendly and they accommodated my banking needs.   Ben Chapman was the personal banker who helped me and he was awesome to work with. He was friendly, knowledgeable about products and I would definitely recommend him any day of the week!    I am a fan of this location for sure.

Awwh SB's, how i love thee and your caffeine. I have been to this location a few times now and i have had excellent service each and every time i have been in (or) gone through the drive-thru. They do have free Wi-Fi inside you are looking for a place to chill.   Recommendations for drinks:  * Black Tea, Green Tea or Passion Tea Lemonades are very refreshing.  (I prefer w/no classic syrup and just add a little raw sugar, but i like these drinks less sweet than most folks.)  * Black Tea Iced plain is really good too. * Cool Lime Refresher is delightful as well. * Chai Tea Latte Iced (sometimes i like it dirty too....... get your mind out of the gutter "dirty" means they add a shot of espresso.)  Recommendations for treats: * Almond Croissant * Blueberry Oat Bar * Reduced-Fat Pumpkin Cream Cheese Loaf Cake * Cheesecake brownie

I am a lover of Chinese food, and am always on the prowl for a tasty new place that is close. This place fit the bill nicely!  Started with the Egg Flower Soup: The flavor was good (it did require a little pepper) and I enjoyed that they added water chestnuts to the soup.  For the Entree I went with the Lemon Chicken: Battered then fried chicken over a bed of cabbage with sweet lemon sauce. The sauce was perfect, YuM! The entree did come with white rice as well.   The server was nice enough, and if you dine in there really isn't much to look at (couple tables & booths.) I suggest just order take-out and eat the delicious food in the comfort of your home.

Pros: - Calm/Quiet atmosphere - Clean - Amenities are good *Hot tub outdoors and inside, large steam room & sauna.  Nice sitting areas both outside and inside.  - Products (Shampoo, conditioner & body wash were okay.)  Cons: - EXPENSIVE! - Beware of the 20%gratuity (i don't know who's idea this was but, i was a little offended at the presumptive 20% tip. I tip well when deserved but i like tipping on my own terms.)  - Spa hostess at the front desk/checking in was snooty - 50 min massages  I went in for Aji (swedish) 50 min massage, the massage therapist was personable and was attentive to what I asked her to focus on. I know the time limit was not her fault but 50 mins for a massage at these prices made me feel really ripped off.  (i had a Groupon to offset the ridiculous cost but even that didn't make me feel better about the cost.) I don't know who thinks a 50 min massage is enough.......but come on an extra 10 mins wouldn't kill them!  All in all i would say skip it, it's expensive and for less money you can get a 60 min or 90 min and feel great because you didn't over pay.

The service at this location was really awesome. It always makes me happy when my beverage is refilled without having to ask. As for the meal, I went with the Avocado Chicken Club sandwich, it was delicious! Instead of the taro chips I substituted the garlic green beans, highly recommended! The meal was very flavorful and reasonably priced.   Give this place a whirl if you are in the area.

This place is consistently delicious & the service really great also. I have tried quite a few items off both the lunch and dinner menu but my favorite thing that I have tried up to this point are the "Stuffed Chicken Medallions." It's chicken breast stuffed with chorizo, poblano peppers and cheese and breaded then fried. Sooo not the healthiest meal but very tasty! If you are going all out, you have to get the "Papas con Chile" (creamy mashed potatoes) they are scrumptious.

I had such a lovely evening, with delicious food and great company. It is super cool that they have vegetarian and gluten free options, I am definitely a fan of that.  The server was extremely personable & very knowledgeable about the menu. I started off with a Key Lime Pie cocktail,  it was really sweet so I wouldn't do more than one or two but definitely worth a try. For the appetizer I did the Gluten-Free Chicken Lettuce Wraps and for my entree the Gluten-Free Lemon Chicken. Both were very delectable and I would definitely recommend both dishes. Unfortunately I was too full to get dessert this time, however if you go just for dessert only or have room for something sweet I would recommend the Banana Spring Rolls.  Side note about this particular location: it is a very busy and the wait times can get a bit ridiculous.  If they accept call ahead seating/reservations I would definitely recommend it, or just go at an odd time of day.

When we moved to AZ naturally I wanted a good Vet for Puddles (my Jack Russell Terrier.) My friend Tina B. told me about Caring Hearts Animal Clinic and had nothing but good things to say about it. So we gave them a try, Puddles has been a patient here for the last three and a half years. Al Schleappe is AWESOME, he is always through and gentle with our little doggie. She is getting up there in age now and she gets a "senior discount" which is pretty cool.   I would recommend this Veterinary Clinic to everyone, they are great!!!

I have been coming to Liberty Market for the past 3 years, and i kick myself for not writing/rating it sooner. I truly do love this restaurant. I have never had a poor experience, the staff is always super friendly, the atmosphere is great and the food is phenomenal! Chef David Traina is awesome and keeps coming up with fresh new options to try that are sensational!  Recommendations for breakfast: Buttermilk Pancakes (add blueberries), Green Chili Pork Scramble and Breakfast Burrito. *Beverages to try: Chai Latte and Mimosa are delightful!  Recommendations for lunch: Cuban, Hollywood Cobb and Best Chicken sandwich are all amazing.   Recommendations for dinner: Starter - Antipasto & Roasted Brie Plate. Entrees - Flatiron Steak, Rustic Creen Chile Pork and their burger's are worth trying as well.   Desserts: One of my all-time favorite desserts you can get here, their ice-cream sandwich is perfection! If you only come here for dessert, you must get it regardless of the time of year. I crave this ice-cream sandwich, it's so yummy!

Weekly Special dessert 1/3-1/4: Baked Alaska - Simply DELECTABLE!!  If you get anything while at Liberty Market this weekend you must try the Baked Alaska. The yummy chocolate cake with the cherry ice-cream and the whipped topping is scrumptious. Well done guys, well done!

REI is Awesome. Yes the prices are a little more spendy than other places you can buy outdoor'ish products. But honestly if you are looking for quality products as well as friendly & knowledgeable staff look no further!   This visit I was sent to pick-up two cots (REI Comfort Cot) that my parents purchased. Wow, these cots are insanely comfortable. I am not a camper really but i would consider going if i could sleep on one of these things while braving the wilderness.   I look at it this way, you get what you pay for. If you want quality products, they come at a premium. This place has beginner to expert equipment and covers hiking to snow gear and everything in between. Because of the wide variety and excellent staff I will keep coming back here for years to come.

Adult Slam Puppet show for 18+ was a surprisingly fun evening. I was a little apprehensive about a "puppet show," i mean i haven't seen one since i was in grade school. The evenings show was funny and full of dirty humor, and i have to say i really enjoyed the laughs. Great value too, $10 if you call and book or $12 at the door.   The venue was an architectural delight, it was an old LDS church that was built in 1929. The high round ceilings and the decorative beams and trim is beautiful. If you go to this building you should definitely take the time to look around and admire it's glory.   Side note: At the adult puppet show they do offer "adult beverages" to those of us that are 21 and older. So grab a beer and come laugh at the naughty puppets.

I love libraries, I love books and I am a big fan of the the Red Mountain Branch of the Mesa Public Library. This place is huge, with lots of places to sit & study, relax and read, as well as private areas for meetings or study groups if needed. This location has everything you could possibly need. The staff was super helpful and friendly.   Go read a book, you might like it!

These guys are FANTASTIC!! Normally I feel yucky & bamboozled after taking my car into any tire store (or) auto repair place. That was completely not the case here, the employee's at this location were great with me. They went over all my options for tires and cost & let me decide what i felt was best for me and my budget. I did not feel pressured or duped at anytime while here.   Like others, I would definitely recommend calling ahead to see the wait time or to set an appointment to go in.

First word that comes to mind when i walked into this joint (hehehe) was "hippy." Its decor was exactly what you would expect seeing how it's name is Cheba Hut. They do make some awesome sandwiches and dessert/treats though. The ingredients taste fresh and i like that the sandwiches are made to order & are toasted too.   Recommendations for sandwiches: (I usually get the "pinner" which is an 8" sandwich.) * White Widow - chicken, mushrooms, bacon and ranch.  * Pac Blue - toasted tuna w/cheddar  Recommendations for treats:  * Golden Grahams mallow treat was pretty freaking great!  If you go, you have to get the Kool-Aid to drink, something about an immediate sugar rush when it hits your lips is delightful. (Nostalgic i guess.)

As far as sandwich places go, this place definitely knows what they are doing! Dilly Bird is so delicious! The turkey is fresh, the focaccia bread is bomb and I love a sandwich that has sprouts (it's an underrated veggie.)  Recommendation:  - Dilly Bird *I normally minus the cream cheese and add cucumber on my sandwich.*  - Gobbler *minus the cream cheese on this one too....i just don't care for it on my sandwiches.* - Potato salad (yum!)  Service is fast & friendly and they do have delivery if you are in there "delivery zone."  FYI: Their sandwich portions are large so if you are not starving try their classic combo which is a 1/2 classic sandwich with soup or salad.

I have been here a couple times and have been meaning to Yelp it.   The first time I came to Monti's was for a work function, it was a set menu: Appetizer's tried - Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Prime Rib Bites and Potato Skins. Entree options were either Spiced Bone-in Chicken Breast or Top Sirloin (I went with the Top Sirloin which was great, cooked perfectly.)   The second time I came to Monti's was on a Living Social deal (2 drinks, 1 appetizer and 2 entree's.) For the appetizer I had to get the Prime Rib Bites as they were my favorite. For the entree I went with the Blackened Chilean Sea Bass and Bri went with the 24 oz. Porterhouse. Loved both!   I would recommend giving this place a try, make sure to ask for the "tour" which gives you a little history of the building (pretty cool.)

Skip it! If i could give no stars (or) negative stars i would.  It's overpriced, and definitely NOT worth the wait.   The food was bad buffet food. It reminded me of the scene from Vegas Vacation when Clark Griswold & Cousin Eddie go to the buffet.   Food had no flavor....i didn't think you could screw up mini waffles but the batter was dry and the strawberry compote (really just strawberries in sugar syrup) didn't help the dryness. I thought maybe the prime rib would be good but it was very fatty and was dry as well. All the vegetables i tried were bendy if raw or mushy if cooked. They just couldn't seem to get anything right. The only thing that was ok were the deli meats & cheeses, but i would hate to pay the full ticket price for a buffet to only eat deli meat.   I had such high hopes since there were so many review and a very high star rating, but i was extremely disappointed.  Please don't waste your hard earned money and time.

I really do love bookstores! I enjoy just taking my time and meandering through each section, looking at everything on display. I hope upon hope that actual paper books never go the way of the dodo, that would make me one unhappy girl!   Changing Hands offers a couple things that i like: they have both new and used books, they do have a reasonably sized children's section, they have a small area of clever gifts and fun things for your home/office and they have an area for lectures, book signings and things of that nature. I think it is pretty cool you can take your used books in and they will give you store credit for them. I have brought in a couple boxes and they definitely gave me a fair prices for the trades. (If for some reason they do not want/do not accept a particular book, you can request what they don't buy to come back to you (or) you can have them donate the books which is what i do.)  Clearly i am a fan and will continue to come back for my books & random fun gift needs.  ~the end~

Seriously MUST try! Anytime I am in Tempe I hit Essence Bakery for a yummy treat or breakfast/lunch.   The macaroons are so delicious, I can never just order one. (If you have never tried a macaroon i would suggest a box of the mini's so you can try 12 flavors to see what you like.) My personal fav is the hazelnut but the raspberry is a close second.   Recommendations for breakfast: Brioche French Toast (add fresh fruit.)  Recommendations for lunch: Quiche Lorraine, Local Power Ranch Beef Hamburger (add dubliner cheddar and avocado) and Organic Spinach and Cranberry salad (add chicken.)  Essence Bakery is a cute little restaurant, if you are in need of a fun place to sit and catch up with a friend or have a sweet tooth attack this is the bakery for you.

This is an awesome dog park.   We have a Jack Russell so we stayed in the small doggie area. Puddles (our dog) had a blast! She ran and played with a variety of little ones. She lasted about two hours and she decided that was enough fun for the day.    Great area for big dogs w/a pond in it. (Most of the owners seem to be responsible today.)   I would highly recommend taking your doggie to Cosmo Dog Park!

I just moved to the Mesa area and was super excited to find out that Venezias is so close! I am a fan of pizza in general, but this place really knocks it out of the park. The crust is phenomenal and the toppings are fresh. They have lots of coupons available and that is how I get the best deals, so make sure you look online and in the mail.   Recommendations:  - Vegetarian Style (Mushrooms, green peppers, onions, black olives and tomatoes.) - Margherita pizza (Mozzarella, fresh basil and sauce.)   - Pepperoni and Olive (Good old stand-by! Their pepperoni's rock!)  If you are looking for a lighter side:  - Garden Salad & Antipasto Salad are my two fav's.   Must order sides:  - Garlic Bread with cheese (Sometimes I just get this and a side garden salad, YUM!)  **FYI: There is a 10" Gluten Free option as well which is awesome!**  I have always received great service at this location, the food is always delicious and the prices are very reasonable (with coupons.) I normally go into the store and pick it up myself or eat there, I have yet to order delivery since I live close and like saving the buck to grab it up myself.

This place is a cool, they have outdoor seating as well as a reasonably large indoor restaurant area. The service was friendly and quick (granted they were not super busy at the time.) The decor is pretty cute, I mean who doesn't love cute doggie pictures!  Recommendations: Cobb Salad - fresh greens, crispy bacon, avocado, boiled eggs, tomatoes with grilled chicken breast. (I opted for no bleu cheese crumbles.) *All the produce was fresh tasting and the chicken was cooked perfectly tender.   Sizzling Fajita Salad - fresh greens, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and salsa topped with sizzling beef and sauteed onions. *If you go with the beef, order the temperature a little under what you normally would because the meat continues to cook when it's served.  I was pleasantly surprised that i liked this place as much as i did. This location is a little hidden but is a good neighborhood bar and grill.

Dr. Perno ROCKS! The staff is super friendly, the prices are fair and they are very upfront about costs for services. I have been coming to see Dr. P since 2010 when i moved to AZ.   A couple months back he fixed a very old silver filling that was done when i was a child. It ended up needing a root canal (which i figured it would.) I have had a root canal before and it was very painful, but here at Comfort Care he was gentle, and it was painless to my surprise!   I 100% recommend Comfort Care Dental and Dr. Perno!  P.S. Janice is my favorite dental hygienist here, ask for her when you call and make an appointment, she is a rockstar too!

Customer service at this location was top notch. Good job guys!  From the second I walked in the door to the check-out counter I was well taken care of. It is really nice to walk into a store and not be hounded by all the sales folks, but when I was unable to find what I needed on my own there was someone there to help me.   This Office Max is like most other office supply store, except the customer service at this location was stellar!

I went on Sunday about 10am and i am pretty sure i only saw a total of 3 other guests. I think i would chalk this up to the outrageous costs for the services.   The facilities: Nicely decorated. The sauna and steam rooms were small and they only have a one person cold & warm plunge pool. (which seemed odd to me.) The whirlpool was decent size but there was only one, which i imagine on a busy day would not be ideal. The showers were ok (the corners looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a while.) The product (shampoo & conditioner) were terrible! They smelt very strong and did not moisturize at all. I felt like i was using the $1.99 product from the supermarket.   The Service: Vincent C was my therapist and he did a great job on the 80 min deep tissue massage. He was attentive and listened to what i asked for, paying close attention to the areas that i specifically requested he work. If this place wasn't so overpriced i would go see him again.   Positives:  - Front desk/attendants were personable - The Service itself was good  Negatives: - Extremely overpriced - Small facilities - Mood music was extremely distracting (No appropriate for a massage, it sounded like house dance music.)  If you hit it big in Vegas i would might hit this place up, but if you are on a budget i would say pass on this spa.

I went into the salon & spa on a living social deal (60 min Massage and brow combo.)  I also added a spa pedi since i was in desperate need and their price was right.   Pleasantly surprised all around!   Massage:  The massage was nice, i asked her to focus on my neck, shoulders, back and legs only. The therapist did exactly as i asked, her "firm" was more of a medium for my taste. Her transitions from each area was very fluid and she was thorough with the areas that needed extra attention.   Brows:  Shaped and cleaned up nicely and i like the products they used.   Pedicure:   The spa pedicure that i opted for was not something i saw on the menu/website however luckily the person next to me was getting it so i chose the upgrade. We will call it the "Whet" pedi. (That was the name of the polish used but not the name of the pedicure opt.) I HIGHLY recommend that option, in addition to quality product they used, you get to keep the brand new nail polish they use in your treatment. (pretty cool!)  White Lotus Salon and Spa's prices are very reasonable, the staff is very nice and accommodating. The space is a little small but i liked the coziness.   It's the little things that make a great spa experience and this establishment has gotten it right! I will definitely be back.

My sister and I went to Dolce Salon & Spa at Borgata this morning. The girls that checked us in were professional. My sister did a 90 min massage, she stated it was sub-par & cost was excessive. I went with the spa pedicure w/gel polish, the polish is pretty and i know it will last a long time but the disappointment was in the massage (or lack thereof.) When i go get a pedicure i expect a decent massage, especially when you are paying these prices......i had high hopes but they just didn't deliver.   Positives:  - Service professionals were personable - The services themselves okay  Negatives: - Costly - One of the best parts of getting a pedicure (the massage) was absent from this service.  - No amenities (steam or sauna.)  Reasoning for 2 Stars is i have definitely experienced better.

This place was a happy surprise. Not a lot of seating, but the food and service is great.   Started with the fried wontons (they were delicious with ground chicken in them.) Entree I had the Lad Na (flat noodles pan fried with brown gravy with chicken, broccoli and carrots.) The gravy was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I also tried the Thai iced tea which Brian recommended, tasted good but was not really my thing.    All in all a really tasty Thai place!

I love restaurant week! A bunch of friends and I decided to get together for our birthday month (May!) This was a perfect place to do so! The service was good, the restaurant itself is par for the course as this is a chain restaurant (it is clean and low lighting as a steakhouse should be.) As for the meal......  I did the "Phoenix Restaurant Week Special" which was a three course meal for $30. (Steal of a deal!)   First Course: Wedge salad - lettuce wedge topped with bacon, tomatoes and ranch dressing. (fresh veggies and creamy dressing = a delectable salad.)   Second Course: The Keg Oscar - 8oz sirloin steak topped with shrimp, scallops, asparagus and Bearnaise sauce. (steak was perfectly cooked, the Bearnaise sauce with shrimp and scallops was okay. I would have preferred crab instead of shrimp & scallops but that's just me.) The entree came with a "side" which i picked the Twice Baked Potato, it was creamy mashed potato stuffed back into a half shell and baked again which quite delicious!  Third Course: Butter Tart -  Meh, not my favorite dessert but I like that the portion was small and that I was able to try something new i typically wouldn't order. It just didn't have a whole lot of flavor happening, just a boring sweet treat.   On other visits to The Keg I have had: * Mushrooms Neptune (mushrooms topped with crab and cream cheese.) a fav of mine! * Keg Caesar - typical romaine salad with the Keg's version of dressing (good but go with the wedge if you are going to get a salad here.)  * Filet Classic - filet steak wrapped in bacon * Prime Rib - pretty self-explanatory   * King Crab - a pound of steamed king crab legs. (So good & one of my fav's!)  This place can get a little spendy if your not careful. You may want to check out their happy hour menu (4pm to 7pm: M-F) you can try the Mushrooms Neptune for $4, the  loaded nachos for $6 and the Prime Rib Sliders for $8.

The service was spot on, it is a chain so there are locations all over. I do like the San Tan location because it's close and i have always gotten great service here.   My recommendations:  - Lobster Bisque: It's warm, creamy deliciousness.  - Bistecca Insalata: their version of a wedge salad, with gorgonzola, bacon, roma tomatoes and creamy parmesan dressing (so scrumptious!) - Brio Chopped Salad: chopped greens, cucumbers, onions, olives, tomatoes, feta and red wine vinaigrette.  - Veal Milanese: veal scaloppine with white wine lemon caper sauce (the caper sauce is amazing!) It also comes with fettuccine alfredo too.   They do offer a couple gluten free pastas which is nice! The only thing that i am not in love with here are their desserts. We all know i have a sweet tooth but i haven't found anything here that has blown my socks off.   P.S. The Brunch here is fabulous. (Sat & Sun until 3:30pm) My two fav's are the Open Faced Chicken & Avocado Omelet and the Berries & Cream French Toast.

Let me preface this with the following: I realized ordering fish might be a risk at an establishment such as this, but the girl at the counter was raving about it so i thought i would give it a try. ~What a mistake!~ I took my meal to go, or I would have 100% talked to a manager about this experience.  The service was semi-friendly, it was late lunch time and they were busy but not crazy busy. I opted for the Salmon Caesar Salad (recommendation from the employee.) The salad consisted romaine lettuce (which was not "crispy" like noted on the menu,) capers, grated parmesan cheese, croutons (soggy) and caesar dressing (dressing was a decent flavor.) On top of the salad was the "Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet" which was super dry, had absolutely no seasoning and had a mild hint of freezer burn taste. It clearly was an older piece of fish that had been in the freezer for far to long. It was totally my fault for expecting far better but they definitely should have tossed that chunk of meat out long ago. On the brighter side, the bread served with the salad was really good & the iced tea was enjoyable too.   Safe to say, stick to the bakery items (sandwiches & baked goods.) Definitely DO NOT ORDER THE "Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet Caesar Salad." Yuck!

When I worked over in this area, I frequented Cafe Roma often. The service is always friendly, the food is spot on and the restaurant is clean.   Recommendations:  - Breakfast:     French Toast Special (2 french toast, 2 bacon & 2 eggs)     Breakfast Burrito (eggs, cheese, potatoes and bacon is my fav.) - Lunch:     Grilled Chicken, bacon & avocado sandwich is *AWESOME!*    Philly Steak salad is good (add avocado too it to make it even better)    Meatballs and Garlic Knots (both are sides but sometimes a couple meatballs and a couple knots for dipping is a great meal.)   The pizza is good too, but honestly the items listed above are what i got 90% of the time. Give them a try if you are in the area.

What a great place! I called on a Sunday morning hoping they had availability and they fit me right in. Candice did an OUTSTANDING job. I had a 90 min deep tissue massage that was sheer bliss. Her technique was great, pressure was perfect (when I asked for firm pressure she wasn't afraid to use the more.)  Their prices are extremely reasonable and the spa is very clean. I loved that I wasn't charged extra for aroma therapy. Spa is on the small side and they do not have steam or sauna facilities like some of the bigger spas. For the price and atmosphere they provide it is well worth every penny.   I will definitely be going back!

I just became a member a couple weeks ago, i researched the heck out of fitness centers in my area. Mountainside is by far the cleanest of the bunch. Their cardio equipment is great, if there is a broken machine it gets repaired quickly. The weights area has machines that are perfect for the novice like myself.   The staff is very nice and helpful if needed, but they are not pushy like other places i have been to.   Needless to say i am very happy with my choice to become a member.   *Perk - covered parking  *Zumba classes are included in the membership and they are AWESOME!

Really great burgers! I love that I am able to get a burger "protein style" (which just means no bun/but wrapped in lettuce.) The lettuce is always crisp and fresh, the burger is cooked to perfectly and I am a fan of their "special sauce" which is 1000 Island'ish sauce. So good! Sometimes simple is best, and they so burgers right. Their fries are equally tasty, though I like to get mine well-done so they are extra crispy. *Side note: If you like their sauce, try the fries "Animal Style" it is pretty awesome!  All in all: great staff, great burgers & fries and clean restaurant.   Minor down fall is sometimes their lines (both indoor & drive-thru) get crazy busy. So you may have to patiently wait for your meal.

Seriously who doesn't love Costco! You can never leave without spending at lease $100, but it's always a fun trip. I am always amazed at the large product section, I have never been disappointed in my fruits/veggie purchases. (I am slightly addicted to the red seedless grapes, YUMMY!) I like the sampling too, it's always nice to know you are going to like a product you are purchasing in large quantities.   I really like this location, the staff is very friendly and helpful. It's very rare there isn't tons of folks shopping so be prepared to stand in line when you check-out.

Going to get your eyes checked every year isn't the most glamorous of appointments. But thanks to the friendly folks at Sonoran Desert Eye Center they make each visit awesome. I have been a client for the last 2yrs and will continue to go here for many years to come.   The office is very clean and the office staff is super helpful.

WING NIGHT ~ Wahoo!!!   I did not used to be much of a wing fan, however that has changed over the last couple years. Now I very much enjoy good wings. Native New Yorker has a great Salt and Pepper dry rub that I am obsessed with. The wings are good sized, crispy, flavorful and not greasy (or) to messy. There is a hint of garlic on the Salt and Pepper wings that makes them just that much better. If you go for Tuesday night .35 cent wings just be prepared to wait for a table, it gets a little crazy trying to find a place to sit. But for the price and the quality it is worth it!   (Their Medium sauce is good, it has a little kick but it does not burn your mouth. So if you like sauce on your wings but don't like to sweat then go with the medium.)

Price was okay - $40 (including $5 for tip) for a full set w/cuticle trim.  The customer service was horrible, the girl that did my nails did not say much at all. She acted like she was in a rush the entire time yet there wasn't anyone waiting (only two other  customers in the shop.)  I would not go back, i have had better.

When the weather here in AZ dipped, I thought something warm would be nice. Naturally ramen sounded like it would do the trick, so i gave this place a chance.   I ordered the Sapporo Ramen (Sweet Butter corn in miso flavored broth) with original toppings & beef. The veggies were all good except for the carrots which were past their prime. While the soup was warm and flavor was so so, i just wasn't blown away by anything. The staff was not very pleasant and seemed annoyed by all my questions with their menu.   This place is just okay, nothing really special or unique about it.

WOW! I Love this place. The naranja is my favorite flavor although the pura pina is a close second. Fresh ingredients make all the difference in the world.   This is a great frozen dessert if you are looking for something sweet and refreshing. You won't be disappointed with these popsicles.   YUMMY!!

I am a lover of cupcakes, i was SO disappointed in this place.   The three flavors i tried:  Key Lime Pumpkin Spice Salted Caramel   Pros: - Cupcake size was very large - Pumpkin Spice frosting was okay  Cons: - Dry cake (on all the cupcakes i tried) - Key Lime frosting was runny and the cake flavor was bland - Salted Caramel frosting was waxy in texture and the cake was forgettable - Pumpkin Spice cake tasted as if the spices were missing   Paying these prices for cupcakes ($12 for 3 cupcakes *including taxes) i expected much more. Needless to say I was not impressed. I would sooner spend my money on a Betty Crocker box mix & frosting than eat these cupcakes again.

I LOVE the produce here. Such a large selection of beautiful fruits and veggies. The pretty colors and smell of freshness makes me happy!   Not only do they have great produce, but they also have a wide variety of gluten free and natural products. Their hormone free sliced chicken (lunch meat) is yummy. Their deli meats and cheeses are great, their pre-made meals are pretty good and I happen to like purchasing specific pieces of meat from the butcher counter.   Their prices are reasonable, yes of course you are going to pay a little more for GF or Organic but they have so many more options than the regular grocery stores. Not to mention their bulk bin options too, where you can get anything from granola to chocolate covered almonds.   Such a fun adventure every time i go shopping here!

When i lived in Chandler this was one of the places that delivered to the house. I like that they had a delivery option, though as with most food....dining in is almost always better.   Geno's makes a mean Chicken Cheddar Ranch sub and a rockin Provolone Philly. The Cranberry Pecan salad is tasty also if you are looking for something a little lighter (or bread-less.) In addition to the subs the fries are pretty delicious, i enjoy the Bacon Ranch Fries (do not try to get these delivered as they don't travel very well, they get a little soggy.)  The customer service is decent, the delivery times are a little long on the weekends (like most places.)

If i could give negative stars i would. I had the worst experience EVER at a car wash this morning. I was pretty excited to do something special for my brothers birthday, i was trying to surprise him by taking his car in the morning to get it washed and vacuumed. When I got to Danny's the sales guy talked me into a fully interior detail job. It was a little expensive ($99) but the car really did need a good once over so i went with it. I specifically asked him how long it would take, to which he replied an hour to an hour & a half. This is where it all went wrong..........I was stuck in that stupid lobby for over 3.5 hrs. When I went to check on the status at the 2.5 hour mark, the girl at the register didn't care what I had to say. She interrupted me by explaining that I had misheard the gentleman in the beginning, and that no one would tell me it would be that quick. (NO i didn't misunderstand anything in the beginning, I asked because I also had to work today and needed it done quickly.)   The wash was just a typical wash job, nothing bad or good about it. The interior was vacuumed and the dash was wiped, although I did have to ask the guy to do the windows again because I am pretty sure they missed them all together the 1st time.  It took forever, and they had MORE than plenty of time to get everything done - then again, maybe not.   Customer service was horrible, management did nothing to fix my frustration while I was there. I am officially bugged that I gave them another chance - last time took longer than they said as well.  Which means, I'm done with Danny's.

I was looking for a place for an eyebrow & full arm wax so I thought I would give this place a try.   While the facility was clean and the girl at the front was friendly I was sadly not impressed with the end result.  The price was ok for a full arm and brow it was $30 (Brow was free since this was my first time using them.)   The service itself.....that was the disappointing part. I have had my fair share of waxing, and I am NOT a fan of their wax. It only took off the hairs to the skin. (Results were exactly like I shaved my arms not waxed them.) The girl who waxed me was irritated at me when I asked her to go back and get spots she missed the first time (that was off-putting.)   I did not find this hair removal method to be effective at all.   In short I would not return.

Yeah, I could eat breakfast every day here! I love breakfast foods and this place knocked it outta the park for me on multiple visits.   Things I've tried:  *Bananas Foster French Toast: thick slices of french toast with banana caramelly goodness all over them. ((MY FAVORITE!))  *Waffles: the batter is fantastic, the strawberries were fresh and the whip cream topped it perfectly. (no syrup needed for these delicious waffles!)  *The Pear: this is an omelet with bosc pear, havarti cheese, almond slices and bacon. (You may be thinking, as I did.....pear, eggs and cheese? Don't miss out on this combo, it's outstanding!)  They do offer GF options too if you need/prefer. I have yet to try their lunch items because of all the breakfast options. I hear that the Smokehouse Avocado Stack is a must try item! No doubt, I will be back in very soon. Prices are great, happy employee's but the service is a little slow. I attribute the slow service to the fact every time I am in this restaurant it is crazy busy, so just be prepared to wait a little bit. You won't be disappointed once you have your meal though, I think it is worth the wait!

Honestly is there anything better than going to get your hair done? It always makes me feel like a new person, i love it!  This place is awesome. Alycia is the best. She is up on all the styles and trend for cuts and colors. This salon is fun, i enjoy sitting and talking with the girls while i get my hair done.

Really like this place! The cheese burgers are tasty, custard (concrete's) are awesome and their french fries w/fry sauce **yes i said fry sauce** are DELICIOUS!   Food - 4 stars Service - 5 stars Desserts - 4 stars  If you are in the area and are looking for a quick yummy burger than go no further.   (Tis the season for Pumpkin Pie......Freddy's has an out of this world Pumpkin Pie Concrete that i would highly recommend.)

What a fun experience! I highly recommend this as a girls-night-out (or) as a date night activity.   My mom was visiting from out of town and I was looking for something original that we could do together that was a little on the crafty side. I had heard buzz about The Brush Bar from a couple friends at work earlier this year and recalled them saying what fun it was. So, I figured....why not give it a go!   When we arrived, the hostess gave us the run down of how it all worked, since we were a little early we grabbed a drink and a cookie and sat to chat. Once everyone had arrived we started class, it is very non-formal which is great because painting should be fun. The instructor was charismatic and was great to explain things to basic level without making you feel like dumb-dumb. The option was given at the start to paint/follow along with the painting of the evening or do your own thing. Even though everyone pretty much painted the peacock (since that was the class we signed up for) it was interesting to see all the different ways people saw & painted the picture.   I was pleasantly surprised at how fun and easy they made this experience. My painting was no Picasso so I won't be leaving my day job, but I would definitely recommend the experience to any level of painter.    Go enjoy a drink or two and paint with friends, you really will have a great time!

What a cool shop. I am fascinated by rocks, fossils, gems and minerals, this place was so much fun to wander through.   Fred (owner) was happy to share his knowledge of the stones, answered questions and even demonstrated how he uses his saw blade to manipulate stone shaping. It is fantastic to see a proprietor with that much zeal doing what he loves and being successful with it. Bravo! This place laid out well, I wasn't expecting such organization. The larger rock items were mostly outside and the smaller items (tumbled rocks, more precious varieties and smaller man made products were indoors.)   My parents have taken a couple cabochon classes and wire wrapping classes, so I brought them to the shop yesterday to look around...it was like taking two kids to a candy store.   The prices are more than fair and they are very helpful & knowledgeable with the merchandise.  If you like rocks, are a jewelery designer in need of material or need a stone for decoration you definitely need to stop in here!

Anytime I am craving good Mexican food I head to Casa Ramos. Yelp reviews got me in the door but the food has kept me coming back and recommending this place to anyone who will listen to me.   The staff is super friendly, the ambiance is great and the food........i can't even begin to tell you how delicious it truly is. You must try it for yourself.   Recommendations: Pollo a la Crema, Chile Relleno and Pork Enchilada's. (Honestly, I don't know if you could go wrong with anything on their menu.)

Love this place! Today's visit was the second time i have been here. WOW!   Appetizer: Guacamole ****MY FAVORITE GUACAMOLE EVER!**** Taco's: Barrio Pollo & Chorizo taco was amazing, Arrachera con Relleno was great and the Carnitas taco was good.   Service was great, food was extremely tasty and i will definitely be going back.   (Side note: They have outdoor seating and are dog friendly.)

I love wings & this place sure does it up right! Called in 20 mins before they closed for a 60 wing to-go order. Picked up order 5 mins before closing and everything was done perfectly. The woman was friendly when she answered and was happy to take my order.  Wings: Go with the ATL style (dry rub.) Savory, delectable and excellent seasoning.  Sides: Mac & Cheese bites - crispy on the outside and rich cheesy yumminess! Fried Okra is awesome too (If you get this, eat it there it doesn't travel very well.)   Dessert: Honey Biscuits - just give them a try, they may not sound like much but they are really good.  FYI: On orders large orders you will have to pay with a CC over the phone so be aware they will require that. I would also go with the take-out order method as they are always crazy busy.

Certainly not the worst cupcake i have had, but far from the best.   Flavor's tried: - Raspberry Chocolate    The chocolate, chocolate chip cupcake was moist but was light on the chocolate flavor. The raspberry buttercream was NOT good,  i would venture to say it ruined the cupcake. It was waxy and flavorless.   - Raspberry Cream cheese    The raspberry cake was moist but again lacking flavor. The cream cheese frosting was like eating a gob of cream cheese mixed with sugar. (Blech!)  The store front and decor is cute.  I suppose it's possible that they have another frosting that is better than the two types i tried. Either way, I don't know that I will be back.

I purchased a groupon for underarm hair removal and I was super excited to have this treatment done. Needless to say my results from the year and a few months treatment were not as advertised.   I am a white female, my hair is not super coarse but is fairly dark. At my first consultation it was explained that I had ideal skin/hair for very minimal re-growth after completing the course of laser treatments. Now about a year or so after completion of laser treatments, I find myself having to shave like before. I did my research before getting this treatment done, and I went in knowing that results may vary. The disappointing part comes from paying a lot of money for treatments and being told that I was a candidate for "optimum results." I also expected not to have much hair growth after the visits as that was what I was advised would happen.   Not the case!    I would not recommend Simplicity for a couple reasons: giving unrealistic result expectations from jump street, constantly moving locations and not telling me they moved so I would show up at my appointment only to find they were no longer at that local and the laser technicians & front desk staff had very snooty attitudes. Oh, did I mention I was constantly being hard sold to upgrade and spend more money on additional areas to treat. I get trying to up-sale customers, I was in sales so I understand it's purpose. But if I say no once, or even twice...don't keep coming after me to spend more money. If I was satisfied with your services, I would have dropped more cash, I was not satisfied nor impressed......no means no!  I am just grateful that i did not pay full price for their services.

I love trying new places, and was excited to give this restaurant a chance. My experience left me disappointed.   Appetizer: Artichoke Dip ($9) - unfortunately had no flavor.....it was in desperate need of seasoning! Not 100% sure but we think the salsa was jar/canned, if it was made in house, it sure did not taste fresh.   Salad: Wedge Salad ($5.50) - flavor was good, vegetables were fresh and crisp.  Entree: Center Cut Filet ($38) - ordered medium but sadly come out as well-done.   The wait staff was pretty much ignored us for the entire evening. The delay after being seated to when our order was taken was about 15 mins (in that time no one even asked us if we wanted to order drinks.) The time after our order was taken to when the food was actually delivered was ridiculous as well. I don't mind waiting in restaurants and i do enjoy conversation at the table but drinks and checking back with the table as a waiter would have been nice. I wanted to send the filet back but after waiting a while for someone (anyone) to look at us or walk by our table I gave up and ate the overcooked meat because i was ravenous. Honestly our table was not the waiter's priority, there was a large party that he and 3 other wait staff were doting on. I seriously dislike being passed over because a larger party could possibly mean a larger tip. Lame!  It makes me sad when the best thing at a steakhouse is the wedge salad. (If you come here, that is the only thing i am able to recommend.)  Service: 1 Star Food: 2 Stars

I was given a second chance to try CHoP in Chandler and last nights experience was completely different than my first.   Let's start with the staff, last night (a week day evening so the restaurant was busy but not overly crowded) they all were on their game. Our glasses were constantly being refilled, plates were taken away at the appropriate times and the table was checked on often to make sure things were coming out to our liking.   Appetizer: Downtown Fries ($9) - the fries were cooked well, not soggy or overdone. They were seasoned properly and the spicy aioli that come with the fries was great.   Entree: Barbecue Baby Back Ribs ($24) - it has been a while since I have had good ribs. These were fall off the bone delicious! The barbecue sauce was sweet and had a little bit, the meat was tender and not fatty like some ribs can be. I would order these again and recommend them too!   Dessert: Pecan Torte ($7) - the pecans were crispy and the combo with the vanilla ice cream and the butterscotch sauce tied this little dessert together. A tasty little dessert to share as it is rich.   Everything I had last night was on par, the service was up to snuff like a steakhouse should be. Bravo to the staff, chef's and management who made last night a lovely dinning experience.

If you are looking for an excellent Scandinavian/Polish place, look no further! (They even have a dash of Canadian influence as well.) I am a sucker for Schnitzel and the Pork Jagar Schnitzel is my favorite (pork pounded then breaded & cooked topped with brown mushroom gravy when served.) Seriously AMAZING, my description does not even come close to explaining the wonderful flavor explosion that this dish is! The portions for dinner are large, plus with your dish you also get to choose 4 side dishes total. I like the Creamy dill potatoes, Potato salad, Homemade coleslaw and Pickled beets. For the Canadians out there they serve Quebec Poutine (I recommend the large for the table to share as an appetizer.) They also have hand made Pierogies (yum!) All in all i have not been disappointed in anything i have ordered here. I love the new location (much larger and nicely decorated.) The staff is super friendly, even when they are busy they are very courteous and attentive.  P.S. They do have Gluten-Free options.

Oh my Goodness, so amazing!  Breakfast foods are some of my top favorite items to eat. The griddlecakes with sweet cream butter and real (Yes i said "REAL") maple syrup. Seriously these griddlecakes melt in your mouth. The thick-cut bacon was crispy and delicious and i dream about the breakfast potatoes with rosemary.   If you are in the area, or even if you are not.....you definitely should stop at Matt's Big Breakfast!  P.S. I hear the breakfast rush wait time can get a little crazy, I didn't wait in any line however I went around 1pm.

Definitely like this credit union. The tellers are always smiling & helpful and wait time even on a payday or Friday is pretty quick. I do like that this location is open until 7pm which is great for folks that work.   If you are in need of a bank/credit union you should give this place a chance.

This post office looks like many of the others inside & out, the thing that makes this location amazing is their staff. Bravo guys! All the window clerks here know what they are doing, the line moved very fast. Shocker - they all seemed genuinely happy to be at work. When it was my turn in line, the lady that helped me was very knowledgeable and even offered me a couple tips to save $money$ on postage/shipping cost.   I am pleasantly surprised i had such an enjoyable trip to the USPS, I will definitely be back to this location!

This place is so cute! I dig that their menu is unique and they own it! It was just full of things that I would not think to combine, yet they taste and worked well together.   I tried the Chick Pea Pancakes: chick pea, olive oil pancakes topped with bananas and pecans served w/agave syrup (very very sweet but tasty!) The pancakes definitely needed the agave syrup as they would have been dry without it but the flavor of the total pancake package was delicious!   Cookie with Yelp check-in was awesome, I got the nutter-butter type cookie (i am not sure if that was the actual name.) It was a recommendation, I typically don't go for peanut butter type cookies but this one is a winner!  I also tasted the "Devil's Mess" which was eggs, spinach, chorizo, chiles and onions...for those of us that are pansies when it comes to spice you may want to stay away from this item, it was pretty spicy per my taste buds.   Cool market cafe scene, interesting people watching and great food. I like this place, and am definitely a fan!

Talk about AMAZING, this place knocked my socks off!   The Phoenix location is not a very big restaurant but it has HUGE character. I sat outside because it was a lovely evening and a little quieter too. The service was excellent, our glasses did not go dry and our plates promptly cleared when finished. The waitress was on the ball and did not leave us for to long but let us alone enough to enjoy our evening.    I started the meal with the Romana Insalate which was romaine lettuce with Pomo's home dressing and shaved parmigiano cheese. The salad was fresh, the dressing superb and the shaved cheese topped it off nicely. The portion is large enough to share with another.   For the main dish I had the Bufala Verace which was a step up from the normal margherita style pizza. It had the freshest sauce and imported bufala mozzarella that was so creamy it just melted in my mouth. Topped with fresh basil too, seriously this pizza was something to write home about. WoW does not even come close to the awesomeness that danced on my tongue!  Dessert was molto perfetto!! The tiramisu is worth getting, the portion is gigantic and is definitely a share with your friends dessert. It was light and sweet and the berries on the side added to the perfect mix with the coffee and chocolate flavors.  The owner is such a sweet man, at the end of our meal he offered some of his homemade limoncello. It was a sweet, creamy lemon mixture with a hint of vanilla (i think.) He should really put this amazing stuff over vanilla bean ice-cream and berries, it would make a great dessert.     This evenings meal could not have been any better. I wholeheartedly recommend trying this place, you will not be disappointed!

I love the fact this place is open 24 /7. Just went through the drive thru this evening ended up getting 18 donuts, yeah I know that's ridiculous but I had a coupon for buy a dozen & get 6 free. I ended up getting an assortment, but they do have my favorites which are the French cruller. I find it amazing that they have a wide variety of donut options even at 9 o'clock at night. I'm sure Homer Simpson would be proud of my purchase this evening. Donut drive thru = awesome in my book!

I was a little worried when I laid down to relax for the massage and Kenny G was blasting "White Christmas." But my fear was quickly erased once the massage started. I opted for the 60 min for $30 which I think is a steal of a deal, I would have gone for the 90 mins for $45 but they didn't have any availability for that when i walked in. The pressure was great, the gentleman that worked on me really worked out the area's that had knots and i walked out of there super relaxed.   The place is clean, the staff was very friendly and the hours are great too. (They are open 7 days a week from 10am to 10pm.)   I definitly recommend indulging a little and go get your self a foot massage, great value for your dollar at YoYo Foot Massage!

1 Star for service 3 Stars for the food *Averages to a 2 Star experience at this location because, Meh...I've experienced better.*  Let me preface this review by saying....I have had better experiences at other Kneaders Bakery locations (in Utah.) I am hoping it was just an "off" day or something?  Oh my goodness the drive through was so slow, and the customer service by both the girl who took my order & the one at window was horrible. Not sure if window girl was just flustered due to being busy or maybe having a bad day but yikes. She was not pleasant or personable. She snatched my credit card from my hand with attitude and tossed my food at me through my car window after i paid.   Recommendations for food:  - Turkey Bacon Avocado Salad w/ranch (or) Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia (same as the salad but on bread.) The turkey is roasted and pulled/shredded which is delightful and the bacon is crispy. - Turkey Cranberry Sunflower Salad. The poppy seed dressing is scrumptious. - Cinnamon French Toast for breakfast is awesome, if you dine-in it's all you can eat. It's served with fresh strawberries and a caramel syrup that makes you want to lick the plate when you are finished.   I sure hope this location gets their house in order, if their customer service is made a priority then maybe their rating would come up. Go for the food, not the service!

Kona 13 definitely knows what's what in the coffee world!   My brother recommended we stop for a drink after breakfast, I was a little skeptical about giving this place a try but I am very glad we stopped.    I had a sip of just plain black coffee and the flavor was fantastic (hot but fantastic!) I also sampled the caramel macchiato which was better than any other version of this drink i have had.   If in the area, this is the place to get your coffee!

CHOCOLATE CAKE SHAKE - Wowza!   I really dig this place. I am amazed every time that I go in this restaurant, it runs like a well oiled machine. The employee's at the registers are very knowledgeable about the menu, the staff when you go to pick up your food all seemed like they really enjoyed and wanted to be at work. It's just an over all happy environment (even when they are extremely busy.)   Recommendations:   First off - you must, and I mean MUST get the Chocolate Cake Shake! If you can't tell I am a BiG fan!  - Chopped Salad is delightful, consists of chopped lettuce and small pasta noodles with chicken, bacon, cabbage, tomatoes and house dressing. (It also comes with onion and gorgonzola cheese which I had taken off.) The salad also comes with one of their (spectacular) warm lemon poppy seed muffins.    - Grilled Tuna Sandwich, tuna w/lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. (You must love tuna to enjoy this sandwich.)   -Big Beef, be prepared as this is a very large sandwich. It's Italian beef on french bread. The beef is well flavored and if you add cheddar cheese or mozzarella to the sandwich it is out of this world.   - Onion rings: They are not to thick or thin and they are not over-battered like most onion rings are. They are light, crispy and awesome!  I have yet to try the hot dogs, I plan to on my next Portillo's adventure. Hope you stop in and enjoy this place as much as I do.   --One last time.....get the cake shake!--
