I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.

Oh my goodness,  I love this place, but must admit that it can be frustrating trying to get a seat.  It is well worth the wait.  A favorite thing for me is that you get a chance to try some awesome wines, and if you like you can buy a bottle or two while you are there.

We use pressure washers to clean out our screens.  We had one go down and were pretty desperate for the part.  Fortunately Superior Cleaning had it and since they are so easy to get to we were up and running in less than an hour.  What made it really great for us is that they saw our guy sitting out waiting for them to open and they opened up early, took care of him, and he was back in no time.  Lots of people will say "sorry we don't open until 7:30, just wait until then".   Nope, they were awesome, opened up and sent him on his way.  Thanks, you have gained a customer for life

I got referred there today and met Dr. Pogue and his team for the first time.  Extraordinarily professional both he and his staff.    I also really appreciated how quickly they were able to schedule the appointment.  Thanks Pogue Team!

Went for our anniversary and it was perfect.   They always make you feel important even as you look around and see everyone from rock stars to people like us.  The place is perfect for a romantic dinner or a celebratory meal.   I had the Peppered Steak and my wife had the Pan Roasted Chicken.  Her salad was exactly how she enjoys it, and the deserts were delicious. I appreciate that the impressive wine list isn't overpriced at all but quite reasonable compared to other places of this caliber.   I can assure you we will be back to Tarbell's for another special occasion soon.   (we might just have to create one, so we can go again sooner rather than later)

This is a tough review to write.  I have always enjoyed this place and usually take clients there a few times a year.  Last night I took my wife and 4 other guests and it was not the usual great experience.  My bone in ribeye frankly wasn't all that great.  It had very little flavor, but that wasn't the biggest issue.  Our table of 6 was seated right next to another table of 6 and other than the people right next to you, you couldn't hear the other 3 people at the table.  The music was loud, which didn't help either.  Having just been at Del Frisco's twice in Vegas the difference between the two places was striking.  All in all I believe everyone had a nice time, but for the money spent, and as the one paying the bill it was not worth it.   Unfortunately I will be looking for a different steak house for our next client dinner.

Bought a new refrig for my 94 year old mom.  Had a bad seal on it and a crack that she noticed and even though under warranty they are making this way more complicated than it needs to be.  I cannot in good faith recommend them to anyone.   I should have bought from Costco or All State Appliances.

I left the review above on Sunday and I am happy to say that on Monday morning I had a message from someone at Spencer's. They replaced the refrigerator yesterday and all is well. I appreciate the prompt attention once I yelped, I just wish I hadn't had to post that I was unhappy to get the service I had expected.  I truly do appreciate the fact that Spencers did the right thing.

Loved the happy hour!  The wines by the glass were reasonably priced, we ordered two pizzas.  I wasn't crazy about the crust they use but that is just because it was different than what I was hoping/expecting.    Damien was our waiter and he was perfect.  Not hovering but never ignoring either.  In addition to loving the happy hour prices their homemade bread was to die for.  I could go there just for that!

This guy is impressive.  I went in for some x-rays and other minor work and he pointed out some issues with my teeth that he wants me to take care of.  He recommended me to another Dr. for a separate issue and it was interesting how much respect the other Dr. had for Dr. K. He is clearly a leader in his field and I now understand why when you ask around, his name is recommended repeatedly.  Thanks Dr. K.

No question, this is our favorite place in town.  The pizza tastes just like you would get in Italy and many of the staff seem to be Italian.  I love the Don Alfonso, my wife loves the Margherita.  I would eat there every night if I could. Yes we have been to Oregano's (too long of a wait, and a completely different style of pizza)

First time there.  It was a Sunday night so the wine was 1/2 off which made us very happy.  Food was excellent.  Had the pad thai and a shrimp and scallops dish.    My only complaint is that it was really hot seated near the window as the sun was going down.  We didn't linger as a result.

I cannot say enough good things about Firebird Pinball. They did an awesome job. Came to our home fixed my Addams family and it works flawlessly. I can only tell you that if you have a pinball that does not work you must try them because they are excellent.

Read all the other reviews and decided since it was close to home we would try it. Walking in and seeing it packed was certainly a good sign.  We were seated shortly after arriving and frankly it was a great place to have dinner.  We had two of the ceviches which were both delicious.  I had the carne asada  and the shrimp tacos which were also delicious.    My wife had the kale salad which was different than any other kale salad she had ever ordered.  The good news is that it tasted great and she was quite pleased.   The food was prepared quickly, the server was lovely and quite helpful with suggestions.   We will be back soon.

Had an emergency when an old cap came off.  I called the office and followed instructions on how to get ahold of someone.  Dr. Leila called me back and was able to fit me in this morning.  I am so grateful.  I have a new crown that they made while I waited, Dr and her staff were all very nice and I will be coming back for any new work I need done.

Stopped in to meet a friend.  I had never been there before but loved the cool vibe.  Food was fantastic.  I was too early to try one of their 10,000 different tequilas (ok 10K may be an exaggeration) but will return.   I can see why so many of my friends who live in central Phx rave about it.   I will be back!
