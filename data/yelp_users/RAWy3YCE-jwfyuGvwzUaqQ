I have only been to Wild Thaiger a few times and have eaten food they catered for a private buffet dinner at the restaurant most of those times. The Pad Thai is a favorite of mine. I love their Iced Thai Tea. The atmosphere is nice, the service is top notch and the food is constantly good. They also have a full bar with happy hour.

Well for starters, I will say I had given up on going out for dinner so I ate a couple slices of warmed over pizza. We finally went and as I was less than hungry skipped the steak I had been eying. We split a Meatloaf and switched the mashed potatoes out for the mashed sweet potatoes. The two split plates were more than enough food for a regular meal. I can't imagine eating a whole one and I am a hearty eater. We also each ordered a Rico Rita. Yummy and again large portions. The service was good too. I used to go to the Camelback location and the quality and service is the same here. We will be back.

Was my first time eating at Rito's. I knew that I wanted the Chimi-Enchilada Style. My friend suggested I do the Red. I have no idea what the difference is. We ordered a side of rice and my friend suggested to pour the rice in the container over the sauce. It was very delicious. I am all for dives but this place was not the best set-up for eating in so we took the food to a park and ate it. The crowd is a nice mostly working class lot's of utility type workers. They only take cash and the drinks are canned but cold. Very simple limited menu but it is good.

I am kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. I found it thanks to a Yelp search. The moment I walked in I felt like I was in downtown Rocky Point. Everyone has pretty much covered the complimentary Chips & Salsa but they can't describe how delicious the Green one was. It was not like anything I have ever had. It has a taste of creamy avocados and was perfect with the Chips but also was perfect on the fried fish I had. I sliced some of the fish and put it in a freshly made flour tortilla and spooned some of the Green sauce on it and was in heaven. I ordered the fried (breaded) Fish & Shrimp. The shrimp needed no sauce at all. The breading was perfectly seasoned and the shrimp were some of the largest and tastiest I have had. There was way to much food for even a hearty eater. Don't let the location scare you it is perfectly safe and the place is warm and inviting inside. My only regret is I was to full to eat some of the yummy looking deserts in the case. I am going to make room for them next time if I have to split a plate with someone but in any case I will be back.

China Chili is my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Phoenix. They prepare their food the way you would at home without the typical mystery meat. The menu is full of lot's of choices. One of my favorites is the Honey Walnut Prawns. The Pillow Tofu is good even if you don't like Tofu. One of the Vegetable dishes (sides) that they are known for is their Spicy Garlic Eggplant.  The servings are large though, so consider sharing and getting a couple of items. The Chicken Salad is a great summer lunch dish. It is great to go. The managers are some of the nicest people you will meet.

I Love Oregano's and can't believe I have never written a review. This is my regular place. The best thing about Oregano's is the Bellini's and the staff. The food is pretty good and is a good value. Usually order the Pablo Picaso Salad (amazing) and the Alfredo the Dark Pasta with Shredded Chicken. The toasted Ravioli apps are yummy. This place is always busy, so expect a wait even during the week. The best time to come is after 9pm in my opinion. I have seen the wait as long as two hours, no joke. They don't take reservations and all the party has to be there for them to list you. Choose inside, outside or first available. You can order a drink and even apps for the wait. This is basically a bar that sells food so leave the kiddos at home. They will not enjoy it here, you will not enjoy it here with them and everyone else will not enjoy it so take them to McDonalds and leave them with a sitter. You deserve a night out anyway.  The Pizza Cookie is really good. I like Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter. The servers here really work their buts off. They will do most anything to make your meal here a great one. They even chit chat with you if you like and make you feel special. I never tip under 20% here and feel I get my money's worth every time.   They seem to have been turning over help more in the past couple of years. They have a solid business and I attribute that to their growth, but for the most part the employees seem to like working there.  My only real beef aside from the wait is there are only two bathrooms. One Male and one Female. As many customers as this place has they need to figure a way to add dividers and make it so more can use as there is always a line. The parking is not a big deal to me. They have a small lot, but there is PLENTY of street parking nearby and if there is not, then you need to come back at a different time because the wait will be a killer.

Ok so we always drive by Jordan's and wonder if it is any good. The building looks nice and they have been around forever. We got a coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try. The parking lot was pretty full for late at night. We go in and are seated and look at the menu. Both of us commented on the odd assortment of items on the Combo. Our first clue was all of the help looked as if they were from the Mid-West. We decided to have the Fajitas and a Combo. They brought out some chips that reminded me of the ones you get at Safeway in the giant bag for a buck or two. Then there was the "Salsa". It was basically Catsup, not Ketchup as in Heinz or some other reputable product, but the stuff in the huge container for 99cents, mixed with something like hot sauce. We ordered Cheese Crisps. They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the food came out. Let's just say, having eaten at Ponchos Buffet, there is worse, but places like this are usually found in the Mid-West where the people think Taco Bell is authentic. The only redeeming value to this place was the Ice Tea was tasty, that and the cashier offered to let us buy some candy to make the $40 bill (for two) so we could get the $10 off rather than the $5 off of a $20. Purchase. I thank-you for this, because it was certainly not a $40 meal ore a $30, or even a $10 for that matter, but Sir, you earned a second star because of that. Well actually it was only a half star and you added a star but since I can't give a one and a half stars, you get two.   Fellow Yelpers you have been warned. Check Yelp first, no matter how good a deal it seems.

I went there with a coupon for BOGO buffets. My stomach wishes I hadn't. Some of it was better than other. The service was great. The cheese Enchiladas were disgusting. The Sopapillas were good, the icecream??? was funny tasting. With the coupon it was still about $17 for two with two softdrinks and a tip, so I say skip it and go somewhere else. Your stomach will thank you.

Long Wongs. How do I Love your Chicken Wings. Well these are pretty near heaven. The price seals the deal. Really don't need to say much else. Oh their Cupcakes rock and the Cheese sticks too. They sell other things too but why? Not so keen on the $5 12" pizza though. Ugh.

This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. The ambiance, the food, the service. This place has it all. I was a fan of Richardson's but the Rokerij is such a nice place and I hope they will continue to offer both menus. My only beef is we booked a table for a group on Open Table and when we got to the restaurant no reservations. Honestly I think the problem was on Open Table's end. We ended up having to go to a different place but that can happen anywhere.

Mmmm. Yummy Hawaiian Food!!! Just like in Hawaii. One of my favorites is the Crispy Shrimp. Another is the Seafood Mix, another is the Hamburger Steak. Well you get the idea. I have never had a bad meal here. The plate lunches come with Rice and Macaroni Salad and Veggies. The Macaroni Salad is yummy too. They also have mini meals, family meals that serve 4 and do Catering. it's worth the drive.

La Grande Orange is my second home. You will find me here most weeekdays with my laptop enjoying the free WIFI and some yummy food. This place tends to confuse people, so here is the deal. La Grande Orange is owned by the ever so easy on the eyes Craig DeMarco. He also owns Postino Wine Cafe (2 locations), La Grande Orange Pizzeria and Radio Milano in the valley in addition to a few in California.  First of all the Grocery or LGO is not really a Grocery. It is a self-serve restaurant featuring Breakfast and Lunch all day. In addition they sell lots of Wine, Specialty Grocery items and lots of stuff you never knew you needed. Once you get your food you may sit outside or at the few inside tables or you may also sit in the Pizzeria side till 4pm. This is where it gets fuzzy. On Fridays you can also order Pizza in the Grocery starting at noon  and eat it in the Pizzeria until 4pm. At 4pm they start full service and then you have to be seated and are waited on. Confusing to newbies, but it works.   This place is full of regulars. Mostly business types, Self Employed or others than can take a 2-3 hour lunch. They have WIFI and so people come and get some work done while having a bite and there are always several tables with casual meetings or get togethers. It is a comfortable inviting place once you know the drill. My only beef is they don't serve Breakfast Alcoholic drinks like Bloody Marys or Mimosas, but I would never leave if they did, so all is well, Try their Havana Latte, Croque Madame, San Danielle Special Sandwich, any Salad... You can't go wrong here.

I am a huge seafood fan. I grew up going to places similar to this. Nothing fancy. The difference to me is the prices here are high for what you get and the Shrimp was awful. Their breading is unusually thick (about half the shrimp piece was breading). I did like the fish and the service was good. I also was expecting hushpuppies and grits for the price. Will I go back. Maybe, but I will only order the fish. It's too bad, because Phoenix could use a GOOD cheap Seafood place.

Awesome steaks. This place has certainly changed over the years. It has recently been updated and given a face lift, but the top rate service and food has remained a constant. The Prime Rib is one of the best in town. Some people are dressed up and others are in Jeans or nice shorts.

I have to admit I was hesitant about going to Marcello's after seeing the ratings but as experience has taught me I read several of the reviews and many of the one and two star reviews complained about something petty that happened rather than a review of the whole dining experience and as usual the five star reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt as well. I had a coupon from the Entertainment book (they also have coupons on their website) so I gave it a shot.  The restaurant was busy as it was a Friday night. It is a typical family owned neighborhood restaurant but a fairly large restaurant. We waited maybe 10 minutes and were seated and the manager came by and took our drink order. The waiter came by shortly and went over the specials and had some of their house made Focaccia bread brought out (to the one reviewer it is not cornbread so that is why it doesn't taste like cornbread) along with some Olive Oil sprinkled with fresh Parmesan.  We had two of the special dishes an Asparagus Tortellini dish and a dish with Chicken cutlets rolled with prosciutto and cheese. Both were very good although the Tortellini was both our favorites. I have had the Chicken dish at other restaurants and although I like it, regardless of the restaurant it is always a bit dry even with the sauce. We were both pleased with our selections and glad that we tried something different.  Although we were stuffed we couldn't resist the waiters offer to bring out the desert tray. I wish I had ordered this to go but we had a Cannoli and Flan. Both were excellent. Their Cannoli has the sweet filling and the Flan was drizzled with a Chocolate Sauce as well as the Caramel.  The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and provided over and above service checking back often. The prices were very reasonable $12-14 average for Entrees and the drinks were reasonable. There was a good crowd and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. I am glad we gave Marcello's a shot and I would certainly go back again. Give it a try, you will be glad you did.

Despite the looks of this place and the neighborhood, the food and service is outstanding. Try the Thai Tea. I ordered the vermicelli noodles that came with the egg roll on it and the banh xeo as well. Everything was delicious but the best part were the macarons. Give it a try one day it is very  tasty.

The Prime is a great Chinese restaurant. I have been going there maybe twice a year for several years. it is a bit of a drive, but the food is great, the service is great and it is affordable.  They will also specially prepare items that are not on the menu. How many places do that.

Unless this place has changed recently I can not see anyone giving it five stars. I try this place every couple of years thinking that it will get better. The food looks fine and there is plenty of it. The problem is that I get sick almost every time I eat it. Nothing serious, just an upset stomach or the like. I have heard others mention the same reaction. I keep hoping that they will fix what ever it is, because it is cheap and plentiful.

I am not sure how I have missed this little GEM. Seriously good food, ambiance and service. I had a Thai Mojito that was both delicious and potent.   For appetizers we shared Baby Spinach Salad (Incredible), Cesar Salad, Filet Mignon Beef Carpaccio (I had never tried Carpaccio before as I couldn't imagine liking it, but it was yummy), Fried Fromage d'Affinois with Homemade Strawberry Preserves (Fried Cheese and it was truly amazing and the Preserves were also amazing).  For Dinner I had Grilled Beef Tenderloin. It was incredibly delicious and cooked to taste (I prefer Med. Well and was spot on without butterflying). My only regret is that I tried someone's Pecan Crusted Smoked Pork Tenderloin. That was the best Pork I have eaten in some time. The sauce was heavenly.  This is now one of my top ten restaurants in the Phoenix area.

Blueberry Hill is the most awesome place right off the strip in Las Vegas. It is very similar to an IHOP, but Vegas'ed out. We went here for a late night meal because it was near our Timeshare. The prices were reasonable, the service was over and above especially for the time of night and the best part was the food was fantastic. The only bit that got me was they only serve certain things during certain hours and my first pick was not one being served then. They have a huge range of choices though so we ate like pigs.

Love me some Barrio.  The Barrio is one of those restaurants that you bring your visiting friends and relatives to. The place is tiny for sure and you most likely will have to wait, but have a cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere. The food is more from Southern Mexico and completely different from the other options in town. I have loved everything I have ever tried here. The guac that they make at your table is a nice show for visitors and natives alike. The service is always good and the crowd is always lively. Give it a try sometimes, you will be glad you did.

This is one of the better Pizza joints in Phoenix, I would say certainly in the top 5. My only beef with them is their lack of seating but that is a good thing I would guess as they are plenty busy. The service here rocks and the food is top notch. The best thing is they have crepes. YUM. Parking is also hard to find but after a calorie laden meal a nice walk is welcome.

Fez is a great restaurant to take people to. It is one of several new Restro-Bar's in town. Is it a bar or restaurant? Well actually both. They have a huge cocktail menu and amazing drink specials. The food is far from bar food. Everything I have ever had here was good. The specials, when they have them, are usually very good. My favorite burger is the FEZ Burger. It is not your typical burger. The service is outstanding and the crowd is easy on the eyes. Give them a go, this place is a regular for me.

Chelsea's is a welcome addition to Central Phoenix. They serve delicious takes of Comfort Food. I had been there several times and always wondered why anyone would pay so much for the tacos. Everything else seemed fair though their portions are small for most things. I didn't get that it was more like fajitas. I had the Lobster Tacos that were the nightly special (around $35.) Let me tell you it was worth it. The Lobster meat was huge chunks and very fresh. They make their tortillas in house. I have honestly liked everything I have ever had here. The only negative is the Valet Parking, otherwise it would be 5 stars. I personally can't stand Valet and especially where there is plenty of room. This place is a regular for me.

Evidently I completely blocked this place from my memory the first time I ate here. We booked this from tix4dinner saving about $2 per person. This is a perfect example of what's wrong with most buffets. The food was bland hotel food at it's best (sic). The meats were all low grade cuts and the buffet was clearly designed for quantity not quality. The redeeming part was the Chocolate fountain and the Cotton Candy. If a buffet is a must for your trip, try the Le Village Buffet at Paris. I went last year and it was several steps ahead of this one.

Went to Krave on a Saturday night. I think some of the reviewers must have gone on a weeknight because the club was packed. The drinks were good and plenty strong and the crowd was mostly Gay, but welcoming. We went with a mixed crowd and everyone had fun. The best thing is the club does not have the attitude that most clubs it's size have. The bar is large with high ceilings, but it was smaller than I expected. The main problem is there is no where to sit unless you pay for a table. That and the bathrooms are to small for when the club is packed. The sound system is awesome and the music was good. Give it a shot, I think you will have a good time.

Ticoz is another favorite place to take out of town folks or people from outside the CenPho area. The place has great ambiance, a nice crowd, friendly servers and great original food. The drink specials are amazing especially when the Mojito's are on special. This is another place where I have yet to have a bad meal. One time we brought a friend here and for some reason that particular table has a spotlight that was in his face. The place was packed so we made the most of it. We offered to switch sides, but he wouldn't hear of it. The portions are good sized and they bring you chips (not even the best store bought) and salsa. The salsa has three varieties. When they first opened they had the best salsa in town with huge stewed tomato chunks. Now it is good, but... We like to get different things and share them here. One of the things that we often get is the tamale. We like it even meatless. I have had much better food, but they have a good mix of food, ambiance and service. I don't get here as often as I would like, but it is a regular haunt.

We had an Entertainment Book coupon and checked their ratings on yelp so we decided to give La Barquita a try. The place is a dive and was pretty much as expected after reading the reviews. It was clean and the servers were friendly and helpful. We decided to try the combos and that was a good choice. There was plenty of food and it was very fresh and cooked properly. The salsa was very flavorful but a bit mild so we asked for some hotter salsa. The waitress mixed some of the Habanera in with it and it was perfect. Their Chili Rellinos were some of the best I have had. Overall it was a nice meal and I would recommend their food to anyone just realize the place is very divey but overall enjoyable.

Very good old school Steak restaurant that reminds me of how they used to be when I was a kid. It is kind of nice to see that a few places like this are still around. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. The service is superb. The best part is they serve dinner till 10 pm. My only complaint was the steaks are cooked a little more well done than most places so order it a bit less done than usual.

I had seen this place for years and always meant to check it out. I was pulling out my new Entertainment Book and voila there was a BOGO for Fuego. I checked them out on Yelp and off we headed. The parking was a bit of a confusion. Do not park in Apollo's lot, but on the side street there are spaces near the entrance. The place was packed on a late Friday night. They close at 9 and we got there about 8:30. There was live music. Some better than others (open mic?), but entertaining all the same. The crowd was very mixed. Everything from Families with kids to Gay Couples and all in between.  We were not looking at spending a whole lot of time as it was close to closing. We skipped the starters (which turned out to be a good idea). We ordered a Natural Farm Chicken Breast and a Signature Pernil Asado. The Chicken was awesome. We would certainly order this again. The Pernil Asado was less than desirable. It came with two tortillas. The meat was plenty juicy, just not all that flavorful. The Chicken though was the bomb. For sides we got the Green Chili Cornbread Casserole (YUM), Maple Chili glazed Carrots (YUM) and the Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes (Good). Not the best waitress, but hey you can't have it all. The place was very relaxing and I loved the feel of it. I am sure I will be back. They have a great happy hour, though I do recommend going for a late dinner on the weekend. To bad they are not open an hour later, but the place is nice at night. I just want to try one of their famous Mojitos next time.

This place is defenantly worth the money. The best is they include all you can eat peel-and-eat shrimp. The food was good and the place was clean and the servers were very attentive. Not the type place to take someone to impress them, but a great place if you are hungry for some Chinese.

St. Francis is a cross between the Tuck Shop and Postino. Not as good as The Tuck Shop and not as many negatives as Postino either. The place is nice although it had a kind of sterile (not in a good way) feel to it. The food was very good, I had the Skirt Steak and the service was good too. I would go back and recommend it but it does not feel like home to me.

I decided to try this place upon receiving my new 2014 Entertainment Book and finding a coupon and reading some of the reviews on Yelp. I figured the discounted price would make up for any bad service or what have you but I found as many of the more recent reviewers have noted that this place is under new ownership and is completely separate from the other Rosati's now. They do seem to have a few bugs to work out but all of the staff was very friendly and the Pizza was great. The manager on duty (young bald guy) was really cool. The place is geared mostly to take out and delivery but they have a few tables and even brought out the order to us. I would definitely recommend this place and will go back again and would like to try some of their pastas.

Switch is a great restaurant. The problem is for some reason we never think of going there. I think it is because it is a bit out of the way from other restaurants in the area, though it is close to a few other good ones. But the food is consistently good and the service is outstanding. They serve a mean cocktail too. Ask your server to recommend something for you. They will be happy to help you with the large variety of choices. I really love their brunch too.

Wahoo! This place rocks. I had been meaning to stop by this place for some time and so I just did it today. I pulled in and there was no parking so I parked next to Jack in the Box. I ordered the Magic Burger combo and was not disappointed to say the least. The burger was one of the best Mushroom burgers I have ever had and even the fries, which are dusted with moon dust, were yummy. The best thing is that it all came with a drink for only $5. and I couldn't even eat all the fries. You will see me there again.

I had heard good things about Jason's. We were in the mood for something different and on the lighter side. I had already checked out the menu online and decided I wanted a Muffaletta. I was a bit confused about the Special which includes a 1/4 Muff, ruffled Potato Chips and a pickle. The cashier said you could have a go through the Salad Bar as the side. The Salad Bar looked very fresh and that was what I went with. Let's just say I hardly ate a light meal. I made a huge salad and added some of their Potato Salad, Tuna Penne Pasta Salad and then got a desert plate and got some of their yummy Fruit Salad and some of the best muffins I have had in awhile. The Muffaletta was huge despite being only a quarter. The Salad was very fresh and the Fruit Salad was tasty as well. The place was pretty slow, but it was an hour before close on a Sunday night. The crowd was predominantly if not exclusively Gay on my visit. I am not sure if this is typical. I will certainly be back to a Jason's Deli soon. I wish they would put one in Central Phoenix soon.

Yahoo I just got an e-mail that La Piccola Cucina is trying a limited breakfast menu out this weekend. I am so glad they decided to make the Coronado neighborhood their home. I love their deserts the most because they are as good as they look. They have a couple of ways to order during regular hours. You can either order a plated meal out of the case or a sandwich combo. Either is excellent. The plated meal is basically an entree and two sides. They do finish cooking the items that are not served cold, but I hate to be the one to break it to you that most restaurants do this back in the kitchen and you never know the difference. What do you think it just came out of the oven the minute you arrived. Anyways it is mighty tasty. Give it a shot. Also try the Gelato. Andy, the owner, is a very nice guy and La Piccola Cucina is an asset to the Coronado neighborhood.

I went to Maizie's after hearing many different friends rave about the place. I had heard about the parking problem, but I was able to get a spot right out front. I immediately liked the crowd and the staff was very friendly. We decided to split the Fish Fry and the Chicken Alfredo and mentioned this to our waitress. The waitress was very sweet (I would guess she was one of the owners or manager). When our food arrived she had already divided the portions in half with each in it's own dish. That sold me on the place right there. Most places would have charged extra to do this and she did it without us even asking for it. The fish and chips were outstanding. I do think had that been all I had ordered the  fish would have been to small for the price. There were only two pieces (one for each of us) and at $14 that's a bit steep, but the sides were plentiful and tasty too. The slaw was surprising good. The hush-puppy was tasty as well and not dry at all. I am so glad that we ordered the fish, because if we had only ordered the pasta, I would never have been back. It reminded me of the $1 frozen pasta that they sell at the supermarket. It was really not good. I did rate this place with four stars though, so while the pasta was not good and the fish portions were smallish, I did really like the place and can't wait to try one of their famous burgers. The place has a great vibe and now that I know not to order the pasta, I look forward to my next visit,

Caribbean Fusion was an unexpected treat. We went on Wednesday night for their All you can eat buffet $15. They had a huge selection of meats including Seafood. The best ribs I have ever eaten, Jerk Chicken, Shrimp Stirfry, Goat, Tasty Fish, Shrimp, Oysters on the half shell. There was a make your own salad bar, homemade soup, a wonderful veggie combination, excellent mashed potatoes, beans and rice, rolls and even deserts. They also have a full bar including Pina Coladas, Mojitos, Daiquiri's... The service was top rate and the live music was a nice touch. We will be back for sure.

Wow, I happened to find DD on Yelp last night while looking for some grub. I am sold on this place. They offer high quality heat and eat or ready to eat entree's, sides and deserts as well as wine and other beverages. The place is in a strip mall but it is much higher end inside than you would expect. The prices are reasonable and the food reheats easy, usually just a bit in the microwave, but they will gladly offer tips if you need them. They do have a few tables inside and you can order eat in, but mostly it is designed to take home or back to the office.  I am glad that there is a place like DD in Phoenix. Many others have tried but DD does it right with a huge variety of fresh items. I will be back.

I had been watching this place since before they opened. I never saw any cars and thought it would not last the month. Then I noticed that the porch was full of people having lunch. The parking is in the back. I am glad I took a chance on it. America is a person and her Taco Shop is divine. It is a Mexican version of the Coronado Cafe. They have a limited menu around 10 entrees, but they are awesome. I had the Quesadilla De Carne Asada for $4.50, some chips and yummy Salsa, as well as some of the best Flan I have had and a Mexican Coke (the beverage). The counter help was attractive and efficient and I had food within minutes. I devoured it and could have eaten another Quesadilla, but I am a big eater. I liked the crowd too. Give it a shot before people find out about this place and you can't get a table.

This is the best Seafood restaurant I have ever eaten in. I have to say it is not my kind of place. Very Scottsdale. But Man they know how to cook. I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion. The Calamari was 1000 times better than any other I have had. I am not a big fan usually, but this was different. It was not fried but pan cooked and even people that didn't like Seafood tried it and loved it. The Wedge Salad was good. We shared the Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and Peas. I felt the sides were the only things that could stand some improvement. I had one of the tasty Mojitos and some Yummy Creme Brulee for desert. I am super glad this place is far away because I would want to go all the time. It is a bit pricy, but I felt it was worth it. The servers were really cool. Not uptight at all. The only thing I hated was they have rest room attendants. Maybe it is just me, but come on. I should not have to feel guilty for not tipping someone just for handing me a towel that I could have easily gotten for my self. I have little respect for businesses that do that.

FAIL, This place was cool when they first opened. I go here on occasion when I have a bunch of laundry piled up. You have to buy a card and put money on it. Well I have a couple of cards as I have forgotten to bring it before. Well I go to use one of my cards and it says invalid card. I had money on it and bought it here. Well I call the number on the back and it rings to a full voicemail box. The attendant is rarely there but I asked her and she offered no help. They even state to fill out a refund form located next to the cards. Well guess what, there are no forms or a place for them. As far as the place, it used to be clean but they cut the help and so it goes hours with no attendant. One time I was there and there was even food on the counters that someone had left. The prices are pretty steep to use the good machines and the driers take at least two cycles to dry anything. It is sad too because this place used to be nice.

I had been wanting to go to the Tuck Shop since they opened, but kept putting it off. We went with a group of six and started off with a few appetizers, The Chorizo stuffed dates were awesome as well as the Cheese Sticks. The Mac and Cheese was to die for. We had the Skirt Steak, Fried Chicken with Waffles as well as a special Pasta dish. We also had a couple of bottles of wine and a few cocktails. It really is the kind of place to share and try a variety of dishes. Even give a try things that you would not normally order because they are prepared in such a different way that you may be surprised to find a new favorite. The manager John is a good fit for this space. He is very friendly and a cutie too.  The prices are very reasonable with most of the dishes under $10 and none over $18. I found the portions very fair for the quality and the price. We were all so stuffed that we did not even order desert and even took a doggie bag home. It is such a treat to have a restaurant of this caliber in the CORONADO neighborhood. It may not be for everyone, but some people don't expect a playground to come with their restaurants.  Give it a try and thank me later.

This is a very small "hole in the wall" restaurant. They are primarily known for their catering but the food at the restaurant is some of the best around. The Chips and Salsa are winners themselves but everything I tasted was equally delicious. Try the Cheese Crisp with Green Chili's. They are not to hot but packed with flavor. The food is cheap and the portions are large so make sure to leave room for desert. They definitely have me wanting to visit Taos.

Sapna Cafe is one of those places I would have missed had it not been for the Urban Spoon App on my iPhone. I love to try new places and this place is certainly worth trying. The staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh and tasty. I had one of the daily specials. It was sort of like a breakfast burrito with eggs and other goodies in a tortilla with a side salad made of fresh greens. I also had the Ginger Lemonade and even fresh Strawberries and Creme. I wish them well, I will be back again.

We went to Postino for Brunch. I had been there before to purchase wine. Brent, their wine guy is very knowledgeable and can always give you a good tip. I am not a fan of Valet. I would pay to be able to park it myself. Postino (both locations) has the smallest parking lot and it is all Valet. This did not start us in a good mood as we drove around the neighborhood looking for parking.  We got there just as Brunch was winding down. I had my eye on the French Toast, so we went ahead and placed an order. We both had French Toast and Bacon and Bellini's. The food was very good, but over priced when you add it all up. The place was crowded and we had to sit at the bar and the service was not the best.  I really hate to sound like I don't like this Postino, because the food is certainly good and it is a nice building. Some of the staff is much better than others and I think Brunch is just chaos here as small as it is anyway. I do recommend going here but just take the negatives into account and you should have a good time.

I am not sure what took me so long to write a review but this review is based on over two dozen meals at Thai E-San. I love this place. I have to admit, I usually order to go but I have eaten in as well. The people are absolutely wonderful and the service is just right. I have never had dinner here only lunch. It is perfect for lunch with their amazing lunch specials. The curries are my favorite thing but the Pad Thai is great as well. The portions are large. My only complaint would be about the restaurant. It is not bad but doesn't have much ambiance. The food makes up for it though.

Their $7.49 weekday lunches are such a great deal. Even the soup that comes with the lunch is yummy. It's not on the lunch menu but they always make the Yellow Curry for me upon request. The Spicy noodles are very good as well.

Ok, I went to Great China because 1. I was dining alone tonight and 2. I have a guilty pleasure for buffets. I went expecting the place would be a 3 but probably no more. Well It generally is the same set-up as Hometown but Americanized Chinese Food. The crowd was about 98% Hispanic 2% Gay Men. You pay after you eat now, which seems odd. I guess they figure more tips that way, meaning less labor costs. They do bring your refills and clear your plates promptly so it is worth it.   I grabbed a plate, the first couple I picked up had food on them. I put them aside and moved to a different stack not thinking much about it with all the kids there. The one I got looked clean enough. I went through and checked out all the offerings and made my way filling up my plate. I skipped the BBQ section as I found plenty that looked good.  Most of the dishes were pretty good. Some were much better than expected such as the pepper shrimp. Another reviewer mentioned the egg rolls were like Spring rolls. Actually they had both kinds on two different tables. Both were mediocre at best. I ate everything on my plate with the exception of the stuffed crab shells, which were stuffed with some rather odd inedible filling.  I went back for seconds and picked up a soup bowl. The first couple still had food in them. Then I realized that most of them did. Thinking back on the plates earlier, I almost lost it. Come on people basic Sanitation here. Get a new dishwasher or something but fix it. Most of the other people didn't seem to care so I doubt it will be high on their priority list. I did mention it to my server.  Anyway, I don't think I will be back anytime soon after this experience. Before the Soup Bowl, I was ready to rate it a 3.5 but they lost me. Anyone rating this place a 5 is either an owner/investor or has serious munchies in my opinion.   They could easily turn this place around with better management, but I doubt they will, We will see.

I love this place. The Pecan Salsa alone is enough to keep me coming back. The Horchata is divine and the brunch offerings are filling and hearty. We shared a Traditional (Cheese) Queso which was filled to the brim with Oaxaca cheese. It was not one of those flat Quesos you find at most places. It looked more like a turnover with it's flaky tortilla dough. We each had a burro and should have split one as they were enough for a meal by themselves. We noticed their Happy Hour Street Taco deal right after ordering so that will have to wait for another visit. Pecan Salsa oh how I love you.

Ok, yes I am a guy and this is most definitely a ladies store, but I wanted to buy my Mom a nice Birthday Present. I knew she liked Vera Bradley and so I went to have a look. The sales clerk Cecile, was amazingly helpful. Since my Mom loves the Beach and we had a trip planned right around her birthday, Cecile steered me toward a nice beachy color scheme. We started with a nice Beach Bag and then added a towel, hat, some flip flops and a few miscellaneous items. Everyone made me feel welcome and my Mom loved the present. So guys are welcome at Vera Bradley, just ask for Cecile and she will set you up.

I was a huge fan of Zest and miss it, but Gasper's is a fine replacement. I have to admit I was a fan of the darker more romantic atmosphere, but Gasper's has lightened up the space a bit and it works fine. I would recommend they add a few windows to complete it. The staff is certainly spot on. Every server I noticed was very pleasant and took good care of their tables.  Let me start by saying this is not a Pizzeria. It is an Italian Restaurant with dang good Pizza. We started off with the Panzanella Bread Salad (Highly Recommend), Calamari (Some of the best I have had. I liked the sauce).  We ordered a couple of Pizzas and Osso Bucco. Everyone loved them and I loved one of the Pizza's that I tried. Really good Pizza but not the kind that would taste the same by the time you got it home, which is a good thing.  I had the Chicken Saltimbocca, It is Chicken flattened out and rolled up with Prosciutto, cooked then sliced like a loaf served over Spinach and a HEARTY Meat Sauce. The Chicken was a tad dry, but the sauce more than made up for it. I dipped the Chicken in the sauce and it was fine. Save some bread to finish the sauce because it is fantastic.  My only regret is that we did not have room for desert. The deserts sounded fantastic. The Poached Pear was one that caught my ear. We will have to make another visit.

When I heard Bliss was opening I had to go check it out as a fan of Fez, Switch and Ticoz. I love what they have done with the place. It is so much nicer than it's previous couple of attempts. I also like the parking. The staff is very friendly and the place has a mixed but heavily Gay clientele.  We decided to order cocktails. The choices were more limited than Fez and they couldn't make a Mojito so I ordered a peach martini. It was not that great and I was driving so I only had one. They were out of menus so we borrowed one from another table. hopefully they will order more. We decided to share a naked Mac and Cheese and a Cheese crisp (the waiter recommended the Tomato and pesto and a coconut Chicken tender for a starter.  The Chicken tenders were amazing. The food came out before we had even started on the Chicken but we were ready for the Mac and Cheese. It had Bacon and was spicy maybe jalapeno. The Mac and Cheese was a winner. Truly one of the better in town.   The cheese crisps were another story. It was a tortilla lightly spread with pesto, with a few slices of store bought quality tomatoes and mozzarella cheese slices on it. It was not very good and certainly not an entree by any stretch much less a $9 one. I think it should be an appetizer if anything any at most $5. Seriously I was completely disappointed with this dish. If that was what I had ordered as an Entree, I would probably not have gone back if I didn't know they could do better.  Obviously they are new and working things out. They need to work on the drink selection and add maybe three additional entrees around the $10 price range or under. The waiter said the tempura was not very good and his description didn't sound what I wanted either.  The brunch sounds good too but again it is a very limited menu.  All that said, it is going to be a great place after they work out a few things and the service is fantastic.

I had heard a couple of people mention Hamburger Haven. I stopped by to pick up a menu and was really impressed with the place. They have a huge menu of breakfast and lunch type items. The choices were overwhelming. The place is clean and the prices are very reasonable. Oh and they deliver with a minimum $10 order. I ordered a Ham and Cheese Omelet. It came with toast and Hash-browns or Home Fries. The cashier recommended the home fries. I think it was just under $5. They have an American Breakfast (eggs, Bacon, Toast and Potatoes) for under $4.  They have a HUGE menu as I mentioned. They have Hamburgers, Burritos, Fish, Shrimp and who knows what all else. If you are looking for a Local alternative to Denny's/IHOP this is your place. I predict they will do well if they can get the word out. Mmm.

Disregard all the reviews and try it for yourself. Beckett's table is a great place for a nice dinner and desert. The atmosphere is pleasant, the service is good, the prices are reasonable and the food is good. We tried the Mac n Cheese, Bacon Cheddar Biscuits, Grits and Sausage and all were great. We shared a couple salads one was the Chop and the other was a daily special. Both were also good. For the mains, we had the Short Ribs which were very good, Pork Stew (all agreed this was the best) and the Shepherd's Pie (our least favorite) and a Steak (daily special). For desert we shared the Cobbler (Amazing), Death by Chocolate which was good and the novel Chocolate dipped Bacon S'mores which we had to try, they were good btw. All in all Beckett's Table is a welcome addition that is great for most any occasion.

I ended up at Thai Basil by accident. I headed South on Central and was looking for the Thai place on Adams and Central (apparently there are more than one there too) anyway I forgot at that point you are on 1st. Well I was parked and the place looked nice so I ate here. I was seated and given the lunch menu. They promptly brought out a glass of water, silverware and a cup of broth soup. The menu was pretty typical Thai Lunch Specials for here. I noticed the BBQ Pork and that sounded good so I decided to give that a try. The soup was mostly broth but it was tasty and just the right temperature. I was surprised when they brought out the order what looked like two thin sliced pork chops on a bed of greens (Cabbage...) a pile of white rice a Spring roll and two cups of sauce. I tried the spring roll first because I am a huge fan of them. I was instantly disappointed. It was not only room temperature but it lacked much of any filling inside. The dipping sauce was ok but it would have been nice if they had some hot mustard on the table to add a bit to it. Next I cut up some of the pork and dipped it in the BBQ sauce. All was forgiven. This was very good, cooked properly and very tasty. The service was very good and the price was certainly fair. It is not one of the best Thai places in Phoenix, but it is very good and I will be back again.

I have a dairy allergy and a weakness for Ice Cream. I tried one of Nami's tSoynami's ($4.50 for a lot) which is sort of like a DQ Blizzard only made with what tastes like Homemade Ice Cream only this has Soy rather than Cow milk. I went with the Fluffernutterin (organic peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmallow flavor). I can honestly say this was better than a DQ Blizzard. They also have yummy cupcakes and cookies and other treats, coffee & Sunday Brunch. I also like their restaurant Green located next door and I am far from a Vegetarian but good is good.

We went in and stood at the podium for several minutes while all the employees walked by us like we were invisible. We finally asked someone if we could just grab a table. Then we sat there for over 10 min before someone handed us menus then the waiter came by for our order less than 30 seconds after we got the menus. He checked on is once. They had about one employee for every table so it wasn't like they were that busy. Coffee was ok. I like the Havana latte at LGO much better though. We both had the Breakfast Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Hash Browns, Bacon, Eggs & Fontina on Grilled Sourdough) aka cholesterol killer. It was decent but nothing special.  After we ate here this morning I was mentioning it to a friend of mine and she had eaten here before. She said the coffee was good, the Omlet wasn't so great and her companion stated "the server has as much personality as when I'm sleeping.". We must have had the same server. Easy on the eyes but not much else.

I would never have stopped at the Wy-Knot Cafe if it had not been for a friend mentioning it in a post on Facebook. I am glad I saw that post. There have been a number of restaurants in that location that have failed. Wy-Knot has opened the space up, made it dog friendly (it is named for their dog) and has a great menu. You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you. The employees were all very friendly. The only down side was the lack of parking due to the other businesses sharing a lot. Also there were hardly any customers. Hopefully they will deliver menus to the houses in the neighborhood and maybe do some promotions on the neighborhood e-mail service so people will know what they have to offer. I would like to see them make it.  They serve breakfast and lunch all day. They had a variety of choices and it was hard to decide on one. We split a BLT and a Chicken Salad Sandwich so we could try both. They come with a side of beet salad or salad of the day. The beet salad was very good. We both preferred the BLT but I am sure the Chicken Salad was more healthy and it was tasty as well.  Give them a try, I think you will enjoy the Wy-Knot Cafe. I will be back.

Think 60's hippie Vegan "restaurant". The sign says cafe and there are two booths inside and some picnic tables outside. The menu is written on sheets of paper (shown in the Yelp photos) but they offer a large variety of beverages and for the size restaurant a good selection of food. I had the Tacos. You get two tacos and a side salad. My partner had the Burrito and it also came with a side salad and was more than he could eat. He also had a Smoothie which was very tasty. I didn't see anything on the menu over $7. The food took awhile to come out but it was nice outside so we didn't mind. I really enjoyed the food and plan on going back. The girl that waited on us was super nice.  place is not for everyone but if you are Vegan/Vegetarian or like myself not Vegetarian it offers something different and it is certainly healthier for you.

I loved International House of Food. The selection is wonderful and the staff recommended a few items to try and they were all very good. The restaurant is not in a great area but don't let that stop you from trying it as it is very safe and the staff are wonderful.

There is only two things you really need to know. The Seafood is fresh and the Service is great. The best thing on the menu is the jar of crab in butter served with toast but the portion is about half what it was back when they opened and the price is the same. The hush puppies are authentic and very good. The thing you have to watch here are the cocktails. They are outstanding but very small and add up in a hurry. Our drink bill is always double our food bill here but overall it's a good time and there aren't many fresh Seafood options in Phoenix. Fried Green Tomato's would be a welcomed addition to the small plates menu.

I had noticed this place a few times at it's old location and thought it was in an odd location. I drove by the current location and didn't realize it was the same restaurant until I looked it up online. The location is a much better one than the old one however they still have quite a bit to work on if they are going to make it over the long term. The Owner/Manager was waiting on tables and there seemed to be no managing of the restaurant. People were waiting to be seated or to cash out and no one seemed to be in charge just who ever was free. They seemed to have enough help, just poorly managed. The workers were all friendly and once we were seated we received prompt service. I noticed the Biscuits and Chorizo gravy and decided on the "Number 1" as they were included. My partner chose the Chicken Fried Steak which was covered with Sausage Gravy. The Chorizo Gravy had an ok flavor but the Sausage Gravy was much better. I was told that you could choose either and I would go with the Sausage if I ordered them again. Also, I thought the Chicken Fried Steak was a much better value as it came with Homefries, eggs and a biscuit for just a bit more. I noticed some other reviewers commented that the Ice Tea was not great. I ordered it knowing this and I agree. It was very weak and had an off taste. The Coffee was very good though. I understand the menu is limited (as are the hours) but maybe they will work through their Management issues and can expand both their hours and menu as I would love to see them make it and they have most of the parts to make a successful go. I will certainly be back as the Country Fried Steak was very tasty and overall it is a good value. I suggest giving it a try and read your fellow Yelper's tips as many were spot on.

Their menu is sparse and I have only tried their breakfast but their ricotta pancakes are all you need to know. They are fantastic, the people working there are very nice and the space is pleasant. You can order sides as well.

My only complaint is they keep running out of my favorite flavor of donuts but I guess that keeps me trying new ones. The chicken is very good. Take a walk on the wild side and eat it as it's meant to with the sauce on it. I had the Korean Chili Chicken, Thai Yum Slaw and a Classic Cake Donut when I went for lunch but I have had some of their yummy donuts on other trips. I am sort of glad they are not closer becuase their donuts are the best in town.

Loved Cous Cous Express. It is a nice hole in the wall place with amazing food and service. The cous cous is served in a platter (unless you order vegetarian) for the table so order a couple of dishes and share. I recommend the lamb. It was very tender and flavorful and the date shakes are the best part. The Chebakia is a very sweet treat at the end and similar to an item served in Indian Restaurants.

Fantastic place. Their Heirloom Tomato, Mozzarella & Prosciutto Panini was the best I have ever had. I liked it even better than Bianco's. My only wish is that you could order a half sized or side salad to go with it. I think the Panini's are better than their pizzas but I have only had one. The service is great and the prices are reasonable.

Fantastic breakfast food. They seem to have the slowest cashiers in the restaurant business and unfortunately have a fly problem on their back patio but everything we have tried there (with the exception of the grits) was fantastic. I haven't tried their lunch offerings yet.
