So delicious. Probably the best breakfast place in Phoenix. The service was fine, and it was nice to eat breakfast outside on a cold brisk morning. There are heaters outside too!   The food was excellent. We tried the chili and Monte Cristo -- so so so good. I'm going back.

Breakfast was delicious. I have not been back, but the Eggs Benedict was the best I've had in Arizona. Service was great as well...I hope to be back soon.

Carne is the best. Yum. Have been back tons of times. Will always go back. Enough said.

Bomb Pho. Spring rolls are ok, not as good as Miss Saigon in Tucson. But probably the best Pho on the east side for its price.

First off, the food was good. Not great, but good. We got the Kobe burger and the Turkey sandwich, both delicious.I'd eat there again...but here were the problems:  1) We went on a night where there was a private party that took up the whole dining room so we had to eat at the bar, losing the good view that the restaurant claims to have. The only view we had was a couple macking away.  2) The worst factor of all: the weird DJ that BLASTED music throughout the restaurant. We thought that the ambiance was supposed to be part of the VU's appeal but it was the worst part of the night. If we wanted to hear deafening, bouncing club beats and DJs singing karaoke and being the MC of the night, we would've went to Scottsdale. We literally had to yell to hear each other talk.  Safe to say we'll never be back there with that kind of experience. Hopefully future private parties they plan won't be so disruptive.

I love this place. I'll be back there again. The cheesecake and sweet potato fries are some of the best I've had in the valley, and the ambiance was great, especially that fireplace!

Delicious. The dessert is wonderful, with fresh crepes and pies made.  Entrees are also freshly made, I love the smoked salmon, prime rib, and all the pastas.

Very small, but hip uptown ice creamery that is joining the trend of nice little eateries around that area. I love it, and I hope it gets bigger.  Only problem...parking is very tough

Everything is good. Everything. So refreshing!  My wife and I moved away from Phx just as Snoh was getting big, and wow do we miss it. We recently came back from Philadelphia and drove out to Phx from the East Valley just to eat at Snoh. It is truly better than any Snoh I had in Taiwan -- they know what they're doing! We would gladly fly back just to eat Snoh again. Keep up the good work guys.
