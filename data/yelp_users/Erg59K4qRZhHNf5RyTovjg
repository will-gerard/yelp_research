had an appointment at 3:30 to get my sons 15mo wellness and vaccinations. we get there and the lady at the front desk informs us our appointment was at 3. mind you, I have in all 25 years of my life never been late and NEVER gotten the time for an appointment wrong. I pride myself on this. instead of being accommodating she was incredibly rude and told us we'd be getting a no show charge. mind you, if I was a no show, WHY WOULD I SHOW UP? so disappointed. she wouldn't let me schedule an appointment with the office manager either, told me I could call and make one over the phone. I don't mind the charge, I do mind the fact that my son missed his vaccinations that week because Cheryl, the person assigned to booking appointments couldn't do her job.   I wasn't too crazy about this place to begin with, the doctors are very rushed and always seemed like I was inconveniencing them by asking questions. so this just threw me over the top.   0/10 DO NOT recommend

I moved to surprise and really missed the Chinese food I grew up on me in Peoria! (Big heng and good China)   After trying Chen wok and being disappointed I was hesitant to try BB but I am so glad I did! It's not hands down my favorite restaurant

Gary did my csection with my first son and there's nobody in the world id want besides him to do my second. I love the office, I love the medical staff, all though I will say the ladies at the front desk aren't the nicest people I've ever met, I'm often rushed and ridiculed when I call or even to make an appointment but; don't let that stop you from getting quality care which is exactly what you'll get from the medical staff.

place was great at first, then they lost our Doctor and things went down hill quickly. The main Doctor is fantastic, and great with kids. But it takes me a week to make an appointment because it just goes straight to voicemail every single time I try. That's obviously not reliable, so I will be switching. (I have the screen shots to prove it if anybody would like proof, please message me)

I've been charged twice now for extra cheese (which I don't mind the charge) only to come home and find my order has absolutely zero cheese. Other than that, they never give me sauces, always get my order wrong.

I can't wait until more fast food options open up around cotton. the only reason I go here any more is for the convenience in location. I'm a pretty easy person to please seeing as how my order usually ranges from tacos to bean and cheese burritos...Last time I went I got charged $1.88 for extra cheese, came home and opened my burrito up and what would you know, absolutely no cheese. I never get my sauces and always have to turn back around..It's so frustrating coming here. I am always SO polite, I speak clearly when I order, and still..Never get my order correct.

We LOVE Scott & Wayne, and their whole crew! There really aren't enough words to describe the professionalism and quality this company possess.   Let me start off with this, we called 5 people to come out and give us quotes. Of the 5, Wayne was the one who shined the most to us. (Aside from giving us the best price we received) Really friendly guy, knows what he's talking about, and helped us with the design and shade of color we should go with.  From there we decided to make a deal, gave him our deposit and the next week he was over with his color charts helping us pick our color. He was always on time, always answered our calls and questions.   The start date happened and they were a man short. Wayne had recently been injured and needed time off. We were really worried the job wouldn't be completed in the time we agreed. With two small children it was really important to us that this job didn't take more than two days.  They worked their BUTT's off, early morning, late night to get it completed. The entire time they were clean, polite, and super friendly. ( my husband stayed home while I went with the kids to my mothers ) The entire time they were working their butts off they were still carrying conversation with my husband which he appreciated. ( he likes to be apart of the process lol)   They finished in the two days they said they would, then Scott did a complete walk through of the house and went through all the tiny little spots the size of a period ( . ) my husband had marked out ( lol, he's so meticulous and Scott really didn't have to do that )   There was zero mess, the walls look perfect and we literally COULD NOT be more happy with their performance.   I will use this company for as long as  we have painting needs!

The people complaining about Winco are the same people who will complain about a parade on a sunny day. Ridiculous. I love Winco. Awesome prices, awesome environment, my kids love going for the free cookies in the bakery, all around awesome place to save money on groceries.

nothing but positive things to say about this salon, the staff is incredible, the owners are awesome and the salon itself is beautiful.  today I got a set from Kathy, she is so smart and takes pride in her work and I really admire that. I will never go anywhere else to get my nails done, they've earned my business for life!   also, please keep in mind the negative reviews are typically from "those types" of people that can't be satisfied no matter what, we've all encountered someone like that sitting next to us at the salon.
