I bought a house about a year ago, and unfortunately did not completely realize what I was getting myself into. My a/c is old and neglected. Needless to say we have had several issues with it in this short year and have had several different companies come out to check and help with the numerous breakdowns we have had. Of all the companies that have come out Shamrock has really stood out above the rest.   Every one recommends that we buy a new a/c, and frankly that is not an option right now, so we just need to do what we can to keep the current one running. Our first call out to Shamrock was at the beginning of July, right in the thick of our 110+ degree weather. They were able to get to us within 24hours, which was better than most other overbooked companies. When their technician arrived he was very friendly and polite, took time to listen to my explanation of the problem then went to see for himself. After careful review he let me know he had to go get a new part and to my HUGE relief, was going to be able to fix the problem that day. After a couple of hours of work he knocked on my door and brought me the piece that he removed/replaced and explained what it was and how it broke. I was surprised he took the time to explain, especially because I am a female - all other male technicians I had experienced with other companies treated me as though I would never understand so all I needed to know was whether the problem ws fixed or not. He then went on to give me recommendations on how to keep my unit running more effeciently and suggested maintenance options. Of course this was his selling point but I respectfully declined, and instead of the uncomfortable awkwardness you usually get when trying to get rid of a "salesman" IN your house, he acknowledged my choice and was polite when leaving.   Within two weeks another piece failed, I called Shamrock again and they fixed within 24hours and I was not charged the service fee because it was reported within such a short time of my initial call. I ultimately had to call a third time and had the same experience, and again was not charged the service fee. By this time I know the technician and we discuss the maintenance options again and at this point I am not only eager to sign up, but am completely confident that I am making a good investment with a company I trust.   I am happy to report the a/c has been functioning well and Shamrock has definitely won our business and loyalty!

We were in a bind for an upcoming event as our regular upholsterer was overbooked, so we ventured out and found Jose. We could not have been happier with our experience. Not only was Jose able to get our project done in a mere two days, but it was some of the best quality upholstery we've ever gotten, and even the pricing exceeded our expectations. We will absolutely be using him for future projects and recommend you do the same!

RWB is our solid go-to. Here in the East valley we're deprived of good food options, but we are never disappointed with a visit to the brew. They've always got a fresh special if you want to try something more seasonal, and they do their staples consistently well. If you leave hungry, it's your own fault. My favorite is the Chicken Marsala, big enough to feed at least two if you order it over linguini, it always ends up my lunch for the next day. We also recommend ordering a side of marinara to dip the garlic bread in and we have never been disappointed by a soup du jour!

It was Date Night and we were looking for a culinary experience, We did have to make special advance reservations but we opted for a Chef's Selection Five-Course Tasting Meal.  As we enter we are immediately welcomed graciously by the friendly host, our table isn't ready yet so we get a chance to observe the resident artist create a beautiful and colorful piece in the restaurant lobby. He takes a moment to chat with me about his work and the restaurant is adorned with it work throughout.  Once we are seated we decide on some of the Muddled Cocktails trying the Very Berry and the Mambo Mango. Both tasted very "fresh" it was obvious the fruit used were at their peak and the flavors were balanced expertly.   For our first course we tried the Billionaire Tacos (we may not be, but we can dream) and the Rainbow Ceviche. These were out-of-character selections as I am not a "seafood" person, but I was happily surprised. The "fishy" flavor I dislike was nowhere to be found in either of these dishes. Both were a perfect melody of flavors, our favorite enhancement being the red jalapeno that really woke your taste buds (and sinuses) up. Also, incredibly noteable was the yuca wrapped mahi-mahi. It literally melted in your mouth. It was savory, buttery, crisp and tender.   The service was excellent and the food memorable. You can bet we will be visiting Deseo again.

I've been to several dentists and always struggled finding the right one that offered both a great dentist and staff. I couldn't be happier to have found Dr Panelli. Not only is he great, but so is his friendly staff. I had a small chip in my tooth that I was self conscious about and had paid lots to have fixed in the past, not only did Panelli fix it perfectly, but he guaranteed his work, something my past dentist didn't do. I highly recommend making your way to his office!

I love the concept, I love the decor, I love the idea, hopefully the food can catch up.   We knew going opening week would be under par as the staff tries to gain their groove, so we went in with I'd say low expectations. We weren't disappointed. Our server knew nothing about the products on the menu or the beverages offered.   My friends each got craft brews and were offered non-chilled glasses, they opted to just drink out of the bottle. I tried the Strawberry fields cocktail. It tasted purely of artificial syrup - nothing fresh about it, and I couldn't tell if the Vodka made it in the glass or not.  We decided to start with the Pretzel and then each opted for different Brats so we could share and get a variety. The pretzel didn't come out till the brats did - so much for ordering an app. When it did finally arrive it was a very dark brown and somewhat mangled look,  we could have gotten past that if it at least tasted good, but not only was this pretzel an eye sore, it was a mouth sore. It was everything you don't want a pretzel to be - tough, chewy and burnt. Finally, the Brats... the Brats themselves weren't bad, but the Brat:Bread Ratio was way off. We received these huge Brat buns that were easily double the size of the actual brat. I wouldn't call myself a Brat aficionado I just can't imagine how you screw up such a simple and easy item - especially if you are the "Brat Haus". The one item of the whole evening actually worth noting was the Apricot Chutney, it was flavorful and the only reason I was able to finish my bready meal.   I would be up to giving them another chance, it seems everyone else had a much better experience. I hate to leave bad reviews, but hey, you can't win them all!

I backed into my trash can and bent the muffler, I also needed an oil change. Henry was so helpful and they were very accommodating, had me in and out within an hour, and I was able to work on my laptop as they had a desk and free Wi-Fi. Exactly what a busy lady needs. I'll be coming back for sure!!

It cracks me up to see people complain about having to "run" in a 5k (because they wanted to walk) or to have to battle the elements. That's why these things say "Rain or Shine" - they really mean it.   My group and I had a blast! The weather was cold, the rain didn't seem to want to stop, but the volunteers and coordinators kept the energy up regardless. There was TONS of color to go around, every station got you doused (if you wanted) and they were more than generous with "extra" color if you asked. At the end the concert and after party were fantastic. The music was great and the energy even better.   After having done several other similar events, I would have to say this was by far the best. Well organized, and fun, what more do you want?

We have a blast every time we come here, from my nine year old son to my  50yr+ parents! Prices are reasonable and there's plenty to keep everyone entertained even while you're waiting for what at first seems too long for your bay. The wait has never been as long as they quote, but either way we're having a great time by the time it's our turn and it keeps on going. Friendly staff, good drinks, decent food, what more do you need?
