This place is the best. Being italian from NY, it is hard to find good Italian food. I am very pick! The fried calamari is not rubbery! Their bread is awesome! If you don't like Olive Garden, try this place!!!

Great place to watch football! Staff is on the ball at this place. The food is good and they have drink specials night of the week. I think I found my new place to watch Monday Night Football!

I love this Fry's! The employees are friendly and very helpful. Prices are always good! There deli has so many options. I like this one also because it is just food and not a marketplace!

First time eating at a place like this. The food was great! The atmosphere was awesome.   You have a server, who brings you drinks and takes your order. They were very quick. Then you also have the person who's going to prepare and cook your food. Part of your table is the grill they cook on. They put on a show while they cook. My cook made a flame about 4  feet tall. Yes, it  was hot, but very awesome.   I will be going back and trying another another dish. Very entertaining and great food!

First time going to a place like this. It was intense. It's not a regular full body massage but they pin point certain areas. The foot and calf massage was awesome! I will have to go back!

Their coffee selection is awesome!  So many screamers to choose from. You can do hot or iced coffee. They also have frozen cappuccino too.
