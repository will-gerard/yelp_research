Bud (the owner and head mechanic) is the reason I keep buying Mercedes. Every time I look at another brand I wonder who will take care of it (and me and my wallet) when it breaks. MB Motors only works on Mercedes Benz (get it? M.B.?), but they handle everything from basic annual services to complex engine issues. The shop is family run and customers are treated as family and as friends. They are consistently fair and reasonable with pricing and honest about what repairs truly need to be made. Fair, reasonable, honest, mechanic - not much else I could possibly add to that.

If one must pay to have hair forcibly removed from their body, one should find the most comfortable and accommodating place to endure said deed.   I usually see Judy herself, as her calm demeanor and friendliness make the process all much easier - and she is quick with that wax. But, as I am often trying to fit in an appointment last minute for an occasion or trip I take who ever they'll give me and all of the girls have been great. Their prices are reasonable for all services. With regards to scheduling, they offer late hours one day a week and are open till 6 several days, which is all very convenient for arranging my typically last minute appointments.

On a Saturday morning as I was leaving the Scottsdale Farmer's Market this good looking fellow knocked on my window startling me and my poor sleeping dog. Based on the fact that it was mid day in Old Town, and his knocking wrist was adorned with a pretty fancy watch, I concluded he was not a mugger and rolled down the window. The gent didn't want to ask us to lunch (disappointing), but did let me know I had a flat tire (also disappointing but helpful). He then directed me to the Discount Tire down on Scottsdale Road indicating they'd air it up or help me change it.   I rolled down the street on my now sad tire and spoke with the fellas at the tire shop. The Scottsdale shop is undergoing some major renovations at the moment and the seating was all outdoor under a bright red tent. They were still surprisingly proficient and quick about changing the spare even as the guys were working out of make shift bays and storage units.   My one annoyance was when I mentioned I usually buy my tires at Costco and the guy helping look at the tire made some smarmy remark about how I buy from Costco, but come to Discount to get them fixed for free. I a) had gotten this car with the tires on it about a year and a half ago and b) was just letting him know I wanted to check prices before I did anything (reasonable for a $1000 purchase) and c) actually expected them to charge me something to put the spare on the car. I had no idea they'd do this for anyone at no cost.  They did tell me that I needed 3 out of 4 of them replaced, but I am not one to make a major purchase without some research (i.e. calling Bud over at MB Motors so he could tell me what to do).   I stopped by the Discount near my office at Kyrene and Elliott and went over some of the options available with the sales staff. The tires I wanted were about $40 more each than the ones on the car currently and they didn't have them in stock, but he said he could get them when I was ready. Despite the fact that I am pretty sure these guys get some kind of commission, there was no pressure and he notated the tires, told me they'd beat any other price I came up against and sent me on my way.  I did a lot of comparison shopping and found that Discount did, in fact, have the lowest price on the brand and size tire I wanted. But, the particular type was sort of special order and two other shops had told me it might take 3-4 days to get the tires in. Once I finally made my decision and was tired of driving around on the less than attractive spare wheel, I made the order and these guys had it in that afternoon. I made an appointment the next day at lunch and they had my car done in the promised hour. I highly recommend scheduling an appointment once you make your tire choice. You are prioritized over walk-ins, plus I like seeing my name on the little board when I come in.

Dave's Metro did a terrific job on my recent glass replacement. They came recommended by my long time Mercedes mechanics at MB Motors, and they've never let me down in ten years. So it was an easy decision to make.   The gal who set up my repair called in to my insurance with me and had the claim set up in short order. She worked with me to determine the correct glass for my car (seriously no idea how many variables there are here) and they set up an appointment for the next day.   The gentleman arrived at my office exactly as scheduled (no we'll be there sometime between noon and Tuesday) and had the glass replaced and the cute little Mercedes Benz sticker back in the widow in about an hour. They were able to work with my insurance to approve OEM glass. While I realize about 2% of people who ever look at my car will ever notice this detail - it makes this girl very happy.   I know you have lots of options for glass repair, which may or may not include a year of free Chinese dinners, but consider Dave's if you're more concerned about getting the right windshield for your car than free lo mein.

I will go into extensive detail later, but my experience was very similar to that of Chandra's with Janet Bailey. I took my dog in with certain symptoms and a history of auto-immune issues. She then allowed us to spend over 2K$ on xrays and a sonogram. In retrospect I recall her saying that she may not even be able to see anything on the sonogram due to my dog's size, but I feel they played on our emotions and love for our dog to push us to make this decision.   The vet tech who handled my dog was extremely rude and mishandled my very well behaved dog right in front of me - twice. The last time they asked to come in for a "tech check" and I refused as I did not want this woman alone with my dog. No dog is thrilled to be at a veterinarian's office, but she was absolutely terrified of this chick. I had expressed this to the front office staff and Janet Bailey who assured me she would not be allowed back around my dog again. Then after a consult with our regular vet we went back to get an idea of what "Dr" Bailey thought and there this tech was again. They wanted to take blood and I refused, in great part because I doid not want her out of m sight with my dog.   I suggested that I may be able to get some of the tests done somewhere else at a more reasonable cost and this same vet tech told me that they would just charge me a fee to review them so I may as well get them done there. No review fee could equal the almost double cost estimate given by my personal vet versus what they suggested. This to me was a clear indication that they were in fact looking for money and not a solution to my dog's condition.   In a few weeks care in another vet's office my dog is doing better and I do not have anxiety over his intentions or that he will take his bottom line into greater consideration than my beloved pet's health. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy - because, hey, their dog didn't do anything.

We love Dr. Howard and his staff. I make the half hour drove up here because we trust him to do what's best but not at unnecessary expense. Reagan has a level of comfort with him than I've not witnessed with any other veterinarians.   As an added bonus they have a groomer so I can get her nails clipped at the same time. Totally worth the $12 to avoid that stress for both of us. Leave it to the experts, and let your dog blame someone else!

I am so pleased with the lunch I just picked up here I'm writing this review while I eat it (much better use of multi-tasking than getting back to work as intended, don't you think?).   Perusing Yelp for a decent Chinese place near my office, I found the Gourmet Wok was just about a mile away hidden behind a Taco Bell in a strip mall tucked between a nail salon and a dentist office run by a guy name Nguyen. A little Google magic revealed their menu and list of lunch specials. I ordered the Szechuan Chicken, which was $4.45. You have to pay a premium of $4.75 for beef or shrimp And, because I already threw caution to the wind this morning and had margarine on my white toast, I went ahead and had them throw in an egg roll for another $0.70. I also kind of figured I wasn't getting much food for under $5, which was an incorrect assumption on my part as I will likely be eating left over Chinese for dinner tonight.   The food itself was very flavorful (albeit not hot enough for me, but that's why I keep Sriracha packets in my desk drawer anyway) and there was plenty of it. The broccoli was still bright green and crunchy, there were lots of carrots and they mixed in lots of those little baby corn bits everyone loves.   I grabbed a couple of take out menus for the office and will try to entice my co-workers into switching to this place for delivery ($10 minimum so I'll need some help) from the other place nearby, whose name I will not mention, with whom I am less enamored.   Incidentally, I would say that this is definitely a takeout/delivery joint. The interior is not exactly decorated for comfort. It reminds me of the little Asian places I would order from in Toronto or San Francisco. Sometimes there is an indirect correlation - the less comfy the restaurant, the better the food - when it comes to good Chinese and/or Mexican.    Who knows what the next visit will bring, but for the moment, for the money, I could not be happier.

I love this place. I don't really know what else to say. You can sing the praises of any burger joint in town, but I haven't come across one that beats the flavor or the au poivre II - juicy beef, big enough for two, cracked peppercorns, thick cut bacon, wine sautéed onions plus blue cheese... it is a brilliant combination and has never disappointed, and I rarely even order a burger.   If you would prefer to skip the beef the AZ88 chicken is doused in buffalo sauce served on a bun with blue cheese (everything should be served with blue cheese) and is a great choice. If you'd like to forgo the beef and the bun, the AZ88 salad offers the same spicy buffalo chicken breast on top of the already well devised Four Season's salad, which offers a nice mix of fresh ingredients beyond your basic lettuces and tomatoes.   You can't review AZ88 without discussing the cocktails - well you could, but it would be a shame to overlook these tasty little concoctions. Actually, "little" isn't a word I would use to describe the adult beverages here. AZ88's martinis are legendary for their size. I've heard complaints about the cost of the drinks here, but you are getting a lot of bang for your buck in that martini glass. The liquid tests the laws of viscosity and your waiter's balance as it makes its way to your table. It is a real challenge to see if you can pick it up from the table in a smooth enough manner to keep all the liquid in the glass. My favorite stolen from AZ88 cocktail trick is to make cubes of frozen juices and cover them in vodka - no mixing required! This makes me look super slick when I have a party (shhh).  I just recently found out AZ88 is dog friendly on the patio, which just makes me love them all the more. I have a feeling my Italian greyhound will be a big fan of the burger and will also appreciate the fact that it's way too much for me to eat on my own.

For some reason my co-workers continue to want to order food from this restaurant every Friday when the boss is buying. All free lunches have their tradeoffs, and for me, this one is no longer worth it. On a couple of occasions I have tried the individual pizzas, which taste a lot like the cardboard they come in. One of my office mates raves about the meat ravioli; tried that once and as another reviewer indicated, it tasted like it came out of a can.   I am going out to lunch today and buying my own food (better to escape the smell of raw onions one of these "ladies" likes to cram onto her meatball sub).   In the several times I have tried to order off this menu it seems like something listed doesn't actually exist in their restaurant. No, we don't have sun dried tomatoes; no, we don't have balsamic dressing...   Today I thought I would just get a salad, but I didn't want the heavy garlicky dressing that they usually thrust upon you and asked for olive oil instead. I was advised they don't have olive oil. I understand maybe in this neighborhood the sun dried tomatoes aren't a popular item, that they might be out of balsamic (actually I don't really because, although they have been listed on the print and online menu for the last 8 months, they never have had those effing tomatoes). However, how can any Italian restaurant not have olive oil?  The descriptions for a couple of their dressings mention that they are made in house. Perhaps these people use canola oil in their dressings rather than olive oil, which sounds kind of Italian. It's actually Canadian - in case you were wondering.

I'd follow Stephen right back to Leigh-on-the-Sea if I had to. Luckily for me he's well landed here at Snapdragon in Phoenix and I love this place (almost) as much as I love Stephen. Just for the record I kind of hate getting my haircut. I love the way it looks afterwards, but I always let it grow out too long and my bangs are hindering my eyesight by the time I give in to the necessity. I have been seeing Steve for years and a haircut with him is like a well need visit with an old friend (replete with a few laughs). I only wish all my friendly visits would leave me looking so good. The cut, blow dry and style are $65, which is totally reasonable considering the time and finesse that go into cleaning up my all too often overgrown mop.   The nice thing about this salon is that it has a cool but not a toohipforyou vibe, coffee made to order (I even got my almond milk) and a very friendly staff. Last time I was in the gal at the counter helped me figure out where to take my visiting friend for dinner. As I write this I am wondering why I don't start getting my haircut more often.

I have visited this location several times in the past and the people are friendly, but the wait is always inordinately long. I do realize going through a drive thru at prime coffee buying hours will create a longer wait time than usual, but I am certain I was in line for over 20 minutes and likely close to 25, behind 6 cars, with one individual each, none of whom appeared to be collecting enough coffee for an army. I would have come in, as for some reason, they are always able to more quickly accommodate more people inside at this location, but had my dog in the car and with the temperature in AZ this time of year, leaving her would not have been a viable option.   After having waited for what I feel was an excessive amount of time (given the factors above I was able to ascertain during my time watching from the car window), I also left with an incorrect order. I had asked for a venti Americano with soy and to add the pumpkin syrup and a particular breakfast sandwich. I guess I have to believe that this beverage getting cold in front of me is an Americano, but, while I detect the pumpkin, there is definitely no soy (or any other type of milk/cream). I could probably have lived without the pumpkin if they'd remembered the milk; But, (and I am no aficionado) this does not even seem like very good coffee. On top of the above, it seems possibly burnt, and definitely bitter.   I also ordered a breakfast sandwich, which should have come on an English muffin and this morning was given what I can only compare to something you would get from McDonalds (for less money) on some kind of roll. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any of this until I was in my office, and I don't have time in my day to drive back to the coffee shop to remedy the situation.   There is another drive thru closer to my house, but in the opposite direction I need to travel to work, and while they are also very busy at early hours, the wait does not seem disproportionate to the number of cars, and, when I have had to wait they are, at a minimum, apologetic about the delays. Perhaps they might consider having a second cashier or customer service person attend the window during high volume hours. The gent on this trip was nice enough, but wasn't exactly moving at a speedy pace either.   I have been a Starbucks customer for about 10 years, and a large reason for that loyalty is the consistency of service and product from store to store. I recently received a gold card (wish someone had told me about that program years ago) and the shop inside the Safeway nearest my office is terrific (review to be forthcoming). If I had left with the right order or at least been able to drink the now cold coffee on my desk I would probably be a lot less grumpy at the moment, which my co-workers would probably appreciate as well.

I am not sure how anyone could say the service here is subpar. I often stop in for happy hour and am always treated well, even when just having a few cocktails and a snack. The bar staff is very friendly, and I seem to always meet someone new and interesting in the lounge (recently it was a certain individual running for congress in the district - admittedly, I had no idea who he was on sight, but he was cordial and indulged me in a little political banter).   As for happy hour - how many high-end resorts or steakhouses offer any kind of a happy hour, much less one so reasonable? The bar offers 5 appetizers, 5 wines by the glass, 5 beers, and 5 cocktails for $5. The food offered are truly appetizers - don't go in looking to get stuffed on the $5 menu (although if you like lounge food you can always go next door to the R-Bar - review on that to come). I do love that they keep you plied with gourmet olives and almonds (complimentary and good for your skin - win, win).   The choices of wine by the glass are impressive given the price tag - I could drink the Malbec daily. The cocktails are a mixture of new and old world and offer some unique combinations. The spicy peach Collins features a jalapeno infused gin. One of the aforementioned friendly bartenders showed me how to make it for myself and I'm looking forward to using it to impress guests.   Yelp is showing the restaurant has a summer prix-fixe menu for $50 - it is actually $36 ($50 during Arizona high season), and is a notable value. If you check their website know it doesn't get updated regularly, although, it does change regularly. The last time I was in the menu offered a blue cheese wedge, scallops, a crab stuffed twice baked potato and somekindofwonderful blueberry dessert. The prix fix menu provides two choices for each of four courses, these were just my favorites.   Up until a few days ago I probably would have written a 4 star review for the BLT, but recently was in with company who ordered the $85 porterhouse steak (for two it isn't such a bad price when you compare it to steak prices at places like Morton's, the Capital Grille etc). I've been working my way through a list of overdue reviews and after having a few bites of this steak decided this one had to be done and had to be 5 stars. This was far and away one of the best steaks I have ever sunken my teeth into. It was relatively rare for my usually Midwestern medium tastes, but it was so soft, tasty and buttery, I may just be a convert .  If I have one negative thing to say it is that the patio space could use a serious revamping to make it a comfortable and an enjoyable place to sit and watch the sunset across Camelback Mountain, Malbec in hand.

If I could give this place minus five stars, it would happen. The pretension and rudeness is absurd for a moderately busy restaurant in downtown Phoenix. The food and drink menu is decent, however, the staff cannot seem to get over themselves and their self-importance despite the fact that this place is mediocre at best these days.

I don't think I have eaten at a Panda Express since high school. I don't think I need to go back unless I am in fact with someone in high school. Needing to grab something quick and get back to a hectic Monday at the office I was lured in by the drive thru... My food was edible, but very oily, lacking in any kind of distiguishable flavor and the meat was fatty.   On the up side my fortune cookie was tasty and entertaining. But, if you want quick "Chinese" in the area, be slightly less lazy, get out of your car and go in to the Tokyo Express down the street.

I really want to start this review with "I don't know where to begin". To make things easier on myself I will simply start at the beginning. I've been hearing about this place for months and am now wondering why I wasn't listening.   We made reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday night and my one complaint will come out now... when we arrived the hostess had us seated at a small table in the corner. Insert infamous line from Dirty Dancing here in case you can't guess how I felt about that. The place was busy, but not packed and I asked the hostess if we could wait for seats at the long counter that surrounds the kitchen. (You really want to sit at the counter BTW).  She seemed a little put off by this and tried to dissuade us from waiting. I am not really sure why, because it wasn't like they were anywhere near closing and they do have a small bar. Really, what is a restaurant bar for if not to wait for your seats? I was insistent, because that corner could have ruined my evening - yes I am serious.   So, two drinks at the bar later - we were shown to our seats in the center of the counter and brought menus. I am sure it has been explained somewhere along the Yelp-highway, but you cross off your individual paper menu anything you don't care for or have an allergy to and the chef does the rest of the work. I often use the process of elimination when I am overwhelmed by a restaurant menu, so this was perfect for me. The list of options isn't huge, but I chose to take off steak and shrimp. I have had all manner of preparation for steak and shrimp and this was a great opportunity to try something really different.   I also love that you get a space at the bottom to write what you don't like. Beets touching my food could have been a game changer. Also, I don't personally care for chocolate. Letting them know these little details aids in tailoring your dinner and in preventing any disappointing or personally off-putting items from showing up on your plate.   At our waiter's advice (he was terrific by the way and I wish I'd gotten his name, tall, glasses...) we went with a 5 course service, which he suggested based on how hungry we were. The brilliant thing about doing this with someone else who also likes to try new food is the ability to share and get to try twice as many fun food options. I was pretty excited to see frogs legs come out. My family is from Kentucky and while you can take the girl out of the woods... The highlights of our meal were definitely the sweetbreads and the kangaroo. The latter being a new one for me. It was surprisingly lean and did not at all taste like chicken. The flavor was nice, light and clean. Desserts were a chocolate crepe for my friend and this lovely little coconut Crème brûlée for me. We were both pleased.   I was happy to learn that Posh has joined a growing group of Scottsdale restaurants offering lower cost (but high value) late night menus including drink specials. I am looking forward to visiting for that soon. Overall the whole experience was just really fun and enjoyable and I am ready to go back as soon as I find someone else willing to try kangaroo.

I have stopped in here several times and have had great experiences all around. This weekend after a dinner at BLT we came in for an after dinner cocktail and were treated extremely well yet again.   I have only eaten off the happy hour menu, which is varied, reasonable and includes some bar favorites. You can't really go wrong with that combination. Happy hour also offers several $6 cocktails - the one with prickly pear and pear vodka is divine - and glasses of wine for $5. The bar staff knows how to mix up anything you can conjure up (I've tested them) and are friendly and attentive.   The lounge is happening several nights a week with live music and in the quiet nook that is Pardise Valley finding a live active bar scene can be a gift.

I just wanted to get the bird poo washed off my car before it started eating into my Everest green metallic paint. The $3 one at the Chevron by my house will remove bird poo, so for $5, it seemed like a reasonable request. After this car wash, the dust was gone, my hood ornament was crooked, and I am pretty sure I left with some new scratches on my trunk. What I also left with was bird poo still stuck to my paint. Apparently it wasn't such a reasonable request after all.

I've been eating lunch at Donna's for about ten months now - since I started working around the corner. Paul, who is generally manning the front counter knows me by name, makes great, honest suggestions and notices when I've had a hair cut - what a guy!   I frequently find I don't really have time to actually take a lunch, but with Donna's a mere two minutes from my office, and free wi-fi in the dining area, I often pack up my laptop for an hour or so midday, enjoy a sandwich and keep up with the ever present flow of emails - or ignore work entirely and write reviews on Yelp - which is what I am doing now. On site review!   This little bakery is a fantastic place to get a sandwich. On my way in to the shop each visit I check out the blackboard at the door, which shows you the daily $3.99 special. For that super low price you get the sandwich of the day (today it was a roast beef with pickles - my favorite is the chicken walnut salad), a bag of chips and a small (refillable) drink. If whatever is on the blackboard doesn't quite spark your interest, the shop has a decent sized list of other cold sandwiches for purchase. The sandwiches are made on fresh bread made by the bakery - which you can purchase and take home for around $2.50 for a (rather large) half loaf.   Beyond making some of the best red velvet cupcakes in town - they are a STEAL at $1.29 (I just paid $4 for one somewhere else), the shop also offers lots of traditional pastries including cinnamon and Danish rolls and a variety of cakes for purchase by the slice or in whole for a party. I love that in addition to these more familiar items Donna's also offers unique items like green tea pastries and bean tarts.   With the service, pricing and great food and pastry selection I plan to keep up my current 3-day-a-week custard bun habit as long as my waistline will allow.

Dinner here was like having a mini-vacation. I don't know what I can say about FnB that hasn't already been shouted from the rooftops.  Pavle and Charleen are the dynamic duo of Old Town. I've been in for dinner several times and can't keep away during late night on the weekends. I look forward to the twitter update every week that lets you in on the menu. It doesn't take long to round up 4-5 people as ready for dinner as I. If you go with 2-3 people sitting at the open bar around the kitchen is really the way to go.   Make a reservation for dinner and let the staff help guide you through the ever changing menu, which includes lot of locally grown produce. The wine list is a true showcase of the wines Arizona has to offer. If you are new to Arizona wineries let the staff guide you there as well, and I promise you will be pleasantly surprised.   I had a macaroni and cheese this past Friday I could live off forever. I don't love lamb generally - but I loved theirs. Save room for dessert, because at FnB it is always worth the extra two miles on the treadmill.

I can't send enough love to these guys. The pub has a homey atmosphere during the day and into happy hour and turns into a rocking party after 9ish on the weekends.   I am a sucker for a good happy hour and this place has possibly the best in Tempe. Where else can you get a $2!! Jameson? They are only $5 regularly, but 4-7 weekdays are a real steal. Also on happy hour are $3 glasses of wine, well drinks (which are made with surprisely decent liquors) and $1 off a great draft selection. I suggest a Murphy's with a splash of Framboise - just a little for the berry flavor or it gets too sweet.   Also on special is the entire appetizer list at half off. You can easily make a meal out of the mussels at $5 or the chicken strips or sausages, which both include a big basket of tasty fries.   The regular menu has a lot of variety and you can't go wrong with any of the "pies", cottage, Guinness, chicken or my personal favorite, the seafood.   Sunday's before 6pm you can also enjoy happy hour pricing on appetizers as well as half priced bottles of wine. The patio is always dog friendly and every first Sunday of the month they now have a Doggy Brunch until 3 - mine loves to split a basket of chicken fingers. I feel pretty good about treating her a little.   Robbie's has a great European cafe society feel to it, and the regulars all know each other's names. We came in for the deals and drinks and stayed because we've been treated like part of the family and not expendable customers.

Well - my love for the Irish at this little Jamo joint just grows stronger all the time.   I recently had occasion to host a private party at RFPH for my dear friend Sam and naturally my home away from home was the best place to play hostess. I had the benefit of still feeling as much at ease as I would have in my real home, without having to cook or clean up after the party.   I worked closely with Anne Marie who made sure every detail of the party was attended to flawlessly. We held our birthday extravaganza in the front "cottage" area, which is the perfect spot for about 25-30 guests for a sit down dinner or a happy hour (done that one too). The pub also has a banquet room and separate bar out back which can be rented out for private functions. Another one of my friends held her wedding reception here and, in addition to having the great food and service you'd hope for at your wedding, it was just plain fun.   Back to our Sunday birthday brunch... The kitchen prepared an Irish breakfast as well as a course of passed hor d'oeuvres of cucumber sandwiches, filet mignon brioche (my favorite) and salmon mousse toasts. For dessert I was able to bring in special cake for the party and the kitchen added an accompaniment of fresh strawberries and creme (brilliant). Everything came out well timed and executed start to finish.   Lucky for us, Sunday afternoons now offer live jazz - which was a great bonus for the party atmosphere. I don't know if we should still be calling it a brunch - those usually don't last for 9 hours... but we had a great time.

This is one of those "I don't really get all the positive reviews" kinds of reviews.   This hotel is pretty and shiny and newish, but little cheesy/eighties with the red and the black and the glittery bits. The entire property is basically one big nightclub with beds. I know you come across some degree of this in every Vegas property with a casino; but, this was to the nth degree of anything I have experienced in a long history of successful gambling/bing drinking/gourgingtrips to the city.   We had called and requested a certain room type days in advance, then again called to confirm that morning of travel and were assured it would not be a problem. But, upon check-in, were advised the room was not available. The room we were placed in was fine, but situated directly above the indoor/outdoor nightclub. You don't really sleep that much in Vegas anyway, but at 14 floors above the lounge I really wouldn't expect the party to be penetrating my walls from 6am to 4am. Don't most people stay in bed past at least 9am in Viva anyway?  The second night the hotel did move us, as requested, to the quieter side of the building, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. If I had some way to pipe the music up from the fountains to my room, I probably would have spent the whole weekend on the balcony. One very nice thing about the rooms was the access to a decent sized patio, which is hard to find anywhere in Las Vegas.   Our second room was as attractive as the bellman that moved us into it. The rooms are contemporary, in a 'this was chic in 1985 is cool again white on white kind of way'. The rooms had two well defined areas, one for sleeping and one for lounging, as well as a nice sized bathroom with Bigelow amenities. I liked the fact that each room had lots of art and culture related books, although, one of the big picture books was sticky. Hotel+Vegas+Sticky Picture Book = Idontwannaknow.   The bottom line for me is that I am not now, nor have I ever been a club girl. The Cosmopolitan is made for the club guys and girls of the world. And, with the $350 price tag on a holiday weekend, your average club guys and girls were packing themselves like sardines in to their double occupancy rooms so they could still afford their Red Bull & vodka cocktails. On several occasions we had to wait times to get up and down the elevators because they were so overly full. The civil engineer who approved that design should stick to single floor establishments.   The hotel was absolutely overrun with hammered broads in cheap heels and cheaper dresses (I know guys - dream come true) and douchey dudes in stripey shirts. I walked outside one night to a waiting car, on our way out to a nice dinner, and stepped directly into gum, which essentially ruined my (not cheap) shoes. I could go on for days, but I think "gum spitting crowd" and a staff who doesn't care to clean it up pretty much sums up my experience here.

This is an excellent place to watch a game. If I had only been there to watch a game I might give this place about 4 stars, but I'd had a long day, wanted to watch a game and unwind with a couple glasses of wine and some dinner.  I stopped in recently with a friend when  in the area and Roka seemed less than lively. Our guess that this place might be more lively was perhaps correct, in that it had 6 people at the bar rather than 4 and had about 30 flat screen TV's running baseball games and various other sporting events. We chose to sit at the bar, because I always think you get better service there and the restaurant itself was pretty slow at 730 on a weeknight. That thing about better service didn't really hold up here as it seemed out bartender was also handling issues around the restaurant and after I finished my first glass of wine the glass sat empty for quite some time before someone came by to see about a refill. I will tolerate just about anything as long as I have a cocktail in front of me, and as pouring drinks is the primary function of a bartender this was more than slightly annoying.   We ordered the ahi appetizer for a starter (I know I should probably be slapped for even ordering something like this in a sports bar). I had a couple bites and they were okay, but parts of the fish were actually starting to grey, which can't be a good sign. For dinner we had the salmon and a flatbread.   Both the bartenders on duty raved about the flatbreads. I believe they have never eaten a flatbread anywhere else or they probably would stop raving about these. It was a relatively flavorless bread, which was not at all crisp on the bottom or the edges, lightly topped with cheese, sauce and some bits of chicken. It was edible as a food dish, but the part I found off putting was that the bread seemed to be taking on the flavor of the wooden paddle it was served upon. Yes, I know you can cook bread over wood and it will take on the wood flavor, but I am 99% sure this was coming off the wooden serving board. I actually took most of it home and the taste went away by the next day and the whole thing was well served by about 5 minutes in the toaster oven.    The salmon was also very very okay. The best thing I  think we ate was the broccoli side that came out with the fish. They were sharp green, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fish was kind of overdone and uninteresting. I feel like maybe this place should go to a smaller menu to be able to have more consistency with preparation.

I recently had the opportunity to check out Johnny Fox's Public House during a pre-opening/soft opening event. Having never visited during its previous incarnation I didn't know what to expect, but was immediately impressed by the care taken to design the exterior, which provided an inviting facade evoking the warmth and charm of an Irish village.   The entryway to the restaurant is equally inviting and as you move from room to room you are greeted by unique niches and details one usually sees only in an older establishment. The wood floors were polished to a high shine to welcome the new visitors. I was particularly taken with the bar off the entry which provides as a certain coziness in contrast to the high energy main dining room.   The bar has an impressive selection of beers, Irish, craft and your basic American lagers. I was taken by the scotch list (as per usually) and was happy to see some old favorites and a broad range of choices in blends and single malts.   On this particular occasion we were served Irish classics such as corned beef and fish and chips, which were just as you'd expect. I was impressed by the fresh oysters and smoked salmon. As I understand the menu will place an emphasis on fresh seafood and I am looking forward to a second visit to try out more of the options the kitchen has to offer and to work my way through the whiskey list soon.

If I were just talking bagels here we'd be at a 5 star. This place has some of the tastiest bagels I've come across here in the valley and they are all made fresh on premises using the old NY boil and bake. The Bagel Man himself seems to be working as a jack of all trades up front serving customer and working the bakery.   I was pretty impressed that the selection of bagels included some classics like salt (my favorite) and pumpernickel rye along with some unusual recipes including walnut multi grain (will be trying this) and chocolate chip.   My gourmet lunch sandwich ingredients couldn't really improve upon the perfectly cooked salt bagel they were placed upon. The sandwiches are piled with quality deli meats and cheeses and the 'gourmet list' included a choice of macaroni salad, chips or potato salad all for $5.50. I tried the macaroni salad, which was the  and it was very okay, also heavy on the mayo and light on flavor.  I am pretty happy to have another friendly option for breakfast around the office and will back for more salt bagels as well as to try the lox soon.

Perusing the menu of this upscale Mexican restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter I was initially impressed by the variety and selection of ingredients. I was then highly amused when I read the description around the ceviche indicating it was made with fresh sashimi grade "local fish". We live in the desert. A big one. If they are using fresh "local" fish it would have to be from Tempe Town Lake or the Arizona Canal. And I dunno about you, but I ain't eating that - cooked even. I did find out later the company originates out of California and it appears they just reprinted the menus and/or got a bulk deal and didn't update it for the Scottsdale location. Detail oriented.   The menu does offer lots of hearty brunch options and a wide variety of 'specialty' tacos. The waitress initially brought out some large corn chip type things, dusted with paprika and several accoutrements. I don't eat corn, but tried a couple of the items that came along with the chips (because for some reason she really talked this stuff up, like as in one of those awkward "why is my waitress still talking" kind of talked it up. There was nothing worth having talked my ear off about. Anyway, when she stopped talking, she walked away, without taking a drink order. When I did finally see her again, I ordered a mimosa, which showed up quite some time later. The bar was dead and the restaurant wasn't that full, so I am not really sure what could take so long about putting orange juice and bubbly wine in a glass. I can forgive a lot if someone keeps my cocktail full; this continued to be a challenge throughout lunch.   When the gal came back to ask for our orders and whether we had questions, I had two. One, are the tacos all on corn, or can they be made on flour; and, which items on the menu have a little bit of a kick or heat to them. The first question was responded to with, "No. Traditionally Mexican tacos are made on corn tortillas," which was put to me in the same tone of voice my mother uses when she can't believe what just came out of my mouth.   BEGIN RANT:   "Traditionally" not ALL tacos are made on corn tortillas. In Oaxaca, in Central Mexico, yes, but in Sonora or down the Baja the locals very often utilize flour tortillas. This place professes to be all about Baja style food and in all my times up and down in the region I have actually never had one Mexican, in a restaurant, in a road side stand or otherwise, tell me they couldn't make whatever I asked for on a flour tortilla. Anyway, a simple "No, I'm sorry, we don't use flour tortillas," or "No. But let me suggest..." would have sufficed, rather than providing me with a snotty response as to why this "authentic Mexican cantina" located in one of the most affluent shopping centers in all of Scottsdale, without one non-white person to be seen, can't be bothered with catering to the masses. I am pretty sure 98% of my annoyance here was in the delivery. If you don't like being nice to people, you probably shouldn't be working for tips.   END RANT.  My next question, as to whether any items on the menu had green chiles or any heat behind them and the waitress pointed out a taco (see above) I had already indicated I wasn't interested in and then reminded me about the weak sauce on the table that had come out with the much hyped corn ships. I asked her again later if they had anything hotter (yes I am one of those people) and she mumbled something and pointed to this stuff on the table AND WALKED AWAY, again without offering another option or suggestion.  I gave up on the Mexican food and ordered a crab cakes benedict off the brunch menu. The good news here is that the crab cakes were amazing, and the eggs cooked perfectly. And you know, authentic Mexican restaurants are known for their crab cakes benedict. They pair this (I guess to Mexican it up) with refried black beans, but they made absolutely no sense with the dish as a whole, and weren't very flavorful. I left them on the plate virtually untouched, along with the (very Mexican) fried bacon laid on top of them. My lunch date ordered a couple of the $7-8 individual tacos. He was happy and they had good flavor and nice elements. So that's all swell. I just don't get the price. I have no problem with expense, if the purchase is worth it. I think my breakfast was $18, but for crab cakes benedict, which is on par with what I would expect.   I realize most of this review has to do with service, but overall our waitress was not only unprofessional and not helpful, but she was kind of rude. Maybe she should spend a little time working in an actual "authentic" Mexican cantina, where they would expect that she provide better customer service for a $1 taco than we received here for a $60 lunch.

My new office happens to be within a stone's throw of some of the best little Mexican joints in town. Due to this, I have gained about 4 pounds in the last two months and have eaten an obscene number of breakfast burritos. I like my chorizo burros, but my office mates prefer more Americanized ingredients like bacon and ham - which is why we generally wind up ordering from Dora's - something for everyone!  Due to its proximity, speed and reasonable prices, we have recently started ordering lunch from Dora's. The tacos and lunch burritos are some of the best in the area, and my co-worker swears they have the best green chile around - which the owner told me they make fresh in house, and you can buy in a large side to go. Since I have been overindulging in Mexican food of late I decided to try the chicken gyro for lunch on my last visit. They were out of chicken so I went ahead and ordered the lamb, against my better judgment. The gyro was well made, on a super fresh pita, but the lamb just wasn't my thing. They also offer a Greek Salad for $5.95... so as I prepare for a couple upcoming weddings that may be my next order.   The 'restaurant' is in the back of a market called "Minute Liquor" so you can pick up pretty much any sort of beverage you'd like to go with your meal. Cervesa anyone? It may seem a little strange to find a dining establishment located in the back of a liquor store, but the neighborhood is rife with these little combo shops and the kitchen is clean and the food is good and economical, so I can navigate the aisles of beer and chips in the mini-market to the back of the tiny shop for my lunch.

I've been seeing Stephen for my haircuts and salon services for about eight years now, which is officially longer than any relationship I've ever had. It was exciting news to find out that he'd ventured out to open his own space, which is tucked inside the Moda Fina Studios on Camelback. There's nothing worse than finding out your hair stylist has moved to a new salon, so the side benefit of this opening, is that I'll always know where to find him.   The salon features exclusive Kevin Murphy hair products, a comfortable, chic space and the best hair guy in town. Love it.
