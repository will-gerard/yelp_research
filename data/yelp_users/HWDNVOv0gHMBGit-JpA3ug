I came in here to better understand my benefits and possibly make an appointment. The dark haired girl at the front desk was of no help! Being that I am still not familiar with the services here in Arizona they just lost what could have been a great and loyal customer. If you are looking for assistance and aren't sure what your insurance benefits will offer, this location is not the place to go. To top it off they don't  special order frames..

Horrible pharmacy service.. The girl working didn't even greet me and just took the prescription from my hand. I keep going back because rewards deals are great and they are open 24 hours. They need to improve on their customer service skills.

The only reason this establishment gets one star is for the food being edible. It took us 15 minutes to receive our food and only after I went to check to see what took so long. The workers were busy talking and had no remorse for them forgetting our order. The Mexican manager starts laughing when I walk away and thinks it's a total joke. I will never return!

I come in here often and buy all my ammo and gun supplies. Therefore we spend quite a bit of money on a monthly basis. To have a cashier who has the worst attitude and the behavior of a child made me regret even coming here. They should not treat customers this way let alone a loyal customer who shops in your store often. The cashiers name is Amanda!!! If she does not like her job then she should find a new one. I've never had such a bad experience until today!!

Walked into the store and was greeted with a very short hello by two young females. I spent a couple minutes trying to find my product and was offered no help. These two girls continued to gossip at the front counter not even acknowledging that I was even there. I have always been offered assistance at every Sallys I go to. Horrible customer service!!!

This was my first time here..Food was delicious and the service was exceptional. (Try there Jalapeno Margarita, YUM!) A manager even came around and greeted tables. Now that's what I call COSTUMER SERVICE!! Definitely coming back!!!

Upon walking into this particular Subway it didn't look very clean. Food on floors and tables not wiped down. I stood in line for 5 minutes and watched the workers gawking at me in an uncomfortable way, while whispering to each other. I walked right out and went next door to Senior Taco. Never going to that disgusting Subway again.

I absolutely will not go to anyone else to get my hair done besides Auggie. He does and amazing job and is very professional. I love to change my hair color and style quite often and he perfects it every time!!! He recently put in extensions and colored it violet.  Let me tell you, he really outdid himself. It came out gorgeous!!!
