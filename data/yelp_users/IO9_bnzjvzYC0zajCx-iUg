Bottom line: this place is pretty gross.  We went for the $5.99 lunch buffet - well you can say: "you got what you paid for"; but in reality it was barely worth $0.99. First off, the buffet has 10 entrees, but when we went, only 3 entrees were replenished, the rest sat there empty the whole time! at 1pm! So basically I could try spring rolls, fried chicken, and rice... for the $5.99. And it was not good. At all. The entire place is pretty damn filthy. Last time I had lunch here was in 2000, and it doesn't look like they have cleaned since. Whatever you do, don't look under the table! The service was not good either. Not friendly or welcome, just point to a table and mutter some words. It's pretty obvious the owners also operate the place, so at least you save some money because tipping is inappropriate when the owners are also the staff (you are just giving them free money at that point).  We examined the buffet and asked, before deciding to stay, if it was going to be replenished soon. Our server just pointed at the buffet and nodded. ok? I guess that means yes. Well apparently it meant no. My friend asked her: "What are the entrees?"  she points, again, and just says "5.99".  Here is the convo: "What are the entrees today?" "5.99" "Yes, but what will the food items be when you replenish them?" "buffet over there" "Yes, we see that, but what do we get for $5.99?" "Food at buffet" "Yes, but there is nothing there, so we don't know what we'll be eating when you bring out the food. What are you going to serve?" "5.99" No joke. My friend just got up and left. My other friend and I made the poor decision of staying. Well needless to say, we never found out what the other food was going to be - though I assume based on what was left in the bottom of the pans it was going to be some brown slop. The spring roll tasted like a frozen one that was defrosted and served. The rice was so rock hard I had to spit it out. The fried chicken was just ok.  The MSG coma hit us about 20 mins after leaving. That food is really poor quality. So.... filthy restaurant, unfriendly service, empty buffet, bad food....  $5.99 all you can eat! lol I cannot recommend this place to anyone other than transients and trailer trash. Which brings up the next topic: the other patrons. We did get some entertainment value from the other crazy patrons. They must have some real characters wander off the street into this place. One guy came in and was yelling at himself, then yelled at the buffet food, then yelled at other patrons, then had a full meltdown and stormed out of the place. 10 mins later he comes and sits down, and apparently is friendly with the owners. LOL. and he had a mysterious animal in a kennel under his table. That was allowed. and nobody asked him to stop being weird with other customers and settle down. My assumption is that this is the norm for this place, the clientele isn't exactly.... top shelf.  Best part? they have a sign that says "2012 Best of Phoenix - Best Chinese Restaurant"..... I stared at it... it was incredulous. This must be a hoax. That made me laugh because it was just so ridiculous. You just walk into the place and you know for a fact that it is NOT best of anything. Ever.  UPDATE: within a few hours of dining there, I had horrible explosive diarrhea.  New Hong Kong is not for the faint of stomach.

Very unfriendly service. We were still in the middle of our dinner, and it was about 15 minutes before closing and they just turned off the lights and stood at the door. We had to leave with our dinner still in our hands and finish outside on the street!  They couldn't be bothered to wait at least 10 more minutes for a customer to finish their meal. It was really inconsiderate - they were in such a rush to leave; it doesn't seem like they care about their guests or the business.  Btw the pizza was average, nothing special. You can tell that they don't put their hearts into the food - they just go through the motions and look miserable. A VERY weak experience.   And the place is absolutely filthy and decaying. I felt bad for some of the cool sports memorabilia that was on the wall - torn and stained. gross and sad. After 16 years in business, this place needs a reboot really bad.

Great local sports hangout! For a sports bar, I give Arena 4 stars; as a restaurant it would be 3 stars. So I went there as a group of 6 to watch NHL playoffs. For some reason I thought this was a newer place, but turns out it's a rather old local neighborhood hangout, and features an OTB. The bar/otb section was pretty dark and very loud (it was Thursday night), so we opted for the dining room. Our server was VERY friendly and accommodating - she got us a big table, and switched the TV to the Blues-Wild game for us - which is why we were there. As far as a place to watch the game, the dining room was just ok - decent view of tv, but no sound at all. The atmosphere in that room was more for dinner than watching a sports game, but since its a sports bar we didn't feel awkward cheering for our team out loud. The OTB half of the place is much better suited to games etc, but on that night we wanted a little peace to be able to focus on the game. We ended up ordering a few beers, potato skins, a hamburger, 1lb of wings in secret sauce, and 2 large pepperoni pizzas. My friend had the burger and said it was good; I was able to try everything else. Gotta say, the potato skins may be the best I have EVER had. They were nice and crispy all around, and covered in lots of bacon - most places barely put a few bacon bits and serve the skins rather mushy, but not Arena. Their skins were AMAZING. I would definitely order them again. The wings were decent - typical sportsbar chicken wings; about 10 pieces made up a 1lb order. They were nice and crispy and the "secret sauce" was actually really good - not too spicy or sweet, just perfectly balanced. The pizza was good too, but my main gripe was the use of cornmeal on the bottom. I HATE it when pizzerias use cornmeal - that is pizza blasphemy! most places do it just so the pizza comes out of the oven easier - that is just lazy pizza skills. I've never thought that cornmeal adds a good taste to pizza, and it makes it messy. Without the cornmeal, I'd say the pizza was a good thin crust foldable NY style.... but as is, the pizza is average and just a hair above mediocre, because of the cornmeal. uggh.  So, for a sports bar where one would go to watch games like NHL playoffs, or bet on horses, or play bar trivia with the DJ - Arena is a good local hangout, nothing special, but effectively fulfills expectations (which should never be too high with sports bars). With lots of TVs, and games like billiards and darts etc... Arena is a fun place where you can go with friends or even just go alone if you're bored at home. It's pretty divey, but has a local neighborhood vibe that keeps it friendly. The food is not the best, but a cut-above-average for a bar - the potato skins are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and the wings and pizza are recommended, but with reservations. The service was excellent, and the prices were quite reasonable for the location and type of venue. You need a place to go and watch the game and devour some food? Arena is probably a very good bet - not fancy or gourmet, but local and friendly.

Best local convenience store in the valley! If you live in North Scottsdale, this should be your go-to place. Run by a family from Detroit, this store is one of those old-school places where everybody knows everyone's names; even when I don't go so often, they still remember my name at the counter! Tell me.... is there any other convenience store where they actually know your name when you walk in??? no. there is only one place, and this is it. The service here is absolutely amazing - you will walk out every single time with a smile on your face. I actually look forward to going there sometimes, if only to get a soda or lottery ticket, just because of the friendly ambiance. Now to more important things: the sandwiches. You would never expect this place, based on the outside appearance, to have one of the very best delis in town. They have a rather large sandwich menu, and use only Boar's Head meats and cheeses. Best part - they bake their own bread daily and omg it is so good! Their breakfast croissants are amongst the best I have ever had (so flakey and buttery!) and their sub rolls are just excellent. Sometimes I stop by to just get some sub rolls, if I have leftovers at home to make sammys with. The three sandwiches I recommend the most are the: beefstrami (hot beef and pastrami melt, mmmm), chicken Caesar (it's light and refreshing), and my personal fav - The Shane Doan. Named after the legendary Phoenix Coyotes captain, who is a regular at the store (he often stops by with Mike Smith and Kurt Warner even!), the sandwich that bears his name used to be "the upside down roast beef"... basically a beef melt. I always add a piece of cheese to it, and I love how they prepare it and top it with fresh green pepper and mustard. It really is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  I can't recommend this store enough - and that is solely based on the owners, as people and as businessmen - they really nailed it when it comes to neighbourhood convenience. Go for a sandwich and I guarantee you will be hooked. Tell them Istvan sent you and say hi to Marty for me!

I'm a huge pizza snob and the buck stops here. The hype is for real - this may be the single best pizza made in the entire US of A.  I would put Bianco's in my top 3 all time, along with Regina's Pizzeria in the North End of Boston. It is THAT good.   Not much more needs to be said - I've been willing to wait almost 2 hours to be seated there and was not disappointed one bit.  My favourite has the smoked salami and pistachios on it. It is divine. This place deserves the James Beard award year after year. Worth every penny, worth every minute. Also this review is specifically for this location, the original one downtown.

I love this place! One of the more unique culinary concepts I have ever encountered -  a brash fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisines. And wow, is it ever tasty! So we were watching the TripleD show on Food Network and Chino Bandido was featured - the moment we were aware that this place was within driving distance, we hopped in the car and headed there; may have arrived before the show even ended! From what I saw, I just had to try it out; and now we have a new favourite eatery. First the negative - why I can't give a full 5 stars. The interior of the restaurant blends well with the ghetto neighbourhood - the place is a filthy dive! While I typically enjoy most dives, my only real gripe was that the tables were so unclean that I had to make a place-mat with the paper napkins so that my cutlery would touch a clean surface. The interior definitely activated my OCD. I wouldn't be surprised if some first-timers simply walked out after looking around the dining area - it has the pleasantness of a prison lunchroom. I will say that one aspect I liked was that the condiment/cutlery station included chopsticks and Chinese mustard. A big plus for me.  But...once you taste the food, the concerns of the divey interior are washed away with gastronomical gratification. The ordering process can seem daunting at first - they have a sheet you fill out and it can get quite complicated. Basically they offer two sizes of "rice bowls" - which is basically a bowl that they fill with:  different types of fried rice, two types of Mexican beans, and your choice of entree meat. I believe they have about 15 different entree selections, from chicken to pork to beef and some are Chinese (like Emerald Chicken) and some are Mexican (like Beef Machaca). The larger combination bowl allows you to select 2 different entree items for $8. You can just get everything in a bowl, or you can make it either a burrito or quesadilla (they have their own tortilla recipe!), or combine it within the rice bowl itself. Sounds complicated, but once you try it it will seem simple the next time you go, My wife got: plain rice in a bowl with black beans, Jen Red Pork, and Chile Relleno. She said that it may just be the best chile relleno she has ever had! We both definitely recommend the black beans over the refried beans. I got:  Pork Fried Rice bowl, with refried beans, a Chinese BBQ Pork burrito, and also the Jen Red Pork.  The pork fried rice was great - they do great things with pork there. Again, I would recommend the black beans over the refried beans. The Chinese BBQ Pork tasted good, but it was bit too fatty - but wrapped in a tortilla as a burrito, it was still pretty darn fantastic. And then the Jen Red Pork - wow! so good. Perfectly crispy and bite-sized for chopstick use, with just the right amount of heat behind it. I absolutely loved it, and would order it again and again. Word on the street is that the Jade Red Chicken is the most popular item - will definitely have to try that one next time, and also perhaps try one of their quesadillas.  On a sad note - I am disappointed that they don't offer egg rolls and tacos!  So 5 stars for the food - loved the pork fried rice, the black beans, the Jen Red pork, and the tortillas. SO YUMMY.  Decent value also - for $8 you get a good portion of food. Not enough to take any home after, but enough to satisfy and get your $8 worth.  I am tempted to ignore the restaurant conditions and just give 5 stars for the food, but I don't think that's fair to a reader who is looking for a nice sit-down meal - you must be willing to accept the slightly ghetto conditions. But the food is worth it. What a terrific concept and the execution equally matches the idea.

I have never been to a Pita Jungle location to dine before; I understand it is quite a popular place.  That being said - I had take out from there for the first time ever. I order the Gyro Pita. and it really sucked!  Pros: it is pretty large and hefty, and the pita holds together. Surprisingly not a sloppy sandwich. The veggie toppings seemed pretty fresh and were crispy. Pickles are an odd thing to add to a gyro, but it wasn't bad.  Cons: its not real or fresh gyro meat. It is that processed compressed crap; even worse, it looks like the pre-sliced frozen kind!  Totally not acceptable for a restaurant and at that price. Also, the sandwich ended up having 1 flavor - SALT.  It just tasted crazy salty.   So based on the Gyro Pita, this place is a total fail. Fake processed frozen salty gyro meat. That's all. A waste of money for what is basically a fast-food quality sandwich.

92nd St Cafe is a local sports bar & grill in North Scottsdale. As a sports bar, I could easily give it 4 stars - great atmosphere, sports on many TV's, and the fans seemed to be having fun; definitely seems like a place that locals have been going to for a long time. However, we went there to dine, and as a restaurant we had a 2 star experience, at best. First off, the place is nice - much nicer than your average sports bar. It has a nice Scottsdale classy feel, without being snobby - more traditional pub atmosphere than anything else. It's a nice place, and has a fun adult vibe. Nobody greeted us when we walked in and we sat ourselves at a booth and had to wait a while for anyone to acknowledge us - we went on a Sunday afternoon, and though the place was busy, it was certainly not full. Most people were just ordering beer and watching football, we seemed to be the only actual "diners" there, and received kinda lackluster service for having paid over $50 for a lunch for two (with a coupon also!). our food items: I got the crock of french onion soup. At first it was pretty good - nice melted cheese over a good smelling broth. but once I got into the soup itself, it was a DISASTER. Whoever cut the onions was completely incompetent. there were giant pieces of onion in the soup, so large they were inedible and it was rather gross. I had to pull them out and place them off to the side, it looked disgusting. For the cook to mess up the onions in an onion soup is rather unforgivable. French Onion Soup gets 1 star. The next two items: well when they were served, there were nothing like the description on the menu. I got something called a Bar Steak - don't ever order it. It was cubed beef stew in an awful and diluted wine/garlic "sauce". The menu did NOT describe it also smothered in mushrooms - I cannot eat mushrooms and was pretty annoyed that mushrooms were the main ingredient of the dish, despite not being mentioned on the menu. After having to removed the mushrooms (which joined the pile of giant slices of onions), I proceeded to try what was really chewy and flavorless cubes of beef. This appetizer is a complete fail - not only was it nothing like the menu description, it was rather disgusting and unappetizing. For $12 I recommend that you NEVER order it. Again, a 1 star rating for the Bar Steak. My main entree was the Hawaiian Princess salad for $10+.  Again, NOTHING like the description on the menu. I received a plate that had two ice-cream-sized scoops of tuna and chicken salad, surround by really large pieces of melon and pineapple and a few oranges. There were no greens to mix the salad with. The menu described a dressing, that I did not receive - when I asked for it, the waitress said there was no dressing for that salad; when I mentioned that the menu indicates a dressing, she shrugged and said it was wrong. I was extremely disappointed that my salad was essentially a melon fruit plate. The tuna and chicken salad were completely bland, I couldn't taste any seasoning in them. This was a terrible entree choice on my part. And again, like the onion soup and beef stew app, this salad "entree" is a 1 star item.  My wife ordered the bowl of chili. Out of everything we ordered, that was the best. It was not great by any means, but it wasn't too bad either. Tasted rather generic, like it came out of a can. I guess we were so disappointed with the other items, we ate the entire bowl of chili out of desperation to have something edible and decent. She also got the tuna melt and was not impressed. The tuna again was bland and unseasoned. The rest of the sandwich was very forgettable For $10, it gets 1 star also.  Maybe we just happened to order the worst items on the menu, but for the money we spent, that was a terrible Sunday lunch. The service was not memorable or helpful, the food was either bland or just plain bad, and it was horrible value for the money. The silver lining? probably a great place to have a few beers and watch a game, however I would not recommend it as a local dining option, unless you get drunk first at the bar and don't really care what is served in front of you....

A wonderful local taco shop with a distinct hippy/geeky hybrid vibe! You will have no trouble finding this place, it really stands out on Camelback with its funky design - look for the VW bus and a beach-style patio; inside you will find comic books and a cool figurine of Spock. But onto more important things - food & service!  Service - can't complain. It's always the same two people, and the girl who takes orders is really friendly and cool. I don't normally use words like "cool" in reviews, but here it is apt. This place is trendy and hip, without being hipster and tacky. The staff just comes off as the type of people you would be friends with and hang out with. It's counter service, so you really can't ask for more than a friendly intelligent face behind the counter, and Two Hippies are super rad people!  The food: I've sampled the menu, having the burritos, nachos, tacos etc... They were all good, but there is really one item that keeps me coming back time after time: the fried fish taco. One of the best I have ever had in my life. That good.  For about $3 you get a huge piece of nice fried fish, and the toppings are perfectly balanced with the fish. The sauce is tasty - no tartar on this.  While I recommend trying anything on the menu (caveat - the nachos were really disappointing)... I feel that the fried fish taco is a MUST HAVE. They are highly addictive, and you will forget you are not in San Diego or Puerto Penasco..... If you want to go to a really fun place, with super cool staff, and the best fish taco you will have in Phoenix.... Two Hippies on Camelback is a treasure to be discovered!

One of the better pizzas around, easily top 10 in Phoenix, and arguably top 5. Not as good as Bianco's though.  Been there twice for lunch and the service was horrendously slow. From being seated to getting our food, was about an hour. Doesn't exactly make you want to come back when you only have a short time for lunch during the workweek; its not like Bianco's where you know you have to wait 1+ hour to get a table, we were seated immediately....and then our waiter disappeared.  But the pizza will not disappoint. Also had the short rib sandwich which was quite delicious - next time I must ask for no jalapeno, because it was covered in them and so spicy on the tongue that it didn't balance well with the very tender meat and the flavours I knew were there but could not savor.  Great pizza, beautiful restaurant, poor service.  Recommended to pizza snobs who have time to take an extra long lunch - I will return then when it's more convenient.

For the birds!  Zinburger is one of those hip trendy places that is part of the so-called Burger Revolution, and sits right in the middle of the area of Phoenix that is known as Hamburger Row. What does this mean? Basically that it's a restaurant that can charge you $12 for a hamburger. Have the culinary arts "progressed" to the point that we know think of a burger as a gastronomical adventure and worth more than $6-7??? that is NUTS. Its a burger, get over yourselves pseudo-foodies.  Well I gave it a try, because our party wanted to go there. Since you don't get a side with your entree, I found it odd that they served it on a large plate that was meant for more than 1 item. The burger looked pretty lonely on that big plate with nothing else on it.  Right off the bat, they got my order wrong - I asked for medium-well and it arrived totally rare. That is a big turnoff for me - either someone doesn't listen or the cook is just incompetent. I told the server and he just took the plate away; someone else, I assume a manager came out with another burger, cooked to order, in like 1 minute. That was odd, they must have given me someone else's. He was apologetic, but only enough to perform his duties without actually showing that it matters if they can cook their burgers properly or not. This tells me it happens often, and they are used to it.  Now the burger itself - the applewood smoke bacon tasted only of cured salt. In fact, it gave the entire burger nothing but this massive salt taste. It was like a sodium megabomb with none of that real bacon flavour, just the curing. The rest of the burger was a big soggy mess... the bun was way too small and pretty much disintegrated before I got halfway through. In the end I was basically just eating bits of the patties covered in the condiments, and not actually holding a burger in my hand. It all just felt and tasted wrong. As a lover of classic American hamburgers, to me this place is for birds. Waste your money on something you can barely eat half of, because you are in a hip scene. BS. Your wealthy grandmother may like it, but it's not a place for full-blooded American men who want a satisfying hamburger, even one that is more fancy than your average burger joint. Personally, if I am going that route, I will stick to Delux Burger, because there you can actually taste the quality you are overpaying for! That is a delicious hamburger that does not disappoint, unlike Zinburger which I cannot recommend to another man and look him in the eye with no shame.

Pretty much the smallest, skimpiest sandwich you can spend $9 on. Menu and service is fine, but you do NOT get what you paid for. My sandwich literally has 1 piece of ham on it. 1 piece, folded over to look like more than what it is. The red onion on it was cut at like a 1/2 inch thickness, again probably to make it look bigger than it really is. So $9 for 1 slice of ham and giant onion, with lettuce and tomato. Also - never order the hamburgers... the menu makes them sound delicious... but turns out they just nuke frozen patties and put them on buns. Don't do it! Being inside a corporate center, I get it that they can prey on workers who don't have time to leave the property to eat. I didn't have a choice today and opted to waste $9 instead of not eating at all. This is a terrible lunch option, if you have other options. The store itself is fine, and the staff is really nice. But the value for what you get is awful. Great snack for a rich CEO, disappointing and costly lunch for a working schmoe.

A den of used car salesmen and liars! Do NOT ever shop here. I received two emails directly from Verizon informing me of a great deal that my specific account was now eligible for as an upgrade, along with a trade-in.  We went to this store because it's corporate and the salesman assigned to us was not only a douche, he flat out lied to us. Actually told me that the promo was not available and that the email and the mailer I received were false. "So Verizon sends me bullshit promos?" "Yes - you don't understand how this works." "Ok, so it works like this - you send me a promo to get me to come to the store just so you can sell me something full price with no discount?" ... he shrugged and wagged his head with a yes. WTF.  I was so mad at wasting my time waiting there that I didn't even care to get the manager and call this guy out on his sales scam technique. Yeah ok, you offer me $400 off, but I'll just ignore that and give you $700 for a phone anyways.. because I am as dumb as you think I am, or hope I am.  Since when did selling cell phones literally become a used-car racket? The balls of this guy to stand there in the store run by the corporation and flat out lie to the customers. Well I went home and called the 800# on the email, and connected with sales and the guy on the phone IMMEDIATELY hooked me up with a brand new phone...$400 off... as the promo promised! wow they kept their word. I told him about the experience at the store and he said that's not uncommon at that location - they make more sales off the phone than at the actual location because they hire scumbag salesmen who refuse to honor Verizon's corporate offers so they can make a bigger commission.  I will NEVER go this or any Verizon store again. Doing this over the phone with corporate directly, was supremely more convenient, efficient, and affordable. Gave me the deal I wanted, and I got the phone sent to me free overnight. Salesman on the phone -A+. Salesman at this store location F- AVOID THESE SCUMBAG SCAM ARTISTS AT ALL COSTS. They will lie to your face.  Rant over.

Some of the best gourmet burgers around, made and served by people who care. We've heard of Rehab Burger Therapy for a while now, and finally got a chance to try it out. Wow! The service and the food are absolutely top notch.  We went on a Sunday night and parking was not a big issue - there is a large free lot right next door. Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Rehab gives off a relaxing beach vibe with the décor - it's like a cantina in Montego Bay that serves hamburgers unlike any you've had before. Great laid-back ambiance that is enhanced by the friendliness and approachability of the staff. The place is not that big, but the table arrangements are so that you never feel cramped, there is room for everyone to be comfortable. We told the hostess it was our first time, and they just jumped at the opportunity to treat us like VIP's - even the owner, a super cool dude named Wiley stopped by to say hello. You can tell this is a place where management truly cares about every guest that walks through the door. It's not a corporate or franchise atmosphere - it's a local family-style atmosphere, where you feel like they care more about you as the diner, than just getting you to pay the check. This is rare in today's fast-paced high-turnover restaurant industry, and it sets Rehab apart from the others. Our server, who was very attentive and funny, took our orders promptly and got us our beers really fast. We enjoyed the funny stories he told us, especially about some guy who ordered 3 10oz patties and topped that burger off with pulled pork & a fried egg and ate the whole thing! Yikes! While I will never order anything like that, I wasn't quite prepared for the monstrous sized portions you get here. While the prices are in the $10-15 range for the burgers, you definitely get value for your money. We started with some yummy appetizers - chicken wings and "pig wings". The chicken wings were the smaller sportsbar variety but they were nice and crispy with a delicious spicy pineapple bbq sauce. I like that the sauce was more of a zesty kick than a burn-your-mouth hot wing. It was perfectly balanced. The pig wings are basically bone-in pork knuckles and are out of this world! The meat was incredibly tender and tasty. We also got a side of the pineapple teriyaki aioli, which was fantastic. I would definitely order those again without thinking twice.  My girlfriend ordered the Chili burger - it was cooked medium as she asked, and she loved it. While I'm not a chiliburger guy, I tried a spoonful of the just the chili and it was quite good, perfectly seasoned. I ordered the Mac Gnarly burger, medium well and it arrived cooked-to-order (this is important as so many places either under or over cook their patties), and omg this thing was a MONSTER. It was two 5 oz patties, with a bun in the middle too, smothered in aged cheddar & 1000 island dressing. Seriously the largest burger I have ever seen in my life - it was a masterpiece. You'd think this was a fork n knife meal, but being the experienced burger eater that I am, I was able to eat most of it with my two hands. I cannot overemphasize how hugely massive and tasty this burger was. Definitely one of the best I've had. Wow factor x1000.  The dessert menu has 1 item, and after tasting the pot brownie, they don't need anything else. This was a supremely decadent and carefully prepared delicacy. As stuffed as I was after the Mac Gnarly, this brownie was just too darn good to let my girlfriend eat alone! Needless to say, we went home absolutely satisfied with our meal.  I highly recommend Rehab Burger Therapy - the quality of the food, the value for the money paid, the quality of service, and the fun relaxing ambiance make this one of the best burger joints in the Southwest. No surprise they keep racking up the awards! When you go...arrive hungry!

I think Culver's is now my favorite fast-food joint! Their food and service is top notch, and the restaurant is always spotless.  I don't do the drive-thru, so my review is based solely on dining there. The staff is always super friendly and some of the kids are really cool and funny. We once had a hilarious discussion about Star Trek with the girl at the counter. The staff treats you like friends! Also the General Manager is very hands-on and likes to interact with the guests and talk about the food. For instance he let us know: the burgers are always fresh, NEVER frozen. The custard is shipped 2000 miles daily. They make their own root beer. The fried chicken dinner is fresh DAILY...again, never frozen. The animals on their farms are treated humanely, and there are no antibiotics or hormones in the meat. Culver's cares! They are an environmentally friendly and sustainable company with a LEED certified building.  You can tell the ingredients and the food is a cut above other fast food places - the difference is in the fresh taste of everything; the staff there takes pride in this!   Their menu is deceptively diverse - at first glance it just seems like you can order burgers with different combinations of toppings etc. But then you'll see things like chicken, pork cutlets, melts, reubens, fish etc... While they don't get all crazy like Jack in the Box, Culver's is probably tops for menu variety.  I've gotten several burgers there, and they never disappointed. While they are not the gourmet variety like Rehab or Delux, when compared to McDonald's or Burger King...there is no comparison, Culver's is way better. One of the secrets is that they sear the meat, and the edges have a tasty crispiness to them. I am a HUGE fan of the cheese curds - always my preferred side over the crinkle cut fries. Mmmm who doesn't love a bag of fried cheese curds that you can dip in ranch? Love it. Also, their famous custard has a well-deserved reputation. It is REALLY good. We've taken it home before too, or just had one there mixed with goodies like Reese pieces. Easily one of the best fast food desserts in the industry. I also love the fact that they make their own root beer, and it's served in the soda fountain; and it's really really good!   My girlfriend is a big fan of the melt sandwiches. I have tried the fried chicken dinner, and while I have had better (grandma's), for fast food I was quite surprised at what a full-sized dinner they served. 4 GIANT pieces of chicken, with cole slaw and fries. We have also eaten the fish there, and again, we recommend it. The fish sandwich is good - its North Atlantic cod, and sometimes they have a limited-time Walleye freshwater fish dinner which will knock your socks off.   Fun and friendly service. Fresh, never frozen foods from Wisconsin. One of the better burgers you can get. Tasty cheese curds. Delicious custard for dessert. And surprisingly good meals like fish and fried chicken. And homemade root beer. yep... Culver's is easily the top 3 fast food chains on the planet right now.

We love this location because the staff is so great! Friendly and accommodating with good attitudes. Not the biggest fan of their burgers - because they are a bit too greasy for me, and almost $7 for a "big" burger is not very good value, compared to some other places. The "Six Dollar Burgers" at Carl's Jr are way more satisfying when you are hungry.  But.. the crispy chicken sandwich is TO DIE FOR.  It is one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had; i don't even mind the wheat bun, it is so good! The fries are inconsistent - sometimes crazy oily, sometimes dry. But if you fill out the survey on your receipt, you will never have to pay for fries again - each time you redeem it, you'll get another receipt with free fries on it! Not a bad way to get customers to return. and they have Smashpoints reward club, and surprisingly its not a gimmick! I have gotten two free meals so far on my points, on top of free fries with every visit. Not bad - makes up for the overpriced sandwiches.  And the shakes are pretty good too, but again, not a great a value for $5.. But still tasty.  And maybe the biggest surprise to me - how good the spinach and goat cheese salad is. I would never consider getting salads at burger places (its like buying bread from deli, or meat from a bakery), but I tried it once, and was HOOKED! pretty decent size for $6. the good: staff, chicken sandwich, spinach salad, free fries with survey, points club that works, the bad: greasy burger, sandwiches and shakes are expensive the ugly: nothing...:)  Try the crispy chicken sandwich. you will not be disappointed.

Excellent family-owned Italian bistro - they call it a trattoria, and even though they offer takeout the place is really more of a ristorante by definition.  Semantics aside, I have ordered takeout there twice and both times was 5 star satisfied. I'd consider dining there too - the place looks really nice inside with a classy/casual hybrid vibe, has a decent patio in the center of the Esplanade, and the staff seems friendly & attentive. It doesn't look like they serve "family-style" Italian meals, but the menu seems based off of family recipes and supposedly the pastas are made in-house.  To be clear, my review is based off of 2 takeout orders, both on Thursday when they offer terrific lunch specials. I had the meatball sandwich the first time, and the Coppa pizza the 2nd time. Each meal cost $7 - the value here cannot be overstated. For $7 I got a heck of a fine lunch served to me. The meatball sub was delicious - on a nice toasted bun, and the meatballs tasted moist, seasoned, and homemade. Then I tried the Coppa pizza - which had a nice light airy crust that wasn't dry or greasy, topped with coppa (the Canadian term for capocollo), tomato, mozzarella, and parmigiana. It was really good, but for $7 it can be upgraded to fantastic. Not quite Chris Bianco good, but better than most pizzerias out there.  I work in the Biltmore area, and that is easily the best lunch special around - high quality food at fast food prices! Can't beat that, especially from a nice restaurant in the Esplanade. I was pleasantly surprised at how accessible and convenient Solo is - I've had to wait longer, spend more $ and eat lesser food at the corner takeout deli next door!  I look forward to having dinner there sometime soon and am glad there is a family-owned business worth supporting.

This place is a very odd mix of biker/skater dive bar and Chinese restaurant. Kind of cool atmosphere, but also trying a little too hard to be hip and trying to be more Tempe than Scottsdale, which is a bit of a fail. Personally I can totally handle the dive bar atmosphere, but the really loud music was very annoying - in our case, it was rather awkward to sit next to a table of seniors while super vulgar rap music was playing. Kinda makes this place more geared towards people aged 50 and under, and bikers. We went on a Sunday evening around 6:30pm and the service was awful. We were seated at a dirty booth that still had fortune cookie crumbs on it and was sticky. the menus were sticky also... gross!  On top of that, we sat there for over 25 minutes before the waitress showed up to ask what we would like to drink! needless to say we were ready to order the entire dinner at that point since we waited so long. We specifically said we were starting with the family size Wonton soup, crab puffs and Char-Shu pork, and for our entrees we ordered the large Mongolian beef and the small honey crisp chicken. While it took forever to get our order taken, the food was ready in about 10 minutes, which was a bit of a surprise. But they dropped the ball again by bringing out ALL our food at once! what the heck? This was so unprofessional - by the time we finished one plate to move on to the next it was totally cold. We specifically stated what we were "starting" with, but I guess the staff there couldn't care less that there is a pretty simple protocol when serving food - appetizers first, and then entrees... not everything at once. This really put a damper on our meal as we felt rushed because we wanted everything to stay hot, which didn't happen. The "family size" soup came in one single serving bowl with 1 spoon - we flagged another waitress who confirmed that was the single small soup, not family size; we informed our waitress she brought out the wrong size but it was ok, we'll just share the small bowl, as long as she didn't charge us for the larger size. Well low and behold, when the bill came it was indeed the larger size. Normally this would just be an honest error, but after having told the waitress what happened, it seemed rather unethical of her to not bother correcting the bill. I really don't care for restaurants that don't make the effort to be accurate when it comes to charging you - shady shady shady.  Now on top of the lousy service, the food ended up being subpar. The crab puffs were nice and crispy, but they were tiny; the smallest crab puffs I have seen in a while. But that was the least of our worries. The Wonton soup was a disgusting disaster. First off, they add way too many ingredients to it...it was like a salad with all the different veggies in there. The beauty in Wonton soup is the simplicity of the broth and the dumplings, with maybe some green onions. But here it was the kitchen sink thrown in, including floating shrimp. The Wontons somehow disintegrated and the soup was just wonton particles swimming in veggies and shrimp. Easily one of the worst soups I have ever been charged $10 for.  The Char-Su pork - credit for the meat itself, it was really good. Nicely bbq'd with a sauce that wasn't overbearing. However the plate itself was another disaster. There was barely any meat on it, and once we picked it out the meat, it was all shredded cabbage in sauce, in a pretty gross hot mess. Not worth the price at all. More meat, less cabbage filler to make the plate seem larger than it is, please! And then our cold entrees - the honey chicken was basically the General's Chicken slathered in honey. Didn't even have sesame seeds for a little flavour. It was not crispy at all, and was just drenched in honey. Would never order that again, it was really disappointing. the "large" Mongolian beef was on a bigger plate, but really was the same portion as the small and I would even say that I thought it had less meat on it than the small chicken plate. So kinda a ripoff to upsize it I think. Like the pork, the Mongolian beef itself was pretty tasty. But once we picked out all the meat, which was not a lot, the plate was just a giant pile of slop - shredded cabbage and sauce. When we were ordering the waitress bragged "oh we have huge portions here!"... that is a bit of a scam because the portions seemed to be mostly shredded cabbage filler! This was pretty off-putting to say the least. So from the inattentive and lousy service, to the deceptive portions with shredded cabbage making up 60% of the plates, the cold food, the disastrous soup, the inaccurate bill... the meal was a total fail. Ultimately the dive bar atmosphere with the inappropriately vulgar music was maybe the best part of the experience, because the food and service were mediocre at best. Not worth the $60 I dropped there for 2 people, not at all.  I would recommend trying RED HOUSE on Via Linda instead -best Chinese in the valley.

Review is based on a take out boxed lunch I received - have never been to the actual location. I got the Herb Box Turkey BLT ciabatta and it was 100% awful.  The sandwich was incredibly dry and bland. The ciabatta bun fell apart after a few bites and it tasted like cardboard. One of the worst sandwich buns in recent memory. There was a few meager slices of turkey and a smattering of bacon and two slices of aging tomato. The sandwich supposedly had an aoli smear, but I could neither see it or taste it. Honestly this sandwich was so dry that I desperately searched for any condiment to make it edible -  was even ready to put ketchup on it, but alas I found none and had to work my way through the crumbles of dry cracked dusty BLT. Came with a little side of orzo salad, which was ok (About 2 forkfuls), and a bag of vegetable chips which were stale and slighty devoid of flavour. I typically don't have high expectations for a boxed lunch, but this was easily the worst I have had in a while. Nowhere even close to being worth the price that was charged, it's gas-station quality. 1 star for a terrible sandwich. This experience does not motivate me to ever visit this restaurant's locations.

I have to admit, I am a bit perplexed at the low rating I have to give the food!  Pomo seems to have a great reputation and is really hyped as tops on the pizza circuit. I consider myself quite the pizza snob, so I can't describe how excited I was to finally try Pomo in Scottsdale.  The restaurant itself is nice and has a great vibe, and our server was terrific. However, I thought the pizza was incredibly subpar. You can be certified all you want with the APN and VPN, but if you serve me a personal pizza that tastes like a piece of burnt charcoal... for $17, well you know what you can do with that certificate.  and that was it... my pizza was awful. I ordered the Diavolo, and the basil was the only ingredient that I could taste. The spicy salami, was really just mini pepperonis, and any flavor they had were totally overpowered by the most pungent basil I have ever tasted on a pizza. The ingredients and flavor profiles were completely out of balance!  And on top of that, the crust had nothing but the burnt taste of the oven. Honest, it was awful. I couldn't believe it, I so wanted to love Pomo, based on what I saw (the oven, the pizza chef) and what I read.  My two dining partners enjoyed their pizzas, but they weren't overly impressed either. So maybe just mine got overcooked and burnt.... But at that price... there isn't much incentive to come try it again.  The one good thing: the tiramisu was top notch. We all really loved it, but sadly it didn't do much to quell my pizza sadness.  If I were to rank Pomo, it falls very short of Chris Bianco's, the Parlor, Grimaldi's, and Cibo. Heck, I'd rather go to Sal's in Tempe.  If INVITED back, I would more than gladly do a redo on my pizza and update this review. But otherwise, the $70 I spent there will be a memory and warning to not always believe the hype, or hold stock in "certification".

It's hard to find good bbq in Arizona. Why? because most folks here make better bbq at home than at restaurants! That being said, I am always on the lookout for a go-to bbq place and Bootleggers so far has my attention.  Let's start with the bad: and it's really just one thing - the chairs! omg are they uncomfortable! I am talking about those yellow/orange patio chairs in the dining room! From the moment I sat down till I left, the chairs were making me hate the experience. I am not disabled or elderly, but little stocky (6'1 250lbs), and the chair was pure torture. Those that get to sit on the booth side, are ok, but I will never dine there if I have to sit in that chair again. Just saying. Now the good: everything else!  The service was good, nothing memorable. I'll chalk it up to a busy Saturday night that our waiter, when asked if I want my entree (which really was an app on the menu) to arrive before or with the other entrees, did not listen to my response! Since I was treating the Nacho Flat as my entree, I asked that it come out with everyone else's food. Nope - came out way early and I was done with my meal before anyone else at my table received theirs. The waiter did not have the situational awareness to see what a mistake he had made. I'll give the place a pass on this, just this once. I still tipped over 20%, despite the rather egregious service error. The food however, is really good. The Nacho Flat didn't feel like just a plate of nachos at a bar etc... it was a whole meal, with delicious meat and crispy chips.  But let me cut to the chase, as opposed to describing the menu items: the beef brisket and the pulled pork are fantastic!  so whatever your order, as long as it has one of those items, you are in a for a great smokey bbq tastegasm.  The sides were pretty good too - the mashed potatoes with goat cheese, and cauliflower puree had a wonderful consistency and were flavorful. But this place is really about the brisket and the pulled pork. 'Nuff said.  Being slightly pricey - in line with most Old Town Scottsdale restaurants, Bootlegger's is not a place I can go to often, but when we really need to go out for bbq, this is usually the first on our list of options.

I really want to give this place at least 4 stars - if it wasn't a "fast food" type place, I might even give it 5 stars, but that is pushing it for pizza (you gotta be like Chris Bianco to get 5 stars for a pizza).  Why would I give it a high rating? The concept is great, pretty much just like Subway, but its pizza. The value is tremendous - that is a nice meal for $8. The salads are pricey, but they are a good size and same concept as pizza - build your own. The quality is surprisingly good - I like their light crispy crust, and toppings seems better than most delivery places. If you are dining in, this location is always clean and pretty fast. Basically Fired Pie almost seems like the perfect pizza joint! so where does it go wrong? Why can I not give it a high rating? THE STAFF. It is usually kids working there, and I am not complaining about them as people, but their skills as pizza artisans. The staff is friendly, so that is not the complaint. But, they RUIN the experience. The most common deficiency I have experienced every time is that they do not listen when you are building the pizza. Quick reminder: when you offer a build your own unlimited pizza, it means just that - the customer has full control of the toppings. So when I say "lot's of mozzarella cheese please", that means they put the same amount as if I had said "only a hit of cheese please". You can order or customize all you want, but it seems as the if the staff is directed to only put the most minimal amount allowable by law. It is so irritating because you either have to get a little more aggressive, or repeat yourself (that happens, I ask for more, they put so little, I have to say "again more"... then wait and then go "again, please more". And I am describing an amount that would be average for most pizza, that's how much they try to skimp.), or you trick them, and pretend that every topping you order is the last one. To me that is a ridiculous way to order food and is just disrespectful from the company to not honor THEIR concept of how the pizza will be ordered and assembled. Getting the correct amount of toppings there is a nightmare!  And I see here, that that is the most common complaint. I realize the management has cost control, but their approach is a real turn off. Saving pennies on cheese and olives is probably not as advantageous as actually satisfying customer and having them return often.  The other complaint about the staff? Again part of the incompetence I have seen repeatedly - they do not clean the oven properly or enough. And with their concept, they move a lot of pies through that oven, so it is integral to keep it clean.  Last night was the last straw - the pizza was baked correctly, but the undercrust was layered in black greasy...coal. It was the burnt off grease and crumbs from a day's worth of pizza. I picked up my first slice and my fingers were coated in a black sludge. My gf too, she had the sludge all over her hands. As a former pizzeria manager, I know for a fact that they simply did not brush the over regularly with a scraper. It was disgusting. We had take-out, but if I had dined-in, I would have given that pizza back and told the manager that they literally served inedible food. Who would eat a pizza with a bottom covered in black sludge? How can they serve that and expect to stay in business? That happened to me once at Ray's and the manager was understandably embarrassed and rectified the situation. Here, it has happened more that once. Not acceptable.  Also, from last night, the girl who made our pizza - we looked at her with incredulity - the way she handled the food it was so obvious that she had NEVER handled food before in her life. Also as if she had never eaten or seen a pizza before - the way she distributed the tiny amount of toppings was almost comical. She put the tiniest amount of shredded cheese, right in the middle of the dough, and that was it. Like she had no concept of how this pizza was going to be sliced and eaten. It was ridiculous. pizza is not a hot dog or a hoagie - there is an certain amount of competence and artisanry required, you can't just throw it together, toss it in a filthy oven and serve it to a family. You have to know how a pizza is properly made and assemble and the staff at Fired Pie seem CLUELESS. or they just don't care.  Either way - great concept and great product. Terrible execution and awful customer service.  Gonna try Pizza Me on Hayden - exact same concept and price. Maybe their staff actually knows what they are doing and will win my business. Fired Pie drops the balls with their staff.

This place is a true gem, just like their original store! Both locations are owned and operated by brothers from Detroit (repping the Red Wings will get you bonus points at the store lol), and this place is the classic old-school neighborhood convenience store - a rarity nowadays in our corporate world. Imagine if Cheers the bar, was a convenience store; this is it. The staff know most people by name as they walk in! And don't be surprised if you find some celebrities like Shane Doan or Kurt Warner in there sometimes. Why? because of the amazing sandwiches! Sure the store has a good selection of convenience items - snacks, toiletries, newspapers, some groceries, and a large selection of wine & beer etc... things you would find at Circle K, but what sets the place apart are the sandwiches. The store has a small deli inside, and they make some of the very best subs and sandwiches in the valley! SO GOOD. They bake their own bread daily. All meats are quality. The way they assemble the sandwiches is true craftsmanship. I have eaten there countless times, and not once was disappointed with what they made me. My favorites are The Shane Doan (not on the menu, but its a glorious roast beef melt), the Beefstrami, the Caesar chicken (so refreshing!), and my girlfriend is addicted to the Double Play turkey on rye. I cannot emphasize more how tasty their sandwiches are and how welcoming the owners are! I even consider them friends now, they are that cool.  So, if you live around the 101 & Frank Lloyd Wright, near Cactus/Shea.. there is no reason to shop for conveniences at any other place! You will be hooked on their sandwiches!!!

Let me just say this: for this concept and this price - go to Fired Pie instead.   Tried Pizza Me and was thoroughly disappointed. The pizza was just not very good, plain and simple. Bland and tasteless, the crust was like cardboard. And unlike Fired Pie, you really have no control over the toppings, despite the perception that its a Subway-style build-your-own. At least at Fired Pie you can get them to add more of a specific topping you really like, here they make it as they see fit, the customization is a bit of a hoax. I've had frozen pizza from Walmart that tasted better! And the staff, typical of teens, had that could-care-less attitude. In fact, I witness one girl put the carbon copy of a receipt ON TOP of the pizza itself, touching the food. This is incredibly unsanitary, not to mention ignorant of how bad the ink on those receipts are - you aren't really supposed to touch them with your bare hands (look it up, they cause cancer), let alone let it rest on the food you are about to eat! So I kindly politely pointed that out to the girl, and she just shrugged her shoulders and did absolutely nothing. This place is a bit of a joke to be honest, the way they were so careless with the food. I have had many issues with the staff at Fired Pie also, but I will go back there and not to Pizza Me because the quality of food at Fired is vastly superior, and you get a larger pizza for the same price. Pizza Me? Pizza Nobody if you ask me....

Best Mexican fast-food in the North Scottsdale area!  The prices are fair, but you get A LOT of food. We usually have some to take home every time, sometimes even half the meal. The value you get for what you pay cannot be beat. More importantly - the food is VERY yummy. The service is also good, the girls at the counter are always very friendly and accommodating. For quick Mexican food, this place cannot be beat by Filiberto's or Habanero's. Quite possibly the perfect fast-food Mexi place. I recommend the Grande breakfast burrito (possibly the best breakfast burro we have ever had), the California, the Surf 'N Turf (its a little messy though) burro, the hard tacos, the rolled tacos, the quesadillas. Also HIGHLY recommend the flautas - you basically get a decent sized chimi for $3. Its an awesome deal. Compare this place to Habanero's - which is overpriced, serves less on each plate, and tends to overcook their meats. No comparison. I'm pretty picky about Mexican food, because it is so easily either generic or overdone - but Senor Taco finds a perfect middle balance of simple Sonoran foods that are perfectly prepared and served. This is definitely our new go-to place when we need to fill up, be quick, and not spend a lot of $.

Decent local brewery with a limited menu selection that has some very overpriced items. We've been there twice now. First the beer - since its a brewery. There is a pretty large selection of craft beers, but I must say most of them seem to be "trendy hipster" type beers. A connoisseur would probably enjoy trying all the different types; I'm more of a lager guy and I really could not find a single beer that seemed light and refreshing for the hot Scottsdale weather. The waitress could only recommend a pretty hoppy and malty pilsner. We ended up taking a gamble on a beer that had quite the poetic description of its flavor profile; it was gross and we couldn't even finish a glass. There wasn't anything wrong wit the beer, some people may absolutely love it, but it wasn't for us - it was just too pungent and overwhelming. While I can appreciate the artistry of the beers they craft, this simply isn't a brewery that caters to my tastes, it's more for trendy hipster types who like fancy & esoteric brews.   The food - some of the items were quite good, but way overpriced. If I had to recommend 1 item, it would be the Bison Burger. Really good! but, again, expensive at around $15!  My girlfriend had the veggie burger and found it "ok, nothing special". Again, not worth the high price. The biggest disappointment was the fish 'n chips entrée - the walleye. For almost $20 I got three tiny pieces of fish, about the size of a small chicken strip and mostly just oily batter, and then a ton of soggy fries. I would definitely NOT recommend this dish - you get about $4 worth of food. I totally felt ripped off.  Overall, with a decent atmosphere and locally crafted brews, the food is good but way overpriced. If I was rich, I would be a repeat customer, otherwise I can't really think of a reason to go back - unless they discounted the Bison burger! Two people can easily spend $75 there and I bet that 50/50 chance that at least one of the entrees will be disappointing. Not good value at all.

Very yummy and very expensive! Being a big fan of Delux Burger, we decided to try their sister business next door - formerly known as Revo Burro and now goes by Mexx32.  The interior is classy and elegant, making Mexx32 a rather upscale Mexican restaurant. Don't expect Filiberto's here!  First off, service was tremendous. Our waiter was very attentive and on point with recommendations and enthusiasm for our lunch. We mentioned we were in a time crunch and he made sure everything happened as fast as possible, but without feeling rushed. During our meal, the owner stopped by to chat and make sure everything was ok. Again - excellent service at Mexx32. Now the food - thankfully the quality and flavours matched the service. The complimentary chips and salsa were great as starters. We ordered the cheese crisp, which was filled with flavourful and gooey varieties of cheese. It was a little on the soggy side, as opposed to crisp, but with that much cheese it's to be expected. For $12 though, that is the most expensive cheese crisp I have ever had!  For our entree we had the smoked brisket burrito. The meat was very good - you could taste that it was smoked for a long time but it was still quite tender. Wrapped in a flour tortilla, I didn't even notice what else was in the burro because I just focused on the flavour of the meat. A good burrito made great by very tasty brisket - however for $10 it was pretty small and thus ultimately is one of the pricier burritos I have ever had. notice a trend here? everything tastes good, but is crazy expensive. Now Mexx32's secret weapon - the creamy rice. wow that was fantastic! Easily one of the tastiest sides of rice I have ever had. but guess what? crazy expensive! ok it's only 3 dollars, but it comes in literally the smallest side dish you can imagine - about 2-3 forkfuls.  I am a working class joe, so this is the type of place I can visit maybe 1-2 times a year, but I would definitely be interested in eventually trying it again and exploring more of the menu (and ordering 4 servings of that rice! lol), but $40 for 1 burrito, 1 cheese crisp, 1 side of rice and 1 soda is much too pricey for me to be a regular.  High quality food with terrific flavours, small portions, and big prices. Mexx32 is a special-occasion Mexican restaurant that will not disappoint, but not a place to frequent regularly, unless you are a Biltmore millionaire.  Could easily be a 5 star rating, but the pricing makes it 3 stars, while the food taste bumps it to 4 stars. Recommended if you can afford it - 2 person meal will average $60.

Cafe Rio is basically a clone of Chipotle. The place is clean, the service is mediocre, and the food is overpriced & bland. The best item they have is the sweet pulled pork - the chicken has zero flavor. My issues with the service were thus: we arrived over an hour before closing and I ordered the pork burrito. They was about a 1/4 of a serving of pork left in the bin, and if I hadn't been watching that is all the kid would have put in my burrito. He scraped the bin to get every last bit for me, but it was still not even half the meat they should be using, so he offered to replace the remaining meat with chicken and I unwisely agreed. He didn't drain the soggy wet chicken at all - so the result was a burrito in a tinfoil pan that was basically a soup at the bottom. Forget about actually picking up the burrito to eat with your hands like anywhere else, you had to use fork and knife, and could have switched to a spoon by the end. It was pretty disgusting - all that wet tortilla and soggy meats. On top of that, the chicken had zero flavor, not even salt seasoning taste. The pork was flavorful, but I only got the tiniest hint of it, maybe two bites. The black beans were equally bland with zero flavor and no seasoning. I didn't mind the rice however, and was glad it wasn't the typical Spanish rice with nothing but cumin seasoning. But for $9, the rice isn't going to cut it when everything else was a major disappointment. The burrito was a total fail. My girlfriend got the pork tacos and thought they were good - she obviously chose wisely, and also got all the pork and left none for me! lol But to run out of your signature meat over an hour before closing? That's just bad kitchen management. Then on top of all that, I had a real craving for chips and queso - and they were offered on the menu and I ordered them. It wasn't until we were paying that we were informed that they do not have any chips and cannot fulfill our entire order. They couldn't say that earlier? They couldn't put up a note on the wall menu - out of chips! Common courtesy to your guests before they waste time standing in line and actually place an order. I did not want to dine there if we couldn't get the chips I wanted, we would have gone elsewhere - so it was pretty unethical of them to get me to the very end before letting me know I am not getting what I wanted to pay for. That is bad customer service, especially if you are expecting a guest to return. Now I don't want to ever go back there, whereas I probably would have if they told me "no pork, no chips" and we went elsewhere and took a rain check on Cafe Rio. It's only fair, and good business practice. The other thing that really bothered me, was while our food was being prepared one of the workers, I will assume the manager because he had a really arrogant attitude, was berating a younger worker for putting too much cheese on our food! he kept telling him to place less ingredients into our meal. Excuse me, please try to be a cheap bastard while the customer is NOT right in front of you! That is incredibly unprofessional and also showed how stingy this place is going to be every time. Basically the staff itself showed me that the food there is not a good value for the price you pay.  I appreciate the concept of this place, and even making tortillas from scratch is great, but if you are going to cheat the customer out of proteins and cheese, have completely bland chicken and beans, not be able to competently put a proper burrito together, and not be honest about your menu - you aren't going to get any return business.  Taco Senor is about 3 minutes away and blows this place out of the water with their tasty food, amazing prices, and terrific service. No comparison, go to Taco Senor instead of lame Cafe Rio. This place is for unsuspecting people with no taste buds.

SUB-PAR MEDIOCRE MOVIE VIEWING EXPERIENCE DUE TO IMPROPER PROJECTION OF MOVIES. I see all the reviews complaining about the concessions, the seats, etc... I have no issues with any of that. My gripe is how the movie is presented on the screen, and at this AMC (sadly like many others) they are literally ripping the audience off by presenting the darkest version of the movie possible - 50% less light than what it should be! I would say the projectionist is incompetent, but I know the reason is because the theater insists on showing 2D movies through the 3D dual lens projectors, which for 3D have to reduce the light by 50%. Well when you do that for a 2D movie, what you get is a REALLY SHITTY PICTURE QUALITY. Movies are filmed to have vibrant bright colours that bring the picture to life. Most good HD TV's can replicate that at home, given the proper settings. But when you go out to a movie and spend $20 for a professional presentation, it is totally unacceptable that they exhibit the movie improperly, thus selling you a really poor version of the movie you paid to see. I find this to be rather despicable way to exploit the consumers, because they are too cheap (or lazy?) to be equipped with the PROPER projectors for the proper movie format. 2D movies are not to be shown through 3D projectors! Its that simple, but we are still getting ripped off constantly by AMC. I recently saw Eye in the Sky at the Desert Ridge AMC and as soon as the trailers began I notice something was egregiously wrong with the projection quality. The trailer for Suicide Squad was so dark we literally saw nothing of the action  - it made the movie look like a muddled mess with no light or colour, which I know it is not. This was faulty projection. And when the movie started... same thing, it was so dark with all the colours muted. That is NOT how the director, producers, studio intended this film to be viewed, but AMC doesn't care and gives you a half-assed presentation that looks like total garbage. I stood up, looked back, and confirmed it - I could see through the projection window that this movie, which is standard 2D, was being shown through TWO 3D lenses, thus cutting the lighting down by 50%. UNACCEPTABLE.  I see at least 3-5 movies a month at the theater, and frankly I am getting sick and tired of these multiplexes improperly projecting the movies and thus giving you a viewing experience that is now actually lower quality that what you can get at home on a Blu-Ray player and 1080p HD TV with the proper setting.  What are the typical complaints to theater management? noise, rude people, shitty concessions? well its time that we started calling them out for their POOR PROJECTION! Notice your movie is way too dark? Well go get a manager and complain and demand a refund that you are legally entitled to (for pre-paid services not rendered). If enough people can do this, they might realize that picture quality is indeed a priority for their business to remain viable.
