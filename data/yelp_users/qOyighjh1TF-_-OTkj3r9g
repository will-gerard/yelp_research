This place is pretty great. The gyros are good (though I feel like an ass every time I say JaiRo and they say it back as GearO), the salad is good, greek fries are awesome (just tons of Feta melted on top), and baklavaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....  Plus, it's usually only about a ten-minute wait for pick-up and the owners are pretty friendly.  Not open on Sunday, which kinda sucks.

In another city, this would be a 3 star bar, in Mesa - it gets the boring-as-hell-city one-star bump. Definitely not the best sports bar, but there is enough going for it that it's definitely worth checking out....  Pros: Decent specials during the week Awesome, awesome, awesome wings! Cute waitresses (especially Ashley, who I might dare call hot) Clint, the usual night manager, is the man Pretty good food (especially the mac and cheese and aforementioned wings) Tons of TVs Nice outdoor patio Monday Night Football Bingo Free Poker Thursday  Cons: Bad weekend music (and in general the weekends are lame, but that's East Mesa for you) Octogenassholes during the specials No sun-blocking screen for some of the outdoor TVs No wing special for football and no pitchers Annoying and terrible trivia and trivia host   Like I said, not perfect, but if you want a nice place to watch a game or grab some after-work drinks, Sunday Funday, etc, it's about as good as East Mesa has....   (Oh, and in the purpose of full-disclosure, Ashley is my girlfriend....so yeah maybe I'm a little biased, even though she'd probably yell at me if she saw the cons in my review)  Update 8/24: She did yell at me

And now I get to write my very first negative review. Much like with my first review, I thought for a bit about who I'd rant about first, and it had to be El Hefe.....so where to begin?  When you're inside the atmosphere and ambience is about as welcoming as I'd imagine the inside of one of the breast implants of their servers would be (you know, large, inflated, empty, and possibly a little gooey). The one time I went I believe we waited about an hour from asking for our check, waiting for our waitress to figure out how to split it up as we asked, and then royally effing it up in the end anyway (yeah, I know that can be annoying, but if arithmetic isn't your strong suit, just tell us - it's not your fault that the blood isn't flowing to your brain at the correct speed because it was thwarted at the Hoover-like circulation dam that are your boobs....well actually that is your fault, but still we won't hold it against you). The tacos aren't good, the drinks are over-priced, it's full of your typical Scottsdale douchebags, whose unfortunate existence ensure that the type of waitresses that populate these types of bars continue to get hired, and its in the middle of a bunch of better options.  Also, they should really spell Jefe right.

Got a message from the owner. I appreciate that at least - though it doesn't really change my view on my experience and my review still holds. To soften it though, I'll just say this place definitely isn't for me.

Good new Thai place in Mesa. Compared to Thai Patio, the portions are huge and just as good, and they usually get the spicy level just right for both me (3.5 on a 1-5 scale) and my girlfriend (2) on the curry. They have a fried shrimp appetizer that's also pretty good - definitely my favorite Thai in the area.
