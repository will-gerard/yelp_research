Very good noodle shop.  I got referred here on my second day in town by the folks at Fujiya.  They were right.  I went for lunch and I almost could have missed it, tucked away in a little corner in a shopping plaza.  But the outside appearance belied the cute interior.   I am waiting for it to get cold out (or even mildly less than scorching) so I can go in for some Ramen!!  Real Ramen - nothing like it.  This trip I had Tempura and some cold noodles. - Good stuff.

I absolutely could not say it better than Alicia B.  "I'm only concerned with the fish."  Check out her review for the most succinct bottom line on Ra.  I can't say it as well or in so few words - so I will just tell you what happened to me.  Seriously - I went there for the sushi and trust me, I was alone in that endeavor.  Everyone else was there for the scene.  What has been said here is true.  It is loud music, loud people, over the top decor.  We sat at the sushi counter, not because they were busy, but mostly because we couldn't get the host's attention.  The "chef" (and I use that term generously here) who was in front of us had completely no idea what he was doing.  Granted he said he was new there, but he took our order sheet and handed it off to the next guy because he said he couldn't handle it.  I can understand "I'm still learning the ropes." so I cut him some slack and tried to make conversation.  "So, do you like to make sushi at home."  "No, I've never made sushi before, but I like to eat it."  You do not get to stand in front of customers, profess you know nothing, and cut cream cheese for a 1/2 hour.  Yuck!  We ordered: toro sashimi, hamachi sashimi, saba oshi sushi, uni sashimi, some crispy-spicy tuna thing, and some veggie tempura.    The saba oshi sushi completely threw them.  Why even have a special order line if you can only make the 7 or 8 standard items you have on the menu?  So the "experienced chef" to whom the menu was handed said, "you want saba sushi"?  I wanted to be clear so I said, "Mackerel OSHI sushi, you know, box pressed Mackerel."  I got the "Oh, ok" but I was skeptical.  Then he kept asking me crazy questions, "You want that with rice? Are you sure you just want Mackerel? No other fish with that?"  I offered to just let him give us Saba Nigiri, much simpler.  If you don't have the box or you can't do oshi sushi, no problem - I gave him every out.  We basically ended up with Saba Don - nothing like what I ordered and no willingness to admit none of them had any idea what they were doing.  And it was way sub par saba at that.  So, they were out of the toro.  No apologies, just "We don't have that." We tried to order the scallop dish as a substitute, but that never came.  In the end, all the better I figure.  The crispy-spicy tuna thing was almost ok.  Except the spicy was mostly jalapeno and just totally wrong for the dish and the crispy stuck to my teeth.  The tempura was the only thing that was close to good.  It was too thickly battered though and didn't come close to tempura at its finest.  The uni was gross.  I took one bite and left it there.  It was slimy and not fresh at all.  I didn't realize when I walked in, but I really shouldn't have ordered it.  This is not the place anyone who cares about fresh fish really eats.  The uni was never going to be a big seller or any good at a place like this.  This is where people go to drink silly fru fru drinks, eat exorbitant rolls that don't even resemble sushi, and to have their conversation drown out by loud music so they don't even have to think.  OK on top of it being a horrible experience, the fish just sucked.  Really, terrible quality, terrible selection.    I came here on a recommendation, but can not believe I didn't check Yelp first.  Shame on me.  I will not be fooled again.

Small, but well stocked.  All of the Japanese basics are here.  It's nice to have a local Japanese grocer and not have to resort to an Asian-Mega-Mart.  There's not a lot of fresh produce, but great frozen and dry goods options.  I'll have to try the prepared food sometime.  They were sold out for the day by the time I went in the afternoon.

This was pretty good fare.  I had a stewed lamb dish.  Unlike any Mexican I have ever had.  Come to think of it, I've never had lamb at a Mexican restaurant, or in Mexico.  Everyone I was with enjoyed what they got.  Most had Mole, one had a steak.  The tappas we had at first were a good sampling, even if they were foisted upon us.  I went with a big group.  The waitress was pushy, that was the only negative.  She basically told us this is what we were getting for appetizers, a sample tray, and we were getting 3 for the table.  We really had no input.  They did not have a liquor license, but I can't dock any stars for that if they let you BYOB and no one advertised it for its drinks.  Although I must tell you that bar tender looked pretty lonely at his empty bar polishing his glasses all night.  I was told the liquor license thing is an on again off again thing for them.  They insisted on pouring the wine we brought in, even though no one there could tell a Chardonnay from a Pinot Noir.

I have been twice for breakfast and the meals for both my friends and I were great!  The service was very prompt and friendly.  I have also gotten caramel iced coffee and the little box of treats to go, also very good.  It is great to have a local little place that outshines the Starbucks across the parking lot.

This place rocks!  I just moved here and was nervous about finding a new stylist.  I had been going to the same guy for the last 8 years.  Fear no more - Way Cool/Hair Pollution took care of me.  The good vibes flowed from the first phone call I made.  They were smart and professional over the phone.  Although they were efficient and didn't waste my time, they also took time to ask me the right questions about what I needed in a cut and stylist.  They asked good questions and were smart about who they paired me up with.  I also got an appointment within two days - no long wait.  I got hooked up with Darci.  She listened to what I loved about my previous style and also tuned in to what I didn't love.  She restated what I said I wanted just to make sure she got it all.  I basically wanted my regular haircut but a little more sassy.  (My old stylist used to play it safe.)  She gave me the edgy, piecey cut I was looking for.  I think it is remarkable that she gave me the haircut I was looking for and could do that cut really well.  But I think the best part is the way she listened and tried to make it exactly what I wanted.  That makes me think she could do the same for anyone and any cut.  I left there feeling great about my new look.  I waited a few days to write the review because I wanted to be sure that I could still feel like a rock star when I styled it myself.  I have to say - wow!  I have worn it curly, wavy, straight, blown out, flat ironed and air dried  I even took this cut to humid frizzville Atlanta and it stood up to the test.  And price to value, there's no beating it.  I was used to paying double for my cut in Miami.  As Amanda B. said, there was even a $10 discount for the first cut.  30 bucks for a cut I am this happy with, I can hardly believe it.  I have to thank the previous reviewers because you guys convinced me I would like it here.  I am disappointed that they don't offer any other salon services, not even simple waxing.  But I couldn't even knock them a star for that.  They don't purport to be a full service salon - it would just be nice.

Stacy is a really cool cat.  Even if he "don't know nuthin' about no internet".  He asked me how I found out about the place, since he has only been there for 6 months.  Stacy tells me he has no computer and absolutely can NOT believe there are people out there yelping about him.  I told him about reviews I had read and he kept saying "people write that shit about me?"  I told him about someone being told they could bring in beer and about some cool customer service that was laid on some others.  Stacy was cooking up some etouffee - not on the menu - but he brought some over for us to taste.  It was out of this world...shrimp, crawdads, yum.  He said he was making it up for a catered event he was doing.  He used to make it at the soul food restaurant he ran, and it was a special request.  Then he brought us a fried catfish sample, then fried pickles (not a fan).  Between the ribs and pulled pork we got - and the love & samples that kept pouring from the kitchen - we had more than enough food and ended up taking a lot of it home.  Lisa took care of us and she was great.  She spent the time humorously trying to explain the Stacy about the computer, yelp and his reviews.  It created a great family atmosphere.  It's not a fancy place by any means, we're talking rib shack, and it was a bit hot.  Bottom line - it's not the best bbq I've ever had...but this is not exactly a city people think of when they think bbq.  And for the prices, hospitality, and genuine wit...it can't be beat.  I'll be back and bring friends - it's just downright fun there!
