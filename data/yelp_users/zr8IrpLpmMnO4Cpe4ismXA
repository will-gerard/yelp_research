Ok, so I tried the one in Gilbert and gave it a terrible review because of the waitress and price of food. So a friend said to try the one in Scottsdale because the food is really good and there is a younger waitress that is spot on with the service. This place is down right scummy! Don't eat here is you value your life. The wiatress no longer works there and good for her. She was smart enough to get out of this dump. This owner Chad is a jerk. So arrogant and sits around on his stupid phone while others are working. I really don't blame the wait staff. The apple bakes are suppose to be the best around. Sure if you like your food to put you in a diabetic coma. There was so much sugar, I am surprise it didn't give be diabetes right then. I had to ask for an egg over easy just to try to eat something good. After waiting for 30 minutes for one egg, wow. $2.25 for 1 egg. It's an egg with nothing in it or on it. My first review of this place was correct. NOOOOOOO Way, Never again!!!!!

This place is a sty. We heard about the reclining seats and were excited but they were not comfortable at all. This theater was disgustingly dirty. We made the mistake of not having something to eat before so we had their hot dogs. They were stale and gross, one bite and trashed it. Popcorn doesn't come buttered, you have to do it yourself. It's very difficult with a tub. The staff was very nice. That was the only nice part. Never again!

The best steakhouse ever! I have been to several chef restaurants in Vegas but this one by far beats them all! The steaks of course are incredible but the sides make the meal. We had the mushroom assortment and the risotto. Tge best risotto! Thanks Dan for making it fun too. You're a great manager! Thanks for the tip too, wink wink! We'll definitely be back again next trip as this is our favorite place to dine.

Wish I could give ZERO stars. This is the worst magic/illusionist show I have ever seen.  Tired old sets. Planted audience for stupid acts. The icing was the ET Phone home bit with the little alien.  What are we, 5 years old? Not that I believed for a second it was real but you could actually here the motor mechanism going when David hugged it. Wow David,  did we not get to play with dolls as a child? Lame is an understatement. Every act you could guess what was going to happen. At one point he asked if we wanted to see more and I said No! I was so ready to go!

Delicious made from scratch. I've been coming here for awhile now and I'm never disappointed. Corned beef hash is from scratch not that canned stuff. Chunks of corned beef. Yummy! Pancake with bacon cooked in the batter. Heaven! They even bake their own cinnamon rolls, caramel rolls & muffins.

Honest, dependable & great customer service!  I called when another company stood me up and Dave rushed right over.  After I explained I'd had a leak (4 letter word) under my sink for over a week,  he took the time to thoroughly inspect the cause.  I had already purchased a new faucet,  just in case, which Dave was happy to put in for me.  He didn't just stop there and call it a day.  He checked,  checked & rechecked to make sure everything was working properly.  He even showed me other issues but didn't give me that high pressured sales pitch like most would do. He just explained everything and let me know what to look out for in the future.  He even called a week later, just to make sure everything was ok. Wow,  talk about follow up!

I'm a regular at this hot spot in Gilbert, AZ. The farm fresh ingredients make everything on the menu delicious. The Ahi Tuna sandwich is my go to almost every time. My husband loves all the burgers and hot dogs. Don't miss out on the best onion rings your ever going to have. The salads are delicious, especially with their green goddess dressing. I haven't tried their pizzas yet but they are definitely on my to do list. Their breakfasts are great too. Fresh fruit on the waffles and pancakes! Relax under the trees with the rest of the patrons. It's great to share your table and meet new people. Kids just love it there too. Real chicken breast used for the chicken tenders! It gets busy but don't let the lines out the door fool you, they are fast and if there is a little wait, it's definitely worth it. The staff are the happiest and friendliest for a group who don't get tips, although they do deserve it.

I can't understand why anyone likes this place when there are so many better choices around town. I've tried twice always to be disappointed.  The sandwiches are drenched in oil. The desserts are discusting. They are dry and have no flavor. They're not even sweet. Their coffee just plain sucks. The market is pretty good and I love the different spreads but that's their only redeeming quality. Thanks for replying to my review,  however,  I did bring it to the attention of the staff who not only wouldn't make it better, refused a refund. Maybe you should talk to them about their policies on customer service.

Zero stars to go along with the 0 tip that I gave to our waitress Megan for ruining my birthday dinner. She basically told us when she started to serve us, that she was really tired because she had been there all day long, like I care that she is tired so basically you're telling me ahead of time that she can provide awful service because she's tired and has been there all day long thanks a lot. So I guess you know that the service was all downhill from there. As I can see that she gave excellent service to the table that was next to us, because she waited on them hand and foot but forgot about us and we had to ask for refills on everything remind her of food that she needed to bring out along with we didn't even get a free birthday dessert. She charged us for the birthday dessert, she didn't even have the nerve to go and ask the manager so he could comp it for us. I didn't need her to comp it but she could have done it as a courtesy. Horrible! Besides telling us she needed help singing the Happy Birthday song because she's a horrible singer I guess that goes along with her horrible service

So after I received a call from the manager apologizing for the horrible service, he stated he was sending a gift card to have my family back for a meal on the house plus a complimentary dessert.  He sent $30. What??? My bill was $90. How is a family of four supposed to have a meal for $30? Shame on you for wasting my time.  I'd rather go to the Chandler location.

That's it. This place is a complete downer.  They no longer have a wait staff which based on my previous reviews could've been a plus but no. If your not going to serve people then your food better be awesome and above all else,  you have to be extra nice.  Nicole needs to find a different job. Between here and The Bistro,  she is the main complaint from everyone on both yelp sites. Blake, who is the owner and chef, is the sweetest nicest guy ever.  Sorry but your wife needs to go.

Discusting.  Hard tamales covered in a gross green sauce which made the outside gummy.  Rice was horrible.

I love sushi! This place is at the bottom of places I would go to have sushi. The fish didn't taste fresh. I know in Arizona it can be hard to get fresh fish but since I've been to at least 20 other places in Arizona for sushi, I have to say this is the worst.  They obviously have their regular clients that they cater to, but I felt invisible.  Or maybe is was because no one in my party drank alcohol. But there are much better sushi places even though they're about 40 minutes away then waste my money here.

This guy is horrible!  I've been waiting a week for him to come to take care of the leak underneath my sink. He calls me the day of the appointment at an hour before he supposed to show up that suddenly he can't come because he's got other customers with emergencies because my leak isn't an emergency to him and then he's going to be out of town and he can't come for another week.  Horrible customer service.  Never! !!!  So he called back immediately to apologize.  He said he would do anything to make it up to me.  I decided to give him another chance.  My daughter had a clogged toilet.  I asked him to come and do it for free, thinking, no way he would.  He agreed.  Wow, what a turn around.  He apologized about 10 more times.  So we scheduled an appointment for the following week and he was good on his word. Completed in a hour and no charge.  Thanks Scott!  That's an apology!

Disgusting!  For all of you that gave this place rave reviews,  you obviously have no idea this place doesn't clean their cooking area. The waffle maker and pans are not cleaned daily.  This place needs a visit from the health department.  Gross!

This place is disgusting.  The pizza was cold in spots and in no way fresh. We ordered ravioli which the waitress said the plate was really hot and to be careful.  She even carried it with a towel.  Too bad she didn't really check. The ravioli were cold and the sauce was barely warm. They weren't even busy as we were the only customers on a week night. Should've known since it was empty. Never again.

Finally, great mexican food in Queen Creek. Small lil place that if you blink you could miss it, but I'm sure glad we didn't. I've only been there once but my daughter has twice and she loved it too. We even saw owners from another restaurant eating there on their day off, and their restaurant's food in awesome. Says alot when a chef from another restaurants eats at your place.

Well, this place has had plenty of time to get they're act together.  The service is horrible!  Food is just ok, which is sad because when they opened they got 4 stars from me.  I'm surprised that they're still in business but there isn't a whole lot of options here. The chips n Salsa/Bean Dip is yummy but that's it. Keep searching!

So I wanted pizza one day but the local places just don't measure up. I remembered driving down San Tan Blvd in Queen Creek and J J's. The first time had a chicken pita, it was delicious! Husband & wife owned & run. Greek food yes, but I thought, pizza? Well let me tell you, this Italian girl can't be fooled. The pizza was awesome. Perfect crust, not thick not thin, just right. The sauce was tasted like my grandma made it. Cheese was not lacking. Looking forward to trying some of their specialty pizzas. The best pizza in town.

Food has always been really good & the service really pleasant!  Now that they have more on the menu,  it's my new favorite spot. Eating on the terrace (no pun) is awesome on a nice day too. I had the Corona cod sandwich & my hubby had the Philly.  The portions were the perfect size.  You have your choice of side, onion rings are delicious as well as the fries with garlic parmigiano.

Worst Denny's ever. The first time which should have been my last, there were tomato seeds on my French toast. I have no idea how that could happen but ok. I tell the waiter and he looks at me all puzzled. He had no idea what he should do. Finally I suggested a new batch. He actually said he had to ask his manager first. Really? Ok maybe he's never been a waiter before. So they make a new batch, it wasn't cooked through. The bread was mushy and cold. So I got up to speak to the manager and he comped my meal. We'll, gee, thanks, since I didn't eat anything, ya I would think so. He explained they just opened and still working out the kinks. So after about a month, I went back. I again was served cold food after waiting 30 min. to get the order. So the idea of waiting longer for a new order was that appealing. The same manager came over asked us to stay and the whole meal would be comped, so after another 30min of waiting, finally food came out. Warm, not hot but ok. The third time was the charm. The waiter insisted he could remember everything without writing it down, ok. He couldn't even get our drink order right. Of course our order was completely wrong and I requested the manager right away. He remembered me from our previous time and took our order himself, writing everything down, said the meal was comped. So I figured, ok since the manager himself was taking the order and was going to go in the kitchen himself to make sure it was right there should be no problem. Boy was I wrong. Cold food and my kids order was wrong. We all got up and walked out without saying a word to them. If the manager can't get it right, how are the servers ever going to?

This bakery brought me back to my childhood with one wiff of their delicious pastries and cookies. The fresh cannoli was creamy and the shell melted in my mouth. There were so many delicious choices, but had an old favorite, sfogiatelle. My husband had the chai tea cupcake with lavender frosting. He said the flavors were amazing, one of the best cupcakes he's ever had! We've tried cupcakes from Whole Foods, but why pay $5 for a cupcake when you can get one that's even better for $2.50. They have fresh baked rolls and bread on the weekend. Can't wait for the holidays to try all my holiday favorites. The owner is generous and a sweet lady. Her love and passion shines through her offerings. Her smile could light a city block. Don't miss out on this gem. True Italian bakery, yum!

I called this place when they first opened and was told they had Boar's Head cold cuts. So I stopped by with my husband for lunch. What a disappointment! I could have made a better sandwich at home. Hardly any meat, no condiments between two slices of white bread. They are overpriced. No sides come with your sandwich, so be prepared. I don't even know if they have sides. The staff didn't seems to know what they were doing.

If I can give 0 stars I would. This is got to be by far the worst IHOP restaurant in the history of all IHOP restaurants. Not only is the food bad and you think they could do breakfast correctly, yuk! And the service by the worst inexperienced staff ever!

Yes! Finally found a great place for breakfast. I asked the waiter what was good and he made some suggestions based on what he liked. Eggs with their chili verde sauce,  so delicious.  I'm not a fan of "country potatoes", rather have hash browns but it's not offered.  My reply, who cares,  the potatoes were perfect. Next visit,  my husband and I both had the Texas skillet,  it was beyond good. Bold flavors,  cooked perfect!  You have a winner!

Pretty excellent! The butter crust is my favorite.  You could put any topping and the pizza would be perfect every time.  I always phone order instead of eating in only because the place is packed all the time. Staff is super friendly and always make sure your order is correct.  The only drawback,  the hours of operation.  I wish they were open for lunch.

The food here is disgusting. We tried to order food from the menu only to be told that they no longer had any. They were in the midst of changing their menu. Then provide a correct menu. We finally settled for the French dip sandwich.  The meat was old and rubbery.  The cheese was one slice of cheese. The bread was gummy from the meat juices.  The waitress decided to forget us after that. She hung out near the bar the rest of the time. We had to wave her over just to get our check.

Fantastic!  Breakfast burritos are huge and tasty.  The sandwiches are huge too.  Had a lox board and it was delicious,  brought back some good memories.  Fresh ingredients too.  The staff is very friendly and eager to please.  Open daily which is a huge plus on my book! Had the quiche couple weeks ago.  Yummy,  with a side salad made it the perfect lunch. Delicious! Bold coffee is really good!

Hubby had the meat board,  I had the vegetable board,  both where huge and delicious! The fig jam is so good. Owners are the nicest couple.  Very friendly.  I love sitting on the couch in the back and relaxing with a bold cup of coffee that tastes perfect every time. The prices are just right for the area, especially since they use fresh and local ingredients.  If you're looking for a cheap lunch,  go to a fast food place and leave this gem for those who appreciate good food!

Yummy,  does not fully describe the food here. The chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Collard greens with smoked turkey was delicious.  They even gave me some fries to try on the house!  Now I know why, they're delicious and another reason to come back if only to eat the fries. The smell of BBQ hits you from the parking lot and your mouth is watering before you walk in. The red velvet waffle is incredible.  It's like having dessert with your fried chicken.  Definitely going back to try everything else on the menu.  The staff is very friendly and Ron made us feel right at home.

Good little sushi place.  The owner is very sweet.  The atmosphere is just ok. I don't like sitting at the tables because I like to watch the sushi chef prepare the sushi. True artists!  The waite staff seem to try to please but a little chaotic.  While several servers seem to check on us, one didn't seem to know what the others were doing.  They should each be assigned to a section and leave it at that, while the owner overseas everything.  Considering it was a little busy but not packed,  I would be less likely to go on a Friday or Saturday night.  The meal itself was awesome.  Each dish/roll were presented beautifully and delicious.  Perfect portion size for each roll.  However,  edamame should always be given as part of the meal.  I shouldn't have to ask and it shouldn't be an extra charge.  If they adjusted the price of what it costs them, into the other prices,  it would make the customers feel like they're getting a freebie.  Overall,  a nice place!

Hate being seated at a high top without being asked first. Especially when there were open tables. Server was super nice and attentive. 5 stars for her. The rest of the servers look like zombies, no smiles. The food was bland and boring. I ordered the Cubano. Tasted like they got meat at a deli. The bread was bland and not grilled as stated on the menu. This is a place for drinks, not food.
