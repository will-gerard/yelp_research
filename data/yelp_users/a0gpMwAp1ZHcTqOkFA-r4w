I Just just went in and I show them exactly what haircut I wanted  with one of my recent pictures. Barber told me he could do it.  20 minutes later my hair was cut entirely too short and it looked nothing like the picture.  If you're used to going to salons and having professional cuts, avoid Vs barber shops at all cost.

Worst experience ever. Came to counter and gave my prescription to the lady at counter. Was only one in line and she estimated that the order would be ready in 40min. The order was for simply Tylenol. Then, 1hr later I came back via drive through and the order was still not filled. She told me it would be another 20 minutes. I came back 30min later -again, giving them additional time- and was told that they need another 20min.  This was absolutely ridiculous. This Walgreens can not fill a simple Tylenol prescription in over 2hrs on a Monday afternoon with no one in line.

Simply delicious.   Simple, elegant, delicious dishes & baked goods. Coffee is great, portions are medium to small. Ambience inside the bakery is good, outside there is something left to be desired.   Baked Goods = A Coffee = A Ambience = B Pricing = B
