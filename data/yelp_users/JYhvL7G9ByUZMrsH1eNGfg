Adam took me to "a different point of view" to celebrate my birthday. Super nice. Beautiful view.   We get there and there are about 3 weddings going on. Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. "Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby " That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but  then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored.   We were lead to our table (which was not a window view as Adam requested). We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit.   After a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom.   We were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good.   After dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied "we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. ".   They knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten.   Took 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check.   Horrible experience for such a special occasion.

White Chocolate is one of my favorite restaurants in town (and also one of the coolest nicknames for a basketball player,  but I digress).  Everything on the menu is delicious, the drinks are fantastic (they have a really extensive bourbon list) and the desserts are fantastic.  The ribs and rotisserie chicken is probably my favorite dish, but I've never had a bad meal here.  Highly recommended.

Excellent neighborhood Italian place.  The chopped salad is one of my favorite salads - it's the same one featured at Cowboy Ciao.  I'm a sucker for chicken parm and it was awesome.  Pizzas are great too.

Fantastic restaurant.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I loved the ribs and the brisket, and the cheddar grits (duh).  Definitely adding this to the rotation.

One of my favorite burger restaurants in town.  The sweet and spicy burger is awesome.  Cool outdoor patio seating.  Took a large group of friends here for lunch when they were in town visiting and everyone really enjoyed it.  In response to some of the negative reviews, I've always had pretty good service.  I think the prices are in line with DeLuxe and other gourmet burger/sandwich places in town.

We stopped into this place for dinner tonight and were super impressed! Everything is made from scratch, fresh and delicious!  I ordered the smoked brisket and hubby ordered the pull pork. Both were delicious! I was especially impressed with their cole slaw as it was not your typical mayo based, bad for you disaster. Actually tasted very healthy!  We sat on the patio with our puppy and the owner gave her a smoked shoulder to chew. She devoured it! Wen we were leaving he brought her a big of frozen bones to take home! How nice!  We will be back! Had a yummy meal!

We stopped by for lunch today and had a great lunch! We both got the bowl with various combinations and really enjoyed the fresh ingredients and being able to mix and match the sauces!  It was nice to find a place with healthy options that didn't taste like something that everyone else has.   The patio was nice and they accommodated our puppy!   We can't wait to stop back by!
