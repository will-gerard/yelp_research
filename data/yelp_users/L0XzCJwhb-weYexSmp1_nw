This is one of the better Chinese-American restaurants at its price range in the Scottsdale area.   Pros: most dishes have good flavor and come with large servings. The restaurant uses a lighter sauce than what you will get at Pei Wei or Panda Express so you don't feel bloated after a full meal.   Cons: some dishes lack a distinct flavor so you leave  feeling underwhelmed. Stick to the main entrees and you will be fine.

The recent corporate buyout was ultimately a negative for this once-great Scottsdale breakfast spot.  My fiancee and I began frequenting this location after moving back to Scottsdale in 2012. The restaurant had great charm with its themed decorations (the egg paintings were a hit!), family-friendly service, and a fun menu. I found that I was able to enjoy every visit no matter what I decided to order. We even found ourselves ordering takeout a few times.  During a recent trip back, we noticed that the restaurant had been sold to another restaurant group which made several changes. First, they gutted the menu and installed their own "fit" options. We later noticed that this also left out the calorie count for each item which was included in the original Good Egg menu. This new menu got rid of all of my favorite menu items. I have also noticed a change in the way they make their omelettes and other egg dishes. The flavor isn't quite there like it used to be.  Some of the other reviewers have also noticed the drop-off in service quality which used to be a hallmark. I do not know if the old servers left or just became jaded. What ever happened, getting a friendly server who wants to do well is hit-or-miss nowadays.   Finally, the decor. Why did they remove the egg paintings!? Now, this place is just another generic urban breakfast spot with nothing memorable about it. This may be the most disappointing portion of the changes.   R.I.P. old Good Egg. We will miss you.

It's hard to find good food at a decent price in this part of town, but Lunch Bag pulls it off. The food is fresh, delicious, and well portioned. My only complaint is the small indoor seating area which measures about 8 x 12.

Carlsbad Tavern has been a favorite for many years but this was my first trip in a while. The Osso Bucco continues to be a special dish and the veggie enchiladas had good flavor. Drinks from the bar were well made. The bartender was friendly and chatted us up while we waited to be seated. We ate on the deck just outside the bar which offered a good view of what turned out to be a spectacular sunset. I definitely feel like I got a good value and so will continue to come back. I only award five stars to truly one-of-a-kind restaurants. This falls just short of that but certainly does not disappoint.

One of the better pizza places in tempe. Would be a 3 star but gets the higher grade for its free delivery service.

You gotta love Green's take on vegetarian cuisine.   I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan or anything else but I do love good clean food. Green serves up delicious meals that make you forget this is not a traditional restaurant. The decor and staff also add to the experience. This spot is on my rotation for easy dinner options in south Scottsdale.   Tip: try the Big Wac or one of the rice bowls on your first trip.

You get a lot of food for the price but the restaurant is dirty and they charge you 50 cents for each to-go box.

This place is absolutely wonderful. Both locations feature good service and fast, clean food. I recommend the Breakfast Buzz, Cali Club, and Traditional Burrito for first-timers. They will also take one-off requests such as for a BLT or something along those lines. Again, very friendly people that really take care of you.

I don't say this often, but WOW. This place takes the cake for best sandwich shop in Scottsdale, maybe even in the Phoenix metro area.  I had lunch here and ordered the Ruben (not to be confused with Reuben). The cole slaw on the sandwich was perfect and the homemade condiments made the sandwich a truly exquisite experience. The potato salad side dish was much lighter in taste and fresher than any I have had for some time, although the portion was bit smaller than what I was hoping for.  At under $10 for a meal, this shop had made its way on my list of regular lunch destinations.

This is a great new business model for chiropractic care. With no appointments, affordable pricing, and fast service (usually less than ten minutes), The Joint is a highly rewarding experience. At this franchise, Dr. Judge does a great job of treating specific ailments such as jaw or lower back pain. The reception area is modern and has a relaxing vibe to it. Service from the reception desk is always great as well.

Absolutely my new favorite breakfast spot. I visit at least once a week. The breakfast buzz is phenomenal and their breakfast sandwiches are all filling and non-greasy so you never feel less than awesome after eating one.

Good food, great atmosphere, bad bad service. I was here for a college football game and had a bartender swear at me under his breath for sitting at the bar too long. It's a football game! He also gave me attitude when he messed up my check. I might go back but if this guy is there again I'll turn around and walk out.

I ordered several tapas and they were all great. The hummus nachos were the best. For drinks I had a Cucumber Mule and the Lavender. Both were fresh and well balanced. This is a great restaurant overall although the price remains a little high for the location. Almost a 5 star.

I would not come back to this location. I came in on a Sunday morning and it was immediately apparent they were understaffed. The cashier had no idea how to ring up the 15% checkin discount so we missed out on that completely. She also didn't seem interested in offering any kind of coupon. You could tell she was too frazzled to care.   It took them 45 minutes to make a latte. We were already done with our meal and then had to wait an extra ten minutes for our drinks.   The food was just ok. I had a balanced bowl with potato hash. The dish was so dry it was hard to chew. Nothing memorable here.

My overall experience here was not good.  I came for the first time a couple of weeks ago with a group of 8 on a Friday night. Service was bad. We ordered items that never came, received food we never ordered (and still had to pay for it), and were out of water more often than not. When we complained, the server blamed the setup of the restaurant as being "too confusing". We asked to speak to a manager but that didn't come either.  The food was average. It reminded me of something you get in an airport (think fast and cheap). We ordered several plates of the barrel top pizzas which lacked flavor. I had a sandwich but I couldn't tell you which one because the server brought me the wrong item and then wasn't able to identify it after. She actually said to me, "whatever it is, I hope you enjoy it!" That was a first. The sandwich itself again lacked flavor. Some of my friends got wings. They all pretty much agreed that they would not order them again.  The noise was awful. I could barely hear the person next to me. This really ruined the experience for me if the service wasn't enough.  The only reason this places gets a second star is because of the decor and location which are both great. I think this place will fail unless it can correct the issues with the service staff and improve their menu items.
