So as you can tell from all the other reviews, this sonic is utterly terrible! They are the worst fast food customer service in town.  Tonight we waited almost 20minutes for 2 small blasts and 1 small burger.  First, the drive-thru was empty when we parked. by the time our order finally was brought up to our car, several cars had come and gone through.   Since they took forever with no reason, My girlfriend and I asked to talk to the manager, and after waiting a few more minutes he just gave us an excuse that they were training 6 new people.....on a Saturday night????  I don't think this guy even said sorry.   So we're done with this location.  I'd rather go to ANYwhere else.  I'd rather go to the sonic on Gilbert rd (maybe 10miles away).   Avoid this sonic after 8 too, the lines get HUGE.  We showed up at 730, and it was nearly 8 by the time we left.  The parking lot was still pretty empty, and they don't care....

I frequently visit Fallout just to see if anything catches my eye. The staff is always friendly and they are very knowledgable.  They have a decent selection of old and new games at reasonable prices.  Sometimes they'll have one game a little high, but another on the low side, so it's worth it to drop by to just browse once in a while.  They even let you try out most games before buying.  Totally check these guys out if you're looking for older sega or Nintendo games, they have a ton!
