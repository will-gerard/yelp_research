I am never coming back here. This woman named Demi was so rude to me and would not listen to what I was asking her to do. She copped an attitude with me and said they could not do what I asked her to do. Then, one of the men started to work on my toes and was very nice, and started to do what I asked demi to do originally. Then, she told me I was wrong when I said one of the other techs had done exactly what I was asking 2 months ago. Oh, and when she was trimming my nails she pinched my toe so hard that I almost teared up. When I flinched she did not even apologize. Although I have had good experiences before previously at this salon ad they've always done a good job, I will never go back because of her. Im not usually one to yelp about something, but this place pissed me off so much that I had to.

I went to Rolfs a couple of weeks ago for a partial highlight and a cut. Jessica did my color and it turned out great. She definitely made sure my hair was thoroughly highlighted and not stripey like I requested. She was very easy to talk to and made the long process of highlighting my hair much more bearable (color always takes forever on my hair). Sometimes salons like this can make you feel uncomfortable and "not worthy," but I felt right at home here and like all the staff genuinely cared about my experience from beginning to end.  Sebastian did my cut (four inches off) and it also turned out amazing. I was nervous to cut so much off, but he did such a great job and I love it! He definitely made me feel more at ease for taking so much length off.  I've gotten so many compliments on both my cut and color since my visit to Rolfs. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for quality and the experience of a "Scottsdale" salon without the stuffiness. I will definitely be back!

Besides its convenient location near ASU, this place has nothing going for it. My roommates and I would constantly be told the wrong amount of rent that was due. Even though we paid on time every month, we were constantly getting charged late fees. The appliances were terrible, the disposal in the sink never worked even after the "maintenance" came to fix it, which in turn caused the apartment to have a stench. The air conditioner also dripped, which was a lot of fun when they couldn't fix it.  Again, their excuse for bookkeeping is terrible. While my roommates and I have been moved out for about a month now, we are just now getting charged almost $1,000 for unspecified charges, including the aforementioned "late charges" that we shouldn't have been charged but were because they apparently didn't pass 4th grade math. We paid them anyway because we wanted to be done with this awful place, but they are still saying we didn't pay them. Evidently they just want to drain you of every dollar that you have because they can't keep it straight. We couldn't get out of there fast enough!!  DO NOT LIVE HERE. IT WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO UNTIL YOU DUMP YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS INTO IT. NOT WORTH IT.
