I really enjoyed the brown rice bowl and the sesame ginger dressing. The only issue I had was that the website was jot working and they couldn't seem to tell me the amounts in their food such as portions size. Fabulous for the healthy eater on the go.

It is really difficult to find a Thai place in Phoenix that can compare to this. The food is so full of flavor and appeals to all with pallets  ! My husband loves spicy and I prefer mild and sweet. We both found what we like.  When we first stopped by we were skeptical  , but now  absolutely adore this place.

The food was delicious . The service was terrible. After waiting 20 minutes to put in a food order the server brought us the wrong food and even left out part of our order. When we paid our tab she took the money and never came back . My husband had to sit there for 15 minutes and ask her for our change. The tab was 40 dollars and we gave her a 50. Assuming a 10 dollar tip was pretentious considering the fact that she screwed up the order on a rather slow night. I can look past most things, but coming from someone who used to serve tables , you should always bring back someone's change.

We have been looking for a new Mexican Cantina since our favorite place  changed their menu.  The first thing we noticed was the ample parking . This is a real rare find in Phoenix and makes PAZ a really appealing choice all in itself. The decorum   was well done and the presentation was aesthetically pleasing. We ordered the queso  as an appetizer and really enjoyed that not only did it have a zesty flavor , but also kept the same  creamy consistency throughout the time it took us the finish. As an entree we ordered  the pork belly tacos and the carnitas tacos. The  pork belly was lightly fried and definetely a future favorite. The cilantro and lime  really complimented the carnitas well. We ordered the house margarita which was strong and well made . Definetely worth the price.
