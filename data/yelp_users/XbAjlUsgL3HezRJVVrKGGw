Worst customer service and the owner is horrific! I wouldn't shop there if everything was free

This restaurant was delicious! I couldn't even pick one thing on the menu because everything looked so good! We tried the smoked salmon appetizer, the chopped salad, eggplant torte, and some spaghetti dishes, and all of them were great! The wine was also outstanding! Could be the best pasta in town! We just loved it there!!
