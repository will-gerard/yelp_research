I love this place!  Since moving to Phoenix I miss my favorite Kosher bakeries and am so happy to have found Karsh's.  They have the best Challah bread I've had since I moved here, I love their egg bagels, and the rolls are delicious.  Next time I'm going to try the rye bread.  Their butter cookies are melt in your mouth delicious and the rugelach and decos were delicious.  I was so happy to find an apple strudel like my great grandmother used to make, that even though this place is a drive from me (I'm in E Mesa) I will definitely be making more trips here in the future.

I had lunch here last week with Rand H, Mike C and Norm R after wanting to try this place since I moved to AZ a year and a half ago.  I've been missing my favorite Chicago deli and have been craving some good Jew food and I finally found it!    For lunch I had a brisket sandwich on an onion roll with a side of kishke with gravy. It was excellent!  The beef was tender, flavorful and not dry, and the kishke was sliced,browned and skinless.  This is what I've been waiting for.    While at our table we had a great view of the deli cases and menu boards and I knew I would have to order some food to go for my Mom and for me.  I ordered the Mish mosh soup and that was just okay - the matzo ball was grainy, the kreplach was mostly dough and there was only one of each and no kasha like I'm used to when I order this soup back home.  The chopped liver was good, my Mom and her husband liked it a lot, but I think Don and Charlie's has the best chopped liver in the Phoenix area.  The best thing I brought home was the belly lox!  If I'm going to eat lox, it's going to be the real thing and taste like lox - not the tasteless nova lox that's served to the masses.  It was wonderful and salty and full of flavor and I have enough left for a sandwich tomorrow morning :)  Overall this is the closes to a real Jewish Deli I've been to here in AZ - and I will for sure be back and try the corned beef/pastrami and potato pancakes next time!

This is Olive Garden and I knew what I was getting into when I suggested lunch here.  I knew Rand would be all over the all you can eat pasta and I was right.  The only thing I've ever liked at Olive Garden was the soup and salad and for 6.95 you get all that and breadsticks.  The zuppa tuscana soup had little flavor and the pasta fagioli which has always been my favorite was bland and tasteless.  Even the salad was rather sad, only 1 little piece of tomato and no cucumber.  The ledge of the booth had crumbs on it, and so did the windowsill.  There was scraps of paper on the floor under the table next to us.  Disappointing especially since were were the first table today.  Service was good but I don't think I'll be going back to an Olive Garden anytime soon.

My Mom bought a coupon from somewhere thinking this was just a BBQ restaurant and when her husband wasn't interested, her and I went last Fri night.  With the $25 certificate, it was an additional $39.  Quite pricey for what you get, at least in my opinion.  This is an old time ranch and from what they told us, they used to (still do?) raise thoroughbred horses here.  The grounds are nice, you could see a gazebo and an area with trees that would be nice for a private party.  There were several buildings, for $5? you could "pan for gold", for a few dollars you could shoot a Colt 45.  The young kids around seemed to be enjoying themselves.  My Mom and I wandered to the "Parlour" where there 2 guys playing the fiddle, ukulele and singing.  While they weren't great, they were pretty entertaining.  I noticed most of the people sitting around were seniors.  It wasn't until the show was almost over that Mary (one of the owners?) came around asking if anyone wanted a drink, I guess there was a bar upstairs.  My Mom doesn't do stairs so we never made it up there.    After awhile they let us in the dining/show room that was laid out with rows of picnic style tables.  The emcee, one of the owners talked about the ranch itself, it's history and explained how the food line worked.  You bring your ticket and they give you a tin plate and you walk thru a small line where they plop food onto your plate.  I know they say it's all you can eat, but I don't understand if that's true, why only those who pay extra for a combo plate get both chicken and beef.  A scoop of applesauce, a baked potato, a few slices of mediocre beef covered in BBQ sauce, a spoon of beans and a small square of spice cake.  At the end of the line you take a plastic cup for the lemonade pitchers on the table.  Food was mediocre and certainly not worth the price we paid.  As someone else stated in a review, they do say a prayer before the email and I felt rather uncomfortable.  After the meal you have to bring your dirty dishes and cups to the conveyor belt in the back of the room; while they try and sell you $3 bowls of ice cream.  Ice cream should have been included for the price!!  It was rather awkward during the meal, no music, no entertainment.  You see the performers are in the back scooping the food!!  Just weird.  We had enough and left right after dinner, didn't stay for the show.  All in all it was rather cheesey and pricey.  I could see where this might be fun for kids, but for my Mom and I it was just not really a good time.  I won't be returning, that's for sure!

bland bland bland!  If you like Mexican food with no taste then this is the place to go.  The salsa tasted like tomato sauce, the bean dip had no flavor, and I don't think I've ever had a more tasteless chile relleno in my life.  Not even the pepper had any taste.  The whole plate was covered in cheese and mediocre rice and beans.  I did like the small side of guacamole, the only thing I liked at the table.  The service was lackluster and seemed to match up with the food here.    What I did like was that it sits right on a small lake and I would imagine in nicer weather it would be fun to drink margaritas and sit by the water.

I've driven past this place a dozen times and finally stopped in  yesterday.  They have a very small parking lot and it was packed, had to wait for someone to leave.  But once you enter this small little shop, you're hit with the smell of fresh baked bread.  Who doesn't like that?  They have organic, whole grains bread made on site - and if you don't mind day or 2 old bread, you can pick up loaves for as little 50 cents.  I just love the Apple Cinnamon Whole Wheat bread I picked, was $3.50 for a loaf.  They have all kinds of breads, croissants and a small selection of sweets like cinnamon rolls, scones and brownies.    The store was packed when I was there, would be nice to stop in when it's not so crowded and really take a look around.    The sign out front said they're only open M-F 8am until 2:30pm and closed Sat/Sun, but from reading other reviews it looks like their hours may change all the time.  I'll definitely be back!

After having a problem with my Dyson vacuum not sucking when I used the attachment I made a call into Dyson customer service.  I followed their instructions, and pretty near took the whole vacuum apart trying to find an obstruction.  After all this failed to fix my sucking problem, they referred me to Shav-Tronics an authorized Dyson repair shop.  I called them on Monday and spoke with Steve who told me I could bring my vacuum and there would be a $30 diagnostic charge (applied to the repair).  I brought the vacuum in Tues. morning, Steve plugged it in and said there was a problem with a switch somewhere and they would call by Friday with the problem and an estimate.  Living with 3 cats, I use my vacuum daily, so I was a little annoyed it would take so long to just figure out what the problem was!  (This is why only 4 stars not 5).  He said he would call me if they could get to it sooner.  Not having any other options, I left the vacuum and hoped for sooner rather than later.    Thurs. afternoon Steve called to say the problem was a switch, it would be $66 plus change and would be ready first thing Fri. morning.  Sounds good so I authorized the repair.  The vacuum was ready, but I'm glad I asked Steve to double check, because he had to make an adjustment on the switch for it to work properly.  I asked him to elaborate on the problem and his repair on the receipt so I could submit it to Square Trade for reimbursement.  (I love SquareTrade warranties!)  I love my Dyson and it's now sucking from the floor and the attachment and I'm one happy camper.  I'd for sure go back here again!

This place is a little hard to find, it's way in the back of the Gilbert Towne Center.  I ended up here because I had a fandango gift card and only a couple movie theaters in the area allow online purchasing with it.  That gives them the fourth star ;)  I was early for my movie and you could clearly hear the movie playing in the theater right next to it, I was concerned it would be distracting once my movie started, but it was a non issue.  The seats are as comfy, come with cupholders and from the inside looks like every other theater I've been to recently.  The only drawback here is the last movie of the day is around 7pm.  At least that's true on the current schedule.    I came here for a matinee and it was almost empty - I'll follow the other reviewers notes and not come on a Fri/Sat night.

I shop at different grocery stores for different things and I love shopping at this Sprouts for a few reasons.  First, it's rarely crowded.  Second, I love their bulk containers of dried fruits, trail mix, nuts, grains etc.  I'm only one person and I like the idea I can buy as little (or as much) of something that I need.  I hate having to buy a big box of something and then end up wasting it because it goes bad/stale before I need it again.  The third thing I love about Sprouts is their grass fed beef and when it's on sale, it's not expensive at all!  The last thing I buy here always is their sliced lunch meats, ham and turkey off the bone that are a hundred times better than the deli meats at other stores, and for the same or only a little more money.  They also have great bakery items, I love their onion pocket rolls for sandwiches.  Always fresh.

After eating here quite a bit recently I only felt I had to upgrade them to a 4th star.  I've had a chance to try a bunch of different items, the moo shu was great and was fun to watch her wrap them tableside, I'm a big fan of their egg foo yung and their fried rice has large pieces of meat and/or shrimp.  The roast duck was done very well and they are willing to accommodate special orders. The service is great when you eat in and the portions large enough for leftovers the next day.  Why not 5 stars?  They don't deliver, boo!  And when I order carry out, the dishes are served in those styrofoam containers that don't seal.  This wouldn't be a problem, but if you order anything with gravy or sauce, it's going to leak into the plastic bag they wrap it up in.  Please ... I'd be willing to pay a little extra for a better container!

I am in love with this market.  Amazing selection of fresh produce, local honey, dates, salad dressings, salsas, fruit spreads, beans, nuts, grains.  Shop early to avoid the crowds and really have the best selection of what's offered (before everything is all picked over).  The crowds are insane and it's worth it to get up at 7am to be there when they open.    This morning I bought local made salsa, bulk dried sweet basil, 2lbs of navy beans, 7 apples(honeycrisp and jazz), 4 oranges, 2 red grapefruit, 1# brussel sprouts, 1/2#green beans, 3 tomatoes, 1 cucumber, 1 eggplant, 1 green cabbage, 1# strawberries, packaged organic baby spinach, 2 red bell peppers and 3 onions. $18.54!   A lot of the produce seems "fresh from a farm" as it's dirty, roughly packaged and smells like veggies should. There's always something new (for me) to try - All kinds of peppers, greens, apples of every variety and in the summer - well it's like a fruit orgy ;)  The only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars - sometimes you have to be careful in choosing - especially berries/tomatoes and other softer fruits.  I don't expect perfection, but I expect everything to be fresh, but sometimes what they put out is a little beat up and even starting to turn.  Don't let this stop you, just go here and see.

This place is 3 stores in one, a restaurant, a bakery and a meat market.  I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars and meat market 5+stars.  I've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation a couple friends and I went for a prime rib dinner.  My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there.  No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving.  We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato and a dessert.  The soup was some sort of cream soup that was so gelatinous the spoon stood straight up in the sticky glop, yuck!  Thank God the prime rib was brought out quickly, it was FANTASTIC!  Medium rare, tender, tasty in it's own juice.  Delicious!  It's a good thing we weren't hungry for dessert, it was some sort of pudding that had the same gelatinous appearance as the soup earlier.  Gross.  I've only stopped through the bakery once for some cookies.  Everything is made fresh daily and they'll take special requests for anything including sugar free and low fat items.    Go here for the meat.  I won't even buy grocery store beef since shopping here.  They'll cut anything and everything to your preferences and needs.  They are so helpful and friendly and the best part is the quality of the beef.  Everything is well marbled, fresh and fresh cut and it tastes 100 times better than anything I've bought in a grocery store.  Prices are beyond reasonable especially considering the level of service they provide.    Between this place and the Superstition Ranch Market down the street, I rarely have to shop at a grocery store.

It's an Albertson's and it's close by and it's rarely crowded.  For that I give it 2 stars.  I wouldn't even review a chain grocery store, but every time I shop here I have to avoid the meat display because it smells.  Yes, like rotten meat.  And it's not the whole display, just the part with the ground meat toward the end of the display.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I tried buying chicken here once and fish once.  Both times I just couldn't get over the fact their meat display stinks and I'm sure it affected my feeling about the meats I did buy.  Never again ...  I'll run in for dry goods and they have a decent produce section, but that's about all the shopping I'll ever do here.

I have eaten here several times, both in the dining room and for carry out and I have never had a bad meal or experience here.  I do think it is a little pricey for what you get (a large pizza with a couple ingredients runs about $20), but I don't mind so much because the food has always been very good.  This place is popular during spring training and always crowded - bring in a Cubs ticket stub and they offer a free appetizer plate with garlic bread, cheese sticks and something else I forget.  It's also popular among the senior crowd (my parents LOVE it here) and we always go early before the dinner rush.  Tonight was the first time I've had the pizza and I can't believe it took me so long.  YUM!  I haven't eaten much pizza since I've been here, but this is easily the best I've had so far.  I had an email coupon for buy one pizza get one free, so my Mom and her husband I went for dinner tonight.  We had a margherita pizza that was a good balance of cheese and sauce, I wish there were more fresh basil on top though.  Add a little crushed red pepper and my mouth was happy!  The other pizza we had was black olive, 1/2 sausage and 1/2 pepperoni.  Not bad, my Mom and her husband loved it, but I thought the margherita was much better.  I'm also a fan of their sunrise sauce, an alfredo sauce with a light touch of tomato.  It does get loud in the restaurant, this isn't the place for a quiet dinner.  They have an enclosed outside seating area but it looks right onto the parking lot.  I just noticed tonight that they now have a drive thru for carry-out orders, so that is very convenient because the parking lot gets full early.

I'm a fan!  Maybe it's because I'm from Chicago and Carson's Ribs was a favorite of mine.  I've had great steaks and ribs from here and believe it or not, their mustard crusted salmon is one of my favorite fish dishes anywhere.  I wish their au-gratin potatoes were a little cheesier though.    My favorite thing about Don and Charlie's is the complimentary chopped liver plate they serve before your meal.  Chopped liver is served with chopped egg and onion and is the best I've had here in AZ.  I always get an extra 1/2 lb to take home.  If you come here during spring training expect the place to be jam packed and rowdy.  You'll probably see more than a few baseball players here also.  It's not the place to come for a leisurely dinner in March.  Other times of the year it's not so bad, and it's easier to wander around and take in all the baseball memorabilia.  It really is like a baseball museum!

I bought a Group on here and stopped in a week ago to finally use it before it expired.  I loved the atmosphere, it reminded me of my party days!  The sandwiches were very good and toasted, the bread was MUCH better than what you find at any of the chains.  The veggies were fresh and the meats were tasty.  I wasn't a fan of the brownies, they tasted like box mix.  I'm sure I'll stop in for a sandwich again next time I'm in the mood for a fresh made sub.

I've been here twice for their Broadway shows (Thank you Lindsey and Yelp!) and I really like this place.  I sat on the first tier both times and could see and hear everything.  The theater is not too big, the seats are large and roomy and I love that there is enough space between rows for people walking through.  I'm not sure if they don't allow you in after the show has started, but neither time were there people walking in front of us at the beginning or after intermission.    It seems to be pretty easy to find discounted tickets for most shows here as well, I've seen them on showup.com, travelzoo.com and maybe even the ticket website.  One of the best parts of seeing shows here is FREE parking.  There is a lot right outside the building, but both times we used the parking garage that wasn't even 2 blocks away.  Easy in and easy out.  I didn't use the bathrooms during intermission, but after the show there wasn't any line at all.    I just bought tix to see Fiddler on the Roof here in the Spring, I think my Mom and her husband will love it!

After looking for a nice restaurant off strip for a group for lunch, we ended up at Pane Vino.  My local friends were thinking we would just have lunch at the deli, but to our surprise the main restaurant was open.  What a beautiful space!  Interesting curvy windows that face the strip and the airport.  The decor was warm and inviting.   Right in the middle of the restaurant is what appears to be a support pole but is a mosaic lady's leg, although I'm not sure you would realize what it was from a different angle.  I am sure at night this is a very romantic space (2 members of our group got engaged there), and it is definitely upscale.  Our party had just come from wine-making and we were casually dressed and a bit rowdy, but that didn't affect the service or our welcome one bit.  It's funny that the other reviewers mentioned the choice of napkins because I made comment to my friend that I loved them!  We all had white napkins, but they were so nicely textured and such high quality - okay I have a thing for linens - that I knew we were in for a treat.  The service was excellent and our 2 waiters had a great sense of humor, although we did not get the table dance we asked for, the cute blond waiter did do a little Irish jig for us!    They had a nice variety of wines by the glass to choose from and reasonably priced at most under $10 a glass.  They brought out fresh breads served with a small dish of olive oil and topped with balsamic.  I had the linguine with seafood, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops in a light and fresh tomato based sauce.  It was wonderful, especially the scallops that just about melted in my mouth.  Yum!  Nice sized portion, I didn't finish all the pasta, but there wasn't enough to take for later.  The dessert menu read like the best food porn, but we had homemade cherry port and chocolate brownies waiting for us at our friends, so we passed.   It was a great meal, with excellent service in a comfortable space - I can't wait to go back for dinner and check out the view as well.

Delicious!!  Lynn W and I had a late lunch here after watching a Fall league baseball game at HoHoKam.  I've been wanting to stop in forever, especially since it's so close to home.  I had the Carne Asada plate (fajitas, although nothing like any fajitas I've ever had) and it was awesome.  The meat was marinated and char grilled, so tender and so so tasty.  I loved that the peppers and onions were also char grilled, no grease puddle like other places.  The rice was flavorful and beans were some of the best I've ever had.    I had the raspberry margarita and it was so very good.    I'll definitely be back here again!

Was here this past Sunday at a UYE with about 10 of us sharing a table.  One of the first things I noticed was the bright orange/gold chair covers with white tablecloths on the tables.  There were a LOT of tables and quite a few of the women walking around with huge carts of all kinds of Dim Sum.  I'm sure glad I was there with people who knew what they were ordering; this was my first time doing Dim Sum and I had no clue at all what was going on.  I'm really not that much of an adventurous eater, I passed on the tripe and the chicken feet.  I did like everything I ate especially the sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, the pork buns, and the custard.    What a value this was too.  I thought we had a huge amount of food and for the price of only $10 a person including tip, I thought more than reasonable.  I was prepared to pay twice that amount.  Maybe I shouldn't give them any ideas. hah!  Regardless, it was a great experience and a whole lot of fun.  Can't wait for the next UYE Dim Sum :)

This was a great place to go with the parents for Thanksgiving.  Dinner was served family style and it was a ton of food!  Started with a plate of 3 different bruschetta appetizers that were excellent.  Then had a choice of 2 salads, 2 meats - we had turkey that was served with a focaccia dressing and the tilapia served with a side of some of the best creamed spinach I ever had - then 2 side dishes in addition - mashed sweet potatoes and mashed garlic potatoes that were just okay - 2 pasta dishes - we had the signature Rigatoni D and the angel hair with pomodoro sauce/sausage - and 2 desserts!  It is a little pricey, but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers, I think it's worth it.  The best way to go here is with a group and do the family style menu.  I've been to other Maggiano's in Chicago and to me, they're all pretty much the same - good and plentiful food and fast friendly service.

Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.  They are a little slow getting the food out at opening time, but everything was fresh and tasty and a good variety.  The already dressed salad had a great sweet dressing, pineapple something or other and it was a great start to the meal.  One of the things I like best about this buffet is the variety of foods they offer - chicken, veggie, pork, beef as well as rice and noodle dishes.  I'd prefer more of the items to have a little heat; the only spicy thing I tried was the panang chicken.    The food is good, they serve real iced tea with the buffet as well.  Service was good and the company was better!  I'm sure I'll be back.

Bought a groupon here about 6 months ago and like most that I buy, I always wait until the last minute to redeem them.  My groupon expired the 24th (Thanksgiving) and I called for my appointment on 21st.  They were able to get me in the next day and didn't seem irritated that I waited until the last minute like some other places do.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they are rather pricey.  I paid $50 for a groupon that included an eye exam, $150 toward a pair of glasses and 30% off a second pair.  I needed 2 pair and still paid over $550!    I arrived early for my appointment, the office and waiting area are beautifully decorated and all the staff were friendly and helpful.  I looked around at the frames on display, all designer frames and in the price range of $300-$500 just for the frames!  When I expressed a need for something less expensive they were more than accommodating and the optician brought me several frames in the $99-$125 range.  This was all before I even saw the Dr for my exam!  She was extremely helpful and it didn't take long to pick out 2 frames for the glasses I would be buying.  I was then called for my eye exam and I was very impressed with the thoroughness.  Dr Minor took all the time I needed to go over my options for lenses, I need a different prescription for distance, computer and reading.  He was helpful and understanding and we finally decided I'd get a pair of computer only glasses (I spend most of my day at the computer) and a second pair of bifocals for distance/reading.    Back out to the optician to go over options for lenses.  No hard sell on upgrades, she gave me my options and suggestions for each pair, ie: no glare, scratch resistant, transition lenses etc.  I felt very comfortable in the lenses and frames we picked out.  They said it would take about a week or more for the glasses to be ready, and considering the holiday weekend, I was surprised when they called yesterday telling me they were ready.  Stopped in this morning and picked up my glasses, had them fitted and they were perfect.  They each came in one of those hard eyeglass cases that were so cute!  She also gave me some eyeglass cleaner and a cleaning cloth and told me to come in anytime if I needed them adjusted.  They also offer sonic cleaning of glasses and I could stop in once a month or so at no charge for a cleaning.  Overall I am very happy with the service and the glasses, just wish they weren't so expensive here.

Stopped in here a couple weeks using a groupon I purchased for $40 worth of meats.  The man behind the counter was friendly and more than helpful, explaining the different grades of meat that they carry.  Excellent service!  I bought 2 strip steaks that I threw on the grill that night and they were right up there in the top 5 steaks I've ever had.  Good marbling, plenty of flavor and as fresh as I could ask for.  And these weren't even the "prime" grade steaks.  I also picked up some awesome looking short ribs and ground beef.  But what I was most excited about - they carry Vienna hot dogs and condiments!  Being from Chicago, I was so happy to find this taste of home.  I picked up a lb of hot dogs and a bottle of the Vienna hot giardianera.  Now this is what giardianera should taste like.  They also had the neon green relish and mustard, but I'm not a big fan of either no matter what the brand.    This place is a little far from me (I'm in E Mesa) but I will definitely be making another visit soon.

I know you're thinking Jiffy Lube? 5 stars?  Well maybe not all Jiffy Lubes deserve this rating, but the guys at this place sure do!  Sure, they might be priced higher than other oil change places, but for service like this, I don't mind paying a little more.  Plus, if you go online you can always find coupons for $$ off!    What I like best about his place? They offer free top offs of your oil in between changes, and when you have a crappy car like mine that burns oil, this is huge.  And when I get a top off, at no charge, they still check my tires, wash my windows and be sure the other fluids are properly filled.    They don't ever try and bully me into buying other products or services, and when I do need to have an air filter changed, they keep notes so they don't ask every time.    The guys at this place are super nice and efficient and I'll keep going back!

Obviously I'm one of the few who likes this place, but I just judge it for it is.  I don't come here expecting authentic Mexican food or a fine dining experience.  I do come here for tasty margaritas and the poblano chicken dinner, which is the only food I've ever ordered from here.  It's a chicken and cheese stuffed poblano pepper, breaded and fried and covered with their bajai sauce.  Now I know the bajai sauce is nothing more than cream (sour cream?), cream cheese and jalapeno juice, but it sure is yummy!  Quite addictive and no way it's good for you, but I just can't help myself.  The chips and salsa they serve when you sit down are good, they offer a mild and a hotter sauce and I like them both just fine.  I love the patio they have overlooking a small "lake".  It's a great place to hang out and drink margarita's.  I have always had good service here.  I've been here many times over the years and I'm sure I'll be back again!

I love this place.  It's only 20 minutes from my house and was the first place I started to hike when I moved here.  They have trails for beginners (like me) that are an easy mile on a smooth trail around the small mountain (hill?).  When I first came here over a year ago, this easy trail was all I could handle, and even that was difficult for me.  Fast forward a year and I have hiked most of the trails here and even did the (not so for me) easy Wind Cave Trail that's 1.6 miles up and then back down.  For the experienced hiker I'm sure it's easy, but we're not all experienced.  It's still challenging, there are a few places that I have to "climb" a rock, but the view from the top is worth it!  Just be careful of the bees on top.  I love how everyone is so friendly on the trails and encouraging, and it's a huge reason I keep going back.  They also have a Nature Center here, and have lots of programs for kids, and for adults.  I've done guided moonlight hikes here and they offer programs on scorpions, desert plants and more.  Ranger B is fun, entertaining and has a ton of knowledge about the park and surrounding area.  Innervision Yoga offers classes here on Mon nights, and Tues/Thurs/Sat mornings and it's a wonderful place to practice.  You're looking out the windows of the Nature center and the beautiful desert scenery so it's peaceful and serene.  These are all levels classes and when they say they welcome beginners, they aren't kidding!  Everyone here has been so supportive and encouraging and I can't ever thank them enough for what they've done for me :)  I have to give a special mention to Jennifer, who is the manager of Usery Park, she is not only knowledgeable and friendly, but is one of the kindest and most supportive people I have met.  She is always smiling, always positive  and always has something good to say.    If you're in the east valley you owe it to yourself to check out Usery Park, there is truly something for everyone here!

I love the food here.  The salsa is some of the best I've ever had, dark in color with a little heat, it holds up well to the complimentary chips they serve.  I always seem to order the same thing every time, the Spooning Rellenos, beef tenderloin stuffed chile's and always Christmas style with red and green sauce. YUM!  They must have several different chefs, because every time I order this,  it's served just a little different.  I've had the 2 rellenos served one with green and one with red sauce; other times the red/green sauce poured on top of each relleno and other times 1/2 of each covered with a different sauce. Weird - but it still tastes great.  If you come here in during Spring Training, be prepared for a long wait, otherwise I've never had a problem.

Disgusting is the only word I can think of for this food.  Perfectly square orange colored deep fried fish that makes McDonalds fish filets seems like a gourmet meal!  The only thing resembling shrimp was the fact that they formed the fried "shrimp" into the proper shape.  After taking one bite of fish and one of shrimp I thought at least I have the french fries to eat.  They were nasty too!  I wasn't expecting anything fancy by any means, I came her because I wanted greasy fried fish and shrimp and the only part of that I got was grease.  I just don't understand the love for this place.

Gross.  If you like your food sitting in pool of grease then you'll love this place.  It just was not good.  Potatoes were cold, the meats were just okay, but once I saw the puddle of grease, that was it for me.    Never again.

Make your own wine in Las Vegas!  What a great concept this is and soooo much fun.  This isn't like other wine-making places I've been to that just have you do some blending and bottling - here you actually make the wine from the crush to the bottling.  Charlie is the owner here and from what I understand, he actually goes to CA and chooses the grapes to made available.  I believe this year there was a choice of 16 different grapes (I could be wrong) but we had to choose our varietals the first part of Sept.  Each group makes a minimum of one barrel, 20 cases/240 bottles, for $2400.  Last year we made a Zinfandel blend with Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon.  It was so good we won 3rd place in the Zin category.  The Zin grapes came from Suisun Valley, the others from Amador.  This year we're making a Barbera blend with Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.  We had our crush yesterday - 21 crates of wine that we dump into the machine that separates the stems from the rest.  The stems go on the floor and rest in a huge tub.  Add the yeast and the other stuff that makes wine *I should know this but I forgot* and they explain the process in detail.  If you're local, they ask you to come back and plunge the wine before it is pressed - then come for the press when they move your wine from the tub to a barrel.  The wine sits in the barrel until May when we bottle, cork and label the wine ourselves and take it home!   They have all kinds of events through the year as well for their clients - we went to a port party, they take part in the Henderson St Pat's day parade, and in August is the awards dinner for all of us wine-makers.  Everyone brings bottles of their wine and trades - of course everyone wants the award winning wines to trade for.    All in all it's a great experience, even more fun and the best part is having 20 cases of wine to drink!

I was here with Lynn W Sat night for dinner and I've been dreaming about the food ever since.  The decor is simple and clean and the space is small.  This is an upscale Thai restaurant and is pricier than most.  They do have a lunch menu with smaller portions (and prices) as well.  I also notice the actual menu had more items than the .pdf on their website.  We started off the lettuce wraps that our waitress said would be spicy.  They were very tasty, but there was no spice at all to either of us.  For my main dish I had the Musaman short ribs and they were sooooooooo good!  Tender pieces of short ribs, in a bowl with a peanut curry.  But it was so much more than that.  There were cinnamon sticks so there was a sweetness, there was a little heat/spice and the flavor, wow the flavor was amazing.  I could bathe in this stuff.  I think it would taste great over ice cream too.  I wish they sold the sauce by the quart, it was that good.  The plate was served with a side of jasmine rice, enough to soak up all the extra peanut curry sauce.    The service was good, the owner even came over to chat with us at the end of our meal.  He said his mother was the chef, and I saw her pop in an out of the kitchen several times.    I can't wait to go back!!

Honey Bleu Cheese ice cream.  I loved it!  But then again one of my favorite snacks is good bleu cheese drizzled with honey on crusty bread.  The ice cream did not disappoint.  I bought a pint to go and a pint of the salted caramel, which was good, not great.  Not nearly as good as the Honey Bleu Cheese.  The ice cream is high quality, and it should be for $7.50 a pint!  That's the only reason I don't give them 5 stars.  It is pricey for what is - ice cream.    I'll be back for a special treat, but it's not something I can afford on a regular basis.

Oh my!!  Not only was this some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in Phoenix, but it's rates right up there with some the best food ever!  And for cheap!    Met up here for lunch today with Rand H, Mike C and Arlin B and even though it's in a crappy part of town, it was well worth it.  We started with some of the little pies, we had the meat, and the spinah/cheese.  Different than other pies I have had at Middle Eastern places, these were made with a tasty dough instead of the layered sheets of whatever they use.  The fillings were seasoned and fantastic, so good I bought a dozen to take home!  99cents for one, 8.99 a dozen, how can you beat that price?! We also all shared a plate of hummus that was delicious, creamy and tasted like hummus should.    For my meal I ordered the beef shawerma plate, but was already full from the other goodies I brought most of it home.  While the meat looked like it was burnt, it was nothing but tender and seasoned just right.  Oh...and everything came with what seemed a stack of fresh made pitas!    Hours later I'm still in that happy food coma place and I'm already planning my next visit.

This review is for their tamales only.  I haven't been to this location, I bought mine at the Phoenix Public Market.  OMG these are some of the best tamales I've ever had!!  I've tried the beef with red chile, the green chile chicken, the chicken chipotle and green chile corn cream cheese.  There was plenty of filling and you could even tell by looking at it, what it was filled with.  The taste was amazing, and spiced nicely.  They heat in 2 minutes in the microwave (I left them in the paper wrapper and corn husk) and they steamed inside to a perfect moist and hot tamale for your eating pleasure.  These tamales are exactly the way all tamales should be!  I am happy to know I can buy these at the Mesa Farmers Market on Fridays without having to go all the way downtown.  You can be sure I'll stock up again!

I've been here a few times now, twice using coupons from one of the deal a day sites.  Service was always friendly, not always fast (only one person behind the counter and a few customers waiting)  The ice cream is wonderful and they'll give you taste samples of anything you want, but what I really love to buy when I shop here is the butter.  Local farm fresh cream butter!  I've had the honey butter (their best!), the vanilla butter, the chocolate butter and the garlic butter.  I've tried their farmers cheeses a couple times, the chipotle and the port wine w/caramelized onions.  Yummy!  I just wish I had more ideas of what to do with it.  I love supporting this local shop and one of these days soon I'm going to have to hit up Superstition Farms and their new Thurs night Farmers Market.  If you're in the area, I highly recommend a visit here!

I've had this place on my radar for a long time, not many place to get Chicken Vesuvio here in Phoenix.  I stopped in a few weeks for an early dinner and had high expectations.  The decor is a bit outdated, the front room is mainly a bar, but we were seated at a table in the back room with dark furniture, the plastic red/white check tablecloths.  Nothing fancy here at all.  They run a happy hour daily from 3-7 so we started our meal with 1/2lb of mussels in a spicy white wine sauce for $5.  They are were sooooo good!!  I'd have liked the wine sauce spicier, but it was quite tasty.  I had read another review complaining about the lack of bread, but all we had to do was ask and they brought a small loaf of warmed bread to soak up the sauce. Our waitress even offered more bread when we finished the first.  Ordered the Chicken Vesuvio for our entrees and I'm sad to say I was a little disappointed.  I prefer this dish served with chicken on the bone, just has more flavor, but this was served with 2 small'ish chick breasts that seemed more of the "food service" kind than fresh chicken.  The vesuvio sauce was really good and garlicy, although after eating the mussels, it just wasn't the stand out I was hoping for.  We finished with a cannoli, and our waitress was upfront that it wasn't homemade, but thought we'd try it anyway.  It was too sweet and sugary and not what a real cannoli should be like.  I was warned, and next time I'll listen!  I'm definitely coming back for mussels and want to try their linguine with clams in the spicy white sauce.

What a fun place!  Fortunately I knew it was IN the Antiques Marketplace because I read all the reviews last night.  As soon as you walk into the Marketplace, you can smell the hot dogs cooking!  Walk towards the left, pass by aisles of "antiques", and once you see all the Pittsburgh sports stuff and a few tables, you've found Pittsburgh Willies.  Rand and I had a seat while we were waiting for Lynn and Claire and met Randy the owner.  Very friendly and a gracious host.  Being from Chicago and growing up on Chicago style hot dogs, I was a little unsure about some of the weird combinations on the menu, so I played it safe and went with the 3 Legged Chili and Cheese - almost 1/2 lb of Big Willy sliced in 3 - over a split sesame bun and covered in chili with big pieces of beef and lots of cheese!  Yum!  The hot dog was good quality and the chili was better than I expected.  Had a side of potato salad that was pretty good also.  They have a refrigerator case for your drinks, cans of soda are only $1.  They also had glass bottles of Coke and Pepsi.  On Wed they have homemade potato and cheese pierogis and Randy said to call ahead if you're not coming until the evening because they almost always run out before they close at 7pm.    Take a stroll through the Antiques Marketplace after lunch.  They said it's the largest one in Arizona!

What an amazing drive this is!  I drive east from home on Main St to State Rte 88 and in about 30 minutes I'm away from the city and suburbs and into the most beautiful and amazing scenery around.    The first part of the drive is fairly easy on paved roads - there are a couple stops for scenic views, the first to view Weaver's needle and the second a great view of Canyon Lake.  I do this part of the drive at least once a month, I have a great need to see "big" water.  Drive a little further and you end up at Tortilla Flat - there's a restaurant/bar, an ice cream store and a souvenir shop.  If you do this on the weekends in the winter expect major crowds here.  Past Tortilla Flat the road is still paved for a more miles and then it gets good.  The unpaved road is graded and can be an uncomfortable drive and I'm sure it's not good for my car, but I just can't resist.  Keep driving the curvy road and be careful, in many places it's just one lane and a lot of the other drivers seem to want to speed on by.  The scenery is magnificent though and worth every mile.  Soon you'll hit Apache Lake - and if you drive down to the marina? there is a building with a restaurant (looks kinda dumpy), a small store and they have boat rentals!  Something I will have to do one summer.  Keep driving and the water continues on your left until you hit Roosevelt Dam.  If you're not expecting it, it's a very large dam and just seems to pop out of nowhere.  But for me the best part is just 'round the bend when you see the suspension bridge and Roosevelt Lake, HUGE water!  I'm from Chicago and lived near Lake Michigan, and as much as I love the mountains, I really do miss seeing water.  It's almost breathtaking once you get this far.    Once you've reached the end, for me the best way is to head toward Globe and get on 60W to head back to the Valley.  I've gone the other way through Payson and it's a much longer ride (or so it seems)  Be sure you have a full tank of gas before you start this trip, there are no gas stations and it's several miles past Roosevelt Lake before you see one.

With an upcoming move I knew I had to hire a moving company so I went searching on Yelp and found Just-In Time Movers.  I called and spoke with Justin the owner (what a cute play on his name, Justin, Just-In Time) and he was very nice and more than helpful.  After telling him I found them on Yelp I got a 15% discount on their hourly rate, $72 an hour for 2 men.  Other reviews speak about how pricey this is, but coming from Chicago, this is a deal!!    I had a bunch of moving blankets from my move here that I had been unable to sell, and Justin was more than helpful in letting me trade the blankets for boxes and tape.  So far so good.  When Justin came to deliver the boxes and pick up the blankets, I showed him around and what I had to move - he guesstimated about 4 hours plus the additional hour travel time.  Now I know the hour travel time is usual and customary for any mover, but it really bugs me when moving companies do this especially since I was moving only one block away.  (I was even charged this by another company when I hired them just to unload a truck at my residence when I moved to AZ)  I was a little unsure about how long it would actually take, I had a feeling it would be longer than his estimate, but he assured me his guys would hustle and get the job done.  We scheduled for this past Friday at 7am.  I did need to call Justin with several questions before the move and he was more than patient and helpful.  Thursday night he called and asked if they could make it at 8am instead of 7am and that was no problem, who doesn't need a little extra sleep before moving?  Friday morning comes and I get a call that they're running 15-30 min late and they showed up about 8:15am.  The 2 guys (Cory and Mark?) were very nice and I showed them all I had to move.  Justin was right, they sure did hustle and they really did work as fast as they could.  They were even patient when I had a missing cat, to take care to keep an eye out so he didn't run out.  These guys were not slackers, they busted their butts to keep things going.  But I was right and the move itself took just under 6 hours with 2 guys, plus the additional travel time, came out a bit more than I had budgeted.  They put everything where I wanted it, and even moved a few things around for me, I have no problem at all with the actual movers, they did their job and were nice and friendly!  I did end up with a missing pull knob on one of my nightstands (I still haven't found it) but other than that, everything was moved with great care and not damaged.  They did seem rushed at the end of the job, having another job to head to right after mine.  I think if the job was estimated better, I should have had a 3 man team to move to stay within the time frame.    Not that it matters, but in the photos for this business I see under my review as I'm typing, they show a Just-In Time Moving Truck - my movers showed with a Budget Rental Truck.  Again the only reason for not 5 stars - the job not being estimated properly, a missing pull knob and the late start.  Would I use them again?  Yes for sure, but I would insist that my estimate of time and men would be more accurate.  If I could rate in increments, they were better than 3 stars, not quite a 4 star, but for patience and attitude, I gave them the benefit of rounding up!

This review is for the Sunday Jazz Brunch Buffet.  This past Sunday I got together with Mike C, Rand H and Arlin B for this wonderful brunch.    Technically I'd give this review 4.5 stars - if you are a small party (less than 8) they try and seat you in one of those half oval booths.  It would be nice and comfortable for a sit down meal, but makes getting in and out for a buffet a little more difficult.  Fortunately they were able to accommodate us with a small table.  The Sun buffet brunch is reasonably priced at $19.99 and includes coffee, tea and soft drinks.  Orange juice is $2 extra and mimosa's are $5.  But don't let that stop you from coming here for the food.  They have a nice selection of italian deli meats, cheeses, roasted veggies and more items for salad.  The roasted veggies were really good and a nice touch from raw and/or overcooked veggies you find other places.  Compared to other brunch buffets the selections aren't as many, but I think the quality is far above the rest.  The star of the meal was the prime rib; and not just a tiny thin slice, they will slice it nice and thick at your request.  They offer a creamy horseradish sauce with it, but it needed more horseradish as it tasted mostly like sour cream.  The scalloped potatoes were fantastic and the peas with pearl onions and bacon rounded out the plate.  Delicious!!  The have an omelet station but after the prime rib, that would have been overkill.  A small selection of okay desserts rounded out the meal.   The room is dark wood, just as you might expect in a steak house - and they have a lovely outside seating area as well.  I think if it were 5-10 degrees warmer, I would much rather have sat outside.  I love the jazz duet, they weren't too loud and it was a nice accompaniment to our meal.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here again!

Fresh sliced beef brisket, grilled salmon, veggies right off the grill, fresh housemade potato chips that are served warm, clam chowder with clams, some of the best pot stickers I've ever had and much, much more is what you'll find at The Buffet at Harrahs Ak Chin resort.  Oh I can't forget about the desserts, mango sorbet, watermelon ice, bread pudding and so much more.  Easily one of the best, if not the best buffet in the Phoenix area.  I can't forget to mention the service - our server Sheryl was friendly, efficient and made sure our plates were cleared and drinks were filled.  Not only that, even the people working behind the food counters were nice and some of the most polite food service workers ever.    The only thing better than the food was the company of Rand H, Jeromy H, Norm R and Mike C.    Since I had never been here/played at Harrahs AkChin before, I scored a FREE buffet too!  woot!

This is my favorite Fresh and Easy of the ones I've been.  It's rarely crowded and all the employees are super friendly.  I find their meat selection to be pretty good and the quality seems better than what I buy at Frys/Albertsons/Safeway.  The best thing I like about F&E are their branded grocery items.  Cheaper than the average store and better tasting.  I like that the store is small, easy in and easy out.  I hate having to deal with a huge supermarket when I only need a few things.  I just wish they had a bigger selection of paper products

I am in love.  For as long as I can remember I have had a love/hate relationship with pie.  I love pie filling of any kind, I like graham cracker crusts, but when it comes to a pastry crust, I had not found one I liked.  Not ever until I had pie from Croshaw's.  Seriously, this is the most amazing pie crust, light, flaky, moist, *sigh* I just wish I could better explain how good the crust was on the chocolate cream pie.  I didn't have to scoop the cream because every bite of perfect crust and chocolate just melted in my mouth.  And for a mini pie at $3.89, this is a bargain.  Most whole pies here are under $10 and worth at least twice that much.  I also brought home a chicken pot pie and for someone who would only eat the chicken filling, I thought the crust was the best part of it.  Compared to the crust, I found the chicken and veggies to be a little bland.   I would buy it again just for the crust, and try the turkey pot pie instead.  I just did carry out, but they have a nice little seating area, sandwiches, salads, soups and quiche.  If those items are even half as good as the pies you are in for a treat.  I also brought home a blueberry cobbler.  The filling was your run of the mill sweet syrupy blueberries but the topping was light, lightly sugared and so so good!  I'd buy the pastry topping by itself if I could.  For the mini chocolate cream pie, chicken pot pie and blueberry cobbler, my bill was $12.14.  This is a bargain and I will be back soon!

It's the best of the fast food hamburgers.  I'm not crazy about their fries they're never done enough and I always forget to order them well done.  For the food, I'd only give them 3 stars but they earn the extra star on customer service.  The last 2 times I've gone through the drive-thru they have a real person taking orders.  I love this!  So much better than talking into a speaker.  I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm craving a quick burger.

I've been here a couple times and from reading other reviews, I must have come on a good night!  Both times I was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They have a large rock pit? in the middle that they light when it's cold for heat.    I really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette.  The service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just don't see how that is sanitary especially if they're walking in the kitchen.    Overall it was good and I'm sure I'll be back.  I keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 1/2 price appetizers!  A bowl of mussels and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is all I need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner.

With over 150 items (thanks Rand) there is something for everyone here.  Mongolian BBQ, sushi and all the usual dishes you would find on a Chinese buffet.  The food was fresh, hot and some of the best I've had in a long while.  I tried a little bit of a lot of things and there wasn't anything I didn't like.  In the beef dishes the meat was tender and not fatty - the chicken dishes had chicken breast and it wasn't dry - the shrimp entrees were cooked well, no rubbery shrimp that were too small to find or taste.  The vegetables were fresh and nothing was too greasy.  The service was excellent as well.  They kept our water glasses and my soda filled, they cleared the used plates quickly and we had all the napkins we would need.  They even brought a knife to the table when I forgot to pick one up at the buffet station.   It may not be all "authentic" Asian food, but it sure tasted good to me.  Something for everyone and at $7.95 for the lunch buffet, you just can't beat the price.

Just barely 4 stars and that's because the food was very good.  Went here for the lunch buffet today with Rand H, Norm R and Mike C.  The buffet is small, but with lots of yummy stuff.  I only wish I knew what most of it was because nothing was labeled.  When we asked our waiter? what kind of soup, he said he didn't speak English but would go to the back and find out; it was lentil soup, and it was very good.   There was hummus, baba ghannoush and a couple other unknown dips to eat with the delicious homemade pita bread.  Check out Norm R's photos of the puffy pita pockets - they tasted as good as they looked!  There were stuffed peppers, chicken on the bone and a couple platters of red sauce - one had beans and an unknown meat - another had squash? with what seemed to be lamb meatballs.  I just wish they had some sort of dessert other than the canned fruit cocktail and some sort of pudding? that tasted good, but again, we had no idea what it was.  Baklava would have been the perfect ending to the meal.    The service was almost non existent, the music was a little too loud for lunch even after Rand asked them to turn it down a bit, and not only did we have to chase them down for our check, we actually paid standing at the waiter station.    I did check out their regular menu and while everything looks good, it seems a little pricey.  The lunch buffet was reasonably priced at $9.95.

The location on Main St is now closed and moved to 63 N. Greenfield Rd. Ste 101 MESA, AZ 85205.  It is what it is - cheap pizza delivered.  It's one of the few places that delivers to my address and for that they get the 3rd star and a 4th star because they are always quick and friendly.  I'm not comparing the pizza to "good" pizza, but when I have a taste for greasy and salty pizza, Papa John's fills the need cheap and quick.  What more could I ask?

The only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars was the service.  It's not that the service was bad, just slow.  The waitstaff was busy, I just think they needed another waiter or 2.  They also have the most uncomfortable plastic chairs!  They don't have a wine list here, but they will bring you samples of a few wines to try which was a very nice touch.  I think we sampled 4 different wines before choosing a bottle of the Dirt Red.  2 of the 3 us picked this as our favorite.  On to the food!  It was delicious!!  We started with appetizers - the curry soup, the house salad and the cream/goat cheese with pesto.  The soup was fantastic and the pesto was some of the best I've ever had.  You could tell it was fresh, not made with fillers and it was not nearly enough to go with the huge piece of cheese.  We asked for a little more pesto and our waiter brought a small dish with plenty for all of us.  For the main course, we had the vegetable curry, the jerk baked fried chicken and the shredded pork with red chiles.  Everything had great flavor and was a huge portion (we all brought home leftovers).  Our waiter forgot to bring our side of corn, but that was okay after we saw the size of our meals.    We did splurge on dessert and went with the cake sampler platter; a slice of carrot, chocolate and red velvet cake.  Now for a sampler, we expected to each have a taste of each flavor, but nooooo, it seemed like there were 3 almost full slices of cake on the plate.  All the flavors were good, but not spectacular.  I'd skip this next time easily.  I for sure will come back here next time I'm in Vegas, it's not that far off the strip and well worth the drive!

After spending a couple hours at this buffet at a mini UYE for lunch today, I almost feel like I should downgrade every other buffet I've rated 5 stars to 4, because this one is as good as it gets.  It's definitely more upscale than The Buffet at Harrah's, both in atmosphere and food.  The dining room is separate from the buffet area and has large windows facing the Scottsdale Mountains.  The service was top notch, our plates were cleared quickly and drinks and water refilled often.  The food was excellent!  I started with salads, the spinach salad had fresh raspberries!  They even had fresh bleu cheese to go along with the bleu cheese dressing.  The fried calamari was some of the best I've had, not greasy, lightly breaded and even after sitting out tasted fresh and not rubbery at all.  There was a fantastic selection of cheeses and charcuterie served with dried fruits and veggies.  The smoked salmon and the baked salmon were perfect - and the prime rib of beef was done just right.    I can't forget the awesome dessert spread - the sticky toffee pudding was delicious (I wish I had another dish of it right now) and the gelatos, blood orange, mango and limoncello were the perfect end to a great meal.    I will have to come back for the Sunday brunch, the only thing that would make this better is unlimited mimosas and bloody marys!  And I left with $200 extra in my pocket!

I loved this place!  It's like going to your Thai Mother's house for lunch, but better.  I was here a week ago with Norm R and Rand H and we all agreed it was a wonderful experience with fantastic food.  It really did feel like you were eating in someone's home.  They say it's a buffet, but it's so much more than that.  For $7.50 a person ($10 each including a diet coke for me and tip) this place is definitely a bargain.  Don't let the outside fool you either, it may not look like much on the outside, but they put all their effort into the food and service.  It's not the typical buffet where you serve yourself from 100 items - our first course was served to us - a plate of papaya salad, chicken and pork satay, jerk beef and sticky rice.  I could have just had all that and been satisfied.  But no, there is more.  We walked up to the counter and they made our plates cafeteria style, a little of this a little of that and more of all the rest.  Yellow curry, a noodle dish, a veggie dish with eggplant, fried rice, jasmine rice and more that I don't even know what it was.  I'm not usually an adventurous eater, but everything tasted great!  Just when we were about full and done - there's even more food!  Served to us at the table was a plate of coconut ice cream, homemade pumpkin custard and lychee with sticky rice and a cup of hot tea.  OMG unbelievably good, my mouth is watering just remembering how delicious the food was.  The most amazing part was they offered to make us other food that wasn't even on the buffet and suggested if we wanted something special to call ahead and they would prepare it for us next time.  This little place is all about service and homemade food.  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks Norm for turning me on to this place!

This review is based on the pork products I picked up at the Mesa Farmers Market.  I understand they have a restaurant opening soon, and I'll for sure have to check it out.  For $12 you get a bag of frozen smoked pulled pork that is so easy to fix at home!  Just put it in a pan - I added a little (very little) of my favorite bbq sauce - and heat until hot.  Great smoke flavor, no fatty pieces and very tender.  The pulled pork is as good as any I've had from a bbq place here or anywhere.  I also tried the ham steaks and they were tasty, not fatty and much better than any ham steak I've bought at the grocery store.    I'm a repeat customer and that says it all!

Love the food here!  I think they have the best fried rice ever, and love that the vegetables and meat are large pieces and not chopped into teeny pieces.  I almost always get the Mussaman Curry and it's some of the best I've ever had.  My second favorite is the sizzling beef, although last time I had carry out the meat was tough and way overcooked.  They handle special orders with no problem, although every addition costs $$.  They used to run a spice scale of 1-10 with 5 being comparable to jalapenos, but have since changed it to a 1-5 scale with 3 being the old 5.  My biggest complaint here is that twice now they've reversed the spiciness of the dishes ordered.  Once when I ate in my curry had no spice and my friends had so much spice she couldn't eat it.  Of course they fixed the problem for us right away.  The second time it happened was a carry-out order and it was too much of a hassle to return for the correct items.  Can't see why this should be so difficult to get right.  They have a discount card of sorts, accumulate points based on dollars spent and then earn $10 off a purchase.  I also recently received a 20% email for being in their "loyalty program for a year".    I'll be back soon!

I was torn between giving this 3 and 4 stars - This is a smaller farmers market compared to others in the Phoenix area, but for me, I rather like that. It's convenient and easy for me to get here, and being on a Friday morning it doesn't get the crowds the weekend and evening markets get.  Booths line up on both sides of the sidewalk in front of the Mesa Amphitheater, which makes the walkway rather narrow and with the large number of babies in strollers you're bound to get in the way.  That's the bad part.  I've been here twice now, the first time my biggest motivation was for The Tamale Store after buying some at the Phoenix Public Market.  The best part was buying local veggies and tomatoes that taste like tomatoes should.  The line for the Windmill Farms check out was very long the first time, so the next time I came, I got here early, made that my first stop and was in and out quickly.    Other vendors include Pork On a Fork, Doctor Hummus (must buy the the Sundried Tomato Basil Pesto!), Donna's Bakery, Dry Bay Fish Company, Storino's (love the vanilla fig balsamic), a co selling grass fed beef (forgot which one), the pickle guy with pickled asparagus, and of course a few booths selling salsas and a few with arts and craft stuff.  And you must be sure to see the baby goats!!  They are just so freaking cute :)  I like having this market close by and if I just buy what's on my list, I can be there and back home within an hour.

Best sandwich I have ever had!!    I've been back a few times and always get their signature sandwich, the Bobbie.  Fresh shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, mayo on very fresh tasty bread.  Fantastic!  I've also tried the Italian Grilled Meats and it was delicious, but not quite as good as the Bobbie.  I'd like to try some of their other sandwiches but I just can't not order my favorite.   A small sandwich is enough for a meal, the medium for 2 and large 20" is definitely enough for 3-4 people.  They'll cut the sandwich in 1/2, 1/3's or even 1/4's without any problem.  The service is friendly and fast.  You can see them make your sandwich fresh and they do not skimp on the fillings.    Love this place and glad it's only 10 minutes from home.  Yum!!

Just another Chinese Buffet, with all the same standard items as most.  The reason for 4 stars?  I loved the fried shrimp they had for lunch, the excellent egg foo yung and what seemed like homemade chocolate chip cookies on the dessert bar.  The ceviche on the salad bar was fresh and very tasty, I could have made a meal out of that alone!  Better than 3 stars, maybe not quite a 4, but to offset the other bad reviews I'm bumping them up one star ;)

Went for lunch today with Rand H and Mike C just as they were opening for the very first time.  I am far from being a buffet expert, but this was nothing like the Chinese buffets I had been to back in Chicago.  As Rand said, there were over 130 items, including a Mongolian BBQ, a sushi bar, as well as a good variety of Chinese and American foods.  Everything I tasted was excellent with good flavor and high quality.  There is something for everyone here and at 7.95 for a lunch time buffet, it's definitely a bargain.  I will be back!

I found this place on yelp because I had no interested in paying $125 for a massage!  At $34 for an hour, I thought how could it bad?  Especially with all the 5 star reviews.  I wish I had a 5 star experience.  I came in my by myself and was walked to the back and told to sit in the chair and someone would be right with me.  I waited about 10 minutes before she came in (I wish I remembered her name) and pulled the ottoman from under my feet and came back a few minutes later with the plastic lined tub of hot water.  Ahhhhhhhh I was ready for my massage.  She did massaged my shoulders, my scalp, face, arms etc - but totally ruined the mood when she answered her cell phone, not once but twice during the hour I was there!!  God I hate cell phone abuse especially when I'm paying for a service.    When I turned over and she could do my back, twice she put extreme pressure on my tail bone causing much pain.  You'd think after I jumped and said something the first time, she'd avoid that area?  Her touch elsewhere was quite firm and it wasn't until the next day that I noticed 2 small bruises on the sides of my neck. :(    Maybe I'll be back, but I'll make a request for Rex who seems to have many fans here on yelp.  I love the price and the concept here, just had a bad experience with one of their masseuses.

Had lunch here today with Rand H, Jeromy H, and Norm R.  This is a really nice buffet restaurant with a very large and cheesy fountain when you first walk in.  The tables and booths are comfortable and set apart from the buffet area.    This buffet is huge and has all the usual Chinese buffet items, sushi, and a hibachi grill.  The peel n eat shrimp were very good, not mushy or rubbery like most places and the quality of the food was some of the best I've had for a buffet.  How this place differed than most, they had beef roast that you sliced yourself and other beef, prime rib maybe?, that were both tasty and tender.    The only drawback was most of the staff does not speak English, so don't bother asking what something is if you don't know.  Mike C asked what kind of pie/cake that was on the dessert table and was told "cake". Obviously!  It was very yummy whatever it was!

Not good at all.  This place advertises itself as healthy Mexican food and I've been meaning to stop in for awhile.  They serve at a counter, where you pick your entree.  I decided to go for the 2 taco combo on soft corn tortillas, one with shredded beef and the other steak.  He threw the tortillas on a grill, which I presumed would make them hot, but they were not.  Scooped the beef in sauce out of a bin on one tortilla and pulled steak pieces out of another.  I also had a scoop of Mexican rice and I chose the black beans.  The only thing served hot were the beans.  The next person behind the counter topped the meat with toppings of my choice - pico de gallo, corn, cilantro - and gave me a cup for my drink.  They have a separate area with toppings, corn, salsa, hot sauce, mild sauce, jalapenos and olives.  The salsa tasted like tomato sauce and the hot sauce was barely hot.  I went to my table, picked up the shredded beef taco and the tortilla broke apart in pieces.  They really should double the tortillas for tacos.  The beef was lukewarm, the toppings cold and wasn't very flavorful.  The steak on the other taco was cold, dried out and very tough, I couldn't even pull it apart with my hands.  I took the steak out and just ate the tortilla with the rice, beans, corn and pico de gallo.    They were pretty busy here and maybe I ordered the wrong stuff, but I don't think I'll be back to try something else.  The food just was not good or fresh.  About $8 for the 2 taco combo plus a medium drink.

I'd really give this place 4.5 stars but it's not really a 5 and a little better than a 4.  Today was their grand opening - and by the time it was getting crowded.  The food was very good, your usual chinese buffet foods in addition to sushi/sashimi and a mongolian bbq station.  The clams and the fried crab was a nice addition and they also had a station of American foods.  There was an excellent salad bar with more choices than the average Chinese buffet.  The food was served HOT, was well prepared and the service was excellent.  Since was there first day they didn't have all the food selections when we arrived at 11.  But I noticed they kept adding more things while we were there.  Would have liked to try more of their dim sum items, all I had was the tea leave wrapped sticky rice and it was not my favorite; too sweet and gummy rather than a savory item I am more used to.  9.99 for weekend lunch, 7.39 during the week.

Thanks to Mark R for introducing me to this place or I'd never have found it. On the outside it looks like all the other dumpy run down Mexi places in Mesa, but on the inside they have amazing food!  Not only is the food good the prices are cheap.  I also love that they have a drive thru that is quick.  My favorite thing to order is the #12 daily special, for less than $6 you get 2 fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos with a drink.  The tacos are the small street tacos, but they sure are filling.  I had never had fish tacos until I came here and they are one of my most favorite foods now.  Their steak quesadillas are delicious too.  If you eat/go inside they have a small salsa bar and all of them are tasty with a good amount of heat.    If you're in the area stop in and check it out. Yum!

I was referred here by another landscaping company that didn't service my area (wish I could remember that business name so I could thank them)  I have this huge nasty cactus that has been growing on top of my orange tree, and I'd much rather have an orange tree than this ugly cactus.  I called Dave on Monday, sent him a picture of what I needed done and he quoted me a price over the phone and scheduled me for Thursday and would call me and tell me what time his workers would arrive.  Next day he texted me and said 7am on Thurs.  He called me about 6:30 to tell me his guys were on the way, good thing he did because I almost overslept!  They arrived promptly at 7 and got right to work.  I showed them what I needed done and they did a great job!  They got rid of the offending cactus arms, and even trimmed up my orange tree and removed a nasty weed that was growing right next to it.  They cleaned up all the mess and were gone about 7:45am.  He even gave me some tips in caring for the tree to get bigger and juicier oranges.    I'd definitely call them again!

I've been here twice now for the All you can eat lunch special - only 7.99 for all you can eat salad, cheesesticks (more like a cheese pizza with no sauce), individual pizzas and soda.  What a bargain and the food is delish!  The salads were generous and fresh, must try the housemade vinaigrette.  The cheese sticks were made with asiago cheese and were crispy and as good as any of the pizzas.  But the star of the meal?  The pizzas!  You can order any of their unusual pizzas and they come in a small individual size, cut in 4 pieces for easy sharing.  Some of the my favorites were the fajita chicken pizza with a white sauce on the side that tasted great!  I loved the spinach pizza with fresh tomatoes and I'm a fan of the pollotate pizza with potatoes and olive oil.  It's most fun to come with a group and share and taste them all!  The service is top notch, they were quick to offer more of everything, salad, cheesesticks or pizzas.  Servers were friendly and when one of our group checked in on yelp and there was a 10% off dinner offer, they took $1 off everyone's check!  Doesn't get better than that :)

As far as Asian buffets go, I think this place is as good as it gets.  It's in an old Claim Jumper restaurant and except for the very large buffet stations, they've left pretty much everything as is.  It's comfortable seating and feels most upscale than most other buffet places.  The food is fresher; it's served on platters in smaller batches as opposed to dumping a huge pile of food into a stainless trough.  There is much more variety and the food is better quality!  Some of my favorites, the calamari - lightly breaded in a sweet sauce, the tempura - huge shrimps and veggies fried just right, the dishes with beef had nice cuts of meat, tender and not fatty/gristly, and the snow peas and green beans were slightly crispy and very tasty.  They also have a better than average selection of salads, sushi, fresh fruits and yummy desserts.  The custard was awesome and tasted just like creme brulee.  The service is also 5 stars, they were quick to remove our dirty plates and kept my iced tea and water filled without having to ask.   They also set extra napkins on the table and wet naps, without us having to ask!  As Rand H said, this is the Wandering Horse of Asian Buffets!

3 1/2 stars rounding up to 4 for a better than average selection of Chinese and American foods.  Had lunch here a few weeks ago with our regular lunch bunch, Rand, Mike and Mark.  The best part of this buffet is that it's very busy for lunch so the food gets rotated pretty quickly and isn't sitting in the troughs very long.  Funny that the best thing I ate was labeled House Bread, which were little muffins filled with ham and cheese.  So so good!  The other selections were pretty good, nothing to greasy and plenty of meat and seafood options.  I was really looking forward to their Mongolian BBQ but found too many other things that looked good and I was full.  I really did not like the lighting in this place. They use fluorescent lights and just did nothing for the atmosphere and I found it really made the experience less than what it could be.  It just bugged me, although no one else at our table seemed to care.  I'm sure we'll be back at some point in our lunch/buffet rotation!

A happy taste of Chicago in my mouth!  As far as I'm concerned it's the best Italian Beef sandwich in AZ.  I always get it dipped with hot peppers and I'm a happy girl.  Their combo with beef and sausage is also great.  They serve Chicago hot dogs the way I remember back home.  Even their cheese sauce for the fries tastes like cheese and not the regular canned toxic cheese.  Yes, the place is loud, yes the place gets crowded.  But I don't care - it's a happy reminder of home for me.  Can't wait until they open their Tempe Marketplace location closer to where I live!

Wow! I had been looking forward to trying this place ever since Norm R pointed out their 5 star average and almost 250 reviews! Needless to say my expectations were very high.  Everything looked so good, but I had to try the chicken and waffles with a side of mac n cheese. This isn't just any waffle, it's a thick, fluffy, not too sweet, red velvet waffle. I thought the sweet cream topping might make it to sweet for me, but it was perfect. The waffle is served with fried chicken thighs, cut up and deboned. The chicken was juicy and most important, the skin was crispy and tasty.  The mac n cheese was good, just out of the oven. This is truly a mom and pop place and you know they do all their own, from scratch cooking. The collard greens I tried from Norm's plate were some of the best I've ever had. Full of flavor, smoked turkey and not bitter. The ribs were fall off the bone and really good.   They are closed on Mon and Tues and it's definitely worth the drive!

My phone had a broken charging port and I was afraid I was going to have to get a new phone ... made a call to see if they could help before I drove over. Kyle was helpful and friendly over the phone and assured me he had the part and could fix the phone. I'm paranoid about leaving my phone with strangers, so was happy that he could work on it right there while I watched. Walked right into the store and he had it charging up again like new in less than 1/2 hour.   Fast friendly service at a great price.

I was lucky enough to score tix to their soft opening tonight and I cannot tell you much I have been anticipating this. I've been a Lou's fan since I was a kid eating pizza at their original Lincolnwood, IL location. When it comes to pan pizza, it has to be Lou's buttercrust.  I normally go for cheese only, but opted for the Chicago Classic this time - buttercrust pan pizza with sausage. Just as good as it is in Chicago, maybe even better because I can get it in Phoenix! Had the small Malnati's salad, enough to share for 2 or even 3 or 4, it's huge! They have their own house dressing, on the sweet side and delicious!  I will definitely be back.
