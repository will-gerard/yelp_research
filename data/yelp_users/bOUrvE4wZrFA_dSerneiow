This place is ah-mazing....the ambience is so chic and relaxing and they serve wine! Aside from the atmosphere, the pedicure is perfect-attentive and so relaxing, not rushed, and when I was describing what I wanted in a mani they truly listened and delivered. It's been so hard to find a good nail salon and I will definitely be making this one my regular!

Experience was mostly good, just a couple concerns...however, after reading other negative reviews (not recommended) I'd suggest you really do research before boarding here...Firstly, the price. Seems to be a little high personally, but I'd like to think the facility is exceptional... We left our dogs here for three nights (4 days). I left specific bags of food for each measured for each day and gave the girl instructions on how to feed (nothing complicated), yet we picked them up with leftover bags... I'm choosing to believe the dogs weren't eating as much out of stress, but no one discussed this with me, and even told me that they were eating fine and didn't seem upset or anything when I called to check on them. My older dog even seemed a little traumatized when we picked them up, but I overlook that because he is a timid breed. Also, I'm not sure what the bathroom situation is, (we had them in the large run), but our 6 month old was completely potty trained prior to boarding, but since he's been home he has had accident after accident. This causes me to question the attention given to them. All in all, it is a boarding facility and they have MANY animals to look after, so I wouldn't expect it to be perfect, but a little more communication and attentiveness would have been nice. And I really don't like some of the negatives I've heard from other people.

I really can't understand some of the negative reviews I see here, but I'm convinced that some people will just NEVER be happy, and they probably like it that way...   I ended up reading the negative reviews AFTER my first few visits, when I recommended my boyfriend and his family to Dr. Reed... I was actually appalled that anyone would think the office manager was not a nice woman, because I think she is the sweetest thing... All of the staff are truly enjoyable...   I also saw a review from a user who ended up being referred by another dentist to go to MEXICO for a surgery... I just think NO ONE in their right mind should go to Mexico for medical procedures... Why couldn't your new dentist do it? Dr. Reed has done a wonderful job on my teeth. I originally went to him because he will replace silver amalgam fillings...I had all 5 of mine replaced.   And if there is any question about teeth cleaning, I must say, I thought my boyfriend's teeth were okay, but after he had the "deep cleaning", I was taken aback by how clean they looked-I had obviously never seen his "real" teeth. He hadn't been to a dentist in 10+ years, so plaque had built up. (He had gotten the Groupon, which does state it's restrictions, and doing the deep clean was HIS choice... He will still be able to use the Groupon later.) And personally, when I had my teeth cleaned, previously another dentist had told me what I thought was a cavity was actually a stain and that the hygienist would remove it, but when I mentioned it she couldn't see it and assumed it was gone-but it wasn't. The hygienist at Dr. Reed's office did remove it, thank goodness. My teeth felt VERY clean.   I just really believe that it is not fair to say that they don't know what they are doing, or that the office staff is unpleasant, because I think this place is wonderful!

Had a pretty bad experience at Aria this weekend...the hotel itself is nice and the rooms are decent...not great. Some stains on the white sheets, the "strip view" was of the roof, and the blackout curtains didn't black out much...ended up buying their sleeping mask package to try and get rest during the day, but it was horribly uncomfortable. The shower/tub area was cool, but the floor is extremely slick, and the shower head spray was pretty uncomfortable...Not too much that I would usually complain about, though. The worst of it began when we ordered room service late one night. Had Caesar salad that tasted like it was from a gas station, ridiculously overpriced (like $18?), and a ham sandwich that I could have gotten at Denny's...$25. The total bill was $90...for 2 sandwiches, a soup and a salad...When I called to let them know how bad it was, they did not care...did not offer to take anything off the bill...the following day we went to a $400 dinner for my boyfriends birthday...we brought home leftovers and contacted the front desk to see if they could be saved and reheated later, and they said of course, brought us a mini fridge (since they didn't have one in the room that we could use). We saved our dinner for later, since we knew we'd be hungry and the room service was so terrible. When we called to request it be reheated, they told us they could not accommodate us. We would have eaten it the night before when it was still warm if we'd known, instead we threw away about $150 of food. They ended up giving us a $40 food credit to use at the hotel. On top of this, I had requested some kind of "romance" package for my boyfriends birthday, (flowers, chocolate, whatever.) They told me they could do rose petals, chocolate strawberries and champagne with some balloons. Cost $200 for shit champagne and some rose petals. The strawberries were decent. Overall the experience was very disappointing...I WILL say that we decided to try breakfast the morning we left, since we had the food credit, and it was great-the woman who brought it was extremely pleasant and the food was delicious, although still extremely overpriced. We will not be staying here again.

Looking for a later brunch that still had good menu options, we were nervous about this place because the reviews weren't great, but thank GOD we came here...possibly the best breakfast I've ever had...definitely the best French toast I've ever had...and our server Shelby was absolutely adorable. Her service was above and beyond, and she was the sweetest! So personable and on top of EVERYTHING. We didn't need to ask for a thing, she thought of it all! Especially with the bad service we've received elsewhere in Vegas, (which does not discount her in the least, she's amazing regardless, anywhere I've ever been), she was a breath of fresh air. I can't say enough good about her, but I needed to say something because she deserves recognition! :)

The food is great...the service sucks. Takes ages for them to get the check, run the card, they forget to bring what you asked for, I swear they remembered us and were purposely rude...the hostess was talking to another waiter about our table, peeking over his shoulder, along with flirting with the other waiters all night, distracting them. If you can sit for three hours it's great.

My family and I came into The Arrogant Butcher for my mother's birthday...needless to say we were all very disappointed with the whole experience. We were hoping to be in and out easily with a great lunch, as we've eaten at Culinary Dropout and it has always been good, and we've been here for dinner in the past...we waited thirty minutes for a waiter to order our food, and we'd hoped that even though we had to wait for that it would be downhill from there...unfortunately, it took an entire hour to get our meals, which consisted of simple sandwiches and salads...when the salads did come they didn't even have the right dressing. The drinks were empty most of the time as well. The manager was quite rude when we asked for her, and the waiter never did apologize...the manager also was quick to blame the waiter for the error, which seemed very unprofessional in my opinion. In addition, the cost of the food seemed to FAR exceed the quality...the fact that you can get artisan bread for the cheeses but then a BLT comes on a bun seems a bit silly. Overall, the experience was very lax and not very enjoyable.

I've been to so many nail salons throughout Scottsdale and Phoenix and not once have I found one that I am completely satisfied with until now. I've never been the type to have a go-to "nail lady", but now I do! The first time I came I had been to another salon that was recommended to me, and I had some broken nails at the time and wanted simple acrylic tips glued on with gel polish. The guy told me that wasn't possible and I asked him to just make them as natural looking as he could....he put so much gunk heaped up on my nails I could hardly feel my fingers as they were so heavy...they looked horrible. Coming to Lavish it took her nearly 45 mins just to get them off and it was PAINFUL. I had almost no nail left...but I explained to her what I examined to him and she said OF COURSE. She did them so beautifully! I even tried to go to another salon after with a friend (that she went to) and I won't do that again...this place rocks. And they are so sweet!

I'm always in a rush, but I love a great breakfast, so this place is perfect in my mind... The food is very good and it's fast, plus it's all local, so it's super fresh! They are very attentive to your opinion, so when they come around and ask how something is, don't be afraid to tell them if you don't enjoy it.

This place is amazing...the staff is FANTASTIC! Super friendly and enthusiastic, and they clearly love their jobs! We felt immediately like "one of the family". The office is beautiful and clean, along with state of the art equipment...I think our dogs actually really enjoyed being there (I know they loved the employees!) They take extra measures to make sure your experience is exceptional, things I've never seen in another vets office! (Offering coffee and a tour of the whole facility!) I am wary of vets, having had several bad experiences (some including misdiagnoses, even having to put an animal down), but Dr. Casuccio really, truly knows what he is doing and loves the animals...I would trust him with my pets from now on and I hope he will be practicing in the area for a long time!

I moved in a few weeks ago...and so far I love it here. I looked at this place originally because it had a dog park (large and well taken care of) and is extremely pet friendly, but in reality it is so much more than that. The pool is awesome and the people are all super friendly. Although I was originally promised a different type of unit by someone who was no longer working in the leasing office by the time I moved in, unforeseen circumstances didn't allow it, and Kristi did everything she could to make sure we found a unit I thought would work for me. Although the place has some "young people with money", there are also older people here that seem to really like it. I also think there are plenty of these "young" people, myself included, that DON'T stay up late partying, and although some people may be a little loud on weekends (naturally), I personally have asked my neighbors nicely to quiet down, and they did. It is still an apartment and it is certainly a young person's type of place, but that isn't something that is kept secret from the get go. Also, I'm not sure what having a white parking garage has to do with not crashing into walls, but I will admit some people do fly through. I think that has more to do with the "old, successful, rolling in a Bentley" type drivers who think they run the road....(just kidding). If you just take your time and pay attention, as a proper driver should, the parking garage is not a problem. Bottom line, I think anywhere you go, people will be human, and no place is perfect, but these guys are doing their best. Christian is a total sweetheart, and the rest of the staff have been very helpful. You just have to communicate with them. This is all coming from someone who had to break a lease at another "luxury" community because it truly WAS a horrible experience, so I am no stranger to these frustrations! You can't please everyone, but it's worth it to look at this place.

I used to see this place on Instagram and I was SO happy when they opened one here. It does not disappoint. Place is so delicious, and I love all the natural choices.
