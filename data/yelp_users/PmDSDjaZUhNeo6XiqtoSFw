Love this place. I eat the cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches and pizza when I go. I have enjoyed every meal, every time, always fresh ingredients prepared well. The staff is very friendly and I really like the ambiance, the prices are fair as well. I wish it were closer, it's an hour and a half drive round trip each time we go, but well worth  the trip. I have taken many friends and business associates to Uncle Sam's and will continue to in the future. I highly recommend you check this place out.  Ps. I left my sunglasses there a few weeks ago on a Saturday. They used my credit card receipt to get my name and labeled them with my name. I called the next day, to confirm they had them, 2 weeks later, when I finally went by, they had them waiting for me.... Really cool!

One of the bottom 3 restaurants in my entire life. 1) The place is filthy. Floor had food on it, table was sticky. 2) The girl at the counter was rude. 3) I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It had no pepper and no peanuts and was EXACTLY the same plate as my friend that ordered Teriyaki chicken. It was neither Kung Pao OR Teriyaki. 4) We asked what was up with the order, they said they were out of peanuts, peppers and teriyaki sauce. 5) We asked for our money back and they refused to refund money even though we did not get what we ordered and did not eat what they gave us. 6) I happened to notice that you also have to pay full price for refills, even tea.  This was over a year ago, but I forgot to rate it then.... Horrible horrible establishment. If you want dirty rude atmosphere with low end food that you did not order, go here for sure.

Just picked up lunch for the wife while she is having Chemo done at MD Anderson......  Tater tots are very cold and very old. Shake didn't taste right. Diet Coke was flat. My burger wasn't fully cooked, 3/4 pink.  The corn dogs were acceptable and the manager was friendly and apologetic and credited my card for the rest of the purchase when I called in, so not the end of the world, could have been worse...  But now I have to go back out in the heat somewhere else and get her lunch again.....  I most likely will not return here.  Sonics seem to be sucking every single time I go there anymore....  I think I'm probably done with the chain at this point.  :( I used to love Sonic, hate to see it sliding this way....

I've been going here since the mid 90's or earlier.  Great food, decent prices always friendly employees and the place is nearly always pretty busy. I drive a long way round trip on the weekends to go here, hour total? It's worth it. I typically get the island hot wings with rice and potato mac.  My wife loves their rice, I do too, it's rare to find consistently good rice, but theirs is on point every time. Everything I had from here has always been good and filling. Got a Polynesian hankering? Get it fixed here!!! You won't be disappointed.

Love this place, it's really good Italian at a great price. I've had nearly everything on the menu and it has all been great every time. My regular meals are the Lasagna with spicy Italian sausage, garlic bread with cheese, pepperoni pizza rolls (muffins)?, their pizza is also among the best. Super tasty, I've turned probably 20 people onto this place over the years, ALL are now regular customers. We drive a pretty long way round trip to go here on the weekends when we go..... Luckily the place is "kind of" on the way home from work, so about once a month, I'll stop by and pick it up for a dinner treat for the wife and I. The place is always clean including the restrooms, (one of my pet peeves). Like Italian? You'll love this place!!!

I have loved donating at United Blood services and planned to do so every quarter for the rest of my life until I met the disrespectful jerk employee here that raised his voice to me repeatedly "Let me finish!!!", I couldn't carry a conversation or get a word in edge wise with this bully idiot.  I had the displeasure of meeting that abrasive employee at this location, AND I WILL NEVER AGAIN DONATE TO UNITED BLOOD SERVICES BECAUSE OF IT.  I am still stunned by this male phlebotomists/nurse whatever he was, his demeanor and attitude, seemed to be that of a low life ghetto thug.  United, you should look into this guy, he will repel more donors if you do not remove him from donor contact.  Side note: Your bait and switch tactics really bothered me, I was donating anyway, so I wasn't really expecting to get things, but don't send out emails telling people that they'll get a $10 Amazon gift card and then tell them they can't have one when they get there, this will also repel donors.  I hope this is location specific as the lack of professionalism was appalling.  Shame, it was a good and generous commitment on my part that helped the community. Now every time I hear that blood supplies are low, I will know why.

Worst McDonalds experience ever. Rude ignorant jerk behind the counter, the General Manager standing right next to him, GM said nothing, did nothing about the rotten employee. No greeting, just a dead rude stare, I asked for a meal, he said in a low negative antagonistic tone, "What about it?!?", like he was picking a fight. I realize minimum wage gets minimum effort employees, but wow McDonalds!!!! I will never go to this location EVER again. Oh yeah, twice previously got tea that tasted like chemicals, like it was dish water, seriously and on 2 different occasions.

SCAM ALERT!!!! One of the vulcher companies that called me after I bought a new house, ON MY CELL PHONE!!! They are one of the companies from that scam package for new home buyers that was dropped off at my new house.  I'm on the national do not call list, and I will be reporting your company.  DO NOT BOTHER ME ANYMORE!!!  This is the funny part...... The people I bought my house from had a Pristine system that they SAID they paid $6,500 for the Water Softener and R.O.. I priced the same exact items with another contractor, $1,800 for both installed..... They took both with them when they moved....  LOL, $6,500 for $1,800 worth of stuff. Very credible!!! LOL.....  Run away!!!!  Scammers!!!!

I'm a two time war vet with plenty of military range time and tens of thousands of rounds down range, as well as dozens of firearm handling and tactical courses. Im very well trained and ultra safe, never a accidental discharge and love to teach people about firearm safety.... That being said, there is no pleasing the jerks that run this range...  Nazi douche bags run this place. They talk to people as if they think they are gods. I can't imagine a worse staff in any environment, I'm sure there is a special place in hell for these arrogant condescending jerks. Needless to say, one star is too many.  I got chastised for grabbing a target off of the top of my table as I walked out to set targets, ABSOLUTELY NO SAFETY ISSUE, however, some idiot fired his cannon 10 seconds after cease fire, hardly a word was said to him. So in my assessment, it's not about safety, it's about them being positional authority, get a life losers.  They scream and yell at people and have absolutely no respect for people. The range retards suck all of the fun out of shooting, in the 2 hours that we were there, 8 people left early and in disgust of the staff, that's just on the west end of the shooting stalls....  Idiots run this place, I will never return.  They are surely compensating for shortfalls in their personal lives.

Amazing steaks served extra hot on a sizzling plate. Sides and appetizers are decadent and everything is chock full of great flavor. The Cowboy Cut steak is enormous and simply the best steak I have ever had (several times now). This place is where I splurge for celebrations, it's not cheap, but quality never is. Our waitress the last 2 trips was incredibly intuitive in filling our needs. If given the opportunity, this is my last meal...

First visit today, it's 50 minutes from home but we were in the area and went on a recommendation, so glad we stopped.  Absolutely phenomenal pulled pork sandwich, best I have ever had to date, bar none. Really good baked potato, excellent service, great ambiance, free corn bread that was also pretty good. At the end of the meal the waitress brought us a little bag of tiny cinnamon donuts that were made just seconds before she brought them to us, scrumptious.  I was also given a sample of the brisket, it was really good too.  Look out Joes BBQ!!! (And I love Joe's) When Bobby Q's opens this fall at Stapley and I-60 you are gonna take a hit.  Given the opportunity, we will revisit Bobby Q's when We're on that side of town.  (Kudos to our very pregnant and excellent waitress today, 15% tip to her and 15% tip to the baby. My wife just had her first Chemo treatment for breast cancer and is rapidly losing her hair, the great food and service really cheered her up today and she really needed that. Thank you!!!)

It was OK.... I got a pulled pork sandwich with one side, the SW mac & Cheese.... I paid a $3 upcharge for more meat... and got a drink, they have the digital soda machine with the flavorings, pretty nice.  Not so impressed to be honest... The pulled pork was both very tough and very very fatty, the bread was stale (tasted a week old, I looked for mold it was so bad) and the SW mac & cheese was not for me, tasted like an experiment a kid made with mac & cheese and some salsa... but hey, the soda was good.  I was really surprised when the total was just short of $17.50, with a tip, I'm out $20.... FOR LUNCH..... for a mediocre lunch at that.....  I won't be going back unless I'm a guest at someone else's expense. If the total were $10 out the door, I would have possibly given this place a second chance as every single meal can't be perfect. But certainly, no second tries at $20.  Honestly, McDonald's quarter pounder with cheese is much more appetizing...

Got my first Tattoo yesterday here with Michael. Awesome guy, excellent work, took my sketch and he improved on it, added some details I hadn't pondered. The needle work was excellent, no blood, minimal pain, at one day it looks even better than I had hoped. I am a pretty big guy and have 21" arms, he knocked out an upper arm piece in about 3 hours, I had been told at other shops it would take at least 5 hours. I will be going back for the other arm when I can decide on all of the details for that tat. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some quality work, Tattoos are not an item that you price shop for!!!! Quality is what matters, you own it for life, Michael will give you a quality tattoo....

Got a really good pizza here!!!! Beware when picking up, I was not greeted for several minutes when I arrived and the pizza was 15 minutes later than I was told, so I had to wait. They were very busy, probably could have used 1 more employee. Awesome pizza though, just plan on 30 minutes not 15 and you'll be happy as can be.

I've been visiting Dr Summers for many years now, she is a great chiropractor with a great business. I think I have referred 15 people here so far, all very happy and repeat customers. Prior to getting adjusted you get electronic muscle stimulation and a nice heat pad on your back, it really loosens up the muscles and feels great. Then you get a quick massage by a professional massage therapist to knock out any knots and prepare you for your adjustment. Adjustment time!! Back, hips, neck, ahhhh, relief... It always feels amazing to walk out after you get your back neck and hips back in alignment after having been out.... Best chiropractor I have ever visited, she really does a great job. She also always has a great staff. Feeling a little twisted up? Go see Dr. Patty, she'll get you straightened out! Thanks for doing such a great job Dr. Patty!!!

Typical Discount Tire, everybody is hustling and working hard, tires are a decent deal with the rotations and warranties. I have bought several sets of tires here, but on my last purchase they put a 3 to 4" long and pretty deep scratch on all 4 of my factory Tacoma rims, right where they removed the weights. I showed the managers twice asking for them to have the paint repaired and they refused to do anything for me at all. The marks were blatantly theirs as the grudge from the previous weights were centered at each scratch, both managers even acknowledged that they did it. One even made the statement, " What are we supposed to do? There is nothing that can be done for this." I told him that they needed to be refinished, his response? "Never gonna happen". So, yes we acknowledge that we damaged the rims, and no we aren't going to do anything to make it right. This was back in 2007, I haven't returned since. The scratches looked so bad I ended up buying another set of factory wheels that matched them, DISCOUNT TIRE WOULDN'T EVEN DO THE SWAP FOR ME!!!!! So I paid to have it done elsewhere, total cost was about a $300 hit all in and several hours of my time. I believe I have bought 7 or 8 sets of tires with Discount over the years for myself and probably 70 sets as a Fleet/Procurement Manager (at a different Discount Tire location). I have bought another 7 sets of tires since then at other places between my SUV, my project cars and my wife's car, and 3 sets of wheels, business they have lost along with countless tires at work since then (maybe 600 tires?) I even informed the other Discount Tire as to why they had lost my work business, more short sightedness, they also did nothing to help me, lol.... I plan to not do business with any Discount Tire ever again if I can avoid it, due to this installer's error but mainly the management's bad judgement and their callus attitudes. I wish I had pictures of the wheels and scratches to post here, they were pretty bad, all the way to the metal, not sure what the tire jockey was thinking as he damaged them. Oh well, life gives you lessons sometimes, sometimes the lessons cost you money, sometimes they end up rewarding the mom & pop shops with my tire business :) I would not recommend this place, but I'm sure that they have changed managers between now and back then, 9 years ago. My advice, take before pictures of your rims with a time and date stamp prior to ANY shop changing tires for you, could possibly save you money and head aches, if and when they are damaged. The same thing happened at Big O Tire since then, at least Big O accepted fault and stepped up and repaired the rims..... Side note, I have never bought a warranty on any tire since I bought tires at Discount and have never needed one. Food for thought, save your cash if you are OK with doing your own rotations and paying for a balance once before the tires wear out. At least I don't damage my own stuff. You might not have the bad deal that I got here, either way, Good luck!!!!!

I've eaten here a dozen times, clean place, great food. I like to visit when the weather is right to sit outside as the seating area inside is limited and a bit of an echo chamber. Never had a bad meal here. Give it a try....

I've been here twice, first time was last week with a coworker. I was happy to see a well displayed $6 lunch for 2 slices and a drink...Pizza was OK, edible, not great but different, I like things mixed up a little, so different is good for me. When my coworker sat down, she was surprised by the bill, (it was her turn to buy) because we had both bought the $6 lunch deal and we shared some zuccini sticks, but the bill was nearly $25. The zucchini was NOT $12, so what was the problem? The girl behind the counter said we had gotten a couple of premium slices, so OK. Well today I was in the area and it sounded good, so I dropped in. I asked the girl behind the counter which slices of the several types of pizza displayed were included in the $6 lunch deal for 2 slices and a drink. She said just pick a couple and we discount it. So I picked a couple, jalapeño and pepperoni and the other was ham and pineapple..... Good to go right? Nope.... Nearly $9 at the register.... I asked what was up and she said they discounted the items I selected.... Bottom line, they could not show me any pizza that qualifies for the $6 lunch, so essentially THERE IS NO $6 LUNCH DEAL AT THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I grabbed my credit card and left, ended up eating at the restaurant next door. The employees are totally in the know on this scam, there was no question about it. I DETEST DISHONESTY AND WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT... Now you know, they are dishonest and the pizza is nothing special..... I don't like giving such a negative review, but dishonest bait and switch scams infuriate me, it's thievery. According to my coworker, the place just changed ownership, and the owners and staff were much better before....... Shame, could have been my $6 "go to"lunch....

THIS PHARMACY SUCKS!!!!!!! I bet I have to visit this place on average 3 to 4 times each time I try to get a prescription. Again today, they called me, told me my prescription was ready and again I get there and it is not!!!! I even spoke to someone on the phone that told me that it was ready, this was not the auto caller. I have driven off from there empty handed at least 15 times. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE Is there a better alternative around here any where? I'm just stunned at the horrible service over and over again.

UPDATE: PRICE GOUGERS $90 for a prescription that everyone else sells for $7 to $10. SCREW THIS PLACE.  THIS PHARMACY SUCKS!!!!!!!

Again today, they called me, told me my prescription was ready and again I get there and it is not!!!! I even spoke to someone that told me that it was ready, this was not the auto caller. I have driven off from there empty handed at least 15 times. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE Is there a better alternative around here any where? I'm just stunned at the horrible service.

I personally installed some new struts on my wife's HHR and needed to get it aligned afterwards. I looked online and found a coupon for $59 alignment and oil change. They deducted $15 for the oil change since it was just done. $45 alignment, good clean work, no upsell on garbage that I didn't need. Pretty happy all in all. Nice guys, quick turn around.  UPDATE: I brought my FJ in this last week 2/12/13, I had personally installed some new front struts on it as well, same deal, they aligned it, did a great job, no upsell garbage. It runs straight, no greasey hand prints on anything and I couldn't be happier. Great place to go.

Its now 830 pm, I ordered at 700 pm, I'm still hungry and now grumpy and its now too late to eat......  I initially ordered extra sauce, first one came out without extra sauce, like it has been on half a dozen times in the past..... I am just to the point that I will not eat what I didn't order one more time from this place, I've just had it, enough is enough.....  Second delivery, the replacement for their screw up, I open the door to an obviously disgruntled delivery guy even though I had an additional $5 tip for him, yep I'm now at $10 in tips for a $6.99 pizza... The driver says  "That will be $14.88" !!!!!!!!  Yep sent me a replacement for their screwup on my $6.99 pizza and they want to charge me an additional $14.88, don't forget the $5 tip.....  I refused to pay for the pizza so he took it with him........  I called and the manager, he was very professional, nice guy and was gracious enough to credit my card for the initial order........ But still, I'm starving, have nothing to eat and it's too late to eat anyway...... ruined a good evening, I really was looking forward to the pizza tonight, now I'm going to bed hungry.     ¦(  Sucks........  1 year detention for them, if I ever return. Even though they are super quick to credit and or send out a replacement, the consistent disappointment isn't worth the risk or frustration.......

LOL, my wife ordered pizza from this place before I got home, they screwed THAT order up too. She and I get very different pizzas and mine always has the extra sauce, of course they put the extra sauce on her pizza, so she couldn't eat it because the extra sauce makes the pizza too spicy for her, and mine of course is too dry for me. Wasted money on more WRONG pizzas......  I've said it a million times, the wife will never listen to me no matter how much money it costs me.... I ate Ramen Noodles and Tuna instead. WORST PIZZA HUT EVER, wrong pizza 4 out of 5 times. Totino's is better, at least you know for sure what you are getting and paying for.

I always enjoy visiting at this Theater, it is always clean, neat and well maintained. Picture quality and sound are very good, but on a few occasions, the previews had no sound, that kind of sucks hence 4 stars and not 5. Typical way overpriced snack bar with no healthy choices, but of course this is the industry standard, however the snack bar is very clean and well maintained and I don't fear eating anything here. I go to this Harkins over the SanTan location on Greenfield primarily because it isn't near as busy. One time, went to San Tan and couldn't get a ticket, sold out, drove over to Crossroads and got in for the same viewing time at only 40% occupancy. This is my theater of choice. A few more visits with no sound issues and I will change to 5 stars..... Well, many movies later, this place is 5 stars all the way... My one bid complaint though is women that bring in strollers and allow their baby to cry through the entire movie. It ruins the experience, but at least the theater gives a free movie pass each time to make up for it. Can't blame the theater for inconsiderate idiots.....

I got what was expected.  They advertise low cost items and for the money that you pay you get decent food. I got a large 3 topping pizza and wings for $16. I'll get 3 meals out of it, so it's a decent deal. The food is not bad, it's not Rosati's, but I didn't pay $30 for the same size pizza either... I gave 4 stars because I order extra sauce and certainly did not get extra sauce, that happens everywhere though. It seems I am doomed to 2 things when eating out: raw hamburgers and no extra sauce on pizzas, lol. I will go here again, hopefully get my sauce next time. :) Give Geno's a try, you might like.

This was my 3rd visit, so I can give a really fair review.... The atmosphere is a 3 star at best, much too LOUD for sure. My first couple of visits were a 2 and a 4, so still a 3 average for my previous visits.. But, today.... Wow..... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE SPICY FOOD. I eat Thai, Mexican and Eastern Indian all the time. So that being said.... Today was the first time I have ever NOT eaten a piece of meat due to it being overly ridiculously spicy hot. I ordered the spicy pineapple teriyaki burger, it was basically not even edible, but I trudged through half of it hoping it would get better, it did not. My bro got the habanero burger and had had it many times previously and also likes super spicy, his too was over the top hot. The waitress forgot beverages, ketchup, salad dressing, didn't refill drinks in a timely manner. I'm not hating, just being truthful, I want to like the place.... When we mentioned that my burger was not edible, no response (or discount), just took my plate and left with the other half that I didn't eat.... I won't return here, but I can see where some of the food is good and if you are into a dark divey bar for a drink and a game, give it a try. I'm more of a foody and when I go out I want something tasty and filling.....

the food is great, floors are disgusting but everything else is decently clean.  why does it take 15 to 20 minutes to get seated?!?!?!? Let people seat themselves, there are 20 empty tables.  it's a freaking buffet, your seating procedure is absolutely stupid!!!!!  today is the 4th and most likely the last time i walk out the door due to the wait time to get a seat.

Usually $25 to $30 each with tip and one adult beverage each. This is upper end for us, but, you usually get a second meal each with left overs, so really half that price? Golden Wings, Pasta, Pizza, Pizzookie all are awesome! This place is packed all the time because it is so good, I always walk in the back door and just sit at the bar, much easier and much quicker. The bar gals are awesome, one even looks just like the girl from Smallville, (no perving! She's nice and a great waitress/bar tender). They have the Chick-Fil-A/In-N-Out Burger style service and greetings, I love that!! Although it is loud, it is still very comfortable, great crowd too, haven't yet ran into a jerk in this place, that's really cool. Parking is tough, its available but be prepared to walk a couple hundred yards.  Gotta try the Golden Wings, amazing!! Oh yeh, all the girls that work there are hot! Enjoy! I always do!

First visit was pretty good.  *Update - my last 30 visits have been great!!!  Once you get past the look of the parking lot, it's all good.  *Update - new parking lot looks great!!  I got the $10.99 lunch special, pulled pork with a bun, side of mac & cheese and a drink.  Not a bad deal and was filling!! Nice people, basic laid back atmosphere, but clean.  The bun was fresh, the pork tasted great and was cooked and was not fatty, mac & cheese was pretty good, came lots of black pepper in it :), soda was mixed well and tasted good, clean soda machine and amenities table.  I normally would never do a comparison, but since my disappointment at the nearest BBQ shop...............  Texas BBQ House is very good food at a fair price --VS-- The Barbecue Company (a mile away), is grossly overpriced and the food was not so good. (see my review).. I had the same basic meal at each location, the quality definitely goes to the Texas BBQ House, and at 2/3 of the price.........  This is my new go to lunch at my new job. Feeling blessed to have a great place so close...  Give this place a try for sure if you like good BBQ. The guys at the next table were going crazy over the brisket and sausage....

Finally a Doctor that really knows his stuff and has a great staff. I have wasted thousands on other clinics with no results at all. Just started a few weeks ago and already feel better and all of my issues are heading in the right direction. I have body chemistry issues that are literally out of my control, Dr. McWilliams is the first to tell me that and fully explained why and how it all works. Being in my mid 40s I just couldn't understand how a balanced diet and working out was panning no results for me, he explained it and set me on a course of repair. Already solved my energy and strength issues and had a 12.4 pound weight loss the first week with very little effort. Be ready for an education, he spends quality time and fills you in on everything. I will continue to go here, excited to see the results  a year from now.

Arizona Federal is a pretty good bank, don't listen to people that are nearly illiterate and can't spell believe or use the proper conjugation of "you are". These are things most people learn by the 5th grade, probably should take your banking advice from others. :)  "BELIEVE" me "YOU'RE" a valued customer at the Arizona Federal Credit Union.  Great people and services.

I've been a member for over a year now. Love this place. Great coaches, great people. It's in the Springs Church, so the atmosphere is low key , no guys taking off their "blouses", nobody Is cursing, screaming or yelling and no creeps or jerks. We are a family and watch out for each other, probably the most female friendly gym I have ever been to.  Best part about CrossFit is that it is scaled so EVERYBODY can do it, and I mean everyone from kids to seniors. I have really seen some serious life changes in here, I believe people do so well here because of the super supportive atmosphere, everybody cheers everyone on. People here really do want to see you accel and will help you reach your goals in many ways. Workouts are fast and usually pretty short rarely over 20 minutes in an hour class, the rest is warm up, stretching, skill learning, instruction and safety... CrossFit curious? Come check it out, challenge yourself, first workout is always free. Some of the lowest CrossFit rates around. Military and other discount rates too.

The service was great, food was amazing, I got the Perch Burger (huge, took half home) wife got a strawberry salad, I also got some kind of raspberry beer, pretty tasty. We own some parrots so we enjoyed seeing all of the birds, Scarlet Macaw, Blue & Gold Macaw, Cockatoo, Sun Conure and a ton of all types of Amazons, double yellow heads, single yellow head, blue Napes, etc, etc..... Pretty cool place, will return periodically, as it was $50 for what we had it won't be very often, that's upper end for us (besides Ruth's Chris) The patio was OK, they could use a professional architect to come in and make the atmosphere more appealing, but it was OK. The restrooms are interesting, access from the outside, they look like outhouses, but when you walk in they are plumbed and air conditioned, but could use a thorough cleaning, smelled a little.... Those were the only reasons they didn't get 5 stars..... Definitely worth a visit, go check it out.

Best brisket I have ever had by a LONG SHOT. Ribs were amazing.  Gonna return when I have the time. Place forms a line 45 minutes before opening time for a reason. Pretty basic inside and very small seating, but it works. BEST BRISKET ON THE PLANET!!!

Nice little place for some really good Thrifty Ice Cream. Randy is a super nice guy, he sat down and chatted with us for a while as we enjoyed our ice cream. The portions were very generous and the prices were definitely reasonable, there's nothing worse than getting a scoop of ice cream some where just to find out its $9. Not here..... I will be returning for the Home-Made Chili and some Hot Dogs and Burgers. Pretty cool little candy store within the restaurant as well....

The place is clean and the lady is very nice..... That's where the positives end....  I had the half rack of ribs, with coleslaw and potato salad.  This is not BBQ, just meat cooked and drowned in sauce, no BBQ grill or smoking involved..... I'm a bit of a rib snob, these were not good at all.......  At over $18 for the lunch, I expected really good and got well below average.  The flavor was not good, the Ribs were very fatty, but a fair portion of them...rated at 1 out of 5 stars. The potato salad was more mashed potato than salad, I give it a 2 out of 5. The coleslaw was ok, probably the best part of the meal, maybe a 3 out of 5.  The plasticware utensils were really cheap, disposable plate, no salt & pepper shakers on the table except the tiny packets (one each) in the baggy with the plasticware. If you are going to charge over $18 for a lunch..... FOR A LUNCH!!!!! .... at very least serve the lunch on a plate with silverware and have salt and pepper shakers on the table and have some better quality napkins for the "BBQ" sauce, I had to use 10 of the tiny cheapos......  I really hate wasting good money & time on a meal out and getting bland and subpar quality food.....    I seem to be on a run of bad lunches lately...... maybe time to start packing lunch for a while....  Yeah, I would not recommend this place for the "BBQ" or potato ..... whatever it was, salad/mash. Peppersauce Café is right across the street, has amazing service and food and for less money. I don't see this place staying in business long...

Excellent contractor!!!  We have had them install a sink in the garage and a couple of water softeners and reverse osmosis systems as well as miscellaneous repairs and even got some good advise from them.  Very clean work with no scarring or marks on the finishes, they cleaned up after themselves very well and everything worked as it should every time. I highly recommend them for all of your plumbing and heating/AC needs.  Also, the manager and owner are both stand up guys and great honest people. I've had the bottom feeders and quick buck guys at my house in the past that seem to always give a laundry list of things that they feel need repaired or replaced while they are there. It's a relief to know I can call someone that really knows what they are doing when it comes to plumbing and heating/AC and not get ripped off for shoddy work. Need AC or plumbing work done right at a fair price at the house or office? Give these guys a try, you won't be disappointed. Wish I could give another star.....

I went here based on the Yelp reviews....... I'm guessing I just got a bad meal, probably the exception, but this was case.....  I waited for 35 to 40 minutes on my food, that was tough for me, I work a lot of hours and every minute waiting at lunch is that much later I leave for home at night. Also, while waiting in the lobby, there were children there which is no big deal except that one of them in particular kept yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs in an echo chamber of a room, that alone will usually mean that I won't return.  So, I got a jumbo potato with pulled pork. When I got it, it had a bit of a funny smell, but being a new place and a lot of items were on it, I thought nothing of it. Ate half of it for lunch, it was OK, not great, not bad.....But, I felt ill about an hour later and ended up pretty sick the rest of the evening. (out both ends, I know TMI)  The next day when I got to work I pulled the other half out of the fridge, opened the box and a RANCID stench came running out at full speed smacking me right in both nostrils... Nearly made me throw up again for the 6th or 7th time. I believe the pork was not just bad, but rotten. So, so nasty the next day.... good food will not smell rancid 24 hours later in the refrigerator.....  Miss D was a very nice lady and I do wish her the best, but there are times when I cannot give a place a second try, this is one of those times.  Based on the other reviews, you might want to try it out, I hope you have better luck than I did....

I've always had pretty good luck with the Pizza and wings here. Never an issue with undercooked food or being shorted wings, flavor and quality have been consistently good. Why 4 stars? Prices are pretty high, so I rarely go. A couple dozen wings and a Pizza and you're somewhere between $35 and $40, a little extreme, but decent food, so what is your price point? Service has always been good too, nice employees. Give it a try, you'll like.....

DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY FOR PAVERS!!!!!!  I hired "Unto Him" to install some pavers. Incompetent. Unlicensed. NOT Christian. Matt does NOT self perform, he hires a subcontractor that can't comprehend setting grade or matching the adjacent existing paver configuration. By the way, you can see the 5 star review he made of himself, Matt Collins. I assure you, none of the jobs on those photos are his, they are not capable, Google the pics you will see the truth.... other people's projects....  He is NOT a licensed contractor with the registrar of contractors!!!! I asked him twice if he was licensed, bonded and insured, both times said yes. Now that he has quit the project because his unlicensed illegal alien paver installer can't figure out how to set grade, he is claiming that he meant that he has a business license and does not need a contractors license. I have bad news for him, he hired a specialty contractor, (that is not his employee), scheduled work and also bought the materials for the project.  Per the Arizona Registrar of Contractors: Who must be licensed as a contractor? "Contractor" includes..... Hiring and firing of specialty contractors, scheduling of work on the project, and selection and purchasing of construction material......  That aside, the facing of the pavers at the road do not match the adjacent driveway. But most important, the pavers are not set to grade, which ruins the project. Also, the path kind of rolls up and down, many of the stones are loose. The high side of the project is nearly 2 inches higher than the adjacent landscaping that is supposed to be up hill from the pavers, this would cause my property to retain water.  When discussing the problems and after explaining basic grade and elevation to him, he raised his voice "DON'T BE A SMART ASS!!". Yes, he tries to be a bully and a tough guy, that's what big guys with low I.Q.s do. Way out of line, especially for someone that is supposed to be a Christian. I can't imagine speaking to a customer like that, especially one that I just screwed up his yard....  His paver guy wasn't up to the challenge to remove the errantly installed pavers and reinstall them properly, so they quit. I am now bringing on the self performing, licensed, bonded and insured guy that I should have started with......  Contemplating contacting the Registrar of Contractors to inform them that "Unto Him" is performing licensed contracting work without a contractors license. I am also contemplating a lawsuit for financial damages, the lawyer will get more than me, but who cares, whatever I may get would be better than the spit that I have now.....  He may be great a pulling weeds and mowing grass, but I'll never know. I do know this, DO NOT HIRE HIM FOR PAVER WORK!!!!!!!  BUYER BEWARE, cheaper is not better. Yelp first, then check with the Registrar of Contractors. Had I done both, I would have avoided this whole scene.....

UPDATE: I had a professional out, turns out the pavers are the wrong size, wrong color (will never fade to match) and have a different finish at the top. Also they did not install sand after the pavers went in so when you walk on them they move around, it all must be removed and hauled off at $325, not the $150 as originally posted....... And now I pay for materials and install twice. :(

The shelves are medium quality, not complete cheapos and not nearly as good as my last ones, but for $300 for a 4' x 10' shelf installed, not too bad at all.  Jack was pretty angry at me when he called me because he emailed me (rather than calling me) and I didn't call him back immediately. I typically only check personal email once or twice during a work day. If you want an immediate exchange, a call would be in order. He was grumpy and rude with my wife before I got home and also to another subcontractor that was there working on the house.... I had just had my epoxy garage flooring put in, It was cured enough for foot traffic but not vehicle traffic, I explained this to him prior to his arrival, I even asked him if he could protect the floor so the racking wouldn't scar the not yet hardened acrylic coating, he said he would use a rubber mat, he did not. After he left I noticed vehicle tracks from spinning tires on my new epoxy garage floor, I called and asked if he has driven on the floor and he denied it. He was the only contractor that had access within that time frame. My neighbor has a surveillance camera, so I asked if he could roll tape for me and he did. Jack had backed into my garage upon his arrival to unload the racking even though when I called him and asked him about it, he denied having driven in the garage. My epoxy floor now needs to be refinished. I just paid $850 a few days ago to have the floor done, probably going to cost me another $200 or $300 to have it fixed......  Why did he lie about driving on the garage floor?  Why did he not protect my flooring with a rubber mat like he promised?  Why is the racking hanging OVER TOP of my water heater and not centered between the water heater and the kitchen door like I specifically asked?  Why so angry that multiple people mention it?  I always want to help a small guy any time that I can, but I cannot recommend this company to anybody due to the above issues... Best of luck Jack. I hope you find some happiness so you're not so angry. Honesty is the best policy, had you admitted fault, I would be giving you 5 stars now and recommending you to friends.  Integrity is everything to me.  God bless you.   Update: The epoxy repair was just short of $200 and prevented me from parking in my garage for another 8 days..... This situation probably does not concern most people, but it was a hit to me..... Tired of bad subcontractors costing me money, does nobody have pride or integrity anymore?

Another great Harkins facility, they do it right for sure. Clean snack stand and restrooms, well maintained facility, nice employees, comfortable seating, well done sound and video. Great place, just like the rest of them.

I had Corey and crew out today, they installed some pavers for me. They did it right, the 1/4" minus was tamped and leveled and some sand over top, the pavers were installed in the proper orientation at the proper height and elevations, then the edges were grouted in and finally a fine silica sand was swept into all of the cracks to lock them in place...... If you are getting pavers installed, this is the proper procedure!!!!! It looks so much better than the previous install by a shoddy contractor that had to be removed, night and day. Very professional. Corey and his guys did a great job on the installation. It's perfectly flat and level and just looks amazing. I highly recommend them!!

Best Oregano's I've been to yet. Excellent service and food every time. The employees are always friendly, the place is always clean and well managed. Jordan, one of the managers went out of his way for us a couple of times, great guy. It's people like him that keep us going back to our favorite spots, the being at the top of the list. Keep it up Oregano's, it's a great weekly get away for us.
