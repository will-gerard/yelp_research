I enjoy Bobo China a lot. Their food is good, service is friendly and they deliver. I always get white meat for my chicken dishes and have never been disappointed. I moved from the area and still go out of my way to go here.

I've been going here for 10 years. They are great. I drive out of my way to get my nails done and eyebrows waxed because I know I will be happy every time. I've had both gel and acrylic and I'm always getting compliments on my nails. They are quick, friendly and the prices are great.

Awesome place! The food is good, the service is fast and the people are friendly! It's a bit packed in there, but who cares if you're squeezed in, when the rest is so awesome!

I decided to try this place because of the reviews here on yelp. It has a nice set up. The happy hour specials are great. The sushi had good flavor. The dipping sauce for the tempura was spot on. Sakebombers, awesome. They even had a cool twist on the green tea ice cream. The only downfall was that my waitress could have been a little more attentive.

I love the happy hour specials here! They have great pricing and the food is tasty. I'm not ever really impressed with the waitresses though, so I usually sit at the bar, where you're sure to get great service from the gentlemen who make the sushi.

Don't go here if you're a woman. They just tried to tell my friend she had to purchase a $250 tire, then when she told them  she needed to call her husband, they suddenly found one for her for $100.... hmmm you can make your own judgment on this one. I certainly am disgusted by this type of business practice. Be careful, ladies.

I love the atmosphere here! The drinks are tasty and average price. It's a little small, but I kind of enjoy the intimate vibe. I'll definitely be back.

All I can say is halo halo special! Oh my goodness yum! So good. The noodles are yum. Only down side is the location and the smell, but seriously, get it to go and enjoy! I'll definitely be back!

I'll definitely be returning.  The initial cost to bowl was a bit pricey, but the drinks were very reasonable. I like that it has the gypsy bar right in it and an arcade as well. Cool place and nice service.

This place is good. I went with a friend and both our meals were awesome.  He loved the macaroni salad so much, he got seconds. The BBQ chicken and beef are both delicious.  Their sauces are great. I'll definitely be back!

I would strongly encourage you to never go to Bright Now Dental. Worst experience ever! Their dental hygienist was horrible to my gums, I've never had a cleaning hurt before, but she changed that. Their dentist refilled a cavity, and 9 months later their filling fell out. When I returned to have them fix their error, the dentist cut off a chunk of my gums. Oh! And the cherry on top was that they screwed up my billing. Such an awful experience!  THIS is why people hate going to the dentist.

This was pretty tasty. Their shrimp tacos were delicious.  Loved the goodie bar with salsa, hot carrots and other topping items. The shrimp civiche wasn't great, but it won't hold me back from trying their other dishes. I'll be back.

Oh my gosh! Are you kidding me kids? I ordered an egg white delight and literally got a sliver of egg white and the English muffin is burnt. I'm done. Going to Dunkin Donuts from here on out. The quality is poor, service is slow and I am not sure they've ever managed to get my order right!
