Hands down the best Chinese in Arizona. Food is fantastic but is a little pricey. Always leave with a happy. Great service and clean decor

Absolutely amazing! Staff and food was awesome and great place ! It's not fancy and not a fine and dine restaurant but it's what you expect for an English pub style restaurant. Pasty of all different kinds and has a wide variety for vegetarians. This is a must stop in Tempe...

Ribeye was so so but the butterfish and fried scallops were amazing! Service was spot on and were very friendly.

I have bought 2 cars from this dealership over the years and they are always top notch for quality and cooperation for price. I always leave satisfied and when it's time for service they are always helpful and get me out on time with no over waiting.

Another disappointment in the valley. I was hoping the reviews on yelp helped but no success.

Surprised on how good it was for the fist time. Sushi was very tasty and plentiful. They have soju here which I was excited and it was a good brand.. It's really a diamond in the rough and didn't expect something this good out here in Surprise!
