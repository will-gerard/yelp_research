Probably the best Chinese that I have had in the valley. Prompt service. Vast menu. Eat in or take out. On busy nights, finding parking can be an issue and like every other Chinese spot in the Valley, THEY DON'T HAVE DUCK SAUCE! WTF?!?! Duck sauce must be an East Coast thing...

My go to place for my Sky Harbor parking needs. Van service is quick and reliable. Great customer service. Full service amenities available on site. To me, this is the best off site parking option available.

Nice. Clean. Modern. Easy navigation around the terminals. TSA agents are usually pretty friendly. All in all a good airport to fly into and out of.

I've visited this location a few times and although I have had good customer service, the staff always seems very disorganized and the chicken is always overcooked and dry. 3 times and the same issues occur, which is enough for me not to visit this location again.
