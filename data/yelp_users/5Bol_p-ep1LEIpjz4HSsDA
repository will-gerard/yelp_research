I came tonight with my boyfriend to get fitted for a suit and received the MOST TERRIBLE service. I've come a million times and  leave happy, but that was not the case tonight. The employee asked if we needed help, we said we wanted to check out some of the suits, the employee goes on to ask if we were going to buy, and we explained maybe if we found one that we loved. He then goes on to say that if we weren't going to buy then there was basically no sense in helping us. Very short and rude. I would try another Nordstrom if looking for menswear.

I have tried to come and get my nails done here on 3 separate occasions and each time I've stopped by I was told that they could not "fit me in" when the salon didn't look too busy. Take off the walk ins welcome sign on your front door if walk ins aren't welcome.

This was a great little spot. We stopped by this morning for a quick bite to eat. Apparently things were recently renovated inside and I appreciated the decor and set up. It was busy -- always a good sign!  The food came out quickly and our server was very friendly and attentive. We got an order of buttermilk pancakes and french toast, both were great and generous servings. We got an additional side of bacon and biscuits and gravy. I'm personally not a fan of sausage gravy so I didn't love that as much.   Overall, things were fine and I left with a full stomach.

Such a great little place. Signage has "corner" large and Chloe's small, so don't miss it! We went during lunch rush so seating was a little hard to find but they flipped tables very quickly. I ordered the cold turkey sandwich, got my drink, and by the time I say down at my table they were walking over with my sandwich -- super speedy! Sandwich was delicious and I loved the cranberry walnut bread. Definitely coming back again!

We had a fantastic brunch here this morning. It was Labor Day, so a little busier than normal. We did have to sit in a little table a much in the back corner next to a booth. A little uncomfortable and weird sitting so close to the people next to us.   Food was delicious. I got the French toast. A very healthy serving with four slices of bread and a side of fruit. The boyfriend had the buttermilk pancakes. Also a large serving. Service was great and everything came out quickly. I would definitely recommend this spot!

I've been coming here since I moved out to Tempe for school. They've got the cheapest gel manicure ($22) I've seen and always polite. I come regularly for my eyebrows as well and I always leave happy. They are also open until 7:30 during the week so I'm always able to come late.

The barbecue is yummy and there are several barbecue sauce options. They've got a cute little store with little trinkets, goodies, and home decor items. Overpriced, but still cute. The carwash and cleaning is the best around and they always do a great job. I definitely recommend coming to Toms Thumb!

Thank goodness for people willing to move everything in the Phoenix, AZ summer!  In my opinion, movers are always worth the money. These guys were worth EVERY penny.   We had originally scheduled them to come at 8AM to get things started. About 2 weeks before the move, I had a work conflict and needed to reschedule for a little earlier. An email was sent over and they quickly responded agreeing to the 7AM start time.   Fast forward to moving day. The guys gave us a call around 6:30 letting us know they were on their way. They then called around 7AM explaining they had a truck issue and were running a little late. Completely fine with me because they were meeting us at a storage unit first and the office didn't open until 7AM so that left me some time to run in and take care of everything before they got there. Once the three gentlemen arrived, they went straight to work unloading my 10x10 storage unit in about 20 minutes (not joking) and then we headed off to my sisters apartment. Once we got there, they unloaded their entire 1 bedroom apartment in about 40 minutes. Then, another trip to our new house. They took everything off the truck and even moved a couch from downstairs to upstairs twice (sorry guys!) in no time at all. With three stops and packing and unloading, they did everything in the 2-hour time frame.   The guys were so great and I'm so happy they were there to help. I would recommend them to anyone moving in the valley. Thanks again!

Went this morning right at opening to beat the heat and the crowd. Got in quickly and didn't have to wait for a bay.   We were a little annoyed because the employee at the bay reservation desk told us that it is currently an "iron only facility" so when you bring your own clubs you have to hit off the first deck and you can't bring your driver to the bay. Apparently people have been hitting balls over the net. They offered to check the clubs you weren't allowed to bring but we just ran them back to the car. They should have emailed members and posted signage but they did not.   Our bay was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. Took a few minutes for our server to get there, but she finally brought us waters and we ordered a round of mimosas. Those also took a while to get there -- her reasoning was because they had just opened and so things weren't ready yet (not an excuse). Mimosas were more like a glass of OJ with a splash of champagne which sucked.   Overall golfing experience was fun. They provide rental clubs at each bay if you don't have any. Definitely come for the experience. It's a very cool place.
