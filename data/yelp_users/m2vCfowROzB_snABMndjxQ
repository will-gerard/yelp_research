Haven't dined - in at this location before but I get take-out a lot and the girls helping me at the take-out counter are always so sweet and helpful! We are obsessed with the chocolate chip pazookies, even when you're stuffed, you wouldn't be having the real Oreganos experience without ordering one for dessert! It's a half pound of chocolate chip cookie dough, partly baked with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. SO GOOD!

I have never been treated so rudely upon expressing intrest in buying a car before. I arrived asking to test drive a kia optima and at first, he seemed very willing to help us. As soon as he sat down to do paperwork with us and heard that we were not buying that day and would probably be buying within the next 2 months because we wanted to be sure in our decision about a car he went to get a manager. The manager was helpful and understanding but after we still said that we were not going to buy that day the salesman refused to let us test drive a car. He said "sorry, but you're not buying and I need to feed my family". Is the 15 minute test drive really going to make your family starve? Doubtful. If he had been accomadating, we probably would have bought our car from him when we came back. Well I can promise that when I do buy a kia optima, it will NOT be from him or this location. I would rather pay to have the car shipped elsewhere for me to pick it up, then deal with them again.

The almond butter crunch is my all-time favorite ice cream and my go-to, but some of their flavors are some interesting I love to try them! The coconut curry flavor was actually really delicious, sweet republic never disappoints

This place is awesome. Such a great environment, but sometimes the food feels a little lackluster. The moscow mules are TDF though, definitely recommend!
