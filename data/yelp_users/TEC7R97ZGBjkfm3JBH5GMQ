Can't say enough good things about this hotel. Super clean rooms, snacks all day, beautiful pool, friendly staff and an amazing restaurant attached to the hotel in the down stairs lobby. They also offer bikes to cruise the town. I have never seen any other Hotel offer that service. We had an amazing time here and cannot wait to come back.

Not impressed... have had way better food from a street side taco shop for far less money $25 for 3 tacos and one quesadilla

Such a fun place to come and have a beer and dinner with friends....  I had a burrito, guacamole and chips. Ingredients were very fresh and everything tasted amazing the guacamole is to die for. We will definitely be back. Can't wait to try more of this amazing menu. Cheers
