I have been here a handful of times now. Although I am not a fan of their Soft Tofu, everything else seems to be well-prepared. They also have good side dishes.

Rinaldi's is right by my workplace and I have always wanted to try it. I finally did today, and will not be going back.   The chicken parmesan sandwich I bought was awful. It looked and tasted like they put cheese, bread crumbs, and tomato sauce in a blender and squirted the mix on bread. You wouldn't think it was a chicken parm. sandwich. Where is the chicken?  It is also very expensive. If I did not have to rush back for work, I would have said something.   Please, save yourself money and time. It is gross.

I approve of this place. Although the food is not phenomenal, this is the best I have found across the valley so far. The food tastes authentic and there are actual Japanese people working. This place is simply at another level compared with the many fake sushi places around.

Yuck!   I ordered Chicken Piccata (which comes with mashed potatoes and vegetables). It tasted like a microwavable dinner removed from the box and put on a plate. The vegetables were a joke.   My friend ordered a Chopped Cobb salad, which was clearly pre-made since the bowl and fork that came with it was ice-cold. A pre-made salad would typically be fine, except the iceberg lettuce was brown-ish and the fresh tomatoes were so mushy it looked like salsa.   Sadly, the only thing that was good here was the carrot cake they provided in the bread basket. This is a place I will definitely not re-visit.

I am a lover of Mexican food and have tried many places across the Valley; this joint is awesome.   I had their fish tacos, and they were well-prepared and delicious. Their salsa bar was also very nice. What I appreciated most was that they are not stingy with portions. They included large chunks of beer-battered fish in my fish tacos (which the tortillas weren't even able to hold).  I wasn't a big fan of their rice, but everything else made up for it. I will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place.

I have always wanted to try Bavarian Point and finally did tonight; the other German restaurant in that same complex was closed for the holidays.   It was an awful experience! Not only was the food bad and overpriced, the service was terrible. Our server was slow-moving and rude.  When we walked in, there was a sign that stated, "Please wait to be seated." We stood there for two minutes, but no one came. We decided to seat ourselves and there was still no service! After waiting for a while, the busser finally brought us waters and silverware. The server decided to make an appearance and take our order before giving us menus. When I asked for menus, she responded, "Oh...she didn't bring you menus? Isn't that funny?" and stared at me awkwardly for a good five seconds. It really wasn't funny. She then got the busser's attention and glared at her for not bringing us menus. I couldn't help but think, "Well....can you bring us some menus now????" After some time of staring and glaring, she went to get us menus. Of course, we wouldn't see her for a while after that.   After getting our menus and figuring out what to order, I kept trying to get her attention. When she finally saw my hand go up, she said in a rude tone "I'll be back. I need two seconds. JUST TWO SECONDS, OKAY?" and went back into the kitchen. She came back five minutes later and instead of asking, "What would you like to order?", she asked "Are you in a hurry or something?" After I responded, "I'm just really hungry.", she said, "well, we're very busy tonight." (There were about five tables seated at the time and the restaurant was clearly NOT busy.)   When I asked for the salad bar option to go with my dinner, she commented, "well that'll be good, since you're very hungry." If I wasn't with my coworker, I would've walked out.  As for the food, the schnitzel I ordered had a weird rubbery texture and was not breaded(!?!!) The mashed potatoes tasted like it came from a box.   The whole meal was disappointing. I definitely will not be back!

I decided to check this place out simply because it was close to my hotel and looked nice from the outside. I ordered Linguine w/White Clam Sauce and was very content. Even the garlic bread was delicious.  The service: not so great. I was seated outside and had to wait a very long time just for my server to take my order. After I received my food, she was still inattentive.

I love this place!!!  I'll admit...I haven't tried all that many things here, but that's because I always end up going because I'm craving linguine w/white clam sauce. However, everything looks delicious! I have also tried their chicken parm., which is good.  I like this place because you get good food at an affordable price. There is nothing fancy about this place; they use cheap silverware and ugly plates, but who cares? The food is great! if you order a whole pasta meal, you get garlic bread, a quality side salad, and a large-portioned entree. The garlic bread is not great, but I can live with that.  I will certainly be back to try their sandwiches, prepared salads, and desserts.

Overall, I had a very unpleasant experience. I decided to check this place out because "Cafe Ga Hyang", which I was planning to go to, is now closed on Mondays.  When I walked in the restaurant, I was greeted by the sushi bar chef, but had no idea if I should seat myself or wait for someone. The restaurant was almost completely empty...there was only one other person dining in. Eventually a lady walked over and sat me down at a table with a menu. Then, the waiting begins...  Within a minute, I already knew what I was going to order, but unfortunately for me, the waitress had her back completely against me and was socializing with another waitress. They were chatting it up, laughing, and having a great time, while I was sitting there trying to get the other waitress' attention. At some point, the phone rang, and she walked over to the sushi bar area to pick up. I somehow thought that she would finally come over after the phone call, but instead she walked back to the other waitress to continue her exciting conversation.   I couldn't take it anymore and walked up to both of them and gave her my order. She did say "sorry", but I was still appalled at how unprofessional they were.  I ordered kalbi tang, which is something I usually get when I go to korean restaurants. It was overly salty and peppery and tasted like they added fish-flavoring to the broth. The beef was also tough. The banchan (side dishes) tasted very old; the kimchi was really weird. At korean restaurants, I usually ask for more side dishes, but in this case, I couldn't finish any of it. The best thing on the table was the white rice that came with the kalbi tang. I will not be back!

WARNING: CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT! They are con artists!  A friend and I had lunch here. A few days later we discovered that they had added $2.00 each ($4.00 total) on top of what we tipped. My friend called the restaurant and they claimed that it was because we had paid with two credit cards (split). Not only is this charge ridiculous, but it would have been more appropriate to add it to the pre-tip amount or inform us about the charge when we put two cards down. Increasing the amount AFTER WE LEAVE is simply deceptive. From reading other reviews, it appears that we are not the only ones that have experienced this.  The food is mediocre and, as other reviewers state, the service is poor. I will certainly not be back.

After reading many decent reviews and seeing how close the restaurant was to home, I decided to give it a try.  The young lady at the counter was impatient and had no interpersonal skills. The food was just not good; this place is 'Chinese take-out' at best.

Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent. It therefore deserves five stars!

I had dinner here with two friends on a Thursday night; their happy hour selection wasn't very extensive, and the dishes on the conveyor belt were unappetizing.  The service wasn't too bad and the waitresses visited frequently, except when one of them took away my miso soup which I was still working on; she ended up bringing it back.  We ordered a variety of rolls (including ones that were off the H.H. menu), none of which I can say were good. Their miso soup was very bland and had an odd mushroom flavor. We also ordered tuna sashimi, which was bad quality and served at room temperature (gross!); I stopped eating the sashimi after the first piece.  Also, I didn't like how there weren't any sesame seeds on any of the rolls!!  The food here is expensive and unappealing. I do not plan on giving this place another shot.

I just moved to the area and decided to try this place. When I walked in, it took a while to get service. I had to walk to the bar area to get someone's attention. I am just going to assume that it's because I went in between lunch and dinner.  The pizza...was delicious!  I ordered an Eggplant and Garlic Pizza with a side salad. The crust was thin and had great texture; the sauce was flavorful. The eggplant was thinly sliced (not overly thin, but just right) and spread throughout the pizza along with fresh mozzarella, fresh garlic, and basil.   The side "Crust Salad" was just okay (half of it was iceberg lettuce) and a bit pricey for what you get.  I will certainly be back to try other items on their menu.

I have been getting my haircuts with Dustin for the past several months now and have been very pleased each time. Dustin is very skilled, consistent, and pays close attention to detail. In addition to being talented at his craft, Dustin is also genuinely friendly, calm, and unpretentious. I also appreciate that he doesn't talk my ear off while he's working on my hair.  The salon is very clean and comfortable. They always have a variety of snacks and soft beverages set up on the side. I almost always have a pack or two (or three!) of Welch's fruit snacks each time I'm there, although I didn't have any today. Yes, I am the one eating all the packets of fruit snacks!!  5 stars, hands down.

Oh God, this place was awful. This is hands down the worst Korean food I have tasted in my life (no exaggeration). This is what Korean food would probably taste like in rural North Dakota (no offense, North Dakotans!). I really have nothing good to say about this place.   This place is expensive and serves significantly smaller portions than typical korean restaurants. The $15 seafood pancake (which had very little seafood and  tasted very fishy/gross) was half the size of what would typically served. The $10 soft tofu stew was bland and came in a very small pot (almost like a small bowl); the beef in there was extremely tough.  Our server (very likely the owner) was inattentive and stingy with side dishes; we had to ask him to refill twice because it was simply not enough. The portions started off small, but only got smaller and smaller as we asked for more.  If you want decent korean food, drive a few miles south to Hodori.

Awful experience!   I had a question about their current sale and decided to approach the guy on the floor; he was clearly not interested in helping me and answered me impatiently while walking away. (Didn't think too much of it since he did answer my question.)  I spent about an hour picking out a bunch of items and decided to walk over to the cashier and put my clothing on hold (so that I didn't have to carry around so much stuff as I continued to shop). She asked for my name and the time I planned to pick it; I gave her my name and told her that I was just going to browse some more and be right back. She said "OK".  Within 15 min., I picked up two more items and was ready to go. When I got back to the cashier (same lady!), she forgot who I was. After giving her my name, she looked around and told me she couldn't find it and that someone must have put everything back. She acted as if it wasn't her fault and asked me to go get the items again.  I had to go back onto the floor and try to recall everything I picked out. There was of course an item that I ended up not being able to find. Then when I got back, I remembered there was a sweater that I forgot about. Curse them! I should have just held on to my clothing for 15 more min.!!!

Since going under new management recently, this establishment has transformed. The owner (who is always there) is very friendly and energetic. He really takes his time to welcome customers and explain the menu options, which I give him a lot of credit for.  I usually go during my lunch break and get the 'grilled hot dog special' which comes with cole slaw, a pickle, fries, and a drink for six bucks. The food is good and well-priced; even their cole slaw is awesome. They are very generous with their toppings, which they very much encourage you to use but do not charge for.  To sum it up, it is a very comfortable place to be in with good food.

I came here based on the positive reviews. How is this place still operating?  I ordered the Beef Noodles w/Oyster Sauce. It tasted like something a college freshman put together in his dorm room. I was shocked that they were serving something like this in a restaurant.  The sauce was a thick gravy that was not characteristic of any type of cuisine I have ever tasted. It was sweet and very SALTY; it kind of tasted like a blend of soy sauce, mushrooms, and milk. Once again, I can't put my finger to it, but it was gross. The beef was extremely starchy and rubbery. I tried to cover the taste up with hot sauce, but that didn't work.  One of the ladies (probably the owner or a manager) was nice enough to replace it with their Beef Noodle Soup. This was not disgusting like the first dish, but did not taste good either. The broth was bland and tasted like boiled water with cilantro and a splash of soy sauce.  I left very unsatisfied. I hope readers will take my review seriously and not waste money there.

I am now sitting in the nearby Starbucks eating sweets to get rid of the awful taste of the food I just had at Kokoro. I felt so strongly about this place that I needed to write a review immediately, before I forget.  I ordered Katsu Don and thought it was disgusting; it was not only very salty, but was covered with Vietnamese chili paste. I like salt and spice, but Katsu Don is not supposed be very salty nor should it be spicy! I ended up not finishing it.  Everything on the menu is wayyyy overpriced for what they are serving. I noticed that the other table also left without finishing their food. I can't believe this place has been around.

Bad food. BAD service.  I ordered Cheeseburger Sliders and Tots. The sliders were a joke and the tots tasted like they were fried in very old oil.   While I was chatting with my friends and waiting for the food, our server came over and slammed my plate down in front of me, which actually scared me and made me jump. Later on, I asked for hot sauce, and when she brought it over, she of course walked by quickly (without any eye contact) and also slammed it on the table. Everything she said to us was lazy, slurred, and unclear. On multiple occasions, we would have to ask each other "What did she say?". It was clear that she didn't want to be there. There is no reason for that bad attitude, especially since we did nothing that could have annoyed her.  Trust the negative reviews! Don't go here!

I was very excited when I saw the 'Coming Soon' sign prior to their opening and was looking forward to dining here. I have been there twice now, and do not intend on going back. The food is not bad, but overall, my experience was unsatisfactory.  Not only are they overpriced, but they are stingy. I absolutely hate restaurants who charge a fortune, but have little to offer. Both times I came, I ordered the 1/2 'Pollo a la Brasa'; the second time, they did not give me fries. I was told that they no longer offer fries with the meal. Not only is this false advertising on the menu, but this just shows how cheap they are. How expensive are potatoes??  Please don't order the Yuca fries. The $6 order comes with 5 fries, literally. If you are willing to pay over a dollar for a 2-inch fried potato, then by all means go for it.  The waitress I had was impatient and gave me all sorts of strange looks each time I tried to get her attention. When I asked for sauce for the chicken (which should have come with it), she looked at me as If I was absolutely insane. If it were not for my co-worker treating, I would have made sure the server received minimal tip.  I do not intend on going back to support a business like this one.

Awful, awful, awful!   I have been here and to the Mesa location many times and have found the therapists to be very inconsistent. Considering the cost and close proximity to home, I have been quite forgiving of any shortcomings. However, today's massage, if you could call it that, was the worst I have ever received; it was more like a bad rub.   The gentleman who was giving the massage was terrible. It seemed like he had little idea what to do and was just trying to fill 60 minutes. His motions were not only unpredictable (with no pattern) but extremely rapid and aggressive. I had a lot of trouble relaxing because he kept shaking my body for most of the session and his heavy breathing certainly didn't help.   There was also a lot of chatting going on between the therapists and a vibrating cell phone that kept going off. Someone turn it off, please!!!  To make things worse, when I walked out I felt very itchy and noticed that I had gotten two mosquito bites during my massage, one on my forearm and one on my left eyelid.   Since the receptionist didn't make any contact with me after the massage was over, I decided to walk over. She then asked me if I enjoyed the massage. After I told her that it was "not very good", her response was, "Oh, okay."  WHAT?????  I also want to add that I hate how in the evening time, they ask clients to pay/tip first.   Bad massage. Bad customer service. This place has just lost my business.

Although a bit overpriced, this place is quite good. I have been here several times now and have tried the green tea and thai tea flavors; the ice is very fluffy and light like snow. My favorite is green tea ice with red bean, almond pudding, and condensed milk. I try to stop by when I go to Cherry Blossom. I wish this place was closer to me!

Yuck!   I saw this place open up not too long ago and was excited to try it out. I went in tonight with low expectations, keeping in mind that this is still a "fast-food type" place, but the food was just awful. I am not a Panda Express fan, so I wouldn't suggest you go there, but you may as well (considering what they serve here)!  I ordered Vietnamese Beef Pho, Kung Pao Chicken, and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  The Iced Coffee was pre-mixed and poured into my cup from a large plastic container; you could get better pre-mixed iced coffee from 7-11 at half the cost. Don't be deceived; this is not what Vietnamese Iced Coffee should taste like.  The Pho was very bland and inedible, and is the worst I've tasted in my life (no exaggeration). The broth was completely flavorless; I believe they just used the water they boiled the noodles in. The noodles were thick and mushy. The beef was in cut in chunks (not-sliced) and was very tough. I just couldn't get myself to finish this.  The Kung Pao Chicken didn't taste as bad as the other two items, but was pathetic for what you pay. The portion is small; there are only a few pieces of chicken with very little vegetables. The container was mostly sauce and rice.  ...very disappointing.

To all ramen enthusiasts: if you're looking for the real deal, this place doesn't have it.   If you never had real ramen (like the reviewer below) and are just comparing to store-bought cup noodles, then yes, of course this is better; it is also 20x the cost of your cup noodle!!  I ordered a bowl of miso ramen with roast pork and corn. Although ramen is usually salty, this bowl was overly salty and lacked that richness usually found in the broth. The roast pork was shredded and served ice-cold (literally) on top of the ramen, which made the whole bowl lukewarm; they had to warm up my friend's charshu pork, because it was also cold. Even though it was a hot day, I would have preferred my ramen to be hot like it's supposed to be! The actual noodles were just mediocre.  I see this as more of a fast-food-type place for the local college students.  Will I be back? Likely not.

i was excited to see that a new Korean restaurant opened up and decided to drive over for dinner. Both the food and the service were very disappointing.  The service was beyond terrible. I walked in and had to seat myself because no one gave me any direction. I sat there for five minutes and no one came over, so I went to get a menu myself. I waited for 10 minutes and still no one came over to take my order. There were two tables right next to mine, and the female server brought items to their tables while I was sitting there trying to get her attention. After 15 minutes of just sitting, eventually the male server came over and took my order.  For a place called "Ban Chan", their ban chan is not only very limited, but gross. There were a total of 4 side dishes, 3 of which were odd and inedible. The cooked turnip had a very fishy taste to it, then there were the mushy/flavorless collared greens, the picked vegetable and pickled turnip were just not good. All of the side dishes were lukewarm.  I ordered Haemul Pajun (Seafood pancake); it was thick and full of undercooked green onion.The Kalbitang was very salty.  It was a very disappointing meal.

This place is very confused. It is a Vietnamese restaurant in a dirty dive bar setting, with a pool table and several flat screen TVs, and 60s music blasting in the background. My water was served in a faded Rebel IPA glass. The lighting was very odd and the place felt dark and sticky. There is also no way of looking into the restaurant from the outside, because the windows are covered and the doors have no windows.  Upon entering, a female server approached me and asked "what's up?"; when I told her I was dining in, she told me to sit anywhere. The male server I had appeared to be high and his speech was slurred and difficult to understand. There were only four other tables seated, but yet the two servers were literally running around the restaurant.  I ordered a pork chop combo (pork chop, rice, egg roll, fried egg, and chicken wings). The rice was wet and mushy and tasted like chlorine. The filling inside the egg roll tasted spoiled. Everything else was greasy and tasteless. I couldn't finish any part of my meal.  I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant down the block.

I was excited to see this place open and thought it would be great have another lunch spot in the area. The experience was disappointing.  As others have mentioned, they really do nickel and dime you. I was originally planning to get the $11 grilled shrimp plate, and when I asked if I could substitute the rice with veggies, they said that there would be a $2 charge. Come on...are veggies really THAT much more expensive? Just substitute it! This is not a way to do business. I wasn't going to pay $13 for shrimp and veggies from a walk-up-to-the-counter place!  I thought I would go with the cheaper $10 grilled shrimp salad. I asked for dressing on the side, but when I got my order, the dressing was mixed in; they also forgot to add the roasted peppers. The most ridiculous part was, it came with THREE SMALL shrimps; the bulk of it was spring mix. I spoke with the lady that put my order together and she confirmed that the salad does only come with three shrimps, but that she would remake the salad without the dressing.   The lady was friendly and the manager checked up on me at some point, but that was the only positive part of my visit. The salad was boring and unsatisfying. For that price, they could at least add avocado, an egg, or something more filling....perhaps more shrimp?  I hope they get their act together. For now, be prepared to spend a good amount of money and leave hungry. I am sure they are making a whopping profit!

I was very excited about this Popeye's opening up and have been to this location three times since its opening. The other negative reviews are accurate and reflect my experiences as well.  First, the staff members, including the managers in the green shirts, are very unprofessional. The staff is always standing and joking around and not paying attention to the restaurant. The hot sauce openings are crusty, as another reviewer mentioned, and the tables are left unwiped and dirty. It is difficult to find a clean table or seats, as they ALL have oil streaks or fried chicken crumbs on them.  Second, the food is always lukewarm. Don't count on getting a hot meal here; they serve their chicken and mashed potatoes at room temperature.  Third, they REALLY DO get your order wrong. If you decide to come here, do yourself a favor and check your order. In one of my visits, I waited for a long time and the tall male manager told me that they were waiting for the "fries to cook." I didn't even order fries!!! After he finally put my meal together, he left out my mashed potatoes! It was frustrating.  In my most recent visit, I overheard the female manager having an extended conversation with a customer on the phone (in front of everybody!!), saying that she was unable to offer a refund unless they bring the food back in. It was obvious they got someone's order wrong. A few minutes into the conversation, she said in a rude voice "I AM the manager!" and soon hung up. She then proceeded by yelling into the kitchen requesting for some help up front.
