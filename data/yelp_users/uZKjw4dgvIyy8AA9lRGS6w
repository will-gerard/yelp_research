Came in to get 6 xerox copies done on cardstock, that I brought in.  Their do it yourself xerox do not like cardstock so I always have them do it behind their counter and in 30 seconds, it's done.  Oh not today! The young lady behind the counter said you'll have to wait for it. I said ok, no problem.  Thinking it will be like 15-20 min. She's filling out a form and said "I can TRY to do this before my shift is over at 7:00 tonight."  Ummm, it's 2:45pm now, why the hell would I wait here until your shift gets done with and with the chance that my 6 xerox copies get done.?!   She did say that her copier has been down since Friday.  Ugh, kids. Why would she say you can wait, why would she say she will TRY to get it done before her shift is over and why would she said they could do it if their copier has been down for the last 5 days!!  Not going back to this Staples.

After constantly putting air in my tires EVERY morning for 2 weeks I finally decided to take care of it.  I have always had my husband deal with everything that involves the word CAR.  I went online to look up the closest location and found one 5 minutes away from me and I was able to make an appointment online.  Got to Discount Tire about 10 minutes early was seen quickly. They took my car back and told me it would be about 45 minutes.  I am sure glad I made an appointment, a lady came in and asked how long she would be there and she was told an hour and a half.  My name was called 20 minutes into my arrival.  Was told there was a nail in my tire and they fixed it...FOR FREE!  They didn't try to sell me on new tires or protection plans, nothing!. Gave me my keys and I was on my way. I highly recommend getting an appointment so you don't have to wait long.

Urgency and customer service is not one of their strong points at this location in the afternoon.  Waiting in line while someone was figuring out what to order. One gal at the cash register and 3 baristas just talking while there was a line. It's kind of annoying when you see employees just standing around talking while customers are waiting. They could have opened the other cash register or started making the drinks for the others in line that knew what they wanted; just like they do in other Starbucks.  I will say I've been to this location a few times before and have had great service.  The gal working the register was very kind and said thanks for waiting.  If you're looking to get a quick drink in the afternoon, try a drive thru location.

Early dinner before the Chaparral High School football game.  Got right in with no problems, well I guess so, it was 5:30.  Our server was very sweet, she asked if we wanted a sample of Pinot Noir. We didn't.  She gave me a good recommendation for wine and she was very personable and seemed to enjoy her job.  So nice to see happy employees!   My dad knew what he wanted, he orders it everytime, the chicken tequila fettichini with extra limes.  I usually do a pizza but splurged and went for the pesto cream penne.  I enjoyed it but I was confused with them calling it pesto. I didn't see much if any pesto. And the cream sauce was hardly there the penne was dry on the top. It looked like the sauce was not mixed in with the pasta.  Some of the penne tasted undercooked.  Overall, the dish was ok. Probably won't order it again.  Might just stick with the pizza next time.

Had dinner last night at Elements.  It was our first time there. We started out in the bar. I'm not a big drinker and I ordered a margarita. Jason, the awesome bartender, offered to make a special margarita for me. When he put this amazing creation in front of me, I thought he must have ESP or I had the words "love strawberries" written on my forehead cause this was a strawberry margarita.  Turns out he talked to my husband and found out about my strawberry obsession.  I asked him what he called it and he asked what my name was and the name of the drink was Leanne's Surprise.  Don't ask me what was in it cause I can't remember but it was wonderful.  Thanks again Jason.  We then went to the dining room and our table was in the far corner with floor to ceiling windows on both sides. Best inside table in the whole place. The views are beautiful. Next time I go I will try for sunset.  I ordered their off menu special the NY Strip. I'm normally a filet kind of gal but I wanted the potatoes and shrimp as well. So our server did the bacon wrapped filet with the sides of the special. So happy he did that for me. It was amazing. I posted a picture of it.  The desserts our table shared was the Peanut Butter Bomb and the Pretzel Bar. Both were incredible.  Elements is pricey so I'd say this is a special occasion type place, for me.  Looking forward to coming back and having the Leanne's Surprise margarita!

Maximum Fitness is a hidden gem.  I've been working out there for the last 3 months or so.  This is not your big chain luxury gym.  Maximum is a non meat market gym.  The equipment is not the latest and greatest but it does what it's supposed to do.   Everyone I've met that works there and it's members are friendly.  I've been working with a group 3 x a week  with trainer Karen Mullarkey.  Karen is amazing, great trainer and works with all fitness levels.  I've had back and neck pain so she takes peoples injuries into consideration and personalizes your workouts.  Check out her website.  http://www.karenmullarkey.com/  This has made working out more fun with the group. It's a kind of family feeling with everyone encouraging you.

We've been bringing our cats to Hillside Animal Hospital for years.   This place is amazing.  There are so many wonderful things to say about Hillside.  5 years ago we moved to the area and we had had previous vet care from a place in Chandler where they couldn't diagnose what was wrong with our cat, Tuffy.  Dr. Rosonke is THE MAN, he was able to diagnose our little boy and we had a great treatment plan.     Hillside is a one stop Doctors visit for your furry babies.  They have everything they need in house. You don't need to schedule separate appointments to go to a specialist or a lab to get tests done.  Dr. Rosonke and his staff can do it ALL!     The front lobby and exam rooms are warm, trendy and inviting; not the typical cold and smelly vets office you're used to.  In one of the exam rooms, they have a couch with a tv in it where my cat can sit and watch the aquarium fish tank channel.  In each exam room is a computer plus flat screen so they can go over all test results, ultrasounds, X-rays, etc. with you.   On the wall are artsy animal pictures; no Garfield and Otis pictures in here!  Oh, and they also have a gift shop with fun toys, collars, leeches and food that are all carefully picked with the staff's stamp of approval.   The customer service at Hillside is amazing. Everyone is super friendly.  It's kind of like walking into Cheers, everyone knows your name.  As soon as you open the doors you're greeted by your first name, they even greet your pet too.   The environment feels wonderful, they are all in great moods, smiling and looks like a happy work family.  You won't need to worry about anyone mistreating your pet cause they're having a bad day.   I will never take our animals anywhere else.  We love Hillside Animal Hospital.

Honestly, I had no idea that AZ88 was still around but when I heard it was still open I was excited to go back and visit.  It had been a good 13 years since I have been there.  I went in late at night for some dessert with a small group of friends.  We sat out on the patio, it was a beautiful night.  This is a great place for people watching.  I had the Keylime pie which is up there to the likes of Keylime pie in Key West, Florida.

I've been coming to Chino for YEARS!  I won't say how long cause it makes me feel old.  Tonight I brought in some first timers!  They loved it!  The service is always friendly, the price is amazing and the food is great.  I forgot to tell the newbies about the famous Volcano Cookies,... next time.  Just wished there was a Scottsdale location.

My first time at Chelsea's Kitchen.  Went for brunch with a small group of ladies. We sat on the patio and it was wonderful. We had ordered the deviled eggs with bacon. Oh my yummy. I could have had 5 orders of that myself. I'm still craving it now.  Also had a mimosa, the hot cakes with a side of bacon.  I personally didn't like the hotcakes but a couple gals at our table tried it and they enjoyed it.   My only one tiny complaint is the shedding of the trees above all the patio tables. They do give tons of shade so I cant complain too much. Just make sure to watch when you take a bite or drink that you don't take in twigs or leaves.  The server even had twigs in the water jug she used to fill our waters so one of us had the surprise twig added to her water.  Oh and have a friend check your hair before you leave to get all the leaves out of your hair. Yeah, you'll look like a couple of monkeys searching for bugs in their fur, but everyone else would be doing it too.  Looking forward to going back for lunch and dinner and having more deviled eggs!

My experience last night at Maggiano's was impressive and disappointing at the same time.   I made a reservation for 6 people for Mother's Day dinner.  We were being seated to our table and we headed to the back room where I guess they do private parties.  It didn't excite my Mom to be in the back room where a lot of the screaming kids were so we asked for a table in the dining room and it wasn't a problem.    Matt was our server for the evening.  He told my Mom happy Mother's Day and she just loved that coming from such a good looking guy!  Matt was awesome, service was great.  I hope to have him as a server again.   My disappointing part of the evening was my food.  I had the Gnocchi which was cold and the portion size was small.  The plate and marinara sauce was hot but the gnocchi was not.  I have been to Maggiano's many times before and have had the gnocchi many times before and it's always a good size portion and is hot.   Everyone else's food at my table was a big size and was at the right temperature.  So I ate some of my husband dish, the rustic chicken and shrimp which was very good, not to mention hot and a good portion.  I asked Matt for a box and he boxed it up for me so I could take it home and heat it up myself.    To get my experience on the positive side, I twisted my own arm and ordered the tiramisu.  Yeah, it's up on my top 5 tiramisu's I've ever had.  I highly recommend ordering it and sharing it.   I will go back to Maggiano's and I probably won't order the gnocchi again due to the portion size. $15 for what I got last night, 75 cents per gnocchi piece was not worth it.   My star rating for service is 5 stars and my rating for the gnocchi is a 1 star.

Went to The Vig last night with a couple of girlfriends.  Parking, plan on Valet cause that's the only thing available.  We got our own car without them bringing it to us since it was 12 feet away so that was $3 that I wish I was not forced to spend.  No idea if there is self parking anywhere else.  We sat in one of the long booths on the patio. We were greeted by Meow Meow, The Vig's resident cat. Well, my friend and I are crazy cat ladies so we just loved that.  The menu, looked amazing. I will have to go back many times to order everything I wanted.  I could not hold back from ordering their Mac and Cheese. Got it with bacon and chicken.  I'm so glad I got it.  This Mac and Cheese was very good. The portion was huge so I was more than happy to take the rest home with me.   Looking forward to going back and playing corn hole.  My review would be a 5 star had it not been for the parking.

Came in for a pedi after my favorite pedi lady went MIA at another salon.  After much research on YELP, I decided on Q Royal.  I read some bad reviews and then realized the salon got new management and after that all the reviews were positive.  I am happy I had tried Q Royal and will be coming back.  They had a huge selection of polishes they do a nice job of putting like colors together so you're not spending 10 minutes searching for the different shades of red.   Maya was super nice and spoke great English, so there was no communication issues.  She did a wonderful job.  Maya spoiled my legs, my feet and my toes.  There was no holding back with the leg and foot massage.  Next time, I will pay extra for a longer massage.  Speaking of massage, the chairs they have for each pedi station was amazing.  The chairs are in great condition and the remote is easy to control unlike others I have sat in.  Oh and each pedi station has it's very own iPad that is connected to the Internet to mess around or work if you have to. (You won't be thinking of work while getting a pedi, trust me!)  they do provide free wifi if you need it.  I also saw a cute couple that came in and it was refreshing to see a guy come in for a mani and pedi.  I said I wish I could get my husband to come in for a pedi.  The masculine guy said his mani and pedi was amazing and he would be coming back. I asked him to take a pic of him so I could prove to my husband that men do get mani and pedi's.  I hope I can talk him into coming with me.   Looking forward to coming back to have Maya spoil me again.  Thanks Maya!

This is only place I go to when I am feeling under the weather. I am able to check in on their website before I get there which puts me on their wait list. That way I don't have to sit in the waiting room long.  I prefer this to going to a doctor cause you can get in and don't have to wait for 3 months to see someone. I doubt I would still be sick with the flu in 3 months.  The staff is friendly and sympathetic to you when you're feeling horrible.   I had a cold this last time and they were able to give me cough medicine in site. It was nice having a "one stop shop."  When they do prescribe meds that they don't have on hand they are nice enough to call it in to your pharmacy.  Hopefully, I won't have to go back but when I do get sick this is the place I will be going to.

Was not sure if we'd be getting service or not.  Came in for dinner & drinks with a small group of ladies and I felt like we were bothering the host and servers for being there.   It took a long time to get menus and once we ordered, it was an hour before we got our food. (3 burgers, 1 salad and 1 mac & cheese).  After awhile the service from our server got a bit better.   Food was good.  If you're wanting to sit and wait a long for service & food and don't mind being snubbed by the staff, this is the place for you.

Made a reservation on Open Table, which I love, and in the notes I explained it was our 12th Anniversary.  My Husband thought of a idea of opening a bottle of wine that we purchased on our trip to Napa. It's a special occasion type bottle.  I did a search online to see if they do a corkage fee.  I came across a website called No Corkage Fees.com.  http://nocorkagefees.com/directory/locality/Scottsdale/#.VES0QNm9LCQ It gives the restaurants number and address so I know I was getting the right place.  I called and a very young sounded lady, answered the phone Bourbon Steak.  I told her I had a reservation and was coming in for my anniversary dinner and was wondering if I could bring in a bottle of wine. She was quiet for a minute and said that we could do so.  We were very excited that we could bring in a bottle that we had been saving for a special occasion from our Napa trip.  I have to admit, I didn't read my fellow Yelpers reviews and I wish I would have.  After seeing the restaurant, to me, this is not a romantic Anniversary dinner type place.  We got to the restaurant and go to what we thought was the hostess stand.  Waited for a few minutes and then we started walking around the restaurant to try to find someone who worked there.  Finally found a server and I asked if there was a Hostess. The server said yes and was looking around to locate one or the only hostess. He started to walk us back to the hostess stand and I told him he didn't need to take us back and for him to please let the hostess know that we are waiting.  A few more minutes went by and a pretty redhead lady came by and said sorry for the wait.  I told her my name and she said Happy Anniversary.  That was a nice touch.  There was a young lady that showed up behind her, which I assumed was another hostess. They both were talking very low to each other so that I could not hear then the pretty redhead started whispering to the other hostess. I thought that was a bit unnecessary and rude to be whispering to each other when someone is standing right in front of them.  Not sure what they were talking about. The 1st hostess started to take us to our table and as we were walking around I was expecting something very different. The decor is not your traditional steakhouse. The dining room is very bright.  We were sat in a corner but there was another couple sitting next to us and they looked mad that we sat down.  The tables were super close to each other.  My husband was sitting across the table and I was closer to the other guest than I was him, it was very awkward.  We did have a Happy Anniversary card that was sitting on the table when we sat down which was nice.  Glad I picked it up quick cause it had been on fire from the tea light candle.  I took our special bottle of wine out of my purse and places it on the table.  We sat there for a good 6 minutes before a server came to greet us.  The table next to us had been there for awhile and had water and menus.  During that time we again felt very awkward with this other table being so close. We looked around the dining room to see if there were any other possibilities of moving tables to be somewhat private. Didn't see one that would have worked.  Our server came and asked us what we wanted to drink then gave us menus. We showed him our bottle and the server said I am going to have to ask a manager.  I told him I called ahead and specifically asked and was told that I could bring it in.  The table next to us still was not approached by a server and they looked mad, not sure if it was the lack of service or the fact that we were extremely close to them.  They actually got up and left.  I was actually a bit relieved that they left, it was weird uncomfortable.  I still felt weird here cause of how bright it was and I knew we would have other people sat next to us.  The 1st hostess came and started to pour us water and she said that it was AZ State Law that they can't open our bottle.  I told her I specifically called and spoke to someone who said it was ok.  She asked for the name who I spoke to, I said I didn't remember and that it was a young lady.  Then she asked if I called the right place. Yes, I called the correct restaurant they answered the phone Bourbon Steak.  I then told her about the website No Corkage Fees.com and that's how I got their number.  We both decided that we would leave.  The pretty redhead, what we thought was a hostess said that she was the assistant manager and asked what was wrong.  We told her and she asked if we would like another table, we said no. We said the evening here isn't going well and we want to enjoy our anniversary.  She did offer to make reservations somewhere else and we said no.  My review is on poor customer service and awkward seating arrangements.  The food may be wonderful but we will never know.  I also want to say that I am fine with not being able to bring our own bottle of wine if that is a AZ State Law, just don't tell me it is ok.

What a bummer, service was minimal, food was eh.  I had been to Cafe Pino once before and after tonight, I won't be coming back.  Came in for dinner with a girlfriend.  I met her there and got there about 15 min early so I decided to sit down in a booth.  The restaurant had one party inside and 2 on the patio. Place was dead.  Well, it was a Wednesday night.  The booth seats are close to being ripped apart.  They were all cracked. Glad I was wearing jeans, if I was wearing a skirt or shorts I know that seat would have been uncomfortable.  So I was seated by an employee and waited for 12 minutes to get someone to come to my table to ask if I wanted a drink or water.  My friend showed up and a it took another 5 minutes for a server to come to the table to see if she wanted a drink. She ordered a glass of wine.... Oh, they are all out of that kind.  It's a Wednesday and the place is empty, how can you be out of a certain kind of wine?!  We were given 2 menus.  One was the specials that was a front and back laminated that looked to be printed with a home printer in Times New Roman and the other menu looked to be professionally printed.  It was just confusing.  My girlfriend had been there a couple of times before and these specials were the same ones.  We did get bread with oil and vinegar.  Bread was nothing to brag about, it was flat and hard.  We both ordered the Pasta Tuscan with chicken. She ordered hers spicy.  Which was not.  But she said she liked it. I enjoyed mine as well.  While we were having dinner we kept hearing this banging.  We looked around thinking we would find a kid making the noise like banging a booster seat.  Come to find out it was an employee sweeping into a dust pan. This was around 8:30  and there were more people in the restaurant.  The acoustics in the restaurant are not great so everything echoes and having this employee making noise was annoying as hell.  He stopped for a bit then he started up again.  We looked at the dessert menu and the server gave a couple recommendations.  I asked what flavors the gelato was and he said it is a surprise.  But if I had an allergy to let him know. We ordered cookies and cream, server said its a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream.  It was 3 hard chocolate chip cookies with nuts (glad I didn't have a peanut allergy).  It also had chocolate, vanilla and a chocolate chip gelato. The gelato was very good.  The hard over cooked cookies eh, could have done without.  Should have been a warm soft cookie to go with the gelato. While we are eating our dessert, with other customers in the restaurant, the employees are putting the chairs on top of the tables.  Bang, bang, bang.... that employee is sweeping again. He was sweeping around us , I thought he was going to ask for us to put our feet up to clean underneath the table. Dude!?!?! It's loud, do that when your customers leave!!!! We paid the bill and at 9:40, the lights went bright, ok ok we get it, you want us to leave.  I felt like we were in a club at closing time and they turn the lights on to tell people to leave.  4 stars for the pasta dish and gelato and no stars for service, bread and hard cookies.  Learn to give your customers a good experience!

Just had a wonderful lunch at The Herb Box in DC Ranch! The atmosphere is hip, trendy and casual. They had a great looking patio that I'm looking forward to sitting in when it gets a bit cooler. They did have misters out there though so it's tolerable with the heat.   The service was great, no complaints at all.  I had the Turkey Apple Swiss Wrap.  Wow, it was super yummy!   The wrap had bacon bits and cashews in it.  They served the wrap with sweet potato chips.  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but, these chips, I loved.  We couldn't stop there, HAD to have a dessert.  We debated over everything they had and decided on the Lemon Meringue Pie it was very good and is the perfect size to share.  Price was good.  I split the bill with another and total came to $25.

I've been here a couple times before for pedi's and never wrote a review. It had been a good month and a half since I had a pedicure. So needless to say my feet were gnarly.  Called ahead for a 3:30 appointment and got one with no problem.  I'm in love with Angel, my new Pedi Gal!  Angel had just moved here from Wisconsin so being married to a Cheesehead, we had WI in common and plenty to chat about.  Her English was great! Angel fixed my feet and now they are beautiful and I'm happy again to wear sandals out in public.   The pedicure was great had a scrub, a mask and cucumber lotion.  I always ask for designs on my toes and she had tons to choose from.  I love them.

OMG, Let me tell you how happy I am that I found this GEM on Yelp!  Polished Nail is THE BEST!  I can't remember how long I've been going to Polished Nail, it seems like many years.  Every time I walk in the door, I'm always greeted with a warm welcome by the staff and customers.   No offense to the other nail salons out there, this one you will fall in love with.  There is no worry about misunderstanding what you want and no worrying about the staff talking smack about you right in front of your face in a language you don't understand.  English is their first and only language spoken, that I know of... LOL.   Kimberly is my nail magician.  I get the gel set.  I had been to other places and have been in that chair for over 3 hours sometimes and they have looked like crap.  Kimberly gets me in and out in 45 minutes or less and they look AH-Mazing!  I'm in real estate and need to be available when that phone rings so when she gets me done in 30 minutes, it's an added bonus.   I WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE!  Kimberly is awesome.   In regards to one of the reviews, Sherry's didn't make sense to me.  Kimberly is a perfectionist.  She is very skilled and can do a perfect fill quick. Why would someone want to sit in a chair longer than they need to be?  I've never felt rushed by her at all.  $40 for a gel fill is extremely reasonable.  If you're looking to spend more money for a gel fill and more time sitting in the chair, I can recommend a place for you.  Kimberly has always listened and done what I have asked for.   The reviewer said she had a great experience before, where are those great reviews?  Sounds like a Negative Nelly to me.

I'm a big fan of Jimmy Johns. The staff is always friendly.  I love the fact that they deliver.  Get tired of having pizzas delivered.  The drivers are nice and have conversations with you instead of sign this and they're out.  The delivery time is always quick. Less than 20 min.  The place is always clean and all their food is fresh and their bread....awesome!  I like using their mobile app as well.

Had an amazing experience at Eddie V's. It was my 11th Anniversary and I had made a reservation at 8:15 at night. We had been at the ASU football game during the day and the game got out late so I had switched it to 8:45. Well, we got home quicker than I thought so we called and asked if we could come in at our original time which was 8:15 and they were more than willing to accommodate us. We got to the restaurant and our table had a beautiful setting with rose petals and a happy anniversary card signed by the entire staff.  My husband had a caesar salad to start off with and I had the corn crab chowder, both were amazing. When we received both of our steaks, our server asked us to cut into them to make sure they were cooked the right temperature.  My filet was cooked perfectly but my husband was overcooked. So they took the entire order back and gave us a new meal.  Again we had cut into our steaks, my husbands was cooked perfectly but mine was undercooked.  They took back my steak to cook it longer and brought it back and it still was undercooked.  I was fine having it the way it was.  Our server came back and looked at it with her flashlight and asked if it was okay and I told her it was fine she said "you wouldn't tell me anyway would you?"  I told her it was fine which it was and when they took our plates away she told me that they will be taking care of my meal because they couldn't get it cooked right.  Oh I forgot to mention that they gave me the first filet to take home in addition to my undercooked filet.  The manager came by and spoke with us as well and apologized for the steak inconvenience. We told her it was no problem and we were just enjoying the night.  Overall our experience was great we enjoyed the night and to top it off we had the Bananas Foster Cake which is to die for.  We are looking forward to coming back again and again to Eddie V's to enjoy the great food and outstanding service.

This morning was my first time at Arcadia Farms.  The Good: Julia, our server was super sweet.  We got to sit out on the back patio which was full of umbrellas so there was plenty of shade on a beautiful day.  I ordered the French Toast that came with chicken apple sausage, it was decent, but cold as you will see why as you continue reading.  The Not So Good: One of the gals in our party ordered a veggie sandwich off the lunch menu and it was explained to us that she would get her meal a few minutes after the rest of us who ordered breakfast.  I guess if we wanted breakfast we had to order before 11 and after that is when the lunch menu kicks in. So we all gave our order just at 11.  We all received our meals and since the gal who ordered a veggie sandwich was going to get hers a few minutes later, I waited to start eating until she got hers. Well, 10 min went by and nothing, was told it should be any second. 30 minutes went by and she still had not received her VEGGIE sandwich.  I started eating my cold food which I guess is my fault that I waited for the other gal to get her VEGGIE sandwich, was just trying to be polite.  I saw plenty of other people who sat down after 11:00 that got their sandwiches. An hour and 10 minutes went by ....no VEGGIE sandwich.  We called Julia over and told her to cancel the veggie sandwich.  Either the manager overheard it or Julia had told him what was going on cause he finally came by and said he was sorry and that it was coming out.  The gal who ordered it said she didn't want to wait for it. The manager said he would take care of it and get it for her to go.  In addition to this, one of the omelets that came to the table had a long black hair cooked into it.  She sent it back, of course and she got another one.  The manager did not come to the table and talk about the hair omelet and nothing was done with her bill. The Good (cont.): Julia, again, was very sweet and apologetic about the sandwich not coming out.  We kept telling her it was not her fault cause she's not in the kitchen making the food.  She did offer some bread and butter to our foodless friend but she said no thanks. Julia  did bring some "peace offering" scones so she had something to eat. That was very nice of her to do that.  She also was nice enough to do separate checks for 6 of us.   I'm not sure if I will go back.  I really don't know why a veggie sandwich took an hour and 15 minutes. Nothing was grilled or cooked on this. Should not have taken that long.  The hair in the omelet, it happens but it should have been discovered before it got to the table, the hair was smack in the middle on top of the omelet.  If I decide to give them a second try, I do hope Julia is my server.   I'd give 5 stars to Julia and the atmosphere. 1 star for the food and experience.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! I've had the pleasure to visit this oasis tonight for a Yelp event I was lucky enough to be invited by an Elite.   First of all, let me start off by saying my car wash was great my car smells of vanilla (total chick scent). This place is AMAZING.  I am disappointed in myself that I had not been here sooner.  This place is crazy cool.  It has a coffee bar, a bakery, a restaurant with great BBQ, a convenience store, plenty of fancy market items like this homemade butter that one of my friends raves about.  It's a gift store as well.  There were plenty of items I wanted for myself.  Tons of greeting cards for all occasions and for all types of personalities. They've got the sweet birthday cards with pictures of beautiful flowers on them and then they've got the crazy humor birthday cards with 2 old ladies on the front of them talking about the slut in the nursing home, which is my kind of cards I love to give.   They sell wine by the bottle. This is not like the wine selection you see in Circle K. This is the selection you'd see in Cost Plus or AJ's.  The bakery, ohhh the bakery.... Was yummy. They had beautiful cakes you could have custom made. Take a look at the pics I posted. These ladies are talented.  They made cupcakes, cookies, beautiful cakes, chocolates and cinnamon rolls. My friend and I got excited about the cupcakes and she talked to these incredible ladies about custom cupcakes for the Breaking Bad finale.  We encouraged them to sell these cupcakes for the finale.  I will post a picture when we get them. For all you Heisenberg fans, lets just say these cupcakes will be blue.   Looking forward to ordering more themed cupcakes in the future.  Toms Thumb Fresh Market has many areas for you to sit and hang while waiting for your car to get washed or to have a bite or a drink.  I'm looking forward in sitting in the Avaition Chairs that I had seen at Restoration Hardware the week before.... Yeah, the chairs are over $1,500 each! There is nothing bad I can say about this GEM.  I know I' missing tons of other things about this place.  My mind is blown over everything in Tom's Thumb Fresh Market.  I'm just looking forward to go back.

Oh my lord. One lady working the register with 7 people in line.  Love seeing the other employees just staring at the line to check out and don't do anything to help the one who's working. Of course this one that is working is slow as molasses and won't ask for help. 15 minutes just to get a gift card. 2 of the people standing behind me got sick of waiting and left.  As I walked to my car I saw one of the employees strolling in the parking lot.  Come on Ladies, get it together!

Getting back into the whole working out thing. Of course you got to look good while doing it. My first stop was Calvin Klein Performance at the Scottsdale Quarter.  I loved everything they have in there and the prices are reasonable.  Ashley was helping me out with the pants. She was very friendly asking where I have my gym membership and it turns out she goes there too.  Ashley told me about the free yoga classes they offer every Saturday and after you've done the class, they give you a discount in their store that you can use for the day.  She also took my email address to send me info on the sales and upcoming events, etc.  Looking forward to getting into better shape so I can sport those tight pants and shorts.

My first time to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. I enjoyed it overall. They have a great patio. It's a great place for watching a game.  I was there with some gals for Happy Hour and to watch the Cardinals baseball game.  I ordered a margarita. The server, Brittany, said they have a skinny margarita which was fine with me. She brought it to me and this margarita looked dark and brown not the typical yellow/lime and goldish color. I always drink margaritas, there was no chance this was a margarita.  It had no tequila in there, it tasted like there was whisky in it. All the other ladies at the table tasted it and thought the same thing, this was no margarita. I told the server about it, she said it was a pre-made mix.  That's fine with me if it's a pre-made skinny margarita mix, it just needs to have tequila in it.  She was apologetic, I told her it wasn't her fault and she didn't make it. Brittany took it off the bill and I got a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheeseburger off the HH menu and got The Staple Mac n Cheese, both were amazing.  I'm looking forward to going back for great food, amazing service and the fun atmosphere.

I accidentally stumbled across this place while waiting for my table at Over Easy.  I'm sure glad I found this place.  It's located inside the Ice Den.  The prices are just as amazing as their clothes, jewelry and accessories. They always have some special sale going on so you can always save on something cool.   Everything I've purchased there has been complimented multiple times.  I haven't seen their clothes and jewelry anywhere else.  I kinda didn't want to share this boutique with anyone else, keep this place a secret to all my friends, but I can't do that to a great local business.  Each time I go in there is always something new.  Divalicious has a Facebook page and let me just say, it pays to like their posts.  Every now and then, they have a giveaway if you like their posts.  I always give a like and won a reversible bling ring. Check out the pic I posted.  Their Facebook page is always keeping me up to date on all their new merchandise.   You won't be disappointed.

Boondocks is my new favorite hangout.  We were told about this place from a friend.  This place is such a fun, chill place. They had a huge patio which was nice to enjoy it before it gets over 100.  We enjoyed playing corn hole and ping pong. We would have liked to play jenga but there was only one set.  The service was eh, ok. It could have been better.  Our server went at her own pace. Took 35 minutes to get a sprite.  She brought everyone else's drink but mine. I asked (reminded) her for my sprite 2x and eventually got it.  We waited about 10 minutes for our check after asking for it.  They do have a food menu that I will try out next time.  Looking forward to coming back.

Our first time here. This place is very nice and trendy. I will be coming back again with a big group or maybe even for Happy Hour!!  I did come with a group of 8 and we had the big table that was in a private area. It was beautiful.  One of the walls had this long fireplace that was recessed into the wall. Our server Jeff was so sweet and helpful with the menu.  I have not had much experience with this kind of cuisine before and everything I tried was very good and seasoned to perfection.  Started out with the spinach and cheese dip with slices of naan bread. I could have that all the time.   our friends had the hummus and said it was great. I ordered the tandoori flatbread. The tandoori chicken was tender.  I really enjoyed it. I couldn't stop there, I had to have dessert. I ordered the chocolate and vanilla cheesecake. Like the other food I had, the cheesecake was great. All of the food had great presentation.  Oh the wine list was wonderful, it looked like the owner took some time putting that together.  Speaking of the owner, Rupesh, was very nice. He stopped by our table before we all got our meal started and was introduced to our crazy group. Such a gentleman, he pushed in my seat as I sat down.  You won't be disappointed when you come to Inde Fusion.
