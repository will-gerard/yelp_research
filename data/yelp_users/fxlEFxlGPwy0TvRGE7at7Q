Usually I get my brows waxed when I get my hair cut, but the salon I went to last time didn't do brow waxing. So it had been a while and my brows were getting out of hand. I stopped at my usual place without an appointment and was disappointed to discover there was more then an hour wait. I hopped into my car and pulled up Yelp on my phone to find the nearest salon.   Sincerely Yours Salon was the first one that popped up and had great reviews. I called to see if they did waxing and if they had an opening right then. I spoke with Patricia who gathered my information and set the appointment. After giving her my email address, which is tied to my blog, she sounded genuinely interested in knowing more about my blog. We chit chatted until I was a block away.   When I got to the salon, Patricia greeted me like a friend. She introduced me to Tina, who was going to take care of my brows for me. Tina was very friendly and talked with me the whole time I was in the chair. Afterwards, I was given a gift bag with coupons for a free brow wax the next time I came in and 10% off hair products! After having my Redken products confiscated at the airport last week, I was in the market for some new stuff. I didn't care much for the products I had lost, so Tina talked with me about the different products. I was intrigued with one of them, but wasn't sure how it worked. Tina took the extra time to show me how the product worked in my own hair so that I could see how it feels and how to style with it.   I was very impressed with the service I received and my brows look fantastic! I recommend this salon to anybody!

I love that Elevate Coffee Co is a christian based coffee house! The atmosphere is relaxing and homey. Whether you're there to relax and enjoy time with friends or to get homework (or in my case, blogging) done, Elevate has something for everyone. Live music featuring local artists can be heart every Friday and Saturday night.  They have a wide selection of coffees, teas, and smoothies. Elevate also offers pastries and desserts. I even heard they serve breakfast! The baristas are always smiling and ready to serve.  For anybody looking for a local coffee place to hang out, Elevate is the place to be!

Very expensive for what they are. Basically sugar coated sugar. The desserts look delictable, but we ended up throwing away the majority of what we bought. Certainly not worth what I spent.
