So over a week later, we came back. Night and day...... Literally. We went for dinner tonight and everything was absolutely amazing. Everything! It is my husband's birthday and of course he choose Elvira's. The staff was friendly. Not the same staff that was there for Halloween lunch. Our server was so friendly, I wish I had her name so you all could ask for her. (Shoulder length dark hair, glasses, had a huge smile and a perky fun personality. Our busser was so attentive as well, friendly and right on top of everything. He was a young kid. We were so impressed by the way he worked my husband approached him when we left and tipped him out. Very impressed, I hope we continue getting service like we did tonight because we plan on coming back!

Again, another review, another update. This place is not ever consistent, ever. We've gone back quite a few times since the last time I posted. I'm not a reviewer but something about this place caught my eye for the first time, second, third..... So I had to whether experience be good or bad.  I still wish I knew this fabulous servers name, the only time we have ever had an enjoyable time (twice) and even another when we we sitting in bar, forgot about by our server this lady, my only favorite came by to say hi & quickly grabbed boxes, cleared empty plates and said let me get you some refills. Short brown hair, glasses and a huge smile. The name Elaine sounds familiar but I honestly just can't remember. But owners needs to put this lady in charge. Very attentive, knows what she's doing and puts smiles on everyone's face. Seriously.  It's sad, this place has so much good quality, the food is fabulous you guys can do better but they need someone in charge. Not the young girls up front that are solving all the issues, taking-wrapping to go's (for 20 minutes & still come out wrong) , answering phones, seating.... Etc. Not these girls, it's a shame to not see this place poppin like it should be. Straighten up the service. I'm not sure after Sunday nights to go experience, we'll even waste our time coming back Here unless I see that lady (maybe Elaine) & know she'll be waiting on us.

Wow, you helpers weren't kidding. This place is amazing. We ordered 5 dinners the other day and the amount of food they provided, were huge. Not one negative thing I could say. Staff was so kind and friendly and we have a new favorite place.
