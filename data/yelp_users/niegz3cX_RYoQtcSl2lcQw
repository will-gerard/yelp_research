I have been going here for about 6 months and absolutely love it. They always do a wonderful job and take their time to make sure you are happy.

I come to Oreganos often but was very displeased with the communication and management. We came on Father's Day for just dessert and was told it would be a 30 min wait (which is fine). We were then told by the hostess we would only have to wait the same amount for a to go order. So we took our name off the list and went to order to go only to find out that we would have to wait over an hour. When we went back to the hostess she said it was now a 45 minute wait and we would need to add our name to the list again.  As much as we love oreganos, it is frustrating that there was no communication and we left hungry and upset.
