Food was great!! Customer service too. I was a little disappointed that the fried wontons were just chips. They usually have meat in them, but I still at them all. Sesame chicken and kungpao shrimp were awesome. Huge servings!!

Chris the waiter and Chris the bartender are amazing. They are quick, friendly and very attentive. The food is awesome. I love the Fajitas. Very good size portion, I recommend the steak and shrimp. Drinks are awesome as well. They have a very good selection. Providing free poker on Monday nights is also really cool!!

Soooooo rude!!! I ordered a photo print on the app.. Got my order confirmation email, and the email stating that the order was ready. I drive all the way down there to pick it up. Not there. The sales person would not even offer any kind of help. In fact when I told her I had an email confirmation saying the photo was ready and here at the location, her response was "I don't know what to tell you, it's not here!" I was shocked. That is the rudest customer service I have ever encountered... Now a photo that was supposed to be a gift, is not there, and I am left without a gift, and apparently "I" need to make another arrangements. Why would I try to order it again, since the first time went so well?? I can understand that stuff happens and perhaps there was a mistake, but she did not offer any kind of help or solution. She should be fired!!!!

So don't go to this place... I had a unexpected gap in my day. Sat at the bar by myself to order a salad.. Asked for a glass of water to start after asking for the menu.. Then was ignored completely the rest of the time. While people on both sides of me sat down after, was asked for drink and food orders, received food n drink orders, and enjoyed food and drink orders. All while still no one acknowledging me and asking if I would like to even place an order or if I had any questions! Seriously disappointed!! It's already not easy going out and dining alone, but then being ignored just makes it worse!! I wanted to order the quinoa chopped salad and a few glasses of wine. At least the bartender got a $1 from me for my glass of water. What she had against me, I do not know. But it wasn't personal, because there were 2 bartenders , and they both ignored me!!! Not going again.. Which is sad, because I take yoga right next door, and am there all the time. Just don't go alone I guess!!
