If you want professional work from an expert esthetician, make an appointment with Ginger Lee. She's thorough and discreet. She provides an array of services including full body waxing. As waxing goes, it's somehow far less painful with Ginger. She has a way of distracting you in at the most strategic moments! LOL

Ms. Lisa Stevens is a makeup artist at Salon Surreal. I'm a film and television actor in Phoenix and Los Angeles. Lisa has done my makeup a few times and I've been very pleased. Recently, however, I asked Lisa about permanent makeup as I have a difficult time applying eye liner. Lisa did an amazing job on my upper eye lids! I can't speak highly enough of her work!!

Thank God this place went out of business! I went in there one day and chatted up the owner a bit before ordering. It was about 3 in the afternoon and no other customers were around. I asked if I could get a half sandwich and the owner rudely asked what I expected him to do with the other half! Is he THAT stupid or just a smartass!

Pino Martino owner of Pino's Pizza al Centro, immigrated to Phoenix from Basilicata, Italy approximately 30 years ago.   Pino's specializes in Italian and New York pies with their signature thin crust. He also offers delicious specialty pizzas. Pizza is available by the pie or by the slice. It's the perfect spot for lunch or dinner. If you prefer an authentic calzone, Pino's is the place to get one. In all his dishes, Chef Martino uses only the best and freshest ingredients. He makes his own sausage and never uses the likes of canned tomato sauce or puree.  If you prefer a sandwich or a salad, you'll find a nice variety to choose from. I especially like the caprese made of fresh mozzarella and basil. The thought of the Italiano panini made with Pino's home made Italian dressing and imported prosciutto, makes my mouth water.  Chef Martino, himself, is always in the kitchen. If you go when it's not meal time, he might even have a moment to stop by your table and tell you some true tales of Italy.   I LOVE Pinos!

Yesterday, (16 June 2013) my son visited Rosie McCaffrey's. He ordered a hamburger and a small pitcher of beer. When he attempted to pay, his debit card was declined. He asked me to go by and take care of the bill. Upon my arrival, (16 June 2013, 1800hrs.) I spoke with bartender "Sam" who refused to take my debit card stating she had paid cash out of her pocket. She was unable to explain why she couldn't use my card and take cash from the register. I told her I'd write her a check then because I had no cash. She refused a check!! Eventually, Sam told me there was an ATM outside. I obtained cash from the ATM and returned to pay the bill of $14.08. Then, Sam refused to give me a receipt for the $20.00 I gave her ($14.08 plus tip). At the end of our visit she gave me my son's debit card and driver's license without even knowing who I was!!! Needless to say, no one in our family will be visiting Rosie McCaffrey's again.

Quin Adams has the most desirable quality in a professional - honesty! I put a dent in my Sebring on the LR fender between the tail light and the gas cap. The body shop estimated between $1000-1500 for the replacement of the quarter panel. Quin came to my house. He said the repair was too extensive to do on site and could I bring it to his shop. Once there, Quin explained the proper way to do the repair would be to replace the quarter panel but he would try to knock out the dent and at least make it look better. Well!! When the job was finished, two hours later, I could barely tell any damage had been there. The cost? $225.

I don't see a single "negative" review.  zPizza is the best gluten-free option in the Phoenix metro area!! It's a small family owned business in the heart of Central Phoenix. If you don't live close, come anyway. The food and service is worth the drive! While you're there, try a dessert at the Pink Spot next door. Yummy!

Terminix responded to our call the next day. We've been customers for several years and usually don't need an additional service call. But, the great thing is we can request as many service calls as we want at no extra charge. Furthermore, technicians are not commissioned. This adds an extra layer of trust.

I love this place! For the past 3 years, I have been frequenting the Line Thai Restaurant even though it's quite a drive for me. The food is outstanding and the service is friendly and accommodating. I've brought guests in the past who are on special medical diets. The chefs are more than happy to cook to order. To add to it all, the atmosphere is quiet and the seating is spacious. If you like Thai food, check out the Line Thai, for sure!!

I, so LOVE Pizza A Metro. It's kind of a misnomer because their's is a complete Italian menu. The pastas are wonderful, the wine is good, and the service is friendly. This is a very classy place in a very dodgey location. But, don't be fooled by the neighborhood. Pizza a Metro is the best place in the city for Italian food!

Topher Lewis is arguably  the best stylist in Phoenix. Currently, he rents his space at Salon 7. Topher works on prominent sets in the Hollywood, CA market, but visits the Valley of the Sun, monthly, to keep his local clients in good shape. As a local Phoenix actor, I have to be in top shape at the drop of a hat. When it comes to my hair, I trust only Topher with the task.

In this world of scams, you can really trust Amanda Melby and her instructors when it comes to acting. Most other private acting schools operating in the state of Arizona, are about making money. Some of them won't even tell you they're a school. They promote themselves as, "middlemen" between the actor and the agent. Additionally, they target their marketing toward parents with hopeful children. Why? Because they are about making money. Verve Studio is definitely the antithesis. The courses of study offered here, are for the serious performer.

At Verve Studio, I learn and grow in a friendly, nurturing, and sensitive environment where I'm free to experiment with technique. I love my coaches and fellow students. The Scene Study is the only on-going course of study of it's type that I know of in the Phoenix area.

We showed up an hour after Beckett's Table closed on Mother's Day due to a misunderstanding in our reservation. We were graciously welcomed in anyway. Seven chefs, the bartender, waitress and hostess stayed until we finished eating our fabulous food.

BEWARE!!!  The refundable $200 credit check fee will not actually be refunded. It IS a  fee. I'm having to sue them in small claims court to get my money back.

My first stop here was a very pleasant trip. The food is fantastic!  But, additionally the staff was welcoming and couldn't do enough to make sure we were happy. Thank you, The Wing Counter, for the food and the hospitality!

Best Chicago pizza in Illinois and now the best in the West! Malnati's deep dish pizza is one of the things that make me homesick for Chicago. But, now I can get it in Phoenix - delivered! I LOVE that fresh mozzarella cheese.
