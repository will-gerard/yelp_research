Great donuts.  I think they are just a slight step below BoSa, but they are very good.

Got a pair of pants hemmed.  Nothing special, just a normal hem on a normal pair of pants.  I didn't even think to ask how much it would cost.  $18.  I guess since they're in desert ridge they feel they can charge whatever they want.  I won't be going here again, for alterations or dry cleaning.

What's that you say? You have a propane tank that's empty and you don't know what to do with it?   I was in that boat, and was trying to decide where I should go swap my empty tank for a full one. I priced out the typical Blue Rhino swap places and it looked like it would cost me up to $30 for a refilled tank.   Doing some research, I found a list of propane service companies, called up Arizona Propane, and they confirmed they would refill my tank while I wait.   This part of McKellips Road always makes me laugh...3 miles from Scottsdale, 3 miles from Mesa, and yet whenever I'm on it I feel like I'm lost on a back road in West Texas. But the lot wasn't hard to find. I drove up to what looked like an old-time gas pump, the guy filled my tank for less than $15 and I drove away a happy camper, er, barbecuer.   How easy was that?

Stopped on the way to Payson.  I was hoping for a good traditional down-home breakfast. What I got was denny's quality

Went for lunch and had the chicken chimi with green enchilada sauce.  It tasted great.  I liked the chips and both the green salsa (mildly spicy) and the red salsa (spicy).  Prices were reasonable for what I expected, especially the lunch specials.

I went in, had an original wineburger with grilled onions, american cheese, and a fried egg.  The burger came out piping hot...I actually had to wait a minute to eat it.  That's a good sign.  The burger was very charcoal-y which I thought added to the flavor.  But if you like yours very rare, make sure you ask them to make it that way.  The buns are soft but don't crumble under your grasp...again, a good sign.  It's all-in-all a really good burger.  I also had the onion scoops.  Spicy and good.  Beer selection was o.k., sort of odd, but I had a couple of Deep Canyon Ambers which were good, in frosty schooners (maybe 16 oz?).  Unique atmosphere, feels very "local".  I'll be back, it's a nice place to meet up with a couple of people for some good burgers and beer.

Stopped by for a late lunch and had just the gyro sandwich.  Really good...the pita was stuffed with flavorful meat, nice and moist.  I'll be by again, have to try some other items on the menu.

Best donuts in the valley.  I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh.

Mesa Arts Center is a treasure.  Consistently the best performing arts center in the Phoenix Metro area.  As a member the last 4 or 5 years, I've seen 30+ shows, and I always enjoy the facilities.  The Ikeda theater is one of the most beautiful I've ever been in and is in a completely different class than, say, Scottsdale or Chandler's centers for the arts.  (note:  I haven't yet been to the Tempe Center for the Performing Arts).

I've been going to Brown Road for four years, since I rescued two Golden Retrievers.  Through all of the everyday (vaccinations, etc.) and complex (Cushing's disease) issues my dogs have had, BRAC has been warm, supportive and understanding.  My dogs actually enjoy going to the vet, because they receive genuine attention and affection from the staff.  The two vets have differing styles...I like Dr. McNulty more than Dr. Atkins, but I have friends who have had the opposite reaction.  If you go and don't make a connection to one of the vets, you can ask for your next appt to be with the other.  I have recently become more financially limited, and they have been sensitive to that, offering me alternatives to a recent issue we are dealing with.

Pancakes are very good, the rest of the breakfast items are average at best.  There is always a wait. On the weekend the length of wait is beyond reasonable (1 hour +).  Accepting only cash is not reasonable for a chain restaurant.  Not allowing you to bring drinks from outside is also not reasonable, especially considering the wait time (isn't it o.k. for me to drink my latte while I wait?)

I've been twice now.  Both times the food quality was just average.  I dock an additional star for being overpriced.  The basil crispy chicken just didn't work for me.  Maybe it's their execution, but the "flash frying" of the basil just creates a bitter flavor that ruins the dish.  The pad thai was very average.  I know it's not an adventurous thai dish, but I had a hankering for it and was disappointed that it wasn't better.  I do like the atmosphere, and the service was solid.  I liked Phuket, a beer I don't remember having had before.  The tables on the sidewalk are dog-friendly.

I had used Prestige Car Wash off and on for a few years, never really that impressed, but I put up with the tiresome upsell and offer to fix windshield chips.  A while back I decided to get a full detail of my car, inside and out.  Unfortunately, I was told they were all booked up for the afternoon, but if I bought a gift certificate for a detail they would wash my car today and  I could schedule the detail anytime.  Seemed fair enough so I paid $150, got my free basic wash and my gift certificate, and went on my way.  Yesterday I called to schedule the detail and the manager said no problem, bring it in any time.  I told them I wanted a detail they said no problem, talk to the cashier.  When I showed the cashier my gift certificate she indicated they don't accept gift certificates anymore.  I show her that the certificate shows I paid $150, it has no expiration date, and that I couldn't believe they weren't going to give me anything for the $150 I paid them.  She indicated that the manager who gave me that card "wasn't putting the money into the cash register" and has been fired so they couldn't honor the gift certificate.  Next call will be to one of the "3 on your side" type of folks, followed by setting up a court date in small claims court to get my $150 back.  If you want to avoid this kind of hassle, I suggest you skip Prestige and go to one of the many other choices you have for auto wash and detailing.

I've been trying various cheap mexican food "stands" in an effort to find something that resembles what you find in San Diego.  Fiesta Burrito is the best I've found in the valley.  (note: Los Favoritos is up there with it)  I've had mostly burritos and rolled tacos, but I've really liked them.  Carne Asada, bean-and-cheese, and breakfast burritos have all been very solid.  I like the rolled tacos, as well.  My companion on a recent visit ordered the "rolled tacos supreme" (where they pile carne asada and other stuff on top of 5 rolled tacos).  Wow, I'd never noticed that before...can I try one?  In a word, awesome.  Not very practical to eat, but really yummy.  Although I expect (and accept) a little tummy-turning after a meal at a place like this, I've never had even the slightest grumble after eating at Fiesta.  It's cheap and they DO accept credit cards.

Nice facility.  However the batting cages are truly the worst I've ever used.  I've been twice now.  No matter which cages I use, the machine is extremely inconsistent.  Out of your 14 balls per token, expect to get 3 or 4 "strikes" and the rest unhittable.  I like that they have multiple slow-pitch softball machines, but I feel like practicing on these machines is more likely to mess up my swing than improve it.  Too bad, because the location is great and the rest of Kiwanis Park seems cool.

I've been a handful of times now.  All I've had is the pizza, but I've had most of the menu (not difficult with only 6 choices).  The last time I went my friends added additional items which didn't improve their pizzas.  The positives -- good crust and fresh organic ingredients  The negatives -- poor pizza design, poor execution, long lines  One bit of good news is that Pizzeria Bianco is now open for lunch.  The last two times I've eaten here there was no line; both were afternoon meals.  The lines are still long in the evenings.  I like the crust, as overly thin and slightly burnt as it might be.  And I appreciate the organic ingredients.  But they just don't taste very good.  The Margherita and Biancoverde, two pizza styles I normally love, are just kind of boring.  Supplemental ingredients (expensive to add and the restaurant actually adds too much of them to your pizza) don't help.  The Sonny Boy has sort of a sharp olivey flavor which isn't desirable, and the Wiseguy pizza is less than the sum of its parts.  But in addition to the flawed pizza design, I've experienced inconsistency in the pizzas I've had.  The same pizza can taste substantially different on different visits.  Some might argue something about each pizza being unique because they are made by hand, but my experience is that it is simply poor execution.  One last item.  This didn't contribute to the review, but is worth noting.  This has to be the worst pizza I've ever had "the next day".  Whether eaten cold or reheated (something I do with a lot of pizza), it is borderline inedible.  Not a requirement for a good pizza place, bur don't over-order because your take home portions will just go into the trash.

The Gelato Spot is an image first, quality second, type of business.   They've got the wink-wink name, the stores have a glossy look, and have you seen their take-out bags?  Fancy!  Unfortunately, the quality of the gelato is average.  For better quality gelato go to Angel Sweet or Dolce Vita.  The prices at Gelato Spot are the most expensive in the valley.  10.99 for a pint to go is just absurd.  Expensive, average quality...but at least you can buy it in the same Biltmore-area-don't-call-it -a-strip-mall as the overated Delux and Revo Burrito.

I've been to Matt's a couple of times now.  There is always a line.  Most recently I went on a Wednesday, which they will tell you is the slowest day,  and the line was shorter that day.  Matt's is small, not in a quaint way, but in a cramped way.  I sat at the counter.  It's impossible to sit comfortably at their counter, because of the lack of leg room, but the other problem is that  they have put one too many chairs at the counter, so I was bumping elbows throughout my meal with my neighbors.  If you go by yourself, they won't let you sit at a table, so you're stuck at their crappy counter.  (don't get me wrong...I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant, as you get better and faster service)  One of my meals, the AZ scramble (a special) was pretty solid.  And I like the rosemary homefries.  Other meals (including the salami and eggs) weren't that remarkable.  Matt's won't be my first, second, third choice for breakfast in the valley.  Too much trouble for inconsistent results.  If I want to wait in a line I'll go to Morning Glory Cafe, where the atmosphere is SO much better and the food is better.  If I don't want to wait in a line, there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait.

I've been going to US Egg for about five years, and over that time the food has remained consistently great.  Their menu is large and is a good mix of the healthy and the, well, less healthy.  The protein pancakes are their signature dish, and although I'm not sure I believe the low "net carbs" they describe on the menu, they are still really tasty and very unique.  I've had a variety of omelettes and scrambles here and I really like them all.  But most of the time I order the half-and-half which is a plate of a smaller portion of protein pancakes and a dish of their homefries mixed with veggies meats or cheese (there are a couple of options) with an egg on top.  I always have them add a second egg to get the egg-meat-cheese-potato balance just right.  It can be crowded on the weekend, especially during spring training and typical busy tourist times.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are big.

Bak'd appears to have closed it's doors as a restaurant.  Have been many times before, and have always had great food and service.  We tried to make a reservation for next week and were informed of the sad news.  They only do catering now.

I've now been to this location 3 times.  I had previously visited the locations and really enjoyed my meals.  Unfortunately, something seems to be missing here at the "downtown" location.  The service has been haphazard each time I've gone.  The waitstaff rushes around as if they are swamped even when they're just half full.  One trip we experienced a long wait for a table, though it looked like all that was required was to bus the table of some previously departed customers.  The food is a shadow of the meals I've had a the other locations.  Not a horrible version, but nothing that stands out from the myriad of mexican restaurants available here in Phoenix.  One trip we had a pitcher of blended margaritas, which tasted watery and bland.  So the next time we ordered individual margaritas, over rocks.  Unfortunately, they too were bland.

This is my favorite breakfast place in the valley.  I used to go to the Scottsdale location more, but now I generally go to this location, because it is DOG FRIENDLY!  Yay!  The food is of the same consistent quality of the Scottsdale restaurant.  Same menu, same great protein pancakes, etc.  I recommend the half-and-half (see further description in my review of the Scottsdale location)  I don't find this one to be as busy as the Scottsdale location, but there can be a wait on weekends.  But I've found the servers and ownership to be very helpful, in particular when we have brought dogs.  Because this locaiton is dog friendly, it gets an extra star pushing it to 5 stars!

Had the Basic breakfast.  The ham really is great, as were the pancakes instead of toast.  Because of the good biscuits and gravy reviews, I ordered a 1/2 order on the side and was impressed.  I rarely like restaurant gravy (never meaty enough for my taste), and this gravy was really good.  Service was outstanding, they just seemed to go out of their way to make sure everything was o.k.  and seemed genuinely interested in making sure I had a great breakfast experience.  Patio is dog-friendly.

Big portions, but expensive for what you're getting.  I was using a groupon so I didn't feel so bad.  There was no line and they were working on just one other order, but it did take longer than I expected.  Not a horrible wait, but I'm not sure how they'd manage if it were crowded.  Ordered the Navajo taco with Green Chili and a Frybread with powdered sugar, to go.  I opened up my taco to discover lots of fresh shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, but no green chili.  Needless to say I was disappointed.  The flavor of the taco with just the pinto beans and veggies was pretty good, but I was really looking for some meat.  The "dessert" frybread was good, but after a couple of bites it seems like a bit much.  I wish they made their desserts in smaller portions for a cheaper price.  I'll probably be back to see if the mistaken order was a one-time issue, but I won't be rushing back.  Maybe if I get another Groupon I'll be back.

You might see from my other reviews that I have long thought BoSa has the best donuts in the valley.  Well, I have tried Lamar's, and I think their donuts might be a little better.  The donuts at Lamar's are fresh and light and tasty.  The reviews indicated the selection is limited late morning,  but at 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday they appeared to have just about everything in stock.  They keep primarily to the standards, for good reason.  They just make really good donuts.  Their one location in the NW valley isn't as convenient for me as BoSa's two locations, and they might be just a little more expensive.  But I vote their taste and selection just a little better.  So they get a 5-start rating, the same as BoSa.  If you go to either of these donut shops you won't be disappointed.

Good "upscale" mexican fast food, if that makes any sense.  Lots of great flavors to be had.  Mixing and matching with the unique salsas (peanut, pecan, cilantro and jicama salsas are standouts) allows for some pretty awesome flavor combinations.  Sort of an odd place, because it the menu feels like it should be a takeout or order-and-take your seat kind of place, but it has a beautiful wood bar that seems wasted on the environment.  If they do carry beer, it isn't in an obvious place (no taps, no display refridgerator).  And they appear to only carry one type of wine.  Just think of the drinks as afterthoughts and enjoy the variety of food you are able to enjoy...

I got to see a show at the Music Theater inside the MIM.  What a treat!  The theatre is beautiful, and the acoustics are amazing.  It reminds me a lot of the Ikeda Theatre at Mesa Arts Center, but it's a bit more intimate (500 seats instead of 1,600).  I haven't been to the museum itself, but I'm hoping to come back soon to check it out as well.  The design of the grounds and buildings is really beautiful.

My girlfriend took her Hyundai to get serviced at Chapman.  She's not real knowledgable and they took advantage.  They told her she was due to replace the engine air filter.  In fact, her manual indicated that it needn't be replaced for another 10,000 miles.  She had a separate question on the bill, which she was told she had to discuss with the service representative.  She waited for 20 additional minutes, and after that time the service rep still didn't make himself available to her.  She ended up just having to accept the bill as is, because she had an appointment she had to make.  I wouldn't recommend this place.  Even if you are knowledgable about your car, why should you have to second guess your mechanic on basic repairs?

These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.  I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.

I went back for lunch and really enjoyed Villa Peru.  It was two of us, and we each ordered an entree ($11 each).  A few dollars more than I'd typically spend for lunch but I was hungry and the entrees just looked tasty.  They also have some panini/sandwiches which are in my normal lunch price range.  I ordered the Bistec a la Pobre.  The food was really good, from the bread with dipping sauce they start you with to the meal itself.  The portions were good-sized, as I'd expect with an entree.  The waitress was very friendly -- attentive without being pushy.  Our food came out timely.  I'll go again...I'm interested in seeing if I like their sandwiches as much as their entrees.

Had a Chicago Dog with cheese and an Italian Beef (wet).  Both were really good.  The Italian Beef had great flavor but next time I might ask if they can add cheese to it.  Also had an order of cheese fries which were good...would be "great" if the fries were crispy.  Will stop by again when going through Fountain Hills.  Easy to get to, right on Shea Blvd.

I probably never would have tried Fu Fu Cuisine without the groupon ($15 for $30), but now that I've tried it I will go back (groupon or not).  We got the Yassa Tilapia and the Jerk Chicken.  Both were very good.  Other reviews have said it, and it's true.  Each dish tastes distinctly different and each has a combination of flavors that really make the dishes "pop".  Even the rice with the Jerk chicken was unique and complex.  We started with a meat pie, which tasted like a hanheld pot pie.  The meat stuffing has a little spice to it.  The Pof-pofs are good, one per person makes for a good additional starter.  Their all-bottle beer selection isn't bad (includes Corona, Guinness, and Heineken, including other american and caribbean favorites), which are all $3.50.  Very reasonable.

Rock and Roll Patio had opened only a few days before I visited, and it exhibited some of that soft opening awkwardness I expected.  But there's a lot to like about R&RP.  Their menu is pretty abbreviated...a few hamburgers, corndog, and rice bowls.  They mentioned something about trying out new items, so I'm guessing the menu will expand at some point  The restaurant appears to be operated and staffed by the owners.  The Rock and Roll theme seems a little odd, but this isn't a place I would go to for the theme, anyhow.  The patio is cute, although it does feel a bit "exposed" right on the very busy 7th Street.  But let's get to the food.  The mushroom burger was very tasty, with great fresh ingredients.  The buns are really good, and the burger cooked just right.  The fries, which the owner mentioned he cuts fresh every morning, were good, more for the seasoning than the fries themselves.  They didn't come out as crispy as I like, but the potato flavor you get from fresh potatoes is definitely present.  I also tried a corndog, which tasted good.  It's hard to make a corndog anything truly special, but the dog tasted like a good beef dog, and the "corn" tasted right.  Prices are very reasonable, $5.00 gets you a good sized hamburger with fries.  I'll go to R&R Patio again when I'm in the mood for a fast-food burger prepared with local care and fresh ingredients.

Small burger, Small fry, Small drink = $10  Burger -- Tomato and Lettuce were fresh and good.  Bun "collapsed" and became that gooey fake white bread bun that you can see where your hand grabbed the burger.  The patty/cheese was fine, I guess...but I didn't get any real flavor from it.  Fries -- They use "real" potatoes, but the fries are flavorless.  But at least they're greasy!  Soda -- Kudos for a good selection, including two diet-caffeine-free choices, something I've never seen before!  I'm not a fanboy of In-n-Out, but at least they know to charge a reasonable price for their food (which is much better than Five Guys).  In summary...this place is the emperor with no clothes.  And they want you to know that lots of newspapers around the country think they're great...the reviews are all over the walls.  Perhaps they're trying to convince patrons that their tastebuds and pocketbook are lying...

Just o.k.  It has a pretty weird vibe.  Good beer served by ill-informed school kids.  I ordered the beer of the month, Full Sail Session.  Came in a 11 oz bottle.  Which, when poured into one of their "pint" glasses, nearly filled the glass.  So, that "pint" you order is really a 12 oz glass.  Stay classy, Mill Ave.  I'll stick to Boulders on Broadway or Taste of Tops when I want a good beer in Tempe.

Since my review, I've been informed that WoB has different glassware for different pours.  So the specific glass I was served in was a 12-oz glass, intended for cans or bottles, not their normal pint glass.  I haven't confirmed this, but it seems reasonable, so I stand corrected.  However, I will take this chance to comment on the fact that the prices at WoB start at $5.00 per pint, which although not unreasonable (especially for Mill Ave), can be improved upon at many other craft-beer specialty bars in the area.  (On the day I was at WoB, I had a Deschutes Green Lakes Organic Ale pint for $3.50 at Boulders on Broadway).  And one last thing that annoyed me that I didn't note in my original review was the "shot" of beer I had.  The menu mentions that shots of beer (what is known as "samplers" in most every other craft brew bar or brewpub) are $2-$5 (charging $5 for any shot makes no sense at all).  I had a beer that costs $6.00 per pint and I was charged $3 for a "shot" of the beer.  This is completely unreasonable.  I recommend that if you decide to go with "shots" of beer, stick with only the cheapest beers on the menu, so you pay only $2 per shot.  These issues, in addition to the strange vibe and the ill-informed wait staff, keep my review at 2 stars.  There is simply MUCH better options to sample good craft beer in Tempe (e.g., Boulders, Taste of Tops)
