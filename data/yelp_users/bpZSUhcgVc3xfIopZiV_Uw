Worst experience ever, brought my daughter here for her birthday and food was burnt and it took 35min to get a refill after the server told me 2 times he was gonna go get it. Manager tried to make it right but failed, still got charged for a burnt meal. This place is ridiculous. Never again

One of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix, in my personal opinion. And they deliver! The food quality is very good and great customer service. I would definitely recommend. Keep up the good work
