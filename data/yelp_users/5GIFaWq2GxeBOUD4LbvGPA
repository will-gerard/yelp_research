Enjoyed the Suns VS Bucks last night! Great game even if Suns lost the last 3.5 seconds of the game. Bummed.

This place is delicious!! Complimentary valet parking. Whoot!! Came here for an early date night dinner and ordered some of their baked wings for an appetizer.. I don't like BBQ and these wings had some homemade BBQ sauce with some hot sauce. Which I clearly didn't see in the menu. So when they arrived I could literally smell the BBQ on them so I asked the waitress and she told me it was mixed in I told her I don't eat BBQ and she kindly took them back and brought some hot baked wings instead. The wings were good but in some areas they were burnt and i didn't like that taste but my BF did. Lol the wings also didn't have much sauce but the waitress brought us extra without asking. Score!  Our pizza... Was delicious! It's a must try. The crust is just right ugh mouthwatering. Definitely will come back.

Great service! Great food! First time having chicken and waffles during the same meal. The waffles are super uber mouthwatering delicious. Waffles are crunchy and soft all in one. The chicken was crispy and very flavorful just how I like it! Not only was the experience amazing, but the atmosphere was great. Great music playing but also not too loud, which was great for my brunch date and I. Not only was all this amazing but also had valet parking. So many thumbs up for this place!

First time coming here. Easy to find. The waitress was very helpful, kind, full of energy and great customer service which was great.    I didn't know what I felt like eating so she was kind enough to tell me what the most ordered as well as best tasting meals where. She was very descriptive. Food arrived within 10-15 mins and everything was fresh and wonderful. Definitely coming back soon.

Their service is terrible! Took 15 mins just to get our drinks. And had to call the waitress to get our check. She didn't even realize that we already had our food. And another 15 mins just to get our check. Then she disappeared

Tiffany, Tiffany.. It's just a sin to come here. I love their jewelry selection. Wish I could have it all ugh. Every time I come here I just want to buy everything, but then there will be no room for gifts lol as I walk in I am immediately greeted by an employee love feeling acknowledge. Only came for a cleaning and they were very kind. I usually purchase online but needed to have some jewelry cleaned and as soon as I told the employee there she kindly walked me to customer service area where they have these amazing comfortable chairs wish I could just stay here all day. Lol can't wait for the next time I come. Next time will definitely be a purchase lol

Where to start?! This place is AMAZING! The staff is friendly, very welcoming, the set up is romantic and very beautiful. Came to celebrate my BFs bday and the staff provided us with a complimentary dessert and the staff signed a congratulations card. My entree was the salmon. Where do I start. It was crunchy but yet so soft. My BF had the serlion. He said it was amazing. One of the best he has ever had. The view on the patio was spectacular. And we had a musician. Our table was right next to the water fountain. Overall speechless for a great night! Must try the truffle fries!

I love Scottsdale Fashion Square. It's just such a far drive for me! But I do love all the stores. It's sooooo huge! All different price range stores from Louis Vuitton, prada, Tory burch, Michael Kors, Zara, Tiffany and co etc! Definitely nice place to visit when you are in town

I loved this place! Came for a little romantic dinner with my love right before enjoying the Suns basketball game. We had a wonderful walk to this place. It was a very romantic scenery. The view was lovely, the food was delicious. New great memories for him and I.  The pizza was jus wonderful very filling for the both of us. First thing I thought of was artichoke on pizza? Eh idk. But that was my fav! Definitely coming back for more. Thank you for the lovely staff and for the musician playing romantic songs during our dinner it was just lovely all the way around.

I love this place!!! Hate waiting in line for a movie hate having to look for a good seat because they are always taken... But this place.. I love how it os just s few seats so you don't have to worry about other being too loud or having to worry about where to sit. Just buy your tickets online and you get to pick where you sit and the best part bout it is that they are reserved! I love going to the 21 and over, their seats are so comfy and so huge you can literally lay on the couch! It's like being at home and having s waiter! YES!!!

Amazing! Delicious! Came to have breakfast for the hubby's birthday celebration. The service was great! Servers always very attentive. By far one of the greatest places I have ever been to for breakfast. Definitely beats IHOP. Even though it was pretty full we did not have to wait long for our food! Definitely wonderful!

Got a referral for some lab work from my physician and they suggested this new company which so happens to be inside Walgreens. Let's start of by saying I didn't have to wait, they took me in really quickly. I must have been in there maybe 10 mins. The blood was quick and painless. It was amazing!!! And u can check ur blood work results within 24-48 hours through an APP?!? Technology! How great is that! Super convenient

Where to start... Food was terrible! I ordered the bacon avocado omelette which comes with potatoes. I ordered a side of turkey sausage links with toast and blueberry muffin.  The omelette had no flavor, it was plain and with literally 2 pieces of avocado. There was not enough bacon or avocado or tomatoes in the omelette. I basically was just eating 3 eggs. The cheese was disgusting.  My niece ordered the bacon and turkey crepes with potatoes. The crepes had mushrooms which we clearly stated to the waitress no mushrooms so she had to take back and remake. My niece hated the crepes. She said it was not what she expected. No flavor whatsoever on both meals. The freshly made blueberry muffin tasted too much like dough. I think they changed cooks because the first time k tried it all the food was delicious and full with flavor. Definitely won't be coming back. :(   $40 to only like the sausage links. The toast was burnt :(

5 stars after 1 star at a previous location. I went in already disappointed thinking my service was going to be terrible like before at a different location. Food was great, fast and what can I say definitely a 5 star for the awesome customer service. My waitress was amazing. She was always checking make sure we had everything we needed. Didn't make us wait for long on anything. She was very talkative, her recommendations were great. She was jus plain amazing! Thank you Marissa for a wonderful experience!

This morning for breakfast my hubby and I were in the mood for French toast decided we should definitely come here. When we arrived we were immediately greeted and were sat right away. Server came by and was ready to take our order. The hubby ordered the strawberry and banana French toast without the white filling and I ordered a skillet with eggs, ham, sausage , bacon, veggies, potatoes and it came with an order of pancakes. By far one of the best places to have breakfast. The pancakes were delicious. And the best part is we literally had our meal within 10 min of ordering. Every time we come it is never a disappointment.

Poor customer service! I was told 15 minutes for my personal pizza, it has been 30 minutes and still nothing. I remember why I do not come here. The wait is too much. Best to place an order literally an hour before you get hungry. Let's hope this is worth the wait.

Loved the service here! Customer service was superb. Arrived about 30 minutes before they closed and got a pedi done. A much needed one. The person that did mine did it in no rush! Had a great massage. He took his time. And removed the calluses! Yay! Clean soft feet again! Definitely will come back

I love the vibe!! Way better than sky lounge. It's a little cafe with different reggae, hip hop, r&b music! Bartender was too packed though. Took a while to order our drinks. But the vibe and the music was amazing tonight. One of our friends dad was DJng tonight and he did a superb job!

Second breakfast date today, same waiter, Robert. No matter how busy he is running around he is always so very attentive! I love it! Tried their Gouda omelette which I did not like because of the Gouda cheese. Switched breakfast with my boyfriend and he loved it lol but then again he loves to eat! Haha

Love this place! They have the best, freshest donuts in the valley. It reminds me of California. These donuts are made fresh. Love coming in as soon as they open. The owners are always so friendly and welcoming. I only come here. The owners already know my order which is even more amazing. This place also has boba! Which is also soooo amazing! Mouthwatering deliciousness

Where to start.. The service was rather quick, and the waitress super welcoming. The food came out really quick. But let's just say food had no flavor. The omelette tasted bland, the potatoes was the only thing I liked on my plate and that's after adding pepper, salt, ketchup and hot sauce. :( my BF ordered the chicken and gravy with French toast and eggs... Mediocre food! The bathrooms were disgusting! Will not be coming back here

Sweets, dinner, wine, snacks, beer, coffee and bakery all in ONE! Came here for the dessert after date night. I have been wanting to come for so long that maybe I should have waited some time in between dinner and dessert. Ordered some beignets for the mister and I.. Beignets were so AMAZING! They were just perfect. The right amount of size, warmth, sweetness, crunchiness and softness it was just delicious. Will be back soon and definitely with enough room to maybe eat more than just one lol thank you French Grocery! You and your staff were just awesome! Customer service top was great :) loved it

Their ice cream is a must! I love banana ice cream from cold stone (which only locations serve) so when I saw that they had banana nut ice cream I knew I had to try. Once I tried it was delicious. Had to get a scoop of it. They were out of waffle cones though :( sad. My BF loves horchata, everywhere we go that has horchata to drink that's what he is ordering. So I immediately saw it and he couldn't believe it he thought I was playing with him lol so he ordered it. He loved it! He thought my banana ice cream was too sweet. But I thought it was just perfect:)  Their line was too long. And hard to find parking. But it was worth it

Such a convenient location! Before or after shopping this place is the place to be. Food was delicious. I made my own pizza. Ingredients were: pepperoni, bacon, red onions, peppers, artichoke, half mushroom and half olives. I must say it was to die for! The taste was incredible. First time trying this pizza and I will most definitely come back. The customer service was superb! Very attentive. Make sure you leave enough space for that super uber delicious pizookie.

Oooohhhh seafood!! New location in Goodyear. I am so glad the new location is open. Came here three times already since its been open and hoping to come again. I love getting their shrimp and crawfish with trifecta and medium spice. It gives it such a great flavor. I usually add sausages, potatoes and corn. Omg sausages are great! And with the sauce it makes it even better!! I can live without the potatoes. Lol but definitely add some goodies to it. Hope next time I come it won't be a long wait like this last time. Due to nascar it was extremely busy. The staff is so attentive and friendly, maybe too friendly haha. if you've never been to an angry crab they will definitely make suggestions for you. So come soon
