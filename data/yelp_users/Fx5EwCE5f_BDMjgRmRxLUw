Hands down the best bar in Tempe.  Live music on the weekends, great food with a hat tip towards authenticity, a fun laid back feel, large open patio and outside bar.  Rula Bula manages to pull off the often difficult balance between great daytime eatery and fantastic late night watering hole.

If you're looking for middle eastern food in Tempe, this is a must. While the food can be slightly blander at times than some over-spiced alternatives the menu options are all delicious, the food has an authentic taste to it, and is packed with flavor.  Great venue and one of Tempe's cornerstones.

Horrible webhosting company.  I spent 7 years with them and watched as they progressively got worse and worse. I finally switched to Dreamhost and couldn't be happier.  Average website load times went from 10 seconds to about 1 for my site.  Ipower has had horribly overloaded mySQL database servers for years.  What's worse is they lie about it. Avoid this company with a 10 foot pole, especially if you have ANY database driven elements to your site.

While in Greece I fell in love with Gyros and Greek food.  When I got back to the US I spent a lot of time looking for places that prepare Greek with a nod towards authenticity. Most of the places around Phoenix are great at preparing flavored cardboard, but suck at preparing Greek food. So, as you can imagine I was thrilled when I finally found Oliveos which uses real Gyro meat cooked in an authentic fashion.  Whenever I'm in Tempe for dinner Oliveos is definitely one of the first places I consider.

I've had a horrible track record with dentists and orthodontists in the past.  Dr. Parsanko was the first dentist I've run into who invested extra energy in making the process as painless and comfortable as possible. He has an excellent rapport, is gentle, knowledgeable and thorough.  Nice facility with modern equipment. Easily the best dentist i've ever been to.

Hands down some of the best food in the valley. Even if you're not familiar with Scandinavian cuisine the staff is extremely helpful/friendly and there are a wealth of more traditional options.  The food is fresh, carefully prepared, absolutely delicious and served up with great sides.   My favorite? The surf and turf hamburger (one of the only hamburgers I've never felt the need to put catchup on btw), served with the (included) couscous side, steamed broccoli, green peas, and green beans.    Like all good food, it takes time to prepare. While this isn't the ideal place if you're in a rush, if you enjoy friendly people and good food made with loving care - this is definitely a must visit.  Hands down one of Tempe's hidden gems.
