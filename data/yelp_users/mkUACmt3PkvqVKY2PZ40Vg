Fried okra usually catches my attention, but all of their fried food is good as well, save for the fries (they're a little sub par, but still edible).  You get a lot of food for a decent price.  The place is across the street and right next to two strip joints, and it's a little sketchy coming here at night, but I've never had problems.  It's even right along the light rail, which is really convenient for times I decide not to drive.  They make their own cocktail sauce, which has more of a spicy kick than I'm used to, but it's tangy and Much better than Pete Sauce, that's for sure.

The Morning Glory Cafe is absolutely gorgeous.  The food portions filled me up halfway through.

I used to see this place all the time across the street from my bus stop when I would take the bus north to work.  When I switched jobs, a co-worker made mention of this place.  Years later, after finding myself in a "What do I want for lunch, Yelp?" moment, I decided now was the time to check this place out.  And it was totally worth the wait.  I got take-out at this place, since I was taking it to my boyfriend for his lunch break.  I ordered ahead, and was met with a super friendly staff once I got there.  The place looks a lot like Americana Grandma's kitchen--wooden walls, floral patters, silk flowers.  The place has no windows so it was kind of dim, and all of the reviews and awards in the front were circa 1990's.  The TV in the bar area was an old CRT set which, while I was there, was being replaced with a bigger CRT set.  "Oh, is that the new TV?  ...Well, new to US, anyway," one of the girls said.  I laughed.  There also seemed to be nice, harmonic teamwork among the staff which made the wait feel a little more pleasant.  The portion sizes were amazing for the price.  I ordered a the freshly carved turkey and meatloaf lunches, and they're pretty much the dinner sizes just sans an extra side.  You will eat good and probably have left overs with just that alone.  I had ordered two slices of pie and drinks the (ounce) size of Polar Pops as well, and the cashier told me ordering a certain amount had earned one of the pies for free.  Now, I've had better in other places, but I have a feeling the food is purposely bland and not overwhelming for the customers that seem to go there (older population).  But if you want a good meal that has all the feeling of going to your mom's house, this is the place.  Much better than "home-cooked styled" places like Boston Market, and for a price that won't drive you into debt.

4 stars, but mostly because I'm biased when it comes to breakfast.  I've only been here once, but that's merely due to distance.  If you're a breakfast connoisseur (that's a thing, right?) then this place does not disappoint.  Try something exciting, like the O'Pear Grenache: pear, havarti, almonds, and bacon.  Havarti and pear go excellent together, and to put them together with almonds and eggs is unthinkable.  Except it is thinkable, and it's here.

Their combo dishes give you a good amount of food for a good price.  I got the tempura udon that came with 3 pc cali roll and a salad, while my boyfriend got a rice and ramen combo with edamame.  Definitely left full and didn't pay too much.

I haven't tried any of their other offerings, but if you've got some extra change to upgrade from chain pizza, this place never disappoints.

Ordered for take-out here during what might have been the worst time to do so.  Downtown was having some sort of football thing going on, so all the streets were blocked off and traffic redirected.  Having very little patience left, I'm glad one of the ladies had the patience with me to direct me to the place.  I had no idea where parking was so I ended up right in front of the place by the gate.  Pretty sure that's not a parking place.  Left with Mema's Shepard's Pie, which was fantastic.  Maybe I'll try this again when there's no downtown event and I can find a legal parking spot.

Staff don't really acknowledge the fact that you're there, aside from when they're trying to add on services.  I guess they're used to groups of people going together, instead of going by themselves.  Either way, the service was sub par, I kinda got rushed out at closing time and ended up smudging my nails.

And once again, finding myself in the morning world, I am here.  What's with all the low blow reviews?  This place is pretty nice.  All three times I've been here, I've been graced by the same charming server and he's remembered me each time.  I don't know his name, and if I had a little less social anxiety, I'd probably ask.  Or not.  The mystery gives it a certain appeal.  Anyway, breakfast is breakfast no matter what you say about it.  That being said, this is probably one of my favorite places to go to for dishes with vegetables wrapped in egg.  It's one of the few places that has goat cheese as an option at a decent price, so 5 stars for going above the average for something like that.  Same for having a Lox dish (though it could use some capers).  It's a small thing, but it's the small things that count.  I also read/heard they're looking to get an alcohol license, probably to start serving mimosas.  If you're into that sort of thing, well, there you go.  I'm not even mad that he forgot my orange juice the last time I was here.  The place was busier than I've ever seen it, and servers are just as human as I am.  Maybe I'm too mellow to give bad reviews.  I also had a dentist appointment I had to get to shortly after, so... eh!  Whatever!    tl;dr: Go eat here, the food is excellent.

I came here with a really old bike last year.  It was an old fixed gear with a break system that made you have to jerk the pedals back in order to stop.  The staff here were very knowledgeable and, although they didn't have the parts to help me, let me know how I could fix my problem temporarily (the bike was so old that probably finding the part may prove to be more expensive in the long run).  If you have bike questions and need a space with tools to tune up your wheels, come here.  You will not be disappointed.

I love coming here. They're always upgrading the place, and the food is fantastic. I noticed they even added an American food menu for those who aren't so savvy to Filipino cuisine.  My only issue is that there is no pancit palabok on the menu.  However, if you want tapislog, sinigang, or boba, this is the place.

This review has nothing to do with the food or the service, mainly because I never got a chance to experience it.  In fact, my sole interaction with this place last week probably lasted a whole of 5 minutes, tops.  I started taking classes this semester, and in an effort to break the work-apartment-work cycle, I started looking for coffee shops that were 24-hour, or at least open late.  So, like the rest of us, I turned to Yelp for suggestions.  Buzzberry: 5am-5am?  Hell yeah!    A guy comes to the window and looks out at me as I'm parking.  It was pretty late (I headed here after my normal study place closed at 10), so I could understand the curiosity of any one coming to an empty looking establishment.  Looking back, that probably should have tipped me off, but anticipating this place to be open hadn't set off the normal red flags.  I wave at him, he walks off.  No big deal.  I get out of my car, go to the door, and... it's locked?  The dude is sitting in plain sight at the bar area, laptop open, back to me.  I tapped on the door, pulled the bar, and all but banged on it to get his attention.  He does not even acknowledge the fact that I'm there.  After a few minutes of awkward confusion, I looked for the hours of operation sign and found out why I was being ignored: The lobby is not 24 hours; the drive-thru is.  That's why this review is getting 1 star.  Granted, this is a mistake on Yelp's part and the fact that they have no real website up doesn't help, but the guy knew I was there.  He could have at least turned to face me and tell me the lobby was closed, instead of letting me stand outside in the cold with a bag full of books, knocking on the door and looking like a total idiot.  The food may be great, the service (If you get it) may be amazing but I WILL NOT be coming back here.

4 stars for my first visit.  I'm sure my rating will change to 5 as I keep going here.  The staff is friendly, and the wait wasn't long at all probably no more than 5 minutes.  The waiting room had a TV playing a kid-friendly movie on repeat, and decent amount of seating, though I'm hoping they'll upgrade from small plastic chairs to ones with cushions.  I was pretty reluctant to sit on the couch, as the term "fomite" from another review rung in my head.  (Seriously, look that up, and tell me that doesn't make you think of every chair or couch in any waiting area).  My appointment time was at 5pm, and I had used ZocDoc to get all of my new patient paperwork in.  They'll still ask you questions when you get in as a new patient, but it didn't bother me; I'd rather be asked again and feel that they're genuinely concerned about my health.  I was seen by Dr. Baoan Andy Le that day.  Excellent mannerism, seemed to really care that I wasn't feeling well, and actually pointed out something I hadn't even considered was a health problem.  Luckily, it was something that could also be tested for during a lab I needed to get.  The clinic is a little far from where I live, but I'd go far for a doctor that I felt comfortable being seen by.  My only complaint would be... the bathroom!  The switch is for the lights and fan, and that thing is Super Loud!  Don't let that put you off from going here, though.

If you had trouble locating this place, note that it's upstairs in the Arcadia Towne Center.  Funny enough, I haven't had an actual service done here yet, but coming here for my initial consultation has me recommending this place to anyone needing to go to a dentist.  First off, the reception is excellent.  I set up my appointment using ZocDoc before coming in the same day, and received an email from Penny a few hours before my appointment asking for my insurance credentials.  This place utilizes technology in order to get you in and out quicker, which is a definite plus for me.  When I came in, an older fellow came in right before me, and addressed him in a way that shows they actually care about and remember their clients.  My New Patient routine included xrays of all of my teeth by a very nice dental hygienist, who told where my problem areas were.  It was nice to have these things explained instead of having services I "needed" thrown at me.  Unfortunately, I would have to come in for a deep cleaning that would require 2 visits, but when I asked why it would take 2, I was told only because most people found a 3-hour visit inconvenient for them.  So, if you don't mind having a 3 hour cleaning, you only have to come back once!  Good to know, right?  Dr. Harman also came in to check to see if I had any signs of oral cancer, which I've heard isn't a common practice elsewhere, but part of his usual routine.

The reason I'm giving this two stars was because my problem was resolved.  Food wasn't bad, staff was alright and not completely to blame...  but the reason I'm writing a review at all is because of a situation that, in my mind, really should not have happened.  (Edit: For clarity, I ordered this online for delivery.  Why?  Because how often do you come across a Subway that delivers?)  Let's first take a moment to discuss a BLT.  Pretty simple sandwich, right?  BLT: Bacon Lettuce Tomato; a sandwich so bold, so forthright that it needs no further explanation.  Adding things to it is on you, of course, so when I ordered Subway's BLT I kept that in mind, assuming there would be no issues with such a simple base.  What I end up with is my order... sans the lettuce and tomato.  I couldn't make this up: A BLT without lettuce and tomato.  Normally, I'm the type of person who kind of shrugs off minor mistakes (mostly because I'm too hungry and the food is still consumable), but 1/3 of my sandwich is completely missing; I was too hungry NOT to do anything about it.  A phone call to the store has me talking with the manager, telling me about the standard subway policies.  Basically, the only standard on the sandwich is the meat, and everything is up to you.  So... there really is not point in even telling them the name of the sandwich you want and adding to that--you have to name what's in it and what you want added to that.  I fail to see the logic in having pre-constructed sandwiches at all.  So unless you're in the restaurant guiding them step-by-step on how to make your sandwich, you'll pretty much have to tell them, "Yes, I want bacon AND lettuce AND tomato in my BLT." (For future ref: if you really want bacon in your BLT, you're going to have to order double meat, or you'll just end up with the essence of bacon.  Those little slivers of bacon really don't cut it.)  I'd go into things about using common sense even if Subway's policies say otherwise... but then I'd be breaking Yelp's review guidelines. (;  I'm also not going to talk about the sub shop within walking distance that stays open until 3am and seems to have it together (as far as BLTs go.)

The best time to come here is before 10am on the weekdays, otherwise parking starts to get a little tricky.  This place is nice and elegant for a breakfast joint.  Water is served in wine glasses, complimentary scone at the end of your meal, and the outdoor seating is pleasant.  I had their seasonal fruit plate (which seemed fresh and was not mostly grapes like some fruit plates), and baby spinach and tomato omelette with goat cheese instead of feta.  The tomatoes were sliced cherry tomatoes instead larger diced ones, and it came with (I'm assuming) fingerling potatoes with some sort of weird spice.  It was probably paprika, but I was too underwhelmed by the choice of potato to really look into it.  Fingerlings are good, but probably too fancy for breakfast.  That being said, it's still one of my favourite places for breakfast.  I haven't tried the market part of the establishment, so no reviews there.  Yet.

I've only been here once.  Maybe I'm a 5-star review prude, but I have a feeling I'll be changing it in the future once I get a feel for the rest of the menu.  This place is pretty great for coffee and studying, but bring a jacket at night in the winter, as the whole front wall of the place is an opening glass door and is usually still open in the evening.  Good seating for hanging out or studying, and the wifi is not spotty.  I was pretty impressed by the bathroom as well--I've never seen a sink layout so beautifully done in a public place, with an actual area to set things down.  The total ambiance of the place at night is relaxing.  I ordered a simple small cappuccino, as I do when I'm testing out new places.  It was not burnt (like some places) and not too strong.  Around 9, the barista asked if he could turn down the music and flip on the Grammys, which I didn't mind; he acknowledged the fact that I was studying and let me know what was going on.  He didn't bombard me with "Do you need anything?" constantly (only asked once when I was headed to the bathroom) and let me know when it was 5 minutes to closing.  Smooth service, close to home and school, I'm certain this place is going to become a regular hang out.

It's been a while since my first review, and as said before, my 4-star would probably change to 5.  And it has.  The few times I've been here since, I've taken a client here and been here with friends.  My time here with my client is what brings me back to update.  Sometime last year I brought a client here to enjoy coffee while her peers went out to see a movie.  Since this place has a huge window for a door, it was very easy to get in, which is saying something since she uses a wheelchair to get everywhere.  The baristas were very interactive with her and asked HER what SHE would like instead of looking at here chair and immediately asking me.  They gave her options for her coffee (light vs dark roast) and really listened to her.  They even told her their names when she asked.  I wasn't expecting much coming here, but the service she received was amazing.  Thank you so much for making her night.  Also, thanks for the sugar-free syrup options.  I hope Amaretto joins them, but for now, peanut butter will do.

The area seems a little sketch, but if you're looking for authentic dishes, this place doesn't disappoint.  I got the gyro plate, while my boyfriend got the spicy Goat Biyrani.  The plates were small sized platters, which could easily feed 2 people (we had leftovers for another full meal).  You defintely get your money's worth.   Oh, and as a warning, when they day spicy, guarantee that your nose will be running and you'll be sweating and slightly uncomfortable while eating. But it's a good kind of uncomfortable.

This place is great.  The grilled vegetable medley never disappoints, and their greek fries are the best I've had.  They don't just give you dry fries with small feta sprinkles, you get small square feta chunks in with your fries.  They also use some kind of vinaigrette that's really awesome.

I can't say enough about this place.  I'm no where near being called vegan or vegetarian, by any means, but the food here is fantastic.  Had The Classic and added goat cheese on one occasion, and the Avocado Sando on another.  You don't leave here still hungry, like some health food restaurants; their portion sizes are more than fair for the price.  That being said, don't forget to leave room for pie!

A regular on my breakfast rotation.  Friendly staff, plenty of seating, and good food for a good price.  One of the very few places that has pineapple juice as a selection, which is a refreshing change from orange-apple-cranberry.

I wish I could give a ZERO STAR review for this place to further emphasize how much it is in your best interests to take your pizza craving to another business. To save you time: Skip this place.  There's a ton of other GOOD pizza places in this area that care about taking your order correctly.  Today I ordered a salad, a pizza, and a 2-Liter for myself and a co-worker.  We had never tried this place before and, since I like new things, I decided to go for it.  When I ordered, I did it with specific instructions: "no dressing for the salad" and "pepperonis on all of the pizza, mushrooms only on one half."  I didn't want a pizza my co-worker couldn't eat (she doesn't like mushrooms).  I placed the order and was told it would be here in 15-20 minutes.  I work relatively close to the location, so it seemed plausible.  Fastforward ONE HOUR after the end of the call.  If I had known this was going to happen, I would have just called Pizza Hut because, let me tell you, food triggers some emotions.  Normally, I don't notice when things are taking long while I'm working, but if I have to call and ask where my food is, you're taking way too damn long.  About 15 minutes after I call to ask where it is, the driver shows up at my door.  The pizza box looks like something heavy had been sitting on it and the guy gives me a crumpled receipt, but whatever, the food got here.  I honestly have never had to check my pizza before the driver leaves, but I should have.  First of all, all of the toppings are on one side and the other side is completely cheese.  The pizza is cold and, as another co-worker put it, "has no gravy."  He meant sauce, but damn if he wasn't right.  I check on the salad I got and aside from the sad, old tomatoes in it... they added a side of dressing.  I explicitly said I didn't want any since I never use it and didn't want them to waste it on me.  I detest wasting food, so aside from screwing up my order, taking an unreasonable amount of time, and the general shitty state of the food, I've reached my limit of patience with this place.  Which wasn't high to begin with, mind you.  I immediately call back and make my list of complaints.  The guy who answered was the person who had taken my order, and tried to say that I had asked for one side to be mushrooms and pepperoni with the other side just cheese.  At no point had I even mentioned the *word* cheese during our conversation, and the fact that he tried to pin it on me pissed me off to no end.  That is a poor business model.  I understand miscommunications, but for him to try to cover his own ass and make it a problem from my end is absolutely unprofessional.  The result in that conversation ended with a "five dollar credit to my account."  Right.  Like I'd make that mistake more than once.  A-V-O-I-D!  tl;dr: Order got messed up, customer service tried to make it seem like I screwed up.  Pizza sucked, salad was old, the only thing that came out right was the soda.

One of the few places I've seen that offers gluten-free mac and cheese.  Yesss.  Their flavored lemonades and teas are also amazing.  The only downside was seeing fruit flies.  The kitchen is open and there were veggies out being prepared, but with fresh produce comes fruit flies.  Hopefully that was a one-time-thing.

Growing up, my mom made a huge deal about how often I would eat potatoes.  10 years later, drinking more water and eating more fruits has her thinking I've changed my eating habits.  Ohhh...  This place was everything I have been looking for in "fast food."  Wendy's has nothing on this potato.  I got my spud Loaded with Sesame chicken with vegetable.  It was awesome. Miss D came out to greet me and introduced me to herself and Miss Charlotte.  It got a little shy, I'll admit.  How often does the cook come out to introduce themselves?  This place has a welcoming feel, which is good.  It is comfort food, after all.    My only cons about this place: -It gets slightly uncomfortably hot during the day in the summer, even with the fans going. It's not unbearable, but it's definitely noticeable. -There's only "bar"-style seating, so you'll most likely want to get everything for pick up. -The place is easily missed; the sign is hard to see from the street.  But if all you care about is the quality of the food and the service, well.  The food is great and the ladies are very hospitable.  One thing that really got me about this place is the set of little fliers on the wall next to the cashier window.  "____ and Bud paid it forward so ____ could get loaded."  I think that's really neat.  You can pay for the next random person or for someone you reccomend to come in.  For a place that's only been open since December, they seem to be doing well.  I will be back, and bringing friends.

Looks like they tried to make a "new" business page to fend off all the horrible customer service reviews and photos of their awful food from their old one.  They're evening stealing images off of the internet to supplement their photos.  Don't bother.  They're still terrible.

I've been sitting here for ten minutes without someone coming over.  I finished eating 20 minutes ago, with no new plates and about half of my water left. One server asked me at the very beginning of my meal if I was okay, but only then. It was dead for a good while and suddenly alive with the dinner rush, both when the servers were sitting down (one girl picking her nails and avoiding my look) to where they were all standing up and walking around, I feel like I may as well have been sitting under an invisibility cloak.  I normally have no qualms about waiting, but that's not the point.  I /hate/ leaving bad reviews (effort and all), especiallyconsidering this is one of my favorite close-by sushi places.  Unfortunately, this has been on a steady decline for me over the course of a year.  This isn't my first incident with bad staff.  Wait staff don't seem to care about being there, the fish doesn't seem very fresh (I'm not a picky eater at all), and I've never liked how thickly cut the salmon and tuna are on top of the nigiri.  The sushi chefs seem to be pretty alright, though, but they also seem like they'd rather be elsewhere.  Honestly, I'm going to give it one more shot before calling it quits.
