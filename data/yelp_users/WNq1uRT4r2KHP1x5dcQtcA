June 13th I picked up my first mountain bike, used 2013 Cannondale Trail SL2, $758.00 out the door (had some scratches obvious signs of use) but was assured it was tuned up and ready to go, beautiful bike. I noticed during my test ride the brakes were incredibly squishy so I mentioned to the owner (Eric) the brakes may have needed some adjusting, about 30 minutes later I get the bike back with the brakes "adjusted". About a week later, some friends of mine and I go on a casual morning cruise at Papago Park, things went great and had a great time! The next weekend I decided to take the bike out to some flat dirt and ride for a few miles. About a mile in both tires went flat, as a matter of fact, the front tire "stem" completely tore off the tube, leaving me stranded to walk a few miles back to my car.. Gave me time to calm my nerves. The third time I decided to go for a real ride was last weekend in Sedona. I picked a nice basic trail, loaded up on breakfast and rolled out to have some fun. About 40 minutes in to my cruise, I noticed the bike wasn't shifting well. I decided to hop off the bike and visually inspect some things (don't know much about bikes) to see if I could find something wrong, nope! So I kept riding, stuck to switching gears as little as possible, sticking on the flat terrain when I go to switch down a gear to make it easier to pedal and POP! SNAP! BANG BANG BANG BANG! I look down, and to my dismay, I see pieces of metal completely sheered off the bike frame (derailleur hanger) with the derailleur stuck in the spokes of the bike, marred up significantly. Thinking to myself now... Well shit, now I'm stuck in the desert, 4 miles in on this trail, now I have to carry my bike back. In order to roll my bike back I had to remove the back tire and sort of drape the chain around my pedal. When I finally got back to the car, to my dismay realized the chain had married up the crank so badly it was more silver than it was it's nice original black color. Now I'm back in Phx, drive done, called the bike shop (Slippery Pig), they informed me to bring the bike in. The distance from my work to home to the bike shop is significant, and after stewing over the fact I just dropped almost $800.00 on a bike that ultimately failed on me, I was not inclined to return quickly, therefor I contacted Cannondale. Cannondale referred me to another bike shop (Biker's Edge) in Peoria, much closer to home, that was and still is a licensed Cannondale repair shop. After chatting with them over the phone, very nice people by the way, I brought my bike down for a full inspection. According to the technicians at Biker's Edge, the bike was not shifting correctly because it had not been adjusted properly, an adjustment that should've been made before I was sold the bike at Slippery Pig. They continued on with saying that things like this "just don't happen", and that "they happen so infrequently for basic riders there is no need to carry spare derailleurs" because "they just don't break". At this point, I am disheartened and filled with anger towards Slippery Pig for selling me a bike that was adjusted incorrectly from the beginning leading to an incredible amount of damage (haven't seen my bike in two weeks), and had two faulty tires that blew out the first time I road (front tire was on backwards according to tire tread writing). Needless to say, Biker's Edge got the hanger replaced when they noticed some additional parts that make up the actual derailleur were loose. The parts total was about $45.00 plus $15.00 to put them on plus another $30.00 to work on the chain and cover the exorbitant amount of scratches with magic marker(not kidding), total costs ending up at $90.00. Before I moved forward with the additional repairs aside from the hanger, I decided to contact Slippery Pig to see if they could do anything for me. According to the staff at the Slippery Pig, they will cover the $20 additional part that needs replaced if I pay $10 for labor, that's all, and a sorry (which doesn't really help). Takeaway from this: I would not recommend purchasing a used bike from the Slippery Pig bike shop, nor rely on their maintenance/shop services on your personal bike. Based on my own personal experience, I have found their services to be VERY poor (except for a very nice gentlemen that went out of his way that tried to get me assistance, his name was Troy).  However, Biker's Edge in Peoria, AZ is an incredible, Cannondale certified bike shop run by a staff of 3 people, all whom are extremely knowledge, communicate effectively, establish and resolve issues deadlines efficiently, and most importantly, they devote their attention all on you when you call for help, it's a bike shop that truly cares and isn't just worried about making sales.  Out the door, $130.00 for repairs. Needed a derailleur hanger, new derailleur pulleys, brakes readjusted (overfilled) and a brand new chain because the chain was a link too short causing shift issues.

Pros:  - Staff is friendly - Shop is easy to get to  Cons:  - Poor communication - Ex: Staff asked what I needed, I requested an alignment, staff pulls truck in, does something, comes back asks for my money and says have a great day. Not one mention of the work performed, how the front end suspension looked, nothing. Just took my money and said have a nice day.  - Extremely long wait times. I showed up this morning at 8:00 on the dot. My truck wasn't pulled back into the bay until 10:15, I didn't leave the shop till 11.  Bottom line I would not recommend this shop to anyone. There's alot more to running a successful business than just being nice. The communication was poor, and the wait time was very excessively long (even though I had called the day prior to verify I could show up early have be in/out quickly).

Equipment: May 9th 1977 McLane 3HP Reel Mower  Problems: Ignition system failure, Pull start system failure, carb gasket failure,choke linkage missing, blade clutch rod missing, belt guard missing (destroyed belt), blades dull, bed knife dull, oil filter dirty and plugged up, oil change needed  Quote: $350.00 - Parts and labor  Payment Method: Credit Card - VISA  Purchased an old McLane (1977) that BARELY ran from an older couple out in Sun City. After messing around with it for a few hours, I decided to hit up Best Brothers for replacement choke linkage and a few carb gaskets. Long story short, I was sold the wrong parts, and lose $30.00, needless to say I won't be going back there.  Disheartened, I sought out help on the almighty Google, which lead me to Besco. Later that day I have Besco a call to see if they could help me out, I lady with a very nice voice answered the phone, informed me that they work on mowers like mine almost every day, was very straight forward and reasonable with the price quote for a tuneup AND also offer pickup and delivery.  Besco came out and picked my lawnmower up the very next day. I decided to swing by the shop to say hi to everyone and drop off a few extra parts I had laying around, the shop was easy to find, and everyone inside was very personable. After a few minutes of chatting with the gal up front, she had me come back and talk to Charlie.  Charlie greeted me with a smile, and asked what I was looking to have done on the mower besides the tune-up, I said "I want this thing to look and run like as if I bought it back in 1977.", Charlie let me know that the services required to make that happen were going to raise the price but that he can and will do it. Price ended up being a little extra, we shook hands and a week later Charlie calls me to let me know he's going to drop it off and that it runs perfectly now.  I'd like to also mention that I could not come down to the store to make my payment so Charlie willingly took the payment over the phone with my VISA information, seamless, ultra easy process.  And Charlie was right. This old 77' runs on the first pull every single time. The mower is powerful, cuts evenly, doesn't smoke, and most importantly, now has all the linkage it needs to run properly.  I highly recommend Besco Equipment Repair for all lawn mower/small engine repair needs. Charlie and his crew went above and beyond with this one, I can't speak highly enough of them.  Bottom Line: Worth every penny

Condensed Review:  This applies to the following names: Caliber Property Management - CaliberRealty - CaliberPM - CaliberCO - Caliber of Scottsdale and Tuscon - www.CaliberPM.com - www.CaliberRealty.com - Bryan Green - Tina Wood  Personal Experience:  Bottom Line, as far as I know, 1 important revenue stream for Caliber Co is rental application fees. They will tell you just about anything to get you to submit an application (For Example: Applications are submitted for review on a first come first serve basis, completely not true.). Shady, unfair business practices.  The realtors and property management staff DO NOT return phone calls, text messages, or emails. My personal experience has been waiting for replies in excess of 8 DAYS. No feedback, for 8 days.  This is a property management company that holds no values. Zero integrity for their work, zero respect for the customer, doing business with Caliber will lead to a lose/win situation, with Caliber's exit strategy consisting of lies, unfair business practices, and poor communication OR blame on employee performance for their short comings.  I highly recommend AGAINST pursuing any sort of business with "Caliber", "Caliber Companies", "CaliberPM", "CaliberRealty", www.CaliberPM.com, www.CaliberRealty.com  I'd like my rental application fee back as well.  There are more reviews on Google, you just have to use the correct search keywords. Looks like they've hired an SEO to hide all bad publicity.

Simple down to earth BBQ. Absolutely delicious meals cooked up and brought out. Staff is friendly, owner is the cook(very polite gentleman), and the BBQ he serves up is by far the best in the west valley! Myself and my team from work will definitely be going back!
