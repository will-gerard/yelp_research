Sun cellular was recommended to me by the Verizon store. I came in here with two LG G2s which needed screen replacements. They replaced both and it really only takes 30-45 minutes. Turns out some stuff went wrong and I came back the next day. They happily fixed the issues and then sent me off with free screen protectors for my trouble. These people are all very nice and I would send any of my friends or family to them. They don't use cheap replacements like many of the phone repair stores. I will definitely support their company in the future.

One of my favorite restaraunts. My mom is gluten free and my sister is vegan. It is so hard to find good, affordable food that meets all our needs and isn't just salad. My only complaint is they took the ravioli off the menu, which was my favorite dish. Also, the fettucini alfredo I had instead was pretty bland.

My roommate and I moved into a 2 bed 2 bath, we have been here for 3 or 4 months now. I absolutely love the complex, our apartment, and the staff. Although it hasn't always been perfect, every time an issue arises it is handled as diligently as possible. The place is beautiful and I always feel safe (as a young college girl). The staff, both office and maintenance, are professional and make you feel like you're at home. My only complaint is the paid public laundry rather than laundry in unit. However, our rent is a great deal so I was able to overlook this. We have referred two other apartments and they are also happy with the complex.

I have been coming here my entire life, seen it through many owners (especially recently..). I'm super bummed to say this play has gone down hill. The new owner has an attitude problem. She freaked out at me for grabbing the wrong cup, which she then claimed was 50 cents more. I understand she's running a business but penny pinching like that will lose you customers. Not to mention she seemed like a total control freak, seemed like even the employees were miserable. From what I witnessed, she wouldn't let her employees take orders. Which is funny to me since dealing with her slowly taking my order and rudely correcting what type of sandwich I was asking for was the worst part of my experience. She needs to back off, turn on the AC, stop skimping on the meat, and let her very competent employees work front of house.

My egg mcmuffin was covered in mold and the cheese was slimy. Don't go here, there's Wendy's next door.

This is the first vet I have come to since I moved to Tempe. My cat was diagnosed with feline diabetes which absolutely terrified me/my college budget. Without the help of this clinic I would be completely lost. Although all the people here are helpful and compassionate, I am particularly thankful for the hard work and understanding of Dr. Claus, Alison, and Holly. They have all made a difficult situation much easier and have worked within my budget.

My turkey club was pretty bland and dry, not to mention it had one small slice of tomato for the entire huge sandwhich. The $5 cheese pizza was equally as bland and dry. Not the worst, but I won't be rushing back.
