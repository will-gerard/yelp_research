By far our favorite breakfast in the Valley. Of so many great places Butterfields has the best food, and best service. Every experience delivers the same consistent excellence!

Long line. Must be good, and worth the wait. Great news: the line is fast... and it's so worth it! I had to have a Scramble, but the French Toast looked so yummy - so we got an extra plate to share and it was amazing! Everything was good, including the service, and their Strawberry French Toast has fresh homemade strawberry cream cheese served with fresh strawberry slices that is incredible to bite into.

We made a special trip and are very excited to try a breakfast burrito, but they are not opening as posted. Maybe we'll try again another time :(

The smoky aroma attracted me from the parking lot and I wasn't even there for food but I couldn't resist ordering. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the owner picks the playlist of songs playing in the background. Be prepared for a pop quiz on who's playing.  The brisket is lean and tasty, and I like their traditional sauce. If you like a little kick give the Javelina sauce a try. One thing for sure, you have to try the Pork Belly Pit Beans... OMgosh amazing!!  I haven't tried the Memaw's Michigan Farm Family home apple pie a la mode yet, but I'm coming back for it on a special trip next time.
