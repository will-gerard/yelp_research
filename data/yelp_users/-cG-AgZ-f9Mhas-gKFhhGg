The best breakfast place in the area! They have plenty of healthy options and will happily modify any item to suit your tastes. The pancakes are enormous and delicious, especially the blueberry and the seasonal pumpkin pecan. The Monterey and the pancakes are my favorites, but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Each meal is cooked to perfection and the service is eggcellent!   It is hard to think of a better way to start the day than by having breakfast at The Good Egg. The eggs are indeed good, as is everything else!

I've been here in AZ for about 6 months and Barro's is the best, most consistent pizza I've had. The staff is friendly and the pizza is delicious. 5 stars because I can't think of anything bad about this place.  The sauce is perfect and exactly what pizza sauce should be (none of that stuff that tastes like tomato paste here!). The crust is delicious all on its own and it always crusty but still moist and fresh. The cheese is obviously of good quality as well as are their veggies and meats they use for toppings. All this combines to make a great pizza. It is a little pricier than some other pizza places, buts it is also a lot better than cheap pizza, so it's worth it to spend a few extra bucks. Your wallet might not thank you, but your taste buds will.

Perfect donuts! I got the apple fritter, the maple long john, some twisty glazed donut and a chocolate glazed cake donut.  They were all fresh and didn't taste like they'd been sitting out all day (like some donut shops that shall remain nameless).  They were moist and frosted just right (not too much, not too little).  The lady in the shop was very friendly and even threw in a couple extra donuts!  Ladies and gents, it doesn't get any better than free!  This place is going to be the place I go for donuts whenever I'm in Vegas, which is quite often.  As a side note, the pictures of the policemen on the wall are a pretty good indicator that the LVPD loves this place, and cops know their donuts so you can't get a better endorsement than that!    Eat at the Donut Hut, you won't be sorry!

Great selection of genuine craft beer (REAL craft beer, not that fake craft beer like Blue Moon).  Also, great selection of pretty much everything else!

This place is terrible. I gave it two chances and it was bad on the first try and absolutely disgusting on the second try. I don't know what this place is "Number 1" of, but it sure isn't pizza.   I could tell the ingredients were cheap, the cheese just looked gross and the crust was like a cracker. The veggies on top weren't even cooked. So, there were raw, cold vegetables on top of my pizza. It was not even edible. So we returned the pizza and haven't been back since. Even though it's right down the street from me, Barro's is only a little further and is a million times better. If you are looking for pizza in Cave Creek, do not look here unless you have incredibly low standards on what constitutes edible.

The perfect donut + good coffee = Bosa.  What makes a perfect donut in my mind?  Fluffy, fresh, not too doughy and not *too* sweet.  I'm not a donut expert, but those are my factors in evaluating the deliciousness of a donut.  Bosa donuts scores an A+ in my book!  And they don't just do donuts!  The breakfast sandwiches are delicious as well.

This place was OK the first time but just terrible the second. And both times, it was nothing to write home about.  The yogurt is low-quality and ridiculously overpriced for being so below average. It's not even mixed the right way, and it doesn't taste that great. Plus the flavor options are very limited and again, nothing of that great of quality.   I don't mind paying more for frozen yogurt that is worth it, like Red Mango, or Yogurtland. But this stuff just isn't worth it. I gave it a second chance (just because it's so close to my house) and it failed again so I won't ever be going back.

Often imitated (VERY often imitated), but NEVER duplicated. Red Mango has the best frozen yogurt anywhere. It's a perfect mix of tart and sweet, it's the perfect consistency, and their toppings are always fresh and delicious! I've tried many other frozen yogurt places and honestly, none of them are as good. Some come close, but RM is the best. Plus, it's not overpriced, and that's always a plus!

Install was so fast and he made it look so easy!  I know this is not an easy process!  Scott's speed and expertise made me feel like an incompetent moron for thinking I could install it myself.  I did tryin self-install and ended up with multiple holes and screws stuck in the wall.  Scott got us all fixed up very quickly, he is a great guy and clearly cares about his work and his customers.   He was even able to hide the wires in the wall!  I don't know what sorcery was used for that, but it looks SO SO SO much better without having wires hanging everywhere.  Plus, it's safer for my baby not to have wires hanging around for her to pull.  We HAD to get this done because our baby is at the stage where childproofing is an absolute MUST and the best thing to do with the TV is to mount it.  Now I know my child is safe (at least from a falling TV) because my TV was mounted by a professional.   If you need your TV mounted, you can't go wrong here!

The food was much better the second time I went! I got the carne asada burrito and it was deliciously cooked to perfection. Guac was terrific as were the chips & salsa, as they should be at any Mexican restaurant. The service was slow which is why I'm not giving a 5 star review.

4 stars because the yogurt was delicious, the place was clean and has perfect d√©cor for a frozen yogurt shop.  The cashier was nice and service was fast and easy.    The yogurt is not like the more icy kind some other places offer, it's more creamy.  I like both kinds of frozen yogurt and I wouldn't say that one is better than the other, just different.    I tried several flavors and while they were all yummy, I went with the cupcake batter because it was the yummiest of all!  I piled on the strawberries and it tasted like a strawberry cupcake, yum!   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I felt the original tart was a little too tart, but that's really just a personal preference.  If you want some creamy yogurt goodness, you can't go wrong with this place.  In fact, I think I'll stop by there again today!

The best soul food I've ever had!  I couldn't wait to write this review because I am so excited I finally found a good soul food place in Vegas.    I got the catfish dinner and I got the fried chicken dinner for my brother.  I asked him how his was and with a mouthful all he said was "it's good as ****".  I got the collard greens and fried okra for my sides and both were exceptional.  The greens were cooked how greens are supposed to be cooked (with ham) and the right seasonings.  The fried okra was the best I've ever had, they were crispy and not soggy like some places.  The catfish was also fantastic!  It was fresh and breaded and fried how catfish should be (crispy, not soggy).  Whatever they use to bread the catfish and the okra is perfect.  I cannot express with words how my taste buds danced when I ate my catfish, greens, and fried okra.  Last, but certainly not least, the owner was absolutely charming and it is clear that she is the type of person who genuinely cares about her business.  Isn't it always easier to spend money places where you feel like they really appreciate your business?  If you are looking for excellent soul food, look no further!  This place is doing soul food how it should be done!

Ordered this via postmates twice and the first time, it was awesome. The omelette and potatoes were fantastic! However, the second time, I ordered the pancakes and I was unimpressed. After reading the reviews, I was expecting some amazing pancakes, instead, I got some overcooked (almost burnt) things that were not very good. Honestly, McDonald's pancakes are better.   My cat actually jumped on the second pancake and ruined it.  If they were delicious, I probably would have been really sad but they weren't so I just chucked it in the trash.  For the price, I was expecting much better.

I won't say for sure that this place is a racist establishment, but it sure seemed that way. I wish I could give it negative stars. My dad and brother were in town so we went here to grab some burgers and beers. The beer buckets came out relatively quick, but we waited for our food for OVER AN HOUR before deciding to leave for another burger joint. Yes, that's right, OVER AN HOUR and the food STILL hadn't come out. We ordered 4 burgers and I was starting to wonder if they had to go out and slaughter the cows or something, it was taking that long. The table to our right which showed up at least an hour after we ordered and the table behind us which showed up at least 30 minutes after we ordered both had their food brought out before ours and the only difference between those tables and us? Well, our party had 3 black people whereas the other tables were all white people.   Like I said, I won't say for sure whether we were treated crappily because of race, but really, there should be no reason whatsoever for me to even get that impression. The waitress was ok (I think her name was Brooklyn), but she should have noticed that we had been waiting for our food for, again, OVER AN HOUR and she should have done something about it. I used to wait tables back in my college days and I never would have let customers just sit for over an hour. The manager (who I'm pretty sure was drunk) should have done more than just give us 50% off of the two beer buckets we ordered. They should have been 100% off considering the HORRIBLE service and experience we had.  My alma mater sometimes has alumni events here, but I will be contacting the president of the alumni association to ensure that future watch parties and alumni events are NEVER held at this place. I have never had such a horrible experience or been treated so terribly in my life. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague.

Full disclosure:  I've never had sushi in Japan and I'm not a sushi expert.  That said, this place is great.  They serve high quality sushi that is very tasty.  It seems a lot more fresh than some other sushi places I've tried around Scottsdale.  The Prince of Persia role is my favorite.  But any roll will do because they are all delicious.

Jen is absolutely wonderful! I searched and searched and searched some more to find a photographer for our baby's 1 year cake smash. I wasn't that impressed with any of the other portfolios I was looking at, and was getting frustrated when I came across the Ali Kat site.   I instantly fell I love with her style and knew she'd be the right one for our photos. Not only is she a great photographer, but she is patient (a must when taking photos with little ones!) and really cares about her work. We will now be going to Jen for all of our photography needs!  One more thing that I think is important is the process of selecting which photos to purchase from the proofs, it's all done on a very aesthetically pleasing and reliable site. It's a very easy process, which is an extra plus. Most people like for things to be easy to save time, amiright?  Prices are very fair especially considering the quality of the work. If you're looking for a photographer, I highly recommend Jen and Ali Kat Photography!
