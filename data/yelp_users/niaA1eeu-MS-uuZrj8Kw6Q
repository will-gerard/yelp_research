Another fellow yelper on here stated it correctly with some of the negative reviews...first world problems! The food took too long, it was greasy and another I saw said it wasn't as good as Ajo Al's (gasp! Btw my friend and I got food poisoning from there so I'll never go again). I've been eating at Rosita's for a very long time. When I graduated from ASU 10 years ago, where did I go after my ceremony? Rosita's! Mother's day, my birthday, a job promotion, just because... all at Rosita's throughout the years and it has never failed me. The chips are always hot and their menudo and posole is just like mom's. The beans too! Mmm! I know many friends and family who frequent Rosita's. If you're in a hurry go to a chain but for me, I'd rather wait for my Rosita's. Thanks for over 10 years of good food and memories! I'll see you soon!

I've been eating Rito's since I was a little girl. My mom and I would go pick up my older sister from work and on the way home grab some burritos for dinner. We would get all different kinds including the red chile, green chile, bean burritos and occasionally tostadas and tacos. We'd head home to my dad coming from work and my 2 sisters, brother, my mom, dad and I would half up the burritos between us sharing and delighting in the food.  My sister we would pick up has now passed. Towards the end of her battle with cancer all she wished for was a burrito from Rito's. I live in California currently and no other place has held a candle to Rito's in my heart. Because of the wonderful childhood memories I have of this place and for always being so friendly and being consistently good I give Rito's 5 stars and a heart. My sister I'm sure would agree

I went here on a Tuesday morning about a month ago for the first time. I've passed by on the weekends and because it was always packed never stopped in. Finally it looked not too busy but it was still a little busy! Our waitress was friendly and prompt. The V12 tomato juice made in house was one of the best things I've tasted. The omelette I got was delicious, the fruit was fresh and service was very nice. I can't wait to go back for some more delicious food!

Richelle is still by far my favorite trainer. I started with UBBC because I looked in the mirror and hated what I saw. Being short at only 5'1, I saw a weight gain that had amounted to 25 to 30 pounds but looked like 50 on my small frame. My boyfriend at the time encouraged me and I signed up for the yearly "challenge." After the first day I came home and cried that I could not handle the workouts. My boyfriend told me it would get better and to stick with it. For the next few weeks I would go back dreading dying after each workout. Then suddenly, I got on the scale and poof, I had lost 5 pounds! It was working. I also noticed I began to feel stronger.  I ended up continuing with UBBC and also trained for my wedding along with my then encouraging boyfriend who became my husband and who won the 2010 challenge losing 40 pounds! I got down to 20% body fat and 114 pounds. I thank Richelle for all of her work and getting me to finally workout. Whether it was running my first 5k with the group, making friends or just laughing, I enjoyed all the workouts. I have since moved to California but I have continued to workout and maintain my 114 pounds and I have to credit Richelle for helping me change my life forever and my husband's who was once 275 and now hit the 199 pound mark! UBBC is a steal. Let's just say one month in UBBC price would equal one week in a California bootcamp. I thank you Richelle, I just wish you could move to California now!

I came to Teres a few weeks back to get a pedi and a gel mani with nail art. I walked in on a Sunday. It looked pretty slow but they said they couldn't fit me in for a gel mani with nail art and could only do a basic gel mani. I got the pedi and made an appointment for a day later for someone who could do nail art. Unfortunately I was sick and had to cancel for the following day. I luckily was able to book the same girl. I went in with the intention of nail art and did not get that at my appointment.   When I got there and showed her the picture of what I wanted she was hesitant. I asked for nail studs and they did not have those and my nail art, she couldn't do it. She asked the other technicians and everyone was too busy to help. She persuaded me to just go with glitter. It was not at all what I wanted. I have gotten some ornate nail art and last time I did it was $45 with tip. This was $41 for glitter and no nail art. I had seen the pictures on instagram and it seemed they all knew nail art. Not so. Also there was not much nail cleaning. My nails are chipped and gel usually lasts me until I get it removed or it grows out. I had high hopes but I guess my search for a place to do nail art continues. Pedi was good so 2 stars for that.
