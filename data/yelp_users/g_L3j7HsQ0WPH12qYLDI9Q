The service is little to be desired.  Asking a waitress to place our order seemed to be putting her out. I do not know how this restaurant stays in business with the horrible service. We will NOT be back.  It is a shame, the food is really good.

I have come here for years and have always had great service and food.  It is nice that they change up the menu at least once a year. Unfortunately they removed some of my favorite items.  I have made Half Moon my destination for Halloween and New Years Eve. They have great specials not to mention how conveniently close they are to my home.

I have been to Rustic Cafe in the past and service was sketchy at best but I thought that it has been awhile and I would give it another shot. I should have listened to my gut. As we entered the restaurant, we get seated immediately. Not a bad start. We were handed menus and that was it. We sat and waited to be acknowledged. The owner and the hostess then put together tables for a large party directly behind us. As the guests of the large party started to show up and be seated, the hostess asked each of them, "What would you like to drink?" All the while we sat still with no acknowledgement from any staff member.  6 people for the large party had shown up and each received their beverage. I then made the decision to leave and the hostess never even acknowledged our departure as we walked right past her.  Once I left the establishment, I called and spoke with the owner. All he could say was "Sorry". I try to support the businesses in my neighborhood and small businesses at that. You make your own decision.  Just remember, I told you so. A sad day for me.
