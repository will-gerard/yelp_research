I have gone 4 times now and 3 out of 4 times I have ordered from the deli sandwich area and the people there have been absolutely rude. Carmen, the manager, today was beyond rude and eye rolled me three times. I wish other stores had the pesto veggie cause I would so much rather go somewhere with a little bit of manners.  I completely understand everyone can't have a good day but everyone that I work with who goes there says the same about the people there. Sadly, its just the sandwich area because I've dealt with some of the cashiers and they have been so friendly.
