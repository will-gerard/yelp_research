The sushi is always delicious, especially the ones listed on the underground menu (the volcano roll is to die for). We always go there for every special occasion. While it's true that the service is slow on Saturdays due to their all-you-can eat sushi special, I otherwise have no complaints.

We went for the happy hour and were NOT disappointed. The appetizers were delicious and cheap (highly recommend the grilled cheese appetizers... brie, fig jam and apples? Yes, please) and the drinks were more booze than filler, a great deal for $3 a pop. I left with a wonderful buzz and a full stomach for a mere $18, which is unheard of. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was laid back but fun.

After hearing all the "OMG" reviews, I just had to try them out. Honestly? So not worth it for the money I spent. My mom's taste WAY better, and she makes them out of a box. Save your money and make your own. I didn't think it was possible to have a combo or dry AND oily, yet Sprinkles manages to do both. The frosting is cloying/super sweet and if I didn't have diabetes before, I'm certainly going to have them now.

We decided to go to The Mission for my 24th birthday. When we first parked, we were having trouble finding the restaurant, so a nice guy asked what we were looking for. We told him we couldn't find The Mission, he smiled and told us to follow him. Along the way, he recommended several of their dishes. After we were seated, he came over... turns out it was the owner, Brian! He was such a sweet guy and even sent over chocolate cake at the end of the meal, complete with a sparkler.   The food was beyond delicious. I absolutely HATE guacamole, but their homemade guac was absolutely amazing... very complex and flavorful. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos, which were really good. My husband had the steak tacos and my parents had the pork shoulder tacos. Everything was so tasty and helped make it a really memorable evening.   What really made it, though, was how friendly and attentive the staff was. I was double impressed that Brian took the time to come over and talk with us. These are the little things that can make or break the dining experience.

The prices are perfect and I love their selection. It's clear that a lot of love and attention goes into the store and it's collection. They're always very friendly and I love the customer service.

Sooooo good and a great concept. The yogurt is creamy and delicious and the toppings are always fresh (and there are a TON to choose from). The place itself is very clean and the staff is really friendly. Perfect for a quick, easy, low-cal lunch (yogurt with fresh fruit) for under $5.

The clothes are decently priced and there are some real hidden gems in there. The girls who work there are super friendly and sweet. They're not in your face, pressuring you to buy, but they let you know they're there if you need them.

I had 2 hours before an interview and not a damn thing to wear. TK helped me put together and awesome outfit. I love that she took the time to help me out. Even better? Her store has every size for every body type, not just 2's and 4's. The prices are super reasonable and I love almost everything in the store.

There's not a whole lot left to say except that great customer service, delicious food and very affordable prices make this place an amazing find and one of my favorite places to eat. Oh, and the Vampiro and horchata are truly to die for.
