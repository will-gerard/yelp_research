I got the beef machaca burro enchilada style.  The prices are pretty cheap which is nice, but I'm not sure it's worth the calories.  The meat inside my burro was burnt on some pieces so every bite had a strand or two of "jerky".  The flavor isn't terrible but how do you mess up tortilla and enchilada sauce right?  The burnt meat really cut into the enjoyment of my meal but also some pico de gallo or even just some onions/green onions would be nice to cut the heaviness of the dish.

It's a little hard to believe that this unmarked house across the street from a school is actually a restaurant, but once you get beyond the security barred door you find yourself in a dimly lit, non-temperature controlled waiting room.  It must be good though because I've never seen this room empty.  People come and go the whole time you're waiting for your food.  They stand behind the security bar and you exchange payment/receipts through the space underneath.  Then you wait and get your food under the grate next to the "order here" window.  Why all the security?  I'm hoping never to really find out..  The food!  Although it's a bit nickel-and-dimey, ultimately it's decently priced.  It seems like they typed up a nicer looking menu recently too that helps immensely (before all I had was a picture of the lego board they had up).  Anyway, the food is pretty legit authentic Mexican dripping with verde sauce and covered with cheese.  If you're looking for Mexi-comfort, look no further!

I don't think enough people knows and/or takes advantage of all the Phoenix Public LIbrary has to offer!  I love getting cookbooks, movies, and tv shows - you can rent the whole season all at once!  This library used to smell like sweat when you walked in but now since its been deep cleaned it just smells like old books.  Sometimes there are people out front asking you to sign petitions or offering you the key to the kingdom of heaven but they've always been polite so far when I say "no thank you" or just don't seem interested.  Oh, and the best feature is you can search online through all the items any of the libraries carry and have them shipped to your local branch.  Then you just have to go to the hold section, pick them up, and check out.  The check out process is so easy and fast and the library staff at this branch is so nice.  This is really an amazing service provided by our tax dollars and we should all take advantage!

I had a restaurant.com coupon so I got to try a bunch of stuff (but I guess they don't take these anymore, our waitress had to check with the manager to let us use ours).    Seems like a happening, dive-bar type environment.  They were finishing up a poker tournament which it seems like there's one like every day.  Not sure why they left all the tvs on a channel with a cleft-palate infomercial for a charity pretty much all night, it was kind of a downer...  The pasties were phenominal.  A definitely must-try, and will get every time I go there.  The wings were so-so, we ordered medium which were pretty hot, but there wasn't much to the sauce but Red-hot it seemed.  The fish and chips were good, which some places mess up with the batter being undercooked but they seemed to do a pretty good job.  The shepherd's pie was ok, though isn't it supposed to have a crust at the bottom?  Wasn't sure.  All-in-all, a good place to start off a night or hang out for a game.  Would not go for more than a happy hr type venture.

I enjoy this place.  It's interesting.  :)  They used to serve a blueberry bread but now its some kinda cinnamon and sugared pumpernickel bread and dinner rolls.  Eh.  The sushi here is perfect.  Just the right amount of rice, fish cut just right and not boxy and thick on one side - pretty much as perfect as you can get around here.    The ramen is ok.  I thought the noodles were kind of lacking.  The broth was decent, though kind of heavy with sesame.  The pork was flavorful and plentiful.    Mostly its the atmosphere and the "little known" quality of the restaurant that is good.  The food is solid and pretty consistent.  The service is always pretty good.

We opted to sit in the patio area since they had the AC running kind of hard inside.  It was a very charming brick patio area with large shade trees, water feature, and candles and other lighting everywhere.  The unnoticeable speakers played soothing music which wasn't too loud or too faint.  Just perfect.  We ordered the 3 onion tarte for appetizer which was very delicious.  The crust was perfect and the inside wasn't overwhelming in any way.  It came on a bed of greens which had a cheesy dressing that I didn't like (a very light coating, but I don't really like that type of cheese).  I ordered the lobster and my friend the lamb shank for entree.  Both were delicious, but I would recommend the lobster and the lamb only if you really like mediterranean type food.  We got the 4 berry tarte for dessert which was excellent.  The tart crusts in general were just perfect.    Overall, loved the atmosphere - mix of stately and quirky - and loved the food.  The owner's very nice and introduces himself to everyone and checks into everyone's evening.  The cost is kind of prohibitive to going weekly, but would definitely check out the posted menu for the season for a yearly treat.

We've been back a couple times more since and both times we've gotten the cheese platter.  Its a little pricey at $18 but I would highly recommend it.  Last night we tried the halibut and the salmon.  Both were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly.  I love the flavor combinations.  We had the lemon tarte to finish and once again was fully impressed.  As pricey as the menu seems, if you want to be impressed with food that really amazes pretty consistently, its worth it every time.

This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!  It's semi divey but the food is very consistent and they do a rotating menu.   Their happy hour menu is pretty good too!   The wings are always meaty and cooked crispy.   I like the armadillo gold sauce and can't do wrong with mild, medium, or hot.   The potato skins are good, but standard.   I wasn't a huge fan of the fried pickles but I usually don't like them anyway.   The calamari is one of my favorites - fried crispy with a light batter and seasoned with salt and pepper,  comes with a great chunky marinara sauce.  We've also had the Louisiana Shrimp which is awesome (but not on the happy hour menu).    They have such an enticing menu with solid offerings, I can't wait to try them all!

This place seems to want to get rich off being featured on Food Network.  There's a big banner out front now and there are pictures all over the place of the owner (i'm guessing) and Guy.  Anyway, this is why I decided to try the place at all so maybe it worked.  My friend ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and I went with the Linguine with Red Clam sauce.  Its a very tiny place with plastic patio chairs.  We waited for about 20 min so we had time to check out the decor.    The prices are crazy!  They charge as much as a full Italian restaurant does - I've never seen a diner, drive thru or a dive that charges so much per plate!  Skimming the menu, I'd say the average entree is about 12, appetizer is 8, desert is 5.    So by the time we got our food we were starving, but we managed to drive home which was about 5 min away.  They gave me a few pieces of bread for my pasta which was very good (and very surprising because bread is on the menu for like $5).  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was WAAAY salty.  The portion wasn't what I expected for the price I paid at a "dive".  The sandwich was a little better, but nothing special.  I work at a hospital and I'd say their chicken parmigian is better.  All in all, this wasn't the best experience.  I say if they want to charge so much, open an actual restaurant.  Then maybe they can serve some liquor instead of just having pictures of wine bottles everywhere and empty vodka bottles holding flowers.  (Its BYOB, $5 corkage fee).  I'm very disappointed in Food Network.  :\

I think the owners changed..  The price is kind of high now and the gyro is not as good it seems.  Not enough sauce maybe?  The fries are ok, but the seasoning is not very even.  They have a frequent flyer's card - I think if you buy 10, you get 1 free.  Maybe I'll check in on them again because I think the husband and wife team was just starting out when I went.

I'm a little disappointed, it seems like I've eaten here before and it wasn't so bad.   The caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo.  They cooked my medium steak pretty well, but turned out they had switched my friend's steak and mine and his was supposed to be medium rare.  I feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak.  The mashed potatoes were lumpy.  They tasted ok, and did not feel pasty but could've used some kind of flavor.  The green beans were actually pretty good.  The salmon was cooked well but the citrus based sauce was a bit too sweet.  The sauce that came on the steaks was better, but didn't have much flavor.  The steaks themselves could've used a bit of salt and pepper.  The creme brulee was pretty tasty as always but I wasn't a fan of the flourless espresso chocolate cake.    All in all, I don't think the experience and food is as put together as their competitors.  The waitress also seemed a bit joyless which didn't help the experience.  With so many better options, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe for lunch?

The view is awesome.  Way better view than from Hilton's Different Pointe of View.  That said, we bought the Travelzoo voucher for a dinner for two.  First course consisted of shrimp cake or butternut risotto.  The risotto was bland, and the shrimp cake was very flavorful, but the sauces on the plate were noncontributory.    For second course we tried the tomato fennel soup and the green salad.  Chef Ramsey would've had a field day - the portions were vastly different among the group.  The salad was good, but not very proportionally or attractively plated.  The soup was ok but nothing to write home about.  For entrees we got the beef medallion and the trio of fish.  Portions are pretty small here..  the medallions basically looks like a fancified Banquet dinner.  The gravy was sweet and the dish was pretty tasty, but not for the price.  The fish over couscous was cooked well.  Not the most satisfying dish.  We got dessert of chocolate swirl cheesecake that the server said was "phenomenal".  I'd save the 8 dollars and get some Ely's at a grocery store.  The espresso creme brulee was more creme than brulee.    Even with the voucher, the tab came out to about 55.  I had a wine (the worst wine I've ever had at a restaurant, it tasted like they had it open for a day and watered it down) and the cheesecake, but there was gratuity for original tab (120) and with tax, it was about 55.  All in all, I would have liked to check out the view during the day as well, but I definitely wouldn't come for the food.  The server probably could have been a bit more professional.  We had a large group and in the beginning he gave us a lot of attitude about the division of tabs.  Understandably overwhelming and maybe frustrating, but "holy f***" is not a very appropriate thing to say right in front of the guests.

I've been to this bar on several occasions, a couple times for happy hour and a couple times paying retail.  I seem to be hooked on their nacho mama's chips because every so often I get a strong craving for them.  They're different from the typical chip, its somehow puffed up.  The salsa that comes with it is a good accompaniment and I always end up going through at least 1 refill of it.  I usually don't like the cheese melted on top method that solidifies halfway through (versus the nacho cheese sauce), but it goes well with the chips.  I think if you have 3-4 people and you share its perfect, portion wise and cheese wise.  The sliders are ok, pretty typical.  Kinda dry, I like to cover mine with ketchup.  The crapcakes are good, but pretty small.  I keep meaning to try some of the dinner items on the menu.  The beer is kinda pricey retail - it was $5 for draft hefeweisens when i went last night.  It wasn't happy hour but geez..

I love that the hot food is on hot plates and salad is on chilled plates.  The salad is very good - good dressing, nice bite size pieces of lettuce, crouton, tomatos, etc.  Their sides are solidly done and their service is superb.  I thought them a bit stuffy before, but upon revisiting - I think I am a fan of their consistent and excellent performance that overrides the annoyance of being forced to valet.

Really it'd be a 3.5 star, but edged up by the great service and really above par design of the place.  We got the grilled artichokes to start.  It was very simple and good with a tasty aoli to dip it in.  The char on it was perfect and you can really taste it - not sure if its wood?  The burger of course had that great flavor on it as well.  It was a gigantic meat patty full of fatty flavor.  The bun was almost strong enough to handle it all, and there was an aoli it seems on it as well.  The shoestring fries that accompanied both our dishes were a bit greasy - kinda reminded me of In-and-Out but maybe a little crispier.  They have ketchup and a spicy aoli which was disappointingly not as good on the fries.  It has a very asian taste to it - like red pepper, rice wine and sesame oil taste.  It might be better with calamari or something else..  The chicken sandwich was innovative - it was presented as a sub cut into 3 sections which is nice.  It had a kale based slaw on it, which was delicious but a bit too dressed.  The chicken cutlets were VERY thin in some sections (think McDonald's burger patty thin!) so you can hardly taste any chicken.  I even considered taking apart a section to double up the chicken in the segment I ate.  Generally, I don't like too much meat in my sandwiches too so this was definitely a first.  So this far in I'm thinking this is a 3 and I feel terrible from all the grease and mayo-like sauces I just ate.  Then the waiter talks me into a 5 nut brownie dessert that makes me want to go back even now as I write this.  Pistachio, macadamia nut, walnut, and who cares.  AWESOME, and WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK OF THIS SOONER??    I'm definitely gonna check out their happy hour and get that brownie again.

So disappointing!  We waiting over 30 minutes to be seen at the "genius bar" for my boyfriend's phone that has seen better days but really was working fine until just going out yesterday.  They barely looked at it and said they couldn't do anything to salvage any of the data in the phone.  They just tried to sell us a new phone.    We took it to one of those repair shops and within a few minutes they said it was most likely a battery issue.  $45 bucks and an hour later, the phone was as good as it was the day before.  Genius bar is a joke!  Go to a real repair shop.

We'd been meaning to try this restaurant for years so we finally went for restaurant week this year.  The bread basket with mini croissants and a few pieces of grilled bread was delicious.    The lobster and corn fritters were edible, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  The salmon quesadilla was much better.  The tenderloin was decent but a bit overcooked and not inspired.  The prawn dish was pretty good.  The portion sizes of these plates were underwhelming.  Dessert could have been better..  I had the crepes - they were a bit dry without a little bit of chocolate in the folds...  They were much better with some cream from the pots de creme that came for the table on the house (everyone gets this and its actually very good).  The chocolate tart was the best dessert on the prix fixe menu.  The cheesecake had a weird crust that didn't taste or feel good.  All in all, I may try the bistro next door but probably won't come to the restaurant again.

Definitely hits the spot when I'm craving some korean food.  The meat is never dry, comes on a bed of cabbage and a scoop of rice and macaroni salad.  A great spot for an asian type lunch with big portions and quick service.

Honestly, they can get some better quality ingredients if they're going to charge so much for a sandwich.  However, they make a good sandwich - not all sloppy, not oversized, good combination of ingredients.  I will probably go back and pay the hefty price next time I'm in the vicinity.  :)

Let me preface this by saying I was a "sandwich artist" once.    I ordered a meatball sub and typically they ask what kind of cheese you would like first so it can save the bread from the sauce so it doesn't get all soggy.  The lady didn't do it in this order AND put the meatballs right at the weakest part of the open bread - right in the middle.  Needless to say, when I got home 5 minutes later, the food was still hot but the sandwich was a sloppy mess.  I lost meatballs left and right and eventually just ate with a fork.  I'm hoping that this isn't another change in procedure at Subway - I was very sad when they got rid of the U-cut, though it is understandably hazardous for all parties involved..  Meh, I still cringe at the memory of soggy bread!

Cash Only!!  Muy importante!  I kind of feel bad doing this because we ordered the cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant, but even our worst expectations were blown away.  You get a school cafeteria type burger with a patty as slim and small as McDonalds but without the flavor and fried crispy.  It's such a weird texture...  No tomato or onion, just a little bit of shredded lettuce.  The fries were soggy with oil, obviously not cooked at the right temperature and very unappetizingly brown.  Oy!  I wouldn't rate it so bad just on the cheeseburger, though it was pretty darn bad.  I had a burrito enchilada style with some rice and it had much to be desired as well.  It was edible, there's some dry shredded beef in the middle of a tightly rolled burrito.  The "smothering" of enchilada sauce and cheese left much to be desired.  I usually don't like a huge pile of cheese on top but this was laughable as it probably covered maybe half the burrito.  I guess the ration of sauce and cheese is about 2 tablespoons.    The chips were good, but I don't think you should be able to call hot sauce salsa.  It's more like hot sauce, no chunks of anything and not much seasoning of anything.  I think I'll check out Del Taco before coming here again sorry to say..

The Old Brass Rail has replaced Ihops and Denny's pretty much completely for me.  The breakfast is just perfect for me and its 3 bucks!  2 eggs any way you want it, 3 bacon/sausage, hash browns and 2 slices of toast.  I eat pretty much all of it and I'm neither stuffed and slothy nor wanting more.  3 bucks!  I gotta say once in a while the bacon is a little bit too crispy, and the hash browns aren't as crispy as I like it, but hey for 3 bucks I'm taking that risk every time!  And its not like I haven't paid more for flops at a more expensive place before.    I would also recommend the spicy/seasoned fries.  Very good.  Other than that, the sandwiches and burgers are pretty run of the mill.  Good pricing of course.  They also have dinner specials.  I think something like meat loaf dinners and pork chop dinners on certain nights for like 5 bucks.  Never tried it but have been meaning to.  All in all, this place is pretty awesome once you get past the dark, dingy atmosphere.  But I think its on purpose.  :)

This used to be our favorite breakfast place.  Now the food is hit or miss and service is very spotty.  Sometimes they're really slow, sometimes they just get the order all wrong.  Last time we were there, our eggs over hard came out easy, the bacon was like jerky (which I didn't really mind), and the hash browns were burnt on the bottom.  My dry english muffins were sogged down with butter (squeezed a tbs out of each half).  Like I say, its been spotty so I think I'll give it some time before I try them again.. :/

Made an Open Table reservation that apparently didn't make it in.  Luckily they had a spot for us on the terrace but I kind of wonder if they just wanted us to appreciate the view..  Good view, but a little annoyed at passing a half empty air conditioned room to get to our table.  The ironic thing is we probably would have chosen to sit outside if given a choice.  The bread came with a pesto, some kind of dip and a raspberry butter(?).  Nothing outstanding although I did enjoy the pesto.  Maybe if the bread was warmed a bit it would have been better.  The lobster bisque was very good.  Didn't taste too fishy but had a nice full lobster flavor.  Liked the touch of creamed corn.    We both got the halibut as our entree.  It was good, but I wouldn't say outstanding.  None of the parts were awesome and together they were just ok.  Presentation was lovely..   For desert I got the upside cake.  The coconut sorbet (?) was good, the cake was passable and the cut fruit didn't add or detract much from the dish.  I was kind of disappointed because the place had such great ratings.  The view was nice and the drive up was exciting.  But the dinner was anticlimatic that climaxed at the bisque.

I made an appointment for someone to take a look at my roof.  They were 15min late so I just left since this was for a rental.  They called me later and said I didn't need to be there, which was not what I was told by the person who set up the appointment in the first place.    So this was on the 16th and sure its the holidays, but why does it take this long to drum up a bid?  So I sent a message through the website to which I didn't receive any response.  Then I called and an answering service took a message saying they were open that day and would call me back.    I've pretty much given up on this company at this point.  :/

This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.  All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again.

Definitely reminded me of home (Chicago).  I love these mom and pop stores, especially ones that have been around over 10 years.  Pricing is reasonable, food is decent and well portioned, and though its greasy and bad for you, sometimes you just gotta.    The gyro was worth it for me.  The chicken picado wasn't very good and though we thought it might be a healthy choice it was greasier than the gyro and had too much jalapeno on it.  Fries are average.

They are friendly enough and service was good.  Bread was decent, pesto sauce was good but could have used either salt or parmesan.  Fusilli Bolognese was actually rotini, but good.  I really like the sauce.  It could have used a little parsley for freshness and color.  The cheese ravioli I'm not too big of a fan of, the sauce is watery and salty and it wasn't great?  But its not a dish I favor and my friend says that its not mushy like it typically is so it might be a good version.  Will definitely go back.

Ok, so the wait staff isn't great but I mostly care about the food.  We got lamb chops and crab cakes for appetizers - both were delicious with a capital D.  The bruschetta was plain and a bit soggy.  The filets were wonderfully seasoned - possibly using seasoned salt instead or with the plain.  The plates weren't very hot so the meat was cooked to order and stayed that way through the whole meal.  The asparagus was trimmed nicely and a bit overdone, but the mashed potatoes were seasoned perfectly.    Would I go back - definitely for a good meal.  If service means a lot to you or you want to impress someone, I wouldn't recommend it.  Its not that they're rude by any means, its just rather clumsy with several faux pas.

I was hungry for a slice and my favorite place in old town was closed.  So, we'd been meaning to try Nello's anyway so we went in.    We ordered the 14" Numero Uno, which is homemade sausage with mushrooms, pan crust.  It looked great and it smelled great, and it had a great cheese coating, so imagine my surprise when I bite into it and find that its very bland.  The crust was good.  I can taste the cheese..  I tried putting a ton of red pepper flakes on top and then parmegan cheese, but it didn't help much at all.    Very interesting.  I kept eating it trying to figure out the problem.  I've had mushroom on pizza before by itself and it didn't taste like this.  The crust is ok, not undercooked although it kind of tastes similar to undercooked dough.  I think it might possibly be not enough sauce.  I'm still not sure...  But I will stick to Best of Italy, thank you very much.

I got a blueberry pie.  The filling is decent, however the crust is just awful.  The bottom crust is almost soggy and I'm not even sure its fully cooked.  The top crust is not flaky at all.  I will most likely pass on this one in the future.

Its pretty expensive..  Everything's about 4 dollars minimum but the food is quality.  The flavors aren't very new and exciting, but you can tell the ingredients are quality and they don't skimp.  The texture is good quality.  Love the whole almonds in the rocky road!  :D

This is the best pizza place I've found in Phoenix so far.  Truly one of the must-trys.  I think they have a grandfathered brick oven?  Not sure if its a rumor or not...  but something makes their pizza delightful.  Very good New York style pizza!  I haven't been able to try anything else but judging from these reviews I really should..  Oh, and did I mention?  Its like 3 bucks a slice!

Sigh, so much for my favorite pizza place.    I'm not sure if the place changed hands, I didn't see Pino when I went last night.  The service was very slow and the pizza was so disappointing.  I used to love this place and now I'm not even sure the pizza's average.

This place is way overpriced, as far as the steakenburger part goes.  Bread's meh, the philly steak is meh, all in all - meh...  But very overpriced.  Think 8 bucks for a steakenburger (burger with philly meat as well) fries and drink.

I'm not sure how sushi can be mediocre but it was.  It wasn't exactly the size or sauce..  It seemed like the parts and the sizes were right but somehow it didn't have the taste of good sushi.  Maybe I was embittered by the overpricing.    We did get appetizers and chicken fried rice as well.  The fried rice had a pungent smell at times and a fishy taste.  Hopefully this was intentional..  The dumplings were ok, the egg rolls were nasty and the crab rangoons were good - but the sweet and sour sauce was somehow bland.  Really not sure how it could be so..  mediocre to poor...

We ordered the berry and candied walnut salad that was wonderful.  Some of the spring mix used was a bit black in parts but the taste of the other ingredients and dressing helped make up for it.    The pizza was very reminiscent of the Midwest and made me think of home.  The cheese was good, a bit heavy on the green peppers but the sausage was very good.  I thought the dough however was bland and seemed overworked.  It was a bit dense, but not like Rosatis cracker like crust, perhaps because it was so bland.    All in all, I wouldn't make a special trip.

Had breakfast here, thought it was going to be a treat since there were all these people waiting out front and there was a 20 min wait for a table inside.  I ordered the wild mushroom omelet and my friend ordered the blt with cottage cheese since they didn't serve sweet potato fries yet apparently.  (I wasn't too impressed with the menu selections either btw, there was like 5 salads and 6 sandwiches for lunch, but i guess it is BREAKFAST club) The omelet wasn't very good - I'm not sure if it was because I should've ordered a meat along with the mushroom or the 1/4 lb brick of cheese inside but overall it was bland and the cheese was just ridiculous even after I pulled the excess goo out.  No amount of ketchup, salsa, Tabasco or Patio could salvage it.  My friend was nice enough to trade with me halfway through and the BLT was ok, but I gotta say this even though it feels wrong - there is too much bacon.  There would be a pile of 5 strips of thick sliced bacon in each bite and whereas I do love bacon, it was a bit overpowering.  Not to mention, between each slice was a thick layer of grease which made me wonder if they cooked it in layers in the oven???  Anyways, after I pulled out all but 2 layers the balance seemed restored AND my friend got some meat for the omelet.    All in all - the service was great, the hash browns were good and I loved the strips of red and yellow peppers in it, but did not like the menu selections which were pretty limited and the entrees.  The omelet had more cheese than egg, and the BLT had more bacon than LT and bread combined.

So first off, an orange table on a sign on a pillar facing the opposite direction of the entrance into the park from the parking garage is not a great way to show people that your business is in fact right there.  We wandered to the left and right of the prominent Jewel of the Crown and finally had to call the brusque busy man who half thought we were at the Fashion Square though I started the conversation with where exactly in the mall are you because we're in front of AZ88.    We finally figure out the door which was also covered by a huge 7 foot tall man watching another man on a ladder screw in a bracket.  Both men have their backs to us and are completely blocking the door.  We walk up behind them and watch the man screw in the bracket and finally the tall man moves aside just enough for me to get to the door.  Guess they weren't expecting customers.  The food itself isn't awful.  The bloody mary is tiny for a $7 cocktail and both burger and sandwich were a bit overpriced for what they were.  They both came with some potato chips and a pickle and came in a little over $10 each.  The burger was actually decent, though it was a little rare for a medium.  The flavor of the meat was actually quite nice.  The sandwich was ok, though it almost seemed like sliced deli meat pan fried (not a breast).    They're shutting down and renewing themselves as some other establishment.  Hopefully they'll have a sign up by then.

This is a neat guitar shop with just about everything you'd want in such a little space.  I came to get my guitar set up and it was evident that they are knowledgeable and responsible people.  They're awesome.  Get your guitars wherever, but for set ups and repairs, this is the place to go to!

I love their chips and salsa.  Both types are pretty good, though I'm always partial to the one that's more like pico de gallo.  They come free when you sit down which is something I always look for and appreciate.  :)  Their tortilla soup is pretty good, though it looks a bit oily and the chips get soggy pretty fast.  Their tacos are ok, although they're right there with julioberto's which are $1 mon-wed.  I usually don't like refried beans but I'll eat theirs.  I love their fish tacos and the cucumber sauce that they come with.  All in all, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  The prices for their entrees are kind of hefty, but I like their bar atmosphere once in a while and their food is pretty good.  I go here when I feel like La Pinatas but don't feel like driving over there.

They're slipping something fierce.  One of their best dishes is the fish taco, which I got just over a week ago.  Yesterday however the fish came out extra stinky (old fish), and they tried to cover it up by making it super salty.  Now I have to find a new Mexican sit down restaurant.  :/

Service was awesome.  The location is nice - a lot of people watching opportunity.  Had one of the best cheese plates I've ever tasted with 5 very likable cheeses yet a good variety.  The chop salad is a must try.  Chicken wrap was so so but the open face steak sandwich was delicious.    Value's ok as well.  Just don't get soda ($4 for a mini plastic bottle!)  Definitely pick up deals when you can too!

Ok, the prices on the happy hour menu is kind of high to be happy about but the food is pretty solid.  The sliders are a bit weak - 2 per order, comes on a plate with some horseradish and aujus and fries.  The sliders themselves are actually small bits of sirloin meat.  With the sauce it was actually quite tasty.  The waiter kinda spilled au jus into the horseradish while delivering the plate which kinda made it look unappetizing but I'm glad we pushed through.  :P  The green chili pork is very good.  I like the hint of spice and large chunks of pork.  It comes with a couple of grilled tortillas.    We also tried the chicken flatbread which was a bit more oily than I thought it would be but the pesto flavor really comes through and the chicken bits on top were plenty.    The big ass burger was also delicious, however, a bit dry.  At $11 it really should be juicier.. afterall there are many ten dollar burger places one can go to in that area.  All in all, it's a decent spot for happy hours with friends.  The drinks are a bit weak and they charge $5 each.  There probably are some better spots but I would recommend trying at least sporadically.

I called on Monday on the first of my 3 days off to see if I can get my oil pan gasket repaired like I'd been meaning to.  They said it would be about $250 and Wednesday morning would work if I'd drop it off in the morning when they open.  So I dropped it off at 715am and called around 2pm after I hadn't heard from them expecting my car to be done or close to done.  Turns out they hadn't even looked at my car yet.  Then they told me they had to fix the oil (?) sensor and wanted to do a blue dye diagnostic test.  I paid about 150 for that.  After about 3k miles I went back and they told me what I had told them in the first place.  Its probably the oil pan gasket and its 250.  They also said it could be something else that cost 850.  I'd invested so much I decided to go for it.  Maybe they're just thorough right?  So a week later I went out of town for a few days and came back and sure enough, oil is still leaking out of my car.  So it must be an $850 repair thing.  However, I'm a bit annoyed that they try to make you schedule an appointment every time, but they don't have the same respect for your time.  After that first time, the next one I asked them how long it would take (a couple hours) so I scheduled to come in first thing (7am).  When I asked them if it would be done by noon they wouldn't even promise me that at first!  That's 5 hrs for something that takes 2hrs according to them.  So for that I don't think they're the auto repair shop for me.

I always get cheese pizza.   I've tried toppings but they're always worse!  Just get the cheese pizza like a true new yorker and you'll be way more happy with your pizza.   Also if you get it carry out after you order online,  be early!   They just want to be safe than sorry,  but nothing beats a pizza fresh out of the oven.

So I'm not sure how this place gets a 4 star rating on Yelp but when you look at specific entrees at least for chinese entrees they're all "not bad" type of reviews.  But I had a pot sticker craving so I ordered a few items that seemed decent per reviews.  The guy said 15-20min but it took 40 minutes.  The pot stickers (which I got pan fried vs steamed) were actually more like deep fried.  The sauce is more sweet, not vinegary.  Not terrible but out of 6 there was about 2 that had a decent amount of filling, the rest had about a tablespoonful in a dumpling that is about 4 inches long and 3 inches tall.  The taste of the filling and the dumpling dough was good, just poor proportions and a bit greasy.  The sweet and sour chicken was bright pink and more onion than anything else.  Overall somehow the dish was bland.  The rice that came with it was soggy - too much water.   The pad see ew noodles were overcooked and clumped up into small cubed bits.  The flavor wasn't bad, but overcooked noodles really ruins a noodle dish.  Judging as these entrees that had decent ratings were not very good I don't think I'll be returning.

They're really slipping now.  With dinner, you get cole slaw - you can "upgrade" to soup or salad for 2.50 more.  Really?  I've never heard of cole slaw being a pre-meal before.  I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimi's.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and there's hardly any onions in it.  The prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasn't the best, but way better than the butter!    The barbeque chicken was ok.  I've had better at diners.  They didn't really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasn't terribly dry...  I don't think I'm coming back to this one.  Nooooo..

I actually just placed an order for pick up.  The place was packed and kind of cramped, but my food was ready as promised right on time.  I got a chicken sandwich and a burger - 19.06, ouch!  The burger was a bit bland.  The meat was pretty good, but just needed a little seasoning.  The onion roll and accompaniments were standard.  The steak fries were definitely done right - not one of them was limp and not crispy.  The spicy chicken sandwich was very good.  I liked this a lot better than the burger.  The coleslaw I got as a side for it though was bland and watery.    All in all, its got a hefty price tag but ingredients are good and food is cooked right.  Nothing a little salt won't fix.  Place gets packed but the service seems very good considering.

AWESOME experience!  One of my cats were starting to act very temperamental, made weird gagging noises before she'd spaz out twisting her neck.  I thought maybe she had some kind of psychiatric issue and was hesitant to bring her in before I can figure out what exactly was wrong.  When I offered her a treat and she went for it tentatively, and immediately acted like I hurt her it was the last straw and I made an appointment.  They were able to see us within an hour.  The staff was very nice and careful around my unhappy cat.  A tech came and held her by the scruff while Dr. Davis did his examination.  Thankfully within minutes he found something sticking out of one of her back teeth.  They sedated her, pulled it out, chipped the tartar that had built up around it and gave her an antibiotic shot that would cover 2 weeks.  All for about $220.  As easy and reasonably priced as it was, I felt terrible for not bringing her in sooner!  They were so nice and expertly handled her.  They explained everything to me before and after the procedure.  I would definitely recommend this hospital!

Ugh, this place is terrible!  It looks good, and it smells good, but it unfailingly ALWAYS disappoints!  I seriously have not had one dish that tasted close to right.  Its salty and very flavorful, but somehow it just tastes off.  I've tried a lot of dishes here too.

We went for happy hour last night and I had the best steak sandwich I've ever had!  The bread is very tasty and chewy.  It actually holds up to the task and doesn't become a soggy mess you're trying to keep together by the end.  The steak wasn't too dry and the bearnaise sauce was also very excellent.  You get perfectly cooked and seasoned fries with it too, all for $8.  This is such a great deal, I can't believe I never did this til last night!  Service was also pretty awesome.  We actually hung out a bit even after the check was taken and they offered us waters.  Very impressed!

They are very bad about stocking items that are on sale.  The last time I shopped, there were no butter, eggs, and chuck roast.  Zero!  This isn't the first time but this is the first time so many of the items were left cleaned out.  Lame.

I'm so glad I found this place!  I've been looking for a good take out place near my home for 2 years now and this will definitely be the one.  I tried 3 different dishes and while there may have been a bit too much green onion or breading here and there, the quality and taste of these dishes are the best I've found in Scottsdale so far.  Even after 4 days of reheating and eating portions of my dinner I still thought it tasted good.  If that tells you anything..  The dishes I got btw were mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork and some kinda panfried fat noodle with everything on top thing.  Prices were a bit on the high side I thought (about 10 avg per dish whether its fried rice, noodle or beef), but I'd rather have this than Panda Express the next time I want Chinese!

The sandwiches are very tasty - I've liked every one that I've tried so far.  The pizza we had last time we were there - not likely will ever be ordered again.  Maybe I'll try a pasta dish next time I'm there.  :)

They say its bar food done right - I'd have to say I agree.  Got the burger and wings - both very solid.  Love the beer choices.  The prices are very reasonable for specialty beer and good bar food.  All in all, I am definitely going back regularly!

Got the combination plate, I'm not very familiar with Middle Eastern food so I'm not sure I'm a good judge.  The gyro meat was a little greasy..  I liked the thing that looked like egg roll and the thing that looked like hush puppies..  Wasn't a huge fan of the thing that looked like dark corn bread and the salad type couscous thing.  The chicken kabob, koobideh and beef kabobs were not very flavorful and slightly burned.  LOVED the pistachio baklavas!  Which is why I'm giving it 4 stars..  :)

The food is awesome!  Everything is perfectly cooked and flavored well.  One of the best pad thai places of the valley.  Prices are typical.  Nice ambiance.   Love the antique type serving wares.  Service is great too.  The place wasn't packed or anything but the food timing was pretty perfect.

I like their happy hour specials.  They're a small family-owned spot in a strip mall which is kind of refreshing in a world of Kabuki, Ra and Stingrays.  I really liked their fish to rice ratio, freshness of the fish, sashimi and sushi offerings, and even some of their more creative offerings weren't bad (I'm just not a huge fan of crazy sushis).  Don't get the teriyaki chicken, its not very good and NOT grilled.  I thought their prices were reasonable and they seem very clean.  They're a bit slow, but they do everything themselves (mom and pop that is) so that's a little expected..  Just relax and enjoy the quiet change.  :)

They're changing their hours to open for lunch!  It might improve their accessibility to the general public that has things to do!  :D  Their crusty bread that they serve is delicious.  It tastes like they put a little extra salt, but the texture and taste is unlike any other bread I've ever had.  The crust is very crusty while the inside is fluffy with lots of air pockets.  The crust for their pizzas are the best I've ever had as well.  Very chewy and great taste.  They do tend to get soggy in the middle so the very tips of the slices can barely hold together when you move in for the bite, but the crust is fantastic.  The toppings are another story.  They're fresh ingredients and you can tell this, however..  I heard the Wiseguy was the most popular one.  It has roasted onion and sausage on it.  Barely edible.  We also got the Sonny Boy and Margherita pizzas with a few toppings added to it.  This is what I learned - the olives and prosciutto are very salty, sausage is tasty and just about as salty as one would expect.  The basil is used sparingly and the arugula is not.  The appetizers were very good, but kind of overpriced.  We got the caprese salad which you can tell the cheese is freshly made that day.  We also got some cheese on sticks that were wrapped with prosciutto on a bed of arugula - that one was fantastic.  You get 2 sticks about 7" long and I think it was $12.  Overpriced, but I would recommend it.  All in all, I enjoyed the experience - hanging out in line from 350 til 5pm when they opened and started seating, meeting the friendly wait staff (not the "hostesses", the down-to-earth wait staff with the t-shirts and aprons), getting close to celebrity (saw the lady from The Practice and Lie to Me - Kelli something - and her husband that was on some kid show that I'm not familiar with AND Mayor Gordon and his family came later), and paying a hefty price for dinner but not really feeling shmucked about it.  I will definitely go back, but this time just getting toppings of my own choosing!

Pretty regular sushi and teppanyaki.  Not a lot of tricks at all with the teppan.  Everything costs 2-3x normal retail cost it seems like.  Salad was decent, though the dressing a bit acidic.  I've had better miso soup, didn't taste authentic at all.  The grilled meats were ready over 10 min before the grilled veggies were.  The dessert wasn't very good - the best thing was the flourless mini cake with lychee creme(?) in the middle.  The mochi ice cream was way worse than the store bought ones - the rice cake was hard and stale tasting due to the ice cream (why reinvent the wheel?).  The sake syrup shot thing just tasted how flowery scents smell.  Just weird.  Definitely not worth the money.  Try a different place!

Its official - my favorite pizza place in Phoenix!  Sometimes it can use a little more cheese, but overall I consistently like all the pizzas I've tried.  Salads are pretty good as well.  Even with the price tag I will return time and again.  Also the fresca crepe dessert is a must try!

DIM SUM!  I was worried when I saw how small the dining area was, but it worked out perfectly since I was starving by the time we arrived.  Immediately we were asked what we wanted to drink (tea is .80 ea), and then all the carts came by.  Each cart had several different dishes on them which helped get us going real fast.  The owner (?) was super friendly and brought us all the sauces we wanted that wasn't on the table.  The servers weren't too pushy or sensitive about it if we refused their dishes which is a plus.  I will definitely go back again, although my coworker wants me to try a different place down the street.  We'll see, so far this is my favorite for dim sum!

I know I only have myself to blame, because I've ate at Flattop Grill in Chicago which is the same concept - except it was like $15 all you can eat whereas this place was a little more.  (Somehow whatever I make at these places doesn't come out very well!)  Anyway, the concept is cool, but its not worth the premium charge they put on the options there.  I'd rather just go to a buffet that has something like this so its optional and its not your whole meal - and you can eat other things that doesn't come out all sucky.  :)

This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..

This is a neat place to take out of towners.  It's off I-17 but very out of the way and dumpy looking from the outside.  Then, surprise - it IS open!    We tried the whole hog heaven which was plenty for 4 people.  We got the St Louis ribs and baby back ribs - both delicious and saucy.  We also got the hot links and beef brisket.  I wasn't a fan of the hot links.  The beef brisket was slightly dry but with a bit of sauce it was quite delicious.    We also got corn and macaroni and cheese as sides.  I wouldn't recommend the corn - its very buttery and overcooked.  Mac and cheese was better, but mostly because its nice against the salty meats.  We also started with the Q-rolls(?) which was beef rolled in pastry material.  The sauce it comes with made it quite tasty as well.  All in all, if you're looking for a nice, sit-down bbq restaurant in Phoenix, this one's hard to beat!

I hate the set up.  You walk in, never having been there before and its just a chaotic mess of things and lines of people everywhere.  There are no signs to help you.  You walk into the restaurant part and wonder why all the servers(?) are ignoring you.  People that seem to be customers are waiting their own tables, and people that seem to work there seem to be doing some of it too.  WTH is going on??  So you have to stand in line at the bakery looking type counter to order.  The menu's a bit hard to read so you stand at the cake side if you want pizza to see what you want, then get in line at the other end of the counter.  Order up and they yell your name in the restaurant part but there's no way you can hear what name they're yelling over the music.  So you kind've sit for about 20min and when you think you should be up, you check every time they yell anything.....  The DMV has little flashy sign things that seem to do the job......  That said, the shop's quirky and random in the stuff they stock.  Lots of different beer brands available.  Not sure about their wine selection.  The bakery stuff looks great, but seem pricey.  All this stuff is a plus in my book (minus the wine selection).  The pizza's pretty good.  Slightly soggy crust in the middle but that's tough to do.  The outer crust is chewy and pretty good.  We got the Gladiator - the pepperoni was good but I didn't like the sausage (tasted like.. rye?).    I'll probably definitely go back.  I don't like the trendster-y "you know or you don't, we're not putting up signs" thing, and the chaotic way of knowing about and retrieving your order.  The crust is good and the pricing isn't bad.  I'd like to check out the happy hour and definitely something from the bakery case.  Also, I have to join in - hate the parking situation!

Seems like every time I go back I get less enthused.  I don't know why I thought this time would be different,  maybe my expectations were that it'd be easier cuz I'm just getting stuff to go..  I managed to get a spot in the tight parking space and made my way through the awkwardly tight space finding myself walking probably too close to people and their food sitting at tables out front but there's just no other way to do it.  Then there's the awkward 'where's the line' and then the awkward shuffle where other people are either trying to find the end of the line or just trying to squeeze by and you're trying to exhibit with posturing that you are in line without coming off like a jerk.    This time I grab my salad out of the case and get directed down the way to the cashier on the other side of the pastry case.  I order my cookie and barbeque chicken sandwich over a bunch of dishes ready to go to their owners which I find kind of disgusting.. I'm glad I'm getting mine to go.    After killing about ten minutes with my salad still in my hand with a cookie in a sleeve precariously sliding around on top my name is finally called.  The girl gestures to the box that is to be mine and promptly turns away to face the kitchen.  Why?  To look at her phone..  So I had to stand there another 2 minutes waiting for either the cashier helping another customer to be done or the girl to finally turn to see that I haven't left yet.  I ease on closer and closer to the other side of the counter over these 2 minutes and am just about to go for it when she finally looks up from her phone to see me and I finally get my bag.  Why do they think 2 boxes and a slippery sleeve doesn't warrant a bag??  It's not til I'm out of the parking lot that I realized I don't have a fork or any napkins.  This place takes self service to a weird space between 'yes' and 'no' - some things are available for the taking and some things aren't.  I'll tell you what though, you get better service at Taco Bell.  So maybe this place is too hip for me or I just expect to much.  I was definitely ready to give up on this establishment altogether with a defiant "I am never going back".  Then I had some of the cookie.  I usually don't like the salty cookie trend but this chocolate chip with french salt was pretty darn good.  Even with the headache of dealing with this place and the $3 price tag I think I would at least consider going back.  The sandwich was ok - the bread is good, the barbeque sauce is very good, the chicken only covered about half the sandwich but it was moist enough.  The salad was gritty with dirt so I'll probably not do that again.    Maybe next time I'll find nothing to go back for, but til then I just might for that cookie.  Definitely not on a weekend though.

I've always found Oregano's pizza decent.  Between Tombstone and their thin crust, it would be a toss up that usually ended up with me preheating the oven.  A friend convinced me to try it again saying that their pasta is much better than their pizza.  I got Mama's Sausage and Peppers.  It was actually pretty good.  How do you mess that up, right?  It was a little confusing when two different people came by to ask if I wanted parmesan cheese on top, the top was already covered with parmesan cheese....  The notorious star of the meal however was the lasagna.  It was hands down the worst lasagna I've ever had.  There was maybe one layer of pasta, a layer of mozzarella on top and a little cheese in the middle, but the bulk of it was several layers of overworked ground meat(?).  It's almost like a huge nasty meatball with some sauce and cheese in different spots that you found in the back of the fridge.  I was going to give 3 stars until later on in the meal I tried a piece of meat that was hanging out in the middle of the plate that didn't have any cheese or sauce to hide behind.  That little morsel of meat lost this place another star.

The plating here is beautiful, and for once they taste just about as good as they look here!  We got the Groupon deal which is a 3 course dinner for two people for about $80.  This is a ridiculous deal and if I'd known how good this place is, I would have gotten 2!  For the first course we got the rainbow ceviche and the lobster one.  Rainbow was phenomenal - yellowfish, tuna all stacked in a little cylindrical pile with slices of jalapeno and some watercress on top.  The magic though is in the citrus liquid that fills the bowl.  The taste changes the longer it sits there - if you're a fan of sushi, you will probably like this dish.  The lobster escabeche was slightly different - poached lobster in the middle and fried avocado and yucca chips in a broth of its own.  This one was pretty good, however, the lobster was a bit overcooked and I didn't think the chips really added anything.  Round one goes to the rainbow ceviche!  I got the kobe skirt steak which I thought was seasoned beautifully.  It's cooked well but is still pretty juicy and tender so I didn't mind.  The tomato topping was a nice vacation to renew the dish, but very subtle.  The potato slices with guacamole were decent.  My friend got the lamb cutlets which arrived kind of cold to the table which he was not happy about.  The chimichurri that comes with it is also very sweet which he didn't appreciate.  I thought it was a nice mix of flavors, though the portion wasn't very much since half the lamb cutlet is bone and fat and you only get 2 per plate.  Definitely not a gut buster, but delicious.  For dessert we got to try the chocolate cigar which had a fun presentation.  The cigar is very rich and chocolaty, and the cappuccino gelato that came with it was delicious.  The crema catalana was more my speed with a little creme brulee/flan type mold on a bed of berries and fruit syrup accompanied by a spoonful of coconut tapioca.    The complexities of these dishes are tasty and fun - as you incorporate different combinations of bites you get a totally different flavor experience.  The grounds are immaculate and well designed without feeling too stuffy.  The service was excellent and very attentive.  All in all, this was a very positive experience for us and though the price tag precludes it from being a regular stop we will very much enjoy frequenting this restaurant for any happy occasion in the future.

This is NOT a good venue for large groups.  The largest table is in the part of the patio that has no misters on it.  I'm not sure if everyone else had this problem, but it was disgusting how many flies came to eat when the food came.  We even asked if we can rearrange some tables at the side of the lounge area (empty at the time) that would've been perfect for our group and they wouldn't let us.  All the tables inside are small booths of pretty much the same size.  Definitely NOT the place to have your party in the summer!  They don't even fill your glasses with ice water regularly.

Latin fusion?  It was good Mexican food..  a bit fancier I spose...  We had the fish tacos (tilapia) and nachos.  Nachos were standard (its hard to mess it up right?), the fish tacos were very good.  Nothing very crazy different here.    The next time we went we perused the dinner menu and got the FB pasta dish and the short rib.  The short ribs were very good, not overly fatty, easily came apart.  And they were even better reheated.  I got the creamed corn and the corn bread casserole as sides - interesting and pretty tasty.  The pasta dish was kinda oily, but the portion is pretty big.  I wasn't a big fan and I'm sure it was very "expensive" calorie-wise.  This place is very tucked away and "cozy" meaning 9 tables and a bar.  There are a couple more tables on the patio area, but in the room that is it.  They share the bathroom with the rest of the complex.  Not complaining, I've seen places like these in California and such.  Just wanted to be clear since you can fit 50 people sometimes in "cozy" places and this place definitely cannot.  Its also in kind of a bad location with confusing parking arrangements.  All in all, the food is pretty good, but the prices are too high to justify getting dinner there.  (The dinner entrees were about 25 each).  I would go back for lunch or happy hour since the food is pretty good and the items on these menus are priced pretty appropriately.  I can think of a lot of other places that would be worth 60+ money for dinner..

I'm so glad after going to so many terrible restaurants recently that Tarbell is not just hype!  The portions are pretty tiny.. but every bite I tried of every dish was pretty much Italian as good as it gets.  I had the ribbon pasta with sausage and spinach.  Also tried the bolognese.  Also tried the chicken.  The bread pudding I wasn't a huge fan of.    I can't wait to come back - definitely a special occasion restaurant of choice for people who appreciate good food!

How do you mess up bulgogi??  It tasted like they cooked it and then rinsed it in water.  I asked the waitress to taste it and her response - "tastes fine to me, I didn't get any complaints from any other customers".  The kalbi tasted pretty good, but the quality of the meat was not good - a bit too fatty.  The pork bulgogi wasn't bad, but didn't care for the charred bits.  The jap chae was a bit over sauced.  Edible, but a bit gummy tasting.  The lunch special is a pretty good deal - comes with a few cali rolls that are decent, a dumpling and a little bit of salad.  If I'm in the area and I really need some korean food I would consider it but otherwise I'll plan to trek it to Mesa.  :\

We ordered a steak sandwich and the raspberry chipotle boneless wings everybody was raving about.  The steak in the sandwich had no flavor, I've had better steak at a chinese buffet.  The bread was kind of nasty..  almost stale but I think its just how it comes?  The tots were the thing we liked, but how do you screw that up.  The wings were shrivelled - kind of like chinese food in a way where they batter and fry up chicken pieces that are sliced thin and then cover with sauce.  The ends were dried up chicken and batter that were more like jerky than wings.  The sauce was creative, but definitely not the next ranch or honey mustard.  Maybe a little more of a spicy kick would make it better.  All in all, won't go back.  Mostly because we don't live in the area so the next time we're there, we'll try something else.  If it was in my neighborhood, I might go back for happy hour.  Their drinks looked pretty cheap and I wouldn't feel so bad about the wings if I'm paying half price and drunk.

The whole show is pretty much run by 1 woman, but the service never seems to suffer.  The food is solid, and very consistent.  I find that I am always coming back to this place.  The prices are very good, about 6-10 per dish/lunch combo.  It is a small scale operation so last time when I went with a friend that wanted potstickers, it was not available.  All in all, I'll still come back.  :)

I'd been meaning to try this place forever.  I think I was craving thai food so I ordered Pad thai and pad see ew.  Not the best I've had..  I wouldn't order these here.  Maybe their chinese food is better?  They said the owners were Chinese...

Love the prices and for once its reminiscent of Chinese food you find in Chicago!  Some dishes are a bit salty and I'm sure they use some MSG but if you want some good Chinese food try this place!!

We tried the pig dip sandwich and the salmon flatbread.  The flatbread and bread for the sandwich is made in house and you can tell.  The flatbread is actually very fluffy and more like pizza dough than other flatbread dishes seem to be.  I'd definitely try a different topping arrangement next time, the salmon is a bit much to make a whole meal out of.  It was also less smoked than we expected.  The pig sandwich was very good, and the fries were actually decent despite appearance.  Presentation overall was very nice as well.  I would happily return to this fine establishment!

Had the bibim nangmyun and kalbi.  The kalbi was too sweet.  The nangmyun was ok.    I liked the decor a lot and the side dishes were good (kimchi was too salty though).  Their pricing kind of gets me though - its pretty much $10 for everything from dumplings (which is usually considered an appetizer) to soondubu.  If they're pricing premium, all the food better be perfect - and it wasn't.    Also, its kind of weird that they drop off the check and then you have to go up and pay at the register.  I've seen this at Ihop, but never really at a korean restaurant.  Weird...  I think I'll stick with Hodori..

I almost want to rate it poorly to keep it to myself!  They just have salads, sandwiches and baked goods.  I had the egg whites, bacon, arugula, pesto sandwich.  It came with sliced bananas with candied almonds(?) and honey on top.  It was a little bit oily because of the pesto, but I really liked how the sandwich was put together and stayed together.  We also had the chicken pesto sandwich which was also delicious and came with a mini cookie.  It was cold which I thought was surprising but good nonetheless.  We also tried the apple pie which had slightly too much sugar but still the best pie we've bought in Phoenix so far.  Its right in the corner of the complex so it's hard to find but I'd definitely try to make my way over!

I finally checked it out and I think its my least favorite of the fox restaurants.  Its like the little caesars of fancy pizza.  I'll actually take little caesars next time since i can get more than double the food...  Upon further reflection, it tastes kind've like grade school cafeteria pizza..

Butterfish Takahi was as great as ever!  Also tried a fancy roll this time and sashimi platter.  Its AWESOMELY FRESH.  I was actually impressed by the freshness of the fish.  Its expensive, the furniture is uncomfortable and something about the place is just douchey or something, but the fish is fresh and it tastes very good.  I would like to go back, but need a willing victim that doesn't mind a weird atmosphere and uncomfortable seating.  :/

Their steak is very good, however, you have to order it one step less cooked than you like it because the plate is so hot that it continues to cook the meat while its on the plate.  But the flavor is great, as well as sides - we had mashed potatoes and mushroom.  Also broccoli but that was rather plain.  The chocolate layer cake tasted/felt frozen and was not very good.  I would pass on both of these, but otherwise, a very solid steakhouse.

Cheesecake is delicious for one without a graham crust.  The fried ravioli isn't what I would order, I just don't think it was worth the calories.  Chilean bass is nothing special, but the steak as always is pretty consistent.  I love the coffee here.

My porterhouse was too salty to enjoy very much of and I forgot my own tip about ordering one step less cooked than liked because the plate will continue cooking the meat.  It was also a lot hotter than usual so it kept spattering me with hot butter.  I think I prefer the ribeye or the filets.  The ribeye has more flavor and wasn't salted as much.  The filets are thicker so the seasoning evens out better.    Mushrooms were delicious as always.  The twice baked potato was a bit too salty as well.  Calamari was average, but hardly battered and came with an unappetizing sauce with a thick hardened skin.  That was a disappointing performance for a restaurant at this level that is usually very consistently good.  Cheesecake is different now!  It has a graham crust and comes with a delicious creme fraiche.  The cheesecake is more creamy and dense, though I prefer fluffy.  Still overall it was a decent dessert.  It'll still be one of my favorite restaurants and my go-to for impressing people, but I'm hoping today's dinner isn't a sign of declining standards.

I'm not sure what all these people are talking about, maybe I'm a fluke, maybe she's better at coloring.  I've had short cuts before, and they never looked this crappy.  I even went back to her to fix and got my 2nd worst hair cut ever.  Its a shame because she seems so nice and I really wanted to like it.  But seriously, worst

The gyro is good, the fries are ok but borderline salty, and I like that they give you the tzaziki on the side.  The only bad thing is the price - 5.95 for the gyro, 7.95 for the combo.  I'll go back, but I'll always look for a cheaper alternative.

I have no idea why so many people go to this place.  Everything's so expensive, they never have any great deals and the food is mediocre at best.  My friend and I had 1 plate of nachos (appetizer) and 3 beers and the total came out to 30 dollars.  On top of this, the gratuity was added and the waitress didn't say anything so we accidentally tipped her more on top so we paid almost 50 dollars!  She could've let us know if she wasn't so greedy..  I tried to complain on the website but the only thing you can do is give them information to set up a party.  What a rackett!

Its pretty decent.  Good flavor on the meat.  The bread can be a little chewier and well.. better.  But not too shabby at all.  Sweet potato fries are good though more slivery than a fry.  Not sure about the fry sauce that everyone raved about.  It might taste better on a regular fry.  Anyway, love the idea of the condiment fridge where guests can help themselves to peppers and such.  Would definitely return.

They have a LOT of choices on the menu, but if they can't even wash the lettuce right for the lettuce wraps I shudder to think what ends up in their burgers.  All in all, mediocre food and not worth forming a clod of dirt in your intestines.

I tried the pad thai here since that's what I always get to gauge a Thai restaurant.  The dish was slightly bland, a bit too sweet and not much else.  I did not taste any lime or cilantro, or really anything that reminded me of Pad Thai..  The price is the same as any other Thai restaurant, but I think I'd prefer any other Thai restaurant...

This place is as good as it gets!!  Love the prices - they're actually reasonable!  The food is pretty good and high quality.  The beer and wine selection is awesome.  AND they don't feel the need to blast the music - you can actually appreciate the quiet chatter of  the room.  Live music some days.    LOVE this place!!

I gotta say, I really am a fan of this little shop in Old Town.  I like their topping combinations of ready made pizzas and I like how the crust is very crispy and chewy at the same time.  I don't think its the best pizza I've ever tasted, but they really come through for you late nights drinking in Old Town.

This place is disgusting!  The place looks ok, the decor looks fine and everything looks good at the beginning.  I ordered a carafe of green apple infused sake.  Both me and the friend I was with poured our first little shot when we realized the bottoms must've been full of dust!  There was little pieces of lint floating all inside - and the shot glass fits only like a tablespoon!  At the bottom, there was a little brown streak that I wiped out (I was not going to ask for another dusty shot glass).  BTW, the sake tasted like water and green apple mixer with a touch of sake - it is the weakest drink I've ever had!  The carafe which is normally 10 dollars, 5 at happy hour poured 5 little teaspoonfuls of sake.  How do you mess up wasabi and soy sauce??  The rolls we ordered came out fine but somehow the soy sauce had like no flavor.  Do they water the soy sauce down??!?!  I normally put a lot of wasabi, but this is the first time I put the whole pile in and barely got a tingle in my nose.    Oh, and I had to wipe down my little place too because there seemed to be old food on it (it felt gritty and there was a piece of dried up lettuce on it).  The table probably was never wiped down because it was sticky as well.  This place SUCKS, and I would never go there again.

It doesn't help that the evening ended with me telling the manager/owner exactly what was wrong with all the food that I had tried there and him walking back in shaking his head in a surprisingly unprofessional manner.  He tried to tell me this food wins awards every year somewhere...  I definitely did not get anything that would win awards.  Oh, and although I pointed out specific problems in technique, he blew my issues off as being just "a matter of taste".  Mind you, I was the only asian in that establishment - kitchen, and otherwise.  Korean tacos - there is NOTHING Korean about these tacos.  We don't use shredded meat for one, its way too salty and all I tasted that had a Korean link was Soy Sauce (maybe some brown sugar?).  Owner/manager guy said of course its Korean, it has Korean spices in it.  I don't think he knows anything about Korean cuisine....  California rolls - how do you mess these up?  I guess by not putting anything but crabmeat and a tiny bit of cucumber that was poorly matchsticked.  These were so bland, I ended up putting some of the Korean taco meat filling on top and added some of the shell crumbled up for texture.  Eel/Dragon roll - the Dragon roll had one thick slice of avocado across 3 pieces of the roll.  The eel was over done in sauce that tasted almost burnt - its either not seasoned right or over caramelized.  Of course this same sauce is found on the Eel sushi.  The Peanut butter Jellyfish roll - this was actually not too bad.  Nothing to write home about, but not completely wrong like everything else.  I put pretty much all the wasabi we received into about half the saucer of soy sauce and could barely taste it.  Is it fake?  The rolls were also sliced unevenly, which is a fine detail that you appreciate at good sushi restaurants.  They were also not rolled tightly enough, so everything fell apart pretty much as soon as you grabbed it.  All in all, never again.

Solid persian food.  Have the beef platter - it comes with some kind of ground beef and sirloin on skewers.  Served on a bed of saffron rice.  Its all very delicious, and even better the next day.  $20/plate, but you can share between 2 people and be full.  Love the complimentary pita bread!

I passed by it for almost a year thinking, man that place looks wacky but if it stays in business it must be good.  So I finally made it in and boy am I glad!  Their food is very good.  Meat is very smoky without feeling too dry or tasting burnt - well, it is a little dry but with a little extra sauce its perfect.  Their greens are the best I've ever had.  Its salty, but I think that's part of the appeal of soul food isn't it?  I dunno, this place is pretty tasty.  I hope they don't raise the prices though!

We got to taste a bunch of little dishes before a large platter of sushi/sashimi came.  Definitely the way to dine!  Ranged from not that great but edible to pretty dang awesome.  The sushi rolls were a bit densely rolled I thought so it was just shy of rice cake consistency but the combinations were fantastic.  So I am a fan.  Yay~

Tried the Jewish sliders and the corned beef sandwich with coleslaw and potato salad respectively.  The sliders were very delicious.  I would definitely recommend them.  3 came with the order and I took the 3rd home.  The corned beef sandwich was also pretty good, though I can't say I can tell one from being better or worse than another since its pretty much all salty meat.  Tasted about right..  I thought it was supposed to have 1000 island dressing on it though which I didn't taste.    The salads were both sweeter than typical.  I didn't mind it though.  The potato salad was better I thought, more flavor.  Cole slaw tasted slightly watery.  I can't wait to try some of their baked goods.  They had some streusel sitting out for guests and I tried something with chocolate and another that tasted of cranberry-orange.  The cranberry-orange one was delicious.  I would have gotten some for home if I wasn't so full.

By far the best bbq I've had in Phoenix so far.  Yes, I've been to Honey BBQ, Famous Daves, Stacy's (unfortunately not in the running.. sniff!), Dickie's BBQ Pit, etc.  So the pulled pork by itself is eh, and the bbq sauce is like eh, but then you put them together and its AWESOME!  It makes you scratch your head..  The bun is very tasty and goes with the pork well too.  The corn bread is on the dry side with bits of corn in it.  Not bad.  The BBQ nachos I would not recommend although you do get a heaping pile of tasty bits.  Also would not recommend the spicy fries, but I hear their mac and cheese and various other sides are better.  But I'm definitely going back to find that perfect endless side to go with my pulled pork sandwich.  Maybe get a rack on the side too!  ;)

We kicked off Restaurant Week here and had a great time.  The ambiance is great and they have music that can be a little loud but definitely not as obnoxious and distracting as some other Scottsdale establishments.  For first course we had spinach salad and the lamb slider (says plural on the menu, but you only get one).  The slider didn't have a ton of flavor that I like.  It was complex but on the bland side and I don't like the taste of rye..  The spinach salad was great and love the little fried balls of cheese.  Second course my friend chose the Honey-spiced drumsticks with mac n cheese, which portion wise was huge, and I got the pork chop with stuffed jalapenos, less thrilling portion wise.  The drumsticks were pretty good but my favorite was the mac and cheese.  The stuffed jalapenos were good but I didn't enjoy the pork chops so much.  It was sweet, and not too dry but somehow not very exciting.  For dessert my friend chose the apple cobbler a la mode which was great although it was very thin (it was very wide and thin, so lots of crumble and less filling).  I picked the upside down pineapple farina cake.  I didn't know what farina was, and still really don't, but it tastes like a sweet corn muffin.  Not a huge fan after the pineapple ran out.  All in all, the atmosphere is pretty awesome and its cool that you can see the kitchen.  The service is great yet not overbearing.  The Restaurant week menu is worth a try although the portions seem uneven.  The passion for food is there, just hidden or steam lost at times.

They have such a quaint set-up.  Farm to kitchen theme, the dining area is outdoors in a country courtyard setting.  They have all kinds of baked goods as well which is a huge plus.  We tried the brownie which was great and the apple cranberry cobbler.  The cobbler was very pricey but pretty good.  I will probably make my own on that one next time..  The Asiago chicken sandwich was delicious!  Artichoke hearts and dressing and chicken on foccacia bread.  Kind of sloppy to eat but well worth it.  The steak sandwich was also solid, but not worth the $10.  Maybe if they put a little bit more sauce on it, it'd be less bland?  Overall this is a nice little spot to eat when the weather is comfortable.  I'd say its worth the upcharge only if you're eating there.

This is my new favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I made a reservation online and they had a table all set with some pappadam and sauces and waters.  Never had such great service like that before!  The serverware in general were very exotic and noticeably increased my enjoyment of dinner.  We got the chicken tikka masala and a lamb dish (just ask for their most popular one, it had tomato based sauce).  The meats were very tender, not overly dry and the sauces were perfect.  They weren't overly skimpy on the meat like some other places too.  The garlic naan was great with the entrees.  The prices are a bit high so I would recommend getting a Groupon if available.  Lunch isn't so bad for pricing but I'm not sure about their portion size.

The place has so much potential, there are so many great options on the menu and the pricing seemed reasonable.  However, nothing was right..  The complimentary bread they served was pretty good, but the butter had no taste.  It tasted a lot better when I added a bit of salt to it.    We got the nachos to start and added the spicy chicken - the chicken was not so much spicy but VERY salty.  Everything else was average - chips with shredded melted cheese that wasn't melted all the way through in some areas, a sprinkling of tomatoes, olives and jalapenos.  The plating was cute with little tortilla chip cups to hold the sour cream, salsa and guacamole.  But I definitely wouldn't get the chicken again.  The caesar salad was pretty good, but wasn't tossed well and the pieces of lettuce varied widely in size.  The dressing was pretty good though.  We also got the prime rib with loaded potato as a side.  We asked for medium but it came out medium well - no pink whatsoever, no juice.  The horseradish that comes with was straight up grated root, and the au jus tasted too strong - like brown gravy.  We added shrimp to our plate - the shrimp was actually pretty bland although it looked great.  The size of the shrimp was great, just needed a bit of salt.  Actually we started eating the shrimp with little bits of chicken from the nachos to even them out a bit.  For desert we got the icecream pie - mocha ice cream on chocolate crust with almond shavings and syrup on top.  It was decent, but the ice cream had a bit of freezer burn feel to it.  It was detracting, but not terrible.  All in all, this place had all the makings of our new favorite steakhouse and happy hour place but it disappointed every step of the way.  The patio is nice, but the misters are either spraying right on you or not at all, the music on the patio competing with the music from the mall speakers will drive you crazy and the service is very slow.

What an improvement!!  I did not think the food was very good the last 2 times I went (the last time I didn't bother to update).  Tried the happy hour again to find the chicken nachos much more edible - the chicken is still a bit salty but its on the border of salty and best seasoned chicken ever.  The mushroom cap appetizer is delicious, ESPECIALLY with some lemon squeezed on top.  The wings off the bar menu were delicious as well - 3 peppers or something, so its a low lingering hot that I do enjoy.  I think I will definitely come back.  Not sure for the pricier food, but the happy hour and apps are definitely much improved.

I've been here a few times, I can't believe I never wrote a review.  Their gyro sandwiches are solid.  They really stuff the sandwich and its nice because its not super greasy.  I've had their steak sandwich too - its weird how they package it kind of like an open faced sandwich, but it's decent.  It's chopped bite sized pieces of sirloin.  They season it pretty well but its a tiny bit tougher than I like.  The fries are decent though I like them crispier.  Everything tastes pretty fresh.  I kind of prefer the greek salad which they do a great job with, and you get a lot.    The baklava is also a wonderful addition to your meal.  I wouldn't get the chicago hot dog or anything, but other items are priced well so you get a pretty good value for your money.  The food is freshly made, seasoned well, and portioned nicely.  The wait is a bit long if you don't phone in your order ahead of time but this place is definitely a try if you're in the neighborhood.

Definitely a drunk-food bar.  The burgers were decent, but not seasoned well and pre-pressed patties of meat.  The onion rings should be cut into smaller slices - I think each onion is cut into 4 slices so they're gigantic.  The chocolate shake was pretty good, but the vanilla one was mediocre at best.

I went with a bunch of friends so I got to try a little of everything.    The fried cheese curds were very good.  I don't usually like curds but I couldn't stop eating these, maybe its the quality of the curds.  Very simply seasoned with salt and pepper.    The dates stuffed with chorizo and cheese were interesting and good.  Served on a bed of arugula which went well with them, though I would've needed more of the greens if it was all me.    Grilled baguette was interesting - came with a bowl of oil with a roasted garlic bulb.  You dig out a piece of garlic with the spoon and kind of smear it on the bread.  Not too bad, but I think it could've used some tomatoes or something..  I prefer plain old garlic bread.    The chicken and waffles were good - the chicken was awesome and I could do without the waffles so they evened out to good.  The waffles were crumbly and I didn't like the seasoning on them.  The mac and cheese we ordered with lobster.  The bites with lobster were good, the rest was just bland.    The skirt steak was pretty good.  Came with mashed potatoes and had gravy and mushrooms on top.    All in all, the food is creative and fancy but more down to earth along with the price.  I would recommend taking a date here to try new things without breaking the bank.  The decoration and atmosphere is modern, clean with a bit of antiquety.  The drink specials are surprisingly good for a restaurant like this.  Will definitely return.

The atmosphere is nice, but not at all fancy/stuffy which is a plus.  Service was great, though it doesn't seem like there was a lot of staff.    We got the wings, white cheddar cheese curds and fried shrimp.  They all came out pretty quickly and hit the spot.    All in all, great service, great prices (happy hour includes 1/2 off appetizers and $2 beers), and great non-pretentious atmosphere.

The menu is interesting.  There were some good ideas - this place is actually trying, not just doing the tried and true eggs and bacon crap.    I got the sirloin burger (forget what its called..  Old Town burger?  Something..) for breakfast.  They had to double check to make sure but they say they usually do the lunch items for breakfast upon request.  It had horseradish mayo and coleslaw, as well as the typical lettuce and tomato.  Very good.  Another great idea - you can get half sweet potato and half plain fries as a side!  (Variety potato or something?)  It was just perfect for me because its such a battle choosing between the two, and then halfway through I wish I had some of the other variety.  :)  My friend got the steak omelet.  Not bad.  Not too much you can do with that I guess.  I was so excited about my breakfast that I didn't pay much attention to it...  but the proportions were surprisingly good for the price.  The menu items look fancy, but the prices are pretty average so one would assume the portions will compensate and be "just right" (think Cafe Zu Zu).  But I was happy with the portions at this place.    I will likely return when I'm in the mood for something special that's not too crazy.

I think I really like this place a lot.  Love the portions - update to my previous review, you get way more food here than Cafe Zu Zu!  And love that you can get lunch items a little early.  Very friendly wait staff.    Happy hrs are another story, their appetizers aren't very good.  Had the pretzels (got "stale" pretty quick, not 1 bit of salt on top and the sauces are watery), chicken nachos (bland and very mediocre at best, how do you mess up nachos??), and meatball something or other (that one wasn't bad, but maybe if they made the bread pieces crisper and didn't stick it in the sauce so it wouldn't get all soggy).  So stick with breakfast and lunch items and its not too bad at all~

There are no pens so bring one if you think you'll need one.  Be prepared for at least 3 people in line ahead of you no matter what time of day.  One lady told me they didn't have any tape at the post office to tape up the flat rate box I got from the display and tried to sell me tape from their little store.  I just went down to the unmanned counter and taped up my box with the tape that was sitting there as I waited in line patiently.  I can't believe she'd lie to my face to sell me tape or send me home.  The Asian guy at least will be patient and honest with you.

Our group was separated and while we were trying to figure out what's going on and figure out a way to get in (half of us were already in, but the other half was 10 min late) we were shuffled from one line to the next, one hallway to the other.  But the cherry on top was a napoleon syndrome bouncer man that literally wanted me to stand on the other side of him while we were all trying to have a conversation.  He was very rude, saying to my friend, "your friend is about to get herself kicked out in a minute" referring to me.  I hate people with a tiny bit of authority power tripping/bullying people and will never come back to this place on principal.  Hakasan is way better anyway.  I'm only adding a star (for a total of 2) because its actually a nice set up and pretty fun usually.

I took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu with a friend.  Between the two of us, we got the french onion soup, calamari frites, chicken, salmon, creme brulee and bread pudding.  The French onion soup was pretty good, but nothing special.  The calamari frites were very creative - had greens on top, a tangy citrus sauce, and some fish eggs on the side.  Mix it all together in the right proportions and its just awesome!  The entrees were all good, but was a let down after the calamari dish.  They were both very flavorful but just not as creative.    The deserts were very nice.  Nothing too creative there but also done right.  My friend did say he hated bread pudding, but he tried this one and liked it if that tells you anything.  All in all, the prix fixe was worth it, but if I was paying retail I wouldn't be so sure.

It's fun and interesting.  I enjoyed the experience, but I thought the food wasn't that great.  They're all interesting, but like all things you're not going to like it all.  I thought the frog leg pho was a little syrupy (too simmered down?) and the frog legs were overcooked.  The baby octopus dish was very good, as well as the quail.  The japanese potato salad was good, but wasn't impressive - its a side dish at Korean restaurants and its free!  The quail egg was a nice touch.    Like I said, the food ranges from good to very good - but its really the experience you're paying for.

Disappointed!  From the Yelp rating and the looks of the place I thought it was a diamond in the rough.  This could be my neighborhood go-to pizza joint, I thought!  There were some questionable comments in the reviews but I thought maybe if I get the carryout, it is better than the slices served there?  The pizza was underwhelming.  Although the toppings were good, sauce and crust was ok, it was very much like a homemade copycat version of Tombstone pizza.  However, at 2.50 vs 18 per pie, might as well stock up on the frozen version.  The chicken wings were pretty soggy and had lots of thick skin on it.  If you like that kind of thing, go for it.  Me, I would rather not.  I wish I could have liked it a little better, they seemed very nice and I like local businesses.  :/

This place is way over priced for regular breakfast food.  Might as well go to Denny's for half the price.  Even the bacon (namesake) was not even thick cut bacon.  It wasn't burnt I guess..  And why do they have hershey bags everywhere?  I didn't see any chocolate on the menu...  Oh, and they have a strict lunch can only be ordered after 11(?) policy.  It was 1040 when we ordered...  that's pretty harsh.

I used to love this place.  I'd always get the three meat plate which included a strip of korean ribs, maybe korean type beef(?) and a barbeque boneless skinless chicken thigh.  They would all be served on a bed of steamed cabbage with some rice and a bit of macaroni salad that somehow worked with it all.  I haven't been in months but it seems like something is different.  The meats just don't have the same flavor.  The korean ribs were overcooked and the marinade for all three just wasn't right.  There were also little patches of saltiness which is weird.  The cabbage had some grit in it which makes me worry about the cleanliness of the food.  The only thing that seemed to be the same was the macaroni salad - but that used to be the worst thing on the plate.  I'm so disappointed in this place.  It'd be edible with a bunch of hot sauce and if you plow through some of the grit, but might as well go to panda express next door.  :/

Where do I start?  The awkward entryway and therefore entrance and seating portion of dinner??  We get seated at one of the high tops near the door, and then NOTHING for about 15 min.  We see another couple walk up and grab a couple menus for themselves.  Then a waitress comes and asks us what we'd like to drink - 2 waters.  But we were actually ready to order... should've grabbed the opportunity but we thought we'd see her more often now that we officially had a waitress.  She drops off the waters and before the glass hits the table she's turned away and walking.  We don't see her for another 15 min.  We were debating whether we should just leave when she comes to see if we're ready to order with a halfhearted apology about being hung up somewhere out there.  Whatever.  We actually get our food shortly after that, the wait was way shorter than getting them the order in the first place.    We got the grilled wings for an extra dollar which we thought would be healthier, but turns out they both fry and grill them so now you get charred and extra dry wings.  Goody.  The burger was decent, except they had pockets of super seasoned meat throughout.  So disappointing!  The fries were actually decent but I won't be going back for fries.  Sorry.

Its fancy and culinarily exciting.  But I found that most of the creativity resulted in me wishing I had the perfectly ordinary thing.  We came here for my birthday and got the spinach salad and the Smokey pizza.  The salad wasn't bad at all, but I did not like the pizza very much at all.  The crust wasn't bad, but one of the ingredients (maybe the arugula?) made our teeth feel sticky and had a weird bitter taste.  Maybe it was the cheese?  Ack, I never had to push myself that hard to take bites of pizza before.  For dessert we got the tiramisu and balsamic strawberry cheesecake (a birthday indulgence).  The portion sizes were on the small side and they each had a weird (fancy) twist to them that kind of hurt the taste of the dessert overall.  It was different and interesting, but sometimes you just want to enjoy a good dessert and this wasn't it.  All in all, I might go back and try a regular pepperoni pizza and a different dessert IF I had a good coupon or they were having a special deal of some kind.

Wth, our water and diet Pepsi glasses sat empty for like an hour.  Tried three times to ask for a refill and some nachos and she walks away every time.   Finally I'm ticked off and she asks if I'd like a refill.  I say yes and can we get.... Ignored again!  Either she's deaf or terrible at her job!

This place was fine for my 2003 Ford escape, but i can't trust it with my new Lexus because one time the brush fell off or something.  I heard a loud thunk and they stopped the wash.  I should have gotten out, but it was dripping everywhere and i had other things to do.  Later I realized my paint was cracked in the back, no noticeable dent but my car must've been hit pretty hard.  Beware!

Somehow their food seems fresher, possibly cleaner?  I do see flies buzzing around all the time though..  I've tried their shrimp tacos - kind've on the spicier side which was unexpected.  The burritos are grilled.  They're about $6 which is kind've hefty for what it is.  Their nachos are actually pretty good, but the containers they use (or something) makes the chips soggy and feel stale.  Do not order a Coke or Pepsi beverage if you can help it - its just a can...  unless you get one of the fancy bottles on display.  All in all, its slightly more for seemingly cleaner/fresher Mexican food.  Not sure why they give you all those salsas, I really only like 1 of them...

Yah, I get the creepy thing from the employees thing but really they're pretty nice.  It is a little odd I guess..  Unfortunately this location is so close to my house its the most convenient grocery store by me.  They don't carry a lot of "fancy" things like fennel, lemongrass, etc.  Definitely a pretty basic store.  The meat department is also terrible about marking and stocking items that are on sale that week.  On the plus side, they have a clearance section that sometimes has things that are fun to try or candy.

I thought I'd reviewed this place before - it would have been a 5 star rating.  The customer service was ridiculously awesome, so great that we thought maybe they had hidden a microphone under the table.  The food was delicious and especially in this area the customer service was something that was very refreshing.  We should never have gone back!  It can't be helped but be disappointing after such a perfect experience.  This time it was Sunday evening.  Sure the service was there but it was the same as everywhere else where you're rushed about, pressured to get drinks, pressured to order appetizers and almost eye-rolled when you just want water and an entree.  It is 2014 and some people do watch what they eat btw, sorry it hurts the tip.  The breadsticks weren't as good as we remembered, they were slightly overcooked (both batches that we tried) where the ends were like crackers and there was a crunchy layer over the whole thing.  The salad wasn't tossed well, there was a goop of dressing at the bottom and about half a cup of bottom-of-the-bag crouton crumbs at the top.    Ugh, so after such a lackluster service and poor show at the breadstick and salad that this chain is so famous for the entrees have to be great right?  Mine was ok, I had the sliced short rib and tortellini dish though the short ribs were dry and kind of nasty looking (frozen entree anyone?).  My friend got some steak fettucine dish with gorgonzola that was pretty pungent.  They had a balsamic glaze over the steak and the cheese was overpowering to the extent that I thought it was blue cheese dressing, not fettucine sauce on it.  We will most likely toss it.    The manager came by and we told him what we thought about that dish (I couldn't hide it).  He asked if we wanted to replace it with something else but my friend said it was fine.  However, the leftovers are still sitting in the fridge for his dish and its now Thursday.  Here's where there is a difference between our last experience and this experience.  Last time, the customer service would be so ideal that he would have just brought a dish that he thought we would have liked since it was obvious we weren't thrilled with the one we ordered.  This way we would most likely have been more impressed with the establishment and the dishes and service would have averaged out to a higher rating.    Anyway, I'm starting believe the naysayers and will probably stick with the local business.

This is the worst total wine I've been to.   Nobody asked if they can help me find something for a full 10 min when obviously I'm needing some guidance.   Then an elderly gentleman that works there finally turns into the area I'm in and I ask where the Everclear would be since he seems like he's in a hurry.  He takes me over to the vodka shelf (next aisle) and says "we may be out,  it's outlawed now,  another lady was looking for it today.   Yup!"   He gets up and starts walking away and all I can do is say um and raise my hand as if to say wtf that's it??  He says halfway turned to me walking away "did you have anything else ma'am?"  Well,  a good alternative would have been nice.   I think there was an alternate ingredient mentioned in the recipe that maybe a guy that works at a liquor store would know.  Or even a solid minute of a decent respectful conversation face to face.  But no,  I spent another five minutes walking around looking for it (or anyone that would even acknowledge me) and left empty handed.

The food was not very good at all.  The portions are very small, yet the prices are average if not slightly more.  It also seems like they will try to sell anything that can make money - edamame, boba teas, gyozas, whatever.  NOT a fan.

They get A for effort, C+ for execution.  They're a solid place with decent seafood.  But the prawn linguine was drowning in butter and tasted like nothing else.  The scallops and mahi mahi had a nice crust and was cooked well.  But the polenta/risotto cake was also heavily buttered.  I would stick with just seafood in the simplest possible way.  The prices are decent, not overpriced and the service is great.

I finally decided to check out Modern Steak on my birthday to see if its as good as some of the other Fox restaurants are.  We sat in the lounge so we can check out the happy hour, although I knew I wanted a steak for dinner.  My boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger and aioli fries and I ordered the 14 oz NY strip steak.  The waitress asked me if I wanted a salad or anything since the steak was a la carte.  $40 for just steak???  Anyway, the part I was slightly put off by is that she directed me to the $10 salads in the sides area of the dinner menu when there are $3 options on the happy hour menu.  I kind of felt like she was trying to cheat me..  :/  Then when she asked if I wanted to get the salad first or everything out at once, I said salad first and she convinced me to get everything at once saying they'll all fit on the table.  That wasn't what I was worried about - I was actually kind of hungry as I had just worked out.  After 30 minutes of sitting there, I started really crashing and my boyfriend intercepted her as she rushed by and asked her if any of our food was ready.  She said she'd check and brought out my salad saying sorry it got busy, the rest of our food should be out in 4 minutes.  The salad was actually pretty good.  I liked the dressing, the amount of dressing, the size of the bits of everything though it could have used a little more sweet morsels.  Other than that I enjoyed it quite a bit.    The rest of our food arrived as promised.  Here was my impression - the cheeseburger tasted just like Wendy's.  The $5 happy hour burger has a very thin patty of ground beef that is akin to the fast food chain with the exception that it is not square.  It was good..  but I can get that at Wendy's for half the price.  The fries were pretty good, was not a fan of the aioli (nothing special) and somehow the seasoning was bland.  Its funny because you can see thick chunks of salt(?) all over them..    The biggest disappointment was the $40 steak.  I requested it be cooked medium and what I got was a charred piece of meat that was absorbing moisture from my tongue as I chewed.  I kept waiting for someone to come by to ask if things were good because you can tell this was an overcooked steak.  There was not a drop of juice on the plate!  I was a fan of the caramelized in wine onions they served with the steak - helped me choke down the few bites that I did.  This was by far the most overcooked piece of meat I was served at a steak restaurant.  Even the one at Capital Grille (also overcooked, see my review) was not as bone dry like this one.  And the price paid for the soon to be doused in A1 just makes me want to cry.  I may go back for happy hour but I will stick to wine and the raw bar!

What's the big deal?  I feel like this place is over priced.  Their ideas are ok, but nothing spectacular.  Portions aren't very big.  I might come back and see if anything's improved once a year or so...  Or maybe come for happy hour where I can see what's going on at a lower rate..

Definitely not what its cracked up to be.  Not the worst if you have to be there for work or business, but microwaved egg scramble should not get 4 stars on Yelp.  Breakfast burrito had way too much of it in there too.  Coffee was decent.  If you don't have to be there, I would wait to get something good outside the building.

I love the artwork.  Its a tiny little restaurant crammed with a bunch of little tables and chairs.  You go up to order at the counter, there's a salsa bar in the corner with a LOT of different salsas (most are not that great).  They do bring you the food and you do get a basket of chips on the house.  The tacos are pretty heft - about 3 bucks each.  They are "Gourmet tacos" after all..    All in all, its kind of uncomfortable service/restaurant wise (self serve) but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas.  Not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good.  Get it to go if you don't mind packing a bunch of salsa cups.

I was rear ended and needed to have my bumper replaced as well as my exhaust pipe pulled back out. At first, they promise all kinds of things - they will take care of EVERYTHING including the rental car, getting the appropriate funds approved by insurance, etc. Come time though I had to call for the rental car, and I found their 'relationship' with Enterprise was $30/day which is the normal rate (actually more since they give discounts for rentals/week). That's where it began.  At one point after 2 weeks had passed, they told me the car was being detailed so I couldn't pick it up until Monday morning. Come Monday morning, they told me it wasn't quite done so they will drop it off at my place of work and pick the rental up from me at the same time. That night I received no call from anyone and the next morning I called them to find out what is going on with my car. After giving me the runaround saying they couldn't get in touch with the guy taking care of my car, the guy calls me back giving me a lame reason for not calling - they were working on the car until 8pm (I was still at work at midnight mind you) and were working on the car that morning. It doesn't take very long to give a customer a call to let them know what is going on and I had called them several times leaving messages for the guy taking care of my car. They told me they didn't like the way it was looking and that they hoped it would be ready by the next morning. The next morning I received a call saying they were hoping to be done by this morning and if not they will drop it off at my workplace like the arrangement from a couple nights ago. I got a call this afternoon asking if I had received a check from the insurance company, which I hadn't and told them so. At 5pm I called them asking what was going on and they said they were trying to clear it all up with the insurance company and that they will call me back in 10 minutes. At 8pm I was still sitting there waiting for a call that never come.    The next morning, the guy TEXTED me saying my car was ready and just to give them a few more hours to get the car detailed again.  They didn't have the guts to face me ever again, didn't even talk to me over the phone - we completed our business via TEXT.  They discouraged me from coming in, and had a car hiker come to my house for the exchange.    They had told me that they would pick up the last week of rental charges since it was their mistake having to fix the bumper, but I was billed for the full amount.  I didn't even bother with them - thank goodness Hertz picked up the tab.  This place is SLOW and VERY UNRESPONSIVE! You have to call them constantly to get a status report, even if they say they will do something don't hold your breath. I am very unhappy with the service I received from this place and will never go back to them again, which is unfortunate because they're so close to my house.

I needed to find a lawyer to evict a tenant.  I had used a lawyer before, but wanted to compare prices to ensure I wasn't getting taken advantage of.  I called this company for an estimate and the lady that picked up the phone was not very helpful at all.  She said there was a lawyer at their firm that can take care of such cases and he would want to meet and talk to me and the rate he charges is $325/hr.  I said just to talk about my case would cost $325/hr??  She says yes $325/hr.  I said well, how many hours do you think it would take for an eviction?  She starts getting an attitude and says it takes as long as it takes at $325/hr.  I said for the simplest eviction how many hours has it taken?  She just insists on $325/hr.    I've had less attitude from a hostess at the snottiest Scottsdale bar/restaurant.  Their rate is ridiculous, and the fact that you can't even get an estimate for such a set process is lame.  I guess to get any useful information to estimate your costs for going with this company would cost you about $110, assuming the lawyer can answer your questions more thoughtfully.  I'll stay with my laywer.

The toppings, set up, etc are creative, but definitely not the best tasting burgers I've ever had.  Their fresh donuts with salty caramel sauce was ok, but some were crunchy.  Sweet potato fries were decent but more on the limp side.  All in all, won't go kicking and screaming if it came to it but wouldn't suggest the place.

I'm not sure what happened.  He seemed very nice and willing on the phone, and actually did a treatment several months ago.  For some unknown reason he stopped returning my calls and my tenants calls.  After a full week and no response I had to hire another company.  Very odd?

We had the angus sliders, grilled cheese sandwich and buffalo chicken sandwich.  They all came with bacon on them - good quality and thick sliced but overcooked.  We drowned the sliders with ketchup to try to get some moisture and seasoning into them..  the buffalo chicken sandwich was ok, but sloppy and somehow bland as well.  The grilled cheese had 2 very mild cheeses in it so again pretty mild.  The sweet potato tots and the regular fries were both underdone and not crispy at all, and someone forgot to sprinkle some salt on these.  So somehow we ended up with a very bland meal that had a lot of salt (probably from the bacon).  Not a fan at all of the food!!  Maybe its just a place for drinking?

We sat at the bar since it was an early dinner. We ordered off the happy hour menu - pork sliders, queso and chips and ribs.  The sliders turned out to be the worst of the bunch.  The pulled pork was a bit dry and though the bun was nice, the whole thing was bland without some kind of sauce maybe.  The queso was probably one of the best I've ever had.  The ribs fell off the bone and the seasoning was pretty tasty despite the appearance of the dish.  The wine I had was very good, the margarita my friend had was super tangy but he enjoyed it.  All in all, I'd like to explore the menu further and maybe venture to the basement.  :)

Another Fox restaurant that is extremely overrated.  The burgers are decent, nothing too excellent or unique about them.  I think they're pretty greasy because I was nauseous after half a burger.  I tried the Zinburger and Diablo.    The truffle fries are ok but limp.  The aoli that comes with it isn't very well matched to it.  The sweet potato fries were ok but also a bit undercooked.  Not a fan, no need to go back.

I was so very disappointed!!!  This is not even close to the Al's Beef on Taylor street.  The beef tastes old and the fries are limp and soggy.  The decor is nice but no counter space to put your tray while you get ketchup.  Not that I will ever be coming back!

Drove up to use a Google Offer for a 7 course tasting menu they were offering - apparently just about everyone there that night were doing the same thing.  It looked a lot scarier than I was envisioning but the food put me at ease.  The husband seems to know his thing when it comes to wine pairings and food.  The wife was quite when we were there..  I guess she can be brusque according to some of these reviews.  I think just about all the courses were pretty impressive.  If you can get over the restaurant's appearance, you'd be in for a culinary treat.  I will say the risotto for one of the dishes were a bit undercooked, but overall impressive.  I definitely would like to return to try a regular offering and would jump at the chance for another tasting offered.

There are a few things I might've done differently but really I have nothing to complain about.  The decor/ambiance is nice.  Staff is helpful and nice, not too snooty.    The few things - I'd serve the bread and oil separately so its not all dripping with oil.  I'd chop the artichoke hearts a little on the pizza - the bite they land on is a bit overpowered.  The oil's a tiny bit heavy on the mushroom paperdelle.  I'd just take the top off the strawberries on the cheesecake - they're sliced but with caps on so you have to knock them off the cake and cut them off.  Why?  But the food's really solid and the pricing's appropriate.  I'd definitely come back.

This place is legit!  It's solid Mexican fare at reasonable prices and made quickly.  Tuesdays are taco tuesdays apparently so the carnita, pollo asada and pastor tacos are only a dollar a piece.  They were all solid, but my favorite was probably the steak - not a special but reasonably priced and probably the best I've ever had.  We also had the red chile burrito which was very meaty.  It was very good, but a bit too much after a while.    I definitely want to try the bombito one day and the street tacos were awesome.  Parking is kind of hard in that complex, they seem a bit territorial with the spaces along the stores..  The bathrooms were much nicer than I thought they would be so don't avoid going in there like I was doing at first!  :P

Had their lettuce wraps - only complaint was they only give u 2 leafs of lettuces.  wth?  Had to ask for some more and got 2 more.. which actually was enough for the rest...  The sushi was good!  Not all sloppy, not a huge chunky slice, not too much rice - a lot more things can go wrong with sushi than people know.  Calamari was good, nice flavor in the batter, strips not rings.    I think I found my new sushi happy hour place!  Its great when you're between chinese food and sushi - you can get both at a reasonable price here!

Tried the arugula flatbread and the margherita (?) flatbread.  Both were delicious, very thin and crusty base.  The salad was spinach, raspberries, bleu cheese and pine nuts which was also very good.  The fillet was very tender but the sauce smelled very similar to chinese herbal medicine that I didn't like.  The taste however was pretty decent.  The asparagus that came with the fillet was not cleaned very well at all and had lots of grit.  Also had several spears that were overdone and stringy.    All in all, I am intrigued by this place and would like to return for more samples of the menu.  However, slightly thrown off by the gritty asparagus..

I got the beef bourgignon shepherd's pie and I was not a fan.  Isn't bourgignon AND shepherd's pie supposed to be more like a stew at the bottom?  It seems like mine was over reduced, I ended up with mash with chunks of meat and a few carrots that tasted like burnt sauce.  The potato topping had 2 whole cubes of potato in it, which I'm thinking weren't supposed to be there.    We also got the mac and cheese with and without pancetta - it was kind of bland.  Not very cheesy, not very much of anything really..    The fork tender spare ribs were tasty but I've had better.  The pork chile stew was actually pretty good but the taste was a bit strong.  It had the same taste as chipotle steak - maybe its cumin?  The corn bread that accompanied was unlike any I've ever had..  it was airy, not dense, but kind of dry at the same time with a crunchy crust - maybe too much butter?  I love corn bread and I did not like what they did to it..  The desert was interesting - we got the bacon smores.  The bacon was way too salty, or maybe it needed a couple more dips in the chocolate to offset it better but the saltiness overpowered anything else.  The quality of the bacon seemed good, maybe they can get a reduced sodium version?  The death by chocolate was good, but it was very chocolatey - I do not recommend it if you don't like fudge dipped in chocolate on chocolate ice cream.  The one thing about the plating..  the lil smear of thick chocolate sauce (mousse?) does not add to the attractiveness whatsoever..  The service was great and I love the decor.  That being said, the portions are small for the pricing and the food is not very good.  Don't try to be fancy if you can't do it well.

They do kind of hassle you a bit if you have a Groupon or some kind of deal so I'd say just go and do the happy hour.  Its not that bad of a deal.  The chips and salsa you get is pretty fantastic.  The chips are thicker than typical - almost like pita chips.  Salsa is a pureed chipotle type, not a pico de gallo type.  The taste is pretty good and the chips aren't terribly greasy.    We got the barbacao taco plate, the queso dip and the sweet potato fries.  The barbacao tacos weren't great..  We're huge fans of this dish at fuego bistro but they taste a lot better as a short rib with cornbread than as a taco.  The rice and beans that come on the platter are very good.  I would try a different taco.    The queso dip was unusually bland.  The consistency was very rich and thick but somehow it doesn't taste very good.  We ended up mixing in the salsa and it improved the taste quite a bit.  You also seem to get way less chips than you would think you'd need for about a cup and a half of queso..  The sweet potato fries were awesome!  The batter is pretty light and with the right amount of salt.  Some of the fries were limp and some were crunchy, but all in all a very good menu item and a steal at $3.  The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with is pretty fabulous as well.    All in all, the location kind of sucks.  Its always more hassle than I like when you have to valet or validate - no matter how painless it is.  Especially now with the theater being a dinner serving type, its hard to find yourself there just to eat.  But if you're there, this place is pretty good!

Ok, maybe their chef changed or something because the pad thai was a lot better this time around (although I did ask for medium and my friend could barely eat it.  I'd say it was more of a 7/10 than 5/10).  The crab wontons are kind of expensive, but they have more crab in it than any other place around here.  The papaya salad was decent but not mind blowing.  I think I would prefer cilantro and peanuts in my pad thai but this place is pretty good.  They did overcook the noodles a tiny bit.

Its so good!  We got the supreme equivalent and the veggies lost a lot of water and made the center very soggy.  Despite this, we enjoyed the pizza very much - the crust is crisp and chewy, there's just the right amount of sauce that doesn't taste weird, and there is plenty of cheese and topping.  This would definitely be our go to pizza place if it was near our house.  Next time we'll probably go with just dryer veggies like mushroom or olive.  Other than that, its non-fou-fou, non organic, straight up old school pizza for movie night.

The service at this place was AweSOME and we loved our waiter.  The chips and salsa was very good, a mix of tortilla and plantain chips.  I usually don't like the verde they serve at restaurants but both of the salsas were tasty with a slight kick of spicy.  Never ending!  We got refills..  ~.~  The steak tacos were phenomenal.  I'd prefer these over boring steaks any day - they're tacos but deliver great steak flavor.  They had tiny slivers of I think radish or beets that were a great compliment.  The pork carnita enchiladas were great too.  Not sure about the agua frescas - the watermelon one tastes like watermelon juice (its really good), the lemon one was very tart.  I liked the watermelon one but you can tell both has a ton of sugar in them.  I chose to drink Coke because it was the healthier option!    Not sure about the dessert options.  We got the bread pudding and it was full of nuts and raisins, carmelized pineapples and a scoop of gelato.  I wasn't a fan...  Maybe next time I'll try one of the other 2 choices..  All in all, the prices are high for the portions although the endless chips and salsa and willingness to refill these by staff helps.  (They refill both salsas and chips every time which I thought was excellent).  Taberna Mexicana is definitely my top Mexican restaurant - but will wait to get Groupons, or other deals to dine there again.

This is exactly the type of neighborhood carryout type pizza I was looking for.  You order at the counter and get a number on a stick so they can find you when they deliver your food.  We had to catch a movie so we asked for our pizza in a box.  Their time estimation was on point and they didn't forget about the box.  We tried the Barro's special(?) which is basically like a supreme.  The crust was chewy yet crisp and the veggies didn't make the top part too watery.  I think it was pretty well executed overall.  I really was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to try some other items on the menu.  Their beer selection is decent and the prices are pretty good.  Lots of TVs there too, though I'm not sure they have the NFL package or anything.  It would be a great place to catch a game or go before/after a movie for sure.

Pretty awesome!  The prices are kind of steep, but the food is the best I've had at a dining theater.  Try the mahi sliders and calamari (although the cocktail sauce isn't as good as the aoli)!  The sweet potato fries weren't as good - pretty limp/soggy.  The angus sliders were ok.  The coke was awesome (a LOT of places don't have the settings right believe it or not!).    They keep the theater positively frigid so the blanket really comes in handy.  It is a bit dark in there so the blanket also doubles as a bib sometimes!  :P  The screen and sound quality is also tops.  Definitely a treat, but so far the best one I've been to!

Snotsdale vibe aside, the place is pretty nicely decorated and the atmosphere is nice.  We came for restaurant week and our waitress was great.  She was not the least bit snotty!  For first course we tried the calamari and the crispy brussel sprouts.  The sprouts were basically deep fried with some kind of white sauce drizzled over it.  With the sweet-tangy salsa it was actually very good and the portion was huge.  The calamari was cooked perfectly but I didn't understand the combination.  It came with roasted tomato, capers and artichoke hearts.  Not bad, not as big of a portion size.  For the entrees we chose the short rib and pork chop.  The short rib was a large square rectangle which threw me off slightly, but the taste was pretty good.  Came with a very sweet balsamic reduction, blue cheese gnocci and wilted spinach.  The pork chop was cooked perfectly with a nice crust and soft middle.  The sauce was good, although it could have used more and bed of vegetables that included fingerling potatoes were great but also not as plentiful.  Just a little bit of green on the plate and it would've been just perfect.  All in all, I'm surprised the yelp rating on this restaurant is so low.  Must be mostly pricing or service because the food is pretty good.  A don't miss for Restaurant Week!

I had the oxtail ravioli.  The sauce was good and the pasta was cooked well.  Didn't really have a lot of flavor, the dish could have used something else..  Also tried my friends' meatball thing?  It was green..  a plate of little meatballs..  Not a fan.  Tasty, but not worth the prices.

Had the savory crepes - Chicken Caesar and Ham and Cheese.  They were delicious, even reheated (had left overs).  Friendly owner, cute shop.  Reasonable prices.  A must try when you're in the neighborhood!

Love the atmosphere and decor.  I think this place would be pretty good for big groups.  The bar is nice and I love the drink menu.  I'd like to try each one, they sound so interesting.  I had the Persian this time around.    The chicken and waffles had good flavor.  Loved the seasoning on the chicken and it was cooked just about right.  There was one piece that had a bit of wet batter but for the most part it was well worth the 10.  4 large pieces of chicken on top of a smallish square of waffle.  It was actually way better than Lo-Los and probably about the same price!  I tried some of the filet mignon, duck and scallop entrees.  Loved the combinations, especially the filet and the scallop - wasn't sure about the risotto that came with the duck.  The glazes for the filet and scallop was very good as well.  All in all, the prices are kind've high but reasonable for the product and experience they bring.  I would love to come back to try the rest of the menu!

We got the pastor burrito and 3 tacos - pastor, asada and carnita.    The food definitely tastes more authentic.  They also give you sliced radish, cucumber, lemons, and pickled carrots to accompany your meal.  The sauces they have are delicious as well - I liked the darker one in the squeeze bottle but needed the stuff they gave us in a bowl for heat.    I'm not positive that it was asada, but one of the tacos was particularly amazing.  Definitely the best carne asada I've ever had (if that's what it is).  The flavor is complex without being salty.  Its awesome.  Definitely a must try!

The decor is ultra modern yet cozy.  Very nice atmosphere.  Service was outstanding and staff was very friendly and helpful.  The salmon was crispy with a sweet tangy sauce on top of a bed of spinach, onions and lima beans.  The sauce was a little much after a while but if you wipe most of it off and "wash" it a bit in the juices, its pretty perfect.  I'm a fan.  My friend had the chicken which was more sultry than sweet.  The flavoring was very good on that as well.  For dessert we had the Coffee and Donuts - crispy mini churros with some homemade coffee ice cream (VERY good), there was also a miniature mug with cocoa/coffee(?) in it.    All in all, the dishes are very creative and well thought out.  Not quite 5 stars, but tasty nonetheless.  We would definitely go back.

This is the first place I'd go whenever I got my allowance if I was a kid living near by!    The shop is adorable!  The space is very tight but its crammed full of old toys and candies that I'd never seen in years.  They have cookies, brownies, some bars and of course the ice cream.  The pricing doesn't seem outrageous either - a 2 scoop order is just 3.25 or so.  You have the option to upgrade to waffle cone and add toppings which increases the cost a bit.  They also offer coffee and some drinks.  Love the pricing, love the goods, and love the toys!

They have plenty of TVs which is nice.  The volume was a little too high and the tables are just a smidge too close together.  Its the little things right?  Also adding to the weird atmosphere is the children sporadically placed in an otherwise sporty bar.  The food is about average to poor.  The wings are decent but could use a little more zip in the sauce.  Definitely not original or exceptional.  The burgers are odd because the meat is actually pretty good but its put in this cheap mcdonald's like bun and all you get is a couple slices of red onion.  First of all, why would you want 2 slices of red onion and what about the usual lettuce and tomato?  Pickle anyone?  The fries are like In and outs of Phoenix area - dry, dark, and shrivelled.  The onion rings are like plump versions of French's onions, the things you put on top of green bean casseroles.    It seems like a fun place, and I'd love to find something that's great there, but the food is definitely not a draw for me at this point.  At any location.

Hate their two drink minimum policy which food items do not count for and their no picture policy.  Didn't use a flash, and everyone else was taking pictures and I'm the only one they give a hard time to.  Wth!  They cram people in like sardines, and do the automatic gratuity thing.  Annoyed with the whole experience!  Especially the picture thing, you'd think forty bucks a ticket gives you the right to document the event.

I really don't understand the rating for this place.  I think the owner somehow gets bad reviews pulled and pays off local kids to write good ones.    My boyfriend and I LOVE pizza.  We eat it for breakfast, lunch, and still can go for some for dinner.  This is the first and only time we've actually thrown out over half a left over pizza because its edible when its fresh and just gets worse from there.  I'm sorry to say this because I always root for the underdog, but this is not a winner.

It's pretty much Mexican fare.  Everything we tried here was delicious!  We had nachos which was a pretty nice portion.  I ordered a chicken burrito that came grilled.  The prices were a tiny bit high but if they can consistently serve up good food I'd definitely be back.  They didn't even have a band there at the time I went!  Going back for a concert next!

They're a swanky little spot in Old Town.  I can see that, because there's so many people.  I just don't understand why..  The set up is pretty cool.  Kinda cozy, kinda industrial.  A little darker than I like, especially where the pastries are since you can barely see them..  Which is why I asked the guy what they were and turned out they were actually 3 items spread out over 6 display risers.  A little sign or something to hint at what these items were would definitely help the ordering process.  Especially if the worker missed the delivery and had no idea what was in them..    So we order 2 black coffees and turns out they didn't have enough to fill the tiny tiny cups for both so they say it'll take a few minutes while they brew it I guess manually?  They have the Aeropress (which is what we use at home), and various sized drip contraptions which I'm assuming they went with to make our coffee.    The coffee was a bit sour, which happens when the coffee is under brewed.  We do it ourselves at home once in a while, but we're not paying 2.50 per Dixie cup.  The scone was actually pretty decent but I was looking for a pastry, not the limited option of scone, muffin or cookie.  Even so, I wouldn't rate so low if the coffee was good at the coffee shop.

The food is pretty good.  They give out bread and herb infused olive oil that is delicious.  Seems like they add extra salt to the oil to bring out the flavors more because its not as bland as it usually is.  The proportions are weird because you probably get about a quarter cup of oil and a hunk of bread that's as big as a large man's fist.  I dunno, felt a little bad wasting all that oil..  The clam and fennel sausage appetizer was very good.  The sausage adds a brawny taste to the clams and broth.  Again, I wished we had some extra bread to sop up some of the broth with.  Approx. 2 cups wasted there..  I got the carne pizza - its good and I enjoyed it, but not sure if its the sweet sauce but when you first bite into it, it tastes like a familiar cheap pizza (think Lil Caesars, Peter Piper, I couldn't really put my finger on it), but the flavor becomes fuller and more "quality" later on.  Its a bit hard to explain..  The meats on the pizza was fantastic and I do believe the cheese is good.  The crust is fluffy and chewy, however, can use a bit more flavor.  We also got the farfelle that was a special - had artichoke hearts, olives, sausage, and mushroom in a dark brown sauce.  The pasta was al dente, and home made.  Overall it was good, however it is an odd mix of strong and sometimes overpowering flavors.  I do believe I can get into it though.  All in all, this is probably my favorite Italian place in Old Town.  The prices are a bit hefty, but I'm pleased with the portion sizes.  We will definitely go back, but mostly reserve for special occasions.

I wish I lived a little closer!  We were in the area for a Craigslist deal and decided to get some food.  We ordered the Philly steak sandwich to share and some fries.  The sandwich was gigantic so its good that we did!  Its more like a french dip sandwich but the meat is good and flavorful.  Had some peppers and onions that weren't overcooked and added some crunch.  The bread was flaky and soft.  Fries were also cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt.  Its really a neat spot with a live feed of Time Square and old Jerry Seinfeld episodes.  They also serve beer and have all kinds of beverages and desserts.  Would definitely come more often if it was in my hood!

Kind of a cluster..  I stood next to the girl for over 15 min and she still ended up giving my pizza to some other asian girl.  Seriously??  So she chases her down and I get my pizza with some random girl's thumbprint on one section of my pizza.  Great.  That aside, I can see why this truck gets such high marks.  The crust is crisp yet chewy.  It actually kind of reminds me of Totino's pizza rolls because of the crust, sausage and general flavor of the whole thing.  Even the reddish grease.  I love pizza rolls..  I would like to see nutritional info.  If its not as terrible for you as TPR I will probably stalk this truck all over town.

The saving grace for this theater is the Groupon they readily have available.  $5 for a move AND a soda makes up for the high prices on food.  The most appropriately priced items are the soda ($3) and popcorn ($4.50) believe it or not.  We also had the steak quesadilla - solid, on the edge of too much cheese.  I will definitely be back, but probably not at full price!

Ok, so I've been back a few times - couple for brunch and once for happy hour since my last review.    Overall, the foods mediocre and I noticed they serve the beer colder now.  I do appreciate the beer selection (the white chocolate one is my favorite, sweet but not too sweet like so many others!).  The shrimp tacos are passable, salmon flatbread brunch thing was ok.  Same with German sausage plate.    My favorite and the one dish I feel like beats other restaurants is the french toast.  This is the only thing I've found that would make me go - I would like to go to OHSO!

What the heck have I been eating??!  This is hands down the best Chinese buffet in the Phoenix area, hands down!  First off this is by far the best sushi spread I've ever seen - including the buffets in Vegas!  Pretty much what you'd get at Stingray is included in the buffet - and we went to the lunch buffet so its not even just for dinner.  They had numerous rolls and unlike other places they don't try to cram a bunch of rice into them.  They also had 4 different nigiri selections and some tempura in this area.  Just this part of the buffet alone is worth the money!  The chinese food is actually legit too!  They weren't very oily or too salty and they aren't stingy with mystery meat - the quality of the meat is much better than other buffets.  They're also very good about refilling the selections.    The dessert was probably the most disappointing.  We didn't try the ice cream - though I really like the fact that its not a community system and there's someone actually serving you the scoops (WAY less gross!).  We had some fruit - strawberries were great and gigantic.  The German chocolate cake was weird and dried out.  Not only was it crusty, the flavor was kind of weird and it was very dense..  The cream puffs were also disappointing because the filling was whipped cream and not very much of it.    Speaking of stuffings - they had real crab rangoons with lots of cream cheese and some green onions and crab parts mixed into it to make the filling!  I thought nobody did it right anymore!  Despite the very few disappointments - this is still by far the best buffet in the Phoenix area.  This buffet makes Stingray pretty obsolete - for about the same price we can stuff ourselves with the same food and more!

The decor is great.  Very nice set up, its fun having a huge window where the kitchen is viewable from the mall side.  That said, the rest of it was not the best..  They give you a crostini appetizer/sample(?) with some kind of cheese on top.  It was super salty and not great... unsure what the point was..  They have Coke Light, I guess a naturally sweetened version of Diet Coke.  My friend ordered it and I was hemming and hawing and decided on the water.  He brought us 2 cokes anyway and charged for both.  I think part of the problem is there's no music, but the noise level is a bit high sometimes.  We had a hard time hearing half the things the waiter was saying and I'm sure it goes the other way as well.  So we tried the Cavatelli and the Gnocchi.  The cavatelli was not the best pasta, sausage pasta plate I've ever had.  The gnocchi got a bit old after a few bites.  Basically a bed of creamed corn, potato gnocchi and chunks of panchetta.  Not terrible, but gets old.  All in all, wouldn't go back.  The prices don't justify the lackluster pasta dishes.  They bring you 4 pieces of bread at a time (we had a table of 4 so we asked for like 2 refills).  The cheese plate is not very big, but tasty.  However, I thought they would bring us more bread for the cheese plate.. didn't happen, had to ask for it separately.  My friend's water glass didn't get filled all night, we tried moving it to the edge of the table too.  We had 4 different waiters and nobody can fill a water glass for over half the dinner?

I was really scared..  But turns out they're a very decent Chinese place!  The rice is a bit overcooked, but the actual food is good.  And gotta love their prices.  This is now my go to for Chinese!

I finally decided to replace my peninsula with matching granite in my kitchen.  A guy came out and made some measurements 2 weeks ago and was throwing around fancy terminology for granite.  I'm not going to know the scientific name of Venetian Gold.  I ended up figuring out what it was and updating the guy later.  He tells me he found a leftover piece that should match, fit and would be cheaper since its a remnant.  I go to AZ Tile and it looks a bit pale.  Sure enough when I went with a piece of my granite (luckily we were going to do the backsplash and so was able to take off the 4inch border) it wasn't even close.  Disaster averted.  The reason for my rating is this:  it took 2 trips to pick out a slab at the AZ tile, which nobody met me for either.  They were very helpful and patient at AZ tile and granite which helped the process.  The initial trip by the salesman was a complete waste.  He measured, and thought he knew what kind of granite it was which was later corrected by myself.  Another person came 2 weeks later and did a final measurement for the countertop anyway.  So ultimately this first appointment was to just meet the guy that would leave my emails and messages unanswered for about a week before responding.  In the process I received 3 different bids which I wasn't very confident was correctly done in the end but just wanted it done.  And finally, since I knew exactly what I wanted and it was only a matter of finding a slab that matched my existing counter which I did myself in about ten days, why did it take almost a full month from the first appointment to the last??  I thought the process was very drawn out which I would have been more patient for if someone was more responsive to my emails and told me exactly what to expect and when.

This place is a bit cozy, but once you've settled in it's not very noticeable.  The set up is very shabby chic, but its clean and appealing.  The owner runs the service very well.  He was on top of all his customers' needs the whole way through, directing the kitchen and the supporting waitress and chipping in himself to make sure everything was well.  The complimentary bread looked disastrous - it was cold and looked like it was undercooked.  One bite though and it was the best Italian bread we'd ever had.  The flavor was so good.  The caesar salad was also excellent.  We had the mushroom and sausage pizza, which unfortunately was burnt.  It was a bit bitter, or else we probably would've eaten the whole pizza.  The red pepper flakes were super flavorful which I appreciated a lot - most places' flakes are stale and doesn't provide this much kick.    So usually the burnt pizza at a pizza place would definitely lose a star or two, but I can't help but love this place.  The owner was so nice, and even gave us some homemade amaretto that was off the charts.  It was great on our dessert of chocolate covered ball of chocolate, pistachio and strawberry gelatos.  The hospitality of the place, the quality of the food and service, and the set up of the place are why I'm a super fan of this restaurant.  I'm hoping the pizza will be good next time too!

FINALLY!  I hope they add some more venues!  I caught them at a lil bar in Old Town.  Hardly any wait!  I got the traditional (cold) lobster roll and some lobster mac and cheese.  The bread is awesome - kinda sweet and buttered and toasted just right.  The sandwich was stuffed with lobster, not too much mayo.  It is kind of small for $18, but I'm glad it wasn't a disappointment after years of hype!  The mac and cheese was a little disappointing..  The pasta is way overcooked so its really mushy.  The cheese sauce isn't bad and I enjoyed the lobster flavor well incorporated into the dish.  Others felt it was a bit "fishy".    We also tried a homemade whoopie pie which I didn't really like at all..  It kinda tastes like warm cookies that resemble ice cream sandwich ones with marshmallow fluff in the middle instead of ice cream.    All in all, I'll probably stick to the lobster rolls!  Maybe have the clams.  :)

Jalapeno beans were too watery.  Ribs were very salty on the hard outter layer of meat.  Chicken was ok..  I liked their sweet bbq sauce.  Maybe I'll try the pulled pork next time.  The prices were kind of high for what they offer.  The free ice cream had a weird greasy texture.

I gotta say, I was not expecting such great service!  The place was packed so we decided to sit at the bar.  Luckily the hostess followed us because we couldn't find 2 seats together like a fellow customer had thought she'd seen.  She put us in between a couple groups at the long table, one was about to leave anyway.  Service was prompt, food was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and served hot.  Is that too much to ask for?  In Scottsdale, so often it is.  It was refreshing.  The burgers are solid.  I had the chili burger with sweet potato tots.  Love the tots.  They were cooked perfectly.  Burgers were done to order.  I really liked their creative sauces - chipotle(?) aioli, pineapple aioli, spicy ketchup.  We also had the calamari which was great.  The prices are pretty solid too, but the portions make up for it I think.    We also did the Reese's pot brownie with ice cream.  Get a dollar off if you check in on Yelp btw!  Paid for the ice cream addition.  :)  Its a brownie on top of Reese's I think in a bed of marshmallow fluff topped with ice cream if you add it.  Very sweet, probably nice to share with like 2-3 other people to get a good portion without feeling sick.  All in all, its a worthy establishment that justify the pricing with great service and solid food.  Happy hour deals are mostly just drinks at this point.  A buck off appetizers too, but not great for food as far as happy hour goes.  Updating my review to add the backyard bbq burger - its awesome!  Burger with bbq sauce and a fried onion on top.  YUM!

The food is actually pretty good.  We had the chicken caesar salad which could probably use a little something (olives?) but the chicken pieces were tender and seasoned.  We also got a thin crust pepperoni pizza which was also very good.  The slices are huge though and it was a little challenging to eat.  I wonder if they can make the pizzas like 2 inches smaller and charge a little less..  Ah well, I can't wait to try the deep dish!  So far I haven't found a decent one out here in Phoenix!

I honestly don't understand what the rave is about.  The evening started out well enough - we didn't realize we'd need a reservation but was able to sit at one of the high tops near the bar.  The table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.  We started out with the cheddar bites.  They were mini, dense and rather not great.  Its almost like a failure attempt at recreating Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits.  The shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from NOLA.  The meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  The duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  Too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.  The reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  These were the kinds of dishes that you might see on Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen.  But they wouldn't be winners by any means.    The place is kept COLD.  We were near the vents, but still, by the time our food reached our table, they were lukewarm at best.  All in all, the service was inconsistent and the food is mediocre at best.  At such high prices, I'm not sure this will get them a revisit from me.

Kinda seems out of place at this particular strip mall but I hope it works out for them.  We tried the spicy chicken wontons which came with 2 delicious sauces.  The wings were pretty good as well, but I really wish they'd take a field trip to Golden Sea in Chicago to check out theirs.  Its almost the same, but not quite.  And they don't cut off the stem which helps eating them be not so clumsy.  The udon was not traditional, but pretty good.  The house dynamite was also quite delicious.  I'd say just about everything was enjoyable in varying degrees and I will definitely be back for more.

We walked up to the patio not sure what we were supposed to do, but they had a guy watching out for such visitors and he came over to show us how the restaurant is set up.  So you order at the counter, take a number and they bring the food out to you - kind of like Panera or Paradise Bakery.  We tried the orchard french toast and biscuits and gravy.  Both were solid solid dishes!  At about $10 each, I think the french toast could have used another slice though.  The lemon bar was also very good, though my friend thought it was a bit too tart.  I enjoyed it though, seems like they included pulp which I liked.  The coffee was also delicious - hot not iced.  Yes, I am a fan, though it lost 1 star for portion size.

I had a rental with a really bad roof rat problem.  The technician inspected the property and texted me pictures of his findings for where he though the rats were getting in.  He plugged all the holes and even cleared the weeds at the side of the house for a very reasonable price.

I can't believe how different my dish was.  I usually go to the Daily Dose in Old Town and 9 times out of 10 get the prime stack sandwich.  The bun was the same, but not much else.  The meat was skimpy and unevenly spread on the sandwich and they were cheap with the slaw.  It also seemed like they heated the meat up on the grill because it was super dry and there were parts of it that tasted burnt.  It was utterly disappointing and if that was the first time I'd gotten that entree item I probably would never know how great it could be.  Service was also pretty bad for not being very busy.  I don't think they refilled any of our drinks and I had a watery remnants of coke for half the meal.  The Old Town branch is better with the service as well.

I wish I had better things to say.  I called in my order and they said 15 min.  40 min later I was still waiting for my food.  I ordered jerk chicken taco, ultimate nachos and rib tips with mac and cheese and potato salad.  They forgot to give me the sides - mac and cheese and potato salad.    Jerk chicken tacos and the nachos pretty much had the same grilled chicken with some kinda thai chili sauce on top.  The tortillas weren't very good..  and the chips were chewy..  Its just odd to have sweet and sour sauce on top of the nachos..  They both were like something scraped together from whatever you'd find in the fridge.  The rib tips were ok.  Not especially good, not especially bad.    All in all, I had such high hopes for the place and they were super nice.  But the food isn't very good and it sucks that they didn't give me part of my order.  Shoulda known when the door was locked and you had to enter through the store next door.

This place definitely does not do food like kittens do cute..    So we got the Luis(?) basically a shaved meat sandwich with mac and cheese subbed for fries and the trio of chips and dip.  The chips were salted VERY inconsistently - some chips didn't have any salt and some would burn your tongue it's so salty.  They are also very stingy with the sauces - they only fill the cups about halfway with the salsa, guac and queso.  The flavor of the salsa and queso weren't bad but the guacamole was basically a hacked up avocado with a few tomato pieces in it.  Bland.    The sandwich wasn't the worst, but was hard to eat.  The veggies are arranged on top like its supposed to be open faced and the shape of the roll also makes it kind of ambiguous.  I tried both ways, eating open faced style and tucking the veggies inside and biting sideways but either way its kind of messy.  Anyway, the meat is barely seasoned at all.  An au jus or some kind of aoli sauce or really ANYTHING would have helped it a lot.  The mac and cheese wasn't bad.  The sauce got a bit chunky when it started cooling off but otherwise the flavor isn't bad and they didn't overcook the pasta.  So the food was not awful but not very good and at about ten bucks a pop, I'd rather go to about a million other places so I think I probably won't be back.  I'm seriously getting flashbacks from a couple of those chips.. (not the good kind either)

We had given up almost all hope before finally going to this store regarding an iphone that wasn't pretty but was working fine just the day before it just cut out.  Within a few minutes the nice man behind the counter wrote up a receipt for $45 and had a preliminary diagnosis of a battery issue that should be resolved with replacement.  As promised, an hour later the phone was ready and as good as it was before it stopped working.    I'd recommend this place for anybody!  They actually try to fix your phone and the costs are reasonable.

I sold a laptop almost 10 years ago to someone who lived in Canada.  The laptop got held up at customs so they reported me to Ebay and Paypal like they never received the product and never cleared my name.  I sent all my documentation from the post office saying that I sent the package and they did something wrong with my documentation I hear, because recently I decided to try to clear this off my account (I haven't used Ebay or Paypal in about 8 years because of this).  So I call customer service and it sounds like a quick fix.  I'm thinking why didn't I just do this sooner?  And 40 min in I'd talked to 3 different people and explain what had occurred 5 different times.  They all tell me they'll get this fixed right away.  Somehow I get transferred way back out to the front (first step call receivers).  About an hour after I'd decided to try to do this I pretty much give up.  Last I heard, the guy told me I should be getting an email and they'll clear this right up.    My account is still restricted and I never received a call or email about anything.  I used to be a super seller(I don't even remember what its called), and bought a lot of things on Ebay.  But I guess now I'm not worth much to them and vice versa.

Such an awesome concept!!  The shaved ice is so soft and fluffy and it comes in many different flavors which you can use to make custom snohs or the combo flavors they have on the board.  They have just about any topping you can think of and you can tell the ingredients are of good quality.  The decor is so cute too.   They also have milk teas you can make all kinds of combos with too and thai iced teas.    LOVE this place!  I will be visiting much more frequently!  Pat bing su is my favorite dessert so this is right up my alley!

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Its just about as good as Chicago!!  I'm so glad!  Even the workflow is the same, they take orders before you get to the register and your food is ready in no time.  Its awesome!  PLUS because we're not in Chicago they even have a nice patio area so you can enjoy your food outside!  Pricing's the same too!  SO HAPPY!

I was in a pretty bad accident involving an underinsured driver totaling my new car and 2 pretty hard impacts effecting my back/neck and feet.  I was very shaken up and unsure about what needed to be done in the coming months.  I wasn't trying to get money out of this, but I wanted to at least try to make sure I didn't lose financially from this accident that was in no way my fault.    I thought the law office was very professional with a caring touch throughout the whole process from start to finish.  There was never a moment where I felt like they weren't talking to each other and the "right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing" like it often happens at other law offices, doctor offices, you name it.  There were weekly updates to see how I was doing with my physical therapies and how this was effecting my life.  When things came up they advised me on what to do and really helped me figure out the full impact of this incident.    Anyway, I wasn't even sure about hiring a lawyer but I am definitely glad I did.  I followed their advice and received all the care and consulting I needed to be able to move forward without any question of maybe I should have done this or that.  I think they did a great job overall in a sensitive situation and although I hope to never need to call them again, I definitely will if such a thing happens again!

I'm not a huge fan of breakfast food.  But I got breakfast here just for you~~  :P  So I can see why a lot of reviewers said to go for the home fries.  The hash browns looked fine, perfectly golden on the top, exactly the way I prefer it.  However, I'm pretty sure there weren't the additional flavorings like the rosemary and onions in that~!  The home fries had great flavor AND they cooked crispy on at least one of the sides of each piece.  Absolutely one of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  I got the special of the day which was 3 eggs scrambled with ham off the bone, anaheim chili peppers, and cheese with a side of tortilla.  It was delicious.  Good char on the tortilla too.  It was very slightly underdone, but I actually prefer that over the risk of overdone eggs.  I guess the one thing that detracted from the place was the limited menu.  They don't really serve any alcoholic beverages (which is actually a bit refreshing), and some common breakfast items are not on the menu (ie biscuits and gravy, french toast).  But hey, if I can pick anything off their menu and it will be equally delicious, I would always come back!

They have a handful of noodle and rice dishes, curry dishes and some asian appetizers like gyoza and spring rolls.  The food is all pretty pricey at around 10 and the portions are smaller with way too little meat.  We tried mongolian beef and broccoli which was VERY bland.  I'm not sure if the broccoli was frozen, but there was water at the bottom.  The meat was overcooked so very tough.  We had to use the Siracha to make it edible.  The kung pao chicken I got with rice instead of noodles.  It was mostly cabbage and peanuts..  No heat pretty much whatsoever.  I think a school cafeteria probably could have done better.  I tried to get bahn mi but the 3 options were lemongrass chicken, chicken teriyaki and steak.  (What, no pork?).  Weird place, way overpriced, almost like Pei Wei - I'm not sure which one's worse.

The deep fried barbeque ribs were decent.  Tasted pretty good, nice caramelized sauce.  It comes with a yogurt sauce that complements it nicely.  They don't boil the meat which I'll give them props for.  The fries were awesomely crispy.  However, they were SALTY.  The 3 sauces the fries come with were very good, but I couldn't even see the salt on the potatoes to be able to brush it off.    The mussels were delicious!  The bread it comes with was actually too salty too, but I was able to brush off a lot of it, and dip it in the sauce to wash it out a bit.  The curry based sauce was very good this way.  This is the only dish I may possibly ever go back for.  Very good.  The burger they had trouble getting going.  I ordered it medium, got it pretty much looking like raw ground beef in the middle.  They took it back and seems like cooked it just on the side I had cut it, the cut edge was brown but still raw beef in the middle.  They took it again and we thought they said they'd redo the whole thing.  We got it back with the bites missing, burned to a crisp on one side and still raw in the very middle on half the patty.  We all gave up and they took it off the bill and gave us dessert on the house.  The little bite I had was decent, seems like they seasoned it with soy sauce or something.  At least that's what I tasted before the burnt flavor overpowered everything.  However, its pretty tiny for a 12 dollar burger, which is pretty hefty already for a happy hour special.    The strawberry shortcake was pretty delicious.  I would prefer a little more shortcake but it was good.  Overall not too sweet, edible creme (I usually don't like whipped cream or anything like that).  Donut holes weren't bad, came with a nice sauce though it would be better as a thicker sauce.  Chocolate pudding cake was delicious, though it's hard to mess up.  Its like slightly raw brownie batter or chocolate lava cake.  Yum.  The sweet potato cheesecake I was less of a fan of.  It starts tasting like sweet potato and ends tasting something like Cheez Wiz.   All in all, despite the kitchen mess up I wasn't too upset over it because they really seemed like they were trying to make it right.  Our waitress was awesome, and the bar staff was great too while we were there.  The drink specials are AWESOME, the food specials not so much (as far as pricing goes).  The food isn't very impressive at all with the exception of the mussels.  Maybe I'll go back far mussels and wine, but I really don't see anything else worthwhile.

So we walk up to the place around 545pm, there's a sign out that says happy hour 4-7pm amongst other hour information, and the girl looks up at us and says, "we're not open".  At first we think she's kidding, but no, apparently not.  No explanation, no nothing.  So after a moment of awkward silence we turn around and look for another establishment in Old Town Scottsdale that will take our money, and hopefully is actually open for business when all signs seem to point to yes.    Rude!

Finally returned to celebrate my friend's birthday.  We got some restaurant menu items which included the EVO salad which seemed popular based on reviews.  It had a few fried kale leaves, pancetta, cheese and some brussel sprouts, etc.  I thought it was promising but not especially great.  I actually don't like the fried leaves as it didn't do anything for the salad and just tasted bitter.  The steak was very bland so I requested salt (there are no shakers on the tables!).  The potatoes were seasoned and fried well, but somehow they missed the steak?  I even tried eating the potatoes and the fried onions with the steak but it was still too bland.  The sauce it was on didn't do much at all to help, it really didn't have a strong flavor of anything..  I also tried the sole which was a step up from fish sticks.  The pasta was actually decent - like a better version of chef boyardee.  The noodles may actually be freshly made as they had a decent texture to it.  If the sauce was better I would have tried coming back for pasta later.  They ran out of Nutella for dessert so we got chocolate torte instead.  It's pretty rare for me to throw away a chocolate torte but that's basically what I did...  it tasted very odd and dry.  Thankfully we had a birthday cake alternative.  I really don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

We got to try a lot of things because we had a prixe fixe dinner Living Social voucher.  It was AWESOME!  First, its nice to have attentive waitstaff that's attentive as well as knowledgeable about the food.  Always positive, no attitude - we all know this can ruin any meal if you have poor service.  Its also nice when the manager or owner of the establishment seems to care that things are going well.  The place is definitely well run and the food came out at appropriate times.  For appetizers we got the green bean salad and the pork belly.  Both were different enough to be interesting but worked well enough that it wasn't weird.  Portions were decent and there was just the right amount of seasoning on both.   For entrees we got gnocchi and salmon.  Salmon was deliciously cooked with the skin on - I'd forgotten how good just plain salmon can be with just some salt.  The waiter warned me that the gnocchi is thicker than the traditional potato kind which I definitely appreciated.  It was a bit thick, but I'm still glad I got it because the red sauce was one of the best I've had.  It wasn't too thick or thin, too salty, too sweet.  Pretty perfect.  They could have been a tiny bit more sausage but really, its a great dish.  For dessert we chose both of the specials they had that evening - carrot cake and velvet cake with mascarpone gelato.  The carrot cake was different, kind of like moist sponge cake but still very good.  The velvet cake presentation was pretty and you can't go wrong with cake and ice cream.  :)  We will definitely be returning as long as their standards don't change for the worst!

I would not have found the place if I didn't read the reviews.  Its an outdoor seating area that is next to the entrance to Monti's across from the park.  Even as we approached I wasn't sure, then realized their shirts say Tempe's Front Porch.  So I think they're trying to be a hip young place.  Its a great spot for people watching for sure.  The food's not terrible, but also nothing to write home about.  We got the fries - sweet and regular which was nice.  It came with 3 sauces that were all every sweet...  Not a huge fan of them.  I ended up using the sauce from the chorizo stuffed dates (bbq).  The fries were crisp though and not too greasy or salty.  The short rib tacos were ok, the meat was slightly on the dry side.  Can use a little more than shredded lettuce on top.  The chicken lollipops were just pieces of grilled chicken with Red Hot on it.  Not impressed at all.  The yukon potato dish was terrible.  Its a slice of deep fried potato (think extra thick kettle chip) with shredded meat/chorizo(?) on top with some sour cream and a slice of raw jalapeno on top of it all.  Raw.  Poor plan, poor execution - zero points for this dish.  The chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon was actually pretty good, also hard to mess up.  Had bbq sauce on it.    Everything came with a splash of red pepper flakes and parsley on top.    Its a neat little spot to hang out in, but I have to agree with the others that the service is on the slow side.  We almost had a 1:1 server to customer ratio and it was still slow so I can only imagine.  The service was friendly and willing - just very slow.  The food is NOT very impressive.  I think an above average home cook would easily come up with better dishes than these.  Happy hour deals aren't great either because the portion size is very small.  If anything it's priced right.  I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.

We wanted to use a Groupon that included 2 flights of wine and a shared plate.  They refused to honor the Groupon because it was during their happy hour.  The Groupon isn't for a dollar amount so why does it matter??  I actually made the trip out there before learning of this since they didn't put this restriction on the deal so I was very unhappy.  The food was actually decent, and I wish I could have had some wine with it.  I could see how it could have went well together.  However, I was not going to pay a cent more than I needed to satiate my hunger at this point.    I will say though that there was a piece of lint/animal hair in the hummus nacho plate and there were a couple of flies that we couldn't get rid of so I have to say that I'm not sure about the cleanliness of the establishment.  The service was great, but its such a shame that the manager in charge at the time was so unreasonable about the Groupon deal.  Their hours are so limited during the week so really you have about an hour window to use this for dinner unless you want to eat late.  I try not to eat past 7pm so this Groupon is pretty much dead to me.

We decided to go to this rehabbed church for cinco de mayo.  The atmosphere is so cool with the stained glass windows and mural on the wall.  The bar looks awesome, though we sat in the booth.  That tacos are mostly good.  There were very few that I didn't like.  During happy hour, the taco of the day (that day was pork carnita) is only 2 dollars.  We got 3 tacos (you get 1 free side then and the rice is a must try) and 3 of the happy hour tacos and were stuffed at the end of it.    Like I said the rice is awesome.  Its got more flavor that you typically get, bits of corn also adds to the appeal.  I really liked the pork adovada and the carnita.  The others were decent but not too exciting - shrimp, duck, guild chicken.  A definite must try if only for the scene!

The place looks divey which usually is very promising for a barbeque place.  The meat however is not seasoned very well and cooked a bit to the dry side.  The sauces were decent but none could stand by themselves (I mixed the house with the ghost pepper to achieve decent flavoring).  The sides were decent, however, again lacked enough seasoning.  This was pretty much across the board from cole slaw to macaroni and cheese.  The meat also lacked a smokey flavor which makes me wonder how exactly they cooked them.

When I go to a fancy breakfast place, I look for reasons to even be there instead of Ihop, Denny's, etc because A - its usually more expensive and B - its hard to improve on eggs over easy and bacon and these places are solid.    I was going to get the breakfast pot pie but from the description it seemed less like a pie, more like a biscuit and gravy dish with a pie crust in place of biscuit.  I'm glad I asked because that's exactly what it was.  So I got the BLT instead.  Yea, it had a fancy pesto mayo on it and some kinda soft cheese but other than that, its your basic BLT and regular bacon (described as soft belly bacon).  It was good, but not good enough that I'd ever order this again.  I tried my friend's 3-ingredient omelet (sausage, cheddar and mushroom) and it was kind of dense and flavorless.  The hash browns are better than I thought they'd be, as they were shredded potatoes in the shape of a cylinder with only the top part crispy and I usually like these fried parts the best.  Nothing really special about them besides the shape.  Really, the only thing I've ever heard people rave about this place is the pancake flight deal so I won't fully dismiss the place til I've tried a pancake.  I probably won't be clamoring to be back anytime soon though.

This is definitely a solid place.  We had the chicken salad and the primo(?) - prosciutto, arugula, parmesan pizza.  The dressing for the salad was better balanced than most places which I definitely noticed (my tongue is very sensitive to acidic and salty food).  The pizza was tasty, though it had a bit too much ash and burn on it for my taste.  The pizza also had a tough time holding together for bites, smaller pieces of prosciutto should help.    The free limoncello shots and powder sugar dusted fried dough were a nice touch to make this place stand out.    I think I like Cibo better, but this place is a solid second for this type of pizza.

Overrated.  I got one of the "supreme" hotdogs or whatever which was a dollar more ($9.50ish).  It sounded good, brat cooked in beer, covered with saurkraut and bacon.  The brat was as big as a pointer finger and the pretzel bun was slightly larger than a dinner roll.  So picture pig in blanket with much larger roll and a pig that's just a little bigger.  Not proportional, and kind of messy - people get this off a truck and are able to eat it without a fork and knife??  The pita bread with pimento cheese was actually very good, however, the bread was SO greasy.  We were thinking we should go back for this and beer, but realized its probably not a great idea.  Maybe the dogs off the truck are a little bigger?  It would definitely have to be several dollars cheaper for this to work..  The beer selection was pretty good though and value priced.

I really really wanted to like it.  Its very authentic, unfortunately not everyone from a foreign place is a great cook...  The mini chimichangas were probably the best part of the meal though one of them had unrolled a bit in the frying process.  They put shredded meat, red onion and green and red peppers in it which was a nice touch.  Then it goes downhill...  Carne asada - the meat was very grisley and rather bland.  It wasn't cooked great, had a weird coloring.  The fajita platter - the chicken was basically a flattened, pan fried salt and pepper seasoned meat.  Shrimp was also not interesting.  The meat was the same as carne asada.  They're very nice and all.  I wish the food and the general order of the place was a little better..

So we went for Arizona Restaurant Week and you should know, the appetizer and dessert are half portions.  The entrees seem to be full though.  The chopped salad is awesome.  I love it at CPH and its the same here.  My friend had the tomato bisque which is fine - just reminds me of Chef Boyardi ravioli sauce minus the little bits of "meat".  The chicken dish is awesome.  Its a bit small, and spicy but the potatoes definitely even it out.  I would definitely go back to have some more of that.  The meatloaf wasn't as impressive but its a solid and savory offering.  Definitely don't need ketchup.  :)  The peach cobbler had some grainy powder on it that I didn't care for.  Maybe they should've gone more for doughy crumbles versus the weird dry powdery crumble.  The creme fraiche had no flavor.  The bread pudding was much better.  Way better than a lot of other attempts that I have had.  I was sad to see Ruth Chris go, but was impressed with the redesign.  They might want to help visitors with the south entrance though, its a little disconcerting to walk through a glass door that almost looks like it should be locked and the place isn't open.  That leads down some stairs and leads you to a hallway with restrooms and a bar.  The hostess on the other side of the room so she doesn't see you when you walk in..  I kind of wonder if people are really walking in off Camelback?  Anyway, my rating would really be 3.5 but will round up for great service and nice atmosphere.

We started with a spot of butternut squash soup.  It wasn't much to look at but it was very tasty presented in tiny mugs with little walnut and bacon(?) on top.  The next course was lamb riblets.  They were pretty good with the pickled onions.  The meat doesn't really fall off the bone and the cut is pretty fatty so there isn't much meat on them.  So beware if you're on a date needing to impress!  The chopped salad as always is one of my favorite things to get here and at the Citizen Public House.  I chose the scallops as my entree which was also very awesome.  They were super soft served on a bed of grits and rapini(?).  I was going to pack up half of it but plowed right through because it was so delicious.    Dessert was bread pudding which came with a delicious caramel sauce.  It was actually quite dense for a bread pudding, it came out more like a cheese cake.  The bits with sauce and caramelization was very good, however, the rest of it was just a big old sponge that wasn't worth the calories to me.  I noticed the venue did a much better job in putting up signs and instruction for when you enter the restaurant from the parking lot (the old Ruth Chris entrance).  The service was top notch.  I think this may be one of the better restaurants in Phoenix and happy hour is definitely worth a visit.

I can see why this place has a high rating.  You feel bad not rating them high because they're cute, just obviously struggling.  It's a quaint little place with 2 people working.  This means service will be slow.  This also means they don't need much more than 2 people because there is nothing really to bring people in.  Their food looks like typical fare with a $2 "quaint" tax added to the price tag.  The coffee is interesting until you try it and it has nothing but sweetened flavored milk in it.  Seriously, don't get the large because you hardly taste any coffee in it.  This place is selling itself as a hidden gem, but really the only way it would work is if it's in a lesser known corner of the Desert Botanical Garden or something.

I decided to stop in for some baked goods and coffee for dessert after lunch.  We found ourselves at the counter between 2 registers not being helped due to our unfortunate location whilst perusing the baked goods display.  Whatever.  We ordered an almond cookie, a chocolate macaroon and a chocolate almond croissant.  This came out to about 10 dollars.  Seeing as I didn't see coffee on the menu and had no idea what kind of pricing they decided to place on it I decided to get  the coffee elsewhere.  Make sure you watch them fill your order, the lady tried to give me a regular chocolate croissant.  So the macaroon I decided I like.  Its like a dense raw-in-the-middle brownie.  Or a truffle brownie dumpling.  Delightful.    The cookie is mediocre.  I don't think I'd get it again.  The chocolate almond croissant was DELICIOUS!  Then I uncovered a short black curly hair that I couldn't come up with any alternative for besides originating from someone's lower pubic region.    For the price they charge for their goods, I should be able to expect a hairless experience.  Even if it was a head hair or an eyelash I may have just brushed it off, no pun intended.

We had the crab stuffed mushrooms which were very different from what I'd imagined.  Its basically a large ball of crab with a little mushroom on it (think crab ball with hat) covered in panko and fried.  Sounds weird, but its actually pretty dang good.  Its a little tricky to eat but I'd definitely recommend trying it if you like crab.  We also had the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and one that I don't remember the name of..  They were decent, slightly too much rice and slightly off in the slicing but priced very right even without a special.  If you're in the mood for sushi in a bistro type environment versus a club and don't want to be reamed on pricing I would highly recommend this place!

I'll have to check out the regular menu and see what kind of portions you get to confirm, but for now this place gets a 4 star rating from me.  It's a very cozy but well-designed bar atop Gelato Spot.  Its really neat the way they have a viewing glass sky light type thing that looks into the Gelato Spot from the restaurant as well.  They also have a patio that we were able to enjoy because it's still not too hot.  Not the loveliest view, but definitely interesting being able to look down at the comings and goings of Scottsdale Rd.    The staff was VERY attentive.  Can they be a little less attentive?  Maybe just a smidge..  but it was mostly a nice attentive.  On the other hand dinner took about 2 hours.  It was the 3 course for restaurant week, but there were long gaps in between courses.  Not overly annoying tonight, but we were glad we didn't have any other plans.  For 1st course we had the beet mix and the quail.  Both were very delicious and presented beautifully.  The next course was scallops and chicken for us.  The scallops were done perfectly and seasoned pretty well.  I wish more potatoes came on the platter, less carrots but other than that no complaints.  Maybe some arugula or some green would have been pretty.  It was still one of the best scallop dish I've ever had.  The chicken worked less well, we thought the blue cheese though spotty was a bit strong.  It also needed a little more salty meat - sausage or more prosciutto maybe?  The last but not least course was foie gras and veal chop.  It was actually our first time tasting foie gras - though I don't think we'll ever miss it, it wasn't bad and I believe it to be a solid representation of the delicacy.  The veal was tasty, presented nicely in slices over some grainy base.  This dish was also very good but could have used a little sweetness (cranberries?).  All in all, this was a very enjoyable dinner with dishes that were well thought out.  Everyone we talked to were helpful and not pretentious at all which was refreshing.  We're glad we tried it out.  Happy hour didn't seem to include any food items which was disappointing as we're not big drinkers, but I think I would like to return to try some more offerings even at regular pricing.

Really, really good.  I'd shave off half a star for being a little too salty, but otherwise this place sets the bar for barbeque.  Definitely one of the best bbq I've had in a long time.  Try the pecan pie!  It's 5 bucks, but it's worth it!

Angry crab is better.  The tables are lined with plastic and you get bibs and even plastic gloves but the gloves are just about useless after a few minutes.  Then you don't even get waste buckets so you're just making a mess pile and eating on the mess pile.  The logistics are just so much tighter at angry crab but I also thought the flavors didn't really get into the seafood as well at this place either.  I'm not sure, but I think they don't have beer either.  :/

In short, just another Scottsdale hack of a restaurant.  I really do not understand how they got all these positive reviews, though if you peruse the highlights they don't seem to mention anything specific.  Our meals were off today so we came in for dinner around 450pm.  The place was pretty dead as expected.  They started to seat us in the main dining room and then changed course to the sectioned off area which wasn't bad until a baby started screaming.  The little section is nice and cozy but has nothing to absorb sound so even with the family and us it got loud enough to have to yell.  The decor is very nice.  I really like the finishes they chose and the furniture is pretty classic.  There are numerous TVs which were nice too since we wanted to watch football.  There were actually 2 in the little living room and they were kind enough to change the channel so we can watch both the 49ers/seahawks and broncos/chargers game.  The service was VERY slow considering there were all of 3 tables to serve in the whole place, but we didn't mind til the end of the game.  I guess maybe they want to keep the Sandbar vibe alive?  Anyway, the food:  we started with the pretzels - basically 3 pretzel rolls.  They were actually pretty good.  They came with a mustard vinaigrette that I thought was creative (my friend did not like it much) and a cheese sauce that I thought was not very good.  I'm not sure if it was their take on pimento cheese?  It was decent, but here's the thing - it was 10 bucks and some places give it away with dinner.  It wasn't special enough or portioned well enough to warrant the price tag.  I got the taco plate - they didn't have duck so I took the chicken, beef, and fish.  They all sounded good with different slaws and aoli, etc.  Unfortunately they meant sliced cabbage and carrots and not a whole lot of sauce you can taste.  One of the tacos had kale and half of the pieces in the taco were yellow.  The chicken taco somehow was so soggy that the tortilla was soaked through before the plate got to the table.  The tacos were pretty inedible by themselves, I would definitely recommend asking for some hot sauce or salsa.    My friend had the standard burger and it actually came with the best thing we had there - fries.  The $15 burger was pretty lame - 2 slices of bacon that wasn't crisped enough and weren't thick enough and a slice of cheese on a thick greasy patty.  The meat actually had seasoning in it but damn, this is their namesake burger and it was all brown and gray.  Except for the patty - that was pretty red in the middle (they didn't ask..).  No pickle, tomato, onion, or lettuce.  We were so disappointed in the food, we will probably not feel adventurous for a while!

You almost want to ruin their perfect rating but there was absolutely nothing to complain about!  It's located right off the parking garage at the Esplanade.  They left the design and layout roughly the same as before.  Nothing too fancy, maybe a little on the masculine side but very comfortable and nice.    Service was awesome, everyone seems so friendly!  It was kind of like Winco - is everyone part owner?  I've never actually been but....  The happy hour is ridiculous!  I say they bought the raters off by having such great prices for their happy hour.  We seriously got one of everything and it came to about 20 bucks.  Cocktails are $5, all beers are $3 and their selection is pretty good.  They also have wines which is the going rate of $5 but I bet they don't try to give you crap wine but can't really say for sure.  Anyway, the prices are so low, I can't believe it wasn't packed to the gills.  The food selections themselves were all very delicious.  I tried the shrimp and gritcake, fried green tomatoes, beef tacos, fish tacos, and hush puppies.  They're all varying degrees of awesome.  We also got the steak and fries which was perfectly cooked to order.  Simply seasoned and super tender.  The fries were actually good!  Lately it seemed like everywhere we went, we got the limp skin on greasy fries reminiscent of the local grease spot.  So much so that I thought maybe it's a trendy thing right now (though not for me).  Not here - awesome, nicely cut and nicely fried with a bit of salt.  Perfect!  This is hands down my favorite happy hour spot.  I hope I don't eat them outta business!  ;)

I guess we were lucky - we didn't have to wait at all for dinner!  The establishment is so neat - it's almost like picnic area in a large cabin, which given what they do is just perfect.  They have a large industrial size sink you can wash your hands at before and/or after you eat and they provide you with bibs which judging from the butter spatters on the paper in front of me afterwards was a must.  The beer selection is awesome and reasonably priced.  They have the seafood boils which you can make your own by picking what kind of sauce, what level of spiciness and how much (if any) corn, sausage or potatoes you want in it.  They also have the barbeque which was as good as the seafood boil we got.  There's more sides and po boys etc you can get too but we didn't get that far.  We got the 2 meat platter with baby back ribs and brisket.  It would've been solid at a barbeque restaurant!  The sides could be a little better.. we got the beans and cole slaw.  They were decent but lacked a bit of flavor.  I loved that they served it with a thick piece of white bread!  For the seafood boil we got the crawfish with trifecta sauce to medium spiciness.  It was just perfect!  Next time we'll probably try it with shrimp though because there's not a lot of pay off for meat there.  I learned later you're supposed to get like 2-3 lbs crawfish per person.  I absolutely love this place.  It's so fun and the pricing's actually reasonable.  The food comes out quickly and their beer and food selections are great.  They have TVs and a patio - what more can you ask for?

Seems like they're losing it a bit.  We went around 2pm which I would've expected it to be slower but it wasn't.  It didn't take long before we were seated but they said something like someone will be with you as soon as they can......  Turned out to be a little longer than I thought, but once the contact was made things moved a bit quickly and fairly smoothly.   He forgot to offer us bibs and my friend got sauce splattered on his shirt.  He also came through to clear our table without checking with us first so we were basically told we were done eating.  It was just so quick we couldn't stop him before he put garbage on our tray.   Seems like it was either they were short handed somehow or the waiter was just antsy and not organized.  The place wasn't full but busier than I would've thought at 2.  Excuses aside, they still have a fairly good product at a reasonable price.

I'm a fan!!  I like the decor, there's a large patio space and there is plenty of room inside that kinda reminds me of a standard Mexican restaurant but with splotches of chic vintage decor.  Happy hour deal is awesome.  Taco Mondays are awesome.  The pricing is not even close to greedy which is rare in Old Town.  The food is good too!  We tried just about one of every taco and the only one I was a little disappointed by was the skirt steak one - needs more flavor.  BUT this can be easily remedied by a large array of sauces/salsas that come to the table with your food!  We also tried the fish taco which was excellent.  The braised pork and chicken ones are solid.    Its so refreshing to find an establishment in Old Town that's just so good all around!  Great food, great service, AND great pricing??  This is one of my favorite spots already!

I'm not sure about this place.  The sandwiches and the mixed green side salad are priced way higher than their worth - though you get like a full quarter cup of dressing for like 20 leaves of lettuce.  The steak sandwich was pretty bland and not very special.  My friend got the chicken sandwich which was better, but they toast the bread so it really cuts into your mouth trying to eat it.  I'd rather go to Jimmy Johns and hit a Starbucks.  Maybe the protein shakes are better?

Definitely one of my favorite spots now!  Pizzetta and charcuterie board are pretty good deals at happy hour.  Wasn't a huge fan of the Nutella calzone, though it sounded really good.  Maybe with a lighter or slightly sweetened dough it might be better?  Really great beer selection and love the casual atmosphere.

They were super accommodating with my large party, even letting us hog the large tables in front of the bar because my friends wanted to watch basketball.  The service was kind of spotty with our party though, some people at the end of the table were complaining of being ignored by the same waitress that was super attentive to my side of the table.  There was another server helping that was kind of aggressive...  but overall I thought the service was ok.  The cheese plate was huge.  It seemed like the cheeses were kind of boring but the frills were adventurous (like pickled red peppers).  My favorite item on the board was the caramelized cashews.  The calamari was cooked perfectly.  The figs, fried cauliflower, sweet potato tots were all as expected and ho hum.  Overall I think the food is good, but not memorable or distinctive in any way.  That's fine, as long as it's consistent right?  Cocktails were pretty solid.  Their beer selection was interesting, though I think it wasn't too appealing to me.    Overall, a pretty nice time!  The food's solid, although if you're not there for happy hour it might be a little pricey for what it is.  Most of their cocktails were pretty tasty and appealing so it would be an excellent venue for such a thing.  :)

Solid fast casual.  Mahi mahi with the tomato sauce was pretty good, not dry at all.  I loved the cole slaw!!!!  I think the concept is pretty cool, but the prices seem a wee bit high.  I'd like to try the steak next time.  The portions are solid and the food is a little elevated so it may justify the price if they are consistent and bring the same quality more often than not.

It's a work in progress so it's kind of tricky to find it.  On the bright side, it's got a nice big parking lot so it isn't a hassle to go.  The Pineapple Propeller is the best cocktail I've probably ever had.  I usually don't drink cocktails but I would definitely go back for this one.  The Okra Cup was ok and is on the happy hour list but nothing to write home about.  We tried the divoli (?) flatbread which is basically a pepperoni pizza (very red peppery pepperoni).  The wings were seasoned well and grilled, though a bit too much.  They were tiny and a good portion of them were completely black on one side.  The fried cheese balls are actually fried mac and cheese balls.  The fried chicken skin was just that, with a sweet sauce on top.  Overall, the food was nothing too special.  I wouldn't come for happy hour food, maybe I'll try an entree next time to go with the Pineapple Propeller.

Just no...  The people seem pretty nice.  They have some kind of $3 beer special that sounds interesting.  They also have a fridge with Mexican version of sodas in there which I wish I saw coming in.  We took our food to go since we had groceries in the car.  Carne asada platter and carnitas platter.  The carne asada was cut into long thin strips of overcooked dry meat.  They lacked flavor and kinda seemed reheated.  The carnitas were better.  At about 15 a piece, I've never been so underwhelmed with the portion of rice and beans we got with the meal.  The meat portion was probably closer to a $7 meal elsewhere.  The pico de gallo was decent, and the guacamole is overmixed and underseasoned.  I think this place could be fun to drink in with a large group, but eating the food sober is not fun.  The prices are even less fun.  I will definitely stick to the more authentic spots nearby.

A little hefty for donuts, especially the puny ones, but must admit they're creative, enticing, and pretty good!  Iced coffee was good too, not bitter!
