Ummm, just ordered delivery from here and the pizza is total crap! Do not order if you like pizza lol! It is worse than digornos or any frozen pizza. Should have went to Safeway and got a frozen one, would have been much better. I have no idea about the other food they offer but please,  stay away if you are going to order pizza. It is crap!

My husband and I had looked forward to trying this place all day. When we arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night there was a note on the door stating their lights and AC had went out. We peeked our heads in and asked if they were open. The hostess explained that they could cook, but there was no AC so it was probably a little too warm to dine in (the power had went out about 15 minutes before we arrived.)  We came in and sat down in the empty restaurant and the cook and hostess were so nice! They took our order and actually cooked it by flashlight. The decor of the place is actually pretty nice and quaint for a typical "strip mall" type place. I was kind of disappointed that we couldn't stay and dine there.  As for the food: We ordered the chicken satay as an appetizer and ate it there while we waited. It was amazing. The peanut sauce and whatever the other sauce it comes with was excellent.  The Pad Thai was pretty good. I would definitely eat it again.   The Tom Yum Seafood soup is the most amazing soup ever! It is a little spicy (we ordered medium) so I wouldn't suggest getting it hot unless you are willing to breathe fire!  The Pa-Nang is also fantastic. My husband ordered it hot, and it definitely was, but not so hot that you couldn't taste all the flavors. It was also excellent.  TL/DR: This place is excellent, definitely worth trying if you like Thai food

I love this place! Compares to Barros but better and cheaper! Me, my hubby, and our kids all love the pizza and wings here. The wings are meaty and definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings. To feed a family of 4 when 3 out of 4 are men/ boys you can't beat it! Screw the pizza huts and papa johns chain pizza joints and check this place out. Delivery is fast and they are always nice. Our delivery place since we first tried it and from now on.

Got delivery since Sui wok never answers their phone. Will never  do it again. Their hot and sour soup was so nasty. Just dark brown liquid and nothing else in it. Could not even take one spoonful. My husband loves orange chicken a hated it from this place. The egg rolls tasted horrible too. Trust the reviews on this one and stay away.

Ok so we have been waiting for this place to open! We love ramen made traditionally! It was really good and you can customize your order. It was a bit more expensive than  republic ramen but loved the owner and staff here. They were way cool and gave us samples of the 3 different broth choices when we asked. I def would go again based on the service. They just opened and will be adding more to the menu soon :) yay!

Me and the hubby got take out here for dinner. He got Mika ' s fries which were amazing and definitely worth 5.95! I got a falafel pita with side Greek salad. Both were yummy! Our total was just $15. Has a good atmosphere ans modern decor. We would totally go back again. Sad they don't have Greek lemon chicken soup though.
