I saw Dr. Stephen Walker for a root canal last week. I have to say he was amazing! He was gentle, down to earth, and explained the procedure. His hygienist was amazing as well. Very comforting and caring. I would highly recommend this practice.

I met a girlfriend for an impromptu pedi. I Yelped his place before making the appointments. It was okay, nothing special, my pedi is chipping one week later, and the same goes for my gel manicure. I have my cosmetology license and almost always do my own nails, let this be a reminder of why I do my own. I would definitely not recommend this salon.

Bulwark was recommended though a family member that used them as well. I had a very good experience to start with however after a year their "technicians" and customer service only got worse. Not only were they unable to eradicate my springtail problem they identified the problem pests as "mites" I had to investigate and correctly identify the problem myself. As far as service goes, the techs showed up late, hours, not minutes and sometimes didn't show at all.. When they increased the monthly service fee I continued service, trusting that the company was solid and had trustworthy workers coming into my home. I spoke to the owner of the company, and he seemed to actually care and wanted to address my needs with a more experienced tech, but nothing changed. My sister and I discontinued service.

Just a quick update. I was contacted by the owner of the company after my post. He reimbursed me for the last three service calls. He was very understanding and apologetic. I believe he also offered me six months of free service. This shows me that Bulwark has company values and values their customers.

I was a little skeptical, going to a new hair stylist for color when my last hair stylist, which I've gone to for 15 years didn't do what I wanted. Brandon listened to me and did a great job! My hair is awesome! The staff is fun and friendly, atmosphere is relaxed but not over relaxed. Brandon not only did a great job but I felt like I had been going to him for years! Great people skills and it's easy to see he loves what he does. I was a hair stylist for 7 years so I know how hard the business is. I would highly recommend this salon.
