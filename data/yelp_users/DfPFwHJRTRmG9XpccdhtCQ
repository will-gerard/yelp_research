Awful place to live with new office staff. I have lived here for 5 years and now with new office staff nothing is ever done when you put in maintenance requests. My car got broken into twice so I asked then to replace the burnt out lights around my building. I have asked 5 times and they are still out. Walking my dog at night is a nightmare with all the lights out, not only is it dark but we are living in a construction site with equipment and fencing all around that people can hide behind(even worse with not lights).  Oh and the "upgrades" they are putting in never have people working on them, which means you live in a construction site for even longer! I think they have run out of money to pay the contractors because everyone is moving out. Don't fall for there advertising, that's all it is, they won't do shit for you after you sign the papers!

After using Black and White Limo it is easy to say that they are the only way to ride. The drivers are always on time and usually early and will be waiting for you with a cold water and could not be more professional. The SUVs are so clean and have so much space it makes it easy to get your whole group anywhere.   I now use Black and White whether it is just an airport drop/pick up or going out for the night in Scottsdale. It is so nice not having to wait for just another taxi driver, with Black and White they really treat you like family.... Greatest service ever!!!!!
