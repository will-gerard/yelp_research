Over 150 reviews for you to read about this mediocre steakhouse.  I ordered the St. Louis pork ribs which were very tender but slathered in a cloyingly sweet bbq sauce. The corn on the cob was more like creamed corn on the cob, been in hot water a long long time!  Their cowboy beans were average at best,  My wife had the all white meat fried chicken, fairly good and lots of it (3 breasts with the bone deep fried) but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy, enough to sparely cover one breast.  The salad needed more dressing but was refreshing.  Best part of the meal was the Indian fry bread. The green beans were semi cooked and unseasoned.  The place was extremely noisy and on top of that a band played in the background.  I left with a headache and a resolve to never return for a $40+ meal.

If you go to their website and check their business hours you will learn they are NOT open for lunch (I wasted a trip because of this :( i makes me not want to try again when they can't keep a simple website accurate!

It has been over a year since we ate here but a groupon set it up.  I had remembered that we liked the food a lot and was happy to try again.  It was 6pm on a Sunday night and they were just about full!  Our waiter, an older gentleman, took good care of us, he was quite busy but he didn't overlook us.  The bread, which I had remembered to be very good, still was, hot, soft focacia served with a small plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It was already poured and it had more vinegar than we wanted.  We ordered ravioli di pollo e portobello (chicken and mushrooms) and linguini vongole, cozze, e calamari (mussels, clams and squid), both $17.  The ravioli were delicious, 6 of them in a creamy mushroom sauce, and the linguini were covered in jet black mussel shells, small white clam shells and squid rings in a tomato based broth.  I ordered the red rather than the white sauce.  They put on as much parmesan cheese as you wanted, even if excessive!  I am taking away a half star for the pre-poured oil and vinegar and for the pre-grated cheese.  Our waiter did everything you would want except smile and show a bit of personality.  This is not a complaint but an observation.  Arrivederci is a 4.5 star restaurant with moderate prices and a lovely ambiance.

Almost a year since we last ate here and not much has changed.  With a four star rating that's not a bad thing.  I noticed, depending on what you order, the size of the portions vary but in general were good sized.  I had chicken (large lovely and well cooked breast) and my wife had veal (3 rather thin pieces), both accompanied by a small portion of sauced penne pasta.  I thought the tomato based sauce on my pasta didn't have much flavor character, too bland for me.  A big disappointment was the bread.  They used to bake their own very tasty flat-bread in the pizza oven, but now just an average Italian bread was served.  Service is still very good, prices still moderate with majority of dishes going between $14 to $20 and some specials between $24 to $28.  The dip for the bread was still a mix of balsamic vinegar and olive oil and I had to ask for oil alone.  Pregrated cheese still there, but I would come back and order chicken rather than veal.  The atmosphere is still lovely, allthough the leather booth seating is beginning to crack and needs some repair.  I say give it a try, I will again.

I get confused when the name of the place changed from Native New Yorker to Native Grill & Wings....  yet the reviews are still under NNY.  We have eaten here since 1979 where it all started in Tempe.  We have noticed the wings seem to get smaller and smaller as time goes by.  Maybe they are Cornish Game Hen wings or pigeon wings but hey, we have NEVER seen wings that small!  They taste good but you need at least twice the number to fill up.  My previous review was 5 stars but that was many years ago, how sad.  Goodbye NNY/NGW, sad to see you change like that.

Lily, the owner/operator of this dry cleaning shop is a very interesting lady!  She does all the alterations at very fair prices.  She is a rather small in stature oriental woman who hand makes most of the local police custom fitted bullet proof vests and has pictures on the wall showing her with all these armed men!  We have been taking our dry cleaning to her for the past 8 years and have never had a complaint about her work.  She has done lots of hemming and other alterations, quickly and neatly at a decent price.  She even monogrammed a piece for me.  It's truly a mom and pop business, her husband is frequently there too.  We get our clothing back quickly and always as promised!  She's just south of Baseline on the east side of Dobson.

Environment is interesting albeit needing some clean up, staff is friendly and efficient!  Now for the negatives: this is definitely an Americanized Italian food place.  All the pastas were overcooked and overpriced.  The main dishes were not very flavorful, chicken was tender, seafood overcooked, sauces uninspired.  I love warm bread but the garlic mozzarella bread was almost inedible I'm sad to say.  The desert had mostly whipped cream, a little ice cream and a chunk of brownie.  Overall impression is overpriced, over cooked, under flavored.  There is no way I will be back!

It was Super Bowl evening and I thought it would be perfect to avoid the evening crowd at the Roadhouse!  Little to no traffic and I was right, plenty of parking at the restaurant.  My wife ordered the 8oz sirloin and it was delectable, grilled perfectly, tender and delicious.  I ordered a half rack of ribs as I have had them before and they were always fabulous.  It didn't work out that way however.  They were burned black and dry and chewy.  I took one bite and returned them,  You get 2 sides with your meal, the wife had a loaded baked potato which she said was "really really nice", and I ordered the steak fries, which were just OK.  Our second side was the house salad, cold, crisp fresh lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheddar, croutons, and chopped hard boiled eggs, a truly lovely salad!  The waiter agreed with me that the ribs were burnt and I wonder why he didn't do anything about it before he served them.  I had to wait almost half an hour for it's replacement and by then the wife had finished eating and I had lost my appetite.  As usual it was very very loud with the three major sources of noise being generated, the guests, the staff singing Happy Birthday and the overhead sound system playing loud music.  Several staff members apologized for the ribs and I was told I wouldn't be charged for them.  They even offered to send a new side along with the new boxed ribs, I declined.  There was a bucket of fresh tasting large peanuts on the table which I am sure helped cut my appetite in absence of my ribs.  We will probably return again some time in the future to give them another chance.

One must overcome the look of the neighborhood and it's neighbor "soup kitchen". I used to volunteer at this "soup kitchen"  and the street people are not a danger to this neighborhood.  The restaurant is a large and open room with about 10 booths and 20 tables, an aquarium and loud loud Mexican music!  Did I mention it is loud?  Five or six waitresses, friendly, helpful and patient rush about serving the quests.  A Friday early evening, my wife and I were the only non latinos in the place.  The food was as beautiful as it was excellent.  We ordered shrimp quesadillas (9.99) and a deep fried whole red snapper in garlic sauce (13.99) both excellent. The portions were huge!!  The snapper was 12 to 14 inches long!  I have taken off one star for the overly loud music.  The bathroom and restaurant were clean and service was good.  We will surely return! Perhaps with ear plugs :)

A small place in a small strip mall shared with Nello's Pizza and a counselor off of Alma School just south of Guadaloupe Rd.  It was a Wednesday lunch and quite busy.  They are really fast however and very friendly as well.  I have eaten here several times over the years but my review is not to be found.  I didn't find the place dirty like one reviewer wrote, I thought it was clean and bright.  Their pulled pork is wonderful and full over flavor although a bit salty.  I love their lomi lomi salmon and yes this was very reminiscent of Hawaii.  Well made white rice, 2 big scoops on their daily Hawaii Special plate $9.95 and enough to eat for 2 hungry people!  I wanted to try their Poke but it is only available on Saturday.  Nice varied menu, check them out and leave room for the Guava cake!!

I have been getting takeout from this restaurant for at least the past 4 or 5 years and it appears to be rather exclusively a take out place.  I have to say they have been consistent with their quality, large portion sizes and efficiency!  Over all the food is delicious and very much like New York style Chinese food.  They have 3 or 4 tables but I have never seen anyone eating there but they do a huge take out business.  When you go to pick up your order you can observe 3 to 4 chefs feverishly working at huge woks, it's fun to watch.  You get great value as the ingredients are fresh and abundant and inexpensive.  I enjoy their hot and sour soup, especially at $3.25 a quart.  Last night we ordered Shrimp Royal (10.95) loaded with many strips of pork, sliced chicken breast and a dozen large shrimp, bamboo shoots, pea pods, white and green onions, all in a slightly spicy sauce, a delicious dish.  We also had House Special Chow Fun (7.75) with lots of wide flat noodles with chicken breast, bbq pork and medium shrimp and some sliced beef in a great tasting mild sauce.  Lunches average from $5 - 5.75 from 11AM -3PM. I plan to keep ordering from them, it's good stuff.

It's taken me 8 years to try China Way.  Looking back I see it as lost time.  What impressed me was the quantity of freshly cooked veggies and proteins served.   i ordered take out Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, a dish I have come to love when I lived in NYC. Instead of making the sauce with egg whites, they used the whole egg which appeared like scrambled eggs in the sauce.  I do not like scrambled eggs.  The sauce was very tasty, the onions fresh and crunchy and a least a half pound of good sized shrimp sweet and fresh tasting, perfectly cooked!  Bright green, crunchy broccoli was in the dish as well as some mushroom slices.  The best dish was Mongolian Chicken with white and green onions, ordered extra spicy.  I couldn't believe the quantity of sliced chicken breast and the great and not too spicy sauce.  Truly a 5 star dish.  All the above came with 4 very large scoops of white rice.  Fresh crunchy fortune cookies ended the meal.  Eighteen dollars and change for more food than my wife and I could actually eat.  We plan to check out many of their menu options.  How can you beat quality fresh ingredients in large quantities?

My sister invited us to have dinner with her and my brother-in-law at Flo's in the Promenade, Saturday evening at 5:30, so we could get their early bird 1/2 price appetizers!  It was a 30 minute drive for us.  I poured over at least 70 or 80 reviews that afternoon.  When it comes to oriental food there is a distinct separation into Americanized and Authentic in our population, you need to be aware of what group you belong to. Flo's is definitely for the Americanized palate:(  a group we don't belong to.  But family is family so along we went. We ordered 5 Appetizers: #1-Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings (Seasoned with spicy chile salt and tossed with bell peppers, fresh chiles, and onions) and told there would be a 15 -20 minute wait, no problem.  Also ordered #2-Thai Style Calamari & Chiles. (Breaded calamari seasoned with chile-pepper salt, diced bell peppers, green onions, and a hint of lime). Next #3-Chinese Lettuce Wraps. (Chicken in a sweet hoisin sauce with water chestnuts, mushrooms, and green onions.  #4-Pot Stickers (Pork), and #5-Singapore Chicken Satay (Skewers of tender chicken breast drenched in a rich peanut sauce). The chicken appeared to be ground and somewhat gritty but the peanut sauce was tasty and worth 2 1/2 stars. #1 & 2 were listed as spicy, - NOT, no heat at all!  The wings were crispy and had a nice flavor, alone I'd give them a 4 and the Calamari were quite tough and chewy, cut in long thick strips and had a "fishy" taste and no spicy taste I'd give a 1.  Also decided to order their Chinese Hot & Sour Soup - A thick and hearty soup made from an old village recipe with chicken, shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, eggs, cilantro, and green onions.  that had rated several rave reviews, I wonder which soup they really had.  No hint of spice, a strange aftertaste and a rather large portion that didn't taste like any other hot & sour soup we have had. Rated it a 1.  The lettuce wraps had no water chestnut crunch and little flavor and rated a 2.  The pot stickers were somewhat dry but with fair flavor and their accompanying dip needed help, gave them a 2 1/2 as I would also give the Lettuce wraps.  The restaurant environment was attractive, appeared clean with rather dim lighting.  Service was fairly good and friendly.  My bill was almost $30 without the tip. I've had better and will not return.

Disappointed, just another Mex chain restaurant.  Pro: clean and spacey, friendly staff, easy parking, very nice salsa bar with all the chips (fresh) and salsa you wish, dishes have quite large portions of pork and chicken in them as well as green pepper, their green chili sauce is very tasty.  Con: chicken has no flavor, somewhat dry, skimpy on the onions in the fajita burrito, all the sauces taste alike and none are hot, crispy taco just fell apart, was truly finger food.  I would rate them 2 1/2 stars.  Obviously, we won't be back!

I shop at this Walmart in mostly two departments, the grocery section and the pharmacy section.  I do this for one reason and that is for the savings!  When I can save well over a dollar when purchasing the margarine I like, a gallon of milk for 10 cents less than the other cheapest store, a half dollar on my grape tomatoes, less on my prescriptions, and vitamins, etc. I save a lot of money compared to my local Fry's and Safeway stores.  Haven't seen the "wild" looking people and the staff smiles and is helpful and the store is clean.  It is a bit narrower between the aisles of the newer Walmart stores but this has never been an issue.  I understand how they drive smaller businesses out but my wallet tells me to keep shopping here!

Some items are fantastic others just good. It's about 8 or 9 years that I have been getting take out from them (they do have some tables and a TV), and if you order certain items, they will blow you away! Nobody make the flavorful green chili burritos as well as they do, tastes home made and unique. They have a variety of burritos like steak, potato and cheese that is loaded with tender meat and outstanding. Shredded beef in their tacos is home cooked roast, no fat, no gristle. Service is fast, I found friendly and accurate. The place is small but clean and well lighted. Home cooked recipes from the Globe, AZ. family that started this small chain of local restaurants. They deliver and cater. There a 2 locations in Gilbert, 1 in Chandler and 1 in Mesa.

I was invited to have lunch for my birthday by a friend.  I checked the menu on line and felt it was rather limited according to my tastes and expected little pleasure from our lunch.  Boy, was I wrong!  The environment was simple, pleasant and open.  Service was slow, with a long wait for our food.  I ordered the chicken fried trout ($15) which was tasty, well prepared, with a side of slaw and nothing else.  I asked for some bread and was told they could give me crostini, five little pieces, the consistency and size of melba toast.  I also had half of my wife's order of open faced steak sandwich ($16) with blue cheese potato chips.  Nice slices of beef fillet, very tasty, as were the chips, an enjoyable combination.  The iced tea was very average.  Certainly more than a three star meal but short of five.  My friend ordered the house chopped salad with the addition of avocado and loved it.  Although the food was good I felt it was a bit overpriced, with limited choices so I probably won't return.  A slice of Birthday cake without the candle depicted in their photos and white with strawberry icing instead of what I expected from the photos of chocolate cake with white icing.  The three of us didn't finish the one piece, it was just OK, a bit heavy and on the dry side (no pastry chef involved here).

Took the wife out for her birthday, decided on the Cove.  Nice interior, pleasant and friendly staff.  Problem with being understaffed with only 2 people waiting on tables and a fairly good crowd for a Sunday evening.  Long waits, multiple times.  The bread brought to the table was quite mediocre, but the red pepper dip was flavorful and outstanding.  This started the problem, as we had a very flavorful item followed by totally bland food with little character or taste. We ordered the pork chop with polenta, the meat was rather tough and chewy, the vegetables were broccoli (overcooked) carrots (undercooked) but the polenta was tasty and perfect.  The chicken saltimboca had little taste, accompanied by overcooked penne pasta, the sauce tasted like plain canned tomatoes unseasoned, just plain unpleasant.  The chicken was tasty but somewhat overcooked and almost burned on the bottom.  We ordered a bottle of Reisling German wine which was slightly tart instead of slightly sweet.  Fortunately it was half price at $15 instead of $30, but the ice water placed on the table was good.  A very sad experience indeed, need to take the wife out again to make up for this very sub-par meal!

I noticed Wong's ratings trend has dropped recently but I can testify that they have shot right back up!  We ate here this Friday evening and had fabulous food.  My son had Beef with black bean sauce, the wife had House Special Chicken, crunchy on the outside, tender and moist breast inside. Deep fried chicken breast with orange peel sauce & water chestnuts, intense delightful flavor with just the right amount of kick, very similar to General Tso's chicken.  I ordered Szechuan Egg Plant with pork, the great flavor of perfectly cooked eggplant with tons of pork in a delicate but spicy sauce.  I don't know when I last had more flavorful, rich and tasty dishes.  Three for three, that's perfection.  Abundant portions and a spice level I enjoyed.  The service was great, the restaurant clean and the prices moderate.  I'm a fan and will definitely return many more times.

I've eaten here many times in the past 10 years and they remain consistent and give good value.  The other evening we tried a "new" dish from them, something we have eaten in many other places - spicy eggplant with pork in black-bean sauce.  Lots of small narrow eggplant in a delicious sauce but the pork was difficult to find:(  We also ordered our favorite dish (from them)   Salt and pepper Squid!!!  No one makes it as good, no one.  Tons of deep fried breaded calamari with hot peppers and spices on a bed of shredded cabbage.  Tasty tasty tasty, tender tender tender, spicy spicy spicy!  Give them a try, you won't be sorry.  The place is clean, staff polite and efficient and have been there since I started eating there in 2006!

Not my first review, certainly not just my second visit!  Enjoyed (as always) the lettuce wraps, so tasty and abundant!  We also ordered the BC Spicy Chicken, lovely dish, needed more heat for us, a kung pao dish.  Restaurant still presents a comfortable and elegant environment with excellent service and moderate prices.  Using the groupon just added to the value.

I was greatly disappointed!  Visually, this place had lovely food, but once you tasted it, little to no flavor, fatty and gristly meat and a lack of salt.  I took home 2 burros, both had rice and refried beans, one with carne asada and the other with carne al pastor.  A picture would have you salivating as I was as they assembled them. With the tax it came to 11.10.  My wife ate less than half a burro and I had to tear mine apart to salt it.  Just a poor experience.  They were quite busy a 1230 Monday lunch, I don't know why :(

Depending on what you order, Romeo's fluctuates from 4 to 5 stars and is truly a neighborhood gem!  Was there on a Tuesday evening, very quiet, good for us, bad for them.  Their entrance and parking is in the rear, lots of room.   The four of us ordered one appetizer and three entrees, which come with soup or salad.  As my yelpers warned me about the dinner salad being small and average we ordered soup of the day,  white bean and pork, which tasted wonderful but was just tepid, not hot.   Our appetizer as per the menu:  (Mushrooms Meteora: Baked button mushroom caps filled with feta cheese, capers, artichoke hearts and dill.)  Very tasty, a bit tart, lots more shredded artichoke than mushrooms. 3 - 3.5 stars. My wife had for her entree as per the menu: (Salmon De Provance: Salmon fillet baked in parchment paper with, pea pods, scallions, red peppers, asparagus, onions in a caper tomato clam sauce).  She rated it a 4.5 stars. Our friends ordered as per the menu:  (Seafood Santorini: Shrimp, calamari, capers, scallions, red peppers, basil pear tomatoes, kalamata olives with feta cheese finish).  They had been here many times and always order this dish which I assume they would rate it 4.5 -5 stars. And for me, a dish I shall never forget or even get tired of, whose flavor and goodness took me by surprise, the wonderous  and abundant pork tenderloin, as per the menu:  (Pork Molise Grilled pork tenderloin, wrapped in bacon, roasted garlic,horseradish mashed potatoes, honey caramelized onions and apricot - dark cherry sauce).  The potatoes were delightfully creamy,  mixed with small potato chunks and a mild garlic/horseradish flavor, accompanied by caramelized onions made with red wine I believe, and a fruity sauce that perfectly complemented this dish.  How can dark red ripe cherries cooked with apricots and some wine be any worse than a 5!  I give this dish a 5++ stars. It will be very very difficult not to order this dish when I return but their menu I'm sure hold more treasures.  This is truly fine dining.

During the lunch hour I purchased an 8 piece Spicy Chunky Salmon Roll to go, for my wife, who was in a rehab center in the neighborhood.  I guess raw fish is usually not served in a medical facility around here, maybe in Japan ;) The salmon tasted fresh and it was an attractive roll, $8 well spent as I wanted to increase her protein intake.  I tasted it and there was plenty of fish in small chunks, good wasabi and pickled ginger slices, rice, etc, an attractive package.  Kudos to the young man behind the counter working with an older man, probably his mentor.  The small staff was friendly and appeared efficient.  I will return to try other menu items.

I have eaten here many times in the past ten years.  This must be a compliment to the buffet that it has endured this long pleasing my palate!  Indeed a place that give value, fresh food, many choices  and pleasant staff.  They continue to offer many many food items, well over 100 choices, many from the sea, with an oriental flair.  Most of the time busy, all of the time friendly and of good value.  As time has gone by I have developed my own rhythm of food choices so that now I usually know what I am going to eat there.  I head to the back and fill a bowl with hot & sour soup.  I take a second bowl and FILL it with shrimp, mushrooms, pot-stickers, calamari, pieces of fish and meat, all scavenged from the many available items on the multiple steam tables.  Back at my table I add these items one by one to the soup and feast!  Next I go up front to the sushi station and load up on sashami, preferring the slices of salmon and tuna mostly.  I ask the sushi chef for a ball of sushi rice that he uses in his rolls and I fill  a little cup with pickled ginger and another with wasabi to mix at the table with soy sauce.  I skipped over the King crab legs, the snails, the clams, the mussels but did eat a little duck with its crispy skin and a small piece of baked teriyaki salmon.  Seconds on some more sashimi, ate at least a couple dozen slices, a bit of kimchi and 5 pieces of various sushi rolls, freshly made.  For desert I ate 2 chinese sugar donuts, 3 warm sesame balls and some sesame candy.  I went home satisfied and thinking of what my sushi would have cost at a sushi restaurant!  Here with my discount I spent less than $15.  I'll be back next month.

I began using the SWH Eye Center in the late 1970s and after Dr, Swagel passed away (while I was out of the state) and upon my return from a 15 yr absence  began seeing Dr. Hiatt for the past 10 years.  During that time my cataracts "ripened" and he removed them a year and a half ago.  Many local MDs use Dr. Hiatt, a good sign I might say.  He is very knowledgeable and does literally 100's of cataract surgeries every couple of weeks!!!  The facility is 21st century, clean and comfortable, with a friendly and efficient staff.  The actual surgery, completely painless and done while awake take 5 minutes!  One eye at a time, a week or so apart.  I'm happy to say my vision is close to perfect at a distance but I do need those inexpensive pharmacy eyeglasses for reading.  This was all carefully explained to me prior to the surgery.  Hiatt is the only eye surgeon who will get a scalpel near my eyes :)

Ate here on Father's Day plus 1, a hot Monday evening!  My son invited me out to celebrate his Dad, a loving gesture.  At 5:15 PM the place was very quiet, but then to be expected on a Monday night after a holiday.  The restaurant had a somewhat rustic appeal to the inner fisherman.  It had a clean look and no fishy odors detected.  The booth was large and comfortable.  Our server was pleasant and efficient.  My son ordered "Jumbo Shrimp Ballerine", (Tomatoes, garlic, basil and white wine) with tail-on shrimp, looked like about 8, with pasta in a mild red sauce with chunks of stewed tomatoes .... (18.95).  Not a lot of flavor but the medium shrimp were fresh tasting.  For starters I had a cup of King's Spicy Seafood Chowder .... (5.25) (but a dollar off with an entree).  Fabulous chowder, loaded with fish and potatoes, very spicy but super delicious.  This alone would  get me to return!  Next came Wild Costa Rican Mahi Mahi.... (21.95) which I ordered blackened, accompanied by Grilled Zucchini and Sauteed Fresh Spinach.  The veggies were vibrantly colored and super fresh tasting.  I had to send back the spinach because it was cold which our waiter did rapidly and graciously.  The fish was perfectly cooked, reminded me of New Orleans.  No room for desert unfortunately.  This is a very nice place for tasty fresh and properly cooked seafood, in a pleasant atmosphere.  I shall return.

Small friendly place dominated by a central bar containing a conveyor belt rotating around the bar transporting small dishes of various sushi products, clever and interesting and entertaining!  Table /menu service was also available.  The fish was fresh and tasty, the spicy squid salad outstanding as was the (6 large) shrimp tempura.  We ordered 4 rolls, the tempura and aforementioned salad and spicy fried calamari and 2 hot green teas (we each had our own teapot, good tea and plenty of it.  Our bill was a little over $50 plus tax and tip.  A little too much food for us but we managed to stuff it down.  Of course we will return :)

Quantity is one of their specialties followed by quality!  You get a big bang for your buck and splitting or sharing plates makes sense.  The staff is friendly and quite efficient.  The diner is nicely decorated rustic and is clean, including the restrooms!  We went for a late Sunday breakfast, it was packed but they told me if I found an open seat at the counter, "grab it".  The estimated 30 - 40 minute wait became 10 when a couple left the counter and I "grabbed" it :)   We ordered Corned beef hash (9.49) with griddle-fried potatoes (hashed browns), 2 eggs and a large pancake (instead of the biscuit or toast option).  It was not canned corned beef, delicious and a lot of it.  I had the Double Bacon B.L.A.S.T., (9.49) which contained 4 thick slices of bacon, lettuce, avocado, swiss cheese, tomato & mayo on the biggest triple- decker sandwich cut in quarters and filling a large platter with enough french fries to feed 2 or 3 people.  I should have split it with my wife. A huge 4 star feast for 4 and we 2 fools ate almost all of it!!  The coffee and tea were of high quality. I want to come back for their Friday night 4P-8P all you can eat fish fry for a dollar less than I paid for my breakfast dishes.

As I promised in my first review, I went back on a Friday evening for the All You Can Eat Fish Fry.  The fish (cod) was deep fried in a crispy and very tasty batter, served in 3 large pieces, with good cole slaw and crispy french fries, accompanied by a home made tartar sauce.  I think I paid 8.99 and ordered another round of fish, brought me 2 large pieces with additional tartar sauce and some extra slaw and after that I quit, so full of delicious fish!  I plan to do it again soon.

We frequent this very attractive restaurant a lot because it never disappoints!  Today is National Lasagna Day and Brio served their beautiful rendition of the tri-color Italian flag Lasagna for half price, about nine fifty!!!  Beautiful and tasteful, an amazing dish.  Staff is always very attentive, friendly and efficient.  They serve a wonderful warm crusty sourdough bread and multi-seeded triangular flatbread crackers with real butter. They have a large varied delicious menu, it's hard to go wrong!  Give them a try and you will come back over and over as I do :)

Well I guess I'm a pretty patriotic kind of guy!  My last review of this great restaurant was National Lasagna Day last July and this time National Ravioli Day which might mean that I just love a bargain at half price.  We ordered the two half price ravioli dishes on the menu, Portobello Ravioli with Cremini mushrooms, tomatoes, Parmigiano-Reggiano and fresh thyme in a light champagne brown butter sauce, $8, the better of the two, and Lobster & Shrimp Ravioli $10, prettier than the first but not as great tasting.  Service was impeccable as usual, cleanliness too!  An attractive environment and usually very busy, people know good food. I guess I need to get back here more often and not wait for half price meals :)

Been buying my fresh Artisan bread here for many years!  I don't think they have a "bad" tasting bread and when it is a bit chewy inside and crunchy outside, I'm happy.  I usually buy a large loaf of Ciabatta and have it sliced for my sandwiches, heavenly.  Just the right texture, lots of little holes, freezes well.  Can you believe this diversity of available breads?  BREADS SERVED DAILY: Caraway Rye- Ciabatta-French Baguette-Friday Challah-HerbHoney-Wheatberry-Levain-Nine Grain-Pasilla -Chili Rye-Pretzel-Rosemary- sea Salt-Rustic baguette-Sesame Paysanne Baguette-SourdoughVienna-Whole Wheat -Cinnamon Raisin and Nut, ALL amazing!! Their soup and sandwiches are great too, but I do a 99% just bread takeout once a week.  My wife loves the scones and cinnamon rolls and all their pastries. Try anything that sounds good to you, it will be :)

A little piece of Italy hidden in Gilbert, AZ! Thank you YELP for helping us find this delight of a restaurant.  People say things like "best food I ever ate" and I never thought I would be using such a trite expression.  But here it is, dish after dish served with greatness, flavorful, clean and fresh, made by a kitchen master!  Were the portions small? NONE were!  Was the food presented attractively?  YES, like a master's painting!  Was the food cooked properly?  Fresh where it needed to be, tender, never overcooked! We started our meal in this attractive two dozen table restaurant with Mom out front and Pop cooking in the back, with Calamari Fritti, abundant, fabulous taste, crunchy and tender, accompanied with a Marinara Sauce that would be great on any pasta!  Next a Caesar Salad, followed by Chicken Amalfitano (Chicken breast topped with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, red wine, demi glace, fresh mushrooms and fresh herbs) with a side of steamed broccoli with a hint of garlic.  Salmone Livornese,  covered with red onions, capers, and olives with plum tomatoes, and accompanied by the same wonderful broccoli.  A very large and thick chunk of ocean fresh, perfectly cooked, moist, nary a bone, fat or piece of skin present salmon.  We hummed as we ate if you know what I mean.  At the end I was brought a lovely slice of chocolate cake with a lit birthday candle in it and a few staff members sang Happy Birthday to me.   I want to mention that I lived in Italy for ten years and La Calabria Ristorante took me back to the best of the best!!!  As my wife proclaimed, "this is my new favorite restaurant."  Don't miss out just because it's hidden behind a Discount Tire shop in Gilbert.

The Eagle truly soars!  Amazing quality, service and variety blew us away.  I loved it that the odor of tobacco was practically nil!  We love sushi and they delivered, with extremely fresh and properly served seafood.  Tuesday nights are sushi nights at the Eagle and they did not disappoint.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers I stopped in the office and registered for their "Players Card".  All that was needed was my drivers license.  Showing this card to the buffet cashier got me a $4.20 discount for that little effort.  The sushi buffet dinner is $15.50 per person and well worth it. There were nigri with salmon, tuna, and 2 other fish, as well as octopus, 4 kinds of delectable sushi rolls, fresh fresh and perfectly cooked and seasoned enormous salmon fillet that was delectable!  I ate the most amazing fried cod, moist inside, crispy outside and hot right out of the deep fryer.  The pickled ginger slices were the best I've tasted in years.  Once we had consumed our delectables from the sea, we headed inland so to speak. I sampled their fried pork belly in bbq sauce - heavenly!  (I'm ashamed to admit it was the highlight of the entire evening for me!) Then a carved slice of roast pork loin which I smothered in brown gravy accompanied by whipped potatoes and freshly cooked green beans.  I skipped the cod vera-cruz and the lovely assortment of Mexican dishes and condiments, the succulent carved roast beef .  There were a myriad of more beautiful dishes calling out to me, with no more parking space in my stomach, sorry, I couldn't slip another new taste into the mix.  Two large dessert tables called out as well, loaded with brightly colored pasteries, pies, puddings, the makings of a soft freeze sunday.  I had to try some of them and discovered they were 3's and 4's rather than that food already consumed 5's!!!  Nothing could detract or subtract from the 5 star rating I awarded the Eagle.  There is NO WAY I will not return, and hopefully soon.

Hard to find, glad I did!!! Friendly, knowledgeable, fair, honest, respectful, helpful, efficient, trust-worthy, all words that describe Family Auto Care.  They have worked on both of my vehicles, a 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan and a 2002 Mitsu Eclipse Spyder GT with great skill and fair prices.

It took about 25 minutes to fill out the "new"  patient forms, very comprehensive, good stuff!  The front desk was efficient and helpful.  Waited an additional (post form fill out) 10 minutes to be called back.  The doctors assistant was somewhat brisk but friendly.  Waited an additional 4 or 5 minutes until Dr. Darson came in.  Nice bedside manner, came across as interested and listened well.  He never appeared to be in a hurry and spent about 3/4 hour with me.  I found him to be empathetic, friendly and interested in what I had to say.   he set up two follow up appointments and will do some testing followed by a CT scan with contrast and another appointment.  I got the feeling he knew what he was doing and I felt more optimistic.  Good Doc!!!

A lengthy drive from my home in Chandler but worth it!  In large shopping center, easy parking.  Staff is friendly and efficient with good service.  Sports bar atmosphere with several large flat screens, a well stocked bar and adjacent dining room. Tables and seating was clean and comfortable.  We ordered a large shrimp and octopus cocktail, a 5 star dish, loaded with the seafood, crunchy cucumber, tomato juice, etc.,very tasty and filling, and only $13, and Bacanora, described as shrimp in mildly spiced cheese sauce, served with rice, potato slices and salad, a 3 star dish, ($14) with 6 medium shrimp despite the fact that the menu photo had twice as many shrimp, and no spiciness at all. We drank the House Margarita, $6 as it was happy hour (3-6pm).  Also had the house wine at $3.50 a glass.  We closed with Sopapillas with powdered sugar and honey, only average.  We will return to try their fish, looked and smelled pretty good.

Life in black and white would be very boring, but a man named Adam Maire decided he could spice that up and formed "Life In Color" Painting Services!  He was very prompt to return my request for a painting quote, was clean cut and very respectful and friendly.  I got 7 bids from different companies and his bid was so scary, having not just a lower price, but destroying all the others coming in at one fourth the price of 2 of the bidders!  I thought either he was poor at his estimates or the others just wanted to exploit me or weren't really interested in working.  Well Adam was "the man".  He did what he said he would and did it well and appeared to have fun doing a GREAT JOB!  WOW, customer service, skill in painting, honest and truly wants to please his customer and didn't even take a break for lunch so as to complete his job in one day.  I was shocked to see just one review for him on Yelp, but if you go to the Kudzu review site, the man has 59 out of 59 five star reviews.  I am impressed with his reputation and with the quality of his work.  I guess I sound like a big fan, but I am because he earned it.

So many bad pizza places, but now and then you find a good one!  When I try a new pizza place I always order the same pizza so I get great comparisons.  I get a thin medium pizza with TOMB (my name for it, spooky eh?) Tomato, onions, mushrooms and bacon.  Their's was great, the pizza sauce was slightly spicy and I ordered extra sauce and cooked well done.  Slices of roma tomatoes, red onions and small brown mushroom caps.  The bacon was crumbled in very small pieces and not very abundant unfortunately, losing them a star. The crust was both crunchy and chewy, very pleasant.  All in all, a good find and I will be back.

Right on Indian School Rd. a block east of Scottsdale Rd. in Scottsdale, sits Tommy V's,  an attractive building filled with attentive friendly staff and ownership.  We had reservations for four at 6PM on a Saturday and the place was about half full.  Within an hour it was full!  That's when I noticed the noise level was rather high with laughter and conversations.  This was an attractive and fun environment.   It was my wife's birthday and several waiters and the owner congratulated her more than several times, a nice touch.  My wife ordered decaf herbal tea and 4 different kinds were brought to the table.  Much has been said about their wine list but none of us ordered any alcoholic drinks.  It was an upscale environment with white linen tablecloths and attractive silverware.   We started with appetizers, the fried calamari (not the most tender, but flavorful and a good sized portion) and crab cakes (extremely flavorful and attractive to the eye). We had Shrimp Risotto  (creamy and delicious with lots of shrimp on top),  Manila Clams Linguine Roasted Garlic, White Wine, Fresh Herb Sauce  (a good amount of clams, a few still in the shell, tasty but not wonderful, with well cooked pasta),  Chicken Piccata  (a bit overcooked, lots of capers in a tart sauce, pleasant tasting but not great, small piece of breast cutlet, with a side of penne rigate in a tomato sauce that was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor), and Seared Pacific Red Snapper, Creamy Polenta & Asparagus with Mushrooms, Red Pepper in Tomato Sauce  ( an excellent dish, pretty, tasty, good sized portion of well cooked snapper), one of our better dishes.  Next time I wouldn't order the calamari, chicken piccata, and the clam linguine.  They brought my wife a slice of what looked and tasted like French Silk Pie with a little candle in it (no charge), a nice touch.  It was delicious! We will give them another try, I would rate them between 3 1/2 and 4 stars.

First let me tell you my theory about NY bagels.  I left NYC in 1958 so my recall is of that era.  The last true bagel bakers were unable to interest their grandchildren to become bakers and the "art" slowly morphed from the '40s - '50s style to the 21st century, baked by non-Jewish bakers of other origins. Yes they still boiled and then baked but were different.  Not not good or great but a new style for a new people.  We love things based on good memories and the current younger population likes their newer style of bagel, hence the great reviews that I can't agree with as I am (a long retired New Yorker longing for the bagels of yore:)  To me a bagel always has a distinct hole in it's center, a shiny, tough, and lightly crunchy rich brown crust and a chewy dense interior.  I thought that Bruegger's Bagels came close.  They are gone from our area but still in Tucson. Bagelman's bagels taste good, they are however not what I expected and hence not a NY bagel to ME! Their Bialy however is too dense, as their bagel is not dense enough.   To all the young folk out there (born less than 50 years ago), you will love Bagelman's baking!!! Mr. Bagelman, keep it up, you are indeed pleasing those you need to please!

Yes, this is the place to be transported to Szechwan province in China!  Thank goodness for the menu covered in photos as we could not read all the hand written little banners with their dishes hanging on all the walls.  There were 4 tables for 2, 6 tables for 4, and 3 very large round tables.  I noticed my wife and I plus one older gentleman were the only non orientals in the restaurant, and for Sunday noon most of the tables were filled.  All the staff was smiling, friendly and helpful, with the majority speaking very little English, as I initially said "transported"! We actually had 2 non spicy dishes out of 3: Steamed Juicy Pork Dumplings.  8 splendid round pockets of dough filled with meat and soup, 6.98;  Honey Walnut Shrimp, with 11 or 12 succulent jumbo shrimp and lots of half walnuts, 11.98; Salt and Pepper Calamari, a huge portion of fried Calamari with dried hot red peppers and slices of very hot green peppers mixed in.  Crunchy salted pieces of tender squid perfectly cooked with delicious heat!  This was a lot of memorable excellent food and we just had no room for anything else :)  Service +++++, environment +++++, staff +++++, value +++++, and taste +++++! Can't wait to return and try other menu items, soon me thinks.

I ordered take out through the drive through window and needed to park just past it to wait for my order.  They gave me a plastic number to put on my window sill.  I ordered 3 pork tenderloin sandwiches and oh my, were they large!  The bun had to be almost 5 inches round and the tenderloin, fried crispy, stuck out about an inch all the way around.  I had planned to eat two of them but saved one as I was stuffed.  Also had a strawberry shake which was delicious too.  Great value and service, the meat was very tender with a crisp tasty breading and lots of add ons - red onions, lettuce, mayo, mustard, and pickle.  I have had their fries in the past and they were good too.  I will come back as I can't get a fried pork tenderloin sandwich anywhere else that I know of, it's worth the return!

What is there to say about pizza, everyone has their own idea of what's good.  It is unusual to see 4+ ratings for any pizza place and 5 stars is quite rare.  Well our local Big Boy deserves all the praise he can garnish.  The thin crust is both tasty and pretty to look at.  The topping seem fresh and well cooked as for example the crispy bacon pieces.  I would have liked the mushrooms pieces and the onion pieces a bit larger, but the flavor comes through.  I ordered a 16 inch pizza I have named "the tomb", a great trick or treat name!  Topped with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and bacon, it is the pizza I compare with each restaurant I try.  My complaint is paying $2 a topping.  Here is a website for their menu (http://red-fork.com/BigBoysPizzaAz).  Staff is more than pleasant, constantly up beat and smiling and trying to be helpful.  What a great mom and pop operation.  I will return and try all of their items over time.  You won't be disappointed eating here.  A true local gem.

I just lost my review as I was about to enter it.  This just adds to my angst.  I called and ordered my beloved "TOMB" pizza, it was 25 minutes as they had predicted.  The crust was not as good as before, more bread like, perhaps under cooked a bit.  The sauce was scant, the toppings not as tasty as I remembered, less cheese, but still looked pretty but tasted dry.  Staff as pleasant as always, still upbeat and friendly.  In my review a year and a half ago I said "You won't be disappointed eating here", well I was tonight.  I will wait awhile and give them another chance.

I had a problem with the back of the passenger seat and my mechanic suggested that I find an auto upholstery shop to get it fixed.  I called Sonny's and they were very pleasant and helpful on the phone.  Went in today, 2/17, and they checked it out and found a way to adjust the seat  back without making a repair and saved me the money for a repair!!!  Nice people to do business with, they could have taken advantage of me but didn't.  They now have a future customer for life :)

As I previously said in my first review I went back to have some sheepskin seat covers installed for our hot summer.  Sonny is pleasant, personable and an expert upholsterer.  I watched him work on my seats, assisted by his son, and they did a beautiful job at a fair price!

My wife and I decided to try Rudy's BBQ on May day.  I worried about long lines but that didn't happen at 5pm on a Tuesday.  I figured they had a month to get their staff working efficiently.  We were greeted at the door and given small printed menus as they explained that the meats were sold by the half pound, there were cold sides in a large refrigerator case, drinks on a huge ice filled table and an order counter.  They place your order in a wax paper lined plastic basket, approximately 12" by 18" with 5" sides. We took a medium sized (pint) potato salad (3.69) and a small pudding (2.49) from the refrigerator case, and 2 bottles of IFC root beer (3.38) off the iced table and proceeded to the counter with the digital scale.  Ordered pulled pork and was charged for 0.58 lb of it at 5.79, don't know why they can't measure it out to the half pound listed at 4.99 they advertise. Also ordered beef brisket, the moist which is a bit more fatty but I heard the extra lean was too dry. They put over 3/4 of a pound on the scale and the girl asked if I wanted some taken off, which she did leaving 0.69 lb (8.96) The meats were great, moist, delicious, well smoked, some of the best BBQ we've had. Also ordered some hot sides, new potatoes small 1.99 (boiled or steamed peeled potatoes, chunked and floating in butter.  Nothing special, little flavor, needed lots of salt and pepper, won't order it again.  Sweet cream corn small 2.19 was overly sweet, needed lots of salt to counteract the sugar, won't order again.  The potato salad was fairly good, I'd order that again as it goes well with the meats.  My wife said the pudding (banana) was "kinda bland and I wouldn't order it again".  Total with tax was $31.00 A bit overpriced I think,  They threw in 8 slices of white and wheat bread to make sandwiches with, the bread was very fresh.  There were 2 kinds of BBQ sauce on the table, tomato/vinegar based, on mild, one slightly spicy, they were OK, not great. You could buy a 32 0z bottle for 8.50 if you desired.  Other than the quality and taste of the meats, nothing else stood out.  There are long wooden tables that could become uncomfortably crowded if they are very busy.  I think I might return to buy their meat and take it home, the brisket at 12.98 a lb and the pulled pork at 9.98 a lb.  I give them 4 stars because of how good the meats are. There were pickles, peppers and sweet onion slices available for the taking.

Haven't tried their burgers and other sandwiches YET but intend to if they are anywhere as good as the soft freeze they serve.  Multiple flavors including a special one every day.  Decent prices, good size portions, fair prices, clean place, friendly staff. interesting looking fish sandwiches.  Soft Freeze the way it was intended to be, mmm!

Little has changed I'm sorry to say!  They gave us a $5 discount for her birthday. We ordered the same meal for my wife (chicken fried chicken special breakfast and I had their new sandwich, beef brisket dip with fries and a pickle.  The meat had little flavor other than a smoky one and the au jus had very little taste.  Wife's hash brown had a nice flavor but needed to be browned more, my fries were meh. Noticed that her chicken fried chicken was $1.60 more since our last visit 2 1/2 years ago, had a nice taste, still small.  A 2 1/2 star meal, please remind me if I ever think about returning :(

I noticed that the Polish sausage is grilled and the Vienna dog is steamed or boiled resulting in no snap with the bite.  Toppings were great, sauted onions on the Polish (wow, great flavor due to carmelization) and good chili and melted cheeze on the dog.  Noon on a Monday, place packed but a few tables were available.  Staff gave us a menu and brief lecture about the place and the various foods, nice first time touch.  Prices were reasonable and the portions large.  The place was quite large but clean and friendly.  I will be back to try their halibut and fresh tuna sandwiches!!

Brian is the MAN when it comes to any video set up needs or problems!  Over the past 3 years or so I have enjoyed his services from installing a new flat screen TV (he did some impressive sweating in my attic) and adding surround sound, to programming my remote control so it takes care of all functions, how great!  He was always responsive over the phone to help resolve minor problems.  Friendly, very knowledgeable, polite, well groomed and considerate of my home, worked fast and was always dependable, keeping me informed of his progress and kept his appointments.  He guarantees his work, which has always been excellent.  His prices have always been more than fair. I won't let anyone else touch my AV equipment!  He might be busy but is worth waiting for.

Fast, Fresh, Tasty, Abundant portions, Clean and Friendly, excellent value!  Where else could I have gotten change from a $10 bill and eaten 6 fish tacos and 2 fountain drinks?  The fish was very tasty and their salsa bar over flowed with home made goodness.  Help yourself to chopped cabbage, cole slaw, assorted peppers, pico di gallo, ranch dressing, avocado dressing, chipotle mayo, tartar sauce, and many bottles of hot sauce.  A great addition to the neighborhood Elliot/Priest.

Dropped in for lunch on a Sunday at noon.  Large restaurant with several rooms and a friendly efficient staff.  The restaurant is clean and brightly decorated and the restroom was more than adequate.  The wife ordered Torta norteña de res (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-tempe#b5_syEe_0dULbFvnbUdd1w) and I had the Torta USA, very tasty and interesting mixed ingredient sandwiches, with different meats, cheese, grilled fresh pineapple, etc etc. Really packed full of fresh tastiness.  For dessert we had the flan which was just OK, a bit too dense but flavorful. If you want a Mexico City taste, this is the place.

This is a cute little oriental restaurant in a small strip mall.  Attractive colors and decorations and a specials of the day white board written in Chinese.  The friendly waitress (the only waitress)  translated it for us after we had ordered, they sounded good.  The place was well kept, clean, I would say spotless but it is just a few months old.  It was close to 6pm on a Wednesday and 2 other tables were occupied by orientals.  Thank goodness it was relatively quiet because service is rather slow.  This was truly a mom and pop operation, with pop doing all of the cooking.  We ordered an appetizer, House Pepper Calamari.  It was listed as spicy but had very little heat to it.  The squid was well cooked, crunchy batter, tender and tasty interior, but it was extremely salty.  Next we had a small Spicy Orange Chicken, again almost no heat to it, but tender breast meat enrobed in a light and crispy batter covered with a nice sauce.  A good sized portion.  It would have been very good if it were spicy.  I guess great for Americanized palettes.  Also ordered was Crispy Walnut Shrimp, with plump well cooked shrimp in a tasty mayo based sauce with candied walnuts.  This was a 5 star dish!  I have taken away a star for the long wait to get our food after it was ordered, the lack of spice in their spicy dishes,  and the over salting of the squid.  We will come back and give them another try.

I'm glad we returned to eat at Max Asia!  They continue to be pleasant, helpful and friendly people.  We tried a couple of dishes we knew little about. First we had "King of the Dragon", wonderful tender and moist breaded fish fillets, I believe Swai, in an Asian wine and garlic sauce that I requested be spicy.  The sauce was so good, with a nice kick, that I put it on our 2nd dish as well.  Satay Kway Teow, shrimp, chicken, bean sprouts, onions, egg, flat rice noodles, in curry sauce.  I'm not crazy about the curry flavor in general so the other sauce helped a lot!  If you love curry, this is a fab dish!  All of the ingredients tasted fresh, well cooked and seasoned.  Even though I didn't care for the curry flavor (my mistake not looking at the menu description) I feel they deserve a 5 star rating.  We will return many times, it's that GOOD.

Had lunch here today.  Opposed to what others had said, the place was clean and neat.  The spring rolls were large and delicious.  I had a bbq pork banh mi (sandwich on wonderful crusty roll) and beef pho and my son had their pho No. 1.  He frequently eats Vietnamese food and thought it was one of the best he has tasted. We split the sandwich and dipped it in the pho so I guess you could call it a Vietnamese Dip!  Service was fine and attentive.  The prices were more than reasonable and we plan to return.

I can't believe I missed this place for 2 years, it's quality quality quality and value value value!  Small place, pleasantly decorated, clean and service with a smile.  Small menu but big on flavor and quality, a family success story.  Since "Spring Roll" is in their featured item, I ordered 2 orders of the "factory roll", 6 hand made (right in front of me) delectable delicious  and pretty with fresh crunchy veggies and shrimp and roast pork.  Got an order of fried egg rolls (3) and an order of fried dumplings (3) which were hot crispy and delicious.  We also ordered 2 sandwiches, one chicken, the other roast pork.  They were on flaky sub rolls that were an excellent vehicle for all the goodness packed inside.  Happy and stuffed we left with 2 take out orders of the factory rolls for that midnight snack!  Look for them between Walmart and Bosa Donut, a little bit of Vietnamese heaven at very reasonable prices.

Large restaurant, previously the space was occupied by a couple of cafes.  It is rather stark looking and can be loud with all the hard surfaces surrounding this big open space.  The waitress was very good, friendly, well informed about her product. Ordered a pound bag of shrimp (sweet and firm, very tasty)  that had added to it a piece of corn on the cob (about a third of the cob, grossly overcooked, was mushy), a small red potato, 4 pieces of sausage in their trifecta sauce spice level 2.  Also had a basket of fried calamari sticks (excellent), Cajun french fries (crispy and mildly spiced, good), a basket of fried clams (very good), a basket of fried oysters (very good), hush puppies (good).  My big mistake was to order the self peel shrimp, it took me a half hour to peel those little critters because they were hot and the shell didn't want to peel and I was spattered with sauce, my bad.  Next time I will eat a poor  boy sandwich or any of the other fried dishes.  The restroom was clean but had no paper toweling, just powerful air blowers and I needed to use some toilet paper to dry around my mouth and wipe my nose, not a big deal.   I would give between 3 1/2 and 4 stars.

Busy place, appears clean, staff friendly.  Asked for salt and was told I wouldn't need it and they had none, no pepper either.  I needed both it turns out.  Ordered 2 sandwiches and a side of fried onion rings.  The rings were too with breading and desperately needed salt but the ketchup had to do.  Had their Hollywoods SF Cheesesteak #2, the mushrooms were cold and tasteless, had tons of shredded lettuce, some tomato, lots of a mayo tasting sauce and I wasn't crazy about the dutch crunch bread, crunchy yes, flavor little and dry.  My wife said she liked the bread on her Bear Hug #444 (Bacon, extra dirty sauce, Mushrooms, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Thinly Sliced Rib Eye Steak). She thought they deserved 3 stars and I thought 2 stars so I guess it will be 2 1/2 stars total.  I also thought it was too bad that they had no tea and their root beer was overly sweet.

How sad, I expected a bit more in flavor and goodness.  Had their California double burger combo.  The fries were abundant but cut so thin (shoestring) you couldn't taste the potato and had to really work at stuffing your face to get enough with each bite of burger.  My wife ordered a combo (single) and some chili cheese fries.  They came in a huge mound covered in lots of cheese and chili.  The chili was meaty but bland and the cheese had little flavor.  The burgers couldn't be tasted under all the toppings and ketchup. I would rate their burger about average for fast food places.  Now the soft freeze was tasty, I should have tried the cod fish instead of the beef.  The pink lemonade was good. Overall, not a lot of value here.

We came at 5:30 on a Tuesday evening and we were the only customers at the time.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, but spoke very little English.  The restaurant is rather small but nicely decorated.  It is north of a Walgreens pharmacy and just south of the McDonalds and directly across the street from a Subway and a Tattoo shop on Alma School Rd.    We ordered off of both the regular and the Chinese menu.  Started with fried Potstickers, juicy, large and flavorful. Next came Pork Egg Fu Yong which had a nice flavor and lots of pork piled on top but some how was very difficult to cut, and Twice Cooked Pork which had a lot of tender very thin slices of pork, onions, red  hot little peppers, some ginger and other chinese veggies.  Although I asked for it to be spicy it had little heat to it.  The fortune cookies were quite fresh, sweet and crispy. I have taken away a star from the food.  The very friendly owner/chef came out to see how we liked the food and with his very broken English promised he would make some wonderful dishes for us next time!  We will probably return to try some other menu items .

What a disappointment after reading glowing reviews!  A cute place with 11 tables inside and a lovely little outdoor patio.  It appeared clean and brightly decorated and the wait staff were efficient and friendly, clean cut and professional.  We came to lunch to meet an old friend who lives in Casa Grande.  I ordered the carne assado chimi ($12) which came with rice and beans.  I had to send the rice and beans back to be re heated as they were tepid.  Swiftly returned steamy hot, but had little flavor as did my chimi.  Lots of little chunks of beef, somewhat tough and with little flavor.  The added green sauce was skimpy and not in the least spicy.   The chips on the table were mixed, some old, some new, some crunchy, some tough.  My wife had  steak fajitas ($13) that came with guacamole, peppers, onions and a side of rice and beans.  The strips of good beef were large and plentiful, tender and good beef tasting but no spices detected to let you know it was a Mexican dish.  Our friend had the daily special tacos ($5) which she said were good.  Only one desert was available, a raspberry brownie which we passed on.  This was not Mexican cuisine.  .

My experience after the first 3 months with Justin is very positive.  He has been punctual, responds quickly to requests and does careful work.  His rates are reasonable.  He leaves our place in a clean and neat condition and carts away all his clippings, etc. Usually he comes with one or two workers and they are efficient careful workers.  I'm happy with their service!

It has been over two years of continuous service and Justin still impresses me!  He has been coming every week except for a 3 month break in the winter, as I do not have rye grass.  He has replaced 2 different sprinkler heads his mower broke in these 2 years without a charge.  He takes responsibility for his work, works quickly and is always friendly and efficient and goes "the extra mile"!  I am shocked by the two one-star reviews, they don't appear to be anything like my experience.  I would recommend him without reservation :)

What a pleasant surprise to find a practically neighborhood "sushi joint" just up the road from us!  It used to be that there was no really fresh fish in Arizona but there is now.  A lovely, cute little restaurant, bright, clean and inviting, that's Yanagi.  Available are 8 bar-stools to watch the action, plus 2 tables for 2 and 9 tables for 4, that's it.  The wait staff consisted of 2 young ladies and a college age looking gentleman, who were friendly and efficient and very personable.  It was a Friday early evening about 5pm and we were still within their Happy Hour!! Monday thru Friday 2pm - 6pm.  We both ordered iced green tea, wonderfully refreshing.  For starters I had Miso Soup, rich in flavor and depth and my wife had the house salad with an interesting ginger dressing.  Both these choices were on the small side but great in flavor.  Next, Salmon Kama, the tastiest and meatiest broiled salmon collar we have ever had!  A platter with 2 pieces of salmon nigiri, placed between a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy salmon roll.  Another plate, boat shaped, of 6 pork gyoza with sauce, crunchy outside, soft and delicious inside.  What a feast, everything tasted fresh and delicious. For desert we ordered 2 desserts, Deep fried Ice Cream, a large portion of sweet vanilla ice cream enrobed in a sweet crispy batter, topped with whipped cream and a cherry, and a large Mango Mochi, quartered and also topped like the ice cream.  With tax this feast was just under $28, you gotta be kidding! What more can I say, go early, enjoy, and return often, I surely will.

I looked forward to trying the new Mod Pizza near my home.  Went Friday evening about 5:30PM.  It was relatively quiet with just a hand-full of diners, lots of empty tables to choose from.  I noted a some what spartan environment, a lot of wood and metal and a high ceiling and large windows with a long counter with 4 or 5 servers standing behind many stainless trays containing dozens and dozens of toppings to choose from (all for one price). Everything was clean and the staff extra friendly.  A beverage machine served the usual sodas and iced tea for 1.97  The pizza was extra thin (11 inch), creating an "eating problem".  It was difficult to pick up having no self support and with the available flimsy plastic knives and forks it was very difficult to cut and get on your fork.  They would put on as many toppings as you request and as much as you would like.  All appeared to be fresh and of good quality but some how had little flavor.  I thought it was because the red sauce was too thin.  We ordered a second pizza, with more sauce and more cheese but it didn't help.  I really wanted it to be good but it failed IMO.  We won't return, too bad, it's a nice concept.

Tev Castro (THC) is quite friendly, hard working, efficient and DEPENDABLE!  He cleans up after himself and appears to know his stuff, a good electrician.  He keeps his appointments and works quickly, a very personable man.  I will use his services again in the future and recommend him to my friends and family.
