After living in England, I grew accustomed to really good Indian food. I've been searching for a proper curry in the Phoenix area for the last few years. This is the first place that's hit the spot.   We came in for dinner and ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chicken korma. The chicken tikka masala had a bit more of a tomato base than I am used to but it was delicious. The korma had a little kick to it but I wouldn't really register it as spice. Overall, the flavor of everything was amazing. We also had a garlic naan and papadums. Everything tasted wonderful and the service was good. We will definitely be bringing all of our family and friends here.

Flavors are good but they are very icy rather than creamy. Not a huge selection of toppings compared to other yogurt shops in the area. The colors and signage are dark/bright colors that do compliment each other at all. Overall, not an experience that leaves you wanting more.   I think the shop could be great if they got a better product and redecorated.

I was happy to have a Chipotle location so close to home but I will not be returning. I have given this location at least four chances over the last six  months hoping that there would be some improvement. Every time I've been the brown rice is hard as though it hasn't been cooked properly. On at least two occasions they have run out of the meat I was ordering. This last time there was at least a 7 min wait for fajita veggies. I wouldn't mind those things if they were really busy but it's never been busy when I've been in. And the portion sizes are always minuscule. From now on I will drive out of my way to avoid another disappointing meal or just choose something else all together. Not worth your money.
