I waited for an awesome meal at a place I visited over a decade ago.  I remember the prime rib, crab and seafood from before but I was disappointed in the selection this time. It had more Chinese, Mexican and fruits than I remember.  I saw no real potatoe dishes other than mashed.  Sushi wasn't good.  However the prime rib as great, crab was abundant and calamari excellent.  Pre-made salads were not good.  My husband is a meat and potatoes and he barely found stuff to eat.  I would like to see a price that matches the lack of selection.  I would like to see more sushi that tastes good and more hot crab than cold crab.

I love the small, friendly atmosphere.  Amber was great from the start and made the experience the best!  We will be back as often as we can.  The Bison burger is fabulous and worth every bite of it.  So sorry we didnt walk in after a movie before now.

Only a few times have I had this quality of gyro, fresh rice and buttery soft pita.  I'm impressed and will recommend this place for its quality food.  Love their fries with the coating and crispness.  I don't always understand having fries as an option but I will get them next time.  The rice is soft, flavorful and moist.  Cannot say enough about the fresh, soft and tasty pita bread.  Well done!
