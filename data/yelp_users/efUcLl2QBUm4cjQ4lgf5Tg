I love that this place has a variety of vegan options. The calzone with soy cheese and soy sausage is delicious! The vegan pizza delight is also tasty. The owner and staff are great too. My only complaint is how much more the vegan calzone is compared to the regular ones.

We have been to this hospital about 4-5 times in the past year with a couple different cats of ours. We have been very happy with Dr Clark in the past.  He usually goes over everything really well and doesn't try to talk you into unnecessary care. However  I just got back from an appointment today and am very disturbed by the experience.    First of all a little background. My boyfriend and I have been TNRing (Trap, Neuter, Return) for about 4 years. This program is very helpful for the feral cat population and only a select group of vets and clinics will even spay/neuter feral cats.  We have been using Altered Tails and although they do have their shortcomings for the most part they do a great job.   We trapped two cats on Wednesday night.  One of them turned out to be a friendly stray cat with an injury to his back leg.  Although I know AT doesn't treat  injuries we went ahead and took him in to be neutered along with the other feral cat we caught and made an appointment with Dr Clark to have him examined. Altered Tails called me after the surgery and explained that the cat had a reaction to anesthesia and he was freaking out and biting at his incision.  They put him back under, repaired the damage and put an e-collar on him. I was happy that they informed me of what happened and gave me instructions to keep a close eye on him.  I knew before I even walked into Dr. Clark's office that the incision wasn't looking great but did not blame Altered Tails because I knew what had happened.  But as soon as I got there Dr Clark seemed annoyed I took the him to Altered Tails and basically called them a chop shop.  Which is very offensive considering the work they do for animals.  And it made me feel like he thought I was a bad or cheap person for taking him there.  We have 6 indoor cats and care for 2 small feral colonies. We spend a lot of our time and money caring for not only our own cats but for many lost, abandoned and feral cats each year. We spend at least 5K+ annually caring for animals so I wouldn't think anyone would consider that cheap or unkind.  But that's exactly how I was made to feel.    Dr. Clark didn't even bother giving him a full exam (although I was charged for one) he took about 10 seconds and looked at his neuter incision and injured leg. He gave me an antibiotic and seemed to want to get me out of his office as quickly as possible.  I asked if he could help me put his e-collar back on because he had gotten it off in the carrier.  His reply "it's pretty straight forward" and sent me on my way.    I'm so disappointed that I thought we had finally found a great vet and he turned out to be this way.  We will now be on the search for a new vet. I hope no one else has to experience this type of treatment when they are only trying to go out of their way to help homeless animals.

I love everything about this place except the long drive from my house. If they opened a CenPho location I would be in heaven. However, it is always well worth the drive. So where do I start? I normally stick to one or two things on the menu at most restaurants, but this place has so many good ones I bounce around. First, salads - I'm currently obsessed with the Spicy Peanut "chicken" salad, but also love the Green salad..simple light and tasty.  Sandwiches - Spicy Po Boy....love it.  Bowls - Kung Pao is my favorite. I also like the spicy peanut bowl.  They are actually both very similar though so either is great. Pizza - the Western..delish! And probably the best part of Green....the Soynami. I've had several and all are amazing and better than any other soft serve option I was throwing down my gullet before I began Vegan. Sometimes they even have a wedding cake soynami.  If you ever see this on the menu get it! Oh and how could I forget the apps....hummus and "wings" are my favorite. This place is very reasonably priced too.  We can get an app, two meals, and a soynami for about $25 bucks.  The staff is always super nice and friendly. Service is always fast too. The atmosphere is pretty funky and cool although you might not see this from the outside. Just go inside - you'll be fine.  We've also been there for 4th of July and Thanksgiving and both were awesome. Everyone thinks vegans eat badly at Thanksgiving with no dead bird and all, but I couldn't imagine anyone not loving Green's Thanksgiving meals.   Go there and enjoy!

I'm not sure what's going on but it seems like they are adding more salt to most of their stuff and I can barely stand it anymore.  I love this place but honestly they need to ease up on the salt or I won't be able to eat there anymore.  I really wish they would update their menu too.

I was very hesitant to write this review because I really enjoyed coming to this salon. The staff is really friendly, good location, and reasonable prices, however after a couple not so great haircuts and then the one I got two weeks ago I feel I need to write it because had I paid closer attention to the reviews I would have gone with a different stylist. I've been to the salon about 5 times and have had my hair colored (which turned out pretty good) but the haircuts have been hit or miss - which usually varied between leaving feeling like my hair wasn't cut at all or was cut too much. I like to bring a picture so the stylist knows exactly what I'm looking for. I did this for my last cut which was taking my hair from mid-back to just below my shoulders. I've had my hair cut short MANY times so this was not a case of a shockingly short cut. The stylist put her own spin on it and decided to add lots of layers (although there were NO layers in the picture). When she first cut the length off I was actually quite happy, but by the time she was done adding layers (for some reason) it was HORRIBLE. I've pulled my hair back in a ponytail every day since. It's the worst haircut I've ever had. When I said something about the layers she didn't really seem to care much and said they were long layers. Again, never asked for or wanted layers. I'm guessing it will take about 6 months to get it to a place I can stand. I'm tempted to just cut it even shorter to get rid of the layers but that is not what I wanted to do and I need to find another salon to have this done. So, in a nutshell, salon seemed great but I wouldn't have Serena cut my hair again or return to the salon.

Jen has been our pet sitter for a year now and we couldn't be more thrilled to have found her. She is very professional and always takes notes on the care instructions. We have 7 indoor cats and 2 outdoor ferals so it's great that Jen doesn't charge by the animal! She is reliable and great with our cats. They are all from the streets and even though they have been socialized they're not really friendly with people they don't know. But they all seemed interested in Jen and let her pet them the first time she came over - they must have sensed she was an animal person. We used to swap pet sitting services with friends prior to finding Jen but it's great to know we have a professional that spends time with the cats and really cares for animals.
