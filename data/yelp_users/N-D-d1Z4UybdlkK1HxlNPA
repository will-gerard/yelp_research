Even though we have moved away from CenPho, my husband and I still use this Safeway Pharmacy. Quite frankly, they provide the very best pharmacy customer service I have ever experienced in my 14 years in the Valley. They know us by name. There have never been any hassles with insurance that they have not dealt with immediately. They communicate. They are fast and they are friendly. As a former Pharmacy Tech, I can tell you that their job can be downright awful sometimes, but we have never experienced anything but great service here.   I have used Osco, CVS,and Walgreens in the past and have dealt with lost prescriptions, crappy service, errors on my prescription labels, and other incompetencies . None of that has ever happened at this Safeway Pharmacy. The only thing Safeway Pharmacy has been lacking that the big chains have is the ability to link to all their stores, but Safeway will have that capability soon, I was recently told.   If you want both personal and professional service that is quick and error free, then transfer all  your prescriptions from the Walgreens across the street like I did.

My husband and I live downtown, and Sam's has become one of our favorite regular spots (bonus that the AMC theater is right there, too!). The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent.

Yesterday I saw the Actors Theatre production of "A Christmas Carol." For me, It's just not Christmas without at least one viewing of the Dickens classic, and this version was so good and so satisfying that I may actually forgo my beloved George C. Scott this year. Fezziwig teaches at the same school I do, and told me about the discounted tickets available. Even at the regular price ranging from $20 for children 16 and under to $47.50 for adult tickets, this production is worth every penny.  I was amazed by the quality of the special effects, impressed by the comedic timing, and found myself misty eyed at the end, having fully invested in the actors' performances. Even the kids were great, especially the little girl who played Fan (what a voice!) and the adorable kindergartner who played Tiny Tim (he is also "Half Day" in the Subway commercial). And in spite of the fact that I am one of those soulless people who despises most musicals, I found myself tapping my toes along with the songs.   I don't want to ruin the surprises by giving too many details, but I urge you to get your tickets today. This is a show not to be missed!

My conclusion after dining here for the first time is that hubby and I  have had all of these menu items before- and done better at other restaurants. The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that.

In my constant search for newer, faster, and more interesting routes on my commute to work from CenPho to Tempe, I've been passing by Rosita's a lot recently, and coerced my husband, who came home the other night and said, "Carolina's?" to try Rosita's instead. Boy, was I sorry.   Let's start with the mariachi musicians who stood so closely behind me that they completely invaded my "stranger bubble" and I was forced to move my seat at the table. Next, there were the chips which were just ok to begin with, and ended with gobs of congealed grease after they had cooled a tad. Then, hubby's machaca chimi was fine, with decent flavor, but my pork carnitas was so dry it was literally inedible. You could look at it and see that the sliced pork was so dry it was like the dessicated flesh at the Body Worlds exhibit. Gross, I know, but so was this meat. It simply should not have been served by a conscientious restaurant.   Next time, I won't contest it when Hubby suggests Carolina's (who serves the best chimis and by far the best tortillas in town).

Props to Alwun House for hosting events like the Exotic Art Show. Uptight religious types are nowhere to be found in this free spirited atmosphere, and that deserves a couple of stars alone. This is the third Exotic Art Show I have attended, and I have to be honest in saying 2008's was my least favorite. The cold may certainly have dampened the vibe (where were the portable heaters?), or maybe the acts were less to my personal liking. Miss Satanica, an eater of fire and glass, was great (and quite the trooper for continuing her show in spite of an injured ankle), but her weird lame sidekick did nothing for her. Of the Earth musicians had talent, but also oozed pretention and sounded like Rusted Root. Even the Ringmaster, Nick Tarr, was funnier last year. Some of the dancers were amazing, especially Fatima from Spell, and Jen from Of the Earth. I wished they had been on far longer.   The pieces in the art exhibit itself always vary wildly, from tame and classically beautiful, to the uber-graphic, violent, or decidedly non-vanilla fetish.  My personal favorites this year were Christian Correra (amazing frames as well as photography) and Sarah Clemens (whose gorgeous "Breezy" graced the cover of the program, and whom I luckily got to meet).   If you've never been, plan ahead for the Halloween party. It is a lot of fun in my experience, and is their other wild-side party of the year. Be forewarned, you cannot bring in alcohol (they have security who will check your bags), and you need cash to buy tickets at the door as well as drinks inside. Just beyond the back porch you will find a table where you can purchase tickets for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. If you have a body bubble, you'll probably be uncomfortable, because these events are always super crowded and you have to  be one of the first in line if you want even a chance at a seat.

My husband and I live a couple of blocks away from this charming piece of history. The menu is very limited (hamburgers and hot dogs) but everything that can be gotten from a local grower or manufacturer is. They have a great variety of Southwestern toppings that they will chop and grill freshly for every burger and dog. The fries are freshly cut and delicious. The guys that run the diner are friendly and the prices are reasonable. The hours are from 11 am to 3 pm Monday through Saturday and it is a cash only operation (my only complaints!). The counter inside is tiny and seats less than 10. There are some tables outside, and a take-out window. When we were there, Matt, the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, was also getting lunch, and it was great to hear how a number of the owners of the downtown small restaurants and shops are long time friends and all support each other. Quaint places with young, hip owners, offering high quality food and goods make us feel positively about living in an often maligned part of town. We'll be back often to support the Welcome Diner.

My husband is a huge donut fan, so when I noticed this place driving down McDowell, I suggested we go. One drawback is that they only accept cash, so we had to go to the Circle K ATM first. The donuts were fresh, and the cake varieties have become our favorites: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, dipped in chocolate or vanilla glaze. I had a custard-filled raised donut once, and the custard was clearly out of a can- and maybe an old one at that. The coffee is quite good, and you can fix it your way with sugar and non-dairy liquid creamer. The place itself is a bit of a dive- old and shabby, but clean.

In response to a recent thread about Boba drinks in CenPho, I said that Rainbow served at least 1 flavor- chai- which my husband found to be "just ok." When Hubby asked me this morning if I wanted to "taste the Rainbow" for breakfast, I asked him to check on the Boba situation. It turns out that Rainbow listened, and they now will add Boba to any of their drinks. The woman behind the counter said you can call ahead so you don't have to wait. Hubby's vanilla and my strawberry frap that he brought home today were still "just ok." The donuts are still really good, and they finally have some stable hours, 4 am to 8 pm.

Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me?   If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.  Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique.   For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing.   The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.  I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).

The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, "What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago.   Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.

Maybe the current economy has forced Tacos de Juarez to make some cutbacks in the quality of their food, because our recent experience was nowhere near as good as everyone else seems to have had. We live mere blocks from here, so we felt it was about time we tried it.   The chips and tostada base tasted off, as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid. The cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful- and pretty oily. My husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had, as was the relleno batter.   I ordered a #1, but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada. I checked the a la carte prices, and knew that the taco was actually less expensive, so I was sure I wasn't going to be screwing them over. I can't tell you how long it took me to try and explain what I wanted to our server. I'm sure there are those who would say it's my fault for not speaking Spanish. Anyway, I ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco, but no taquito, and no rice and beans. Then another 10 minutes of my life went by as I tried to explain again what I had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright, but that really, no one needed to bring me out any more food. I had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a Pepcid AC kind of night. The cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong. They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.  We've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return.

I love, love, love Eliana's. I have been eating here for years and enjoy bringing people new to Salvadoran food. The interior is cheerfully decorated with colorful folk art, and the service is always swift and friendly.   My favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas, kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good!; 2) the yucca frita, fried yucca plant (very starchy, like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink, a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream, a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods, but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious.  Eliana's is so inexpensive and such a wonderful experience. Everyone can find something they'll like- low spiciness, but full of great flavors and textures.

Red Devil catered a Junior Classical League (for students of Latin and Greek) lunch for our annual convention last month. Getting the food was one of my responsibilities and I had considered deli trays and had also looked at a few other catering places on line. All I knew is that I'd sooner die than call Fazoli's (who has often catered this lunch before). So it struck me suddenly with about a week to go- Red Devil! It's Italian, so it fits the theme, and we have always had a good meal there when we've gone.   I stopped in to see the GM, Doug, and he took my order, assuring me that the portions listed for the hotel pan sizes I was getting are generous- I was feeding teenagers, after all, so I had my concerns. I was relieved that they could easily and pleasantly take my order so late in the game. They dropped off the food at our location on time, hot and fresh, and they even brought the napkins, plates, and plastic-ware.   The food was a HUGE hit with everyone. The first pan to be emptied was the meat lasagna, followed by the chicken lasagna, and then the veggie penne pastas, one with chicken. The rolls were fantastic, and they even gave us plenty of real butter. Even the salads were by far a bigger hit with the kids than I had expected. And Doug was right- there was plenty of food and lots of people went back for seconds.  Best of all, when I gave the receipt to the treasurer of the organization, she was shocked at how low the price was, since last year, Fazoli's had cost close to twice as much! There is absolutely no comparison between the two when it comes to quality.  I would heartily recommend Red Devil for your catering needs- as well as for dinner. My colleagues and I have since fielded many requests from attendees and their parents for the name of the restaurant and we will continue to use them from now on whenever our convention is in the Phoenix area. Gratias vobis ago, Doug and Red Devil!

Now, I expect to get stoned with a hundred stale tortillas over this one, but I would rather shop at Food City than the Pro's Ranch Market for my Mexican food needs any day. Why? I'll tell you.  1. FC is far less crowded, chaotic, and full of rude people who make me feel that I shouldn't be shopping here. I have never in my life experienced the kind of oblivion to everyone else's existence and need to pass them in the aisles that I have in RM.   2. The in-house made tortillas and chips are far superior at FC to those in RM. Great taste, super fresh. Only Carolina's tortillas are better, in our opinion.  3. The produce, although not extensive at FC, is usually fresher and less bruised than at RM.  4. They have plenty of covered parking at FC. Covered parking! Why don't more businesses in AZ do this?   Yes, FC is in a far older building. Yes, FC is not the first place I usually think of when doing my grocery shopping. But for the items I simply cannot get at Safeway or Fry's, I'll continue getting them at Food City. Happily.

Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.  Starving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask.

So I e-mailed East Maryland the same afternoon as my visit, explaining that I was disappointed that the coupon I had given them was not honored, and they e-mailed me back before the end of the day, apologizing and letting me know that my Visa would be credited the amount of the coupon.   Then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots, and acknowledged the bill issue again, and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction.  This kind of immediate and friendly follow-up redeemed them and gained them another star.

Well, we now eat here about once a week. Our favorite food items are the crunchy roll, the tofu pad thai, the udon noodle soup, the tempura plate, and the surprisingly good tofu steak with mushroom sauce. And they have Mountain Dew- not all that common in a sit-down restaurant, but much appreciated. Love the banana blueberry bread.   Why not 5 stars? One word: service. It's fine on some days, and painfully slow on others. the food, except for the soup, never seems to make it out of the kitchen as fast - and therefore be as hot - as it should.

I stopped in at Karsh's today for the first time. The service I received was super friendly, and the young man behind the counter insisted I try a raspberry rugelach. It was pretty tasty, so I took home a loaf of seedless rye (one of my favorites), a black & white cookie, and 2 cupcakes.   Before I moved to Arizona, I worked as a bread baker in a restaurant, then in a bakery much like Karsh's, and then finally managed a bakery that made all natural and premium products more like Tammie Coe/MJ Bread. So I recognized immediately what Karsh's was using. Both cupcakes were made from a mix. The fudgy frosting is a commercial product. I know. I used it. The white frosting is made with vegetable shortening, not butter. The black & white cookie was like no black & white I have ever had. It was so thick and cakey- not at all a crisp cookie. Neither my husband nor I cared for it. The rye bread barely tasted of rye, although it had a decent texture. It was pretty heavy on the white flour. I've had better from Fry's.  For me, Karsh's was a big disappointment. IMHO, locally, no one's bread matches MJ's and no one's baked goods match Tammie Coe's.

We've been twice now, and nothing we have had has been very good. The ice cream and cake were mediocre, the onion rings were crispy-initially, the burgers were WAY overdone and made from cheap beef. Ask the bone chip in my husband's burger. The mushrooms were the canned pieces and stems variety, and the fries were crispy but heavy. The cole-slaw was excessively sweet and completely limp.   The service has ranged from complete disinterest- no greeting, no eye-contact, and I had to beg for refills- to interactions between employees so uncomfortable that I wanted to say something. It's great if you have rapport, but the customers don't need to see you slap each other around and overhear you gossiping about each other- even in play. Or, if you hate your job at 5 & Diner, please find another one and stop throwing the dishes around at a volume that hurts my ears and ruins my experience.   Management needs to intervene before this Phoenix institution falls apart.

I felt a little ill after our experience yesterday at the Verizon store. It could have been the questionable food at the Baja Fresh we ate afterward. But, no- it really was the see-sawing of our entire lengthy transaction.   We were due for the "new every 2" deal, but, wouldn't you know it- the prices for the phones we wanted that Hubby had been quoted in an e-mail expired 2 days before! Then we needed to go back out on the floor to look for more affordable models.   Bonus point for the salesman getting Hubby a gov't employee discount on the phone plan and accessories.  Bonus point for finally having a device in house that will transfer your contacts and photos for you. Minus a point for his lame joke about it costing $10. Minus a point for his inability to transfer my pics when he could transfer Hubby's.   Minus 2 points for screwing up the rebate process by ringing up the same phone twice, so now the UPC codes on the box and the rebate form don't match. So much for reminding us so often about the glorious $50 rebate per phone, that finally made us choose to go with the original phones we had wanted in the first place. So now I have to squeeze in a trip back to the store sometime very soon before the whole deal expires, or possibly and tragically lose my- wait for it....wait for it.... f-ing "Verizon Debit Card." WTF? The sales rep never said anything about a debit card. Can I only conveniently use it at a Verizon store? Shockingly, the rebate printout does not say specifically.  I like my new phone well enough, and I have been a Verizon customer for many many years and have not ever had trouble with them. However, I don't think I'll shop anywhere but online again for my phone needs. The human factor made the shopping icky.

"Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?"  "Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile."  'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.  I got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager "saved" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. "Why don't you like caraway?" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, "I really don't like the taste." When she asked me "Why?" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the "sauce" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that "real" texture. Foul, foul, foul.   Hence, the grilled cheese.

The real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen, just so you know. We had to stifle a sneer when the waiter tried to push dessert on us. I have had their cheesecake before this, and it just isn't very good.  We are also huge fans of The Big Bang Theory, and since Penny works there, and Sheldon will actually eat there, how bad could it be? Analysis: not *bad*, just decidedly mediocre.  I had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as "fine" but otherwise unremarkable.  Sorry, Penny. I hope your salary on the show increases due to the heavy product placement fees that CF must be paying, but we won't be back.

Hubby and I decided to have a celebratory (new job) dinner, and were tempted by all the recent Yelp steak house debates to try Mastro's. But while going through a pile of mail I had set aside as junk, I found a $50 off postcard from AM-EX to Capital Grille. We decided to give it a try and save Mastro's for another time.  The service was fantastic. Our waiter, Reuben, was just the right amount of attentive (I hate being asked after practically every bite if everything is ok), and the other staff was also excellent.  We got a basket of bread to start, which also held some matzo-like crackers. Don't pass by the dark bread- I thought it was regular pumpernickel at first, but it had a wonderful crust with a soft and slightly fruity center- totally unexpected and delicious. We also received an amuse- a great little bruchetta topped with micro greens.  I ordered the caprese salad which was good, especially the yellow tomato slice, but I have had better mozzarella at Cibo. Hubby had the French Onion soup which came with a ridiculous amount of torch-melted cheese on top. The soup itself had great flavor (one of the best I've had), but could have been a little hotter for my taste. Hubby liked it the way it was.  For our entrees, Hubby got the Kona crusted sirloin (which was rubbed with a blend of decaf coffee powder, cocoa, and cinnamon) with shallot butter. He really enjoyed the flavor, although about half of his steak was really much more medium than medium rare. To me, the flavor was unexpected- I thought I would taste any one of the rub flavors before I tasted the steak, as they are all strong flavors. That was not the case, however- it was a subtle yet complex addition to the beef. I had the classic Delmonico rib-eye. Mine was perfectly done and quite tasty, although I must say that I have enjoyed my rib-eye at Bobby Q's every bit as much. The sides were fine- we tried the mushroom mix and the lobster mac n' cheese. We have been spoiled by our CraftSteak hen-of-the-woods mushroom ecstasy experience, so all else pales in comparison. I expected more from the mac- it was sort of mild and bland. I'm not sure what it needed- something that wouldn't overwhelm the lobster, but something nonetheless. Because we wanted to try a dessert, we took home plenty of food (the sides are large, and all share-able by 2-4 people).  We shared the coconut cream pie, which again was more than enough for two. It was in a tart style with a sugar cookie type crust, topped with a layer that we felt had cream cheese in it, then a layer of custard cream, covered by a mountain of fresh whipped barely sweetened cream and toasted coconut flakes. It was really delicious. The house blend coffee was truly outstanding, without even a hint of acidity. Hubby added Frangelico to his, and it was so good and rich that it did not need the cream he would have otherwise added.   All in all, Capital Grille gave us a very pleasant dining experience (aside from a couple of wasted chicks who were way too loud), and very good food.

We've been taking our three cats to the Animal Care Hospital for a year now. The staff is wonderful and truly loves animals. Dr. Temple is especially great, and although the hospital offers many tests and expensive maintenance procedures, she understands financial constraints, and is kind enough not to guilt you about passing on the $500 echo-cardiogram. She has little tricks to distract the cats while they are getting their shots and offers a number of over-the-counter and inexpensive solutions to try for minor ailments or bad feline habits. They have an on-line "pet portal" service so you can keep track of your pets' records and when boosters are due. The office is always clean, and they have at least 3 doctors, so you can usually get an appointment pretty quickly as well as bring in pets for emergencies.

The Embassy Suites saved the lives of my cats. When I was out of town, my husband and I had an air conditioning emergency at our Cen-Pho house. It would take a few days to fix, and the temperature in the house rose past 109 degrees. All of our animals were suffering significantly. After we called a few other nearby hotels and were brushed off or denied, the Embassy Suites agreed right away to bend their pet occupancy rules and allow all three of our kitteh "children" to stay since it was an emergency. The staff, including the nice man who picked me up from the airport, were all wonderful. The price was excellent for a large suite with a king sized bed, living and dining areas, and a kitchen. There was a free cocktail and bar snax time every evening, and a free hot breakfast every morning, with made to order omelets.   Is this the best hotel I've ever stayed at? No. It's an older property in an older part of Phoenix. But their quick and considerate action makes it 5 star worthy in my book. Thank you, Embassy Suites, for having a heart and for being a comfortable and generous place to stay when we couldn't be in our own home.

I recently received a $100 gift card to Ruth's Chris from my students, so Hubby and I decided to use it last night. Overall, we had an excellent meal.   Hubby had the gumbo as a starter. It was very flavorful, but had a little less heat than he would have preferred- maybe with the addition of a couple of dashes of Tabasco, he said, it would have been awesome. I had the Caprese salad with thick slices of beautifully ripe and flavorful beefsteak tomato, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, and a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I appreciated that they let the tomato and mozzarella be the star by not drowning it in dressing. I absolutely loved the addition of a big piece of flash fried basil, which is something I have seen done a few times on cooking shows recently. Unexpectedly scrumptious.  Both our steaks were perfectly cooked (but you need to be aware that Ruth's Chris tends to under-cook slightly, so a medium-rare is just barely so, flirting with rare). Hubby had the buffalo rib-eye Chef's special which was farm-raised, our server told us, so the meat was not very gamey. It was firmer than a standard rib-eye, but less fatty, and very flavorful. He got it with a mustard crust, which was overkill. I had the regular rib-eye, and it was wonderful. We shared a sauteed mushroom side.   Neither of us came close to finishing the huge portions, especially because we were saving some room to share the creme brulee. It came just slightly warmed with a perfect sugar crust and beautiful fresh berry garnish. It is one of the best brulees I have ever had- even better than I can make myself! :) The coffee was mediocre.  Is Ruth's Chris the best steak we have ever had? No- that would be Craftsteak in Vegas, but it's still worth the money. Our biggest complaint was our garrulous server- just this side of arrogant and annoying. He must have spent a half-hour loudly waxing poetic about wine, his grandparents, and Chicago to the people behind us, while we sat neglected. And we were amused to note that some of what he said was inaccurate. Oh well, don't know the answer? Bullshit like you do!

My husband and I eat here pretty regularly. Is "traditional" Hawaiian boxed lunch fare healthy? Not so much. Spam is on the menu, people!Think grilled or fried chicken, fish, or beef, sticky white rice, and the most delicious macaroni salad ever. I've not cared for the appetizers, frankly, but we have only tried the Spam musubi and the Crab "Langoons". We really like the BBQ chicken and especially the chicken katsu (breaded chicken cutlets cut into strips- dip into the fabulous zingy katsu sauce). They also have soups, burgers, and salads. The portions are quite large for a "regular" meal. I always make 2 meals out of it, but Hubby can usually finish his. Aloha Kitchen does a few things better (and also has great Kahlua pig on Saturdays which Ono never has), but for a quick and filling out of the ordinary weekday dinner, Ono hits the spot.

We decided to spruce up the yard this weekend, since it was cool outside and the recent rain had made the ground softer than normal. Based on D.D.'s great review, we drove to Baker Nursery this morning. The place is HUGE, but almost all of it is cool and shady, so walking around and looking at all they had would be pleasant, even on a "normal" Phoenix summer day. They have all manner of indoor plants, outdoor plants and shrubs, trees, pottery, and a greenhouse.  We don't frequent nurseries, but the prices seemed really reasonable and the plants all looked healthy. We ended up with 4 plants for the outside and 1 for Hubby's desk at work. The staff was easy-going, friendly and knowledgeable. The main person we talked to even pointed out a couple of hummingbirds' nests as we passed by them just because they were cool. If I decide to be ambitious this summer and do some more planting (in the wee hours of the AM of course) I'll return to Baker.

My husband's new obsession is saltwater tanks and I have been dragged to just about every store in the valley. This is by far the best store dedicated to the supplies needed for reef maintenance. They also have a small section for freshwater.  They have premixed salt water (bring your jugs, they will fill them), a wide variety of fish, and some shrimp, snails, eels, urchins, and crabs. They have the best selection of live rock and both soft and hard corals I have seen and they all seem to be responsibly harvested.  The store is bright and impeccably clean and the tanks are well maintained. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable. If you're going to get involved in an expensive hobby like this, you may as well buy from the best.  Aqua Touch's hours: Monday-Saturday 11-7 Sunday 12-5

Thanks once again to the magicians at Red Devil for being the culinary hit of my recent student-oriented convention. You know how it's nearly impossible to get kids to turn things like permission slips and registration forms in on time? Well, Red Devil can accommodate! A basic order to feed over 200 was placed about 72 hours in advance (but they only require 48! Good to know for last minute big parties) and then was added to with no complaints the day before the event.   The biggest hits were the meat lasagna and the alfredo pasta with broccoli and large pieces of tender white chicken. The rolls and salads were gobbled up in no time. Red Devil even made a vegan pasta and a gluten-free salad for those with special dietary needs. Everything was delivered hot, fresh, and on time, complete with plastic ware, plates, and napkins.   Last year, due to the location of the convention, I used my local McDowell Red Devil. This year, it was at my school in NoSco, so we went with the Bell location. It's great to know that there is consistency in the quality of the food, generous quantity, and outstanding service at both locations.   Red Devil, te amo!

Dragon Palace has become my new go-to Chinese place. After having brought home dinner from here several times, Hubby and I decided to eat in last night. It was a totally solid meal once again.   The egg drop soup is like no other I have ever had- thick, savory, and eggy, with small squares of tofu and red bell pepper. I am normally repulsed by anything with bell pepper, but this stuff is so delicious, I can totally overlook it. This time, I decided to try the won ton soup, and it, too, was awesome- savory and full of perfectly cooked won tons with little nuggets of pork inside, topped with green onions. Delicious.   We also got the crab puffs- again, these are some of the best I've had in Phoenix. They also have regular and vegetarian egg rolls. I don't think the latter are on the menu, but just ask for them. They are pretty good.   I have had the house special chicken, the sweet and sour pork (minus the bell pepper, of course), and the three seas (scallops, shrimp, and chicken with snow peas and bamboo in a light sauce). All are very good, very generously portioned, and almost entirely meat. The scallops in particular were so well cooked, and next time I go I will have a scallop dish. Hubby has had three types of vegetarian entrees- the family bean curd, the veggie and egg crepes, and the mushrooms, peas, and bamboo combo- and he has enjoyed them all.   They do not deliver, but do a brisk takeout business. While we were dining, they had someone picking something up every few minutes. They are super fast with the takeout, even with special requests. You will wait only 10 minutes and have everything well packaged and ready for transport. Everything is still hot when I get home, even after more than half an hour drive.   Dragon Palace does not have everything on the menu that I would want in my ideal Chinese restaurant, but it comes close. Everything we have eaten has been good at the very least, and often among the best we've had in the Phoenix metro, and the prices are very reasonable.

We decided to stop for a bite at Bobby C's tonight before we went to Symphony Hall via Metro Rail. It's right across from the Washington and 12th Street station.   The staff were all super friendly and told us that times had been hard during construction, but that now things are so good, they are also open for lunch. They have live music quite often- jazz, Latin jazz, and blues.  It took quite a while for our food to come out, but it was really good when it arrived. The mac & cheese was among the best we've had in town, and my Southern fried chicken was four large whole wings with a super savory coating. Totally delicious! They also have a veggie plate- your choice of any 3 of their sides. Hubby had the black-eyed peas (loved 'em!), the yams (sweet and yummy) and mashed potatoes (tasted like boxed to me). They also serve the muffins my husband remembers from his many years  in the South- really sweet and tender like a cross between corn muffins and white cake. The iced tea was really fresh.   Somebody tell John V. he doesn't have to be scared anymore. Bobby C's is definitely on the map, and he won't be "the only white guy in here" anymore.

Hubby has a thing for French Dips, so when the flier came in the mail advertising Rock Bottom's new Firehouse Specials, he really wanted to go, especially since we were in the area anyway.   The French Dip was on a "pretzel roll" and my bite had soooooo much horseradish on it, I couldn't swallow it, and the bun was almost immediately mush. He also did not care for the beer "jus" it came with. His sweet potato hash side looked overdone and simply not appetizing. He also had an Irish stout that he really liked.  I ordered a tasty portabello and spinach sandwich on a nice wheat roll with rosemary mayo. The fries that came with it were light and yummy. I thought I had by far the better of the two meals- until I spent a good part of the rest of the night on the potty. 'Nuff said. This is a family show.

Hubby and I met a couple of friends here for dinner tonight. It is a small restaurant, nothing much to look at, but the service was super friendly and amazingly fast.  I had egg rolls that were pretty awful- inside was a ground up unidendifiable mash. Really couldn't identify the tastes either. Hubby's spring roll was nothing to write home about, and he thought that the ones he had at Pholicious were far better.   My entree was quite tasty, though- the beef chow fun (dry) might just have been the best I've had in the Valley. Hubby had to add all the sauces given to him just to give his tofu and veggie noodle dish some flavor. One friend loves their curry pho, and the other friend just repeatedly called her dish "spicy" and didn't eat much of it.  We've had better overall and will keep searching for a good pho place- and one in our part of town.

My husband and I went twice last week, and intend to return once a week until we move out of Gilbert. Hidden behind the Arby's across the street from Dana Park, we missed it the first time, but it's when we leave this area that we'll truly miss Nando's.  The menu is great, with plenty of classics and unique dishes. We were so pleased by the relatively large number of vegetarian items and learned from our very nice and helpful server Lisa that virtually any dish can be made vegetarian. Like Pollo Fundido (they call it Pollo Rico) but don't want the chicken? They'll fill the burrito with fajita veggies and potatoes instead. My husband had the Enchiladas Ongos (mushrooms with a chipotle cream sauce) and it was to die for. My Pollo Rico was huge, fresh, and outstanding. I've had better beans and rice, but they were fine. The second time we went, Bob had a veggie chimichanga and I had the Barrio Tacos. He really enjoyed his ginormous chimi, and my tacos were pretty good, but I have had more flavorful and tender carne asada elsewhere.   On our first visit we had the cheese crisp, which came with a deep fried tortilla bottom and tons of good quality cheese on top. Delicious, but a little heavy. We decided that the second time we would save room for the chocolate nachos, and they turned out to be just ok- the concept was far better than the final execution. The chocolate tortilla chips were thick and the flavor was not what I had expected.   The service was absolutely fantastic both times, and the atmosphere is very open and friendly. I love the wrought iron decor. The prices are reasonable for the portions, and they have the lime mints I love as you go out the door. Our first server told us that she has been with this restaurant since they opened- 6 or 7 years now. That says a lot about the people who run the place- they inspire loyalty in both their customers and their staff.

Jolta Java is my new favorite coffeehouse. It's close to my school so I can stop in on my way there and get an awesome cup of coffee and the best breakfast sandwich around- bacon, eggs, and cheddar on a croissant. Heavenly. The homemade coffee cake is also incredibly rich and delicious. They are open early and have great staff who are friendly and fast. By my third time in, I was greeted by name.  I like the customer number system- no cards to be punched and lost- and every 10th drink is free. On Mondays you can get a free extra shot in your coffee- an awesome perk on the right day. Another thoughtful touch are the stickers they put on the lid opening to prevent spillage and loss of heat.   Jolta, I'm so glad I found you- you have another regular, for sure!

As an MS patient, I've had my fair share of MRI's in the last few years. They can range from mildly uncomfortable and headache-inducing (due to the clicking, clacking, and jack-hammering sounds) to ones that have left me shaking and crying.   SimonMed in Scottsdale has been the best experience by far. I was able to get an appointment before 7:00 AM, so I could be to work on time. The waiting room is very nicely decorated and completely spotless. The dressing rooms are super large and have a laundry basket, bench, chair, TV, and some toiletries. You actually get scrubs to wear rather than dignity robbing open gowns. It's the little touches like these that can make all the difference as to how comfortable you feel going in. And that in turn makes the time you must spend perfectly still in a tiny tube easier.  The staff was all friendly, but my tech was completely awesome. I wish I could remember his name. He spoke to me like an adult, gave me headphones tuned to the radio station of my choice, told me exactly what scans were coming and when I would be injected with contrast solution. He also performed the injection perfectly so that there was almost no pain, virtually no blood, and zero bruising afterward. He asked about my previous MRI experiences, and when I told him about my worst one, he said he could do the same scan in 1/2 the time.   I know I will need to continue to get MRI's, and I sincerely hope that I will be able to keep getting them at SimonMed. They are total professionals in a state-of-the-art and comfortable environment. Highly recommended for all of your health scanning needs.

The Greenway Grill is around the corner from my school in a rather industrial neighborhood close to the Scottsdale Airport. Their primary business seems to be delivery to local businesses. So I called to see if they could cater an event I was hosting at the school last weekend, and even though they are not normally open on Saturdays, this husband and wife team came in to do our 150+ boxed lunches.   They accommodated a number of preferences and sensitivities from vegan to gluten free to dairy free, and did it all at a reasonable price. The sandwiches were hearty and tasty, on good bread, and came with a cookie, chips, and condiments. They arrived on time and everything that was made for the special diets was clearly labeled and explained to the volunteers staffing the lunch.   Thanks, Greenway Grill, for making lunch at my students' convention one less thing I had to worry about!

So the framed pencil drawing of a Rodin sculpture of Medusa that one of my best college girlfriends did when we were freshmen, which I have hung in my classroom for the last 12 years, mysteriously cracked in my closet this summer. I'd like to blame the cats, who find rooting around in my closet and tearing down whatever's on hangers to make themselves a little nesty-poo endlessly fun.   What I like about Hall of Frames more than Michael's: in-house framing and glass replacement. No need for them to send stuff out and for it to come back weeks later. Professionals are handling my precious drawing, not underpaid kids. It's also 3 doors down from Ice Tango. Nice combo trip. The staff was saucy without being obnoxious, and made recommendations that I knew should be done anyway. It was still a tad pricey, but it seems like all framing work is more than you would expect it to be. They do have a savings card a-la the grocery stores, which is somewhat stupid. But will I whip that bad boy out the next time I need something framed? You betcha.

Damn some of the gift cards I get as a teacher. I feel obligated to use them, even if I'd really rather not. The $30 I just got for Joe's Crab Shack was such a dilemma. So Hubby and I went yesterday since we would be in the area anyway. Our expectations were pretty low, so some elements of the meal actually met or even exceeded those expectations.  We had the seafood fondue appetizer, which was OK, but complete garbage compared to Pappadeaux's. Hubby had the shrimp po-boy which came in a traditional presentation but with fried shrimp that he described as one step above cocktail shrimp. I myself would not have taken it so far, and out of pity, I gave him a bunch of superior shrimp from my platter. I had a reasonably decent mix of coconut, Parmesan panko, and seasoned fried shrimp. I also made the wise choice of asking for a sub of onion rings instead of fries. Hubby's fries were inedible, as if they had been triple fried. Hard as a rock. My onion rings were thin and mostly crispy. At least they tasted fresh.   When the bill came, we were rather shocked. It was pretty pricey at over $40 for lunch. Frankly, I wasn't all that thrilled about spending nearly $20 (with tip) after my gift card was applied. When you consider that we would have gotten a far superior meal at Pete's Fish and Chips for about $12, Joe's is a sad place- no wonder they were practically empty.  UPDATE: I just returned from a wedding where I happened to run into a former student who works at the Joe's at Arizona Mills Mall. She said her store has been rated the best in the Southwest, whereas this Southern & McClintock store is just not very good.

With the kind of quick, friendly, and personal service you get at Mail Plus, you'd be a fool to go to the Tempe Post Office. They are open in the shopping plaza on the corner of Southern and McClintock, right next to Back East Bagels, Monday-Friday, 9-6, and Saturday, 10-4. They have shipping boxes and supplies, padded envelopes, stamps, an awesome greeting card selection, fax services and a photocopier. It is run by wonderful people who go out of their way to be helpful (boxing up packages for you) and accommodating (Joe special ordered the new wedding stamps for me last year). They will mail your items in any manner or speed you need, and will happily give you all of your price options. Never again should anyone in Tempe waste precious time in heinous lines just to get grouchy dead-eyed service at the PO like a sucker.

Unlike some other reviewers, Hubby and I have never had horrible customer service at Pets Inc. A few months ago they pared down to focus on salt and freshwater fish, reptiles, and some gross things with exoskeletons (DON'T make me tell you the story about how when I was seven and we had just moved to Florida and there was a locust plague and you couldn't walk ANYWHERE without stepping on them- and how this started a lifetime of severe exo-phobia). They do still have ferrets, however, and the occasional chinchilla.  I probably shop there once a week, as it is conveniently on my way home from work. The petite pig-tailed blonde in the reptile section has always been super friendly and will take out all manner of lizards for you to hold. Will in the fish section is awesome, and according to his roommate (who also works there) he seems to have some "groupie customers."   Outside of Aqua Touch, Pets Inc has the best fish and coral selection I have seen in the valley. There are other stores with some more exotic critters, but there has always been something else to turn me off- dirty tanks, the stale smell of piss... Pets Inc is not as spic and span, nor as high-end as Aqua Touch, but is far superior to most in the quality and variety of your more basic tank needs.

I used to find Guy Fieri of "Diners Drive-Ins and Dives" mildly amusing, but when I discovered that he is promoting a place like Thee Pitts Again and bypassing true local gems like LoLo's and Welcome Diner, I decided he needs a palate check.   Hubby and I actually went after seeing it on the show, in spite of the piggy kitsch factor. The zucchini app was mushy on the inside and crispy on the outside (due to too much greasy tempura, in my opinion). My pulled pork was acceptable, but the ribs were scant on meat and drowning in sauce. I got the waiter to spill the beans on the mashed potatoes- 1/2 real and 1/2 instant, and they were so garlicky they were acrid. Hubby got the only moderately tasty thing we ordered- the pork tenderloin. Two HUGE pieces breaded in the same tempura as the zucchini- very moist, somewhat bland, and definitely a heart attack waiting to happen. We took the second piece home and split it for dinner the next day. Hubby liked his potato salad well enough, and the cornbread was OK in taste but very crumbly and therefore hard to eat.  No need for us to return.

The highlights: (1) You can feed giraffes! Climb up a raised platform and get pellet food from coin operated vending machines. Bring quarters! (2) The big cat enclosures are awesome. Part of their cages are over your head and while we were there, we got to see both a panther and a leopard from about a foot away.  (3) Lots of birds and monkeys, including some kinds I had never seen before.  (4) The aquarium is small, but growing. In 2010, they will be building an addition to include a 40,000 gallon South American exhibit, a jellyfish tank, and otters. Currently, they have some cool things like a shark tank, nautilus, a large ray touch tank, barracudas, moray eels, a giant alligator snapping turtle, and some awesomely weird stone fish.  It's a tad pricey at $28.00 for adults, and you need to bring additional cash for any of the snack shacks since only the gift shop and main ticket area at the entrance take plastic. There are ATM's, but few were working order, and the prices were typical for an amusement park.  Overall, we had a great time, and WWZ is a nice place to have in AZ, especially since they seem to be doing a very good job with the animals themselves. They have some successful breeding programs, and the animals all seemed healthy.

After the first leg of our flight to Ohio for Christmas, I was almost willing to forgive US Airways for the string of delays that made me miss the last moments of my mother's life and had me sobbing in the terminal. That was close to 10 years ago, the last time I flew with them.   Then, on the flight back to Phoenix, we had to be detoured to Memphis due to a fuel pump failure. After we land, they figure out that no one there knows how to do repairs on our specific type of plane (probably because it was ancient). Great. They tow us to another terminal and apparently someone there knows something because we eventually take off again. We arrive in Phoenix 3 1/2 hours late. Then it takes more than 1/2 an hour for the luggage to start coming off the carousel- at a f*cking trickle. You would think someone might have hustled to avoid a riot from the already pissed off passengers.  Another thing I hated was the credit card push. I mean the flight attendants had to stroll down the aisle with fanned out applications and an embarrassed grin.   Never again, US Airways. Never again.

Hubby and I attended the January 5, 2008 Opening Night of the Pajama Game- in our pajamas. The majority of the patrons did not, however, and we got some weird looks, but they either did not read the New Times article encouraging such attire, or were too stuffy to dare.   I should start by saying that cheery musicals have never been my thing (if it needs to be a musical, give me Sweeney Todd). However, that does not mean I can't appreciate excellent performances and choreography. The basic premise of the show is union workers at a pajama factory gearing up for a strike for a 7-1/2 cent raise, but centers on a romance between Babe, the grievance committee, and Sid, the new supervisor. The Arizona Theatre Company struck gold when they got Kevyn Morrow to play Sid as he gave the stand-out performance of the night. Joel Newsome was very funny-and creepy- as Prez, and Emily Mulligan-Ferry's Mae had the biggest personality among the girls (extra props to a fellow teacher!). I liked the chemistry between the time-keeper Hines (played by an absolutely hilarious Bob Sorenson) and the big boss' secretary, Gladys (Michelle Aravena) even more than that between Sid and Babe and their "Jealousy Ballet" near the end was one of my favorite numbers. The choreography was especially great in "Once a Year Day," "Steam Heat," and "Hernando's Hideaway." The sherbet colored set and the vibrant costuming (especially for the ladies) added to the atmosphere, and the timing of orchestra and the actors was wonderfully in sync.  Overall, The Pajama Game was a fun show and the Herberger is a great venue. Parking at the garage on 2nd St. and Monroe seems best, and unless there is another major event going on, there should be ample spaces. It was pricier at $10 than it has been at other times. I'm looking forward to ATC's upcoming shows "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "To Kill a Mockingbird."

I made arrangements for my fellow faculty members to have an in-service at the PAM, specifically to see "Elihu Vedder's Drawings for the Rubaiyat," their current special exhibit. Have I been to better art museums in this country? Sure, but I really do appreciate the great traveling shows the PAM curators get to come here, and I have enjoyed many in the years I have lived here.   The Vedder exhibit was great, and I highly recommend it to fans of Vedder and of Omar Khayyam, the scientist, philosopher, and poet whose words Vedder interprets in his amazing drawings. In a nutshell, the Rubaiyat expresses Khayyam's frustration with the infighting of theologians and philosophers, and dissatisfaction with the "answers" they give for the meaning of life. He feels this life is fleeting, so we should live for the pleasant moments, drinking, eating, and loving while we can. PAM has secured this collection from the Smithsonian, and if you are unfamiliar with the Rubaiyat, or with Vedder, I would suggest going on a tour. We all learned a lot, and were blown away by the art, even if our docent made a mistake or two. This special exhibit runs through Feb. 8, 2009.   PAM also has outreach programs to local schools as well as provides group tours and lectures. It's a wonderful addition to our city, and one that should be better appreciated that it often seems to be.

In the not so wide world of Soul Food in Phoenix, my ranking would be:  4. Baby Kay's (although I hear things have recently taken a nosedive here) 3. Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe 2. Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles 1. Stacy's Smokehouse  Hubby might flip 1 and 2 since he has an addiction to the waffles. The best he's ever had, he says. They are very good, and so is the chicken, but I have recently discovered Stacy's superior version. The sweet tea is hella sweet to the point of total saturation, and everything is swimming in butter (Matt Poole must have taken this idea from here). The quality of the egg cookery varies quite a bit, and so does the red velvet cake (the last time I had it, it was burned).   Will any of the inconsistencies keep us from returning? Hell no. It's one of our absolute favorite dining experiences in the valley. We go as often as we think our hearts can take it!

Met Hubby here today for one of our last lunches together for the summer. It's the place he (and just about every other state employee, it seems) eats most often. It's a tiny little shop with a few tables crammed in and a mistered patio out back. The walls are lined with AZ memorabilia, license plates, and old timey signs. But for once, they're for real, not the fake old timey stuff that's on the walls of most chain restaurants. I'm lookin' at you, Cracker Barrel....  They have a great variety of subs, plus soups, salads, fruit bowls, a veritable wall o'chips, and baskets of sweet snax. Get the Rice Krispie treat. You know you wanna. The subs were quite good- and huge. Had I known how big, I would absolutely have ordered a half. Tons of fresh veggies, lite on the mayo, a tad heavy on the dressing. Dallas is right- the ice is awesome. It's the perfect crush, so that, according to my husband, he can keep on chewing it long after he gets back to his desk and NOT annoy the crap out of his fellow cubies.

Big Wong just gave me a food-gasm!  Being Wong virgins, Hubby and I decided to get the Family Style Dinner so we could try a wide variety of menu items. The waitress/owner warned us it was a lot of food, and she did not lie.   We started with a bowl of delicious egg drop soup which was quite eggy and also chock full of sliced veggies. Next came the po-po platter with flavorful and perfectly cooked tempura shrimp, beef stick (cooked to medium, very tender and tasty), pork ribs so tasty my "I don't eat things with bones" Hubby sucked it clean, yummy veggie egg rolls, and the best crab rangoons I have had in a long time.   Already getting full, the entrees came next and they were so good we had to have some of each. We ordered the stir-fried scallops which came with plenty of fresh and crunchy veggies in a light garlic sauce, and the house lo-mein which was full of shrimp and pork and chicken. The noodles were perfectly cooked and flavorful. It all came with a heaping side of fried rice which seemed to have as much pork pieces, egg, shrimp, and veggies as rice. It was a ridiculous amount of food and we have more than enough left over for dinner tomorrow. It really struck me that the meat was of a higher quality than at almost any other Chinese restaurant I have been to in the Valley, and they also know how to prepare and cook seafood properly- a Phoenix rarity.   Having read online that they make their own ice cream, Hubby and I simply had to try it. They have two flavors: coconut with chopped peanuts on top and a bright green one that gets some flavor from coconut, but the rest of the flavor and its color from a Chinese leaf that the owner says they use a lot in making desserts. Both were absolutely delicious. A little more icy than the super-premium double-churned ice creams most of us are used to, but I thought it was really light and refreshing.  But- the owner gave us some potentially bad news. They are having some lease renewal disagreements, and may close by the end of the year, and may or may not open at another location. Go, go, go to Big Wong and experience this culinary treasure before it's too late. Hours are 11:00-2:30 M-F and 5:00-10:00 every night for dinner.

On my way home from Safeway this morning, I had 2 belts blow, causing a series of bolt breakages and general ricocheted dinging of the inside of my car. Hubby called AAA, and the tow truck driver (great guy- wish I'd gotten his name) recommended Bethany Auto Repair because he knew they were open on Saturdays. Not knowing any small repair shops in the area, I said OK- lucky for me. They were professional and courteous, explaining exactly what happened and what they needed to replace and repair. They did all of that TODAY, at the time they said they would have it done, and squeezed in an oil change to boot- all for a price I felt was fair. They are on the corner of 7th Ave and Bethany- ask for Tom or Joe.

Hubby and I wanted to try someplace new to us tonight without breaking the bank, and Maxim's, thanks to Yelp, had been on our radar. It IS a dive, but the food is very good and the staff, who somehow knew that we had never been there before, told us how we should eat our spring rolls and what to add to all of our other dishes.   The spring rolls were probably our favorite thing- well seasoned and delicious, we wrapped them in lettuce, mint and cilantro, drizzled the provided dressing, and chowed down. Mint in savory dishes is a new flavor for me- and I found that I really liked it. We shared a huge bowl of egg drop soup, which unlike most egg drop I have had, contained tofu squares and water chestnuts. Not my favorite, but Hubby enjoyed it more. We got what is one of our standard Asian menu items- dry sauteed chow fun (they called it something different). The smokiness of the beef reminded me more of Silver Dragon's preparation, but it wasn't exactly the best we've had. We both preferred the dish that the waitress suggested- with BBQ pork, noodles, a finely chopped "salad" underneath, a sliced spring roll on top, and dusted with peanuts- very fresh tasting.  The culinary surprise of the evening was the avocado shake. Hubby insisted, being a shake junkie, and even after he got burned on his salty fresh coconut drink. It was really very good- it tasted vaguely "green", lightly sweet, and very refreshing. The waitress insisted that next time, we need to try the tomato and the carrot. They also had a few other exotic fruit flavors, including durian, which even Andrew Zimmern (of Bizarre Foods on the Travel Channel) can't manage to choke down. So maybe not that one for me...  Overall, we really enjoyed Maxim and will for sure be back to try more dishes, but decided that Gourmet House of Hong Kong is still our gold standard.

We just got back from a surprisingly delicious breakfast at Bill Johnson's. Hubby had the Range Rider omelet with hash browns and biscuits and gravy. He especially liked the warm melty cheese on top and it was chock full of fresh veggies. The biscuits were super soft and fluffy, with a texture even better than the flavor. The gravy was a tad salty for his taste.   We both thought the hash browns were excellent. I normally don't even eat the hash browns that automatically come with many breakfasts due to their excessive greasiness and weird taste. I inhaled these. They were not greasy, but were perfectly tender and moist with great fresh flavor.   My over-easy eggs were well cooked and the toast came dry with a side of butter, which I also appreciated. I hate it when the toast comes basted with griddle grease. The chicken fried steak was very tender and tasty- not the best I've ever had, but better than most I've had in the Valley. The coffee was weak but not acidic at least. The portions are tremendous, so there will be no need for lunch. I also took home about 3/4 of my platter-sized steak, so that'll be dinner too.   The service was friendly and fast. We were very impressed that the deaf man who was seated by himself right before us got a waitress who knew sign language. I don't think you would find someone with that skill in most fine dining places. Yes, the neighborhood is sketchy, and yes, the restaurant is darker at breakfast than I would prefer, but will we be back for sure.

*****THIS RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED***** (We were there on closing night, by chance, and heard it from the owners' daughter's mouth- it was time for them to retire).   It's hard to choose between Silver Dragon and Gourmet House of Hong Kong. Hubby and I live mere blocks from GHoHK, and have had many excellent meals there. We'd read some reviews of SD in New Times, and decided to give it a try. Unlike the previous reviewer's experience, the place was full of Asians at dinner time. The "regular" menu had all the Americanized standards, but GHoHK had already trained us to be more adventurous with the second menu, written mostly in Chinese. Hubby and I agreed that the soups and the mixed appetizer plates are better at GHoHK, but that our entrees had better flavor at SD (although GHoHK's are prettier). Hubby had a mixed meat Singapore flat noodle with a curry sauce that, when we heated up the left-overs for dinner tonight, said was even better the second time. I had the beef chow fun, dry sauteed. Delicious. Both places are decor-dives, but clean, with fast and friendly service.

I had heard others talk about getting high quality cat and dog food for great prices at feed & tack stores. I never quite believed them until I decided to stop passing by Gordon's and wondering. I pulled in and saw the light.  Gordon's IS tiny, but with the help of the Grandson, I found "Taste of the Wild," a completely grain free all natural cat chow that is good for all ages, from kittens to seniors. My cats loved it from the get go and it was no more expensive than Purina One, but I sure feel a lot better feeding them this. They also carry "Petite Cuisine"- Fancy Feast sized cans of food that is the most wonderfully unprocessed cat food I have ever seen. Again, cheaper than the nationally recognized competition- far cheaper in fact, and far, far better for my cats with no fillers and no mystery meats.  The staff consisting of Grandmother, Mother, and Grandson are all very friendly, and the Grandson always volunteers to carry my purchases to the car. I'm sold on Gordon's for my pet food needs.

To be perfectly honest, Hubby and I went here because we wanted to check out  the cool building. And we like Sweet Tomatoes well enough, so we braved it in spite of some mediocre reviews. Let's just say I wasn't sure how fresh the lettuce was and if the cheese was real. No refills on drinks were offered while we were there. The selection was similar to Sweet Tomatoes, but lower quality. The soups didn't look great, so neither of us tried one- and they were different from what the website said they would be. The breads were ok, with the stand-out being the clearly from a mix cheesy drop-biscuit. Kinda sad. The pasta sauces looked off-color and the pizza appeared underdone and topped with cheap (again- real???) cheese. The desserts were alright- Hubby liked his non-dairy iced product in a cone well enough and I actually rather liked my strawberry shortcake. The inside of the building was not as cool as the outside, with some scary dust and water damaged panels in parts of the multi-layered ceiling. We asked the hostess what it had been before  and she said it had been a bank in the 70's. I managed to stop myself from quipping, "Well you can bank on us not returning."

Imagine you seasoned a big roast and cooked it in your oven for hours, cooled it down, and then sliced it. This is the roast beef from Midwestern Meats. No joke- I have not once purchased roast beef from a grocery or deli since I tasted Midwestern's. I was in Mesa today, and couldn't help but swing by.  The place is divided into three areas: a butcher shop, a bakery, and a restaurant. The restaurant is VERY inexpensive and serves the Midwestern comfort food fare you might imagine, in a very homespun environment. The bakery is hit or miss for me, but I absolutely love their coconut cream pies. They have breads, pastries, cookies, cupcakes, coffee cakes, pies, ice cream, etc. The butcher shop has really good meat they ship in from Iowa. Chops and steaks, cut right in front of you, to your specification, plus ground meats, sausages, fresh gourmet burgers, ready for your grill- you name it, they probably have it.  I picked up some pork chops today and they were beautiful- super fresh, hand trimmed, and cut just as I asked for my next State Fair cooking contest.  Everyone who works here is ridiculously -and honestly- nice. For those transplants from the Midwest who miss its particular charms, this is your Mecca.

I know, I know. It's Red Lobster. It's been at least 10 years since I set foot in one. But Hubby and I watch the Food Network, and on Sunday we saw Kelsey win the Fresh Fish Challenge on the Next Food Network Star. It was an odd sounding dish- Macadamia Tilapia with White Chocolate Beurre Blanc- and Hubby decided he had to try it. So I got a couple of gift cards using my AmEx points (so if it was awful, at least we weren't paying for it).  Hubby's Advice to Yelpers: "Get over your disdain for chains and do not miss this dish. Kelsey is some kind of bizarre genius." And I have to agree. I never would have thought this would be good, but it totally works. The tilapia was perfectly cooked, crusted with a generous amount of toasted macadamia nuts, and sitting in a pool of beurre blanc with a light taste of white chocolate. For Top Chef fans, this was NOT anything like Dale's butterscotch scallops. It was subtle and unexpectedly amazing.  My dinner was fine. I had the honey and citrus glazed grilled skewers of shrimp and scallops. The scallops were overdone, but the shrimp were cooked well and the glaze was a really nice complement to them.   Conclusion: Go for the Kelsey special. It's the real deal.

I really enjoy comedy, but don't have the budget to see every big comedian who can fill the Dodge Theatre. And I am boycotting the Improv due to their horrifying and shady business practices. So, until the UYE at the Comedy Spot, I thought it would be a very long time between fixes. I can envision coming here often. It was an open mic night, but far more of the comics were funny than not, and how can you beat $10 tickets? The drink service was fast and friendly, all the seating was intimate (in a good way), and the rest of the staff was friendly and welcoming. I'm already looking forward to returning!

Hubby and I were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) meeting and lecture. I know. In a bar. Called "Pranksters Too." The speaker, who had come in from California, was amused by it as well.   That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu (someone at our table likened it to the Cheesecake Factory) which included salads, fried apps, burgers, sandwiches, croissants, pizza-pan sized heaps of nachos, soup, and quesadillas.   We shared a zucchini and mushroom appetizer which was breaded (in-house, I believe) with something light, crispy, and nicely seasoned. They did not taste greasy at all. I had a delicious and perfectly cooked sourdough burger and Hubby had a croissant sandwich which could have been better (the croissant was not crisp and flaky and he could not taste the avocado very well).   The service was very good for as chaotic and packed as the group made it. Let alone all the styro containers of coral frags that people had all over the tables to show and sell. It's like a drug smorgasbord, and there are deals being made at every table. I'm telling you, unless you are DINKs, I don't recommend getting started in this hobby...   But I digress. Pranksters Too is a large venue with friendly staff that handled our group very well. We'll be back for sure.

Now that I have moved away from my Walgreens of the last 5 years or so, I can really appreciate the true superiority of this location. Let me 'splain:  1. This location is open 24 hours. When I need whatever anyone needs from Walgreens at 4:00 in the morning, I can have it. I now pass by three Walgreens on the way to my new job, and not one is 24 hours. WTF? I am an early commuter, and sometimes I need things early. Damn you, Scottsdale Walgreens!  2. Not once has this location EVER screwed up my or my husband's prescriptions. Avoid the Thomas Rd location near Home Depot. I swear it is always full of trainees and just a hot mess all the time. Even the 7th St. at McDowell location we now use has its share of dingbats. Not so at the perfect Tempe pharmacy.  3. I have never experienced or witnessed rude or inappropriate behavior from the employees at this location. Let's just say that the ones nearer my home are ghetto-fabulous.   4. This store is always clean, bright, and well-stocked. I have never once felt unsafe or unsanitary shopping here, as I have at other Walgreens.  Oh, Glorious Southern & McClintock Walgreens! How I miss you! You are my only regret in changing jobs.

Sweet merciful Jebus. I will never go to the Tempe Improv again. I used to go years ago, and always had a good time. I have been twice now in the last couple of months, the last time- and I do mean the LAST time- was last night for the taping of "Last Comic Standing". The management needs a serious and swift kick in the rear. The impression we were all left with is that they truly did not give a damn that we were left to stand outside for up to 2-1/2 hours later than what we were told, that we were just plain lucky that we got even one drink, and that the food we ordered- well, it just wasn't coming in the end. But who gives a crap? It's just their customers. Apparently we are all replaceable. A comedian who came up on stage to entertain while the judges and producers were debating the semi-finalists, gave some non-sensical explanation about how the "rules had changed" and that they had in fact made the food we ordered, but the staff got to "gorge themselves" on it in the back. They then had the audacity to ask us to pay for our drinks. The same comedian made reference to the Improv "making it up to us" somehow, but nothing came. Nothing except glasses of nasty tap water at the 11th hour. Oh- THAT was my comp for a miserable evening, starving and dehydrating? Gee, guess I should be grateful. Two stars for Bill Bellamy who was very funny, two of the wanna-be's who made me pee my pants a little, and getting to see Kathy Najimy and Fred Willard. Negative stars to the Improv itself for creating an atmosphere of discontent, hostility, and degradation.

There's a lot we like about Rula Bula. Hubby adores the Boxty selections, and even gets a little miffed when other Irish places do not serve them. Last time we went, we decided to try items we had not had before, so we opted to share the Fisherman's Platter (with 4 shrimp, 2 pieces of fish, and 1 scallop and chips) and the Irish Mac & Cheese with Rashers (bacon pieces). The Mac was not as stellar as I hoped, but that didn't stop us from finishing the dish. It needed a bit more seasoning, I think. The Platter was good, but the standout for us both was the chips- 1/4 inch slabs of potato cooked to perfection and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The coleslaw was also the way I like it-crispy, and not too sweet. The meal also came with two types of Irish soda bread and a side salad, which made a very nice lunch the next day, as we were completely stuffed from the dishes we shared. Service was attentive, and the prices are fair. We'll be back for the boxty, for sure.

Hubby has been eating mostly vegetarian lately, so we decided to check out Green. I don't think we'll go back.   Everything we ate, we could get better elsewhere. Hubby's pad-thai-ish dish was pretty good, with noodles, a zippy sauce, and big crunchy veggies. All of which makes the nastiness of the egg(less) rolls even more inexplicable. They were positively mushy inside, and had both hot and cold spots. Maybe it's just me, but I like some texture and identifiable ingredients in my egg rolls. They were also weirdly spiced and arrived without the dipping sauce advertised in the menu. The busser admitted they were made ahead of time, which certainly doesn't help matters. He didn't seem to care that we thought they were bad- he just shrugged and said, "Well SOME people don't like them." Well, I guess we're SOME people then. We also tried the much praised pseudo crab puffs, and they were pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce that managed to come out with this plate. Hubby also had to have the soy "blizzard". He liked it, and I thought the taste was fine initially, but then had an aftertaste I didn't care for.   The atmosphere is clearly meant for hipster youngsters. The lighting was so low that I literally had a hard time reading the white on black menu. Seriously, Green. Have some consideration for your clientele over 20.   The last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff. As we finished our meal, they were starting to close. Hubby went up to the counter to order his soy "blizzard" and the too-cool-for-the-rest-of-us young man behind the counter had to ask a co-worker if they were still making them. Um, if you still have customers in the restaurant, I would imagine you should still be making them. It's not like we were in there for a half hour past closing, and there were still many customers in the place.   One last observation: what's up with all the vegetarian and vegan smokers clogging the entrance? God forbid there be any animal products in your bodies, but bring on the tar and chemicals!?! As someone who quit smoking after many years, I would appreciate it if Green would insist that their customers observe the keep-it-20-feet-from-the-entrance ordinance.

Was About the Reef the most pristine aquarium store I have been to? No, that would be Aqua Touch. But About the Reef has a number of things going for it.   First, they have a more interesting selection of fish than I have seen at most Valley stores, and the prices seem to be quite good. They did not have much live rock when we went today, but they did have some premium pieces with "bonus" corals on them. They have a decent selection of books and magazines, tanks (with lots of custom options), chemical kits, and refrigerated and frozen food. The most impressive of their corals were not for sale, unfortunately, but they had a decent variety of smaller ones.   One of the best things About the Reef has going for it is service. Chris was fantastic, and was able to answer everyone's questions in detail about every aspect of reef tanks. It's clear this young man is a professional, not a college kid or casual hobbyist. He also gave me great information about how to save my beloved "special needs" crab Olive, who has cartoonish pop-eyes and a missing claw. We will definitely be returning to About the Reef soon.

Hubby and I had been to Monti's once before together, so when I suggested it for tonight's pre-theatre dinner, he wasn't all that thrilled. I convinced him with the gift certificate I had received from a student.   Let's just say more than a few things changed his mind about Monti's. In fact, he couldn't even remember what he had gotten before, but he was sure it wasn't the beef. We both enjoyed the heck out of the Roman Bread, and he marveled that it was fluffy, unlike most focaccia. He then ordered the clam chowder (house made- we asked!) which was the creamiest I had ever had, with zero grit and wonderfully tender potatoes and clams. Hubby said he'd rarely had better, and it was a challenge for me to get more than one spoonful from him. The house salad was kind of lame- your basic iceberg affair- and the fried zucchini appetizer was pretty mediocre.  For our entrees, I had the 8 oz prime rib and he had the 9 oz filet mignon, both medium rare. And that, my friends, is how they arrived. Getting rare or medium rare done correctly is not easy, we have found, either through cook incompetence or nervous nelly-ness of the restaurant. My baked potato and his lightly garlicked mashed were both excellent, but we found the vegetable mix of green beans, yellow carrots, broccoli, and red bell pepper to be flavorful, but soggier than we care for.   We were very full, but decided to get the peach cobbler and coffee for dessert. Let's just say that right after we got the cobbler, a couple of guys walked by our table. One said to the other, "Did you see that pie? Let's order dessert first!" It was HUGE, topped with whipped cream, accompanied by two scoops of a delicious cinnamon ribboned ice cream, and very, very yummy. The coffee was pretty smooth and had a very nice flavor.   Our server was attentive and very speedy. We'll be back to Monti's for sure. Oh, and by the way, it was already crowded at 5:00. Call ahead for reservations.

Hubby and I ate at Craftsteak recently for our anniversary dinner for 2 reasons: I am a serious carnivore, and we both are big fans of Top Chef.  The decor was interesting, but there were parts of the restaurant that were just too dark. I was glad we were seated in a better lighted main dining room. The service was stellar the entire night.  For an appetizer we had the Hawaiian prawns, which were good, but maybe a tad salty and chewy for my taste. The cured meat platter was a huge hit with my husband. It had about 4 varieties of salamis and prosciutto along with soft pretzel mini-baguettes. The purple peppercorn dipping sauce was amazing, with a very complex flavor.  For his entree, Hubby had the Kobe flat iron steak, which he really liked, but to me, it wasn't that great- maybe he had it too rare for my taste. I had the rib-eye, which had a slightly sweet crust that was a bit too blackened  in parts. The meat itself was perfectly cooked (medium-rare), and was delicious over all. It was far too much for one person. As side dishes, we had the Yukon gold puree (delicious) and a mushroom mix (not on the menu but offered by our waitress). The hen-of-the-woods was our favorite by far. I will definitely get just that next time- the other mushrooms were fine, but not outstanding like the hen.  For dessert, we tried the ice cream & sorbet sampler. There were 6 reasonably sized scoops: chocolate (good), peanut butter (outstanding), caramel (OK), melon (great if you like cantaloupe), coconut (good), and strawberry (outstanding).  All in all, with a great tip, and one cocktail apiece, the damage was $260.

I was almost tempted to give 5 stars, just for the glazed bacon alone, sliced from a slab of which I have never seen an equal. Hubby and I are now forever spoiled. Oscar Meyer, we spit on you.   The rest of the Wynn Sunday Brunch was mostly good, with a few distinct low points.  The good: the eggs benedict, sushi, chilled shrimp, yogurt (very fresh tasting- no gelatin there!), prime rib, crusty french rolls, and the dark chocolate mini tarts with a piece of gold leaf on top.  The seriously questionable: fried chicken (the chef is a pepper monkey), the smoked trout (SO very fishy tasting), and most of the other desserts. Now, I used to be a pastry and bread baker for a restaurant and catering company, so you can trust my palate. The "vanilla" cupcake was the worst offense, with a strange taste and weird crumb, and to top it all off, a piped swirl of butter. No, not butter-cream, like you would expect. It was whipped butter, with maybe a teaspoon or two of powdered sugar in it.   The service was attentive, and the seating was such that you did not feel like you were in a cafeteria.  Worth the price? For the bacon alone, yes.

Note to self: ALWAYS listen to Amanda B.  I spent a few hours at Drip recently, needing to get away from the Hubby, who is on a real vacation, not a working "vacation" as this teacher always is. Damned evaluations...  Anyway, Drip was pretty full when I arrived at 11:00, and remained fairly so until I left 3 hours later. The iced latte I had might just leave me with a bleeding ulcer, but on the other hand, the cucumber, havarti, spinach, and cream cheese sandwich I had was freaking awesome.   The atmosphere was pretty industrial, with an awkward second room which also contained the single unisex bathroom with a separate sink just outside the enclosed stall. Really, Drip. This feels like one small step above a porta-potty. The chairs were not entirely uncomfortable, but just enough so that it kept me working. No squishy nappy-time seats here, except for one boxy couch. I suppose that's good. But sorry, Drip. Pair the whole experience with your lame hours and poor acoustics, and I can't see myself returning.

We're a little conflicted about Rosie's. We've been quite a few times, and usually have an excellent meal here. The service in the last few months has been not so good. That said, our waitress last week filled us in on the recent menu scuttlebutt. We had been told, to our great dismay, earlier this summer that a number of our favorite menu items, including the boxty, would soon be gone. However, certain chef issues have been dealt with now, and almost all of the menu will remain the same.   Good thing, too, because Hubby's beef, potato, mushroom & dark beer boxty was out of this world. My go-to dish of fish & chips was delicious as always. The hot pretzel app also hit the spot, with two great dipping sauces- the grainy mustard and the fabulous curry.   Parking is hellacious, as always, and we never go on weekends anymore, but we do love Rosie's as a weekday night dinner option. We've just learned to lower our expectations when it comes to the service. After all, they are keeping our boxtys, and well, we're simply not as interesting as the frat boys to our waitresses. We've accepted this.

I first learned about Tammie Coe when at a Holiday party, no one but me dared to cut into a cake they thought was a decoration (her Santa's Sack). When I asked the hostess, she told me that Tammie was now the hottest cake designer in town, having replaced Cathy (of Rum Cake fame). Newly engaged, I knew I had to check her out for my wedding cake. Since my (now) husband and I both are public servants, we had to be creative in order to afford what turned out to be the culinary hit of the wedding. Instead of a stacked cake, we bought plant stands of varying height from Home Depot and then ordered a variety of large single cakes from Tammie who wrapped them in her signature fondant all in the same way. I picked them up myself and took them to the wedding location, and in this way I saved about half the cost of a traditional wedding cake. The individual cakes looked amazing set up on an oblong table, and everyone said they were the best cakes they'd ever had.   I must say, however, that these days, I stop by the Roosevelt location most often for her husband's bread. Those crusty delicious loves are truly cravable.

Of course I still love Tammie's cakes and cupcakes and cookies. And her husband's bread is still my local favorite. But I just discovered this week a new reason to love Tammie Coe: the boxed lunches.  For around $10 each, I ordered lunches for my fellow faculty members who were having an in-service at the Phoenix Art Museum. There were about 10 different sandwiches to choose from, and about 4 salads, and they all came with a drink, chips, and giant cookie. Everyone raved, and many asked me from where I had gotten lunch. The salads were huge and the sandwiches were hearty and very satisfying. Everything was clearly labeled, and packed into individual brown bags for each person. I could make special requests like "no nuts in the cookie" and the woman in  charge, Sia, was a pleasure to work with. I felt that I got a great value for my group, and will absolutely use Tammie Coe again for my smaller catering needs.

Eden's Veggie Patties might just make me join Hubby in his vegetarian diet. They were simply outstanding- a mix of cauliflower, potato, parsley and spices fried to crispy perfection. I had the gyros, which were good, but not really much different from gyros I have had many places before. I was doubtful of the rice at first- saffron, cinnamon, toasted almonds and golden raisins- but it all worked. The hummus was heavy on the tahini and super creamy. I think I would prefer a touch more lemon and garlic. If the veggie patty was so outstanding, I can't wait to go back and see how well Eden's does falafel.

Hubby and I tried Fogo last night for my birthday. For the money, I would rather have gone to a place like Circa 1900. The salad bar was at least not a typical Sweet Tomatoes-esque affair, with egg, potato, shrimp and chicken (and many more) salads, potato lasagna, marinated mushrooms, King crab legs, and crab rangoons. Then the meats started coming fast and furious. The turkey was clearly processed, the chicken drumstick was over-seasoned and dry, the filet mignon was over-cooked and tasted like organ meat, the pork loin was quite dry, and the sausage was tough and gristle-y. My favorite was the sirloin by far. Hubby enjoyed it all more than I did, even though I am usually the bigger carnivore. The service was good, except they were constantly trying to up-sell with drinks ($7 a piece) and dessert which were not included in the $29.95 basic meal. I got a hat on my head and a ball of fudge with a candle in it for my birthday dessert. The grand total, with an appropriate tip, was $95- not worth the indigestion for the rest of the night. You can do much better than Fogo for a special night out.

I think I was transported back to my early childhood the first time I had one of Old Heidelberg's Kaiser rolls. I may have even gotten a little misty-eyed. It tasted JUST like the ones I used to go and get from the bakery every morning with my Oma during the summers I spent in Bavaria.  I still get a little giddy every time I walk in and discover something new or rediscover an old favorite. Take the Erdnuss Flips for example- they are like puffed Cheetos, but peanut butter flavored. It takes a moment to adjust to a texture you associate with cheese, but with the "wrong" taste. But once you get over that- boy, have you ever set yourself on the path to addiction.   It is truly bizarre to me that the Christmas chocolates currently in stock have exactly the same wrappers they did 30+ years ago. I used to pride myself on my unsentimentality, and scoffed at tradition. Now look at me...  Besides the Kaiser rolls, the rye bread (yea! no seeds!) and the soft pretzels are fantastic. There is usually a small selection of pastries, and a widely varying selection of jams, other canned and jarred items, candy, toiletry items (the German Nivea cream is different and better-of course!- than the Nivea cream commonly sold in the States), mixes (such as potato dumpling), baking powders, gravies, cookies, and noodles. They also have a refrigerated case with some lunch meats and sausages, usually some imported butter (so worth the price) and occasionally some cheeses. Sometimes they do run low, but they explained to me once that they are often at the whim of their suppliers.  They are closed Sundays and Mondays. Both of the women I have seen working there are helpful and friendly.

Had lunch with the girls from work here today and it was delicious! I had a burrito with carne asada and all the fixin's just like I like it. It's like Subway in that respect, but edible, or Chipotle, but less rigid somehow. The chips and queso were alright and the iced tea was STRONG and tasty.   The patrons were, shall we say, eclectic: from the unusual man in a business suit who danced his way out the door to "Kokomo" (which was playing at the time) to the grey skinned and skeletal heroin addict who combed the garbage in full sight of everyone. Eeeeep. Ah well, final memories of Tempe as I not so tearfully change jobs. Hello, NoSco...

In the 11 years I have worked in this part of Tempe, I have seen quite a few restaurants in the current location of Cafe Wasabi. In fact, I only knew it was there when I invited a former student of mine to lunch and this was her suggestion. My husband and I have been perpetually disgusted by the quality of the seafood in the valley, with the notable exception of PF Chang's scallops. The freshness of this sushi was impressive and is far, far better than the fancy sushi places in town like Ra. The rolls are not only delicious, but absolutely beautiful- they look just like the pictures. Prices were reasonable for the quality, and the place was impeccably clean, with a slightly modern, industrial feel. I will be back for lunch for sure and will make a special trip from CenPho with hubby.

My husband has been wanting to go here for awhile now. He had frequented the Houston store when he lived there, and I had made him throw out his ancient dregs of Penzey's taco seasoning when he moved in.   I expected Penzey's to be FAR more expensive than it is. Many items are less than you would pay for McCormick's in the grocery stores. They sell just about any spice, dried herb, and combo seasoning that you could think of, in a good variety of sizes. They also have cocoa powder, 3 different vanilla strengths, almond, lemon, and orange extracts, whole vanilla beans, arrowroot, and cream of tartar for the bakers. They have sample jars of everything, so you can get a close look at the texture and get a good whiff as well. It's all very high quality.   They have recipe books, customizable gift packs, and very helpful staff. If you are a Food Network junkie like we are, this is where you can get all the "new" hot seasonings all the cool kids are using.

When I read the positive reviews of Tradiciones on Yelp and in the papers, I can't help but wonder why it is that my husband and I have had such different experiences. We've been twice; once the service was barely acceptable and once the service was the worst I have ever had in my life. God only knows why we gave it a second chance. The waitress barely acknowledged us and then completely disappeared midway through our meal. We tried in vain to get the attention of several others, including a manager, to get our check. We ended up waiting at least half an hour, and that was after my husband got up and convinced someone to give a &^%@#.  We both left with the distinct feeling that if we were Hispanic, this would not have happened. The food was average: decent chips, good spice level, greasy cheese.

This may just be our new favorite Mexican restaurant! Hubby and I were seated immediately, got drinks and chips right away, and settled in to look at the large menu. Hubby immediately saw the Pollo Fundido and when I told him a fellow Yelper had recommended it (thanks, Alexander!) he was done looking. Indeed, he was not steered wrong- it was an absolutely delicious combination of tender and moist chicken mixed with seasonings and topped with cream cheese and melted cheddar. I love carnitas, and so decided to give theirs a try. Holy wow- so well seasoned and savory and yet magically, you could still really taste the pork. Super tender, as well- it must have been cooked for many many hours. The beans that came on both of our molten hot plates were really good. I like it when there is actual texture to refried beans rather than a puree, and these were chunky and flavorful with melted cheese on top. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican rice, but this at least had pieces of vegetable in it and a good flavor.  We got a fried ice cream to share (thanks, Julie!) and it was huge and delicious, topped with strawberries and whipped cream. The service was warm, friendly and attentive- like being taken care of by an aunt. To top it all off, and what tipped my rating from 4 to 5 stars, was the price- $32 for two hearty entrees, beer, sodas, and dessert?!? Easily one of the best values in a quality sit-down restaurant we've had in a long time. Garcia's is going in our regular rotation.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the only place to go in the Valley for good looking, comfortable shoes at a fair price when you have hard to fit feet. I have been shopping here for over a decade, and the customer service has always been outstanding. Not only am I a teacher, but I also have MS, so wearing bad shoes during the day can mean an evening of excruciating pain. Whenever I wear shoes I got at Otherwides, I can be guaranteed a more comfortable day and decreased need for pain management at night. Don't forget to check the back room for clearance deals!

In an area of failing and closing restaurants El Gran Taquito is another fail. We had high hopes walking in yesterday as the place was packed with cops and they often know what's a good hole in the wall.   I had the combo #1- both the pork and beef were dried out and well below proper temperature. The rice had zero flavor and the beans were grey. My husband had the chile relleno which he declared greasy but pretty good. I think his standards have already plummeted in the two weeks we have lived in the culinary wasteland that is Laveen.  Within half an hour of returning home, I was suffering digestive distress. It looks like we'll have to start cooking for ourselves again.

I normally enjoy Pita Jungle, but this was our first visit to this location. I don't think we'll return. The Spanakopita was barely warm, and I had to double check that they actually used fillo dough. It certainly didn't look like it at first glance, and it did not have much of a flaky crunch. It absolutely was not worth nearly $4 for a very modest halved triangle. My sirloin with hummus was simply not appetizing- the two flavors did not  marry well to my taste, and the meat was too overdone (and I was not given an option to have it rarer). The chicken with hummus and pine nuts is far superior and a dish I have enjoyed many times before. Hubby enjoyed his falafel pita well enough. His only complaint was that there was not enough tzatsiki sauce. I thought the falafel was overly crunchy and too dry on the inside, but then again, I am super picky about falafel, having spent a summer in Ann Arbor years ago, learning Arabic and eating outstanding Middle Eastern food.   The service was OK, not particularly friendly, but efficient. I think this location can take a lesson or two from the East valley locations.

This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria. We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities. We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond. There is even a Starbuck's.  We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before. It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement "bar" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement "tables" behind on which to do prep work. There were also sinks in the center to wash up. Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group. What a fantastic set up!   Great job, Peoria!

This is the theatre that Hubby and I discovered by accident more than 2 years ago and went to several times when we lived in Mesa. It seemed to be the only thing open in the shopping plaza at Dobson and the 202 at the time. We were impressed by Cinemark- everything was clean (it had better- it was so new), the prices were better than Harkins and AMC, the seats were comfortable and the AC was low.   I went back for the first time since we moved to CenPho today with Julia T., and I was glad to see that almost nothing had changed from my first impression. It was still clean, the staff was super friendly, the AC was far better than in the last 2 theatres I attended, and the prices were still a little lower than the bigger chains around here. There were even kids in the theatre with us and we didn't hear a peep from them or get our chairs kicked- imagine! I went home and told Hubby that this is where we're headed as often as possible to see movies from now on.   I hope Cinemark makes it, actually. The shopping center is a ghost-town compared with the Tempe Marketplace, and many stores have yet to open.

What I thought would have been a very nice and romantic Valentine's Day dinner at the Four Seasons resort Crescent Moon restaurant turned out to be a stunning disappointment.   First of all, we were seated outside- twice. The staff member who brought us out there took us immediately back in because he thought the hostess had made a mistake. But no, the mistake was his, so back out we went. Did I mention there was a light drizzle outside? Fortunately, we were flanked by two heaters so searing I wondered if I would have to reach for the Solarcaine when I got home.   We got menus right away, but waited quite a while even for some water. When our waitress took our order for food, she did not even ask if we wanted drinks, even though my husband was holding the wine list open in his hands. When I asked for a gin, she did not bother to ask my husband if he cared for anything. When I got my gin, my glass was chipped. She apologized and brought me another. Unfortunately for all of us, this turned out to be only her first apology of the night.  We got a basket of breads which were just ok- some may have even been a bit on the tough side. Then a waiter came over and tried to give us entrees that were not ours, and we had not even had the first course of their special Valentine's Day menu. At last our sweet corn cream soup arrived, with a strip of poblano and a goat cheese empanada floating in it. Hubby liked it better than I did, but I do not care much for sweets at dinner. It was pretty good for what it was.   Our entrees consisted of a petite filet, some king crab leg meat (out of the shell), and Yorkshire pudding with creamed spinach on top. We both ordered our beef medium rare, but what we got was overdone on one side and rare on the other. The crab was nearly inedible- it tasted like it had been previously frozen, and was totally overdone and chewy. Having just spent Christmas on the gulf coast catching and eating crab, we know what fresh tastes like and this was NOT it. When the waitress came to check on us and Hubby commented on the crab, she offered to bring us a new plate of it. We declined, not trusting they could get it right. We also had to let her know that steak knives would have been nice for our steak. The pudding and spinach were decent.  The dessert was the stand-out of the whole dinner: a small scoop of very dark chocolate ice cream (house made), a coconut cake (really more like a big soft cookie) topped with a layer of firm chocolate and then with a circle of flan. The presentation was nice and the small drops of super fresh caramel sauce as decor were so delicious that I would have purchased a jar to take home. Props to the pastry chef. However, I had to ask for coffee and cream, and then she did not bring sugar. How freaking specific do I have to be? It was just the tip of the iceberg in a night of thoughtless service.   The first reviewer commented that the "service was good- but you cannot expect less-- it's the Four Seasons!" I would have expected this to be true, but left completely astonished that the staff was so poorly managed or trained that we had to ask for beverages and proper utensils, that our menus were left on the table until the first course arrived, that the bread and butter were still on the table as we left, that I was served my drink in a chipped glass, and that we were seated outside when it was drizzling. Let alone the decidedly mediocre food- as DINKs, we do not mind spending $150 on a good meal. But when we left wishing we'd gone to Arriba, that's a problem. Oh- and my last impression? No soap in the ladies' room.  UPDATE: I wrote to corporate- something I almost never do. I got a very quick response, and then a few days later another from the local food manager who offered to comp us a meal. Not being the type to complain just in order to get free stuff, I declined. I figured that if I were in charge, I sure as hell would want to know if food, service, and housekeeping were far below the standard that my "brand" suggested.

Now that a week has gone by, I feel I can write this review and not become unhinged. My beloved cat Pepper, who was my constant companion for the last 2 years, spent last weekend at this Emergency Animal Clinic. Our regular vet told us to bring him here as it was the 24-hour animal hospital closest to our home. It turned out he had a very serious bladder stone condition, and come Monday, when we were able to see our regular vet, we made the heart-breaking decision that putting him down was the best thing to do.   However, if the staff at this EAC had managed to give us all the information they had, we might have been able to save Pepper a lot of pain and misery sooner and maybe us hundreds if not thousands of dollars. First of all, this place is ghetto. Nothing about the appearance and upkeep inspires any confidence. Secondly, they have rotating doctors and technicians, so you are always talking to someone new. And everyone has a different opinion, and most of them were inconsistent with what our vet told us in the end. The reception area staff was unprofessional. The first girl we spoke to stammered over how to ask when Pepper had last urinated or defecated. Um... how about learning and using appropriate terminology? The person entering my information transposed 2 of the numbers of my cell phone number. No wonder they had to call my husband instead. I verbally corrected it with them over the phone, but when we went in later that day, they still had not changed it on Pepper's  paperwork, so we took out a pen and fixed it ourselves. They neglected to call us when Pepper's urethra blocked yet again within the first 12 hours. They neglected to call us when his temperature spiked again and he became agitated. They said they told my husband the results of his blood tests over the phone, but he does not recall hearing that information. They did let us come see him several times, and while we were waiting to be led back to the cages, we were regaled with loud and stupid personal conversations, that apparently the staff did not care that the rest of us in the waiting room could hear. It just pissed me off that we were all in life-and-death situations and they were all into their petty gossiping. Not that I expect a medical practice to be a somber graveyard, but appropriate conversation at an appropriate volume would simply show respect for the clientele.   When I told my boss, a fellow cat lover and downtown resident, what happened, she said that she too had once taken a cat to this EAC in an emergency. It was having severe upper respiratory problems, and they were having some trouble getting it out of its carrier. So instead of getting my boss to see if she could coax it out, they tied a rope around its neck. Around the neck of a cat who couldn't breathe. She took the cat somewhere else immediately.  I will also never go here again in an emergency, and have since spoken to a number of people who have given me other options should I find myself in need of immediate after hours care. Our bill (which had to be pre-paid, mind you) was nearly $2000. Outrageous indeed.

Thanks to Beth G.'s review today we remembered that we'd been here once before and liked it, so we returned for dinner tonight.   I had a California steakburger. What makes it "California"? Classic burger veggies? Strange. It was tasty, though. The beef was well-seasoned and crispy on the thin outer edges. Yummy. Hubby had the patty melt on another Yelper's recommendation, but he found the heavily seeded rye "distracting." Both came with a vat of shoestring fries. Delicious and crispy, but frankly, way too much.  We both got some custard- we drove 20 miles to get here, so we might as well. I had a regular sized Hawaiian sundae and Hubby had a vanilla custard with peanut butter mix-in. Very smooth and peanut-buttery. Mine was also tasty, but huge- I would hate to see the large.  We'll make the trek to Freddy's again- there are so few places around here that are even close to Steak-n-Shake (Midwest fave).

So, the tow truck guy who jumped my car on a recent Sunday told me my battery was bad, and suggested I go to Auto Zone, since they would install it for free. He even told me to go to this location.   Genesis helped me get the right battery with an amazing warranty (turns out the last one that had been installed in my car was substandard), deftly removed my dying one and installed the new one. She chatted with me about cars while she did so, and let me know that Fords are notorious for having easily corrosive battery connectors. She applied a salve to the connectors to help preserve them and then gave me the rest of the packet so I could apply more later, especially in the summer months. Her customer service skills were great- just being around a young woman who clearly knows what she's doing with cars was actually inspirational. I normally play the dumb, helpless girl who needs a boy to help her with anything automotive. Genesis made being a car chick cool. I will definitely return to this Auto Zone location, and hope to work with Genesis again.   I did try to tip Genesis for her time and labor, but she refused, saying she would rather have me as a repeat customer, but if I wanted to say something nice on-line, I could do that. Here you go, Genesis. Here's hoping your boss sees this and gets confirmation of what a stellar representative of the business you are!

We tried T-Bone recently after a desperate search for something decent to eat in our neck of the woods and we really enjoyed it. It was not very busy for a Saturday night, but that's Phoenix during the summer for you. This is when we locals get to take back our resorts and restaurants from the conventioneers and snowbirds.   Other reviewers are right on the money regarding the mediocre at best sides, and the outstanding steaks. Mesquite grilled to perfection, my t-bone was fabulous, but my husband's New York strip was even better. The cowboy beans were also very good, with a nice zippy spice to them. The "salad bar" had an iceberg mix and a canned green bean and red onion salad. My baked potato was just fine and came with no shortage of butter and sour cream.   The biggest surprise of the evening was the beer- they have their own microbrewery. My husband ordered the stout which was delicious even though it was on the sweet side. I had the pale ale and it was great. Our server, who was awesome, told us that the amber was the best. We'll be trying that next time.   The whole atmosphere of T-Bone's is casual, friendly, and comfortable. We enjoyed the unique view of Phoenix lit up at night in front of us complete with silhouetted saguaros and South Mountain right behind us. I can see us becoming regulars here.

Having a hard time with cat groomers... I brought my cat into Hot Dogs and Cool Cats. First of all, the place is quite cluttered, and I was surprised that the counter was littered with the personal information cards of at least 10 clients. Secondly, I had been told that they do dogs in the morning and early afternoon, with cats in the mid-afternoon until close, giving me the impression that it would be a more comfortable environment for cats. Not true- dogs were being groomed before and after my cat's appointment, and several dogs were in kennels in the main grooming area. They did pay close attention to what my preferences are. However, thirdly, they nicked my cat's nipple while clipping her, and also left several bald patches on her sides. I can absolutely understand that animals can get scared and be unpredictable, and that nicks and slip-ups can happen. I would not be upset had they owned up to it. I didn't notice my cat's bloody nipple until I got home. No wonder I got some nervous, funny looks when I picked her up. It must have hurt- they HAD to have known.   Be honest, people. Your clients will be apt to forgive little mistakes if they feel you are truthful. Today, it's a nick. Tomorrow, would you not inform a client that you felt something that might be a tumor, for fear you might upset them?

The Phoenix Symphony Hall is right around the corner from the Washington and 3rd Street Metro Rail stop. What a nice alternative to the parking nightmare downtown can be sometimes, especially if there is more than one event going on. From the looks of the return crowd at the station, it seemed that plenty of people shared our enthusiasm for the new access to downtown culture.  Symphony Hall is a very nice venue, with huge hallways perfect for mingling, a couple of espresso bars, a gift counter, and good sized restrooms. The seats are fairly comfortable, with enough leg room that this 5'11" girl can actually stretch her legs all the way out. I have found the ushers and staff always friendly.  I've seen a number of concerts, special performances, and operas here over the years, and although I am grossly unqualified to judge the quality of the symphony itself, I have enjoyed most everything I have seen. I do like that they offer a wide variety of programs, from The Flying Dutchman to Bugs Bunny on Broadway, and make an effort to appeal to people of varying musical tastes.

The room and patio? Far better than average. The coffee and snax? Barfaroo. I met a student here yesterday to discuss her thesis, and there were only a few times our conversation was drowned out by the sound of the frap (or "frost") machine or the large party of burly bikers who came in. Hey, if Hell's Angel types think this place is cool enough for them, who am I to argue?   I ordered a black & white frost, which was advertised as a white and dark chocolate frozen mocha. I was horrified when the barista added milk to a cup of ice, and then a heaping scoop of some powder shit and threw it in the blender. It was foul. Hyper sweet and yet acrid all at the same time. The baklava? A soggy, nasty waste of phyllo dough. The other snack items didn't look appetizing at all: tightly wrapped muffins and clam-shelled chocolate cake and cheesecake- all from Costco.   If what goes inside their patrons could someday match their surroundings, we'd have a truly awesome coffee shop on our hands.

My husband and I frequent this AMC more than I care to admit...we see most of our movies here in the Arizona Center, and we almost always have a great experience. Once the ladies' room was a mess and once the concession stand was staffed *entirely* with young men who didn't give a shit. Oh, and the machines outside sometimes do not work as they should (we like to buy our tickets online). Wait... maybe I should knock them down a star- this is starting to add up. On the other hand, I LOVE the ticket takers just inside the doors. We always get either the super nice plump woman with short dark hair or the awesome and friendly short man with glasses. It's clear they were hired for their people skills. Get a movie watcher card- the bonuses add up pretty fast (free tickets, free snax, or discounts on snax). The  $5 tickets before noon on weekends and holidays are also hard to beat if movie prices are a concern. The theaters themselves are usually well cleaned, and the items from the concession stand are pretty fresh (nearly every time I have been to a Harkins, for the sake of comparison, the popcorn has tasted stale). Having Sam's Cafe, UNO, and now the great 1130 restaurant so close by, makes this AMC even more appealing and the Arizona Center a one-stop date night for us.

Hubby and I just waddled in from the Sunday Buffet at Ross's. We met the husband and wife owners who were both very charming, and sat down to some great soul food including:  *catfish (with a light cornmeal breading, these flash fried nuggets were simply the best I have ever had) *fried chicken (very well seasoned and delicious) *beef brisket (good flavor, could have been more tender, amazing BBQ sauce that tasted like a kicked up apple butter to me) *meatloaf (usually I am not a fan, but this was delicious, with very little filler) *seafood gumbo (decent, spicy, but too thin for Hubby's taste- he likes his file style) *mashed potatoes (boxed, but super smooth) *green beans (canned, salty and yummo, with a ham hock floating around in there) *spicy yellow rice with matchstick carrots (well flavored, beautiful dish) *cornbread (not sweet enough for Hubby, but I thought it was awesome) *collard greens (Hubby liked them, but for me, they are still an acquired taste) *potato salad (good, mustardy Southern staple with pickle and egg bits) *coleslaw (more vinegary than creamy, with pickle bits, definitely zingy and totally delicious) *hot wings and green salad (which neither of us tried) *peach cobbler (lemony with lots of cinnamon, it was awfully sweet, but still had warm bits of still crispy pie crust) *lemon pound cake (super moist- this was our favorite of the desserts)  With many more hits than misses, Ross's is a place we will go again for sure. The Sunday Buffet was a tad pricey at $16.99 each and $2.00 for a drink, but the atmosphere was bright and comfortable, and being able to choose among such a variety and have a little of just about everything made it worth it.

Seriously. What's the fuss over this place? Nostalgia? Because I was among the youngest patrons yesterday, and I'm pushing 40.   I met a new colleague here for a business lunch because he had just moved very close to Arrowhead. This location is right around the corner from the Mervyn's, with Macy's on the other side. It was mall food, not some awesome back-east deli. I had a roast beef. It had a decent amount of meat (but nowhere near the pic on their website), mayo, lettuce, tomato. I could have made this at home with better tasting unprocessed beef from Midwestern Meats. No option to toast the bread? I personally hate sandwiches on untoasted bread. The fries were nothing special. The wrapped cake slices were so smashed they were completely unappealing. How long have they been sitting there? The man behind the counter of the baked goods sub-section was rude and weird, but all the other staffers were pleasant. Last but not least, I felt the price was way too high. Almost $12 for a meh sandwich, fries, and a large drink? With no table service? No thanks, Miracle Mile.

After a traumatic day yesterday, I wasn't sure I wanted to make the trek from CenPho to Shea and 70th, but the plaintive look on Hubby's face made me give in- and I'm so glad it did. The place is in a strip mall, but is clean and bright and cheerful. We seated ourselves, and were given menus within minutes. Drinks followed shortly thereafter (they have an exceptional iced mint tea).   The menu is not huge, but there are many standard fare selections and some dishes I have never seen before, like the Jerusalem Meatballs that Hubby got. They were flavorful, in a tomato based sauce, with rice, vegetables, and a garbanzo bean salad. I had the falafel sandwich- three big falafel balls with tomato, lettuce, a pickle spear, and tahini tucked in a pita. It was good- better than I have had elsewhere in the valley, but still can't live up to the magical falafel I ate almost daily during the summer I took Arabic at the University of Michigan. I got a side order of fries, which were natural cut, and tasted fine, but were not exactly piping hot when I got them.  The hummus we had as an appetizer was some of the best I've ever had, with a pool of delicious extra tahini in the center. Not too garlicky, not too lemony- just very thick and creamy. The pita was just as I like it, too- very warm, and a great balance of chewy and crispy.  Having read in some reviews that the baklava was nothing to write home about, we decided to share the only other dessert they offer- a chocolate mousse they make on site. It was dark, with a good texture, and very rich. There would have been no way I would have been able to eat a whole one and not lapse into a diabetic coma afterward.  The place was quite busy, but not so busy that anyone who came through the door had to wait for a table. The service was attentive and friendly. One waiter, as we paid our bill (inexpensive, by the way- $30 for drinks, appetizer, 2 entrees, and dessert) said that this is the only restaurant he's ever worked in that he still wants to eat the food at the end of the night. Having spent many years in the restaurant/bakery business myself, that is high praise indeed.

Seriously, people. MBFGR is "Mediterranean" food capitalizing on a hokey movie that for some reason some people liked. There's a lot better to be had out there- try Pita Jungle, Flaming Kabob, or Byblos, for examples. I have also eaten once at the Mill avenue location and both places have been a testament to mediocrity-and that's being complimentary. Every server I have had here has been....well, let's just say "special"- or maybe stoned. The food served and what the menu describes are seldom the same. Please, I beg you, avoid this chain and get some real food at a local establishment crafted and served by people who know where Greece is.

Reading Amanda B.'s review reminded me of my own disastrous experience here recently. I have been to Seoul Garden three times. The first was really delicious- to the point I wondered how it had been that I had never had Korean before. I raved about it to my husband and we brought a friend there a couple of months later. It was still pretty good, but a definite decline from my first time.   The friend we brought suggested we all go there again when her grandparents were in town. To be blunt, I have never been so embarrassed by a restaurant in all my life. The waiter was clearly inexperienced and his English abilities were probably not what they should be, but the restaurant was not so busy that the service should have been THAT bad. We got our food in waves. He "forgot" the soup over and over again. I had to ask for silverware for the table so many times that I eventually got up and went to the back and got it myself. It was completely obvious that the Korean customers in the place got priority over our table of six Caucasians. I saw several tables get all of their food, finish, pay and leave before we even got half of our food. We never got refills on our drinks. It took forever for us to get proper plates and bowls. By the time two of us got our clay pot entrees, every one else had long finished their entrees. The food was edible, but again, a big step down from my first experience and we were all so pissed off that even if it had been the greatest food on the planet we wouldn't have known due to all the bitterness grown of frustration and annoyance. If anyone knows of a Korean restaurant that gives a shit about keeping customers, let me know.

Quite simply, this is the worst cupcake that has ever passed my lips. A student brought some in for his birthday this past week, and offered me and some of his other teachers one. I had the opportunity to try two flavors- a vanilla and a coconut-topped.   Both cake flavors were off- way off. The batter was not mixed well and had chunks of un-fully-incorporated ingredients in it. It was the heaviest cupcake I have ever had, and tasted as if it had been baked two weeks ago and recently thawed (that was part of the "off" flavor to me).   The frosting was one note: hella-sweet. I even overheard some kids complaining about it, and if that does not speak volumes, I don't know what would. The frosting was also exceedingly dense, and did not taste fresh. I normally love frosting and would never have complained about the copious amount on these cupcakes- if it had actually tasted even a little bit good.   I may be a harsher critic than some, as I used to bake professionally, but seriously, people, you'll get a better product and save yourself a ton of money if you go with Betty Crocker.

I am convinced that this is the best cab company in the valley. I have now used them twice. They are the only cab company who advertises in the yellow pages that you can book them in advance, which is perfect for when I am feeling especially anal about my travel going smoothly around the holidays. Both times they have been early to pick me and Hubby up, and they take--are you sitting down?-- the shortest route to the airport from my house, unlike the bastards you usually get stuck with who will take a leisurely tour before they get my ass where it needs to go.  Union Cab's cars are clean and the drivers are friendly. I did dock them a star because this last time I booked online, but after several hours had not received a confirmation phone call or e-mail. I then called, and it was clear they had not gotten my order. So, just call instead, and rest assured that you will be on time, driven by a nice person who will not screw you over.  UPDATE: We used Union Cab a third time at Christmas- they were still early (and this was at 4:30 am!), still friendly, and still reasonable. Somebody got a big fat tip.

I have vascillated on Mrs. White's for a few years now. Today's visit sealed the deal for me on why I won't return.   I got a to-go order of fried chicken, black eye peas and rice with gravy (since they were out of mac & cheese at 11:30 am). As I waited for my order, I watched several plates of chicken being delivered to customers eating in. The pieces were so huge they were half falling off the plates and towering above them. I looked forward to the same as I drove home, especially since I paid $14.81 for my lunch- and that did not include a beverage. Imagine my dismay as I opened my box at home and discovered three tiny pieces of underseasoned not-so-fresh tasting chicken. What the hell? You give the sit down customers the best you have to offer because they might complain otherwise? You give me some bullshit chicken because I am doing carryout? The peas were mush, the rice & gravy was bland, and the cornbread was overdone on the outside and heavy and underdone inside. I guess you're overcharging your customers to bank-roll your retirement, which will surely come sooner rather than later since I can't imagine how you're keeping customers.

No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.

Rachel was a no-show for our scheduled walk-through appointment which I had made weeks ago. I called three times within two hours after she was originally supposed to show up and she never answered nor returned my messages. Thank god I was able to get one of my students to pet-sit at the last minute, or else I would have had to cancel my trip. Pretty ghastly unprofessionalism. I guess she doesn't need the business.  UPDATE: I added a star because Rachel did eventually call- three hours after our scheduled appointment. She said she had a sick dog and "literally lost track of time." Now, I am not a heartless grinch. I understand being occupied with an ill animal. But for christ's sake- have a damn cell phone with you. It would "literally" have taken one minute to call me back and prevent me from becoming unglued.

I love this Super Target so much I am compelled to say its name in a sing-songy way. Suuuuuper Taaaar-get! Understand that this is not normal behavior for me.  I love this Super Target so much that I endured the light rail construction. Thank heaven it's pretty much done now. The Christown chaos pisses Hubby off so much he almost never goes with me. But that's ok- more time for me to poke around.  I love the awesome pet department. They even have the new styles of scratchers and corrugated chaise lounges as well as kitty clothes. Now if only I could get my monsters to wear the lobster hat...  I love the grocery store part. There are food items here I haven't seen outside of AJ's, and for a much more reasonable price! Their Archer Farms store brand is better than expected. Their fair trade coffee pods (for use in our Senseo machine) is simply the best coffee I have ever had.   I love that this store is so new and clean and well-organized. They even have people patrolling the parking lot in Segways.   Suck it, Walmart.

Where do I begin?   Let's start with the server who literally yelled everything he asked or said to us. Oh, and then he rammed a chair into my leg and was just not very concerned about our experience overall.  Let's move on to the cheese crisp, which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces, and virtually no "crisp." Did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it? 'Cause I could have done that at home.  Both drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like I like it, but not bitter. Hubby's lemonade was very good, but he drank it so fast I didn't get a chance to steal many sips.  Let's discuss the entrees, shall we? Hubby's carne adovada chimi was decent, better than my carnitas. In fact, MY carnitas is better. (I keep aiming for Chef Hector's at Sam's...) Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The "tortilla" was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake. Truly nasty.  As for the legendary salsas, Hubby found the green to be tasty, but he did not care for the flavor of the red. Neither was especially fiery to him either.   Riding on reputation, are we?

Louisiana born Hubby decided he wanted to go to Pappadeaux's for his birthday dinner after we discovered that Barrio Cafe would be closed Monday. The restaurant was unbelievably packed for a random Monday, but I was a tad annoyed that we still had to wait about a half hour to be seated- and that was with a reservation.   Our waitress was great and got Hubby's requisite Oyster, Crawfish, and Mushroom "Fondeaux" started right away. That kind of chain-y cutesy naming cheesiness makes me roll my eyes, but Hubby is blind to such lameness since Pappa's has a whole empire of similarly named restaurants in Texas (from where he moved to Arcosanti whence I snagged him- but I digress). He also ordered some kind of layered frozen fruity monstrosity that made him positively loopy (in his defense, we're not big drinkers).  After the Fondeaux appetizer, we barely had room for our entrees, so we both have excellent lunches today. I had a mixed seafood grill which had very nicely cooked pieces of scallop, mahi, and salmon together with way too well done shrimp. In apparently some sort of fugue state I also ordered a side of onion rings which I promptly regretted when the platter came out bigger than my head. They were mighty tasty, though, and I have not had much luck before finding really good onion rings (except at Ted's Hot Dogs, of course). Hubby ordered a crawfish platter with fried pieces and etoufee, but the waitress  convinced him to get the triple slam with blackened crawfish as well- and this turned out to be his favorite on the plate. All the portions are gargantuan, so we have to remember next time to share an entree, especially if we need to get the Fondeaux. Which I'm sure we will...

We really wanted to like Lucille's, really, we did. I married a Southern boy, so as I was reading the online menu to him, he decided he really wanted to go. Unfortunately for Lucille's, we've already been to Bobby Q's and Lucille's just does not stack up.  DRINKS: Hubby had an interesting dark beer made by Albita Ale in Louisiana (although our server mistakenly said it was from Mississippi) called Turbo Dog which had some rich coffee tones. I am not usually a dark beer drinker, but I liked it too. I had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint. It was sweet, but not LoLo's sweet (God love ya' LoLo's, but you're not exactly helping prevent the diabetes!) and that's a good thing.   APPETIZERS: Hubby just had to have him some fried okra. I tried two pieces to be a good sport, but the interior texture is something I just can't get over. He thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch. We were also served some biscuits (which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher) and some "apple butter" which was not really apple butter, but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon. Not impressive.  MEAT: Hubby had the brisket and I had the tri-tip. The brisket is so far superior at Bobby Q's in terms of tenderness. Lucille's wasn't awful, though, and the "mop sauce" which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table (original, Memphis, and Hot & Spicy) was really good, and I usually don't like BBQ sauces. My tri-tip was very smoky in flavor, but rather dry. I asked for it dry (meaning no sauce) and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the true test of good BBQ was having it sauce-less. And so I did. And Lucille's did not pass the test on the tri-tip.  SIDES: Hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious, and also the peanut slaw, which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil. It also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it, which made it inedible for me, but Hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he'd ever had.  I had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn was delicious, but I had no idea it would be on the cob. At Bobby Q's, they roast it, slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl, which I prefer. The mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve Southern food. I am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it. I have had better from a Kraft Deluxe box.  DESSERT: I am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the true standout. I have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can, so the homemade version at Lucille's was a treat. It had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving (more than enough for 2). It was topped with real whipped cream (not Redi-Whip).  SERVICE: The service was quite good, attentive but not annoying. A manager stopped by our table toward the end, and Hubby made a comparison between Lucille's and Bobby Q's. The manager said that a few other managers had come over from Bobby's to Lucille's, and implied that something was amiss at Bobby's in the overall running of the place. Whatever that is, it is not overt, as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby's. We decided that we'll give Lucille's 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs, and we'll return to try again. In the meantime, you'll see us at Bobby's.

Cheeburger Cheeburger in the Tempe Marketplace has only been open for two weeks and this showed in the nervousness of the staff and the slowness of the kitchen. That said, the food we got in the end was great for what it was- diner burgers.  You pick your burger size, from 5.5 oz (pre-cooked) through 20 oz, and if you finish the latter, you get your picture on the wall of fame. Hubby and I both had the 7 oz burger, which was plenty big. You choose your cheese, and then as many toppings as you want (which among your classics included salsa, chopped garlic, jalapeno poppers, sun dried tomatoes, pineapple, and tons of specialty sauces). Hubby asked for peanut butter on his burger, which was not among one of the named toppings, but was a shake flavor, and he got it. You can also choose toppings like bacon, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed onions, chili, or even a whole portobello for an additional charge. Our burgers were cooked to medium, just as we had requested, and were quite tasty.  We also split a basket of Frings, an onion ring and fry combo. The onion rings were among the best I've ever had, and Hubby called them "darn near perfect." They were thin and crispy, with a tempura-like batter. The fries are fresh cut and had good flavor- maybe some were a tad overdone and not as hot as they could have been.   I had their VanillaCola (made with syrup) which was good, and Hubby tried a shake with pistachio and macadamia which I thought would have been made with real nuts, but it seems to have been made only with syrup flavors. It was still good, and quite thick.  The decor was 50's diner, the wait staff all seemed like freshmen in college, and apparently there is a way to place your order ahead of time on-line. There are chicken and salad options as well. Our bill came to about $33 with tip. We'll probably try the other new places in the Tempe Marketplace before we return to Cheeburger, but we'll be back for sure.

I finally convinced Hubby to give Lucky Boy a try, based on all the rave reviews by trusted Yelpers. We almost didn't get out of the car, however, when we pulled into the back, only to see a group of apparent drug addicts huddled at the side of the Circle K. One woman (?) was alternately pounding a man in the chest, snapping back his head by means of his hair, and then spooning him. Ah, meth. You are truly a showman.  Anyway, when we decided to brave it, it was well worth the risk. The burgers were made from fresh, great quality beef, cooked to almost crispy on the outside, and yet still magically juicy on the inside. Fresh bun and toppings, and absolutely awesome fries. Super hot and wonderfully seasoned. I usually get some heartburn after eating fried foods, but had zero issues with Lucky Boy. We got some shakes to go- I had strawberry and Hubby had peanut butter. They were good, and very thick, but we both agreed that we prefer the more intense flavors of the shakes at the Chicago Hamburger Company.  Will we be back? You betcha. And not just for the "scared straight" factor.

Oh, Ice Tango... why do I love thee?  1. The small is freaking huge. I have a hard time imagining eating more.  2. The tart is surprisingly tart- and sooo very refreshing. What an awesome pick-me-up!  3. The fresh fruit additions are marvelous- my diced strawberries were so generously scooped into my cup that I had more strawberries than fro-yo at the end of my serving.  4. It is less than 3 miles from my new job. I may just make this a regular on-the-way-home treat. With so few calories involved, could you fault me?

Hubby and I had been excited a few weeks ago when it looked like the large restaurant space that had been closed forever in the corner of the Arizona Center near the Cold Stone and UNO was being occupied. It happened that when we went to the AMC this afternoon it was open, so we decided to check it out afterward.  The atmosphere was very inviting. They have lots of normal looking outdoor seating with heat lamps hanging above and then a very cool patio lounge area with boxy sofas and coffee tables, perfect for cocktails and appetizers. Inside, the decor was sparse but warm, lots of tans and brick, trac lighting, and an acoustic paneled ceiling.  The lighting was not obnoxiously dim as in some other trendy spots (what are they trying to hide, I always wonder), and there was a TV, but it was projected onto three large smoky glass divider panels and so could be viewed from the bar and from the dining room (but there, it was backwards). The music was at just the right level and ranged from R&B to Euro Pop.   1130 has a lot of steaks (choose your own cut and then from 5 prep methods), seafood items, and pasta. I am not a wine gal, so someone else will have to tell you if the selection is any good. They also had a short menu of specialty martinis and cocktails, and local (8th St) and import beer on tap.  We were seated and quickly given filtered water from a clear glass wine bottle which was left on the table after our glasses were filled- a nice touch. I chose the Seafood & Steak Skewer ($19) which our very nice waiter Randy said was his favorite. He did warn me that the salmon tended to come out "medium" in the middle (I guess he'd had a complaint from some lady). When I got the plate, the presentation was nice, with the skewers on a bed of rice (they said it was pilaf, but they must have been joking), with green beans (perfectly cooked and seasoned), a delicious fruit salsa, and a piece of warm toasty bread spread with honey butter and then topped with melted co-jack (yummo). The seafood skewer was mushroom, zucchini, red bell pepper, shrimp, and salmon. The salmon was perfectly cooked and will be my next entree here. It's hard to find good seafood in AZ let alone people who don't kill it twice by cooking it far too long. The tenderloin chunks were also cooked a perfect medium-rare as I had requested, but were a bit under-seasoned. Hubby had the Pasta Rustica ($14)- penne with grilled chicken (kind of tough), spicy Italian sausage chunks (very tasty) and a delicious marinara sauce. It was a huge portion, more than he could eat. The only thing that just was not very good was the so-called pilaf.  It tasted like poorly cooked white rice to me.  The dessert menu is limited to 4 items: cheesecake (but since I make the world's best, we just don't bother when dining out), strawberry shortcake for two, key lime and mango pie, and the s'more. So we got the s'more because we were curious- it arrived in a ramekin, and was essentially a dark chocolate cake, left kind of fudgy in the middle, with graham cracker crumbs on the bottom (although the cake really absorbs the flavor and texture), and toasted marshmallows on top. It was delicious, but so rich and chocolaty that I found myself desperate for milk. We shared one, but we couldn't finish it.   Our server told us that the owner and developer is the same as Sam's Cafe's. Apparently the location of 1130 had already housed more than one restaurant that had gone under pretty quickly, but that under this guy's management, 1130 could avoid that fate. I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the service since they have only been open for two weeks. New restaurants so often are an organizational and staffing mess for the first few months, but apparently 1300 has avoided this.  We certainly hope 1130 does well. It's nice to have a great new restaurant in the Arizona Center (to which we go regularly for the movies).   Four and a half stars.

We returned to 1130 for the third time last night. I was craving steak, and remembered that I had seen that they had several options for cut and topping. We were seated immediately in a restaurant that was fuller than we had ever seen it. Our server came quickly, and proved to be adequate, but her style needed some polish. Maybe you could wait more than 2 seconds after giving us the drink menu to ask what we want? Anyway, they were out of Fat Tire, to Hubby's disappointment, but I enjoyed my Stella on tap.   Hubby ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken (subbed for the shrimp). Bad choice, simply because he had just had Pizza a Metro's gnocchi with Alfredo the other day. No one but Mario Batali might top Maurizio's glorious sauce (Hubby just chimed in with "yeah, and that's a *maybe*") . We discovered that the honey butter cheesy bread was now quite different- no discernible honey and too much cheese.   So why the four stars, when nothing yet seems to have been really stellar? The steak, my friends, the steak. Ribeye, medium rare, Classic Phoenix Seasoning. Pretty damn near perfect. The best steak I've had in a long time. I'll be back for more.

I do at least 90% of my grocery shopping here, and this insomniac is thrilled that they are open 24/7. My husband and I love their produce, including heirloom tomatoes, Brussels sprouts on the stalk, and fresh potted herbs. Their international foods aisle has some fun items that we've enjoyed trying. Their house brand products are often fantastic, the California olive oil, aged balsamic vinegar, sorbets and gelatos, and their in-house baked breads to name a few of our favorites. Hubby is also *obsessed* with their Sweet Fire Pizza.   When the next closest "grocery store" is Wal-Mart, I am very grateful that corporate decided not to close this branch. It's a much needed source of fresh and quality food in the Laveen area.

Convinced by the excellent reviews, Hubby and I went to Bourbon Steak's Sunday Night BBQ last night and had a very good time overall.  Pros: nice, comfortable, casual room; varied appetizer buffet- we especially liked the Kobe sliders and the salads; the "complimentary" duck fat fries; the skirt steak and salmon entrees were both outstanding and perfectly cooked; delicious sides- grilled corn smothered in a zesty sauce, grilled asparagus, baked beans; dessert overkill with apple crisp, root beer floats, and chocolate slivers and pecan cookies; mostly great service (they brought me the wrong entree at first).  Cons: obnoxiously loud DJ music- we could not hear each other across the small table until they lowered the shade "wall" directly behind us; neither of us cared for the soups; for me, the gin selection was a little limited.  It was spendy- with 2 drinks, bottled water, and tip it was over $160, but we left very satisfied. In fact, I was so full, I couldn't eat my cookie. But it smelled so good, I wanted to try it later. I asked for a piece of foil so I could wrap it up and put it in my purse. What did they bring me? The single cookie in a huge entree sized tupperware-style container and in a large Bourbon Steak bag. When I laughed, the server explained, "Well, we have to make it look good."   We'll be back to try the regular menu soon.

Being a "First to Review" whore, I convinced Hubby we needed to try the pub with the huge "now open" sign on our way out of Metro Center. Donna D. beat me to the punch, but we are very glad we went anyway. The interior is full of dark woods, with framed pictures, metal and mirrored beer ad signs, a mural, and antique instruments on the wall. The music was great, from The Smiths, REM, and STP to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. A band was setting up as we were leaving. It was quite busy, but we were still able to get a table right away at 9:00 on a Friday night. However, by the time we left, there were no tables to be had and the outside smoking tables were also completely crowded. The customers were totally eclectic, from older very well dressed Scottsdale types to skinheads.   The drink menu seemed pretty standard, with Scotches, Irish whiskeys, bottled and tap beer. The menu was not huge, but let's hope that they do all the food as well as our dinner selections. They made a grand claim that they served the only authentic Shepherd's Pie in Arizona, and Hubby just had to see if they were full of it. Soon he was full of the best shepherd's pie he said he's ever had, made with lamb and champs. I had the fish and chips. The fish was not quite Rosie McCaffrey's and the chips were not quite as good as Rula Bula's, but it was all very very good. The piece of fish was about 12x5" and super crispy, and the chips were potato wedges, well-seasoned and tasty. The tartar sauce was unusually tangy (and delicious) , but the cole slaw was served in a ramekin so small that it fit about a tablespoon's worth, but that turned out to be OK, since it was virtually tasteless. There were also burgers, sandwiches, cottage pie, and flat iron steaks on the menu, and a ridiculous sounding bread and butter pudding for dessert that we will be back to try (they were already out when we asked for it).  It was great to see a brand new place doing so well already, and Tim's will likely end up in our regular rotation of favorites.  UPDATE: We returned and had another good meal, and we noticed that a few things with my fish dinner had changed- less breading, more flavor in the coleslaw (mustard?), but the "chips" were a little soggy this time. We also got to try the bread and butter pudding. I'm not sure what to say about it- it's strange, for sure. A hot rectangle of cripsy on the outside and almost slimy on the inside bread pudding with a few pockets of raisins and a two note taste: hella sweet and bourbon. It was heart-stopping rich. The whole plate was drizzled with a slightly sweet thick butter sauce. It definitely  needed something else- maybe a little cinnamon.

I won some gift certificates at my school's raffle, and never having eaten here before, my husband and I decided to check it out. We were both quite hungry, so we ordered the croissant appetizer. They were under-baked, greasy, and drizzled with honey- both unexpected and disappointing. Hubby's clam chowder was full of grit and my salad was drenched in dressing, topped with a handful of chopped mushy tomato, and also full of grit. The grit police must have been on vaycay. Hubby ordered the prime rib sandwich (which is one of his favorites at Houston's) and it turned out to be a full slab of nearly tasteless meat which was poorly trimmed and ribboned with tough membranes on a lame toasted roll. He would have had to tear into it like a Neanderthal to eat it like a sandwich, so he ended up eating as much as he could stand with knife and fork. The au jus tasted like bouillon- and super strong at that. My entree was far better- a tender and perfectly cooked fillet of beef (although I had ordered the less expensive sirloin) with a delicious baked potato with all the trimmings. I ended up giving him about 1/3 of my steak since I felt so badly for his disaster of a meal. When we complained to the manager, he offered us more gift certificates, and we turned them down. You, too, should just say no to this dark, inexplicably crowded, disaster of a restaurant.

Hubby likes this aquarium store more than I do. Apparently it is really improving from the first time he went a few months ago and they are heading toward a truly excellent and unique set-up. Some of the tanks are so radical I have never seen their equal in any other store.  They have the best prices in town on aquarium pumps and coral-appropriate lighting systems. The staff ranges from owner & excellent to newbie who needs to filter everything through someone else. He has gotten a couple of nice coral pieces and a new healthy blenny, so we have high hopes for the continued quality of their livestock. Unlike other stores, you MUST wear gloves when combing through their live rock. I got horrible splinters of something in my hands.   AZ Seabottom is in the same complex as Fogo e Brasa and their hours are M-F 11-8, Sat. 10-7, Sun. 12-6.

Are you sitting down? Stacy's fried chicken is better than LoLo's. Now, I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. Thin savory coating on crispy skin, and the moistest, tenderest white meat I have ever had. EVER. I needed napkins to wipe the juice off my face, people. I almost gave them 5 stars for that alone.  We also got a 1/2 pound of brisket- thin, delicious slices of moist and smoky goodness. If Bobby Q's brisket is our 10, Stacy's is a 9. The sauce is also very very good. Southern boy Hubby needed him some fried okra which he liked a lot in spite of the fact that they served it with a cornmeal coating when he prefers the breading. Having come off a high from Fez's sweet potato fries the other night, he had to have some of those, too. His conclusion: Fez has no competition there. Stacy's were tasty for sure, but Fez's were much crispier and not so sweet that they "took the sweet out of my grape kool-aid." My mac & cheese tasted home-made, but had a tad more Velveeta than I care for. The sweet tea was sweet, but still not LoLo's sweet (which is complete saturation). We got a red velvet cake to go which I just got up to taste. LoLo's has a little better flavor (Hubby - who was a chemist for years- thinks they use a better grade red food dye), but Stacy's is moister.   We are so going back to try everything else. Stacy's is a real diamond in a rough neighborhood.  UPDATE: We've tried more. The beef sandwich: outrageous; the fried corn: yummo; the rib tips: delish; the cole slaw: one of the best in town; the black eyed peas: so much better than the band; the pecan pie: on par with my own (I used to manage a bakery). Stacy's rocks! Bumpin' it up to 5 stars.

I have stopped by Mocha Bianca a couple of times now, as it is on my new route to work. They open at 6:00 am, and that's perfect for me- 'cause that's when I like to roll into NoSco from CenPho. They are on Bell next to the PV Hospital and across the street from PV High School.  The owner is a nice guy and the shop is really cute and clean. I have only had their signature Mocha Bianca, and the triple shot packs a punch- more so than a Starbucks and a tad less than a Dazbog. It's made a little sweeter than I normally care for, so I'll have to work on adjustments on my subsequent visits. The bagels are fresh with a nice chew to them. The prices are also super reasonable- all the more reason to avoid the 'bucks whenever possible.

Pizza a Metro? A better name would be "Italian Nirvana." if you ask me. Everything Hubby and I had last night was outrageously delicious, super fresh, and very reasonably priced. The owner, Maurizio, is as charming and warm as his first tiny restaurant.  We started with a Caprese salad, with a beautiful house-made mozzarella and wonderful tomatoes, sprinkled with pieces of fresh basil, fresh pepper, and oil and vinegar to add according to our own liking (much appreciated, as I always order dressing on the side, and like to um... taste my salad). Accompanying this was a dish of freshly made flat bread, warm and well-seasoned, it was crispy in parts and chewy in others- all yummy. It came with a relish, but since I learned from Julie P. it had eggplant (I have a serious sensitivity), it was all Hubby's and he loved it.  Hubby ordered a small Capricciosa pizza which was the size of a medium at regular pizza places. He nearly wept with joy at how perfect it was- and that there was now a place where I would happily let him "get his pizza on" without any protest. I had the Pollo al Marsala. It was such a large piece of chicken breast I couldn't finish it, and came with plenty of tender mushrooms, and a rich Marsala sauce so good that I kept sopping it up with the few pieces of leftover bread we had.   Somehow, Maurizio convinced us to try a dessert, and we chose the cannoli. It was fresh and creamy, dotted with chocolate pieces inside. There was not much chit chat- just inhaling.  I mentioned that I was so glad I had heard about Pizza a Metro, and this led to my introducing Maurizio to Yelp. He planned on looking up what we had said that night, and talked about how he was trying to get restaurant reviewers from the Republic and New Times to come, as this was a tough location. If any Yelpers have an "in" at any of the papers, maybe you can suggest a visit to this absolute gem. He used to be at the oft awarded Tutti Santi, but once the word spreads about Pizza a Metro, the "Best Italian" awards will be his instead.

We got to introduce 3 "virgins" to the wonders of PaM tonight- and they all agreed it was tremendous and fabulous. The gnocchi was pillowy and perfect, the saltimbocca was tender and rich, the mussels were fat and flavorful, the carbonara was snatched from its orderer and devoured by his girlfriend who loved what she ordered until she tasted his. The bread was great, as always, and the tapenade bowl was scraped clean. The calamari fritti was light and fresh, and one friend exclaimed that the accompanying marinara was the best she'd ever had. Even though they live in East Mesa, they'll be returning for sure.   I think those of us who are regulars were concerned when Maurizio left to open Amarone. After all, he was such a big part of the charm and ambiance of the place. Let me tell you, the new GM Michael more than fills his shoes. Charming? You bet. Awesome accent? Check. Kind, accommodating, cool under pressure? Yes, yes, yes. Remembers you and your problems with tomatoes? Always. Tonight, I also brought in a cheesecake I had made for my friend (her favorite, and she now lives out of state) and without missing a beat, Michael offered to put it in the walk-in, even brought it out with candles, then took it back and served it to us on plates he decorated as if it were his own dessert. I was so impressed with his generosity. That's the kind of service and small town feel you get at Pizza a Metro. As long as we live here and the place is open, we'll continue to be regulars.

This new Hawaiian place is a couple of doors down from Eba Cafe. I wish it were any where near as good. Unfortunately it is the worst Hawaiian food I have had in the valley (which includes Aloha Kitchen, L&L, Ono, and even Rumbi).   We had the Katsu and BBQ Chicken lunch plates. The Katsu was good white meat chicken and not greasy. Too bad it had zero flavor. The Katsu sauce was like no other I have ever had- cloyingly sweet, instead of zesty and savory like I am used to. The BBQ chicken was well cooked and had flavor, but it was overwhelmingly ginger (not my favorite). The white rice was almost a little greasy, as if it had been buttered with a flavorless butter. The macaroni salad was almost as big of an abomination as the free salad we got. The salad was free because it was nearly dead (literally there were pieces of rotting lettuce in my bowl) and the macaroni salad was a bit too al dente and tasted as if it were dressed with just mayo. Yuck.   Synopsis? Stay away.

Gay men, skip along to the next one.  Everyone else should be at least moderately concerned about female breast health....  I was a little concerned about my first baseline mammogram today, but let me tell you, ladies, it was nothing. Piece of cake. No pain, not even any discomfort. The office of BenOra was very nice, the staff was very efficient and pleasant, and the technology was top notch (digital as opposed to film). I was in and out in less than 45 minutes, including first-time patient paperwork.   So even if you are healthy, current protocol is to have a baseline mammogram once between the ages of 35 and 40. The vast majority of the staff here is female. They do some other types of scanning as well as biopsies. I would recommend BenOra highly- they are complete professionals.

Three stars for the food, but bumped up a star for the outstanding service.  Logan's is a spartan warehouse inside, with the ubiquitous giant pipe ceiling, and cement floors with a chaste smattering of peanut shells.   We were seated and then pretty immediately given a few warm yeast rolls with whipped butter. The rolls were just ok- a little tough and yeasty for my taste. Hubby thought he had just about died and gone to heaven with the big bucket of roasted and salted peanuts on the table. I had a couple and they were tasty. Waters and our drinks came pretty quickly as well. My strawberry margarita was pretty good, and Hubby got the most exotic beer they had- Killian's.   For our main entrees, Hubby had a NY strip and I had a rib-eye. Both arrived more medium than the medium rare we ordered, and when the server stopped by to see how things were, Hubby said the steaks were a little overdone. He apologized, and asked if we wanted new ones. We said, "no," and that it was ok, we didn't want to be wasteful. A manager was at our table a minute later, asking if we were sure. We were super impressed by this- 10x better service than when we last had complaints at the Four Seasons. The sides were alright- mushrooms were sliced and in a heavily seasoned broth, loaded baked potato was standard, but Hubby just loved his baked sweet potato with butter and cinnamon.  At the end of the meal, we were presented with their signature three-tiny-bucket desserts. We hadn't ordered it- it was a surprise comp. One bucket was a rich chocolate mousse with a peanut butter top, another was a hella-sweet warm hot-fudge brownie with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream, and the last was a light cheesecake with strawberry topping. They were all tasty, but my favorite was the cheesecake. Then we got the bill. They had also given us half off both our steaks. We again were quite impressed. Logan's really went above and beyond to make up for a relatively small error. Naturally, we tipped based on what the bill would have been. We'll be back.

We decided to eat at The Keg recently as the nearby Barnes & Noble was the only place in town that had an item in stock that I needed that weekend. We chose immediate seating on the patio rather than a 45 minute wait inside. The misters had been going full force when we arrived, so we thought it wouldn't be too bad. We were mistaken. They are pointed at the arriving patrons, and not on the poor suffering fools on the patio. The initial table to which we were led was completely wobbly, so we asked the server if we could change to one not even 10 feet away. This, apparently, caused a rift in the universe from which the rest of the serving staff failed to recover for the remainder of our time there. We watched several of our dishes walk on by, and bewildered staff take them back indoors, only to return minutes later and ask, "Did you switch tables?" Wow. There are three other tables out here, in completely different stages of their meal. How hard would it have been to figure it out?  Anyway, the food was not bad at all. Our beers were cold and tasty. The bread was just OK- hot and crusty, but a little bland and doughy in the middle. My Caesar salad was overdressed for my taste, but Hubby's French Onion Soup was delicious- when he finally got it. The wait was ridiculous, even after our server said she was checking on it twice and a manager did as well. Hubby's french dip sandwich was less rare than he likes (Houston's french dip is his gold standard), but far better than many others we've had. He liked the fresh horseradish a lot. My prime rib was fork-tender, a little fatty, but quite tasty.   A storm blew in quickly, with bad winds that forced us indoors to track down our waitress and check. She then ran out to collect the family with 2 young girls and brought them inside. Overall, the meal was about a 3.5, but the service was dreadful. Hopefully for The Keg, this is a new restaurant issue, and they will get their act together. Also be warned that this location is only open for dinner right now, and that many menu items that have been highly recommended by other Yelpers are lunch items available at other Kegs only.

I had been wanting to try NOCA since it opened, and we finally made it to a Simple Sunday Supper recently. We certainly don't mind spending $100+ on a good dinner, but this was not it.   Hubby got the vegetarian option- beet manicotti. It was better than he expected it to be, but by comparison to the size of my meal, his portion was quite small. I got the fried chicken and wondered who the hell had named it the best in the valley when I was sitting there wishing I had a plate of Lo-Los'. I thought the breading was way too thick and doughy and didn't care for the marinade. The corn on the cob as well cooked, but nothing special. The potato salad was average at best, and the biscuit was fine. The stand-out was the supplement of pork and beans. The flavor was outstanding, but the beans were a tad al-dente. Hubby didn't particularly care for his wine.  Now, I love sweets, but dessert was overkill. The best thing was the cotton candy. Our sundaes were completely soupy, and then we got handed an average chocolate chip shortbread to take home.  I found the service to be overkill as well. I mean, I can pour my own beer, for heaven's sake. The wait staff was always hovering. What we didn't get, however, was a visit from the owner, who seemed to stop by every other table in the restaurant. Maybe he could tell we were disappointed, and just didn't want to hear it.

Query: what kept Crockett and Tubbs lean and sexy? Why, desserts from Miami Rice, of course! Oh, come on, people! I'm shocked no one went there already...  The owner, Susan, is a total sweetheart who gave me lots of information about the business, the up and coming locations, and told me that they are willing to work with school groups for fund-raising nights. Since my new school is right around the corner, this will be something I'll take her up on.  Besides the rice pudding, which is totally delish, they also have smoothies, coffee, non-tangy fro-yo, and tons of toppings. And a Yelp sticker right on the front door (the mark of the Gabster?). I got the coconut creme, peanut butter, and chocolate to go and a twist cone for a snack right then. Everything is fresh and delicious, low-fat, and not too sweet- the perfect treat.

This Yogurtlicious location is, unfortunately, closed due to non-payment of rent, just like several other food establishments in the  shopping plaza on the corner of 35th Ave.and Southern. That leaves us the awful Chinese buffet and the surly Subway. Oh- and Taco Bell. Awesome.

Now in the culinary wasteland that is Laveen, we decided to give the Jumbo Buffet a try. Never again. Very few food items were up to temperature, which explains my digestive distress later on. The sushi was sketchy looking and tasted old. The meat was either dried out or fatty. The steak on the Mongolian BBQ looked as if it had been there a week. The ice milk was hard and the other desserts were all pre-packaged and virtually flavorless. This buffet is an epic fail in my opinion.

After some nightmares with Chase, who inexplicably closed the checking account of the non-profit organization for students in which I am involved, I decided to try to take the account to Wells Fargo. This branch is closest to my school, and the banker I worked with made the process of opening up a new non-profit account very easy, and I did not have to file all kinds of awful paperwork that Chase would have made me do. I have not had good experiences at every branch (7th St, just past Camelback, I'm looking at you), but this one let me keep the organization running, financially speaking, with a minimum of red tape. Much appreciated!

Not hot. Not even warm. Stone cold, kinda hard, not very fresh tasting. Hella sweet. Unsatisfying.   Seriously, they are damaging their "brand" by opening this type of store. There is no difference between the Roosevelt store and picking up a box at the Circle K. What's next, a Little Debbie store front with a drive through?  I needlessly feared that this location would spell a serious loss of business for our nearby Rainbow Donuts. I now appreciate them even more by comparison to Krispy Kreme.

North 51 Grill is pretty much on the corner of the 51 and Shea, in a mostly dead strip mall with a Pizza Hut and a Subway, and the newly opened Storm Wisdom.   We stopped in for lunch recently and discovered that it used to be a Dirty Drummer. They even still had a DD neon sign on the wall (turned off). The place was nearly empty, but so were our tummies, so we stayed. It wasn't exactly spotless, so I guess they're keeping the spirit of the old name. The waitress was good, made helpful suggestions, and kept our iced teas full.   We shared a cheese crisp, which came out hot and cheesy, with a really really good house-made green salsa. Hubby had a cheese enchilada with green sauce, which was kind of smallish and the cheese was not melted through. He really liked the green sauce, though, and the grilled broccoli he chose as a side. The refried beans were pretty flavorless. I had a ribeye sandwich. It was fine, cooked a tad more medium than I would like, but was flavorful and sparsely topped with grilled onions and mushrooms. My side salad was decent and quite large.   Will we be back? Maybe if we're in the area and starving again, but it's certainly not destination dining.

Hubby and I were here tonight for a grand and glorious breaking of his diet. He had been before to the one in Houston, and had been looking forward to the new Scottsdale location. For being open only 3 nights, the service went quite smoothly and the staff and management we met were all great. We started out with drinks- a gin and tonic ($10) and a caipirinha ($8.25)- both were strong and very good. The wine list is extensive, for those who prefer the vino. Delicious little popovers arrived at the table, and we headed off to the salad bar. Far better and fresher than Fogo E Brasa's, it had a variety of cheeses (including chunks of parm and fresh mozzarella), smoked salmon, prosciutto, salami, sun dried tomatoes, olives, marinated bell peppers, asparagus spears, mushroom caps, and seafood and chicken salads, just to name about a third of the offerings.  Then came a veritable torrent of meat. The beef was the best, and came in a variety of cuts and preparations. We liked the Ancho (rib eye), the Picanha (the classic sirloin cut in the half moon shape), and the garlic beef best. The pork ribs were really well done and juicy, and the sausage was quite flavorful. The chicken was a tad dry, and the lamb was too gamey for our liking (and we usually like lamb).   Side dishes were brought to our table, in appropriately modest portions. There were squares of polenta, which I really liked but Hubby did not care for, and mildly garlic mashed potatoes, and yummy fried plantains.   Dessert choices were pretty typical: a creme brulee, a flan, 2 types of cheesecake, and 2 types of chocolate cake. Hubby wanted what he had enjoyed at the Houston Fogo before: the papaya cream topped with creme de cassis liqueur ($8.25). It was more runny than mousse-y, and the papaya taste was pretty subtle, with the liqueur being the top note.  There is a rather unnecessary valet parking service for $3, when the parking lot surrounding the place is huge. Not so huge, however,  that the many douche-bags who double parked went unnoticed. The bathrooms are nice. The dinner, which is all you care to eat, is $42.50 per person. I'm sure we'll be back for special occasions.

Wow. Even Lafayette, LA born Hubby was seriously impressed with Flavors of Louisiana. The restaurant was far from full on a Saturday night, but the customers came in steadily. It is a small place, but very clean, and rather sparsely decorated. At least you can taste right away where their priorities are.   Hubby had the special of the night- three pieces of tender, perfectly cooked catfish smothered in crawfish etoufee. He had asked for, and was told that he would receive etoufee only, but got the special anyway. He loved it, but this mix-up is the reason for the 4 stars. Even though it was in a darker roux, which he normally does not prefer, he licked his plate clean. I got the shrimp po'boy which came in a large basket with fries. It was two 6" halves of a fresh baguette with lettuce, tomato, a zippy sauce, and plenty of perfectly cooked battered and fried shrimp. Our dining companions had an equally huge and tasty fried oyster po'boy, a side of fresh and tangy cole slaw, and a bowl of delicious seafood gumbo. Nothing was spicy, just super flavorful. The boys got the peach cobbler dessert, and even though we girls both said we didn't much care for peach cobbler, we certainly helped the boys polish off the big bowls when they got to the table.   Even though FOL is quite a drive for us, we will be back very soon. Please note that as of October 1, 2009, they will be closing early on Saturday nights- 8:00 instead of 9:00 PM.

I saw Amy B's review the other day, and decided to check out the Breakfast Joynt, as it is pretty close to where I work. The decor is a little unusual for a breakfast and lunch place- normally these places are, shall we say, kitchen-y and perky- but here, it's a little more like a friendly pub with all the cherry wood, but decorated with paintings rather than roadside kitsch.   I ordered the traditional breakfast. My over-easy eggs were a little raw, but the hash-browns were crispy, just as I had ordered them, and flavorful, with a hint of onion. The bacon was thick and delicious, and the pancakes were yummy in spite of a somewhat chewy texture. The coffee was fine, and I appreciated the giant glasses of water.   The owners and staff were all very friendly, and when I asked one of them about what was in the pancake batter, she said she would have the chef come to my table. He was a great guy, and admitted that he was disappointed with the texture of the pancakes himself of late, and planned to adjust the recipe.   I'm sure I'll be back to try other items on the menu. It's not the Good Egg where you have an overwhelming 4 page menu, but everything on the Breakfast Joynt's menu is a breakfast or lunch classic. They have healthy options as well, such as fruit and yogurt and items made with only egg-whites. Then again, they also have a Monte Cristo and chicken fried steak. Good thing Gold's Gym is right next door...

Facing day 3 of nonstop parent-teacher conferences, I knew I needed a good cup of coffee to keep me going. So I headed to Dazbog- or, if you will, Commie Coffee :) - this morning, excited to try the new coffee shop in the Promenade. I was surprised and sad to realize that they don't open until 7:30 am. Pretty unusual for a coffee shop. So I came back on my lunch break, and I'm glad I did.   The two young baristas were very friendly, and chatted with me as one made the mocha and the other negotiated putting a huge red velvet cupcake in a bag, trying not to smush the frosting. The management of this Dazbog is the same as it was when they were a Starbucks. The young man told me that the owner tasted Dazbog when he was in Denver, and decided to convert. They have teas and fruit smoothies as well as your standard coffee favorites, and unlike the 'bucks, they have *fresh* pastries from a local bakery. Much appreciated, for sure. However, the sandwich selection was pre-packaged like they are in gas stations, and really, who eats those things? I say do the savory side better, or lose it. There are plenty of quick lunch solutions in the Promenade- Dazbog can do without it.   The coffee was very good, not too sweet- which I appreciate- and packed a punch. There are 3 shots in a large at Dazbog, whereas I have to order an extra shot in a Starbucks venti. Oh- and the sizes are just small, medium, and large- you don't have to learn a new cofflanguage to order. The red velvet cupcake was very yummy and so huge I took it back to school and shared it with 5 co-workers. I will be back for sure, but it would be far more often if they opened earlier.

OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day...   The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course.   Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake?   Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.

After a movie at the Cinemark, our choices were limited for vegetarian options at the Mesa Riverview, so we decided to try Red Brick Pizza. It's definitely fast food, but they do bake the pizzas on terra cotta stone, at over 1000 degrees they say. It was hardly Cibo or Pizza a Metro, but better than other fast food pizzas like Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. It's a gas powered oven, not wood, so don't go expecting smoky goodness.   I had the 7" Pizza Bianco with sausage, ricotta, mushrooms and pine nuts, and Hubby had the 4-cheese. He said mine was better than his. It was a tad greasy, but had decent flavor. We also had some cheesy bread sticks, which were hot and soft- pretty decent. With two self-serve drinks, dinner was about $18.   They also serve some sort of Italian sandwich/salad combo and gelato, neither of which we tried. The place was pretty busy when we arrived, and they have a variety of seating choices, with about half having a small flat-screen TV mounted right at your table. Red Brick is an acceptable option at the Riverview if you're hungry and not expecting much.

I have rented from this Budget location several times now and have always had a great experience. They are laid back, no pressure to add all the extras, and friendly. The cars I have rented have always been in good condition and mechanically sound.   My only complaint is that the hours they are open are more limited than some other locations. They close at 5:30 on weekdays and are open for a while on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays. They have a night drop box, however, and have never tried to overcharge me for an extra day when I use the box. Their prices are consistently more reasonable than other locations.

Storm Wisdom had only been open a couple of days when, driving down Shea, we noticed the sign and decided to stop in and see what the store was all about.   Storm Wisdom calls itself "A Spiritual Oasis" and has items for both the collector of geological specimens and for those who use stones and crystals as part of their spirituality. The latter aspect is subtle enough that even those who would be uncomfortable in a "new age" store will be comfortable here. In fact, it's hard not to be, surrounded by so many beautiful things. Storm Wisdom is also a gallery, and features many paintings, sculptures both still and kinetic, and crystals and geodes so huge they can most certainly be displayed as Earth's own art. They also sell beautiful velvet bags embellished with stones and embroidery, meteorites, wands, crystal bowls for sound therapy, leather-bound journals, and jewelry. There were many pieces of jewelry I would have loved to purchase as the prices were quite reasonable, but we found an amethyst pendant for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day. It was a risk, as it was a really unique piece, and rather bold. She called yesterday and said she absolutely loved it.   They do also have a number of meeting rooms, one large for group workshops, and several small ones for private readings and healing sessions.   The owner, Charles, is friendly yet unobtrusive, and very knowledgeable. The store is impeccable, peaceful, and so very tasteful. We'll be back soon.

I'm torn about Tiburon. On the one hand, to eat in front of one of AZ's largest aquariums is awesome, especially for reef tank nerds like me and my husband.   It's just too bad that the restaurant itself isn't better. The menu only has one vegetarian main entree on it, so that's what my husband had to get. It was supposed to be grilled veggies with a portobello centerpiece. What came were some (as in not many for $16) limp veggies with maybe 1/3 of a portobello. When my husband pointed this out to the waitress, she spoke to the chef who said that he had run out of mushrooms. They comped us a dessert to make up for it. The creme brulee was fine- about like most served in chain restaurants. My steak was pretty good, but was served with a few giant acrid onion rings and lukewarm mashed potatoes.   I realize that we are paying in part for the atmosphere, but it's really hard to justify when the food is so sub-par and the restaurant is obviously poorly run.

The store itself is just fine, but the five stars are really for Jaimie, the wonder groomer. My cat, Charlotte, is a hot mess in the fur department and simply must be professionally groomed. I had gone to three other groomers before finding Jaimie. One was great, but never responded to voicemails for appointments. The other two overcharged and clipped one of Charlotte's nipples. Jaimie listened to my concerns as well as what I have noticed about Charlotte's likes and dislikes regarding her fur-cut. She takes her time, giving pets a break when needed. She will also trim nails and check ears, as well as let you know if she notices anything unusual on the skin. Jaimie makes sure that her customers are satisfied, takes notes on the particulars of each pet's needs, and even calls to follow up. Charlotte and I have both loved her cuts and the genuine care from Jaimie.   There are not a ton of groomers in the Valley that take care of cats, and from my experience, even fewer who do it well. Jaimie is a major exception, and if she were ever to leave Petsmart, we would follow her.

When my husband wanted to veer into Cold Stone the other day, I felt my nose wrinkle, and the words "Nah, let's go to Scooptacular later" came out of my mouth. That's when I knew that this adorable new store had me as a repeat customer. The owner is as sweet as her ice cream and all of the employees have been friendly and patient. You can try as many flavors as you'd like, and believe me, you'll want to try them all.   Oatmeal Cookie has become our favorite, but I also loved the German Chocolate, and the Red Velvet with its ribbons of frosting (very rich). All the ice cream is super premium, and is served in very generous scoops. I usually have to pass my two-scoop cone on to my husband to finish, especially if I get anything with chocolate in it. I would say the prices are equivalent to getting a pint of Haagen Dazs but the quality is even better, being freshly made. And supporting an awesome local business tastes pretty good, too.  I once asked the owner if the store was a chain, because it looked so much better and "put together" than many independent places. It is bright, super clean, and a word I seldom use: cheery. The menu is large and easy to read and navigate. Obviously, a lot of thought and care went into this store. It shows. I would encourage the downtown foodies to come to Laveen just to have Scooptacular's ice cream.  I'll bet you'll turn your backs on Cold Stone, too.

One of the best indulgence burgers I have had in a long time. Seriously greasy, seriously yum. Loved all the topping options, loved the peanuts in the shell "appetizer." Did not care for the fries, however. On the day we went, they were quite overdone, and there were really far too many, even for two people. I felt badly about the waste. I will be back on occasion for the burgers- my heart can't take more than that. But I will love every bite...

Unfortunately, I must concur with previous reviewers: SeaLife is just lame. There were absolutely no specimens there that I have not seen many times elsewhere, and quite a few of which my husband and I have at home in our own reef tanks. In three tanks today we saw dead and dying fish. No wonder they had precious little live coral, if they can't even keep fish alive. The plastic coral substitutes were just awful looking, and my husband couldn't help but correct one of their "experts" who told another patron that a rock he pointed to was covered in algae, when in fact it had some live mushroom coral on it. The passageways were just too crowded and filled with screaming children, and their cacophony echoed off of the tanks and cave-like interior. Save your money and take the family on a trip to San Diego.

We have been to the week-old Villa's twice now, once for dinner and once for breakfast. The space is cozy, with about 7 booths, and a colorfully painted wall with a tiled opening where you order and then another where you pick up your food. All of the employees have been very friendly and willing to chat and answer questions. The chef/owner, Rene, told us that he had worked 130 hours in the first week, cooking from 6 am to 10 pm, but that all of the early positive feedback made it worthwhile. We didn't get a chance to meet his wife, Angelica, but she was the one who had contacted me via Yelp messaging weeks ago, inviting me to come in and give them a try (as I had been complaining of the woeful Laveen restaurant scene) and also kept interest piqued on Facebook. Very smart use of free social networking sites, I'd say.   On to the food: my husband tried a carne asada burrito, California style, and declared it one of the best burritos he's had in the valley. It had carne, cheese, fresh pico, and potatoes in a large fresh flour tortilla. I had a bite, and it was indeed scrumptious. I asked for a combination of the carnitas and carne platters, because I wanted to try both meats, and they were cheerfully accommodating. Both meats were tender, but I found the carne to be much more flavorful. I have become used to the style of carnitas at Garcia's Las Avenidas,which is cooked in more spices. I also prefer the refried beans from Garcia's, but Villa's were pretty good. The pico both looked and tasted super fresh, and the rice was very moist and flavorful with some bits of fresh corn, peas, and tomato scattered throughout. For breakfast two days later, we each had a breakfast burrito, most of which have eggs, potato, and cheese, with some type of meat. I had it with bacon, but my husband, who tries to eat vegetarian as often as he can stand it, had it meatless. He found he missed the meat, especially after he grabbed my burrito and took a few healthy chomps out of it. The burritos were very good sized- I couldn't finish mine, and Bob was quite full after his (and the rest of mine). It's the kind of breakfast that will keep you going all morning.   We are thrilled that Villa's has lived up to its promises of great, fresh, all in-house made Mexican cuisine, and we will return often to work our way through the menu. Finally, Laveen, we have a great restaurant!

Reef Culture is the Valley's newest coral and saltwater fish store, having opened in the same hard-to-find location that formerly housed About the Reef. Aside from the location, the two stores are quite different. Reef Culture seems much bigger inside, definitely cooler, and much more pristine.   They have some *huge* tanks filled with more coral frags than I have seen outside of a trade show- with some rarer specimens I have only seen at shows. They have plenty of fish from which to choose as well, and many popular ones, like several varieties of clown fish, have been tank raised. They have a good selection of chemicals, fish and coral food (pellets and frozen), tank supplies, and live rock. They also sell reef stew, RODI water, and two salinity levels of pre-mixed salt water. We appreciated that they packed our frozen food in paper- with an ice pack!- to keep it frozen all the way home. The prices I saw were all competitive with other reputable aquarium stores in town.   Every one who helped us, or offered to help, was friendly and knowledgeable. What I also appreciated is when an employee happened not to know an answer to one of my husband's picky questions, he went and looked it up immediately. To me, that says they care about getting it right, rather than saving time or face by bullshitting the customer. Impressive.   I know we'll be back to Reef Culture often- especially now that we have a GPS to get us there.

Thanks, fellow Yelpers, for the stellar reviews of Brandon, the wonder groomer. My cat Charlotte has out-of-control fur that needs at least semi-annual shaving, and I was not happy with the last groomer who made her face uneven and lopped off half of her whiskers. I told Brandon what Charlotte liked (the lion poof tail) and what annoyed her (the leg fur they left long) and he groomed her exactly to my specifications. He even clipped her nails, gave her a bath, and cleaned out her ears. Charlotte disliked the bath, but was otherwise putty in Brandon's gentle hands.   It became very clear that he is a true animal lover as we exchanged animal rescue stories. He also volunteers his talents at the Humane Society so that the scraggly ones look more presentable for adoption and has fostered for a local no-kill shelter. He has over 20 years experience as a groomer. I couldn't believe that after 1.25 hours of work on Charlotte, he only charged $45.  A Doggie in the Window is unpretentious, as others have said, but clean and comfortable. One thing I noticed were all the potted plants- including some beautiful orchids. It makes sense that someone who can keep an orchid thriving would also be such a highly regarded, loving, attentive groomer.

I'm very sad to have to dock A Doggie in the Window. I had such a great experience the first time, I was eager to bring my cat Charlotte back. I called for an appointment about 6 weeks ago. I left a clear and detailed message. No return call. About 2 weeks later, I call again. Same result. From Aleta L.'s review, it doesn't sound like they have stopped doing cats. My cat was so well behaved last time, I know that wasn't it. I left a generous tip, and wrote a 5-star Yelp review, so that can't be it.  So, what gives? Answer your messages.

Freddy quoted us $2000 for the exact same work that a plumber recommended by a colleague ended up doing for less than $400.

I ate lunch a few times here this year when I worked nearby. I'd gotten a couple of breakfast burritos that were acceptable, with my major complaint being the nearly raw and flavorless tortilla. I guess I am spoiled by Carolina's tortillas. I also think it's baloney that they charge the to-go people for chips, but not those who sit and dirty their tables. How does that make sense?  The real travesty is the $5 fundido Wednesday special. My colleagues were so gaga over it for weeks, that I finally broke down and got one. When I expressed my *ahem* disappointment, I got labeled a "foodie snob."  If being a foodie snob means that I don't find bland, boiled, hard chicken surrounded by a messy pile of other sub-standard ingredients acceptable, then I am a proud foodie snob. I've had fundido at plenty of other Mexican places around town, and this is no fundido.

With the probability of being caught between houses looming large, we decided to rent a nearby storage unit. An online search revealed that the U-Store-It on Washington was competitively priced, especially because we didn't require climate control. I reserved online, and promptly got a call from the very nice manager, Alicia. I stopped by later that afternoon to fill out the paperwork.   Insurance (at a minimum of $8 a month) is mandatory since their competition down the road had a huge fire (started by a pissed off girlfriend) and only 4 of their customers had been insured- everyone else just lost everything. They also require disk locks, but they offer two brands there, one for about $7 and another for $13. The 10x20 unit we rented will be $157 with everything included- next month. Be sure to mention the "First Month Free" deal and they will give it to you.   The unit itself has a light and two 3-prong electrical outlets, and was very clean. The owner lives in an apartment on site, and there are security cameras, razor-wire fences, and individual pin-code gate control upon both entry and exit for security. Minus one star for narrow pathways- two normal sized vehicles can pass each other carefully, but we found ourselves trapped in several aisles by oversized trucks with trailers. Normal access hours are 6am to 10 pm, but if 24-hour access is needed, you can just ask the owner ahead of time, and you can do so. I was left with the impression that this place is responsible and well-run.

AVOID! Unless, of course, you want a whole bunch of your possessions ruined by water that leaks through the roof and down the back wall of your unit. Unless, of course, you don't mind dealing with employees who truly don't give a shit about you and your ruined possessions. Sure, we took out the insurance. But have we actually gotten to speak to someone yet about our ruined property a week later? No. We stopped by today to get our lock and close the rental agreement. No one was there. Apparently they feel it's ok to take an hour and a half lunch when they are only open from 8 to 5 on Saturdays, because, after all, who gives a shit about customer service? Not U-Store-it, that's for sure. Oh, and their "Courtesy Phone" right next to the office door? The one that you can call and speak to someone when the office is closed? Yeah, it dials and then immediately hangs up. Over and over again. I know because I tried several times.  So screw you, U-Store-it. My initial positive impression has only made me angrier.

We've eaten at Chipotle several times before, but never at this location. And never again at this location. The entree items we got were just fine. The chips were cold, but that is far from the problem.   The issue was the 20-something man who appeared to be the shift manager. First, he was wearing Man-dex. Yes, that's what I said. Spandex. And they were cropped to boot. Somehow, I don't think they were a uniform option. Then, as he weirdly danced around the dining area, doing what, I don't know (certainly not wiping off the filthy tables), a vision came to me of Jame Gumb. I'll give you all a minute to shudder. Then there was also the patronizing and borderline racist interactions with his largely Hispanic staff. He loudly announced to us that he had just learned the Spanish word for "turkey." Then he turned to the man making our food, said the word, and then made a turkey sound. Yes, he gobble-gobbled at the poor man. He did this again and again. It was clear that the staff was embarrassed.   My husband and I were flabbergasted. It was hard not to stare at him in awe of his assholery. Was he high? Could be. Was he a loser who had no business being in charge of a store? Most definitely.   Chipotle, call us when you've replaced this jerk.

I came here last week because I had been in a car accident, and since it appeared that I was pretty banged up, but no obvious broken bones or concussion. It took two MA's to take my blood pressure. My husband noticed that neither of them aligned the cuff properly and one couldn't even manage to place the pulse ox clip on my finger the right way. The "doctor" barely looked at me. At the very least I would have expected that she would have asked me to take my shirt off so she could examine the extent of my bruising, which was already a lurid purple hours after the accident. I thought I would get an x-ray to make sure I hadn't cracked a rib. But no. I guess you can tell everything you need to know by listening to my lungs. All she did was tell me that the pain will get worse before it gets better (no shit, Sherlock!) and write me an Rx for pain medication. Had I known at the time that it was for hydrocodone with acetaminophen, I would have asked for something else. My clinical trial med cuts the efficacy of acetaminophen in half. But I can't go back, because that would be "drug seeking behavior," warnings against which were posted prominently in the waiting room. The best had to be when I was leaving and both the incompetent MA and the front desk girl said, "Have a good night!" Really?!? You both know I was in an accident, and you both saw that I could barely walk from the pain. F*ck you. and go back to night school.

This Barro's location is very hit or miss. We have had great pizza from here and we have also had seriously underdone pizza (wet doughy crust) and once they put anchovies all over the pizza although I had not ordered it, nor said anything even close to "anchovies". The underdone pizza was delivery, and when we called to complain, they re-delivered another one. With the anchovy mistake, I had picked it up. I had to drive back to the store to get my remade pizza. When my husband had called, he was told that the manager would give us something extra for our inconvenience. When I arrived, the young woman behind the counter almost gave me the wrong pizza, and the manager never even came out to apologize, let alone comp us anything.   Now, having worked in the restaurant industry, neither my husband nor I are asshats who make a scene and demand things for free. But when the promise is made, and there's no delivery...  I NEVER had a single issue when I got our Barro's in North Phoenix on my way home from work. We were excited to have a branch nearer to us, but my confidence in this location is seriously shaken.

The front office woman was nice and seemed quite competent. I was seen quite quickly, but by a woman I never would have thought was a doctor. She was dressed in street clothes, with no white coat or even a name badge. I came in with animal bites, and she barely even looked at my hands. She observed me from a distance with her arms folded. Really?!? What the hell? She prescribed me an antibiotic and told me to look out for swelling and fever. Good thing 48 hours later I was able to have another doctor assess my injuries during a regularly scheduled appointment. If her bedside manner is typical for this location, find somewhere else to go.

Let me add to the other reviews that mention the endless lines, malfunctioning exhibits, poorly trained staff, ridiculous refreshment prices, unadvertised parking fees and no warning that purses and strollers are not allowed inside. We were there on the infamous first Saturday, however, and I understand that there may be early glitches, and other excuses for Marvel to have robbed us of $100+.   Here's another reason they suck: my husband was injured in one of the only experiences that was functional that day. I will fully admit that it was his fault, thinking he could be more flexible than his frame allows. The security and EMT staff were very kind and prompt. The husband ended up in the ER, but fortunately his injuries were not too serious. However, what appalls me is that they did not follow up with a phone call to either me or my husband when several staff members emphatically said they would, in order to make sure he was ok. I guess they were just relieved that we have insurance and are not litigious.
