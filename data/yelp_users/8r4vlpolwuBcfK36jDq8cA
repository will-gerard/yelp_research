Great service and great food. Love the ziosk for fast check out. Also has game apps you can play for. 99 cents. Great for keeping the kids entertained.

I was disappointed when I got home to find one item missing that I paid for. I ordered 3 loaded potato grilled but received 2. I got the rest of my order just fine.   It just sucks when you spend the last of your cash and don't get what you pay for.  Order #368569

House fried rice is awesome. Delivery is fast and still hot. Add a little soy sauce and siracha and you're in fried rice heaven.

Love this place. They always have what I'm looking for in stock and the prices can't be beat, especially the in store purchase prices.   This is my wife and I's go to shop for new firearms. They have a good selection of used firearms as well. I would highly recommend this place.

First time here so I tried the chicken and steak. I must say I really liked the chicken tacos. I would eat here again and next time I'll bring some friends.

Chuck was very professional , had a sketch drawn up quickly. Super cool dude and now I have killer tattoo that I'm happy with. I would highly recommend him.

My wife and I both purchased a firearm here last month. She got a 12 gauge 24" barrel Mossberg 500 shotgun with walnut stock, and I got a Mossberg 702 Plinkster 22LR.  We both felt very comfortable in the shop. Great customer service and didn't feel pressured at all. The store is a pretty decent size with a wide variety of firearms, ammunition and gear.   We plan on making our next firearm purchases here based on our initial experience and would highly recommend this place to anyone in the market for a firearm or gear.
