My experience at Baseline Dental Care was a mixed bag.  In short, I found Dr. Payne lacking in bedside manner and some of the staff were helpful and some were snippy.  I had problems getting my prostetic fitted and both the dentist and some of the staff seemed impatient with me and I had some communication problems with them.  Some of the staff were quite nice though.  I am used to better care and better communication from a dentist and their staff, so I may be spoiled but I can safely say, I have had better!  ***LONG VERSION OF STORY***  I chose Baseline Dental Care because they are a part of Dental Works and my old dentist was a part of that group. Sadly the the root of my tooth was broken and infected which meant it had to be pulled.  The way this was handled upset me.  I was in the chair when Dr. Payne came in.  I had never met him before.  The first words he said were "I saw your xrays" and he sounded upset which was scary for me.    When I got the news, then I worked with the front office to do the cost information.  It was right before Christmas and I was in pain. Unfortunately, the tooth could not be pulled right away or I would have to go without my prostetic (henceforth called a flipper) and would have to go to work toothless.  Plus I had been searching for a new job and going toothless to interviews and Christmas festivities did not appeal.  I was told that the antibiotics might help with the pain or they might not.  Dr Payne told me that the pain could be unpredicable and I might be in as much pain as I was right at that moment for the whole two weeks.  Then I had made my choices and I was going to pay for the flipper ($700) and try to make it through the holiday as best I could.  I tried to ask the assistant whether I could pay by check or bankcard  but she didn't know.  She went away and I had to wait and wait for someone to come back. I needed to get back to work so I went up front, but the receptionist was busy.  So I went back and suddenly, overwhelmed by the expense and the pain, I started crying.  The front lady finally came back and she was very nice and soothing at that point.  We talked about the plans and I was told that I would pick up the flipper before I got the tooth pulled and maybe the oral surgeon could fit it in.  If it didn't fit, I would come to the dental office right after the tooth pulling and get it fixed.  (Luckily the antibiotic did help with the pain and I had a nice Christmas.)  I set the tooth pulling for the afternoon Jan 3 the soonest I could, but then I had to re-schedule it one more week after due to work conflicts.  The flipper was supposed to be in that week, but Dr. Payne's office never called me about it. I called them and spoke to them Friday the 4th to make sure it was there, and at that time I let them know I was getting my tooth pulled on the afternoon of Jan 8. We arranged when I could pick up the flipper, on Monday.  On Monday I came on my lunch hour and picked up the flipper and spoke *again* to a staff member and let them know I was getting my tooth pulled the following afternoon and would come in AFTER the tooth was pulled to fit the flipper if needed.  They said okay.  Then Tuesday I got my tooth pulled.  However, the flipper didn't fit into my mouth so my friend was driving me to get it fitted.  I called them on the way to let them know.  I knew their office closed at 4 p.m. and it was 3 so I wanted to give them a heads up (be polite).  The staff who answered the phone informed me the dentist wasn't there.  I was very upset and she was very snippy with me and told me I had to come in at 10:30 the next a.m. (which would cost me money as I wouldn't be able to work until after.)  So upset, I called my old dentist office and begged them to fit the flipper and told them I would pay them money to do it.  They refused but they were pretty mad at Baseline too and called them.  They suggested I go into Baseline the next day to get it fitted and that Baseline would give me a partial refund for my trouble.  I went the next day to Baseline and they did not offer me a refund.  The flipper DID NOT FIT, so they did make me a temporary temporary flipper and sent it back to get fitted, so I figured they were having extra expense so I didn't press the matter.  However, the remaining times I dealt with them the dentist ranged from overly familar (hitting me on the arm and calling me "woman") to very unpleasant (lecturing me on how the flipper was the "cheapest choice" so that's why I couldn't eat with it).  I found him difficult to work with and I do not think he and I are compatible as patient and dentist.  One dentist assistant who was pleasant and gentle with me was Michelle.  I liked her a lot.  I think the communication and the bedside manner of the staff and dentist could be much improved.  I am going to get an implant for my tooth and if I need a temporary cap or need the flipper to be modified during that process, I intend to go to another dentist.

I went to Champs a while back in February for a hair cut and a mani-pedi.  I was having a beauty day and had a facial scheduled across the way at Southwest Institute of Natural Aesthetics for the same day.   After some initial scheduling problems and call backs, I ended up scheduling my hair cut first (for the convenience of the stylist who wanted to leave early that Saturday), then my facial at SWINA, then my mani-pedi at the end of the day.  My hair cut didn't go well.  I had a description of what I wanted and explained it very carefully that I wanted a certain length, but also some layers so it would do more than just lie there.  My hair cut was very fast and I noticed my stylist had a person waiting for them.  I was surprised it was done so quickly, but I left and went to the next appointment, kind of early.  Came back to the salon and had a great mani-pedi and a lot of fun with the nail technician who was personable and great at her job.  When I went home to do my "after" photos I was surprised.... I seemed to have no layers.  I went to work the next Monday and showed it to my friend at work and she told me, "Yes, you have NO layers!"  So THAT'S WHY THE HAIRCUT was so fast.  I called the Salon over and over again on Monday and there was no answer, not even an answering machine!  I was stunned as I had just been there Saturday and I was surprised that no one was answering.  I was so confounded by this that after my dance class that night, I dropped by, even though I knew they'd be closed.  I thought, well, if they are closed on Monday maybe they will have a sign for that on their window, even if the Internet doesn't have it yet.  But no, the window showed them to have Monday hours so I was still confused.  I called Tuesday and got a human being, a nice man, who scheduled me a make up cut for the cut that didn't meet my needs.  He explained that they decided to close on Monday "because the stylists didn't want to work those hours" but had not update fliers, the internet, or put a note on the window.   I got my make up cut and it was a very nice cut.  My stylist was nice, personable and did a great job.  When I checked out, the stylist made sure to tell me that the tip I gave the first stylist was transferred to her, but I tipped her again anyway.  I felt they should keep my initial tip for the first stylist, who did, in fact, actually work on Saturday and cut my hair.  I felt I should have a choice in this.  I don't think they listened to me though.  So I think my experience at this salon was mixed at best.  There are some awesomely talented folks working there.  The atmosphere is low key.  It is not a high-falutin', fancy schmany salon.  The prices are medium.    They could improve customer service a bit, and communication. Put in an answering service for the days off, make sure the hours are updated and posted whenever changed, and perhaps they could've scheduled my initial hair cut better so there was a stylist who had good time and attention for me.    I don't think the first stylist was a bad stylist; I think she was distracted.  I would've prefered to have them tell me I needed to schedule my hair cut on a different day, then to try to accomodate me but give me a poor cut. I knew initially I was calling at the last minute with a request for two appointments, so it would've been better to just give me a mani-pedi and have me do the haircut separately than to have me scheduled with a stylist who was distracted and unable to "hear" my requests.  I would say give them a try, especially if you feel you can work around possibly communication glitches.  For me, it is hard to go back, and I will probably try somewhere else first, but I might go back in the future if I dont' find another salon nearby that's better.

I enjoy this for my delivery place.  The food is very yummy and the delivery is on time.  Lots of choices for delivery and accepts cards and/or cash and you can order online.    The Blanco could use a bit more of the butter/garlic thing, but it is adequate.  I like the pizza okay, and it is definitely better than average, but i would probably put it more at a 3.5 than a 4.  However, you can make your own combination and one of these days I'm going to hit on the perfect combination, but so far, my favorite is pineapple and canadian bacon, don't hate me.  The Baked Ziti is amazing.  I also have to rate the appetizers high.  For fun when I dont' mind going over calories there is fried zuchini and for when I want to be healthy there cut veggies are lovely.  The antipasto salad is a winner!    The one time I had to complain (forgotten ranch dressing for the fried zuchini) they handled it quite well.  So I am a satisfied and returning customer!

Poor service. Waitress with an attitude, manager with lies. Don't come here. I know I will never return. Read my yelps. You'll know I'm open minded n give good reviews when warranted. The service here was so bad I almost cried! Leeka was sullen and ignored me while I was waiting for my car a/c to be fixed nearby. I would've left a fat tip but instead she pulled the whole place down with a bad review, a customer who will never return, and who will also spread word of mouth to others to never go there!

I love Changing Hands Bookstore.  If I could, I would propose.  Oh Changing Hands, run off with me!  I don't know if I could make you as happy as you have made me, but if you would marry me, I would try!  Whenever I'm down, I come over to Changing Hands for a browse.  I also enjoy shopping for presents here, and if you ever had someone who was hard to shop for, this place may have a good chance of solving your problem!    I have many many lovely memories of meeting friends at the adjoining restaurant and then going for a fun browse, meeting up at a table in the back later to compare our "finds".  I have had many great experiences attending readings here, meeting some of my most admired authors and historical figures of all time!  And oh, the yearly customer appreciation book sale!   I have been nurtured as a poet here.  I have seen great local music here.  I have run into old friends and made new friends.  My eyes and my senses are pleases when I enter.  I have given away free books and taken free books from the free book cart in the front.  I have enjoyed patronizing local artists at booths in the front and inside.    Oh Changing Hands, long may you live!  May you triumph over every and any adversary and may you hold up the heads of all your enemies in a long gory chain, unless you find this offensive, in which case, strike that last image!!!

omg Becky, look at the white flour on that pizza... okay not only is this pizza NOT very good, but every time I order on line they mess up my order.  I am so done with you Papa John's.  When I moved I thought well this is the only pizza joint nearby that delivers but I have since found a few others to try.  I only went to you out of inertia. Do NOT, Do NOT try to trick me with the free pizza award for my latest complaint that you gave me extra sauce when I ordered light sauce.  Because i will THROW it away.  I hope I will be giving some other delivery pizza joint a good review soon.

Looking to expand my list of healthy food stores as I continue on my healthy food plan, I went out of my way to this market on Ray and Dobson.  I had mostly good experiences at the Sprouts in Phoenix that I used to go to so although I knew the prices overall were higher than Sunflower, I thought a little variety is good.  I would not recommend this Sprouts to my friends and family.    They short bagged my order and left out vitamins and then did not want to replace the items or give me my money back. They interrogated me, and made me feel like a criminal. I didn't even want to tell him about the busted chalula and my foot being hurt by their bags.  They finally did replace the missing items, but only after making me cry and keeping me from using my phone and taking my drivers license.  I felt threatened and unsafe.   I would say if you go there, double check and make sure all your bags get in your cart, ask for double bagging and if they short your order go back with a big guy as a body guard or something.  They are scary there and they do not take complaints well.  Probably better to avoid them all together.  As for me, I will never return.  I made a complaint to their corporate office, but not let myself in for such treatment again.

I still haven't tried lasers here, but I did a chemical peel and it was awesome.    I also enjoyed the recent makeup workshop and found a great match for my skin tone for foundation.  I wanted to bump them up one for some of the good experiences I have been having here lately.

This store is on my regular shopping route.  I wish they made a store that would combine Trader Joe's, Sunflower Market, and Fresh & Easy, but that is not to be. What F&E has that no one else has: * freshly prepared meals that are low calorie and easy   Otherwise, mostly just a regular grocery store, and with a few speciality orders.  No Chobani yogurt, and the only yogurt they carry that I can eat is Voskos, which is okay, but not my favorite.  Not a great protein bar selection either or cereals that are healthy. No bread that I can eat to speak of.     This means at the bare minimum I still have to go to Sunflower sometimes, and then feel less than happy since Sunflower doesn't have the nice pre-made low cal meals.  Also would like some variety in said meals.  It gets boring to see the same types week after week!  Enough to get mama to cook.  That said, they do have some nice things that are easy to cook.  They also have the lovely Reed's Gingerale, some nice trail mix items, etc.  And it's nice that they have decent kitchen items like paper towels, etc. for those times that I really need to pick up more than just a few meals.  Although they advertise "no high fructose corn syrup" some items DO have corn syrup, so DO READ THE LABELS there if you are avoiding corn syrup!  I'm food -sensitive to corn so I woudl love it if I really had the freedom from corn syrup there, but there are definitely items with corn syrup.  It must not be high fructose, I guess.  that said, I still give them a high rating for easy layout, easy to shop at, clean, pretty good customer service (I rarely have to bag my own even going through self serve, maybe once in a while), and good prices.

Bad service and so so food in a pretentious atmosphere. I had eaten there before a couple of years ago n it was good then. Was downtown for Comicon and I thought it would be a bastion of peace and harmony and good food. The appetizer was good but the pizza was bland and flavorless, greasy and near inedible. You know they told me when I said I didn't like it? "That's our best pizza"! No offering to take any money off or get me anything else.  I was surprised both by the sauce which tasted like it came straight from a tomato sauce can and the amazingly poor service. I left all the pizza there. An overpriced lesson!

First of all, great produce, delicious, fresh and a great selection. Thinking about them makes me hungry!  Secondly, ease of ordering, starting service, and changing orders -- their web site is easy to use.  Thirdly, great attitude, superb customer service.  Highly recommended.

Great ice cream -- very fresh and very creative, fun and delicious.  Always good customer service.  And I noticed they had sorbet and also some healthy ice bars for when I'm ready to be watching my calories again.

My friend and I came in some weeks ago, about end of August after attending a funeral service on that side of town.   The service was overall bad, and the waiter argued with us about the amount of cheese that was on the order from my friend.  So we flagged down the manager to complain.  The result was that he explained that the district manager was there and the ice machine was done. I was like thinking, my friend works in the medical field and has to keep a good customer service attitude when people are throwing up on him, so that explanation didn't seem adequate to me, but oh well, they were going to comp us one slice of pie in addition to the two free slices we ordered from their promotion. When we checked out, it took 1/2 hour to pay the bill, in addition, NO Pieces of Pie were comped out. Explanation -- the types of pie we chose were not in the free offer, although we had asked the server about the time limit on the free pie, I guess he would not let us in on the secret that the TYPES we chose were not free, and now, in addition to NOT getting comped as a nicety for the arguing, we weren't even given ANY free pie at all.  They gave us ONE free $2 iced tea.   And TOOK an extraordinary long time to do this.  We stood outside in the heat and talked after because the atmosphere of bad service inside was so bad, lol. Overall, I would avoid this location.  There are plenty of other restaurant choices nearby when I am on this side of town.

Hi, My Mom said that I could write a review for the doggie day care.  When i first went to this day care I was scared.  I went to two other day cares.  One kept me all night one time because my Mommy was 5 minutes late cuz of her work.  And one was very noisy and I got scared, cuz I'm a little doggie and the people were kind of irtitated and there was a loud noise that Mommy said was a train and no one cared and so I got so scared my Mommy had to come get me and take me home.  When I'm scared by a loud noise at this place they just understand me and don't expect me to be brave.  And Mommy says she likes this doggie day care cuz she can pick me up and drop me off at any time, which works well she says for day care and for travel.  She says the price is right and it helps her buy me more treats.  Whoo hoo.  I like treats a lot.  I love to play with other little doggies and run around like crazy.  They let us stay in a big room with each other so if I want to hide I can hide and rest and if I want to play I can run around like crazy with my friends.  And the humans there are good friends too and they like to pet me.  One is crazy about Chihauhau looking doggies and one remembers me from my first day care.  Of course they love me cuz I'm cute.    I stayed there once for some days when my Mommy said she had to travel.  She said she was having a people vacation and I was having a doggie vacation.  I missed her and my home but a lot of times I was playing so hard I forgot to miss her.  They gave me my same food to eat as I eat at home.  I like food!  It is sooo gooooood!    Sometimes I get my toenails clipped there too.  That makes me feel better!  Mommy says she saves money on that too!  But what I really love is the doggies and playing and running.  I get really tired and it is nice to come home and lie in my little bed or on the couch by mommy and take a nap.  But she sees I like it cuz I get more happy and play more at home too.  She says it makes me more "confident" whatever that means.  I just know I like running with a pack. I have two packs now, my little pack at home with Mommy and that crazy non-dog Kitty Cat thing... and one at doggie day care.  I feel more like a dog now and Mommy says that makes me more healthy.  What I want to know is where are all the treats she promised me with the money she is saving??!??!?!  Also i want to know when do I get to go back!

BEWARE...I was very unhappy with my experience pawning my guitar here.  I just needed some cash to get through as I was changing job and had a delay in my next check.  Well I took in my my guitar in PRISTINE condition and I got it back with a ding in it.  DO NOT PAWN THINGS HERE.   I was horrified.

Recently Dr. Golding pulled my tooth.  He did a great job, was very personable and concerned.  Although I cannot say I enjoyed getting my tooth pulled, it needed to be done!  He was informative, patient, and professional.

I do have to give props to this business for being very good with my timid shy dog.  It's terrible that I have to stop taking her there.  I was delayed from leaving at my job so I called them at 10 til 6 to say I would be there in 15 minutes.  The owner said if I couldn't make it any faster, they would have to keep my dog and board her.  Unfortunately my cat had died Friday so as I slowly sadly drove home I realized I really wanted my dog.  I had paid the owner in advance for 4 days so I went to her and begged her for my dog, as I am still grieving my lost cat.  I told her she could keep all the money but she said it wasn't about money.  I then realized sadly that although they are awesome with my doggie we will have to stop coming because I cannot guarantee I will never be 5 minutes late, especially with my job.  I believe that a service like this, used by working adults, should have some arrangement that works for when you have to work late.  Otherwise they are a good boarder and doggie day care, just whatever you do DO NOT WORK LATE.  In my job that is impossible to avoid. I also felt she was very unforgiving about it.  I wish she had said, come and get your dog, but never do it again, then at least I could be sitting here with my dog instead of her being sad in the boarding facility overnight for the sin of her owner being held hostage in a meeting.....In the meantime, I will be looking on yelp at the other doggie day cares to find one with a more lenient day care policy and I am going to let this day care provider keep my little extra money, as they have really broken my heart.

I had taken some belly dance, but in a much smaller setting.  I am overweight and older, so I was nervous to try a new belly dance class venue, but Plaza de Anaya is great!  Very welcoming of all levels of students, with a great dance floor, excellent instructors and a strong community feeling.  Now I'm addicted.  I can tell this is a great place for the more advanced dancers as well, and they host workshops with famous dancers from around the country.  Highly recommended!

I attend this fitness center for belly dance classes and haven't tried any of their other fitness classes, but I do love Sherry Fregoso their belly dance instructor (who also teaches other classes btw).  The studio has different sized rooms and so they schedule the classes based on attendence with is clever.  The rooms are great!  The studio is clean and has a friendly feel.  The studio worked with me when I needed a refund and all my communications with them were professional and pleasant.  I continue to return for belly dance whenever I can and have recommended it to other students.  I also may someday get brave enough to try another type of class there; you never know.... but for now, I appreciate their scheduling (online) and prices (reasonable).

Got a Groupon for a combined 2 hour treatment for a massage and a foot reflexology treatment. I put 10:30 down in my calendar for this and I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be at 10:30 because I remembered thinking we would be going over the noon lunch hour, but that the therapist must take lunch late or something. My only question when i saw the 10:30 later on my calendar was maybe it was 11 a.m. not 10:30 a.m. but I went in at 10:30 anyway so that I could fill out any forms and if I was early I would just work on my lists of things to do or read while I waited. Got in and they said they had me down at 9;30!?!??!?!  So They did say well we could do one of the services now and do the other one at another day. The therapist insisted on playing tinny sounding music on her smart phone speakers while she gave me a massage. The massage wasn't the best I had ever had.  The room was decorated well but the massage bed was substandard.  I reflected it was odd that they would spend money on iron candle scounces instead of a decent sound system or a decent massage table. I decided to never go back, cause I don't really want reflexology from someone who cannot do a massage well.

Was very sorry that my first (and last) experience with this business was so bad.  Although somewhat amusing!    Summary: Pizza driver baked more than Pizza was!  Pizza delivered 2 hours late!  My friend and I were staying up late Sunday night so we could catch up as she was visting from out of town.  She suggested pizza so everyone else being closed at 11 p.m., I decided to try Oliveo's as I had a flyer from them....  So at 11:15 p.m. we ordered our pizza.  They told us it would be 45 minutes, a standard amount of time for a delivery.  We were pretty hungry, but we also hadn't seen each other for a long time and got engrossed in conversation.  So about 12:30 we both realize that the pizza hasn't gotten there yet.  So at 12:35, according to my phone, I called Oliveo's to find out what was going on.  I got a pretty grumpy person who informed me they were short staffed with only two people and that my pizza was on its way but he couldn't really tell me when I would get it.  About 12:37, the driver, who sounded pretty stoned in my opinion, called and told me he was sorry to inform me that my pizza was going to be 15 minutes late.  So i said drive safely, but we are starving!  He told me that there was one house ahead of mine and explained they only had two people working and they had "run out of pizza".  WTF, LOL... he he the pizza place RAN OUT OF PIZZA... lol... that cracked us up.  About 1:30 a.m.  he finally arrived and gave us a cold pizza and our pasta we ordered.  So the order was "only" two hours late.  After he left my friend and I burst out laughing our **sses off because the driver WAS FULLY BAKED.  No, really his EYES were like LARGER than his head.  We hadn't seen any one that stoned for quite some time, ourselves having changed our own wild ways some time back....  The pizza was cold but tasty and the pasta was rather tasty too, but in all honesty I can never order from this place again, sadly.  2 hours late is WAY too late, the first guy I talked to on the phone was short with me and unpolite, the stoned driver was very easy going (lol) but no one offered us any rebate of cost or coupons or anything to make up for this extraordinarily bad customer service.    I would generalyl call the place during the day to talk to them about it, but we were busy having one last little bit of time together before i took her to the airport and now my work week started, so sorry to yelp you without calling you Oliveo's, but really, in my opinion this was so poor that I feel fine about not really giving you prior warning of my poor review.    Also how can you "run out of pizza"... (still lmao!)

I went to Dr. Golding to have my tooth pulled recently. Also met with Dr. Sabol who checked to see how the temporary prostetic I had was fitting so I can continue the healing.  I got a bone graft and am going to go back to this office to get a tooth implant.    The front office staff is friendly.  The office is modern, clean, and well appointed.  They have a Kuerig machine and offer water or other beverages.  They helped me by calling my friend to pick me up after the tooth was pulled.  Although I had to come back twice to get the healing of the tooth checked, I found the front staff patient, helpful, and pleasant.  Every staff member I dealt with was professional and kind.  Both doctors were also patient, helpful and professional.  I would recommend this practice to those who need/want oral or facial surgery.  I also had to call in about a question after the tooth was pulled and it was off hours.  The doctor on call called me back right away, answered all my questions patiently and helped me out quite a bit with all my concerns.  The only problem I had was with their answering service who scheduled my first appointment with them as a consultation when I clearly asked the woman on the phone to schedule it as my tooth getting pulled.  Luckily the front desk was able to change it so my tooth got pulled rather than having to wait longer!  And they were very nice about it.
