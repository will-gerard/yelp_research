Let's be real. Its Boston Market. They aren't reinventing the wheel.  But the food came out hot and fresh tasting. And the service was super friendly.  Theresa anticipated my needs and the line worked fast.  If anything, I'd come back here for the service and its clean. Those two things alone make it 4 stars when compared to other fast casuals.

Really into this spot. Reminds me of a classic NYC deli. Sandwiches are tasty and the space is cozy.  The service is really friendly.. I recommend the tall lean Texan.

Its a dry cleaner. I dont have any laundry list of expectations. As long as my stuff comes back pressed and clean im pretty pleased. So far, i have no complaints. Its a little pricey, but the way i see it, im paying for convienice of location. Id recommend them if youre in the neighborhood and dont want to drive a couple miles more to save a few bucks.

Drinks on point.  Good fantastic.  Ambiance wonderful.  Service was excellent - can be a little to formal, but I holding them back.  Great spot.  Owners should be proud of their business. Will go back and tell others.

Meh.   Ambiance was drab. Server was cold and im pretty sure didnt smile once. Food wasnt great and kinda overpriced for what it was. Cocktails were ok.   Coming from new york, ive had better top to bottom. Probably wont go again. But id suggest it to someone if they wanted to experiment.   Id recommend the kimchi though. That was super tasty.

Went here a few years ago when it was more tapas style for dinner and thought it was ok.  But now that ive relocated to phx went back to try the brunch.   Let me start with - i really enjoy Gallo Blanco. Id say that spot is one of those restaurants you can always go to and be satisfied. So i like the pedigree that Otro comes from.   Two words describes my experience: amateur hour.   Went with a party of 8. Called ahead and when we got there the restaurant was maybe half full.  Server didnt seem with it.  For example. A majority of us ordered coffee. We would finish. Then one of us would ask for a refill. He would then refill the one cup, then disappear.  Why didnt he ask if anyone else needed more? Another example. One of our party oreered hot tea. Brought a dirty mug. Told him - honest mistake - came back with a copper mug for a moscow mule.  Welp. Hot drink. Copper cup. Not possible to hold. That information didnt really register with him when we tried to explain.  He was more focused on the fact that it was clean.   Anyways. We ordered chilaquiles and tortas and pancakes and huevos rancheros. Literally took 45 minutes.  Pancake came out undercooked and room temp. Not to mention a sad spot where a pad of butter USED to be.  Huevos rancheros also room temp. Side of beans were hard crusted on top. Basically tells me it was sitting in the window for awhile. The chilaquiles were fine. Torta was ok.   Overall a dissappointing experience. Server was more work for us. Food was a bummer.   Oh well. I dont recommend this place.

Once i heard the story (maybe it isnt true) about this place and that they were fans of mission chinese is san fran and nyc i had to give it a try. Coming from nyc i was craving some great metropolitan asian food.   The ambiance was nice. The building itself looks pretty cool.   Service was good. The bartender and cocktails were awesome. Id say some of the best cocktails ive ever had.   Food. Also good. Solid. I had the pork ramen - something ive been craving - and it didnt disappoint. Only thing i think could have bee better was the meat cut to be a little less 'tough' i guess. Also had the pork face dumplinga - excellent. And the grilled octopus - also tasty.   Overall id definitely recommend to others and go back.
