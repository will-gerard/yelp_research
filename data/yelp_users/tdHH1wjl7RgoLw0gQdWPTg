I purchased the WE Vibe 3 and I'm sorely disappointed with it.  It cost $150, which was rather expensive!!!!  It is an absolute waste of money.  Not powerful enough.  Partner didn't care for it and it is useless .  I've been to the Shea store, the Oak & Scottsdale store beside the Northsight store.  We have been pushed into purchasing items that have been no use to us, and the employees don't know have enough knowledge about sex in general as they are just young kids.  The gals are just trying to move stock.

The nurses do not seem to be happy working there and it shows in their attitudes.  Avoid Donald Day if you can.  He claims he is a Christian, however I doubt it.  Dr. Hindosh, one of the hospitalist, could sure work on his people skills.  I contracted MRSA after a surgery there and was back for a week to treat that.  Unfortunately, I have to go back to this hospital to get a massive tumor removed.  This time I will ask for a patient advocate.  There are no good hospitals.  Just make sure you have a good Doc.  And ask questions!  Keep asking until you get an answer.  The food at this place is really exceptional.

Please avoid this shop!.  They sold me inferior vapor -Evod Mini Protank 2, which never worked properly.  I was refused proper help, and the guys who work there have no knowledge about anything and could care less.  High turnover rate of employees..  Waste of my money, will try Hot Box Smoke Shop.  Mary, the owner is never available.  Do NOT go there, period. Very disappointing experience and I lost $40.00.  Received no compensation.  Must throw product out! I would have given it zero stars!
