I don't know why this place only has a 3 star average review. My boyfriend and I came here at 9:20 pm (40 mins before closing). I didn't feel rushed or like the staff was trying any less to give us a great experience.   The inside is so cute! This is a very well put together restaurant. The inside looks as if it were an old hotel, turned into a restaurant. Lots of cute decor and signs everywhere.  The food was good! Not the best in town, but definitely a great deal for the prices and for being a downtown restaurant. The cocktail I ordered was so-so, but good enough to wear I didn't feel like it was a waste of money. I really enjoyed this place and it was great for a quick make shift date for my boyfriend and I!

This place was excellent! I had Chrystal do my nails. They took me as a last minute appointment which I was really grateful for and everyone was really sweet. Even though I was there until closing, I did not feel like I was being rushed or anything. I love my nails and I am very happy :)   I don't live in Scottsdale and don't go to Scottsdale very often, I was just in the area so I decided to go there. But, I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area!  ***p.s. This is one of the prettiest nails spas I've been too. Everything looks so clean and inviting :)

I went to Mor after basically being screwed over by a different furniture company. I was in and out of here within 30 mins with the couch of my dreams, thanks to Tim! I couldn't be happier with the service and the same day delivery :)

I came in almost a year ago to get a couch that I am still in love with so when I needed a recliner I thought I'd come in again because I had such great customer service last time. Well Tim was not there this time but Jon was and he did a GREAT job. I found a recliner that was perfect for me and you really can't beat the price!! I love this place and it will be my number once choice to go to whenever I need any new furniture!! This place deserves 10 stars!

If you want a quick and easy oil change, this may not be the place for you. The staff is really nice, pretty helpful. I had made an appointment for an oil change and an AC performance check, because they said they were too busy to take my car as a "walk in". A little annoying but I get that they get busy.   When I went in for my appointment, they took me right away. I then walked to a near by Starbucks to wait for my car. After about an hour they called me telling the parts I needed for my AC and asked if I wanted it fixed. They said it would take about another hour to finish. After an hour, I hadn't received a call from them. So I walked back to check on my car (at this point they had had my car for about 3 hours). When I got there, they said that my part for my car had just came in and it would be another couple of hours wait. The only problem is that I had a different appointment that I had to leave for. (I thought 4 hours would be sufficient time).   They, in the end, didn't charge me for the AC but asked me to come back on a different day to finish it. So, not the worst service, my car is running better. But not the quickest service either. I underestimated how much work needed to be done. I will go back, because they did a good job, I just wish their communication was a LITTLE bit better. Overall pretty good!

I have had good and bad experiences here. But lately I have only had good ones! I always like the outcome of my nails and I think that lately they have really been trying to improve their customer service! I think that it is really important that you give them a clear image of what you are wanting with your nails or else they tend to just do "their own way" if you don't tell them exactly what you want. But overall, I am very pleased :)

This place was great! First time I've used animal boarding and they even sent pics via text of my two dogs. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful! I felt very safe and relieved to leave my pets with them!

They really need to work on being more efficient. The girl at the register took over 5 minutes to ring up just my order, I ordered one drink only. And then when I received my drink it was overflowing and I had to clean it up...I understand being busy, but they were really frustrating.
