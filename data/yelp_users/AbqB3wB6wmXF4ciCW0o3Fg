Let me preface this review by stating that I've only ordered take out. With that, China Chili is my go to place for those days where I don't feel like cooking and want a quick meal. It's the best mom and pop Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.  I'm a strict vegetarian, and China Chili has been very accommodating. I'd recommend the Hunan Style Tofu with no chicken.   I'm not a big holiday person, so I'm looking forward to spending Thanksgiving and Christmas here.

Alyssa did a great job with customer service, A+! Also, kudos to these guys for staying cool under the pressure of Black Friday.

I'm not sure why this location has such a low review score. I live about halfway between this store and the 44th and Thomas location. I've always had a great experience here. The staff is very helpful and answers all of my questions without being condescending.   Tonight I was assisted by Kirk in gardening and he was so passionate and knowledgable that it totally made my night and has inspired me to do more gardening.  Also, this location is far less crowded than 44th and Thomas!

The store itself is fine, but Golam just started screaming at me because there was a rate discrepancy and his computer wasn't working. I'm sorry you were having a bad day, but not yelling at your customers is customer service 101.

I'm not sure how you could leave a 1-star review for a store that donates the majority of its sales to Hospice. Hospice took great care of my mother in her final days. I recently moved into a house and was looking for some new furniture. White Dove has a great, ever changing selection (keep an eye out for discounts, too!) and the staff is very kind and helpful. If you're thrifting on Melrose, be sure to check this place out and support a great cause while doing so.

This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced at a dealership. I understand that I'm setting the bar low here, since it rarely goes well and it's usually stressful, but Right Honda brought it to a whole new level.   Dropping off the car went fine. The shuttle driver was ready almost immediately and I was able to get to work on time.   The issues popped up as soon as it was time to get my car. I asked how long it would be to have the shuttle pick me up from two miles away. The driver told me he would be there in 20-25 minutes. I called an hour later to ask for a status update. He claimed he would be there in 5 minutes, as someone in the background kept saying in a very bratty voice "no you won't, no you won't." Wow, how unprofessional!   5 minutes turned into 20 minutes and he called to say he had arrived. I mentioned that I had overheard his conversation and I caught him off guard. All he had to say was "oh, that was...about something else." A likely story. He didn't apologize for keeping me waiting, either.  I told the service cashier and manager about this, but nobody cared. Go ahead and let your employees behave like spoiled high school kids, you'll continue losing customers, and the rest of us won't have to worry about it.   Go to Earnhardt Honda if you have time. My experience was like night and day there. Right Honda was a massive waste of time and money.  Also, it doesn't take too much effort to properly wash a car. Put down your phones and pay attention when a customer is in front of you.

Great customer service. My cat refused to eat the various petsmart wet food brands I tried out. She devoured the first can of raw food I brought home upon the store's recommendation.

I would probably go here daily if I lived nearby. Lola is a great spot to relax and get some work done. I stopped by this morning while waiting for my dry cleaning next door and was impressed by the prompt service, even on a busy morning. I hate to admit it, but the Starbucks drive-thru is usually my go to morning coffee stop, but this morning's trip to Lola proved to me that it's worth taking a little more time for a better product. My caramel latte, blueberry scone, and bell pepper quiche were all magnificent, and the kicker was it took far less time than the "convenient" Starbucks drive-thru!   I'd also recommend stopping by when you have no time constraints. Lola's cappuccinos are quite lovely.

Holy cow, this place is great and very accommodating for vegetarians and vegans. The poblano quesadilla was incredible. Be sure to hit up the salsa bar and order some horchata, you won't regret it!

Like everyone else, I consistently encounter terrible service here. I'm now 3 for 3 with my drink orders getting messed up. You're better off going to the Starbucks at 7th St and Osborn. It's worth the extra drive- you're going to be waiting in line 10+ minutes here regardless of how busy it is.   Bonus- on my second trip here, the employees were having a fight and screaming at each other. Keep it classy!

This is by far my favorite fresh Mex spot in Phoenix. I used to go here all of the time when I lived in the North Valley. I still make it a point to stop by anytime I'm in the area.   The restaurant is set up much like Chipotle- there's an assembly line with multiple clerks working on your order. You tell them what you want, and they assemble a huge burrito for you. The only down side is you're charged for specialty items like green chiles, but it is so worth it.   My big veggie burrito costs about $7 and is perfect before an afternoon nap.   Here is my go to order-  Veggie burrito with green chiles, chipotle barbeque sauce, rice, black beans, corn, mild salsa, ranch dressing, and maybe some mango salsa if I'm feeling feisty.   Cafe Rumba is definitely worth checking out if you are near the Arrowhead area!

I have many tattoos from many different artists, and Golden Rule is my go to spot. I've been very happy with work by Honest Bob Gibson and Jason Anthony. Take a look at the artists' portfolios to see what style you like.  You really can't go wrong here!

This is my favorite place to go when I'm in a hurry for lunch. Ordering ahead on the app saves a ridiculous amount of time. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I wish they had a tip jar, because the customer service has always been exceptional here. The Greyhawk Chipotle is now my go to place to relax and read during my lunch hour.  Be warned, though- if you don't use the app, the lines get pretty long.

Most of my previous experiences here have been pleasant, but an employee named Annie just earned them a negative review.  I asked to try on a pair of cute Star Wars panties. I forgot that you aren't allowed to take them in the fitting room. No problem, the first associate told me that, and I accepted it. Annie butted in and said very loudly and maliciously, "we don't carry 2XL."   I wasn't asking for a larger size, but thanks for the fat shaming and congrats on losing a sale.

Kitten Retro Glamour is the best shopping experience you'll have in the valley. Pimms and her staff are wonderful and make shopping fun. Everyone is always smiling and eager to make their customers happy without the pressure of making a sale. Going here is like playing dress up- see a unique design? Try it on. See something that looks odd and that you know you won't purchase, but you're curious to see how it looks anyway? Try it on, you may be surprised.   The clothing is adorable and there's always something new to be found. I love that the store includes jewelry and accessories from local artists. Be sure to check out the handmade dessert necklaces!  The first time I checked out Kitten, I was at the Melrose location. While I was shopping, a trans woman walked in the store and Pimms greeted her with the same enthusiasm as all of her other customers. The woman tried on a few outfits and Pimms clapped her hands with excitement and made her feel welcome. Kitten does not discriminate and embraces everyone. I already loved the clothes and the shopping experience, but seeing Pimms interact with the trans community made me a fan for life.   Yes, the clothes can be pricey, but bear in mind that this is a boutique that carries clothes from all over the world. The prices are comparable to a site like Modcloth, Sourpuss, Pin Up Girl Clothing, etc., but you are able to try on the clothes in the store and don't have to deal with pesky shipping fees.   Better yet, Kitten carries a variety of sizes, from XS to 3X! Vintage sizing can be a pain, but the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. If your size is not available or out of stock, the staff goes the extra mile to special order what you need  It's impossible to walk out of Kitten without an air of confidence and without catching Pimms' contagious smile. Kitten Retro Glamour is an absolute must for fans of all things vintage, pretty, and kitsch!

Mattress shopping is a colossal pain in the rear, but Tuft & Needle makes it fun and easy. The staff is friendly and eager to answer questions (free soft drinks were a plus!). I bought a queen bed for $600, which was a great deal. I put it on top of an Ikea bed frame and love the drawers I have under my bed. I've had the mattress for four months now and have no complaints. It may be a little firm for some, but I hear that adding a mattress pad solves a lot of those problems.  At check out, staff helped me lug the box into the front seat of my tiny car. Set up was super easy- but make sure that you unwrap your mattress on top of your bedframe, because it is a bit more cumbersome to move once it has been unwrapped. The mattress kind of looks like a maxi pad when it is first unwrapped, which is funny.  If I am ever in the market for another mattress, I'll definitely get another Tuft & Needle!

Between this place, Mad Greens, and Whole Foods, North Scottsdale has a ton of salad options. I got the Herban Cowboy, and the staff had no problem substituting chicken for tofu. The salad was fresh and delicious, and I grabbed a hummus box for later.   I loved the presentation! These trays are adorable, and the cold brew tea was delicious.

Fantastic new bar in Phoenix. Go on Monday nights to play games for free. Fridays and Saturdays get busy very fast, arrive early and kick your friends' butts at Jenga and pinball!

Wow, I've never had such a great experience shopping for glasses! I was browsing on my own and 3 different associates asked if I needed help. Cynthia helped me narrow down my choices to a few different frames. The prices are good and it was a very low pressure sales situation. The customer service is magnificent, I'd highly recommend stopping by and trying on tons of glasses. You can't do that online, so go have fun!

Great product, but painfully slow service. Maybe it will improve once the staff has more experience on the job? Don't come here if you're in a hurry.
