I normally love Keegans.   I especially love the Keegans on Ray and 48th street; great food and service!!! I just recently heard about the Camelback location's remodel. I had previously been there and it needed a face lift. Tonight I went in with ym family. The atmosphere looks amazing... Great job with the remodel! However, I had really a really poor experience. My dad arrived first and a male server came over to greet him (he ordered a beer and water). Then I arrived... No one came over for like 10 minutes. Then my mom arrived and still no one for about another 5-8 minutes. I flagged down another server and told her we needed our server. She looked at me all shocked, and said "Oh, ok Ill try and find who it is". Not a very professional response. Anyway, we finally get another girl, who was very sweet, and she said she'd be helping us. As she was getting our drinks the male server finally returned, didn't address us, but asked our "new server" to just take the table and passed her my dad's beer... Really unprofessional. We ended up having great service with our new server. The only other thing that bothered me, was that I ordered the taproom steak sandwich. I have had this several times over the years at all 3 locations. Tonight I got it and it looked like half the normal portion! What happened Keegan's did we skim back? It was literally 2 small steaks (maybe 1.5lbs each instead of the normal 3lbs each). I just think that's really skimpy for a $14 dollar meal. I hope this is helpful criticism because I do love the Keegan's restaurants and normally have good service. I was just really disappointed tonight and thought you needed to know!

I am really disappointed with the service and experience I had with this David's Bridal. Today I went in for shoes for my bridesmaids and the help I received was interrupted and just bad. They only had 3 of the 7 sizes I needed and when I asked questions regarding ordering them, their future shipments, etc. I got "unsure answers". I was frustrated but understood them not having all the sizes I needed. When I pressed for how I was going to obtain them, she never offered helpful information. It was only after I asked do other stores ship them to your location? No. Are you getting more in? Not sure. If other stores have them and I cannot drive there is there an option? It will be $15 to get them shipped per shoe/store. This was not great information or service. She gave me a list of a few locations that had some of the sizes but did not offer to call them to confirm. I left feeling unimpressed.  Later, I called the stores she gave me and 2 of them did not have the sizes in stock that I was told. Now, I work in retail so I know your onhands can sometimes be off, but this disappointment could have been halted if she would have called to verify herself. I finally got a very helpful, friendly associate at the Avondale location (Jessica) and she did not have the shoes either (like the first associate said again) but she gave me options right away. She confirmed that she could ORDER the shoes and get them shipped to my closest location or to my house. An option I never heard from the Tatum location! I was happy to do this, and I even paid the one time $15 dollar fee to get them shipped to my house to avoid going back to the Tatum location and dealing with that horrible service. When Jessica was processing my order, she even made a remark that they didn't fill out any of my information correctly in the system and had to do a whole profile with me over the phone; even though I had been to the Tatum location twice (and purchased items both times).   I wasn't going to put the employees name that helped me because I did not want to be rude, but please ensure management revisits training and what great service looks like with the employees working today, Saturday. I am not looking forward to picking up the shoes I already ordered... I hope I have a better experience then.

We love going to this location. We started going more often because the food was great and we were getting awesome service. We especially like sitting at the bar with two of the regular guy bar tenders. I think its CJ/Casey and I forget the other dark haired bartenders name, but they rock. We will continue to go back!

We got take out from here, not expecting the best Chinese food in the world, but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it, and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!

My boyfriend and I go to Fatso's all the time! At first we were hesitant because of the name, but they won us over! It's my favorite local pizza and the servers are like family. We enjoy the live music too. We're fans of the Hawaiian pizza and the Carnivore pizza. Worth checking out...

I have been going to this Massage Envy for over a year now, and I keep coming back. I love how comfortable I feel and of course the massages are great. The front of the house staff is always very friendly and I often see them cleaning when they have down time. I see Janet regularly and she is the best. I have seen other massage therapists when she is off or booked and I have never had a bad experience. Check them out!

My fiance and I had an amazing experience with Marianne at Shane Co. We went in to just look at rings in April, not sure if we'd feel pressured or intimidated. It was such a great experience. We were both nervous as it was, but we were helped by Marianne right when we walked in. We explained to her that we were just looking at settings so my boyfriend could surprise me later with something we both loved. She patiently took us through every case, letting me look at every setting I was interested in. At the end she let me see a diamond in our price range in the setting and of course I fell in love. She offered us an option of a deposit and/or gave us the info for another time.   In August my boyfriend finally popped the question, but little to my knowlegde he was partnering with Marianne the whole time. She kept in contact with him through phone and email and helped him every step of the way. He said she was so great to work with. We both recommend Shane Co for it's amazing products and service!

The only reason I even gave Macy's 2 stars was because I was able to find the shoes I was looking for for $10 cheaper than Dillard's... Today they were really busy in the shoe department with only 2 people working. Now, I am a store manager and I know how stressful it can get when it's busy but today was not handled well. The employees were friendly but chaotic (Tom and Michael). Tom kept taking phone calls, processing orders over the phone and it felt like he was doing everything he could to avoid the line of ladies that needed assistance with shoes. Michael was nice, scambling to help everyone, however it took him 30 minutes to even call for assistance. He kept saying a manager is on their way, a manager is on their way... It took the manager forever to get there and still only 1 out of the 12 were being helped. Once the manager finally got there she started ringing ou the guests which was nice and apologized to everyone. The only other thing that bpthered me was that there was a women who was clearly fanning herself because she was so hot that she was about to faint.. There was some sort of mix up with her getting the "family/friend discount" for Wednesday at a cheaper rate, but Michael didn't explain it well enough so she thought she was walking out wih her shoes today. She was about to faint and he was telling her she couldn't have them and she was getting very upset because she had paid for them. As a manager in retail this was an easy, override it and do what's right for the guest, but he wasn't going to. He told her he'd have to see what the manager said. The manager ringing me up didn't even acknowledge the situtation which was very strange and then suddenly another manager walked up and he was finishing saying to the guest "Well I would need a manager to aprove but if you don't tell other guests then maybe this acception is ok". I just laughed out loud, really??? Anyway, the other manager got the situation explained to her (while this lady is still about to pass out, fanning herself) and the manager said no she couldn't take them home. They all went back and forth for a little while and then finally the manager said it was ok to take her shoes, she paid for, home. Thank goodness in the end that she got to take them home and didn't faint right there... But it took over an hour to make this whole situtaion right.. Very poor, unorganized, not staffed well, horrible Macy's experience.

Great place!!! I have been taking my two dogs here for the last 4 years! We always see Jane for grooming! We have not yet tried their boarding services but will in the future when we need it. Jane is so amazing with our kids (pups) and she really makes you feel at ease. She takes time to learn their personalities, always asks us what we like and we have never had an issue with their cuts or experience! I was a little neverous bringing our small dogs to a cage free grooming with other large dogs out, but they have never had any issues and tend to make a lot of friends. Jane also reassured us, in the beginning that if she needs to cage up a pup for any reason she will but it's a wonderful environment. So if you have small dogs do not worry!

I just wanted to add to my review because the staff and management at Bluewater Grill were so amazing when helping my fiance plan his prosal to me at their restaurant! We have also loved Bluewater Grill for our go-to date place when we crave seafood, and we have always been curious about the upstairs area. A few months ago we found out they were renivating the upstairs area for events, rehearsals, etc., and we had joked about having our rehearsal dinner there in the future. Well, to my surprise my fiance and his friend partnered with the manager about setting up the proposal upstairs alone, then having a party for me with my close family and friends in the bar afterwards. They even had our favorite service come in and serve us. They were so amazing!   Thanks Bluewater grill and thanks to Rachel our fav server!

I had such a great experience at Uptown Bridal today! I have been down with my venue going into foreclosure (Inspirador) and being out thousands of dollars, but today was just what I needed. Ali was amazing- made me feel so comfortable and so sweet. I found my dress and I actually was able to buy the sample gown that fit like a glove, and get % off! They also were so sweet and the owner gave me a $100 credit toward any accessory in the store for my trouble with Inspirador. I was able to walk out with my dress today and order the perfect veil. I will also be back from bridesmaid dresses because of the amazing service and getting 10% off for my girls since I purchased a dress. Thank you Ali and team!

I finally found my local nail place, that I actually enjoy returning to! They are always so friendly and clean! I have never had any issues. I have had to wait before due to the business but they always quote times correctly, and they take reservations too.

We had passed this place on our way to the gym a few times and we finally tried it... And are we sure glad we did! This place was great; very small but nice and clean. Carlos was very helpful and took care of us. We went with what he recommended; tamales. I had the sweet corn topped with pork and chicken tamales, and my fiancé had the chicken and the beef tamales. Everything was amazing! We were almost too stuffed to try an Empanada, but Carlos brought us one to try. It was the best Empanada I have ever had. We tried the pineapple and cream, which was heated and topped with a little bit of powdered sugar and Carmel. We will definitely be back. We found out on our way out that you can bring your own wine or beer and there is just a corking fee. What a fun place and we will definitely be coming back!

I wanted to let everyone know what an amazing help Care was to me and my fiancé during a difficult time. I originally booked Inspirador and after their horrible customer care and foreclosure, I was out of a venue, cater, DJ and about $8,000! Care Schmidt offered me her services for free to me to help save my Big Day. She jumped right in and made magic happen. She got offers from some of the top venues in Arizona after she reached out and told them our situation. She was in constant communication with me and helped me narrow everything down. After months of planning, decisions and questions I am finally set up for success on my Big Day. I would recommend Care for wedding planning and services to anyone. Her contact info is: Care Schmidt,   480.234.1336, www.SterlingEventDesign.com

So, I really wanted to like this place. We live like 5 minutes away and were excited to support a small business, however we have had horrible service. We have given it 3 chances and all 3 times poor service, cold food and flies flying by the windows. The first time in the server told us she was tired and the food was ok. We then tried it a few weeks later, with friends and our server was nice but randomly brought me a refill and said "Don't worry I'm not dirty". We were silent because this was a very weird thing to say... and randomly. She then said "I didn't want you to see pen marks on my arms and worry I was serving you while dirty it's just busy". We all were polite and said no you're fine but couldn't help but joke about that after- who says that? Today we went back with the same couple and we had the server we had our first time in. She was rude, barely spoke to us, slow to refill empty drinks and my fiancé had cold hash browns. We will not be returning- Sorry gave it 3 tries.

I absolutely love this nail salon. I previously went to Ken's nails and spa, but the new owners and employees are great. I especially love Sion and Tammy. Every time I go, I am treated so friendly and always have a great experience. I love the deluxe pedicure and I usually go back and forth with gel manicures and pink and white full sets. They are very reasonably priced. I will never go anywhere else!!!  I also got married in February and I arranged a morning for all my bridesmaids and my mom and I, with the owner Jason. He was great and had enough staff to get every pedicure chair open and then switch over to our hands. I felt so special! Thank you!

OMG, this is my new favorite place! It was so nice to get a modern, fun, great food restaurant in the neighborhood. My husband and I love going for lunch and happy hour. The atmosphere is so cute and the $5.99 pizzas on Tuesday is such a fun idea. We continue to bring our friends and come back!  A couple of items we love are the bruschetta boards and the margarita pizza! I definitely recommend it!!!
