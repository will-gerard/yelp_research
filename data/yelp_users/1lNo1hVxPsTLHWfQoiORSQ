Love this quaint little place. The owner is the sweetest Frenchmen I've met. I stopped in on a rainy morning and had a spinach quiche. Great little place. He told me on Saturday they have special dinners and a Dj. Will be back!!

When I walked in the gentleman told me to pick any chair. So I did then he asked me to move. I waited about 10 mins until someone came over. She was very sweet and very old. Not that there is anything wrong with that however she was not taking her time like the others. She finished my Pedi in 30 mins. The calus remover was an additional $5 which I usually don't mind paying however she maybe scrubbed my feet maybe 5 times. I also asked for the sugar scrub which was oil and sugar scrub. Again not worth it. The foot massage lasted 5 minutes. So after paying $40 I would have much rather have gone to pink polish!!!!

One word for this place is well two....the best!!!! I have seen all of the doctors and you cannot go wrong with any of them. I am now seeing Dr. Edwards bc she was the one that got me thru my first time putting my first dog down. The true love, compassion, and sympathetic she gave me and my dog is something you cannot get anywhere else!!! She also sent out a card to me that was so meaningful wasn't just of BS. They don't pressure you with oh you need this or you have to have this done. They give you what you need plain and simple no sugar coating!!! Prices....are great. I left another vet where I was paying $200 just to walk thru the door not here. I mean I could go on and on about this place. If you are looking for a fancy place this isn't it. This place is a vet with loving and caring people who work there and very down to earth! Wouldn't go anywhere else!

Desperate need of some TLC. Went here on a Tuesday afternoon. My mom had an egg salad sandwich and it was completely bland. I had a Reuben with I have no clue what was on top a salad? Coleslaw? Lettuce with mustard? There was minimal sauerkraut and Swiss cheese on the bottom and no 1000 island dressing. To say the least  it was the saddest most pitiful Reuben I've had. My son had some oily bread with half melted cheese on it. Oh and the chips we all had.....I wonder if they are the ones from 1958...again we all almost chipped a tooth. Of course all the desserts were yummy. This is could be so cute as it once was however it needs one hell of a remodel. Especially the bathrooms and children's play center. It has such a great location in Scottsdale and lots of memories for families it's a shame to see that it's gone down hill. To the older gentlemen standing in the corner with his arms crossed with the white hair & glasses. Please stop being creepy standing there staring at everyone.....if you're a manager then manage or help our your staff. I will not be back.   Please give the sugar bowl the love and attention it needs and deserves!!

Sliced BBQ Chicken Meat Plate  Tonight I was in the mood for some real good BBQ food; Joe's Real BBQ it was.  I arrived on a Friday night around 7:30. It was a perfect night for BBQ. I parked across the street. When walking up to the restaurant you could see a big neon sign which was right above the door "Joe's Real BBQ". The smell of pecan wood chips filled the air and the smell of BBQ poured through the door as I opened them. I waited in line for about 15 minutes. Half way through the line a small cute older woman offered me a menu. As I got to the front of the line I grabbed my tray, silverware, and a black cherry soda for me. A young gentleman asked me what I wanted. I ordered sliced BBQ chicken plate with potato salad and macaroni n cheese. I paid with my debit card and was on my way to enjoy some BBQ. Through the doors I entered the patio area. I saw stringed lights hanging from all the trees. I sat down on a park bench on the patio. I dove into my dinner plate. I grabbed some bread, hot BBQ sauce, and my pecan smoked BBQ chicken. It was so delicious. The chicken was so moist and cooked just to order. Joe's offers these chopped pickled onions. They were so delicious with the bread and chicken. The black cherry soda washed down the BBQ perfectly. The potato salad that came with my dinner plate was also tasty. The potato salad wasn't really cold to me.  The mac n cheese came along with my dinner plate. I was definitely disappointed with it. It had some bread crumbs sprinkled on top. It was lukewarm and a little bland. However I ate it and enjoyed it. The best part of dinner was definitely the BBQ chicken. As I sad and listened to old country music and children running around playing. I savored my meal and enjoyed the spring night. I will be returning for some "real BBQ" thanks to Joe's. Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did!

Eric and Ryan ce to my house. The were earlier than expected which was fine with me. These two were quite the pair! Let's me honest here...my carpets were despicable, atrocious, unimaginable! They came in and looked over my carpets and decided what was the best plan for me. Then the cleaning began! The magic before my eyes was unbelievable. I honestly couldn't believe what was happening. I went from having beige carpets to having poppin white ones! It's truly amazing. They took me room by room and asked me to ensured that the room was ok and cleaned enough.   I honestly couldn't say enough about them. I would go into the technical stuff of the cleaning solutions but I don't remember the names and how they work and the names. However I know there aren't any chemicals and it was a VERY though job. There was at least 4 steps vs one a the other carpet guys do.   Hire them! You can't go wrong!

I love this place. Every time I come here I get shredded beef chimi plate with fresh green chilis and green chili sauce. PERFECT. Even when we get to go it's still hot and crispy. My only compliant is they are stingy on there salsa. They make you pay extra for EVERYTHING. Some of there people are a little cranky too.....but the food is amazing!!!

Hmm the fact that you think it's ok or really didn't acknowledge that your staff asked us to stay another night in order to receive a bath is beyond my eyes!!! I do believe that dogs do suffer the amount of attention they get from your staff with the amount of dog and cat runs. It took my dogs a week to calm down and relax. I'm not looking for a place that has couches and tvs for my dogs, I mean really come on???? And when the guy brought out my dogs and I said oh are they coughing....maybe your employee should have said if anything becomes wrong with your dogs please bring them back and we'll look at them for free....just sayin if you wanted to offer that above and beyond customer service.

We heard about PW from yelp. We were a little confused that it was inside of merchantile square. However I am glad we did try it. Willy and his wife were very gracious, sweet, and accomodating! My husband got a dog (the BBQ one) I got the perogies (only on Wednesday) and my son got PB & J. The first you notice is everything is made with love. The food was amazing and reasonabley priced! We will definetely be returning!!!

I can't tell you enough how much I truly enjoyed this place!!! The place was packed when we arrived. The hostess sat us promptly and ensured us our waitress would be right over. The spunky little thing came over to us and took our drink order. With as busy as they were she still had enough time to explain some beers to me and give me some great recommendations. We noticed the table next to us had an array of chicken tenders and sauces. We got their recommendation and ordered us some chicken tenders which I might add are only .99 a tender. They were great tasting, moist, and crunchy. I like that you can add "heat" to the tenders them self or to any of the sauces they have available. Then the meeting of the regulars began. What an amazing group of people we met there. Everyone was so friendly and so down to earth. I have found my new waterhole. Wednesday nights they have boneless chicken wings for .59 and Thursday .99 tenders and Trivia on Saturday!!!! LOVE THIS PLACE =)

I have given this place 3 chances. First time I ordered Meatball Sub Platter to go. The salad was great, side pasta was good, main dish Meatball Sub was forgotten. Second chance ordered Stromboli Roll to go. Waited 30 mins roll came out and they burned it so I had to wait another 20 mins. got the food back to my work. It was complete dough they came back to replace the roll said it would be 15 mins turned out to be another 45 mins. Finally tried Meatball Sub again. Meatballs were not cooked and sub some cold. Gave up and left. I wish this place was up to par, maybe they can't handle the crowds. The flavor of the food is good but I gave them enough chances and not one good experience =(

Where do I begin....no one was in the places when we arrived. Not that it matters but sometimes it makes me wonder if no one is here is the food really that good? We ordered the food - chicken tortellini, Italian Hero, and kids cheese pizza. After telling the order taker 3 times what we wanted she still rang it up wrong. We proceeded to our table and waited about 5-10 mins for our food well some of it anyway. Pizza & tortellini arrive but not my sub. Everything is premade or frozen food. Nothing fresh! I waited about 10 mins more for my sub then had to remind them. Needless to say we left after a few bites of my "bread" sandwich. Probably won't be back here again!!! Oh ya all for $28!

I love this place. Possibly another new favorite place of mine! Jason and Lindsay were amazing servers. They have trivia on Wednesday nights and the place was full!!! I tried the beer sampler which was great and fun. Also tried the nachos they weren't really anything to write home about. Had a great time here!!!

I honestly don't know where to begin on this place. I guess my regular nail lady spoils me...however I was super excited to try a new place.  It begins with me being told to pick out my color. Which you are supposed to pick out the toe color first if you want matching. Idk why you have to do one without the other a match should be a match? So of course I find a color and they can't find a match after the owner went through for 5 minutes how he has the best selection of colors in Chandler and has a match for every polish.  Now it's pedicure time with Ashley. Sweet girl but awful pedi. My toes looked no different from me walking in to when she was done cleaning them up. So I had to literally pick out everything that was wrong for her to fix. Then she used the tools to clean her tub that she just used on my feet. After she used them she went back and put them on my feet.   The whole time I was there the owner was walking around asking people you'll come back here right? This is your new nail salon right? I felt like I was being hustled for a nail salon. Then there's another girl that just stands and stares at all the nail techs. Her job idk? Intimidation??? Make sure they're not giving any freebies away?   Back to the mani now. Everything that's a normal for me was an extra for them. Like roughing up my nails for the polish to adhere to them or 3 coats of polish. Ashley couldn't file my nails if her life depended on it which was so frustrating.   Needless to say my nails and toes look like crap. He offered if anything happens to them come back and they'll fix them for free. Well I shouldn't have to come back. They should be done right and last for 2-3 weeks.   Of course I will not be returning or referring people to this place!!!! UGH!

I decided to go here one morning with my son. He liked it bc there was a lot to choose from. For me offer hand ehhh.....first the owner was very grumpy that morning. I tried to order some type of coffee drink, since there are posters everywhere for different types of coffee drinks. Nope only thing he has is a coffee "smoothie" Uhhh no thanks! Then he asked me the most random invasive question...."are you Chinese?" I don't care about races but why ask that? The tables were filthy. Sitting there watching my son eat with nothing to drink he seemed to enjoy it. I took a bite; it was good and fresh. Undecided if I will be back.

I am so sad to write a bad review for this place. I was so excited to try this place. The staff was very nice and friendly and fast. However the food was a different experience. The chips are tasty, the salsa and "hot" salsa tasted like ketchup. It was pretty bad. I went with the Pollo Rico. The chicken was so awfully dry I used the ketchup I mean salsa to help it out. Even then it turned into tomato soup. I asked for more hot salsa the waitress told me they have habanero salsa. I asked for some of that....it was ok. The refried beans so so hot however so so bland. They absolutely had no taste. My son was not a fan of his food either....The place it's self is beautiful and they do have a great atmosphere. I will try one more time but after that $20.00 for mexican food between my son and I is not worth it.....sorry =(

Oh my goodness....why didn't I stop here 2 years ago?? This place is fun, yummy, and just awesome. My family and I went here on a Friday afternoon. It's small and quaint...just perfect. I wish I remembered everyone's names because they remembered all of ours! They took time to go over all the menu items and even how they started the family business. Everything's homemade every morning. We had green chile quiche, chilli, broccoli cheddar soup, meatloaf sandwich, ham and cheese sandwich, and lemon bar. We don't have one complaint. Only wish that we came here years ago! They were taking orders for Thanksgiving pies which was awesome!!! They do custom pie orders too!! We will be back for sure. Oh yeah one complaint they aren't open on the weekend boo! LOL love this place and love Jeanine (hope I spelled it right)

The first time I came here Maddy was at the front desk. I came here 20 mins before a class starting. She talked to me explaining to me it's a cross between high impact aerobics meets yoga meets Pilates meets ballet. Well with 20 mins to spare I bought an outfit (because I thought this was a juice bar) and I dove in with my two feet! Well....half way in class yes I did want to have a heart attack but I got through.   I have a medical condition and all the instructors here will help you and make it work for you! They motivate you and make sure you get through each class. After three classes I saw immediate results. Everyone here is so nice and welcoming. If they don't know you they will ask you your name and will remember it!   They have a great selection of workout clothes!!! Trust me lots of money has been spent here! They sell the most delicious smelling candles and adorable bracelets!   If you're looking for a new workout look no further! All the girls of PBC will welcome you here

I've been waiting and waiting for Sip to open! Finally the day has come. Where do I start about this wonderful, fantastic, deliciousness place!   Well I guess I can start with the wonderful staff of Sip. They are so nice and friendly. Honestly they will stand and go through item by item, ingredient by ingredient. And tell you the benefit of everything. Not like going into Whole Foods and just hearing uhhh it's good for you! They know the real true reason  why their stuff is so good for you. Everything in here is true pure 100% organic! No fake stuff here!   There is a variety of items to pick from. Juices, smoothies, make your own, açaí bowls, shots. They make everything right there so you won't be seeing naked juice or anything like that!!! It's a little pricey because you are paying for quality!!!!!! Remember that healthy costs if you want unhealthy there's Dunkin up the street. However you won't find nice people, awesome flavorful food there so try Sip and you'll love it!!!
