Ok  been here 3-4 times and finally taking the time to write a short review.  This is a great spot for wings, pizza, salad and subs!!  So far  my top in the Phoenix area  everything I have had.... I have loved.  Im sold it is not to close to my house but Iam convinced I need to drive to get great pizza, lots of flavor and it heats up fantastic the next day (the cheap pizza sometimes is good but doesnt taste like anything the next day!)   the winds are great  and if you like heat  they got it.   the italian sub is great toasted cant wait to go back again for lunch  $7.99 1/2 a sub and salad  great dressing salads are fantastic.  Im sure their pastas are just as good will be there soon to try them out......Customer Service is top notch   servers and very attentive to your needs and freely let you know if a special is a better deal for you.  great place you will love it!!

ok...not that good, not horrible.   First I had no cash and got charged $1.50 to use my Visa debit card so my 'lunch special' that was $6.99 ended up being $13 with a drink. Portions were small,  bean were a bit watery.  Had two carne asada tacos, not much flavor and the steak was cut in to big chunks, not normal for Carne Asada from my experience.  Tortillas seemed store bought and fell apart while eating.  There you have a honest review.  will add a pic.

Fantastic service and extremely helpful.  Kimberley took her time with me and never rushed a sale.  I feel I got much more than I paid for.  It seems they are more concerned with customer service than actually making a sale, which is very hard to come by these days......they have won me over as a lifelong customer.  Highly recommended!!!

GREAT ! Burgers  fresh fresh fresh   and I like the way to put your own topping on.  great flavor and 3 sizes to chose from and double it if you want.   Had the jalapeno poppers they were great as well.  we will be back, many times!

....Ive been here in the Phoenix area for only 8 years and although I havent been to 'every deli and sandwich shop in the entire valley,  Ive been to a lot!   After many 'drive-by's' I finally stopped in for a sub last friday.  I had the #1 basic Italian sub.....OMG  hands down,  the best I have had in Phoenix,  E A S Y ! great imported Italian meats everything super fresh....and R E A  L Italian!!  I went back today... the the #1 again! and tried the Meatball....BEST IN THE VALLEY! Great Meatballs again  the best Ive had in Phoenix.   this is a great Sub stop....and possible Pizza  They have Square Sicilian  I will be trying that soon and will let you know......This is a 'no-brainer'  best Subs in Town!!!

I have to give this a 4 star for the breakfast burrito   I just had the 'Amado' breakfast burrito and it one of the best I've had in AZ.  Made with hash browns nice and soft to mold the bacon egg and cheese into a gushy goodness! Fast. Hot and great taste if breakfast burritos are your passion as they are mine dont miss this hot spot! Looking forward to a revisit!

this is great pizza at a great value!!  great flavor wings are fantastic and the feta dressing is like no other!!  you wont be disappointed  Ive been going for sometime now and keep giving them 'another' chance......service is  still very good....pizza has gone down hill....prices have gone up- I understand that  bad economy everyone had to survive....but smaller pizza even though they deny it....it used to be bigger   less cheese  less everything  very disappointed  when something is soooo good  why does it have to go badddd?

very disappointed.  Ive eaten at a lot of Farmer boys in California and I know their burgers are  very good....but  I stopped for a breakfast burrito ok it was $6.09 but it should be big and good well it was small very small and very dry not enough cheese not enough hashbrowns alltogether DRY and SMALL for $6!!! what  a rip   I hope I get over it by my next trip out there so I can enjoy a farmer boys burger  DONT get the breakfast burrito  not worth $2    very disapointed.

about my 4th or 5th time here.....service is great....food has been great everytime.  had the lunch combo  taco, enchilada beans n rice $8.95  tastes great  wish it was cheaper for lunch but that is nothing more than sign of the times.  good salsa  mild and hot  chips are good, but could be warm.  they are in a 'tough' location  but well worth a visit,  have not been disappointed   will post pic.

food was good.  service was poor.  could not get a Ice Tea refill after we got our plates.  My wife got a 'pecan chicken salad'  no pecans.  when I brought it to our servers attention  she found out from the back they were out..... ok if you are out and cant provide what is on the menu,  shouldnt you offer a substitution ???  what if I was $3 short for my bill ??  so  food was 'good'  not bad not excellent but good,  but will not return based on service.

FYI   just wanted to let anyone know that may be listening,   I just noticed I had a email response from the Manager at Caballero Grill  sorry for the service we got and wanted some feedback from me.  Just saw it have not gotten back,  so it seems it could have been just a 'bad' night for us and the Management is on their game over there,  will update it anything changes.

been wanting to try this out for a while and finally got my chance....I went for the burger...was not impressed  I think the patty was a bit to lean for my taste  and did have 'different' flavor probably from the rib meat Im guessing but it came off a bit 'exotic' for my taste and what I look for in a burger....the bun however is a nice egg bun I think is a bit 'dense' for the size of patties they serve and although I prefer thin patties I like to see them with a less dense bun.  Sauce was good but not a fan of 'leaf' lettuce on a burger....shredded Iceberg to me is the best way to go.  did not try the frys but was intrigued by the tacos so I tried their  short rib taco, its was nice  different  salsa was good and fresh.....if I went again  it would only be for the tacos, 'if' I went  Im on the other side of the valley doubtful it would be worth a second trip.

ya  this is as good as it gets....... service is unbeatable!! went this last sunday for the first time,  ok I picked a omelet that I was not very fond of....with out batting a eye lid the whipped me up the John Wayne (denver omelet) and it was as good as denver omelets get...fantastic  hash browns were fantastic  my wife had the french toast  very unique  everything we had was great  but the thing that stood out the most was the service,  we will return again and again  its very difficult to find places these days with service like this,  the way it should be.....  sorry no pics  I was to busy eating!!

if you are from the Detroit area you will feel right at home at this little piece of heaven!!  Just had their Coney and a bottle of Vernors! Talk about their is 'no place like home!'  I have had some 'coneys' here in the west and they usually miss on the 'dog' not Detroit Coney Grill  they appear to have the natural skin casings  that give you that 'snap' when you bite into them, fresh onions, great coney sauce  everything that is great about Detroit you will find here!!  I plan to be back soon and try their burgers they look great as well.  And did I mention FAYGO?!?!  in the bottle  nothing like Faygo!!  great spot  hope they expand to the westside soon!!

OK  I have lived here in the valley for about 10 years,  been on a search to find 'real' made from scratch sausage gravy and have finally found it!  great sausage gravy actually sausage/bacon gravy is fantastic BEST IN THE VALLEY !  Great Service super friendly staff....JOE even came over introduced himself and was very appreciative we were eating at his Diner.  I had the corned beef hash cook perfect and 3 eggs, biscuit and gravy  great meal.  I/We will return many many times  this is my breakfast spot now!  I hear the pancake are fantastic cant wait to go back.

Just really good honest thin crust pizza exactly the way you want it.  The novelty of it makes it a fun place to take the kids.  Top notch ingredients. Service and staff was also top notch.  We will be back.

Well was very disappointed to see out favorite ice cream parlor closed but delightfully surprised at how much we like this spot!! Service was FANTASTIC TOP notch!!  Taco was great lots of cheese. Freshly deep fried shell not like SO MANY Phoenix mex restaurants use!  Enchilada was very good. My wife really enjoyed her chimichanga.  My moms chilli reanno was great too.  Everything we had so far was great.  We will return. Highly recommended.

Great pizza. TERRIBLE SERVICE.  I can handle the fact that these owners have little to no personality.  What I can't handle is BAD SERVICE.  I  get pizza there 2-3 times a month. Not a lot but  not never.  Walked in there tonight with a $5 coupon on got in my email. Coupon did not say you must print out so I preceded to show him the coupon on my phone. He stops me and says I have to have it printed out.  I sarcastically said 'oh I'll run home and get it' he said 'ok'.  I walked towards the door and said ' actually I will not be coming back'.  At that point he said 'I'll take the coupon'.  Well I say which is it?? You either take a coupon or you don't.  Maybe it would be a better idea to make the 'right' decision BEFORE you piss a customer off.  I'm DONE with pizza factory.

Been waiting for a really good burger spot to come to Goodyear for a long time now.   Very good burger.  Shredded lettuce which is a must.  Well seasoned burger.  May be homemade thousand island.  Very good. Fries crispy. Service good   Clean.   If you like 'Mom n Pop' burger places you will love this one!!!
