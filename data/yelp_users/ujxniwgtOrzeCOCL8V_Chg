I HATE chain restaurants.  No matter how much people tell me how great they are, I feel like I'm getting something ordinary.  This is soooo not true with Roy's.  Each restaurant carries the vibe of the city it's in.  The SF Roy's pulls you in from Mission street with the copper topped bar and two level open dining room.  It pulsates with the City vibe, but has just enough of the Hawaiian undercurrant to remind you where you are eating.  The Phoenix location has FLW influenced touches and feels both contemporary and familiar.  The same goes with the food.  I've had a half dozen dishes on the menu, and while I hate to say it, everything is good here.  I'm partial to short ribs and their's are the version I compare others against: fork tender with a rich sauce, not fatty or tough and resting on a bed of mashed potatoes that manage to be creamy without being dense.  Seafood is a specialty.  Their seared tuna comes with a wasabi and a mustard sauce and both complement this delicious dish.  For a great value, order off the seasonal Prix fix menu. On my last visit, we ordered one prix fix and two appitizers for my husband and I.  There's was more than enough food and we were able to try a wider variety of dishes.  Oh, and the shrimp risotto app came with two monster shrimps, perfectly cooked, of course.  We also got the seared scallops, divine in a lemongrass cream sauce.  Service is a standout here.  No matter what you ask for the staff are attentive without being overbearing.  I always feel like a welcome guest when dining here.  And just to be clear, we are not big spenders, but I feel like a high roller no matter what we order. Bottom line; Roy's is one of the best chains around.

Sushi.  You either love it or you, well, don't.  And don't think you love it if what you really like is deep fried cream cheese topped with Siracha.  That is not sushi.  Hiro is Sushi.  The location, in a strip mall on 90th street, is decidedly un-sexy.  We've been three three tims this year and I always see the same things: - Actual Japanese guys working the sushi bar - Actual Japanese people eating there - really fresh fish - Friendly staff  The restaurant has an ols school Japanese bistro feel.  The service is friendly and warm.  The sushi is spectacular.  We had salmos, Hamachi, Unagi, and tuna.  All were fresh, melt in your mouth tender and had the kind of flavor you want your sushi to have.  No tadpoles here.  No cloudy dilm.  Just pure, fresh from the ocean goodness.  They have some nice specialty rolls, and we tried a few.  Prices were reasonable.  Rolls average 8-10 bucks a pop.  Nigiri runs 4-7 bucks a pair.    Now, this is one Japanese place where I wat to try the actual food.  The tempura on the shrimp tempura roll is what other batters aspire to be.  Light, crunchy, not greasy.  Like the thought of batter.  I can only imagine what a plate of it would be like.  well, maybe I won't imagine.  Anyway, highly recommended.

When we pulled up to the Senor Taco in Fountain Hills, located in a run-down strip mall behind a Circle K, the 1st thing I noticed was the trucks.  The parking lot (what there is of it) was full of big trucks with construction looking tools and equipment on the backs.  I thought, "this is a good sign."  The restaurant has gone through an interior upgrade, so the formica booths and tile floors are clean, but not much more.  You walk to the cashier and place your order (or use the drive thru).  It comes up in about 5 minutes.  The prices cannot be beat.  We ordered the fish taco plate and got two huge tacos in fresh corn tortillas with cabbage and fresh crema.  The rice and beans are awesome but never quite hot enough (that's why they only get 4 *).   My husband and I can get ONE platter and split it all for $6.99.  The prices on everything are reasonable and the flavors are authentic.  The folks that eat here know their mexican food.  They have a self serve salsa bar with your usual salsas, and my favorite, pickled carrots and fresh radishes.  Yum.   It aint fancy, but it's cheap, quick and delish.

I love breakfast places.  After 10 years in the Bay Area (where breakfast places are an art), I thought my breakfast dining days were over.  Not so...Thank you Orange Table!!  A slice of neighborhood heaven in Scottsdale's Civic Center.  The coffee is good, the service was warm and welcoming, the menu is varied and yummy.  I loved the art on the wall and the vibe here is very neighborhood hang out and very little of the Starbucks cookie cutter.  Bonus that you can bring your dog!!

I've reviewed F&L's before - Food's good 4*, portions are a little smaller than you might expect.  I clean my plate every time.  How many Mexican restaurant's can you say that about?  I've had bad experiences here TWICE when using internet coupons or certificates.  The 1st time, I was told that the restaurant was no longer accepting that particular certificate.  I had just purchased those coupons about a month before.  Now, I PAID money for those certificates, but, it was a discounted amount, so I sucked it up and threw my two remaining certificates (and money) away.  Now, a week ago, I got a notice that a Deal Chicken I had purchased for F&L was expiring.  I buy a lot of online Coupons (Groupon type), and I don't remember what I bought where or if I used it or not.  I checked online, and the coupon site said my certificate was good.  So, we trotted down to Old Town for dinner and when I presented my certificate, they said it had already been used.  Apparently, they log their certificates on paper and DON'T update the websites issuing them.  We were the 3rd table that night trying to redeem a coupon that had been used before.  The manager came over and apologized, but it was really too late.  We had a bad experience for no reason, other than the owner's refusal to log coupons online as used.

It doesn't look like much from the outside.  Sandwiched between a great biker bar (if you're into that kind of thing) and an oriental rug mart, you may be wondering if you need to brush up on your bar fighting skills.  Oh contraire, mon freire.  Open the door to Razz's and you'll probably see a bar full of patrons, people eating and laughing, eclectic art on the amber hued walls, and Razz behind the open-kitchen bar.  With his thin, grey ponytail and snifter of scotch, Raz commands an audience.  ANd people line up to sit at the bar and watch him preare their food and entertain them with his charm and effortless command of his staff.  We've eaten at Razz's a dozen times.  The food is always good. Except for the Seafood Beggar's Purse.  I personally believe that you shouldn't eat anything with the words beggar, dirty or dick in it.  So, skip the Beggars purse.  Everything else on the menu is well executed, if somewhat pedestrian.  Foie gras topped fillet is an orgasm in your mouth to be sure.  Macademia crusted halibut, with the flaky moist center send chills down my spine.  Now is it innovative; unique?  Not so much.  Is it delicious?  YES.  For a restaurant in a strip mall, they have turned their space limitations into assets.  What could be a dark and dingy location has become a warm intimate space with the feeling of being invited to dine with a very wealthy friend.   There are several burgandy lined booths, with warm lighting and local art throughout the space.  The staff are gracious and attentive without being boorish.  You'll often see Razz's wife fluttering around the dining room (she has striking red hair) checking on diners.  They take care of their guests.

Thank you for being a respite from The Strip, my little Cafe. You were hard to find; I almost lost it looking for your elevator between two shops along the Grand Canal, but when we finally made it upstairs to your light filled atrium, I knew it was all worth it.  The free coffee refills didn't hurt either.  Your food was fresh, healthy and delicious.  Sprouted Wheat Bagel!  Yes, I think I will.  House made granola was a delight; and a good portion too!  Tofu breakfast sandwich was on the small side, but looked and tasted delishous.  And what a lovely fruit cup it came with!  $30 all in isn't terrible,  and with real food in our bellies, we lasted until Happy Hour.  Of course, it was 11am when we ate breakfast, but you know how it goes.  So, thank you, cafe, for being such a sweet surprise.  I will be seeing you again.

This is my store @ FLW and the 101.  The store's always CLEAN (including the bathrooms), has a Starbucks INSIDE (woo-hoo!), well stocked with lots of friendly and helpful staff.  BONUS: there's a TJ Maxx and Ross in the same shopping center.

What's not to love about a grilled cheese sandwich, animal style? It's like a salad on a bun and costs $1.95.  I'll take two.

I've been going to nationwide for three or four years. The staff seems young and earnest, but occasionally clueless. But, I won't be going back. I got an eye exam in January, paid the extra 40 bucks for the contact exam, got trials in February then got sick. Life threateningly ill. I wasn't able to go in for a follow up until now. Company policy says that after 30 days, I need a new contact lens exam. No exceptions. So, I'll be making my next appointment somewhere where they show some kindness and understanding. And I'll be contesting that charge on my credit card.

Favorite place for groceries. Good prices on staples. Sign up for the e-newsletter and you'll get a weekly coupon.  My love for Fresh and Easy is widely known.  I am a very capable cook; I'm just busy.  I love, love, love several things about F&E:      - Smaller store size makes it easy to navigate      - Good prices on staples; plus they carry a lot of store branded stuff      -  50% off stuff that's reached the sell by date.  Just put it in the freezer people. Negatives are - small selection generally, Fresh produce is laughable and a lot of space is taken up with ready to heat and eat items.  Now, I love the heat and eat stuff, but if that's not your gig, you'll find some things missing.  I get weekly coupons that reduce my grocery bill about 20%.  They carry a store branded wine for $2.99/bottle that is actually pretty good.  The staff are really friendly and helpful and I genuinely like shopping there.

We were planning on meeting my dad at Rosa's for dinner, but after pulling into their dark parking lot last night, I realized we would need other options.  We struck out on option 2 (why is no place in Mesa open on Sunday nights?!) before yelping our way to Blue Adobe Grille.  My expectations were low.  The restaurant looks like it took over an abandoned International House of Pancakes building (only smaller).  The interior is generic 70's diner, but clean and well lit.  There were a handful of people scattered at tables around the restaurant and we took a table near the bar where two LCD tv's were showing football.  When I took a look at the menu and saw we were in a New Mexican style restaurant, things started looking up.     On the wall are a couple of chalkboard panels showing the daily specials, each something off the regular menu offered that day for $10.  On Sundays, you could pick any of those items for $10.  That just about made the trip right there.  We each ordered off the "specials" menu.  Dad added a side salad to his stacked enchilada.  The salad came quickly, it filled an 8 inch place and had about 1/2c of goat cheese on top, with roasted red peppers and baby greens.  Our meals came about 10 minutes later: Blue Seafood enchiladas (shrimp, salmon and crab in blue corn tortillas with rice and whole pinto beans), Chorizo stuffed chicken with chipolte mashed potatoes and stacked chicken enchiladas.  The portions were amble, but with quality ingredients; boneless, skinless chicken breast, all white meat sliced chicken in the stacked enchiladas, roasted pepper sauces, fontina and goat cheeses.  Everything was delish.  And at $10 per entrée, the bargain of the century.  We are definitely going back!!

I've been looking for a stylist since I moved from CA EIGHT years ago!  Finally found one with Jon-Michael.  He gave me an awesome haircut, completely appropriate for my age and face, and it's something I can style myself and get near same results.  That's a 5 star stylist in my book.  The highlights he put in look natural.  People kept commenting "did you do something with your hair?  It looks great!"  I NEVER got that before.  The salon has a very personal touch, and I feel like the style I got was unique to me, without being totally over the top.  I feel fantastic, and my hair looks and feels great.  Completely worth the price.

THIS IS FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLY...  McCormick's is a sold chian seafood restaurant.  I've dined here for full dinner several times and the food is typically well prepared, if unimaginative.  Happy Hour runs Monday through Friday until 6:30pm with drink and food specials in the bar and front section of the restaurant.  We arrived at 6pm on a Fridayy night, and it was standing room only in the bar, but we were able to grab one of the "happy hour" tables in the main dining room.  There are about a dozen items on the HH food menu, including a $2.95 half pound cheeseburger.  Prices range from $1.95 to $4.95.  We ordered fish tacos ($1.95 for 2), ceviche ($1.95), cheeseburger sliders ($4.95 for 3), sweet potato fries ($3.95), Ahi tostadas ($4.95), and steamed mussles ($2.95).  The fish tacos were two dry corn tortillas with one piece of blackened fish in each.  There was cabbage and tomato on the plate which we put on top.  They weren't terrible.  The ceviche has a thick tomato base and tasted more like ketchup than anything.  Mussels were stringy and chewy.  They looked dried out despite being cooked in a white wine broth.  The sliders were GREAT.  Soft rolls, grilled onions, cooked medium.  The Ahi Tostadas were also great; three peices of seared Ahi on fried wonton wrappers topped with purple cabbage and a sesame dressing.  Sweet potato friens are sweet potato fries.  They were hot, crispy and plentiful.  There were no liquor specials listed on the happy hour menu, only beer and wine specials.  I had a $5 champagne cocktail and hubby ordered a $4.50 beer.  Next time, I think we'll stick with the things they seemed to do well, which are also the more expensive offerings.  The service was smooth and attentive.  The atmosphere is not high energy or exciting.  This is a place to eat and go, not to hang out and people watch or chat.

I ask my husband for one of these for my birthday every year.  The cake part comes in like 8 different flavors, but good old chocolate is my favorite.  The cake is moist and flavorful and dense, but somehow doesn't seem heavy or processed.  And it's not too sweet.  How do they manage that?  But the real kicker is the cream cheese frosting.  yes, my friends, this is what it's all about.  That thick, tangy, sweet, frosting all over that yummy, moist cake.  I think I may have to pick one up on the way home.

We've been to Jasper's three of four times and have found that the food is consistently fresh and well prepared.  The restaurant is always clean, and the service is friendly in the way you want a neighborhood place to be.  Casual, but not so informal that you feel like you have a new BFF.  The food is Cajun influenced, and mostly delisheous.  We've ordered the Crab and Avocado Salad (outstanding, even at $18.  Lots of lump crab meat and avocado.  Very fresh), Jumbalaya (I thought it was delish, but if you're looking for hard core authentic, this is not your place.  It's like jumbalaya for Americans).  The $5 cup was almost enough for a meal.  The Crab dip is not their best.  I've had better and you can get it anywhere, so why not focus on what Jasper's does well?  ANything with shrimp in it is a home run.  Their shrimp are plump, well seasoned and properly cooked.  Shrimp tacos...yum.  Meatloaf sandwich looked like a heart-stopper. Thick slices of meatloaf, fresh roll, and you can add a side soup or salad for $2.  If you live in the area, I would make Jasper's a regular part of your dining rotation.  It's not a destination place, per se, but it's worth checking out.

This bar changed over a couple weeks ago to Boss Hogg's and the change was a good one.  It's a college bar that serves beers by the bottle and roadie sized liquor bottles for you to shoot on your way across the street to the staduim.  The TV count has increased exponentially.  It's kind of a sausage-fest, so if you're a dude looking for some female company, this is not the bar for you.  But if you're just looking for a place to grab a quick, cheap beer before heading over to the game, it was a definate WIN.

We went to the Cosmo on a promo for a get away weekend.  Self parking is located off a tiny driveway off Las Vegas Blvd.  Blink and you'll miss it.  The check in desk is located in the WEST tower, and should be labeled as such in the garage.  It is a long walk.  Check in was smooth.  My attendant, Abby, was helpful and sweet.  We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite with a view.  She walked me to bell service and Daemion loaded up our stuff and took us to the room.  The hotel has a very upscale, modern feel.  Lots of chrome, and highly polished wood.  The Chandelier Bar is a great place to sit and watch the action unfold.  The crowd seemed to be mostly people int he 25-32 range.  And at night, everyone looked good.  The Casino weaves throughout the 1st floor, with the occasional bar in between.  I did not gamble, so I can review the casino, other than to say the people in there were young and good looking.  We were in the East Tower, which is closest to LV Blvd.  The room was well designed and beautifully appointed, if you like contemporary design.  It has a very modern look, and if you don't like that, you won't like this hotel.  I loved it.  There was a separate living room with a curved sofa, over-sized coffee table and chair.  The kitchenette was small, but had a microwave and dishwasher (to wash what?  There were no dishes), along with the Sub-Zero refrigerator/mini bar.  NOTE: that space at the bottom on the mini-bar is a FREEZER!  it's not a space for you to put your beer.  As we discovered the next morning.  The bedroom had an incredible view of the strip and overlooked the Bellagio fountain.  There was a dressing area that separated the bedroom and living space.  The bathroom was huge, with double sinks, a separate toilet room and a Shower/bath room with windows opening into the Master and the deck.  The tub was big enough for two, easy.  The hotel is located next door to Bellagio, across from Paris and Planet Hollywood.  It was easy to get to several hotels on the strip for dining, shopping etc.  I enjoyed our stay at the Cosmo and will definetly stay here again.

I love breakfast.  I love Lunch and DInner, too, but there is something I find wonderfully indulgent in breakfast out.  It reminds me of my single days living in the City and meeting girlfriends on Sunday monring to rehash the previous nights debauchery over toast and fried eggs.  Which is pretty much what I had planned on doing at Jacqueline's Cafe Sunday morning.  I met a girlfriend, our single days long behind us, for breakfast at 10:30am.  The restaurant has a lovely covered patio with a nice view of Camelback Mountain.  We got coffee and perused the menu.  The Down-home chicken caught my eye: friend chicken with waffles smothered on country gravy.  I asked the waitress if they made their own fried chicken and she said yes.  I got the gravy on the side.  My girlfriend ordered the corned beef hash skillet; a popular breakfast item according to our waitress.  For breakfast, 10-15 minutes is an acceptable wait time between ordering and serving.  If a place is packed, it can go out to 20.  Jacqueline's was about 50% full and our food took 30 minutes to arrive.  I wish I had taken a picture to show you what they served me, yelpers, because you probably won't believe it.  The plate the waitress put down had three chicken tenders across a Belgian waffle.  I should have sent it back.  No part of that dish resembled the chicken and waffles I've ordered and enjoyed on many previous occasions and frankly, a restaurant would be better served to take something off the menu than to put a half-assed plate like that in front of a customer.  I was concerned about my friend's dish, but the plate set in front of her had two golden fried eggs on top with hints of fried potato peaking out around the edges.  Her multi grain toast looked fresh and hot, so I thought she got the better of our order.  Once she ate her way through the eggs, I could see the canned corned beef lurking underneath.  It was mixed with some more substantial beef pieces and fresh potatoes, but there's no masking the taste and smell of canned corned beef hash.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing.  Maybe the chicken fryer was out that day.  Or they ran out of the house made corned beef.  I saw the manager in the background, checking on tables, watching the flow.  What they need to be looking at is the menu.  There may be several good dishes on it, but you should never risk turning off a customer by presenting them with a bad dish.      Because of the good location and comfortable vibe of the restaurant overall, it is my sincere hope that they get their menu turned around.  If they do, I'll be back to try again.

Came here thanks to a coupon special.  If I had known how big the portions were before I came, I wouldn't have bothered buying the coupon.  Hash House is located in the M Hotel.  Nice place, both of them.  Waited 5 minutes for a table on a Saturday night.  The service was the hang up.  Our waitress was nice, but she was the only one I saw in the place, servicing a dozen tables and bringing out plates the size of hubcaps.  Seriously.  We ordered Fried Green Tomatoes to start  4 slices, each about an inch thick, with goat cheese and balsamic syrup.  I wanted it to be good, but it was just ok.  Something was missing, like flavor, maybe?  The garnish was a thick slice of watermelon, and that was my favorite thing about the dish.  For entrées we ordered the crab cakes and the Pounded Pork tenderloin.  Again, if I'd known about the portion sizes, we would have split a salad and an entrée, but ce la vie.  My plate was 20 inches of thinly sliced, fried something covered in brownish-red gravy, sitting atop a mountain of fried mashed potatoes.  It looked completely unappetizing.  I'm not sure what the meat was, probably pork, but it WASN'T tenderloin.  I took one bite and couldn't eat any more.  Under the meat/gravy combo were some really nice mashed potatoes with roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions, but I had to peel back a scab of fried cheese to even get to them.  The whole meal was a turn-off.  The crab cakes, however, were thick and light, drizzled with a nice red-pepper roumelade and served with some yummy roasted squash and green beans.  It was a solid 3.5 star dish, especially for the size/price.  We finished with a completely unremarkable bread pudding for dessert.  The whole meal came to about $70, and could easily have been about half that if not for the stupid coupon.  Totally my bad.  I would like to try the place again and order more approprietly.  We saw several other people eating in the restaurant and their food looked good.  The comments I overheard seemed positive as well.  SO, I say, give it a shot.  The M Hotel is in BFE, but it could be worth the drive for the value.

Can't believe I've lived in the Valley almost 10 years before my 1st visit to Filiberto's.  I've tried several things on the menu, but this is the bottom line - the places are SPOTLESS.  The food is cheap and real and good.  I'm partial to a tostada when I'm in a hurry.  I'll get an enchilada plate if I'm in the mood to sit down.  Both fill me up.  The salsa bar is always a nice touch, although I don't think their salsa is the best.  Quality fast food and a good price.

Went with my husband Sunday (4/28) for Brunch using a LivingSocial certificate.  When we checked in with the hostess, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait.  I was concerned; there looked to be 9 or 10 parties waiting to be seated.  We waited over an hour before calling it quits.  I started waiting inside the restaurant where I heard two large parties come in saying they had reservations, only to have the hostess tell them they had no record of it.  I overheard another frustrated woman say she had called ahead twice and was told they didn't do reservations, but that the wait was minimal.  When I looked in the restaurant, there were empty tables, clean and unseated.  45 minutes in the hostess apologized for the wait, said the kitchen was backed up and that it would just be a few more minutes.  We waited another 30 and left.  I was extremely disappointed.  Our time was wasted, the kitchen was clearly unprepared for the day and the front of the house staff looked overwhelmed.  I would anticipate weekend brunch to be a big draw at this place, but the cafe was so understaffed it makes me question whether it's worth going at all.  Buyer beware.

I live right up the street, so after checking the reviews I decided to go to Tom's Thumb for breakfast on a Saturday morning last month.  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out.  It feels the most indulgent to me and I'm a coffee fanatic.  I'll take all you can drink java over soda every day of the week.  You go to the counter to order - I give the basic breakfast a try: two eggs anyway you want them, choice of sausage or bacon and home fries with choice of Toast.  so, over-medium, bacon, sourdough.  And a coffee.  Simple enough.  my total was $12, kinda pricy for eggs and bacon, but ok.  I got an order number to take to my table.  They have a dog friendly outdoor patio which my pup and I seated ourselves.  The restaurant is more self service than not.  To be expected in a gas station joint.  My plate came about 10 minutes later.  The eggs were over HARD, the bacon was greasy and soggy and the home fries are a packaged frozen product.  The overall plate was lukewarm at best.  I didn't think you could screw up bacon and eggs, but this is not the dish to order.  They had a number of Mexican breakfast specials on the menu, and maybe they are better.  I didn't want that much food.    Bottom line - eclectic interior, easy ordering, great patio, kinda pricy, bad basic breakfast.  Stick to the BBQ; sounds delish.

After my 1st visit, that manager contacted me to say that my experience wasn't up to their standards and would I like to come in and give them another shot, on the house?  Hell, yes I would!!  It means alot to even have a manager respond positively to a customer's poor experience and I told him so.  Nice service recovery (and I need to speak up faster when things aren't up to snuff.  My bad.)  Anyway, went in for breakfast on a Friday.  I ordered the Chorizo and eggs breakfast tacos and a vanilla latte.  The tacos came out pretty quickly; about the same wait time as other diners' around me, so it didn't seem like they put me on a stat order or anything.  The order has two soft tacos on flour tortillas, with a side of salsa.  They were full, but not stuffed.  The eggs were fluffy and hot, the chorizo was not greasy AT ALL (an accomplishment in itself) and the salsa tasted homemade with a nice balance of cilantro and tomato.  The tortillas were fresh and the portions was great.  I struggled to eat the second one; couldn't finish in fact.  This was the experience I wish my 1st one had been.  It was great.  I'll be back now!!

I know a thing or two about telecom.  I've negotiated contracts with about a dozen telecom companies over my career, and it's about as rewarding as a root canal.  I worked with David at Comsource on my past contract negotiation and he was able to provide me with accurate and timely information, excellent pricing, and good follow up and follow through.  He was always available when I needed him (even while on vacation) and as a result we have a lock on a good price for a reliable service.  I would highly recommend his services to anyone looking for a through and OBJECTIVE review of their telecommunications services.

I love this restaurant.  Been here twice and everything we had was delicious.  Portions are on the larger size.  Prices are reasonable.  Food is fresh and always well prepared.  The bread board is a NOT MISS.  I'm also a big fan of the smoked salmon app on the oversized tater tot.  Their tater of the day is fun, cheap, and worth a try.  When we ordered a side of bacon, they literally brought out a PLATE full of it.  For $3.  SCORE!!  Now taking reservations for parties of 5 or more!

Tucked into a small shopping center next to Paris-Paris off Scottsdale Road and Bell.  If you've ever had WaHoo's, you have a good idea what to except.  It's Hawaiian style fish tacos.  This means:      - Fish is grilled, not battered and fried      - Fish is mahi-mahi or ono      - fish comes in good size chunks      - No cheese or sour cream      - The portions are HUGE  The fish was fresh, the mango salsa topping was delish.  My husband and I each got the fist tacos, 2 to an order, and both commented that next time we'd get one order and try something else.  My biggest complaint are the prices (10.95/order for the tacos) and that the rest of the limited menu is made up of fried foods.  There aren't any sides to speak of (fries or onion rings), the apps are all fried (shrimp, calimari, etc).  Seemed out of place for a joint which serves everything fresh and homemade.  Overall a good tropical style fish taco.

This is a complicated little property.  I'll break down the review into some key areas and then you can decide for yourself.   - Location: 4 Stars.  The Saguaro is right off Indian School and Drinkwater; the heart of Old Town..  You are within easy walking distance (even if your drunk) of dozens of bars, restaurants, nightclubs, shopping, you name it.  The hotel has pleanty of parking and is on the Old Town trolly route so you can take advantage of all the old town entertainment without being taken advantage of.  - Service: 5 stars.  Every staff member I encountered made me feel like a treasured guest.  The check in process was smooth.  The hotel amenities and policies were explained.  They gave my dog a house made treat.  The valet staff were friendly and approachable.  They answered questions and made helpful suggestions.  When I asked to change rooms, the valet watched the dog and the front desk handled my request quickly and without argument. - Property Condition/Amenities: 3.5 stars.  This is a converted Holiday Inn, and while they've done a good job creating a fun and intimate atmosphere, this is not a typical resort property.  Everything feels just little bit closer together, just a little smaller in scale.  It isn't bad, it's just different. The lobby is open and clean, with cool modern Mexican decor.  The landscaping is mature with tall Palm Trees, colorful paint and furniture.  Jasmine serves as live screening between the 1st floor rooms, offering both some privacy and great fragrance.  There are two average/small pools, no hot tub.  One pool, Picante, hosts a weekend pool party from 10am to 7pm and the music is loud.  The Calma pool is smaller (small for a resort type property), and you can still hear the Picante party, but it generally has a relaxing vibe.  Lots of chaises; we never had a problem getting a spot.  The on site Spa is more of a series of treatment rooms.  There's no locker area, sauna or steam room.   - Room: 3.5 stars.  We had a 1st floor double room facing the Calma pool.  1st floor rooms and semi-private patios with outdoor furniture and are worth the upgrade price.  Even in the summer, it was awesome to be able to hang out at the pool, then walk back 10 steps to the room for a beer.  The rooms are on the smaller side, narrow and long.  Beds are comfortable, with quality linens and duvets.  Everything was spotless.
