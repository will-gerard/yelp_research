Ponchos is the go-to place for us when you're wanting good Mexican sit down and even take out. I love their house margaritas and the Boracho burrito will always be number one. We always sit in the bar because it feels more open and they have a projector screen where they play the most popular games even when  Vicente Fern√°ndez is playing on the jukebox. I love this place.   The only complaint that I have is that it's only open until 10pm which is toooooo early! Love you Ponchos!  **To those with the bad reviews...you just don't know what to order. :P**

I love Pho. It's the kind of food that warms your heart and tummy. I look past the terrible decor and get down to what counts: the soup. Happy and her cute little daughter always welcome me with a smile and know exactly what I want every time. Well-done beef and the spring rolls.   Great place for lunch and you can take out the soup: Just make sure you have a big bowl at home to put it together and don't forget to request the sriracha and hoisin to go!

My boyfriend and I pass by this place almost every day and it crossed my mind one day to come here to eat since it was on the way home. I felt like a burger and beer and actually searched yelp for a burger and beer and this place turned up.   Ambiance was ok, The place was pretty busy with yuppie guy couples on their lunch breaks. We sat at the bar and I immediately got a whiff of the tuna sandwich special. Eww nasty. We were helped right away by the bartender and were happy to see that the HH lasted from 11am to 7pm so we ordered a beer. Four Peaks IPA for me and Blue Moon for my man...ice cold and good. The beer exceeded my expectations...I love IPA. Ordered a burger, the blue cheese and bacon one, substituted turkey burger and got a side of veggies...my bf got the regular burger with cheese. It didn't take long but once the food came out that's when the disappointment sent in. The bun...the most important part of a burger aside from the actual meat was awful. It was dry and came apart immediately. Not just mine, but also his...tried to put mayo to tack it back together but it didn't help and the steamed veggies (my attempt to be slightly healthy) were cold and not completely cooked. I would think it would be hard to mess those up but they did and they were. All in all, the beer was good. Probably not going to go back, I can get a good IPA at Four Peaks instead.
