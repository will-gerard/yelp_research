The staff here is caring, helpful and always return phone calls when ever I have needed them too... Toby, Dr. Stewart's assistant is amazzzzing. Dr. Stewart has always been very thorough and not just in and out. Actually takes the time to go over any questions or concerns.  I love this place!

This team of experts are great! Took my sons car in and it needed a lot of work but had it back to us the very next morning. I wold have given them 5 stars but there was a paperwork malfunction... They worked it out with us but that's the only reason not 5 stars! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!

If you want unbelievable customer service at reasonable rates call this company for your garage door needs. I am an avid believer that customer service is just something so hard to find these days.... I am a customer service rep at an AC company here in AZ so when I get above and beyond service I will scream it from the roof tops! I called them when my spring broke on Tuesday night at 4 PM I could not get my car out of my garage to go to work. They were at my house at 5 PM! Fixed everything and my garage door works way better than it ever has. It's quiet when you open it now... All I can say is WOW about this company.

First time here, loved it, came back for the second visit not so great, tried them again last night, HUGE MISTAKE!!!! This was for take out - They got my order wrong, didn't even get my entire order and when I called to speak to a manager I was told there was not one there. When I started to voice my complaint the girl who answered the phone was very defensive, she said I took the order it was not wrong. When I asked where the rest of my order was she hung up on me. I called back and she refused to answer the phone, I blocked my # she picked up and needless to say we had words. However, I have never in my life been told by a business that I was a customer of F*#k you and hung up on. Stay away they would rather be right than stay in business! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AWARD EVER!!! The owner should be ashamed to employ people like this.
