Ok, so to all of those yelpers who give Chevy's a low rating because it's not "authentic"...? That's like giving Spam a bad review for not being "real meat".... Duh! We all know it's not authentic, but we're not going to Chevy's to eat authentic food, we're going there because it tastes good.  With that out of the way, I absolutely adore Chevy's. Their homemade tortillas are amazing, and everything I've ever had at Chevy's is delicious.   The only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is just because the service can sometimes be a little "off". Other than that, I LOVE it.

This review is a little bit late, but I still dream about the Scottsdale Resort as if we stayed there just yesterday.  Our room was absolutely GORGEOUS and huge. We had a view of the golf course, and one night we even went outside to watch a late-night fireworks show over the course.  Our bathroom was also giant, and beautiful.  Beds were comfortable, pool was wonderful, and the  pool-side bar was great too.  We have recommended this hotel to several of our friends who have enjoyed it as well.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is just simply because we didn't feel like the staff did anything "spectacular" for us, and frankly I don't even remember any of the staffers, which usually means (for me) that they were just average.

A for atmosphere. This place has great ambiance from the moat to the dark cave-like rooms.  However the food left a lot to be desired. We got the blue corn enchiladas and chile rellenos. Just meh. Nothing special. Plus I hate places that don't offer chips and salsa for free.  Won't be back.

I have to rave about this place....  Not only are the portions HUGE, but the food is absolutely delicious. The boyfriend and I split the Hawkeye omelette, which has chicken, avocado, bacon, and melty cheese all in  fluffy omelette pillow. Not only did this save us money, but we were still stuffed.   I can't wait to go back!

Wow!  Came in here on the reviews of other Yelpers, SO glad we did.   Got the California Surfin burrito (amazing), the chile relleno, the beef tamale, and the camarones en el Diablo.   So much food, and all so freaking good.
