Disappointed AGAIN! 3rd time in a row they have been 10 mins late and pizza has been warm. Not like the warm out of the oven but warm like sitting in a car. I used to order frequently but that will stop after these last visits.  Amazing that it takes an hour to deliver and I live 5 mins away.

Pretty awful. Ordered takeout and was not impressed. The hostess answering the phone was rude as well. Went to pick up the order, two out of the three girls were friendly. I'm assuming the bitchy one took the order. I ordered the grease bowl....I mean chicken enchiladas. It was so greasy it looked more like enchilada soup.  My wife ordered some tacos. She wasn't really impressed either. I've had manuel's before it never was this terrible before.  It's a shame this location sucks so bad seeing as though it is so close to me. Looks like Valle Luna from now on.

This place was awesome.  The owners were very helpful and were engaging with the ALL of their customers. It appears like they love their job and it shows. You rarely see this these days. The food was amazing as well. I can't wait to find an excuse to be on that side of town again so I can enjoy their tasty food!

Great customer service needed a last minute print for my wedding and the wonderful gal Autumn (I hope I spelled her name right!) came to the rescue. Thank you for making my special day a little easier.

Worst customer service ever. Ordered online took over an hour to arrive and still arrived wrong. They called to tell me that they were out of chicken nuggets a half hour into my order. Which was fine, then 25 mins after that I get another call asking what drinks were ordered. Finally the food arrives after an hour and 15 minute wait. It was cold and completely wrong. I called back to tell them of the mistake and The so called "manager" gets into an argument with me saying the order was correct and the best he could do was 20% off my NEXT order. No offer to fix or replace so I tell them to pick up the sandwich and just refund me and I get into another argument saying he can only refund minus the tip because he would be in the negative. Seriously, OVER A FUCKING CHEESESTEAK. 15 mins he calls back and says I voided the card for you. What a joke. I would never order from this place just off the fact that if something is wrong you have to pull teeth just to get your money back. A simple sorry and a refund or an offer to send the proper food out would have been nice. Instead they want to make everything difficult and argue with the customer.   Working in customer service myself I have learned that in no circumstance should you argue with anybody. It's just common sense.  I've refunded people for a lot more than a shitty 12.00 sandwich without blinking or arguing. I know if I didn't I would get fired. But then again I could always apply at Corleone's and tell every customer to fuck off and be just fine. There is definitely a reason to this location is getting 3 stars overall.

I used to love coming to this theatre. Now they changed their dinner menu to something you could find at a dive bar. Way overpriced for mediocre at best food. Absolutely terrible. Changed review to a 1 star after sitting thru an entire moving with what sounded like a vaccum going off every 2 mins during the whole 2hr movie. Asked the waiter the theatre is claiming "wind" what a joke. We were in theatre 7 right near the kitchen. Don't plan on heading back to this location.

Awful.   My wife and I waited way to long to get our pathetic burgers. I dont understand why this place insists on serving messy burgers on 2 inch paper plates.  After the long wait for our food the server Graham has the nerve to ask if I had cash instead of a card since their card machine is temperamental.  I think he smoked about a gram due to his slowness and lack of attention. The "bottomless fries are pointless if your server only comes by once to drop off your food. I'd rather eat a spoiled hamburger from the trash can of a dirty McDonald's than dine here again.

These guys were absolutely amazing. I called first thing in the morning to see when someone could come out and repair my ac unit. I was told that no one would be available until 12:00 so I proceeded to head to work. No more than 10 mins later I get a call from Michael saying he will be there in 15 mins. What service!! Mike was excellent. He came in, found the problem then went to go get the right parts. I was up and running in no time. Best part is, I was only charged $380 which was shocking since I expected to pay around $1,000. I had a blown motor and one other part that needed replacement. These guys are honest, hard working professionals. I will never have any other company work on my AC issues in the future although, I have a feeling I probably won't need any service any time soon. I even offered Mike a beer when he was done, like a true professional he declined. That guy deserves a raise! Thanks again Flores!  ** Also per fellow yelper Greg M I asked if I needed an annual inspection and Michael was honest with me and said no checkup was needed for another 2 years. Plus my replacement parts came with a warranty so I am good to go!

Don't go here unless you want a 35 miniute wait and a surprise bill 8 months down the road. I just received a 458.00 bill for blood work done in June of last year. It is now February. Not to mention they never fucking informed me that it wouldnt be covered by the insurance before proceeding with the test. This is very sneaky and misleading. If I had known the blood work wasn't covered I never would have gone thru with it. The worst part is I even followed up with them several months earlier confirming that everything was paid and current after a random 38.00 bill showed up two months after my June visit. I was "assured" I wouldn't owe anything else. Surprise surprise 450 bill from their lab months later. I'm so glad I paid almost 500.00 for a 10 minute visit and a 35 minute wait thanks arrowheadhealth.

I am very pleased with this business. The work was top notch. It did take awhile to get the job done but Jazmine was excellent at keeping me informed on the status. She even noticed a scratch that was done by accident. They were very prompt to fix it without any argument. Now my car looks brand new. You guys were great thank you!

OUTSTANDING!! Left a message on yelp within hours I received a phone call. A few days later Rod showed up and gave me an estimate on my spool. He is thorough and gave me a very fair price on a filter and installation. I like that Island Life doesn't try to nickel and dime you. Rod was always on time and very quick as well as efficient. You have a customer for as long as I have this spool. Also thank you for bringing my trash can up to the house! (now that's service)  If you are in their service area don't use anyone else. If you aren't in the service area I encourage you to move! Thanks again, I will be in touch.

I miss teakwoods. The service here was ok, the waitresses were nice and the manager made his rounds. Thats where the positives stop. The food was not very good. I had the burger and so did my girlfriend. They said its angus meat although I doubt it for 8.00. The meat was dry and fatty. I have had better burgers at wendys. I was really bummed this place wasn't better since its soo close to me. I will just have to go to zipps or the vig for a real burger.

This place was busy but we were seated within 20 mins. The food was amazing and came out very fast. Our waitress was great, I believe her name was Emily. I will definitely be back!

I was pleasantly surprised. My wife recommended this place. I rolled my eyes wondering what the hell I was going to eat because it was healthy! First thing I noticed was how clean everything was. All of the employees were excellent at cleaning up there stations after cutting vegetables, prepping meats and rinsing lettuce. The best part about this place was the food. Everything was fresh and delicious. I definitely would go back anytime.
