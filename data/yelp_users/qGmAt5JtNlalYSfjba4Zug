TERRIBLE!  I lived in this complex under this management company for 2 years.  The roof leaked every time it rained, and that was never repaired.  My air conditioner leaked and only after they "cleaned the lines" 5 times- and the ceiling was soaked so I thought it would fall through- did they finally replace the decades old unit.  When I needed to move out, staff failed to file my notice properly then misinformed my by $200 what the final rent would be.  After moving I still owed $300. No one at the office was competent to explain the invoice.  When I tried to ask the manager for clarifications, he threatened to call the police.

I'm a fan.  I've traveled to Thailand and the staff is generally helpful in making recipes less authentic.  I keep forgetting NOT to order vegetarian pad thai.  Broccoli doesn't belong in that dish!  Other things are great.  My favorites are larb, fish cakes, and pumpkin curry.  My mother most loved duck red curry.  Everything is accurate level of spiciness.  Dine in or take out, it's a safe bet.

Great place! Something on the menu for everyone. I appreciate the diverse crowd- hikers, churchgoers, families, readers, single folks, old, young, gay, straight, and all colors of the rainbow. Vegan and gluten free options, dog friendly patio!

I love Scramble.  It's the place I go when I need to do a fast business breakfast/lunch, want to sit with a novel and linger, or need to be fed fast because I just hiked North Mountain.  The food is great, there's something on the menu for everyone.  Love it.  Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is sometimes I lose patience with new staff.  I've been a regular for a couple of years, so I know the menu better than they do.  Shame on me for impatience!

HUGE pancakes!  Amazing bloody mary's (my favorite is the Bangkok)!  You can eat healthy or indulge.  It's always packed, so come planning to be leisurely.  Service is efficient.

I love the menu variety, locally sourced food, and amazing drink list.  Terrific physical layout, cool people.  And even though I'm not a hipster, I feel welcomed and included.  Yay!
