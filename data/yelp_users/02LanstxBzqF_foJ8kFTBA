Ok I am going to start off by creating the scene for you all. Denny's is never on the list for a breakfast spot, but since we were on a job that was miles away from anything but a Dennys, we decided...What the hell. First off its always annoying being seated at a table between two huge families full of bratty, carpet munching, screaming children when the rest of the entire restaurant is empty..Browsing the menu in which even in the pictures of the food, the food still looks shitty... in rolls a man in a wheelchair with his leg literally sawed off at the knee. It wasnt bandaged or covered, just there for everyone to enjoy over breakfast. Our waitress hobbles over and we are assuming she is pulling a double after working the night shift. I order the 2 egg breakfast and my hubs orders the western omelet. When the food comes it seems not only the plate, my coffee cup and the food are all the same color. There is no color, no flavor, and no life to this food. Basically whatever ihop throws away, dennys recooks  and serves it to customers. So we are sitting there basically separating our food with forks, and even only after taking a few bites I wish to God I could force myself to throw up. Slowly my energy is being sucked out of me as my body tries to digest this salted load of crap...when the raging gas begins. I will tell you the only fun reason to go to Denny's, is they have the perfect "Pleather" to really let your farts rip roar and soar.

Fitness Cafe.  You walk in, its clean and tidy. You can see what is going on behind the counter, which I love.The owner is awesome, extremely friendly.  The only annoyance is that if your in sweats and glasses and not feeling like running into anyone "Scottsdale" this is not the place. Pretty much looks like the LA Fitness in Tempe or the 24 hour fitness next door. Which is understandable. If anyone has been to either of those locations- its one of those gyms where the girls where butt sucking spandex and prance around from treadmill to treadmill with an Ipod in one ear and a cell phone in the other...  Not all of us are on the HCG/HGH train-so between the photos on the wall of the hottest bodies around and running into the Affliction wearing meat-heads I try to avoid most days.......it doesnt make me wanna shove my face full of any sort of food, healthy or not.  Gotta say-LOVE LOVE LOVE THE MENU.....SO MUCH TO OFFER. So many healthy choices, in fact if there was a fitness cafe express/drive thru... I would eat there daily, breakfast lunch and dinner.  The menu has smoothies, breakfast wraps with egg whites- my favorite is the "All shook up" which is a combo of chicken, rice, broccoli etc...If you order a chicken sandwich thats exactly what it is. A very nicely cooked piece of chicken...not like anywhere else where you know they just stuck a costco special piece of chicken in a deep fryer.  On a scale of 1-10 for the food I would give it a 9.7, deducting a smidge for flavor- but who cares if it is healthy right?????  Location and no drive thru ---- 6.....

Any place that has the words Cornhole Corner written on the patio wall has my vote!    This place is awesome. I love BBQ so that helps. Nice little patio, awesome brisket!!! Good Menu!!   Laid back... Great for a starting place to drink and maybe walk across to Monestary.

YUM YUM YUM. 5 STARS!!!!  The best filet minion in town! My hubby and I always get the split plate and have mash potatoes and corn to save room for desert.  They have awesome wine. I love the bar. Sit in the bar for sure.  The other side is a bit Ihop-ish...I know, I know thats harsh...but true...The bar is where its at.  The crumbly bleu cheese salad is amazing. The hummus rocks!!! The Dirty Martini's have blue cheese olives! YUM... Staff is very friendly, bartenders are generous, prices are good. The new updated patio is beautiful.... Great for watching sports, they even have couches around the bigscreen!!!!  This place could for sure use a new stereo system as the one they have cracks and pops...but that is the only thing I can find fault with.  AWESOME! EAT HERE!

I have to say this place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant!! The location could not be better and the food is perfect!!!! For sure visit the patio, even in the summer. There are misters and large trees, great for groups, birthdays and business.

Chang's Spicy Chicken makes me go...Ding du du du ding ding ...nu nu nuh! Fan-freaking-tastic. I love PF Changs...which we have renamed PF-Twang-Bangers...or PF Chizzle in Scotts-Dizzle.   I know how mature right.... Best way to go about it...  Big huge pot of tea- I like the OOLONG Dragon Eye Calamari with the salt and pepper dip... An order of the Spicy Chicken...bow wow chicka chicka... Brown Rice of course! And an order of MooShoo pork ask him to put half in a box to take home for late night munchie factor... Followed by 2 fortune cookies...always spin them, whatever way the points are pointing thats yours!!  Oh yeah and remember after reading your fortune.. you must say "IN BED" loudly after reading it.....makes it better.  Rock on Twangs.

Jackrabbit "Stupid" Club...Ok for starters, the doormen are jerks. To  girls, boys, men, women, nice people, mean people, meat heads, sluts, small bunnies and other cute little fuzzy creatures.... JERKS.  Total snobbish meat heads demanding a cover to go in a bar where the music sounds like a low budget wedding reception. Even though Arizona is just a dry, hot and dusty place with no natural resources, people that hang in places like "Jackrabbit" are often snobbish and think they are extremely prestigious because they show up in outfits they shopped for all day trying to look like a coked up kid rock.... Inevitably they always end up with there panties around their ankles throwing up in a bathroom the size of a lunch pail with a mean poor person selling gum and smokes while trying to charge you to wipe your hands...  The bartenders always charge a different amount and could care less about making friends. When the hoochies come out to do their little show they basically push everyone and their drinks off the bar and sound off the fog horns. Out comes a few anorexic girls that dance around on the bar, clearly thinking they poop roses and fart sunshine....If you like songs like Charles in charge and YMCA in the middle of a house music set than this is the place to be.  Make sure you cash your paycheck because they are for sure charging you a cover...male OR female.  The only cool thing about this place is the wallpaper.

Went into this place the other day!! OMG what a frickin joke. They had some weird circus sex thing goin on...some boney freaky drugged out dancers in circus gear.  BARF. There was about two people in there. The DJS ALWAYS suck, this clearly should be flattened out into an empty warehouse, loose the bling or whatever you were "trying" to do, get a badass techno DJ like Donald Glaude or Tiesto, put in a booming sound system, cheap drinks and amazing lighting and START OVER. The door guys were dicks to people for so long it finally caught up with them. DONT CHARGE A COVER, YOUR CLUB LOST IT ALONG TIME AGO, TIME TO RE-BUILD. Take notes from Cream.

This is by far the worst theater I have ever went to in my life. We went on a Thursday and there were a bunch of pimple faced teenagers hanging around cussing, riding bikes, talking loudly as they seem to always do...anyway, I didnt want to upset my husband because he really wanted to see this movie.....We paid for tickets, still at a ridiculous price...walked in to a dirty entry way with some gothic idiot slurring and pointing to where the theater was located....the popcorn looked liked it was about to roll out its sleeping bag for the third night in a row....the slurpee machine spat out all over the outside of the cup and they didnt even clean it up or put it in another cup....By the way what is up with employers letting these kids have this wacked out surfer hair while at work. I feel like I am talking to a pomeranian with cystic acne....there are no beaches in Arizona, so why do you look like you spent the day surfing and playing an acoustic guitar outside Taco Tuesday for change....  The theaters are small and crowded and everyone seems to save seats, they will sell the front two rows so be prepared.  We got our money back before it started...this place is not cool.  Lock it up. You are still Harkins, which is a well-known name....

I visited Fuchsia for the first time on my birthday. My wonderful husband was good enough to send me to the spa for the entire day. Walking in I noticed it was upscale, classy and very clean. The staff was very nice and made us feel great the minute we walked in. They offered us citrus flavored water and I filled out the medical questions in the stylish lobby. The services are still a bit high in cost unless you sign up for the membership, but 100% worth it. I think the only thing I would change if it were my business if cheaper services so I could enjoy it more often on a Realtors budget. But if you like salon services such as customized facials, this is for sure the place to go! Fuchsia is located in Dana Park in Gilbert, and if you are looking for a new salon- this should be your first choice.

The Monastery is fun, creative and most of all laid back. All bars should take notes.  Volleyball and tons of space to spread out, listen to music, cook your own BBQ (food provided raw), games etc. Cool place for a wedding reception or party! Has kind of a tropical feel even for Mesa!!! Lots of little area's to get lost in and do your own thing.  NO drama at this place which is a huge plus.  Bartenders could be a tad bit more friendly as they seem to not really care as much as they could.  Overall a wonderful place to visit especially if you are tired of sportin' your man blouse and $500 shoes in the Scottsdale bars.....

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! This place has got it going on when it comes to healthy juices and food. We visited for the first time last Sunday and went again on Monday and brought our dog. We got him the doggie yogurt which he loved and we had the six on the beach and raw body shake. We took a veggie sandwich to go for lunch. If you are RAW or into juices this is the place to go!

The staff is the kind of staff that wouldnt be hired at a 24 hour Dennys. The place is a dive, it needs a remodel. The happy hour prices are what brought us in. (Margarita's) but once you are in you are shoved to a cash register where you have to keep going up to buy your drinks. The staff gives dirty looks and its the kind of place you think, I wonder what goes on in the back. We didnt dare eat appetizers like we normally do and we watched closely as they made our drinks.  Bummer, its close to home and we were excited about it. Its too bad.....

You wouldnt think much from the outside but when walking in you will find a very modern and very clean place. Booth type tables that overlook a very trendy bar.   Nice little touches like cucumber water and a great menu! The kobe beef burger is by far the best.  Very moist. I didnt care much for the ostrich burger it was kind of dry, but I am pretty sure that is how ostrich is.  Its for sure a hip hang out. Nice bar.  Great for mingling.  Overall Stax is a very cool place.

Eggplant wins! Eggplant wins! Eating here is awesome. The man that owns this is so nice. He always gives the girls at the table a little stuffed animal. He says for the kid in  you. Im SERIOUS!  The food is fresh, crisp, flavorful. Makes you want to eat healthy all the time! Great for a quick lunch, it takes just the right amount of time to come out. Not too soon where you wonder if it has sat under a heat lamp all day.   The water is good, not like some places here where you can taste the pipes.    LOVE THIS PLACE. WISH THEY WOULD OPEN ONE IN GOOD OLD COUNTRY TOWN MESA/APACHE JUNCTION...HINT HINT!  Keep up the good work. I wish they would replace all Mcdonalds with you!

Plan to wait in line for nothing....An utter hovel of a joint frequented by "Daddy's money" GAY-SU students and skanks in overpriced dresses from the "Chinese Store"...These hoochies have been known to be seen on the Discovery channel special about evolution. The bar actually lets them get up there, smearing they shoes on the bar to spin this wheel so they can get even more intoxicated...You may see one girl that looks somewhat classy, but guaranteed in less than 15 minutes time, she will be the epitome of a bona fide slut, due to her ghastly appearance and freakishly grotesque display of makeup and chonch hair as she dances carelessly upon the bar. The floors are a sticky mess, there are stairs in all the wrong places, the DJ is alright but the lighting is crap.....the bartenders are jerks, overpriced drinks...but if you are looking to run a train on someone this is the ideal spot.....

When the club first opened it smelled like leather and the door man was really nice. The music was really good. I dont think we really have any solid house/techno clubs out here with really good DJs. I for one am tired of "Resident DJ's" so anywhere that offers something that keeps people in good spirits is good with me.  The reason for the 2 stars:  Second time visiting, not so good.  Had 6 girls and 2 guys. As we walked up AFTER paying for valet, here is where the "crap" began.  The door guy says ID's ...OK off to a rolling start....ID's everyone then proceeds to tell us that there is a cover.  I am like "Dude, we are 6 girls we are not paying a cover" so he says, sorry ladies its $20.00 per person. So I being the only one to stand my ground said, "look, we are going to come in, we are all going to buy a drink thats $60.00 right there you are going to lose if we walk away." So he tells me, sorry he cannot do anything its $20.00 because Brittney Spears is in the club.  So I then told him, "Oh awesome, then you will be paying all of us $20.00 to go in!" Brittney  Spears, what a crock I laughed..... And we walked away...bye bye minimum $60 for your "little" club could have made off of us.    A wise man once said...."Think about it" We will not return.  PS We all weigh under 130 lbs...so this wasnt a normal you have to look like a celery eating boob stick and you girls do not so you have to pay a cover night in Scottsdale......

The bar is amazing but the staff is horrible. I have sent over 13 complaints to try to get a response from the owner or bar manager and have been ignored. We had our reception at this bar and it was a nightmare. Unorganized, rude staff, the waitresses could care less about anything accept for flirting with bartenders...Its so bad that the first time we visited, I had a drink and a sundae (which was amazing), but gave the girl a $100 bill and she came with change for a $20. I had to fight with her until she magically found the $100 bill!!! I should have known this was a good indication but because we used to love Toby, we tried our reception there. From start to finish it was a mess and we have wrote letters, called, emailed, hand delivered notices and NOBODY has called us back. Finally I called and tried to book a party for 100 people and got a call from Jenn in the booking department. I told her it was the only way I could get a call back...STILL IGNORED!! I could go on and on about how rude the staff is and how bad the owners have treated us after we had an unexpected, incorrect bill of $400.00 that night when we told the waitress in advance not once but 3 different times to cap us off at $250.00....Not once were we thanked for bringing so many people in that night, or paying the wrong bar tab, but totally and completely ignored. Twice the service/staff have messed up and nothing has been done. Its too bad because this place is exactly what Arizona was lacking. Too bad they dont care about return business.

Awesome remodel from Six to Revolver. The floorplan makes so much more sense now!! The music is much better now with the DJ booth sitting high above the club... Still not enough bar space as always, and good luck trying to get a decent drink, its obvious the vodka is watered down...cant mistake the tasty pang of good old Arizona water pipes...The bartenders are NOT nice...The owners go above and beyond like every other club to hire good looking sluts...problem is they are normally trashed and could care less about making a good rapport with the clientele....same with the door guys...you never know what you will find..they either are laid back and chill or they act like a reject off Reno 911 or dog the bounty hunter...HUGE improvement from SIX tho..hopefully they will get some more big name DJs and stop scamming on the drinks.  You are guaranteed to find a "black light honey" in this place....

Oh my gosh, we are so happy this place opened!!!! We eat here about 3x a week, normally we get a to-go order  of the crying tiger, two orders of the sweet sticky rice, and order of the #13 soup medium hot and two large THAI Ice Tea's....YUMMM!!!! The dining room experience is nice and the people are very friendly. If you are in East Mesa- for sure visit swan thai!
