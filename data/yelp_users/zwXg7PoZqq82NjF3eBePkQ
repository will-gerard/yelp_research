Absolutely the worst customer service! My experience was terrible. I called in an order for Delivery. I had two separate orders because I was ordering for another co-worker as well. We wanted to split the cost of the crab puffs, which the owner said would not be a problem. They would also split the delivery charge to .50 on each bill.   The food arrives and I notice both of us are over charged about $2.00 each. I mentioned to the driver and she did the math and said we were correct and that she will head back and adjust the charge and call back.   She calls and then the owner gets on the phone. He is screaming that the cost of the crab puffs are $3.95 per person. Please help me understand how on earth you can charge $6.95 for an order of crab puffs and when you split them in half that equals $3.95 a person?!?! Lets do the math here...  $6.95 divided by 2 = $3.48 (rounded up)!!!  Typically I would not care this much over such a small amount of money, but these people are all about every cent, so I do NOT appreciate being over charged because you are not educated to do simple math.   My bill should have been $14.87 including delivery fee plus tax and I was charged $17.61  My co-workers was over charged the same amount.   The owner was rude, raised his voice and had no idea how to handle a situation with an unhappy customer. He needs to learn to calm down and listen to the customer because in the end he has now lost the business of everyone here at this company who was disgusted with the treatment we received.  I will be sure to report this to the BBB and any other department necessary!

I love Bahama Bucks!  The service was excellent. All staff were in great moods and our experience was perfect.  The best part about this place is that their ice is so finely shaved that there are no ice chunks. All smooth and the flavors are so good. So many options.

We had a party of 4 on Valentine's Day for Dinner. The hostess was nice and the view was very pretty, but other than that, our experience was not good at all. The menu was a set menu and so our table decided to order something a little different so we could try the selections. Unfortunately we were not happy. I have had better braised beef short ribs at chain restaurant's and the flavors did not go well together. Each person at our table expressed their disappointment in the service we received as well as the food we were served. The presentation was even a bit sloppy. One gentleman in my party was so disappointed with the Veal that he asked to return it to the kitchen because it was not good at all.   We felt the service was poor. Our server lacked personality and was slow and didn't show much interest because the menu was set and he knew he was going to receive a gratuity based on $105 per person. The drinks we ordered would be finished and we would have to wait and flag someone down to ask him to order another drink.   Finally it was dessert time, and we each ordered one of each. I ordered the Strawberry Shortcake which was awful. I couldn't even swallow it the flavor was so bad. My boyfriend ordered the Champagne Sabayon and the champagne flavor was so overwhelming it was like taking a shot of alcohol for dessert. Our other guest ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut Torte which I took one bite of and it was so rich. Nothing was easy to eat and good on the pallet.   We felt this review was very important to write because the next day, my boyfriend and I went to Sedona for the rest of the weekend and had a wonderful dinner outside with amazing views of the mountains and stars with the moon rising. The food as excellent and service was great. The price was more than half less and our experience was so much better. We are all so disappointed and expected so much more from Elements.

I love this place. I am actually a member and receive monthly services. I have had an excellent facials from Milana and the massages were great too. Recently Rachel did my microblading she did an excellent job. It was a correction from a different technician in Mesa. I love everyone here!

My FAVORITE place to go for sushi and drinks! The food is so good here and the rolls are unique and well put together flavor wise. The fish is ALWAYS fresh which I am extremely particular with. I have been a pretty big sushi eater for years and finally we have something in Arizona which happens to be close to home where everything is fresh and always great!   Another perk is they have Happy Hour on Saturday even! The service is excellent and all of the staff are friendly and welcoming! The overall vibe of this place very cool. A great place for a date, dinner with friends and even family's! Absolutely worth every penny!

The staff here is amazing and Dr. Peifer is extremely hands on and personal with your file. I can tell he is passionate about his work and his patients happiness is very important to him. The girls that work here are so friendly and genuine. I would highly recommend this office and Dentist. Good ones are very hard to come by!

I wrote a 5 Star review 2 years ago and the rating still stands. We have been coming to Breeze Dental for a couple years now. My husband and I LOVE the entire staff! They genuinely care about you and they are all very passionate. We just recently took our daughter in and she is only 20 months. They made it so fun for her. She loved it. I love the teeth whitening after each cleaning too!! Seriously the best dentist out here!! HIGHLY Recommend.

We have always had the best service at this location!! One person in particular has helped us out on a couple occasions and has always gone above and beyond. His name is Triston. Talk about awesome customer service! This kid should own the place some day! The food is always good and if they do not have something, they have always suggested other items or sauces etc that would compliment the food. I have never felt rushed and Triston has left a lasting impressing on us that we wanted to be sure we point out what an excellent job he does!

Awesome little place for breakfast! Food is really good and the people are really nice. Seating is limited because it is a small place but I have never not had anywhere to sit. Staff is usually really nice as well.

YUMMMM!! Every time I come here, the staff are great and the food is always consistent and great! I am so happy we have a place like this closer to my home in Gilbert. I love wine bars, and this one by far exceeds my expectations.

This place is great! The service is exceptional and the owners are the best! I had searched hard for a nail salon where my gel manicure would not come off after a week. They take their time and make sure I am always 100% satisfied. Everyone is so personal with you and they really go the extra mile.   The prices are the best around!! I have referred a couple of friends and they have nothing but great things to say as well. Now they are returning customers! I am so happy I have found this spot!

We were very excited when this place opened! We really have never had a terrible experience. Our last experience was the first time the we just did not enjoy our food. Our server Lindsey was very nice and she noticed that we were not really eating and offered to grab us something else. We declined but the manager James came over and insisted they get us something else to make up for it not being to our taste. Then who I believe was the cook came out and just said, if you guys want some dessert, let us know and it will be on us! They were really fantastic with trying to make sure we were happy. We did not end up having dessert because we were full but the gesture was very nice. One of the bartenders who was getting off of his shift even came over and said hi to us because he recognized us from coming in a few times before. When it comes to the food, the Pretzel with Beer Cheese is the best! Make sure it is soft though! The beer selection is great and the knowledge is pretty good when it comes to the servers. If they don't know, they always suggest you try it which is awesome because you can try until you find something you really like! Great job guys!

I purchased my bridal accessories here and I am in love with the quality of product as well as the customer service I received. I have found most bridal stores run down, over priced for not great quality etc, but here at Grace Style and Bridal, I found nothing but the best! Plus the store smells smazing! The girls are so sweet and extremely personable. Thank you ladies!
