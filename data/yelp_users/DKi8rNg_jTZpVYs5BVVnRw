I am on a gluten free vegan diet, and the servers here are always very accommodating.  They will bring me a plate of sliced cucumbers and tomatoes in place of pitas with my hummus plate.  The food is always very fresh & tasty and service is usually very pleasant and efficient.  I do wish they would offer more gluten free options.

I have a lot of health issues and a very limited diet.  Trying to stay alkaline, and keeping raw, I have found many delectable options.  My first visit, I tried the raw chile rellano, then the raw coconut curry spring rolls which were PHENOMENAL!  I also got to try a raw vanilla cupcake with coconut strawberry frosting. This is currently my favorite raw food venue.

I went here looking for a small, lightweight bike. I told the employee I purchased a beach cruiser a couple of years ago and really regretted it; I'm barely over 5' and about 100lbs. My current bike was huge, very heavy, and impractical for riding the light rail. He actually argued with me, defending the beach cruiser! I asked him to show me something lighter and he showed me virtually the same bike I already had (with different handle bars), and claimed it would be the lightest. Needless to say, I did not buy a bike from them. This particular employee wasn't helpful or knowledgeable. I hope that's not the case for everyone who works there, but I don't think I would want to go back.

Just ate at Tsom tonight for the first time. I ordered the veggie wrap, gluten free.  It was delicious!  I overheard the guy at the front counter explaining to another customer that they only use fresh organic produce from local farms that is picked daily. This is good news to me as I try to avoid pesticides as much as possible.  The only thing I think they could do to improve is add raw vegan options to their menu.  Oh, and maybe start serving ionized alkaline water.  That would take them over the top!!

I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMO's and pesticides. So, I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :)

I came here for my birthday to pamper myself and got a gel French manicure and I think I got the deluxe pedicure (whatever included the hot stone massage, sugar scrub and paraffin wax). This is the BEST pedicure I have ever received! This place is very clean and professional, they even give you a bag with your nail file, buffer, etc. so you know they are only used once. You take it home with you! Everyone was extremely friendly and personable. I definitely will be back and highly recommend them!

Privately/family owned & operated, single sourced coffee. The same family owns coffee crops in Brazil and that's what they serve here! Best coffee in town!
