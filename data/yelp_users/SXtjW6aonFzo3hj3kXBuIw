Garlic herb butter and bread is always a great way to start a meal. I had the made-in-house pappardelle with scallops and mushrooms, and my wife had the special rigatoni di bosco.  The pappardelle is the real deal, and the cream sauce matched the noodle perfectly. The scallops were a bit tough, but what can you expect being so far from the coast.  The rigatoni was good, but not great. Given it was mostly vegetables with italian sausage, it needed a bit more spice than was on the dish.  The only sour note was that the Pepsi fountain tasted off. Sort of when you get mixed flavors from a bar wand.  Overall, everything was high on the list as far as authenticity. Price-wise, I thought it was about $5 a dish higher than the value received, perhaps due to the small owner-operated business. But it won't keep us from coming back.

Great prices for happy hour. Service is always stellar. Definitely ask to sit outside. Try the firecracker shrimp!

After all the hype from friends and coworkers surrounding Trader Vic's I just had to try it. Walking in, it instantly exuded that old-school Polynesian feel. I thought I was in for a treat.   The drink menu was extensive, as other reviewers point out, and the drinks that everyone at the table chose were excellent. However, the rest of the dining experience left much to be desired.  I ordered the Crispy Duck, which was pointed out by the waitress, and the special location on the menu, that it was a signature item. Sorry, but I have had duck more tender and with more flavor at a street corner Asian supermarket in Los Angeles.  After dinner, I handed the ticket to the valet, only to have him bring back a car that was the same color as mine, but not my car. They had to ask me to identify my set of keys. Very unprofessional.  Good thing we were with great company that evening, because although the environment was cool, and fostered great conversation, the amount of satisfaction in my stomach did not nearly make up for the dent to the pocketbook.

Tried Fuego on a local Groupon today. When the menus came out printed on aluminum, I knew we were in for a treat. Any place that has the guts to print a menu on metal knows what's good!  The highlight of our meal was the chef's special tostadas. Small fried tortillas with a guacamole spread, the perfect balance of veggies and cheese, and topped with a chipotle aioli.  We had the scallops de jalapeno, and the ropa vieja. Both excellent meals.  As they call it, a Latin-Southwest fusion, Fuego executes this perfectly.

I had only been going to Chick Fil A over the past few years for a chicken sandwich, lunch or dinner. I'm hooked on the chicken minis on the breakfast menu. Just the right balance between the bread and the chicken. Drenching it in honey makes it more awesome.  This place is what customer service is all about. I always try to thank every employee when they provide prompt, courteous service. Love the "Cathy-ism" when they respond "my pleasure."

CLOSED  But probably for good reason, the place was not well kept. I distinctly remember the carpet stains throughout. The burgers were pretty good.   I recommend the closest alternate location at Tempe Marketplace, but service was not stellar on my last visit.

What a great find in the downtown core. Went here for a pre-Suns game meal with a coworker. I love restaurants that pay homage to the former businesses that occupied the same space. The ambiance is remarkable, and the well dressed wait staff know how to take care of patrons with throwback style and respect.  I had the Carne pizza, and it was perfect. So many places end up burning thin crust, but this was great. Just the right amount of bubbly toasted crust, just enough texture to offset the savory meats.  What a great way to dine before enjoying some lower bowl Suns seats. See you soon Hanny's!

I really hope Bluburger can weather through the rough economic times in South Chandler. I have been coming here since the staff was at the Kierland location in Scottsdale.   We took some family here, and for whatever reason, they were disappointed. I think it was because they are Midwesterners, and like their burgers plain and simple. Whatever. Their loss.  I on the other hand, can appreciate quality bison meat on a gourmet onion bun. My favorite here is the southwest bison burger, with sweet potatoes and some extra chipotle mayo on the side. Flavorful does not begin to describe this burger. I can wolf it down quick!   A gourmet burger starts off with appearance. I could see eating this burger in the same place I eat $50 steaks. When you take that first bite, the onion bun starts off as something familiar, yet lets you know something else interesting is on the way. The gourmet burger finishes off when the bun gets the hell out of the way, and ushers in the juicy bison, and the incredible southwest toppings.   Who wants to meet for dinner!?

Whoah. The most authentic Chicago dog in Phoenix. Other places (Luke's, Chicago Hamburger, Al's), can learn a thing or two. First off, the place is spotless. It's nice to eat at a place where the restaurateur understands that keeping his place clean is an important aspect of the customer experience. Nice not to have dusty nasty t-shirts hanging from the walls. The fries here are also better comparable to other valley Chi-dog eateries. They perfectly match. This will now be a required stop along the way for any trip to/from northern AZ.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the beef sandwich. Sorry guys, but my gold standard for thin sliced Italian beef is Portillos (Joey's beef was almost twice as thick, the bread didn't have that toasted flaky feel, and the gravy just didn't do it for me).

Terrible service was just the start of my Groupon brunch experience. We arrived late on a Sunday morning, well after the crowd came through. When I sit down at any restaurant, I expect the wait staff to acknowledge me within a reasonable time. It took the waitress five minutes to even stop at the table, all the while checking in on the surrounding tables. Also, any time I visit a restaurant for the first time, I tell this to the staff, and ask for their recommendations on the menu. The waitress ignored these cues, and only asked what we wanted to eat.  After the long wait for drinks to come, one of my dining friends realized that her glass was cracked. I'm not talking chipped at the rim, but a crack all the way down the glass. When we finally get the waitress to alert her of the situation, all she says is "oh," picks up the glass, and walks away. Not even an apology for filling up a cracked glass in the first place.  I ordered the kalua pork and hash for my meal. Let me be upfront, that my standards for kalua pork are imu style. I understand though, that in metropolitan Phoenix, this isn't possible. The kalua pork here was just not good. If L&L can do a decent kalua with liquid smoke, I'd rather go there. The kalua looked more like a condensed pork stew, and was rather bland.   The location is good, as well as the d√©cor and ambiance, however that's about it. Not sure I'll return.

Business owner has indicated the customer service issues will be addressed with the affected employees. I appreciate the restaurateur's followup.

Solid 4 stars for The Living Room. Places like this are hard to find in South Chandler. Very welcome change from the monotony of chain establishments in the area. Don't come here expecting authentic Bruschetta. The bread is much thicker cut, and does not have the flavor of a toasted french bread. If you can put that aside, the toppings are excellent. I had the proscuitto and brie pressed sandwich, an interesting synthesis of French and Italian staples.   Overall the ambiance of The Living Room is what adds to the charm. Even on an early summer evening, sitting out on the patio is a great way to relax and catch up with your co-diners.

The butter burger, definitely the standout here. It has the buttery taste of a diner burger, a la Pie & Burger, but slightly more processed.  Tried the fried cheese curd and they left a lot to be desired. Nothing compared to having fresh fried cheese curd in Wisconsin. They are over battered and taste like cheese product was injected into batter shells (yuck).  On a positive note the house root beer is good.

I brought my Weimaraner here for veterinary visits, day boarding, and overnight boarding for the past 1.5 years until I relocated out of the area. Otto is a bit of a legend here, some may say high maintenance, but what Weim isn't?  I trust everyone at Ocotillo with my fur-son. Everyone is incredibly professional, welcoming, and will make sure your pet is cared for to the highest degree. The facility is exceptionally clean, and having used all services they offer, I definitely recommend Ocotillo as your one-stop shop for all things for your pet.

Went for a ride two weeks ago on a Rhino off Table Mesa Rd. off I-17. Although the trailer was a bit late (due to construction traffic), we still had a great time. The UTV was in great condition, we got an excellent walkthrough by Paul on the trails, and what to look out for. All of the scheduling and prep phone calls with Joe were great. Always a good thing when you can talk directly with the owner! I will definitely be back to rent again. Thanks for the great experience!

Pass. This is Thai food for people that either a) haven't had true Thai, or b) a few taste buds short of a full palate.   The tom yum was barely passable, and a cup costs as much as a serving for 3-4 at authentic Thai establishments.   But it's an Urban Asian Eatery you say? Doubtful. Chandler is hardly urban. Might as well add Bistro to the name. Save your dollars and go to Swaddee or Thai Rama.
