I have eaten in restaurant only a handful of times.  The service is friendly but lacking.  Now, I only eat here if it is catered at work and even then if I haven't brought my lunch into the office.  The vegetables are always overcooked, mushy and taste oily.  The chicken is always over done.  The beef is gristly and flavorless.  The sauces on the food, and the ones on the side, are gloppy and thick, often oily and often flavorless.  The egg rolls are small and greasy, maybe they need to drain them more before serving?   The good parts:  I don't pay for the lunch when it is catered at work, but like I said...I still only eat this if I didn't bring my own lunch for some reason and the fortune cookies!

I LOVE the food, the service is always good, the chunky and the green salsas are amazing and the tortilla soup is divine!  I could eat here every day if I could afford it...both financially and at my waistline!

With a large menu, everyone in your party is bound to find something wonderful to eat!  Every item I have had on the menu has been delicious and a complete delight!  The flavors are expansive and the desserts...YUM!  The Cr√®me Brule is divine!  The atmosphere is inviting and adventurous.  The bar has a very large selection of spirits and beers.  The staff has always been friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and professional.  The management is regularly seen on the floor and every time I have been in, he/she has come by to check on me and my satisfaction with my meal and service.    I go to the Elephant Bar and Grill at least twice a month and am trying to get a weekly girl's night out set up there!  The happy hour is perfect!  Oh and the fact they are involved with local events and fundraising endeavors by local non-profits gets an A+ in my book!

LOVE the interior!  The hanging hair dryers...a total first for me!  The sparkle floor!  The graffiti wall!    My girl Jen does a fantastic job on my hair every time I see her!  I will follow her wherever she goes!  She is the only person I have ever seen who doesn't instantly want to lop off my long hair.  Magic!  That is what she works on it, so that it isn't just a boring Jan Brady look!  She is a whiz with color, whether you are looking for extreme, natural or anything in between.  The fact she will bend over backwards to get me in if I need an emergency appointment is just another reason that she is the best!

Food order - almost always wrong. Availability of menu items - poor.   Price - always on the rise Customer Service - AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAA  When I stand there for 20 minutes before the jerk at the grill says he can't make my chicken sandwich because he doesn't have any chicken and I ask to talk to someone about it and that mystery person can't be found...ahahahahahaa No discount, no discussion, not even an "I'm sorry!"  Or should we bring up the large amount of employees who don't understand English?  They never respond to posts on their facebook page, there are no contact email addresses...just...radio silence.  Save your $, save your temper, save your gas, save your lunch time...Go to any of the other food joints in the area!

I am VERY disappointed in this location. I grew up on the original Chompie's, next to the bowling alley on Shea, and I hate to say that out of all 3 trips to the Frye location I have endured, all have had very poor service and my food has come out wrong each time.  Order eggs over medium, get scrambled...order bacon extra crispy, get limp barely cooked bacon...order garlic bagel, get onion...hashbrowns cooked lightly, get them almost burnt...order bagel lightly toasted, get burnt bagel....seriously, a server has to have some serious chutzpah to serve a burnt bagel!  Each time I went it was 1030-1100 on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Each time I waited almost 10 minutes after being seated for my server to show up.  Thank goodness for the busser/water guy!  No manager to be found.  When asked to take my food back and correct it, it wasa big deal.    Lovey and the family would be very disappointed to know this was how a customer was being treated in their family's well established restaurant.

I gladly pay the extra money to enjoy fantastic food, great atmosphere and most importantly the lack of unsupervised, uncontrolled, misbehaving children!  Just an FYI, the fries come with your burger and other sides come with the meal, so kudos to them for listening to the previous gripes and addressing them.   I have been twice. I will be back again. It is a nice date spot, great dim atmosphere with some music, but you are able to carry on a conversation with ease.  And, like I noted before: lack of children.  The few I have seen were all well behaved and parentally managed.  The service was great both times, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without hovering.  Give it a try and you may discover a new jewel of an eatery!

Love at first bite!  The dumplings are the best I have had...succulent, juicy and packed with delicious flavor!  I had not had scallion pancakes before tonight...they are savory and make you long for more!
