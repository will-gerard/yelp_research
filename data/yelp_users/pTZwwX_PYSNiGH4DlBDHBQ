I love this restaurant!!! Mexican food that is authentic and delicious.  I ordered the street tacos and they are so good I get them every time I go! Maria is usually there to cook the meals (when I have been there, at least) and she is sweet, shy but so accomodating!

By far the most professional and integrity filled property management company in Phoenix. Been renting for almost 2 years now. They're prompt, fair and they care. Highly impressed!!

I am grateful to these awesome guys at AAMCO!! They are honest and have saved me literally thousands of dollars. I had a flat tire near my work and took it to a Sun Devil Auto in Sun Lakes, AZ and they told me not only did I have a flat tire, I needed over $4,000.00 in repairs. I almost started crying. I had no idea my car was such a lemon! I took my car to AAMCO after getting a Living Social deal and they told me the only thing they found wrong with my car is that I had a leak in my power steering hose. It cost me $115 and that was it!! They said my car was fine and there was nothing else wrong with it.  That was over 30,000 miles ago and the car is still going strong! Don't go any place else!!

My husband and I went one Saturday for lunch and were SOOOO disappointed in the service that the would have to be superb for us to ever considering going back, but unfortunately it wasn't.   The salmon I got was pretty decent and the chicken mole enchiladas my hubby ordered were pretty decent, too. But the young server (he looked no older than 14) never should be on the front line of customer service. He seemed to never have heard of lemon with iced tea before, as the 3 times I asked for it I received a blank stare and finally on the 3rd time got my lemon.When he delivered our meals, he quickly disappeared without napkins or silverware. So we flagged down another waiter asking for napkins and silverware, his response, "I'll go get your server." So by the time he reappeared our food was cold.  The place seemed disorganized and like they had no system in place. even though I could literally walk there from my house, I don't think I will be returning.

First of all, I wanted to say we really wanted to like this place!! My husband and I rarely get out, so we were so excited to try JC's! We loved the location and the fact it was dark and live music was playing. So we were happy about the ambiance and the tone that was setting our night out, but sadly it was pretty disappointing from there!  First we ordered the trout and lobster dip as an appetizer and it was well... absolutely awful. It was extremely dry and the smokey taste was so overwhelming that it tasted like cigarettes and cat food combined. So we ordered the sautéed mushrooms thinking that we may have better luck. They came in a bowl with some onions and it was cold and tasteless. The garlic toast that came out with it, wasn't too bad. But we weren't sure what to do with it. Dip it in the bowl of mushrooms? Put the mushrooms and onions on top?   For our entrée we got the porterhouse steak and lamp chops, both with mashed cauliflower and veggies. The porterhouse was ordered medium-rare, but was cooked medium-well done. It was relatively tender considering, but was just bland. The lamp chops were actually pretty good (yay!) but the sides were so bland and disappointing. We love mashed cauliflower and make it all the time at home, but JC's was very tasteless. We could've made the mashed cauliflower and veggies better at home.   I cannot tell you how badly we wanted to like JC's Steakhouse. We rarely get a night out without the kids so it just stinks that it was a disappointing night. :(

We went yesterday for lunch for my mom's birthday. They were in from out of town and requested pizza. I called ahead and made reservations. The girl on the phone was really nice and accommodating. I got a text confirmation and even 5 mins before we arrived we got a text saying our table was ready. We were immediately greeted by our waiter Denzel who went ABOVE and BEYOND for us!! He put forth so much time and effort into our party of 8. Not to mention the food that was amazing!! Magherita pizza, Divola mango salad and something else I could remember but was awesome. Denzel made our day!! Thank you so much!!!!
