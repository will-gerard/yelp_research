The lunch menu is perfect. They are fast for a sit down restaurant and very helpful. I love the pad thai. My daughter loves that they make octopus hot dogs. I have never eaten here besides for lunch but I think it would be a good place to stop as well.

This zoo is amazing. I love that they have two splash zones. Please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in. The barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out!

Just okay-I went for a retirement party and was disappointed with what we paid for what we got. I like the location on Thomas way better and the servers were way more helpful too!

The place itself is a bit old school but the people working inside were super helpful and amazing to talk too. I am not normally a person who likes to chat it up with the people working but they sure made me feel comfortable. I went on a Tuesday night and I was there for three hours getting a haircut, shampoo, style, and a pedicure. I am sure I could have stayed there longer but I had to cut it off. The teachers were very in sync with their students and helping tons. Some of the students were distracted with other things because there were not busy but still got their work done. I will for sure go back!

I love attending this place when they have Living Social Deals. Their suites are just right for my family because the rooms can be separated for the kiddos and the parents. I have only ever gone in the summer and normally the water park is packed but the staff does a great job of keeping everyone comfortable and happy while playing in the water. This time we went we also enjoyed the smaller pools around the facilty and found them just as nice but without the people. Prices are a bit high on food and drinks but beyond that I am sold on a nice staycation to this place!

Attended for the first time at the peach festival and was blown away! Everything was super full of people but the lines moved fast which was awesome. Not a lot of directions unfortunately but when we started to ask questions people were very nice and helpful. We enjoyed the tractor ride out to pick the peaches and our daughter enjoyed picking the peaches which was fun. We came back and hung out in the shade and had italian ices to cool off. We bought a lot of peaches way more than I thought we would and we went home with a pie which was heavenly! Totally want to go back next year! Thank you for all of your hard work!

I would give this place a 5 but our waitress was totally annoyed by us and the fact that we could not order fast enough. I have never had that happen. I liked going in and seeing the MN Vikings head on the wall. The kids menu was great, my daughter totally enjoyed it. I had a bloody mary that was made the right way with a shot of beer on the side. My husband enjoyed the beer choices. The food was a bit greasy but still tasted really good. We will be back but hopefully we have a different waitress!

I was excited to try this place out after driving by it several times and seeing the fire places outside. I was disappointed to say the least. We were seated outside at a dirty table. When asked to have a clean table the bus boy rolled his eyes at us. We ordered drinks and there was lipstick on the wineglasses which was gross. We ordered our food and it came out but it was completely the wrong order. When we got our order the sauce was watered down completely-it was like a soup and not fresh, it tasted like it was poured out of a can. When our check came we were charged the wrong amounts for what we ordered as well. Not sure anything right happened. I know I won't be back. I am glad that my boyfriend had a good heart about it all and we were in no hurry. I am also glad it was next to Yogurtini because that totally saved the day!

I love other Macayo locations! I LOVE them, so I am so disappointed to be giving a review like this to one so close to my home. We attended to support my daughter's school with a family dining night. We asked to sit outside and that was the worst idea ever. Apparently sitting outside means no server. We kept having to go to the bar to get service which is very awkward with a small child. The food was cold when it arrived. This is so not the service you get at other Macayos, check out the other locations before going to this one.

The new addition really makes this place a whole day event. We barely made it to the safari area before they started to close! I love this place and how they care for the animals. The new aquarium area is becoming amazing with all the new additional items added. Love the otters!

We normally regular the Parkwest Harkins so that is what I am comparing it too. It is not as clean or orderly as the Parkwest location. The bathrooms were dirty and there were lots of junk on the floor. Still just okay though!

This is our third time eating here but the first since the remodel and it was great. They seem to still be working on some of the decor but it was very clean which I appreciate. The food is always organized nicely and clean. My daughter loves to be able to pick her own items. The soup bar is a lot larger then before. The noodles are probably the only area that my family did not like but that was okay because there was so many other yummy things!

The hamburger was amazing! I was a bit concerned about the condiments not being refrigerated on a wagon car but the food still blew me away. I ordered a classic. My daughter had a hot dog and it came on a hamburger bun which was interesting. My husband had the bacon one and it looked amazing. I will totally be back.

When we checked in on Sunday we were greeted and told about the ammenties. One was breakfast which was served until 10 am. The next morning my partner and I went to breakfast at 9 am filled up our plates and begin to enjoy the food and watching the news. At 9:30 a rude employ walked in and shut off the tv. When I asked if I could keep watching it she stated no they were closing even though we and several other people were still eating. My partner asked if we could just shut off the tv when we were finished and she said no it was time to leave. We were told 10 am is when it was finished so very confused. My partner when and turned the tv on and another employee came over and said they were sorry for what had happened. We told them we would be happy to turn it off when we were finished. When we got done with breakfast we cleaned up and left as we were leaving the employee that told us to leave the breakfast area was there in the hallway and asked to talk to us. I asked her for her name and she began to yell at us and told us to listen to her because she had worked there for 5 years and we were being rude. I asked at that time for her name again and she would not give it. Then I asked for the managers name and she would not give it. I walked over to the front desk to get assistance only to find out that she was the general manager, Pat Tanna. She continued to yell at us and tell us how her breakfast worked and how rude we were and that we needed to follow the rules. I tried to explain at check in we were informed that breakfast went to 10 and that this could have been handled another way. She finally gave us a business card when I told her I would be reporting this to corporate. Another employee at the front desk said she was sorry for the manager and said that this is the reason why she only worked there 2 days a week! Pat was so rude! We went back to our rooms to pack up but our keys no longer worked. After two times of getting them rekeyed we were finally back in and started to clean up. Which was a good thing because the cleaning ladies had already begun making so much noise we would not have been able to enjoy our rooms any longer! The hotel itself was fine and clean. The bar attached was wonderful and great service. The thing that HAS TO CHANGE is the general manager. I am blown away that they would take to a customer like that and keep yelling and not provide their contact information or name in any means. That was ridiculous!

We have gone every year since we moved to AZ and it keeps getting better. Make sure you bring cash and know to come early. If you have little ones take wagons with. Make sure you try all the food and catch all the shows. It is dirty and lots of walking but it is an amazing experience.

Woah! Go to the bathroom ahead of time! I was shocked at how dirty this place was. There was a huge hole in the ground and fences up to protect people but really for the price I paid for the ticket it should be a better venue.

I am shocked that this place is still in business! The waitress was new, give her a break but wow it kept getting worse. It took forever to get drinks and food, when we got our food it was not the right stuff and they forgot some. I had a hair in my hashbrowns as well. Another waitress came to help, which was their own saving grace. I will never eat here again! Yikes!

We stopped by the day before Cinco de Mayo to get our fix and we were pleasantly surprised at what this place had to offer. The pitcher of margaritas hit the spot. My daughter loved her kids meal. The only reason I can't give it five stars is that we had to wait forever for the check.

Went to check it out with the hubby and was totally amazed that this place was hiding in golf cart land. The place was very clean. Lots of people enjoying the baseball game on the tvs. People playing pool and darts as well. Beer was cheap for a pitcher. The food looked good but we did not eat. Just enjoyed the people watching and the beer! Totally will be back!

The service was okay with the waiter but the paying for the bill was horrible, we waited for 10 minutes at the stand and no one came. They do not have a kids menu which was sad but they did cater more towards the elderly with discounts as well. I would not go back because it was nothing special but the retro decorations made it an interesting stop!

I just attended for the Yelp event and I hope I can come back and check more of it out! I liked the lazy river and the slide. I hope they can do more work to spruce it up a bit because parts look run down with weeds at times but it is a cool place to hang out. As a parent I would like to see more lifeguards as well but as an adult it was okay and I would go back!

Chimichanga was amazing, spicy and perfect! The skinny margarita was mostly ice which was a bummer. Kids quesadilla meal is pretty plain and it is not fresh fruit, which was a downfall. I would totally go again to try a different drink and hopefully catch happy hour!

I was excited to hear that there was a place like this after Farelli's closed. The seating was a bit confusing at first to know what to pick from never being there before. But once we got in and seated we fell in love with the huge cushion recliners. The drinks were fine but a bit pricey. I ordered a type of nacho and it was really good but greasy and hard to find the jalpenos in the dark. My husband had the parm fries and they were awesome! I wsih there was one of these on the west side because I would totally be frequenting it more!

I have been to several Peter Piper locations and this was the worst! We waited in line to order which was not a problem but when we got up to our turn the cash register assistant did not talk to us nor acknowledge us in any way. We waited at least 10 minutes before she talked to us even when we tried. It was really rude. We sat down to wait for our food and were served dessert pizza first and then the pizza came. Not good when you have a child and you eat dessert first. We went to the bathroom to clean up before playing games and the bathroom was trashed no towels dirty toliet paper on the floor, disgusting. Then we went to play games and at least 5 were broken.  I will not go back to this location. I will stay close to the Peoria one, way nicer!

I am always amazed at the service that is provided at this shop! We have been using the services from Robert for the last 8 years and never regretted it! He always is honest about the services needed and does not nickel and dime you. He has saved my family numerous times with break downs and once his wife even picked up my husband and infant daughter when the car broke down on the freeway. Amazing help and service. I would recommend to anyone!

Out of all the locations in the valley for D and B this my family's favorite spot! Sign up for their coupons online and they will always hook you up. We have only ever eaten at this location and it is okay but you know you really go for the games. So check it out on 1/2 price game night which is Wednesday!

Mondays are the best days to check this place out. I like it way better than Peter Piper Pizza because it is cleaner and it seems like everything tastes a bit better. The pizza is not award winning but it is decent enough. The people working are all high school students it seems like but they do their job. They also have a secure way to get the kids in and out of the place which is nice!

I really like this location but the last couple of times that I have gone in with my family for the lunch buffet I have been so disappointed. The workers who have been checking people out have been so rude. I tried to pay for lunch with a large dollar bill and they lady was annoyed. My family ordered beer and she was put off by the fact that they asked questions about the sizes of cups versus pitchers. The food was okay but by the time we got home we were all sick and running towards the bathrooms! I hope this place gets better!

I was excited to check out this place since it is a local winery. I love the setup of the tasting floor. We came early evening and the place was packed with people. We were able to get a spot at the bar and started with 5 tastings. I love hearing about how the wines are made or what we should be tasting but the 3 different waiters/bar backs we had told us nothing, they were too busy. I did enjoy the wine-peachy keen is delicious if you are into white wines. We also got an appetizer but were a bit confused to see it all prepared out of a ziploc bag-sorta killed it for us. I would like to check it out again when they are less busy and we have more time to hear about the wines themselves.

I recieved a coupon in the mail for a free entree since we just moved into the neighborhood. When we went for supper I was surprised at how quiet the place was for the meal time. They had a wide range for kids meals which was wonderful! My daughter totally appreciated it. I ordered the El Pollo Especial and my daughter had a cheese crisp and both of us devoured our food. Super yummy and well cooked. The prices were a little high for what food we got but I would go back.

I have gone to this location probably 5 times now and this last time was by far the best service I have had ever! I ordered the Pollo Fundido and it was the bomb! I was stuffed for sure. The free chips and salsa were delicious! To top it off I ordered a sangria margarita and I was blown away but how delicious it was. To end the amazing meal we had fried ice cream that was a trip to heaven! I wish it was not so far away from my house so I could come back again. My only concern was that the food came out so fast that we did not get to eat a ton of chips and salsa or have another round of drinks!

I will be here a lot this summer for their summer movie deal with my daughter which is great! Best deal is to buy a t-shirt for the medium popcorn voucher and buy a cup so you can get $1.50 refills. I have had a couple of issues with movies breaking down here but all in all it is a great sized theater that I appreciate and really clean!

What a super fun atmosphere! I was surprised at how big it was! The food was worth the wait once you figured out how to order food or drinks which is really confusing! I had an awesome burger that was big enough to be shared. It was fun to be there with a group of people and I am sure it is amazing once there is a band playing too.

I was excited to try this place out since I have yet to find a really good bbq place in my neighborhood since I moved out here. My husband loves bbq. This was not the place to go too. The waitresses were not very happy about us coming in to eat and did not want to explain menu options to us. When we got our food we realized we had over ordered because we were not told portion sizes when asking. Our daughter got a load of food that we would have never gotten if we would have known. Our fries were cold. The sandwiches were good but that was about the only thing good at this location. Not sure if I would go back or not.

This is a great family place! They give you a ball of dough to play with for the kids. I love the meatball and pesto pizza and the house wine is great to drink as well! If you go try to go before they change over to supper that is when the real deals happen!

I was seriously disappointed in this location. We went to celebrate my husband's master degree and I was so bummed that this place let us down. We had reservations but it took 15 minutes to still get a seat. When we were seated the hostess gave us an ipad for wine choices but gave us no help on how to use it. As we were going through and trying to figure stuff out time passed-10, 15, 20, no lets try 30 minutes before I got up and went to the hostess station and complained that we had no drinks, nor had we ordered them yet, and we had a child with us and we were celebrating a special occasion. The manager came over then and explained that the area were we sat was full and only had one waitress, not my problem when I paying what I am. They gave us a bottle of wine on the house then. We finally got our drinks and half the cork was left in the bottle. When our food came it was just mediocre.  The meat we got was fine but I have had better for steak houses, honestly I can say that the Texas Roadhouse does better, and that is not what I should be saying by the standards I have read on this place. I had the prime rib and my husband had a house seasoned one and they were both just okay. My daughter had spaghetti and meatballs and the noodles were rubber. She loves noodles and said she did not want to eat them. Our dessert was the best part of the meal by far! I would go back for dessert if I was forced to but never again for their service or their food. We were by far the youngest people in the place as well and we are in our thirties. Everyone else was retired or elderly-not the sort of crowd we normally eat with either. I am honestly disappointed that we went to celebrate this amazing accomplishment and it turned into a 3 hour ordeal of trying to get a meal put together because they were too busy. Wish they would have told me that when I made the reservations. They also never came back to ask if we wanted more wine or drinks for our party of 5. What a let down.

My family went for the Sunday brunch and it was okay. We were moved to a different table since the one we sat at was dirty. The cost was very expensive for the normal brunch items we received. There was not anything special about what they served. My husband had the french toast and it was rock hard. We stayed until the brunch area closed and had our fill but I think next time we go for brunch I will find a new place that actually watches their morning breakfast line supplies.

Going here for happy hour is the best! They have a good menu at that time as well. I have never gone to pay full price though way too much for me. I always go as a group and have never been disappointed in the food, sometimes the service is slow but the food is always great!

I went back to the yard house after recieving a gift card from my previous post. Not sure if they knew I was coming but I took the whole family for their happy hour specials. My daughters meal started with dessert first which was a frown since I knew she would not anything else. The fruit bar was great but I wish it would not have came before all the rest of the food. We ordered their massive chicken nachoes which were really dried out-glad they had lots of guacamole to go with it. The onion tower was amazing as always. The sliders were good but the fries were cold. My husband also got the boneless wings which had great flavor but were cold. To top it off I had food stuck to the outside of my glass so that was gross too. I appreciated the gift card because of my comment but I think it would be a bit again before we go back. So werid. Before we only had slow service, this was really werid.

Sign up for their emails so you can get free ice cream on your birthday and throughout the year. I love getting their creations and sharing them because they are always huge! So much fun to watch them mix it in front of you too!

We went for their late happy hour and had their amazing pulled pork sliders with sweet potatoe fries. They were delicious. I ordered a glass of wine and did not like it but the waitress easily gave me another selection and was totally fine with it, super nice! I seemed to be out of their normal client base but it was a nice place for happy hour.

When coming in for lunch the waiter explained the service perfectly. We ate off the salad bar and were very satisfied. When it came to the meat experience we were able to taste the amazing flavors of the country. My only compliant is that we asked to try a couple of the other meats that were listed and it took two or three tries before they came out with it. At one time we asked for more bananas four times before we were given more and then 5 plates came out! So their wait staff is a bit off on requests, beyond that it was superb!

This location is small and has probably the fewest toppings in any yogurt shop in the valley. We stopped because it was a yogurt shop that we had not heard of before. It was not busy at all and no one greeted us when we walked in. We did try a couple of the flavors before deciding but none really jumped out to us. The toppings were very limited. My daughter just went with sprinkles, she was disappointed that there was not any bobo balls. I love fruit and it did not look very good. We did not pay very much which was nice but we did not take very much either.

We stopped in for the Sunday buffet brunch and it was great! The shredded beef was my favorite along with the amazing omelet  station. I was happy to see that we have a great buffet for brunches in the west valley. It was not super busy either. My daughter enjoyed all the fresh fruit and my husband thought the enchiladas were great. The music began as we were leaving so we did not get to take part in that. I really enjoyed everything about the food especially the freshness!

It looks super hip and it should be amazing but the food was just okay. Our appetizer was a huge grease fest, we asked if it was supposed to be that way and they took it off our bill but not really ever answered the question. We never got refills on any drinks. They were not that busy either. Perhaps we didn't fit their normal crowd of people but I was bummed, it looked fun but I will pass next time.

The lines alone should show you how amazing the food is at this restaurant! My family loves to eat here. The food comes out and is served in a styrofoam containers which is a let down but do not let that fool you, because the taste is spicy! They have amazing different salsas to taste as well. Do not pass up on desert either, they have the best!

The waterpark itself is great. I like the different areas for all the members of the family to be involved. I only wished that everything was working all the time. It is a bummer when you get there and parts are broken down. It would also be nice if they could maintain the bathrooms better. The food and drinks are mediocre and over priced for sure.

I love that this place has a Saturday happy hour! We came for drinks and an appetizer before going out and it was great! The decor is super fun to watch. They had a move playing in the background as well. Lots of servers were around to help others too! The drinks were yummo and the food was great, we had sweet potato fries. I will totally be back!

The smell of the place took me off at the beginning of the experience. I was shocked-perhaps it was the carpet? No one was there but they still sat us in a far off corner which felt weird as well. We ordered their new pretzel burger which tasted good but was super greasy. I could not eat the whole thing because of the grease, no wonder it tasted good. My daughter got a chicken strip meal and was satisified. For dessert we had the red velvet cupcake but we could have gotten better choices at a grocery store. Don't think I will go out of my way to eat here again. When we left we went to Culver's next door for ice cream and that seemed to make the meal better!

This is the cutest ice cream shop ever! I love going in here and trying their new creations. My husband and daughter also love the choices. I think it is amazing that they are so creative. Their newest edition-the fairy house out front is adorable and I think my daughter could have looked at it for hours! Great scenery and amazing treats!

We have gone off and on to this location for 2 years and love everything about it. The teachers put you at ease with the subject matter taught. Our daughter who is super shy warmed up right away to the coaches. We love the warm water and being able to have 30 minute swim sessions. It is so easy to make up a class missed as well! They are fabulous and I would recommend them to anyone!

This is the first time we took our daughter for brunch and it was such a different place, of course, then the nighttime or happy hour. The music was quieter, the food was better looking, and tasted better. I will totally do brunch again! My daughter loved it! My only reason for not giving 5 was because the service was just okay, we needed drinks and waited forever. Also their prices are very high for a brunch.

This place is small and normally not a place I would even check out but it is local so we took a chance. We were greeted right away and found a table. Super nice waitress working. We ordered wings, pizza, and a cheap pitcher of beer and it was awesome! Best pizza I had in a long time. The garlic wings were fabulous with chunks of garlic stuck to them. We stayed there for over 2 hours just eating and enjoying the company. I will totally be back! I can't wait to take my daughter there too!

Came for the yelp elite event and was super impressed with the changes they had made since the last time I had visited two years ago. The only reason why I did not give it a 5 is I probably won't be able to go back because of the price. It is so expensive for a family to visit. Everything else is great. The interactions with the animals, the clean areas to see everything. It is really fun!

The sandwiches are simply amazing! I could sit and eat them all day. The meat was so tender and moist it melted in your mouth. I also loved the greek salad. I could not get enough of the olives! Such a fun place. So excited they are going to open one on the West Side !

I love shopping at this store. I always get great dresses that are comfy and decently priced. They also have a great selection of preowned clothes in the back too. The acessories and fab as well. I love their selection of earrings and someone they work with or know makes these awesome leather cuffs. They have paintings, incense, candles and so much more. They ladies that work there are great helpers while shopping and super nice to talk to as well!

My family went in to eat on a Sunday night after eating at other My Big Fat Greek Restaurants in the valley. We were seated right away but we waited about twenty minutes to get our drinks and another thirty minutes to get our appetizer. We asked for our daughters sake if we could have her food first after the appetizer and that did not occur. We got our food and it tasted great but when we asked for extra toppings they never brought them. When we were all done we waited and waited for a check. We asked three different people for it including the manager and he gave us the wrong one. They were not busy so I have no idea what was going on. I know we will not return to this location due to their service, the food was great but their service was bad.

The mall is not always the best place for a food review but I really like this place. The people working their are not the happiest but do not allow that to stop you! I totally suggest the berry feta salad with chicken, it is the da bomb because the carmalized nuts are amazing! I always get sweet potato fries and a gyro to share with my daughter as well. Quick service and amazing taste!

Awkward to say the least. We have frequented this location several times because it is close to our weekend errands. On several occurrences there is a female manager working and she seems to hate life as we know it. She is always yelling at her co workers and making your dinning experience feel weird for sure. I called her out on it at the last time we stopped and she said it was because she was up at 3 am that day, ummm you work at a breakfast place, you have to get up early, duh. Beyond that the food and coffee are always great but the place is hardly ever clean. So I would take your food and leave if you can.

You must go during happy hour, to get the most bang for your buck! The pretzel fondue is the bomb! I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and they did a great job with service even with how busy they were. Not sure if I would take my daughter there it seems pretty hipster.

It was totally not busy. The service was totally fine but the food was just okay.  I ordered the bruschetta and it came with at least two cartons of baby tomatoes-it was overloaded. My husband got a meatball sub which was loaded beyond belief with cheese. The chicken tenders meal was okay but a bit greasy for my daughter. We also got wings but had to pay extra for the ranch and blue cheese. Perhaps we will try it again and order something else.

We went in for the Sunday brunch and ended up ordering off the regular menu because it did not have a lot to choose from. The kids menu looked good but my daughter ate most of our pizza. The tea was watered down and the lemonade was way to sour to drink. It was okay but nothing special.

My husband and I went for a Valentine's day paint and it was a great experience. They had nice munchies before we started. We ate and drank wine while they set the items up. We had a great spot but make sure you get their early for a good seat. We were able to get our paint but make sure to get extra! The helpers were very nice and warm. The teacher could have gone a bit more indepth with directions but it was good to follow her when she was done with their paint strokes. Would totally go back!

I have only attended this place for their Sunday brunch but that is what keeps bringing my family back. You are always greeted with smiles and the wait staff is fast and talkative. We enjoy the fact that the brunch is loaded with food and for my husband meat choices. My daughter loves being able to eat all the fresh fruit she can and have a bunch of olives to go with it! My only compliant is that the buffet needs more room, it is often hard to navigate around other people or food.

We went in for lunch and were surprised by how busy this place was on a Saturday. Half of our group got breakfast and the other half got lunch and everyone was happy! The portions were great. The only issue was the lack of flavor in the french fries they were not good at all, really bland and plain. I loved the pastrami burger, it was delicious and I would totally go back and get it again!

We stopped here for Sunday brunch and had no idea how cool it was. It was incredibly busy so we had to wait awhile and when we did order our waitress had no idea what beer was out but it was still yummo! We had a great time and our daughter at the entire french toast, which was awesome! Wish it was closer to this side of town for us, but it was still super fun, will be back if we are on that side of town again!

This little restaurant was a great find downtown. It had great drinks and great food. When we went in there the place was completely dead but that was fine. The food was super good!

Ask for tasting cups to try it out ahead of time. The yogurt is always yummo and the fact that they change the flavors all the time keeps my family coming back. The price is a bit on the high side but they do have a frequent shopper card to use with your phone number so that helps a bit too with the deals they offer. Become a facebook fan so you know about specials as well. I love the fruit yogurts the best! My daughter can not get enough of the bobo balls! The place is small but they do have containers to go as well!

Loved this place and can not wait to go back! The prices were reasonable and the food was great. We tried six different rolls and were stuffed. Everything was fantastic.The sake bomb was good and so was the plum wine to top it off. There was hardly anyone in there but it was nice to have a lot of different choices to pick from. I wish we would know all the rolls on the belt but I would continue to eat more!

A bit confusing when you come in. You can order from the counter or you can sit down and grab a menu, it was busy so it was hard to tell. When ordering we started with dessert first, chocolate covered strawberries, delicious! We each had a sandwich and they were great. A kids menu would be nice but we might have missed it. Cute inside with the old Coke decor. Will go back when it isn't as busy to try out some more stuff!

Amazing and super fun! This place was packed but we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table at their busy time of night on a Saturday. The crowd was very hip and the atmosphere was fun. We sat there for at least two hours grazing on antipasto tray and pretzels with cheese dip. I found a new bear that I love and I can't wait to go back!

I agree with a lot of the other comments but for a family friendly place it was great. The 3-d movie was for my daughters first 3d experience. It was quick and to the point. The butterfly garden was great. It was humid but the misters helped and there were so many amazing butterflies. My daughter loved taking photos and trying to get them to land on her. I wish there would have been more info on the different types of butterflies. When we left the butterfly garden we went in to see the bees and ants which were very small and I wish there was more info on them too. The water tanks were cool but the sting ray pool was not even working either. More info would be great but we will be back again for sure!

Stopped in for my first time before going to a movie and was very happily surprised. I was not sure what I was going to be getting with the title of the place but it reminded me a lot of Chipolte. I love their peri peri sauce though, it was truly delicious! The tortilla chips were a bit greasy which was a bummer. They do give discounts with your movie tickets so remember to keep them for next time.  My daughter liked the food but was bummed out that they did not serve milk. I know we will go back for the sheer reason that that sauce was da bomb!

This is the second time we stayed here and it was totally different! We got in early which was great. Last time we took a cooler to the pool and was fine. This time when we did it the security asked us to leave, when asked about it compared to last time they told us that if we did not take it out we would leave. It was rude right away. We were going to do it but just surprised. When we went to the floor to gamble we were told we could not bring beverages down. Last time we did. Not sure what the deal was. I wish they were just talking to each other so we could know what to do if we go again or not! The hotel room had a phone that did not work. A tv that was on the fritz the whole time and we could not get wifi, even called for help! It was a yucky staycation experience!

The environment is fun! The food is okay. The drinks are overpriced and don't taste the best. The waitress knew a ton about the menu from others taste pallets but never tried anything it seemed like. Which was about all she seemed to know. Our order was wrong several times when it arrived. Perhaps going back will be better once they are more established.

I went in for a coverup and met with Johnny. He came up with an amazing design, way better than I would have imagined. I came back in for my actual tattoo and three hours later I walked out with an amazing piece of artwork. Johnny was very professional, made me feel comfortable and worked well with me. I can't wait to go back!

If you have children please, please stay away from this location. This is my second review of this location-just a heads up. We went there tonight, a Sunday night, no game, no activites and we had the worst service imaginable. We sat in the patio and asked three waitresses after 15 minutes who our server was because we had our 3 year old with us. No one knew. When we were getting ready to get up to leave to another restaurant another patron said he would ask his waitress, he did and she served us. It was not her section and she was new, fine, we appreciated that. She didn't know what was on draft but it did not matter since we were hungry and thirsty. After another 15 minutes she brought out the wrong beer order. After another 15 minutes our food came but not our childs. We asked the server and they said we never put it in, whatever. So we ordered again. While we were waiting someone who was a manager type but did not introduce themseleves that way, came and said they would rush the order but never said sorry! The waitress came back and apologized but we said our distress was the fact that our daughter had no food! The waitress left and came back 5 minutes later saying that our daughters food would be comp'd. Not anything else! We were given the wrong beer, waited way to long for service, saw 3 waitresses that would NOT even help us, and the manager type never said sorry! What a joke! As we were leaving the patron that helped get us a waitress told us he was sorry that we encountered that with our family! We left hungry because they never came and asked us if we wanted anything else! This honestly has been the worst service I have been given in the valley and there was no excuse since they were not even busy! I get that staff might be new but with all the other challenges it was a total waste! We should have just left and ate some place else. STAY AWAY! I will never eat at this location again! I will go back to Goodyear or Surprise where their costumer service is INCREDIBLY better, what a let down.

We came in as a family after the Phoenix Comicon and found out the place was totally dead. There was a great coupon for an appetizer for free from Yelp, thanks! Our food was out quickly. They didn't check up on us a ton but we were still okay with the rest of our service. We will totally go back for happy hour!

Simply amazing! I had the green chile stew with a plain fry bread and I was blown away with how awesome it was. The place is a little run down and there are no lights outside to tell you that the place is even there but it is so worth it. Make sure you get dessert too!

This is a great place! It is super cute and well decorated, very hip. The people working the wines were incredible at describing them to us and discussing what we liked in wines. We had 4 tastings and their appetizer plate and left with a couple bottles of wine. I will totally be back!

I can't wait to go back here. We stopped for lunch on the weekend and I saw they had a brunch menu, for sure I want to check that out. The food was amazing. We had a little bit of everything. The fries were the bomb! We also had a pizza and our daughter loved the pigs in the blanket. It was very fun and hipster!

This is always a fun place to be. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the noise level was crazy the last time we visited and we had the hardest time talking to each other while eating. The food is always great-you need to have the rattlesnack bites for sure!

We have eaten here three times and each time it is great! The fish tacos are outstanding. My hubby hates fish but loves them. Margaritas are spot on too! Family friendly to the max during the daytime.

We went here for brunch. We ordered 5 different items before they actually had something in stock. We actually went from the breakfast menu to the dinner menu. Our daughter loved her pancakes but our food was so greasy. The decor in the recent is very dated and the bathrooms are scary!  I am revamping my review after the follow up post so that the Owner can see my comments and make aware to others-the reason why we Yelp. We went to this restaurant because it was reviewed and had good reviews, we were just surprised. We did not attend yesterday, but I did write the review yesterday because I had time to write it up. We actually went 2 weeks ago on a Saturday after all of the BBQ items were off the menu because BBQ night is Friday apparently. I would NEVER hold it against anyone for the weather conditions as we had on 9/8/14. Honestly that is ridiculous. NO ONE saw that storm coming nor did they realize what was going to happen. But that was NOT when we visited this location.  When I make a comment about the renovations, it is my opinion. I was confused by the laminated discs hanging on the wall and the blue room across, that is my opinion, and I am entitled to it. Part of being on yelp is making comments about the ambience of a room-unless I have understood that wrong. I love retro and vintage but that was not what was happening at this location.   We will not be back. I honestly can say I did not feel that my food was "fresh" I had a greasy ruben that was underheated and french fries that were limp. As I stated before my daughter loved her pancake and was excited about eating it, that is why I gave 1 star. My husband had a burger and it was greasy as well and the beans he had on the side were worse than Bush's Baked Beans-or perhaps they were the same thing, he honestly could not tell and he did not finish them.   Hopefully this 2nd review clears up any issues you have with my OPINION on YELP!

If you are ready to start your weightloss journey this is the place to start and end your journey with! The people working here are amazing. You could not ask to be with more knowledgable and courteous people. These two ladies are fantastic at their jobs and making you feel comfortable about the whole process. They are amazing at making the schedule work for you as well. Easy to follow guidelines and easy to appointments. I look forward to having my weekly meeting!

Wonderful BBQ. I love the brisket and the BBQ sauce to try out is amazing. My daughter loves the bannana pudding dessert. I can't get enough of the sweet tea either. My only complaint is the tables are always dirty, it would be great if someone would go around and wipe them down between patrons.

Waited forever for a table which is normally a sign that this will be a good place-no so much. The waitress dumped the sample of beer on my leg. Didnt even get napkins to help clean up, just laughed it off. The pretzels were great, that is why they get 2 stars. The food was super greasy and I could not finish my meal because it was so unsatisfying.  The live music was nice as well.

You have to check this place out if you go to Westgate, it is a must! Take your child their for the kid's meal and they get to keep the frisbee which is fabulous! It is so much fun to try the different flavors and watch them make the donuts.

Great gyros! Delicious for sure! The rice was dried out that is why I could not give it a 5 but totally would go back just for the yummy gyro and awesome sauce!

Such a fun place to check out. Try the shrimp and the mussels for sure! The seasoning is amazing and the smell over takes the entire restaurant. The cajun fries are totally worth the price and are spicy beyond belief! I can't wait to go back! The only reason why I couldn't give it a full 5 stars was that some of our mussels were not cooked all the way through and our bill was messed up.

Super fun! I love the idea of making my own pizza and getting it back super fast. My daughter loved being able to watch them make it. We did the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was spicy! Totally plan on going back!

The only reason I can't give it five stars is because of how slow the service is but it was worth the wait. The yakisoba noodles and the garlic noodles are great. The terriyaki sauce is delicious too. My daughter loved the edamae and the chicken kids meal.

They give you a reasonable price for your trendy clothes and do a great job explaining the process. The clothes they have for sale are normally in a great price range too, they really have something for everyone which is awesome. I have shopped there twice now and always find something to come home with. Super fun!

We checked it out because we had a coupon for a free pizza. It was at lunch time and they were totally busy. The pizza making process went really fast and they had tons of toppings to choose from. When the pizzas came out of the oven it was a different story though. It seemed like the person that was supposed to call out the pizzas was slammed with orders and not sure which went where. It did not help that the leader, perhaps the manager was yelling at him. It made it really awkward. I felt bad and that is the only reason why I cant give 5 stars. I will be back and I hope that there is more team work for the people working their totally adds the the atmosphere. The pizza was great! I had #4 and it was totally delicious. I love that they had mini pizzas for kids too. They overcooked the garlic bread we had but gave us another one because of it without us saying anything. I also totally enjoyed their delicious lemonades!

I can't give it a 5 star because it does not have a kids meal. This place needs kids meals! The food was really delicious. I had their hot beef and was not disappointed. I think it is a bit ridiculous to pay extra for the peppers and not be told about it but the sandwich was great. My daughter enjoyed the plain hot dog as well.

I am super happy there is one of these close to home. They have super slow service and that is why I cant give this a 5 stars but they just opened and working out the kinks still so I want to give them so room to grow. The food is still high quality and tastes great! The pizza is super fun to make from all the different combinations that are available. I like being able to watch what is occurring with the building of the pie too! The salads look great as well but I need to check that out next time!

Save your time and go to Dave and Busters! I took my daughter to check it out over spring break. We went right when it opened up thinking that wouldn't be a problem. We were the only people eating at 11 am but to my surprise the server was confused with what we were ordering versus who ever was talking in his ear with the ear piece. Our food came out and I was disappointed. The parmesan chips are disgusting. The sliders were very over priced. My daughter had a pizza and it was just ok. I had ordered a margarita and they forgot it and then finally got it at the end of the meal. When I went to pay they didn't have change. Ridiculous! Then we went to play games-this is the only reason they get two stars, they had some new games that I have not seen in Dave and Busters but the rest of it was overpriced! I didnt bowl or check out laser tag. Not sure if I will go back to do so.
