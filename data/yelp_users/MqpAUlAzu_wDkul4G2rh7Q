Toes were done decently although it seemed to take longer than expected. I was in the pedi chair for about an hour. Because i was getting a shellac manicure, they assumed i already had shellac on and without checking began to file the tops of my nails. I stopped her immediately. French manicure came out horrible which is the main reason for the two stars. The last confirmed the thickness after a couple nails done and then my fault for not checking the rest before baking it on. Half my nail bed is white. Yuck.

Horrible. Service inside was so slow and preference was clearly given to the drive thru. caramel macchiato was so bad i had to pretty much spit out the first sip. Got my refund but i highly doubt ill be back.

Love, love, love my experience here. Jill was great and did my hair perfectly. Very reasonably priced which allows for a more generous tip. Can't wait to go back!

Wonderful service! Got my husband in quickly after he had a back injury. It was organized, clean, and a friendly, knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend!
