This is by far the worst airline! Rude customer service... The manager at the PHx airport is such a B***.. When I asked a question.. They look at you in disgust... As if you are supposed to know all the answers... I have been stuck here for almost 8 hours with no explanation! Never ever will I fly this airline again!

This place is awesome! Love the setting, love the lighting, and the food is to die for! The only problem I have is that when you have a big party, you can't split the checks... You have one bill and take all the credit cards... It doesn't make sense.. I'm supposed to be enjoying my food and company but yet I have to sit there and calculate how much each person owes plus tip plus tax? They didnt even do it for you... or offered.. We're in 2013... I would go back but only if its for a party of two...

I used to LOvE this place.... It's was quick, efficient, and great customer service.  We went today to get our car washed.  There was a long wait for what seemed like ten cars.  the staff were arguing about which car is which, the managers didn't  handle the situation... The car looked worse than when we brought it in.. They didn't vacuum. Properly. Thanks to the "raid" this place went downhill... Not coming back...
