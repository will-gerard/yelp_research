In a world filled with Petsmarts and Petcos, where they charge more than $10 for a tiny stuffed animal that my dogs will destroy in less than half an hour, Ryan's Pet Supply is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.   Phoenix should be thanking it's lucky stars that this wonderful website's warehouse is so close by. Think of Ryan's as a Costco for pets. The more you buy the better the deal. I go every three months or so to stock up on treats, teeth wipes, treats and accessories. The aisles can be difficult to maneuver but the guys there filling online orders are super nice and are happy to show you where to find things. Helpful tip: Carry your catalog with you. Prices are not displayed.  The people at the registers sometimes seem rushed but they are really nice. Oh, and leave your giant purse or backpack behind. They won't let you take it back into the warehouse but will let you check it at the front desk. Bring your wallet though. They have a $25 minimum purchase but I've never gotten out of there under $100.  Go to Ryan's if you have dogs to spoil. I know I have 24 squeaker balls to show for my last visit.  Only one negative - I went there three times looking to purchase a gate to keep my Boxer mix and Mastiff mix out of one part of the house and Ryan's didn't have it. Ended up buying it online from another retail. Moral of the story: call before if you want to buy a bigger ticket item.

We're going to find a different nail place in the Ahwatukee area next time we need a mani/pedi.   Although the staff was very nice I was rushed through both my pedicure and manicure despite there being no wait (but it was a full house). I was done with both the pedicure and manicure by the time my mom was done with her pedicure.  My feet were left rough and polish was sloppy. The polish for my manicure was bubbly and not cleaned from my cuticles.   Pricing is average compared to similar nail salons.

I have had two appointments at Advanced Arthritis Care & Research (so far) and have loved both experiences.   The office staff on site is super sweet and uplifting. They always end the phone call with, "Have a blessed day." Somehow they make paperwork a happy experience and haven't had me in the waiting room longer than 10 minutes despite my getting there for my appointment early. They lost a star because I left a message on a monday afternoon and never got a call back.  I have been seeing the nurse practitioner, Maria Nasta, FNP-C, who has been one of the best caregivers I've worked with and I've seen many. She is thorough, asks lots of questions and really wants to get to the bottom of the problem. Where most caregivers have seen me out with a prescription and a farewell, Maria gave me alternative treatment ideas, an order for lab work to learn more about the root cause and a goal for the next appointment.   We are so close to an answer and I look forward to working with Advanced Arthritis Care & Research and Maria to get that answer.

Worst gym ever (said like the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons)  I have so many bad things to say about this gym that I am just going to list a few of them here to avoid losing my cool.   1) This place is super hot in the summer because they don't like to turn on all the A/C units.  2) NO ONE cleans off machines after using them and staff could care less.  3) Sales staff is extremely pushy. They like to be the ones to scan you in so they can ask every single day if I want a fitness screening. No, I just want to work out. You asked me yesterday.  4) Peak hours are so busy a line wraps down the staircase just to use an elliptical/treadmill.  5) Parking is a pain in the rear. People are so desperate for a parking spot up front - come on, you're going to a gym... WALK - they hold up traffic on Scottsdale road to wait for someone to pull out of a spot.   That's all I can say for now without typing in more caps. I miss Mountainside fitness.

Olive & Ivy, though somewhat hidden in the mix of Old Town Scottsdale and Scottsdale Fashion Square, is a popular restaurant frequented by 50-somethings trying to look like 30-somethings and 20-somethings showing off all of their 20-somethingness. The sunglasses are big, the shopping bags more expensive than I can afford over a lifetime and the tans as dark as they come.   The atmosphere is swanky and there is often a Jason Mraz wannabe playing his music just inside the door. I've been seated, at one point or another, in each room of the restaurant. The red room in the rear near the pizza oven can be a bit tight but is a nice choice if you want to hear each other from across the table. The main dining area can get pretty loud - but it makes for great people watching. The white room has a lot of appeal with its large chairs and high cloth-draped walls. The problem is, as I was seated here for a client dinner, is that the humongous circular table creates a yelling match across the tables. Don't make any important business deals here. Maybe it would be better for a bridal shower. Eh. It's cool looking.  The waitresses are attentive and deliver drinks and pesto and bread dip in a timely manner. The bread/dip combo is delicious! I would go just for that if I could. I usually order the flatbreads. My favorite is the prosciutto with arugala. Delicious!   Olive & Ivy also has a cafe/market that is great for lunch. If I'm feeling simple I get the grilled cheese which is always satisfying or I get one of their delicious sandwiches.  Overall a great place to eat and be seen, a perfect combo for Scottsdale!

This narrow restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall in Tempe near ASU. Popular among the hippy type, it reminds me of my time in Portland, OR. There are only a handful of two seater tables and one long bar for seating. The restaurant fills up fast at dinner time and is a very tight fit to try to find an open seat among patrons and servers.   I ordered the Royale with Cheese. I would have liked to have it without mushrooms but the pasties are pre-made so no changes or substitutions can be made. Luckily the mushrooms were pretty big and easy to pick out. The pasty was delicious overall but the meat was a bit salty. The menu says it has french fries but they are really just potatoes cut like fries and not actually deep fried. I liked that. I was afraid the french fries would make it too greasy but they were a great addition.   My friend had a Cottage Pie Pasty. He said it was delicious and had no complaints. The red wine sauce complimented it well.  As I noted above, this place can get pretty busy and the servers run around like crazy serving and bussing tables. Service isn't superb but the food really makes up for it. Go here and you won't be disappointed.

A large portion of the household income is pumped into this store. We have two large dogs (a boxer mix and a mastiff mix) that need to be fed, treated and played with. Petsmart is the one stop shop to get that all done with the convenience of being a short drive from the house. I know there are many specialty pet stores or boutiques that carry the things I need but when I don't have the time to run all over town I just hit up Petsmart and pay the higher prices so my dogs can be happy in a hurry.   I have attended two courses of the training program that proved rather successful. My pup learned the basic commands... sit, stay, leave it. The trainer was kind and patient with both dog and owner. I would recommend the course to anyone with a new dog. It is rather inexpensive and, let me emphasize this again, convenient.

This has been my favorite vet I've ever been to, or rather, my pets have ever been to. I have never had a problem getting an appointment. Even when it is an emergency they have never had a problem getting in within an hour without having to pay the emergency fee.   Some vets here are better than others and when it's an emergency it's a crap shoot as to who you end up seeing but they all seem to be concerned about your pet. The girls at the front desk get you in a room almost as soon as you walk in the door and I have never felt rushed during the appointment.  I have a bit of a difficult case in one of my dogs and the staff is never scared or intimidated by her. They are happy to get a muzzle and skip the weigh in if they see that my dog is very scared to be there. Only once have I had a vet that wanted to write her off. Most vets have been optimistic and understanding.   Unless something extremely out of character happens I have no plans to see another vet. I would continue to go to University Animal Hospital even if I moved outside of Tempe.

I've been to this location Massage Envy on several occasions. The massage therapist, Traci, did a great job. She listened to my preferences and administered a relaxing and effective massage. I will certainly be going back to her again.  The reception area is small and can get pretty packed on the hour as clients are completing their massage and others going in. The girls behind the counter get flustered easily so I suggest making sure they charge correctly. It's interesting that sometimes having to deal with the cashiers post-massage can ruin the experience due to going from true relaxation to the hustle and bustle of the waiting room.   If not for Traci's wonderful work I may have given 3 stars.

I can't say enough about this wonderful pizza place tucked away in the Hilton Village. I try to stop for a pie after a massage but I would drive half way across the world for just a taste of this delicious delicacy.   My first visit was prompted by a post on Facebook. My friend frequently posted that she was there with her family. I thought, "Oh, another kid's pizza joint with rubbery crust and crumbled cheese." I was happily mistaken. The pizza was delicious and the atmosphere was tasteful and worthy or a date-night. It is somewhat small inside but they have plenty of outdoor seating accompanied by any and all weather accessories (roll down shade, heaters, fans, etc.).  The first pizza I tried at Humble Pie was the Potato & Roasted Garlic with fontina, gorgonzola, rosemary. I was surprised that this wood fired potato pizza wasn't soggy or droopy. It was amazing. My next trip I had The Egg Pizza, which sounds scary but isn't. It was like breakfast on a pizza! You can't beat that!  The service can be slow at times but I have patience and I don't notice as much when I'm stuffing my face with their perfectly crunchy but chewy pizza crust.   Minus one star for empty cups and late checks but 4 stars for wonderful food. I would recommend to everyone (and I have)!

Mojo. I love you. Those other yogurt places try to tempt me with crazy new flavors but I can't do that to you. You're always there for me... clean and welcoming. To go to the other chain self-dispense yogurt dessert places (which shall remain unnamed) would be cheating. You've always given me stamps to make me come back for more and I do! You offer me super discounts with my light rail card and I use them. How could I go wrong? Please, Mojo, maintain your flashback appearance and your delicious go-to flavors (like birthday cake and white boy vanilla) and I will be loyal and I will tell all my friends about you. Your Mill Ave location is the best. The staff is friendly and there's never a crumb in sight. See you next Saturday night Mojo. Keep the fire burning for me.

I know I promised Mojo just recently that I wouldn't cheat on them but I have to admit that I visited my local Yogurtland this weekend.   We showed up around 8pm and the place was packed. There were college kids, families and softball teams, oh my! People love this place. I had to be pushy and interrupt the one visible employee there (who was busy ringing up everyone at the register) for sample cups. I tried a few and chose the red velvet flavor. The toppings seemed really fresh and were much larger pieces than what Mojo offered.   Overall my experience was pretty good. There were many yogurt flavors and topping choices. The store didn't seem as well kept as Mojo. The machines were covered in drippy yogurt and the toppings all over the counter. It would have also been nice if there was an employee on the sales floor to help new customers with the process. I think I may go again but hope the cleanliness and customer service is improved on.

Okay... Panchero's Mexican Grill is my new obsession. Truth be told, I avoided it for the longest time because I didn't think any burrito place could compete with Chipotle. Boy was I wrong!  Panchero's wins hands down in the showdown with Chipotle mostly because of their freshly pressed tortillas. They are so scrumptious that my mouth starts to water as soon as they pull the dough ball off of the tray. The tortillas is complemented by always fresh ingredients and completed with a swirl with the bob tool. Love the bob tool! Chipotle burritos always have layers but a Panchero's burrito insides are mixed so every bite has all the flavors.   I will admit to going to Chipotle once after discovering Panchero's but I only went after much kicking and screaming. If only the had an iPhone app similar to Chipotle's. They have an app now but it only allows you to play a burrito making game rather than place an order.

Cafe Conmigo is located in the lobby of the Galleria Corporate Centre in Scottsdale and uber-convenient for a quick bite or coffee before/after work or just to get away from the computer for a few minutes. I have only recently started going to Cafe Conmigo but loved each experience. The staff is always friendly, even at 7:30 in the morning! You can certainly expect to see me there from now on. Meet your new 'regular', Cafe Conmigo!

Despite living nearly next door to a Dunkin Donuts I had to make the drive to Bosa Donuts.   Not wanting to get out of the car in my slippers and pajama pants we used the drive-thru. The menu was difficult to see because the plastic cover on the display was sun burned and blurry. We ordered some classics knowing there was no way they couldn't have them.  The maple long john was delicious. I haven't seen maple long johns at Dunkin Donuts in a long time so I was loving it. The chocolate frosting could be better but I can't complain too much about chocolate frosting... I mean, come on, it's chocolate frosting! My friend wasn't impressed with the apple fritter. It was crunchy and too sugary.   Here's the kicker. The basic glazed doughnut was amazing. It was so close to a Krispy Kreme doughnut you could have fooled me in a blind taste test. It was perfectly glazed and collapsed just like the best of the best upon first bite.  Next time I have a doughnut craving I will skip the neighborhood Dunkin and ride over to Bosa.
