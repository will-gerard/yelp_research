Love appetizers and drinks at the Capital bar!  The calamari with peppers is excellent, and you can't beat their signature pineapple infused vodka (Stoli Doli) martini! The staff is friendly and attentive. If you like a steakhouse with a warm wood ambiance and outstanding food, this is the place for you!

Quaint, friendly coffee house! Love their coffee (iced and hot) and iced pomegrante green tea!

Going back to LaGrande today to buy their famous English Muffins to take to family in Texas. Know that this place is very busy, but the food is certainly worth the wait. I especially like purusing their gift and foodie department!!

I loved this place! We are big fans of Walt Richardson and his music first of all, and he was playing today. But, add in delicious tapas (really fresh-loved all of our choices, especially goat cheese and fig) for a wonderful experience. I tasted my friend's $5 Sunday white Sangria and had to have one of my own. There were blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, lemon, etc. in it, and it was super good!! The atmosphere was trendy. Next time we'd like to try to reserve the couch for seating in front of the entertainment. Very cool.

I can't say enough about this great spot! We were here for drinks and cookies (made next door). Even though this place is always busy, it doesn't take us long to check out. Everything is 5 star!!

I was very disappointed in the haircut I received recently. After giving my stylist explicit instruction on what parts of my hair to cut, she cut my hair way too short all over. I tried to control what she was doing, but she went on cutting anyway.

Extraordinary views at this beautiful Sanctuary resort and spa. The bar was elegant yet relaxed. The complimentary wasabi peanuts were delish and my Chardonnay very nice. The background music was a perfect volume, and the low lighting gave the bar great ambiance. Great spot for sunset and a cocktail!!!

I am writing this review waaaay too late. Been going to the a Wright Bar at the Biltmore for probably 4 years when visiting our son in the Biltmore area. Well, now he's moving to San Diego. We went to the Bar last weekend for a Bon voyage drink. The bartenders are very friendly and super helpful (I.e. Like when you lose your phone!). Drinks are a bit pricey but very good!! The ambience is classic-recently renovated! Some nights we've been there, we have enjoyed live music. The bar is always hopping-great for people watching! Good-bye, dear Wright Bar. Hopefully, I'll make it back some day!

Had a great meal tonight at Citizen's. We were looking for something light, so we started out with the tzatziki and hummus appetizer served with grilled pita bread. It was excellent. I would definitely get it again. I then had the grilled cheese sandwich with a tasty cherry spread--very gourmet! I tasted my friend's chopped salad which was incredible. It was not your ordinary chopped salad, as it had couscous, smoked salmon, corn, etc. I would definitely order this salad when I visit again. The atmosphere had a clean, uptown look with nice, low lighting. What was unique about this place was its interesting menu. I loved all the new foods I tried tonight!
