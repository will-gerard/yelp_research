I am VERY disappointed in my experience with this company. In fact this is the first review I've ever written on YELP, that's how much I want to express my frustration. My friend and I purchased a groupon for the one hour pottery class, and the ability to paint a premade pot at the end of the class. Everything went well and we had a good time. We did the class on a Saturday afternoon, and they told us our pots would be available for pick up on the following Tuesday. I went to pick them up after work around 5pm. Upon walking in, four employees were chatting a few feet away from me. I was not acknowledged or greeted for over 5 full minutes. FINALLY one of them asked if I needed help (obviously), I told them I was there to pick up our pots. Their response was " we are not open today, you need to come back," what?!? The big sign right when you pull in says "open daily!"  I saw the pots we painted less than 5 feet from where I was standing, I pointed to my pots and nicely asked if I could please take them with me now. They REFUSED!! I was beyond shocked! I went out of my way to drive there, and they wouldn't let me take MY pots that I PAID for that were sitting right in front of where I was standing?! I left feeling very upset. I don't even want to go back now to claim them, especially since they don't even abide by the hours that they set!! No wonder the entire backyard of their building is FILLED with "unclaimed pots," they don't even let people pick them up! Completely unprofessional, stay away!

I cannot say enough good things about this business and about Andrew. Prior to me discovering German Motor Works, I was being ripped off and taken advantage of by the BMW dealership. Every time my service engine light came on, I would leave the dealership with a bill of at least $2,000 each time. The last time I was at BMW they wrote a list of 5 things I needed replaced. I was skeptical so I brought my car to Andrew. He said only ONE of the things needed to be done, and he fixed it at a FRACTION of the price BMW was going to do it for! I have literally saved thousands since I started going to German Motor Works. Andrew is the most honest person ever and I have 100% trust that I am in great hands, and NEVER have to be worried about being taken advantage of. I cannot recommend this place enough. I wish there were more than 5 stars to give. Thank you so much for the superior service!!
