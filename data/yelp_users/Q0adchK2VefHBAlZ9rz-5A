I've been here a few times now with some friends and I'm unsure if I like it or not. I do think they do a good job with my toes and nails, but the place is a bit dirty and not properly kept.   There isn't a cash register. All the money is kept in one of the techs drawers. It's just loose money. Every time cash is needed, the owner has to go there and even if she has a client, he was to stop the service to get change.   The tools they use for pedicure is a bit odd. Magazine papers below your feet if you're getting a special pedicure. Small cut up pool noodle to prop feet up while they scrub. (and I'm pretty sure this is what it is), A zester (like the one you use to zest lemons) as a foot scrubber for callus.   Not sure how 'to-code' that is.

I'm not usually a fan of RA and chain type places, but I find that their sashimi assortment (lunch menu) is delicious. The fish is very buttery and fresh. Lunch is served quickly and I visit it ~2 times a month during my lunch break.

Cute little shop with very good coffee and food as well. I liked how quirky everything was and there are many places to sit. I would suggest that they have a form of menu or central area where it's obvious you go to pay. They have a daily menu, it seems like, that is taped on the glass near the display case. There's a lot going on so difficult to see that. From the street, it's not easy to know where the front door is. I would definitely come back but with expectation to pay a lot. It's very expensive there!

It was recommended that we go here. I was here for a girlfriends going away dinner. It was exceptionally oily. I had ravioli with artichoke. It was soaked in sauce and I had to dig for the ravioli. My friends had eggplant with layered meat sauce in between and she sent it back. It was all oil. The waitress said that they would definitely not refund her.... Probably the most rude thing I have heard. My other friend didn't speak up and just took the meal home but definitely didn't eat it. Very oily. I would not go here again or recommend it.

50/50 here.  I walked in with probably 120 books. They were only able to 'accept' about 20 of them and offered me either 90$+ for in store credit or 11$ cash. Since I'm moving out of the country, 11$ is all I got. I don't know how that works, 90$ is suddenly 11$.   The books they didn't 'accept', would be donated to the prison and given as reading material for the inmates. Looks like they will be reading Skinny Bitch and decorating tips books!

I've been coming here for years when I lived in FH and now when I visit my parents. The previous owners were great, it quickly became our favorite sushi place in town and nearby scottsdale. With the new owners, I'd like to say wow. The fish is so fresh. The previous owners had good fish but this is superb. We rank this probably one of the best sushi restaurants in the valley. We prefer to do the sushi combo because the chef picks the most fresh fish and it's amazing every time. This is now a must go when I visit my parents.

My eyebrows turned out amazing. She made them as symmetrical as I've ever had them before, which is very difficult to do since no one is perfect and even our bones are different in each eye. It was pretty painless and took less than 10 mins. Definitely making this my spot. The loyalty card also helps :-)

Love the feel here. It's noon right now and the sun is not directly above me. The church next door does a great job blocking the sun but there are still many areas of light so everything is beautiful outside! Live the home feeling here. The healthy food options is amazing. Love the menu and how cute and well put together everything is. I ordered the muscle malt protein shake. Yum. Also BBQ chicken salad. Delicious. The bowls they give you are recycled and everything just feels better here. Did not bring my computer to test to wifi and work a little but will next time!  Update: don't know why I keep coming here. They are very disorganized with bringing out food at the same time. Waited an extra 20 mins to get my drink, while the rest of my party was served and other tables too. Their beer salad also has different dressing than the one in scottsdale. Not sure if that's intentional or not...

I went here today with my husband for a late breakfast. I've been it pop over but never had the time to go and today was the perfect day for that. There is a small parking lot, but not many spaces. With the other restaurants popping up right next to it, I can see that parking will be an issue in the future, if it's not already.  I loved the decor. They did a great job with creating different areas to sit and different type of sitting and interactions. The outside is nice. Although it's very 'hipster', it's super clean. I LOVE that. One thing I don't like about Cartel is that everything is hardly staying together. It's very dirty there. But Sip is great. They have a nice beer selection and coffee too.   We had a breakfast sandwich, breakfast burrito, iced coffee, and a cinnamon swirl cake. The cake was AMAZING. May need to stop by during lunch to get it again... or every day =]  The burrito was good and although unusual to add sausage, it was nice. I liked that they gave you tomatillo salsa (could be tangier) and sour cream. Tomatillo salsa doesn't get enough credit.   I would give them a 5 if they didn't have cartel. I find their beans to be sour and not the freshest.   Will definitely be going back here again for group nights and lunch during work. I would also like to go during the nights they have open mic and music events. That's one thing I miss from Tucson- coffee shops were a place to meet new people and learn something new. Kudos, Sip!  Their kiosk is also cool. Looking into doing the same thing for my business.  I had planned to take a photo of the cake but it was gone before I could snap a photo! SO GOOD.

Exceptionally slow service. This is now the second time that our crepes have taken over 25 mins to get out. The first time we were one of 3 people at the restaurant. This time though, I even saw the crepes being pulled out of a drawer. If you aren't making the crepes fresh, then why does it take so long? Adding chocolate and marshmallows isn't that time consuming.
