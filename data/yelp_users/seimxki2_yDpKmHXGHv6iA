Go somewhere else or have the neighborhood kids wash it for you - they'll do a better job, I can promise you that! I brought in my brand new white car and there were black marks on my windshield and trunk, windshield/mirrors had smudge marks. The interior definitely failed the "white glove" test. There were water drops all over my backseat. I asked if the guy could re-clean my cup holder as there was a mark from a wet cup and all he did was blow air into it. They didn't bother to lift up the car seat to vacuum under it. The 2 kids vacuuming seemed as if they were racing to see who could finish their side first - and no, it wasn't busy, I was the only car waiting to be vacuumed. Don't waste your money on their more than half a** "wash"!

Came here with my husband in August for an anniversary treat. They were very accommodating with our last minute couples massage request. One of the ladies even stayed later than her shift just so we could enjoy a couples massage as opposed to 2 single massages. Nice staff, clean, good prices, & amazing massages!

My husband and I's new favorite restaurant!! Great customer service and even better food! All of their flatbreads are amazing and the mocha madness is my favorite so far (a must for coffee lovers)!

This place definitely earned my vote! Delicious food! I ordered the spaghetti with sausage (comes with a salad and garlic bread) and mozzarella sticks. My dinner was delivered in the timeframe they gave me on the phone and it was at the perfect temperature. Amazing food! A must try!

Came in last Tuesday for the Basic Car Wash. Their register was broken down so I had to run to the ATM at the convenient store next door for cash. But other than that, my car came out clean and shiny! The boys cleaning the cars seemed to be in a good mood and one of the guys (I'm assuming the supervisor) checked each car to ensure they were being cleaned properly before handing off to each customer. Great customer service as far as the car washes go!! (The girl inside at the register had no smile or facial expression and seemed to dislike her job.)

Great service at this location! I've ordered for delivery from this location 3 times within the past 4 months and each time was great. Delivery took 13 minutes to get to me. I order the Club Lulu with avocado added and tastes amazing every time!
