VISIT Tuesday dinner service, main dining room  FOOD On par with other NNY locations. Not great, but not bad. Although, my 7yo made a point to compliment the server on how much she liked the pretzel rolls on her sliders.  SERVICE Friendly, but PAINFULLY slow. We sat for about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us or took our drink order. I felt abandoned many times. I had to sit there and stare at my salad (once I finally got it) for a while before they brought silverware. It took about 20 minutes between the time I said we were done and the time I got the bill, after reminding her once in-between. What should have been a 1 hour visit, easily turned into 2.  DECOR In a word: depressing. I felt like I was sitting in my great grandmother's barn. It's just one, big, drab, loud, bright, dingy room. There were a couple pictures of New York on the wall, and some TVs. Otherwise, we might as well have been sitting in an elementary school cafeteria.  I will probably never go again -- not with the number of other great choices in the area.

Geico Roadside Assistance hooked me up with them twice now for towing. Even ended up with the same driver both times. Great service! The driver was very fast and friendly. Highly recommended.

Rainforest Cafe has been one of my favorite places to go for many years. Yes, it's a little cheesy, but I always thought it was fun. I've been to a handful of locations around the country and the experience has always been generally pleasant. Yes, it's expensive for mediocre food, and the service is generally slow, but I always thought the fun atmosphere made up for that. I especially found the multiple fish tanks compelling. I often insisted on being seated next to one. However, I believe the love affair has ended. I went to the Tempe location last night for my daughter's birthday dinner. I was very surprised and disappointed to find no fish. None at all. Gone. Where there used to be tanks in the dining area are now covered with fake flowers. The huge circular tanks at the entrance and gift shop...now just filled with bubbles. I've seen the animatronic animals dozens of times. It's always the same. The one detail that made every visit different was the fish. Now I really have no compelling reason to ever go back. I asked our server where the fish were. She simply said they were "transferred" to the MGM Grand, whatever that means. That's not much of an explanation. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

I think this place is pretty great. It's your typical -- hole in the wall, beer, pool, darts, Golden Tee, jukebox, bar food, cheap drinks, friendly people, blue collar, mostly regulars, but still friendly to newbies -- kind of place. A great place to watch a game, even better for a Nascar race (CAUTION!!!).  One thing I love is that the bartenders cook the food right in front of you at the bar. That seemed a bit odd at first, but it turns out to be a great thing because you can be more involved in the preparation of your food and see exactly what they're doing. No guessing about what's actually happening in the kitchen. Some of them are really good cooks too; you might learn something. The drinks are dirt cheap, the staff is super friendly, and the drama is always low. Just sit down, drink a beer and make a friend. Simple as that.  A quick note to the negative reviewers on this page: Your experience is not common. Every place has bad nights. Overall, this place is pretty great, especially if you're expecting a casual experience. I understand it's not for everybody, since it is a bit rough around the edges. I wouldn't bring a prom date here or anything. But if you're just looking to kick back and watch a game, it might be worth another shot.
