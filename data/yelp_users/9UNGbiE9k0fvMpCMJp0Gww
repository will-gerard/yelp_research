ALL HAIL COSTCO!!  'insert witty remark about purchasing bulk goods here'  Big fan of this place.  Love their products and I love their corporate culture.  Paying people a living wage?  Promoting from within?  Keeping your employees happy?  Every company should try and emulate costco.    I cant get out of costco without spending at least $100.  Their individually sealed frozen chicken breasts are great.  Same with the tilapia, ground beef and mahi mahi.  Always stock up on toilet paper and paper towels here.    $4 for 35 water bottles.  YES PLEASE.  They carry seasonal items like pool shock as well.  Their pool shock is literally half the price of Leslies pools across the street.  You better believe I bought 100+ lbs of it!  Protip: Get the Costco AMEX card.  Free membership to Costco and it has a pretty good rewards program.

Home depot is essential if you own a home.  I lived at this place during our renovations.  Lots of helpful employees.  They even let you bring your dog inside!    If you need to hire some extra hands there are lots of 'employees' waiting outside in the parking lot.  I wouldn't recommend hiring them.

I have wavered between 1 and 2 stars for this place.  The manager is very helpful and genuinely wants to see your pool clean.  I'll raise it a star for the solid manager.    I would give it 1 star if not for the good service.  I have owned my house and cleaned my pool for 3 years now.  It has its own share of issues, specially due to its age.  I just got a new pump put in and replaced the sand on my filter.  Everything is now in essentially brand new condition.  I have gone back and forth with them about every single issue I have had.  The last set of advice made my pool virtually unusable for a solid month this summer.    I was told to dump a bunch of crap into my pool to raise its PH.  Two weeks later I put even more chemicals in there to lower the PH, right after it was raised!  I was told every single time I went in that my chlorine levels weren't registering.  I would add more shock, more tabs and whatever product they were selling me.  It seemed to work fairly well for the first year and a half or so, then I would have to drain my pool like clockwork.  I would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing.  Then those chemicals I spent hundreds on would require me to drain my pool every couple years!!  Mind you, these chemicals are not cheap.  In fact, Leslies prices are consistently 30 - 40% higher than the competition.  I purchased a vacuum head here for $40, only to find the same exact thing at Fry's next door for $25.    In short, I was paying hundreds of dollars for chemicals that were causing more harm than good.  My CYA levels were so sky high that they don't even register on the test.   I turned to the internet to find answers to my problems.  I found http://www.troublefreepool.com/ to be a great resource.  I switched to liquid chlorine and stopped using tabs and granular shock.  After a 80% drain of my pool I am back to square one and a recovering pool.  It is quite frustrating to spend hundreds, possibly thousands, on advice that just doesn't work.  I bought my own water testing kit (Taylor Technologies K-2006) and do all my own tests.  My pool chemistry is now in balance.  Something I never had when going to Leslies.    I'm over you, Leslies.

I feel like I gotta make this a 4 star review to offset all the others.  It seems as if this Frys has fallen victim to the 'Yelp Snobs'.  I go here at least once a week.  I've never thought 'this place is dirty'.  It's not.  At all.  It was recently remodeled and the floors, shelves and produce are all clean and in working order.  Ive never been in the bathroom tho, so I cant speak for that.  It seems as if people like David W. haven't even been here.  Yes, there is a Starbucks inside this location.  There is actually a fairly nice lounge area by it too.  Free Wifi too.  Wells Fargo has a full branch at this location as well.    I would describe the clientele as 'gritty'.  Yes, every once in a while you will be asked for change in the parking lot.  I've been asked for change in many cities and many stores.  Some have been in extremely nice areas.   Never once have I held it against the business or city I am in.  What a weird reason to give less stars.  I would rather hear your experience about the goods you purchased, not a tirade about drifters in the parking lot.  Nobody cares about your minor inconvenience of saying 'no' to another human being.   I have for the most part had great service here.  I get in and out very quickly.  There are usually a lot of lines open and there are 6 self checkout stations.    Ok, now for the negatives.  We have had a few issues with some produce we purchased here.  We have purchased a couple bad onions.  I hope Frys reads this and gets a new onion supplier.  Sometimes produce items are out of stock.  This is a very busy Frys and seems to churn thru their product fairly quickly. There is a good amount of produce they do not stock.  Maui onions and crimini mushrooms come to mind.  No real seafood selection.  I go to AJs on camelback and 44th for that.

I feel like I gotta give Sky harbor a good review to offset the negatives.  It has definitely changed over the past year to include some of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  Most of my experience is in terminal 4.  Being able to choose from LGO, Chelseas Kitchen, Four Peaks, Blanco, Modern Burger, Barrio Cafe and Flos is awesome.  These choices really showcase the great local restaurants Phoenix has to offer.    I can see how some people are confused by the pickup and drop off procedures.  This is the only reason I am giving it four stars.  If you want to avoid that mess during the busy times I would highly recommend doing pickups and drop offs at the sky train.  There is literally zero traffic there and getting in and out is painless.    Free wifi is awesome and necessary.  Thanks for providing it.

We used to go to Teakwoods all the time for lunch.  However, their sub-par service is the reason why I never go there anymore.  Dont get me wrong, their grilled hot wings are some of the best I have had.    I just cant take an hour and a half for lunch.  I would not write this review if this happened once or twice.  They consistently deliver the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to.  I dont think there has ever been a time at teakwoods where I got out of there in less than an hour.  They seem to take forever for even the simplest of requests.    If you have time to waste, go check out teakwoods.  They are very good at making sure they waste as much as possible.

I am a big fan of chipotle.  Kind of embarrassed to say it but I have gotten Chipotle about once a week for the past 4 years.  I usually go pick it up during lunch at work, and this location is the one I always go to.  This location might be busy, but the workers there are AWESOME.  From the line cooks to the manager, they are all very friendly and accommodating.   The best part is how efficient they are at making your burrito.  Other chipotles' in the Phoenix area take note!  Suggestion to avoid the lines:  Get there around 12:30 instead of around noon.

I have been getting allergy shots at this location for over a year.  It has been a great experience.  Almost all of my allergies are gone!  The staff is great.  The women working the front desk are always friendly and ready to help.  The inconvenient thing about allergy shots is that you have to get them every single week.  Dr. Cohens' team makes this as painless as possible.  I never have to wait to get my shots.  The second I walk through their door I am being called to the back.  No wait at a doctors office?  I'll take it!

Not cool!  Just received a bill in the mail for this allergist.  They apparently think I owe them $200 for uncollected payments over the last 2 YEARS.  Its literally a bill that is 10 pages long with small charges from the last 15 months.  I went there for over 2 years and these payments were never once mentioned to me.  Not very happy about this at all.

When you buy the combo, you are really buying 2 meals.  Thats probably the best part about this place.  $10 for 2 meals.   My recommendations:  Jerk Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour Chicken Quesadilla with a Chile Relleno burrito.  You wont be dissapointed!

This will always be squaw peak to me.  This trail is always overcrowded.  There is a reason you can't bring pets on it.  Lots of people do this trail without even checking out the rest of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve.  There are so many awesome trails around here there is no reason to just do Squaw Peak. My suggestion: Try out the bevy of available trails all over this preserve.  We try and go hiking as much as we can and we still havent touched over 70% of them!

This place is an absolute gem.  An explanation of the food just doesnt do this place justice.  I am currently on my 10th different pasty (Just tried the Pilgrim) and I haven't been disappointed in one yet.    There is a great vegetarian menu as well.  I haven't ventured into this area of the menu yet, but all of those choices look just as delicious.    Every time I try a different pasty, it becomes my new favorite.  I'm sure you will feel the same way.  Dont pass up the $3 Irish Car Bombs!  Its so good when it hits your lips.

This place is the BEES KNEES.  Always easy to park, even on the busiest of weekends.  The dog park area is HUGE!  I believe this is one of the biggest in the valley.  They separate sides by active and passive dogs.  This can sometimes be confusing because when you actually get there its generally big dogs on one side and small dogs on the other.  I bring my little guy on both sides, but he seems to have more fun on the passive side.  Everyone here is very friendly, and as you can see by my check-ins, I have been here quite a bit.  Never once have I seen a serious situation.   The only advice I can give to people coming here:  Let the dogs work it out! Don't constantly hover over your puppy protecting it from the other ones in the park.  Let it do its thing and don't be afraid when it starts to play with the other dogs!

Breakfast buzz.  There is a reason every review mentions it.  It's that damn good.  Go there and buy a breakfast buzz.  NOW!  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the parking.  Yes, I understand there are some things you cant control.  At this point I think you are making enough money and you have a big enough brand that you can upgrade A) your location or B) buy out super burrito so you can use their parking lot.  It was understandable 3 years ago when you were just getting started, but it is now at the point where you guys need to do something about it.

How has this place not had a review yet?  It is also known as 'The Handymans Candy store' to some.  Being a new homeowner I wanted to check out this place as it came recommended by many people I know.  They have a huge selection of products that are insanely cheaper than their competitors.  I bought trim for the entire house at about half the cost of what I could get at Home Depot.  Yes, 1/2 the price.  We couldn't find a full selection of cabinets to redo our entire kitchen.  This place would be great for smaller projects like bathrooms or laundry rooms.  I wouldn't recommend it for a full kitchen remodel but you should definitely check it out regardless.  Great prices, helpful people and they are Minnesota Vikings fans.  SKOL, VIKINGS!

This place is the epitome of your neighborhood bar.  Great place to get drunk at.  I would venture to say that this was one of the highlights of this neighborhood.  I started going here long before they even had the outdoor patio.  Yeah I knew about this place before it was cool.  Suck on that, hipsters.    Their food has improved by leaps and bounds.  I can happily eat their pizza now.  The California carver is especially good.  I wouldn't say its 5 star good but its worthy of bar food.  The 5 stars is for the atmosphere.    If you ever want some sage advice on a brew, ask the resident employee Chris Shinn.  His suggestions will not disappoint.    They are packed every Tuesday for trivia.  Be wary of the cheating redditors that play upstairs.  They don't leave their parents basement that often, therefore they don't understand that looking up the answer on your cell phone is frowned upon.    All in all this is a solid place to get a brew and some food.

Take a minute to brainstorm everything you hate about Walmart.  Every generic , stereotypical thought you can come up with about this corporation.  Go ahead, I'll wait a little longer...  This Walmart embodies every single one of those stereotypes.  There is nothing good I can say about this place.  Ok, maybe one good thing: the people watching here is top notch.  Especially on a Friday night (or the 1st of the month).  I have been to this Walmart 3 times.  I refuse to ever go again.  It is seriously that bad.  This is no exaggeration.  You have been warned.

Solid wings and solid service.  Not a bad lunch spot.  Wings are always cooked fresh so its usually about a 15 minute wait for your food.

Habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as Scottsdale.  If you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price, try out Habaneros.   I am addicted to their chipotle sauce.  You can find it in almost every item there.  Try out the Shrimp or Fish tacos, they are delicious.  Sometimes the food takes a little while to cook (and there could be a line).  So be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break.  The salsa is not as spicy as I would like, but I am splitting hairs at this point.  Go try Habaneros, you wont be disappointed.  Its a nice change from every unoriginal, corporate restaurant you find in Scottsdale.

The yogurt is decent.  However, I found the place to be slightly misleading.    If you have been here, you know that this is a self serve yogurt bar.  You get your cup at the beginning and proceed to fill it with whatever frozen yogurt and whatever additional toppings you want.   At the start of the line there are two cups.  They are labeled 'Small' and 'Large'.  I picked the small cup thinking it would be cheaper.  Little did I know that at the end of the line you have to pay by the weight!  Why would you have two different size cups if you have to pay by weight at the end of it?  Needless to say when i checked out I paid a whopping $13 for two cups of frozen yogurt!  They should mention this somewhere!  Not surprise their customers at the end of the line after they have already picked everything they want!

This is THE place I tell everyone to try in Phoenix.  I am obsessed.  I think 'trendy' is the best way to describe the hotel and this restaurant.  It's pretty much the first comment from any newcomer that I bring here.    Food is fantastic and the price is right.  The shrimp tacos are the best i've had in Phoenix.  The ahi tuna tacos (When they have them) are fantastic.  The pork belly tacos (also limited selection) are good.  The guacamole is great.  The elote callejero is something you must order every time you go here.  Seriously.   The woman and I can get 2 apps, 2 beers and 6 tacos for less than $40.  Just go.  Seriously.

Don't go to the new place here.  Go to Otro Cafe or Joyride.   I know its closed now.  I had to write a review of my final meal here.  It was the worst experience I've ever had.  Sure, they were closing in 2 nights.  That does not excuse terrible service.  We waited 20 minutes for a drink.  Once we got the drinks we waited 20 minutes to order our appetizers.  Once the appetizers came out, we never saw our server again.  He purposely avoided us.  He was the guy with the ponytail.  We literally watched him move around waiting to catch his eye.  He wouldn't even look at us!  Finally we got up and asked for our check.  We wanted to stay to get tacos but obviously they didn't want the business.  We paid our bill and left to Joyride.  I won't even entertain the idea of going to the new place here.  Gallo Blanco and The Clarendon went from the top of my list to 'I'll never set foot in here again'.

I don't know what can be said about this place that hasn't already been said.  This is just great pizza in general.   My favorite part is checking out their garden by the front door.  Maybe one day my own garden will compare to theirs.   OK now back to the food.  I get the meat and cheese plate every time.  Always good.  I have only ran into one pizza I didn't like.  It's called the Manzo.  I wouldn't say it was bad, just a little too different for my tastes.  I've had 7 other  pizzas on the menu and I would order all of them again. Go check out the parlor, you wont be disappointed

I hate riding bikes on surface streets.  Drivers in Phoenix are downright hostile to people on bikes.  Very happy that I have this canal to help me ride safely to my destination(s).  From October - April I use this park at least 5x / week.  Its my running path.  It's how we get to OHSO.  Its also how we start our bike rides to Old Town Scottsdale.  A safe way to help us get to Ingo's and LGO as well.  Its so much better riding on the canal park plus the actual canals.  You get away from the cars and can enjoy your ride!

I was extremely happy with Derren's work!  He came out, gave a very competitive quote and listened to my needs.  I was getting married soon and needed the bathroom finished before the big day.  He was able to get the job done in time and did an impeccable job.    Derren did all of the work himself which I was very happy with.  You could tell he offered a quality product from the very beginning.  His suggestions along the way really helped complete our vision.  We had our master bathroom remodeled with another company before Derren.  We wanted the same exact style in both and you can definitely tell a difference in quality.  In our master bathroom we hired a general contractor.  We never met the tile guy until the day he showed up, so we had no idea what type of work he did.  I was very happy that Derren quoted the job and did all the work himself.  I would not hesitate to hire him for any of my future work.

This place is great!  As someone mentioned, its a refurbished Wendy's.  It brings an old school feel to it, they have done great work on the interior.  You can use the drive thru window to pick up to-go orders.  Awesome.  Every time I have ordered here the food has been fantastic.  I always find myself going back to the Pad Thai!   The best thai in the area and quite possibly the best thai I have had in Phoenix.  Also a locally owned restaurant, support this place!

This place was fantastic.  Went in there, ordered our carpet and got it all installed within a week.  Awesome install job, price was fair and we are very happy with the results.    Now for the reason they get 5 stars.  I was in the process of moving out of a rental home and into my newly purchased house.  I had a puppy who put a hole in the carpet at the rental home and needed to make a repair.  Went to carpet depot and told the owner my story.  He made the fantastic suggestion to use carpet out of the closet in the rental home to patch the hole and find a close match at carpet depot to replace the carpet in the closet.  This way we have a 100% match for the repaired hole.  What a great idea!  To top it off he gave us about 15 square feet of free carpet to make the repairs.  He did all this for us without even knowing that I was a previous customer.  What a great guy and a great place.  Will definitely recommend them to anyone!

Hey guys, remember the huge housing bubble in Phoenix that burst in 2007?  Remember all of the unsustainable crap that was built during that time?    If you want a case study on the type of crap that home builders could pull off during this ridiculous housing boom, look no further than Villagio.  This complex is terribad.    First off, this place has zero parking.  I mean it.  ZERO.  Maybe 4 parking spots for every 10 - 15 units.  Keep in mind these are 3 BR+ units.  For college students renting that means that 2 roommates get the garage parking spot and one hapless soul is left to find a spot on their own.  The builder knew there was going to be a shortage of parking.  There was no way this was a small oversight.  Built purely with profit in mind.  Screw the people living here, we can squeeze a few more dollars by building a couple more units!  The walls are razor thin.  If you want to buy a 200K+ apartment then you have found your mecca!  Isn't hearing your neighbors so much fun?!  Yeah sure tempe marketplace is close, but you still can't walk there. You have to own a car to live at this complex. Oh yeah, did I mention the parking issue?  The location is crap.    I feel bad for anyone who purchases here.  I wouldn't even rent here.  There are about a million better options in Tempe.  This place is a case study on how ridiculous the housing market was from 2005 - early 2008.

Yep.  This place is as good as it gets.  When I lived in Tempe, Boulders on Broadway was my friendly neighborhood bar.  Now that I have a more permanent location in the Arcadia area this is where I go.  A quick bike ride up the 48th street greenbelt and im there!   As everyone says, the back patio is awesome.  I spend the majority of my time here.  Love seeing all the different dogs and love all the local beer choices.  I am currently drinking quite a bit of dragoon IPA which they seem to always have on tap.  The prices are fair and the food is great.  I like their small bites menu for late night munchies.  A couple beers split up with a pretzel makes for a good night.    If you have friends in town and want to show them a little local flavor, check this place out.  So many local beers and they also micro-brew in house.  The back patio shows off our great weather, their menu features local ingredients such as the yucca chips.  This place is the epitome of your local bar.

I am sure you have all been through this scenario... It's lunchtime You're hungry You have no idea what you want to eat. Do you like sandwiches?  Do you like soups?  Do you like salads? Look no further than Cafe Zupas.  If you come here and can't find something that looks good then you are wayyy to picky.  Take it down a notch Mr/Mrs Picky McPickerson 5 stars.  Great lunch spot and great for a quick dinner as well.

First to review!  I had to say it.  Everyone and their mom knows about this place.  Did you know there is now a 2nd location?  This one just recently opened its doors.  I gotta say, if you haven't been able to get downtown to try this place out yet I would definitely check out this location.  We were seated immediately (on a Tuesday night).  When we left there was a line but regardless it is much less busy than the downtown location.  This location also takes reservations!  Keep that in mind for those busy Friday and Saturday nights.  Alright, lets get down to the pizza.  I had the Wiseguy.  I always have the wiseguy.  It has a delicious smoky flavor to it that you cant get anywhere else.  I have tried about 3 of the pizzas here and have not had a bad one yet.  The prices are a little high (as in $18 for a personal pizza), but whats wrong with splurging every once in a while?  That being said, I have to compare this place to some of my other favorite spots in the area.  The other two juggernauts, The Parlor and LGO, are right around the corner.  The Parlor is still my #1 pizza joint around here.  You can't beat their meat & cheese plates.  I would say LGO and Bianco are tied for #2.  LGO has a great vibe and neighborhood location.  Also its closer to my house.    You need to try all 3 places and judge for yourself.  They are now all relatively close to each other and are by far the best 3 pizza joints in Phoenix.  Its the only way to truly know!

Potbelly, you have been handed the torch.  It was a good ride Jimmy Johns, but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home.  Its not you, its me.  I promise.  I love italian-style subs.  The Wreck at Potbelly is fantastic.  The Wreck salad is also great (for a salad).    This place is my new go to sub shack.

I confess my love for Potbelly, then a Jimmy John's opens up less than a mile from my house.  Its just too damn convenient!  I get it delivered in less than 30 minutes every time.  You can't beat that.  Jimmy John's is convenient, easy and always ready to please.  (That's what she said)

I had a lot of leftover metals from some home remodeling projects.  I had been saving them for a while knowing that they are actually worth something.  Fast forward a couple weeks ago and my water heater AND washer stopped working on me.  At this point I realized I had quite a lot of stuff that I could bring into a scrap yard.  Queue Delta Metals.  Brought all my stuff down to this recycling center and they gave me a good price.  Thanks guys!

Cornish pasty was one of the first places I ever reviewed on yelp.  It started as a restaurant that seated maybe 30 people to the 3 location behemoth it is today.  I've heard they are opening a location downtown in the near future as well. I finally got a chance to check out their new location in Old Town.  As usual it did not disappoint.  The GF and I split the Royale and a side of mashed potatoes and cheese.  I washed it down with a delicious Kronenbourg.  Love that beer.  They have a great beer selection.  You can get anything from Four Peaks to a bottle of mickeys.  Who doesn't like a mickeys every once in a while? I am happy to see Cornish continue to grow.  I will continue to support it every chance I get.

There have been some great burger places opening in the Phoenix area as of late.  I would say my top 2 favorites are Aioli Burgers and Ingos tasty burgers.  Both are special in their own way.  This food truck recently took over the spot at Urban cookies that has been occupied by short leash for years.  I am a big fan of short leash and the transition to this food truck has been great.  I always get the white truffle burger because who doesn't love that flavor!  It was fantastic and went well with the ice cold mexican coke.  I will make it a habit to visit them every Tuesday at Urban Cookies.  The tradition of great food trucks continues!

After hearing every Chicago-ite I know praise this place I knew I had to try it.  I went there on opening day in North Scottsdale.  Had their italian beef sandwich.  Was meh.  Went a second time a couple weeks later.  Had the Italian beef & cheese crossaint. Meh again.  Figured I would give it one more shot at the tempe location.  Had the Chicken croissant sandwich.  Meh yet again. I know what y'all are thinking.  Why didnt you have the hot dog?  THAT'S WHAT THEY DO BEST!  A Chicago style hot dog has 2 main things which I cant stand.  Mustard and pickles.  You wont get a fair review from me when it comes to hot dogs.  I prefer the majesty of Short leash hot dogs.
