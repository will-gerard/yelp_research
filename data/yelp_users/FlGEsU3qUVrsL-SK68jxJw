Finally, after 3 years in Phoenix we find great Chinese food. I had the Peking Duck which was excellent. My wife had the spicy shrimp dish and my kids the orange chicken- all very good. Love that they start you off with hot tea. The service is super friendly and my kids had a great time. Inside is totally old school so if you are looking for new and trendy, this isn't it. Prices are super low too and you will not go away hungry. We'll be back.

We'll never use anyone else. Polite, on time, no nonsense and reasonable on price. What else is there?

Food is below average- overly breaded and extremely bland. Don't bother, there is better Chinese in Ahwatukee. Try Great Wok instead.

This is one of our favorite local restaurants. Pizza is great but don't miss the pasta dishes and lasagne. Love the Linguine with clams in the White Wine Sauce. My kids also love the big baked cookie dessert. Service is super friendly and I love to support this family owned business.

My family and I go every Sunday after Church and we love this place. In the world of chains like Ihop and The Good egg with their grumpy servers and mundane food, this place is a welcome change. Yes, the place is small and the bathroom is tiny and behind the kitchen (really, who cares, I don't come for the toilet) - biscuits and gravy are great and the servers are efficient and friendly. Never had a bad breakfast there.

I have to agree with all the reviews. I went in for a me pair of running shoes after being out of running for years. They checked out my gait and then came out with like 8 boxes of shoes. He sat down with me and helped me narrow it down to 2. I then took them outside and finally settled on a pair. These guys really take the time, take off the pressure and the prices are reasonable.

Solid four stars. Food isn't over- breaded or too sauced up. Good spice and the folks are friendly.

Went there with my family on a Saturday morning and had an excellent breakfast. Try the Santa Fe Benedict, it was great. Very clean and bright and efficient and friendly staff. Definitely be back.

I used to come here when I lived in Phoenix for the beer and wings- with a buddy from Buffalo so this place is legit. Great beer list, changes regularly- a 10% ABV Imperial Ale in a chalice? Yes please. Wings are the best in Phoenix (try Teakwoods too but get the Thai Cina) Food was great, came with a bunch of coworkers for a meeting. An all day meeting. An all day meeting around Big Data, and I'm the only non-iT nerd there. So sure, I'm a nerd to, but an Ops nerd and I consider these other self professed nerds friends but when the waitress keeps bringing you said delicious IPAs and you are enjoying the vibe- remember Big Data and Big Beers do not go well together! But seriously, nice atmosphere, clean, good choices, service and well priced. Check it out.

We used to love this place and would go for breakfast a few times a month. The servers used to be great and i loved the short rib benedict. However, the past two times were just plain bad. First they mess with the menu too much, they don't seem to be able to handle peek times anymore and they mess up the food orders. This last time we had to send the food back twice and we saw two tables get up and leave they were so irritated. We have crossed this off and will not be back.

Three words, service, service, service and this place sucks at all three. I mean horrible. Stopped by for drinks and appetizers at the bar - only three other patrons in the whole place and it still took 15 minutes for a beer and margarita. Longer on refills. And there are 4 people just standing around. The Manager, at least that's who I think he was, lose the baseball cap and sunglasses- seriously, this isn't your living room. Owners, wake up and visit your place, this is going to go under.
