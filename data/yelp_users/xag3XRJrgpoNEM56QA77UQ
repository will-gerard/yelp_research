I found a car that I wanted to purchase on cars.com and it just happened to be at Magic Auto Sales. I've never been a fan of buying cars, and considering I've purchased 5 cars in the last 10 years, I know a thing or two about car buying and the hassle that goes into it. But my experience at Magic Auto changed my opinion about used car buying. From the moment I sent in my online inquiry, my experience was great. Mina, their sales rep, got back to me quickly and answered all my questions. I was very up front about what I was willing to spend and they worked with me to meet my need. There was no haggling or negotiating. Magic Auto was the 4th dealership I had gone to to test drive a vehicle and my experience at the other dealerships almost made me give up but I'm glad I kept searching. Except for the color, which wasn't really that big of a deal for me and not something I'd expect to find unless I was buying a brand new car, I found the exact used car I was looking for. The car had some minor mechanical issues, which they were 100% up front about before we signed any paperwork, but they also said they would take care of the issues after the purchase was complete, which they did. They even asked me to drive the car for a few weeks first to see if I found any other issues that needed to be fixed beforehand so they could fix any other issues that arose. I didn't find any other issues but they fixed the initial issues as promised. About 45 days after I purchased the car, the check engine light came on so I brought it in and they fixed it no questions asked. If you're searching for a used vehicle from an honest and reputable company, I highly recommend Magic Auto Sales!

I've been taking my two dogs to PetSmart groomers for years now but this is only the second, and last, time I've used this location. In the middle of the visit I got a call that one of my dogs seemed to have a small mole above his eye that the groomer seemed worried about. I told her I had never noticed a mole by his eye and I'd check it out when I picked them up. When I finally picked him up, I saw that it wasn't a mole but a cut! I'm not sure what the heck she did, but managed to cut his eye! She swore she didn't because she never cut the hair on his head but she had to. When I got home I noticed two other cuts on his legs! I wouldn't have even gotten mad has she just been honest about it and taken responsibility but it pisses me off that she tried to say his eye was like that when I brought him in. It definitely was not! I would have noticed a big puffy swollen cut eye lid on my little 9 lb chihuahua! I'll definitely be bringing my dogs to other groomers from now on, even if I need to drive a little further. Steer clear!  UPDATE: I ended up filing a claim with the corporate office and they paid all my vet fees, which totaled a little over $700. I'm definitely not happy that my dog got hurt but I am happy PetSmart took responsibility for their mistake.

I came to this gym on a guest pass today with my friend. We were working out together going set for set (we had multiple witnesses too) and the Fitness Manager TJ came up to us and kicked us out! He said I was "training" my friend. I don't see how two friends working out together, going set for set, where one person is helping to correct the form of their friend between sets, is considered training! TJ needs to get a clue! I was going to join today and get a membership but the way I was treated means I will NEVER come back to this Golds!! TJ was beyond rude, and then when I spoke to the Club Manager, he apologized for TJ's behavior and said "That's just how TJ is." Um? If you know one of your managers is rude, maybe you should try to correct his behavior... Just a thought! I do NOT recommend this gym!!!  Now that I think about it, maybe it's because we are gay. TJ did seem like the kind of guy who might be homophobic.

So I ordered a pizza from this place a few weeks ago. It was rather late and I wasn't sure if it would let me order since it was about 10 minutes before they closed but it let me place the order online. I was excited because I was starving! I ended up getting a phone call 5 minutes later from the manager saying that I had placed the order too late and that she had to cancel the order. Dominos would have delivered it to me had I placed the original order through them, but that's beside the point. Anyway, because of the inconvenience, she offered to give me 50% off my next order as long as I called to place the order. I just tried placing the exact order but was told they couldn't honor the 50% off because my order was a special and they couldn't combine the offers. Um? That's not what the manager told me when she offered it to me. I literally placed the EXACT same order but couldn't use it. I asked what I could use it for and was told anything that wasn't a special. I told the guy I wanted the same thing as the special and asked how much it would be... It was the same price as the special. Um? What's the point in offering me 50% off if you're just going to charge me the same price as the special that ANYONE else could order. That doesn't really seem to make much sense or seem fair. I was being given 50% off because of an inconvenience you caused me. That's not my fault. You should have honored what the manager originally told me. I haven't tasted the food yet as I just placed the order so my review is based on customer service alone.

New Serenity Spa is by far the absolute BEST spa experience I've ever had. For me, this wasn't any ordinary spa day. I was looking for a romantic way to propose to my boyfriend. Since my boyfriend loves getting massages, I thought a romantic couples massage would be the way to go. I called NSS a few weeks before the day I wanted to propose just to run the idea past them and they were so excited for me! After talking to them about what I wanted, I scheduled their Romantic Couples Package for a Serenity Facial and Serenity Massage with their couples suite reserved for 30 minutes afterwards. Their Romantic Package comes with champagne, flowers, Hors d'oeuvres, and chocolate covered strawberries, which was perfect because if my boyfriend had gone online to look up the spa, he would've seen that it came with the spa package and wouldn't have suspected anything. The only downside is that my boyfriend is allergic to chocolate but the girls wanted everything to be perfect so they got us a slice of carrot cake instead of the strawberries, which was perfect because my boyfriend LOVES carrot cake. They even got us extra roses to make the day even more special! Anyway, the ladies were very accommodating to all my requests and needs. The day before the big day, I stopped by the spa to drop off a box with a custom sugar cookie that said "Will you marry me?" as well as the ring box since it was too big to hide from my boyfriend when we drove over. I kept the ring on me just to keep it safe but they helped me come up with a plan to get the ring back into the box and slip it into the robe that I was going to be wearing after the spa treatments. After the treatments, they brought in the champagne and food, and placed the box on a table between our chairs and then left the room. My boyfriend wondered what was in the box so I told him to open it to see. After he opened it and I saw the confused but happy look on his face, I pulled the ring out of my robe, got down on one knee, and asked him to marry me. He had absolutely no idea I was planning to propose and his mouth fell to the ground when I asked. With the help of the girls at NSS, they helped make our special day even more special. Thank you New Serenity Spa for making our proposal a day we'll never forget!

Best Chipotle I've ever been to! The crew members are always friendly and smiling and the food is simply amazing! I got a chicken and barbacoa bowl (gotta love extra meat) with brown rice and pinto beans, then added some corn salsa, sour cream, and guac. It was enough food to last me two meals! Love this place and will definitely return everyday!
