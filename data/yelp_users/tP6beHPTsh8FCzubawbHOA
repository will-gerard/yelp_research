Last 4 times I've come in, they've been out of most of the flavors of the pre packs. Each time they've been out of mint n chip. I've asked the employees when they expect to get it in, they responded "they don't tell us that stuff." Really disappointed in this location, as I have never had issues at any other Baskin Robins location.

I went in with a friend for lunch. As soon as we sat down, the server immediately came to greet us and asked for drink orders. Once we ordered our food, the meals got to our table extremely fast! We both got the chicken zucchini lunch plate, which was pretty good. Our server checked in on us often, and never let our drinks get more than half way empty before refilling them.   In summary, great service, decent food, I would go back.

Wow, this place has quite a few bad reviews! I've been to this location a few times and I have always been pleased with the outcome.  They provide a discount to ASU students, so that's always a plus! Also, I have a truck, but they charge me for a standard size car.  The first time I went, I was a little confused about all the packages, but the owner explained each of them to me and suggested which package was best for me based on what I told him I wanted done.  I thought this was great customer service.  My most recent visit, I purchased one of their frequent wash cards, which provides 10 washes and 2 waxes.  It is a really big savings for those who cannot stand to have a dirty car.    I have recommended this place to a couple friends, who have also had good experiences.  I'd much rather support this Mom & Pop car wash over Danny's!

The pineapple fried rice with a Thai iced tea is my go to order here.  I typically order it for carry out, but occasionally eat there.  The employees are always friendly and give good service.  There are much closer Thai restaurants by me, but it is worth the drive to go to this Thai Basil location!

Big City Burrito is downstairs of Vista Del Sol, so right across the street from ASU on Apache Blvd, close to Rural.  I've been here twice.  The first time I ordered the vegetarian burrito.  It takes a little longer than having a meat burrito, because they cook that to order.  it took only about 5 minutes.  So the wait was not long at all.  There are many types of tortillas to choose from.  There is White, Spinach, Tomato-Chili, Wheat, and more! There are also two sizes, regular (which I think is 10 in) and super (which I think is 12 in).  Then you can choose what salsas you want in your burrito, black or pinto beans, rice, and guacamole and sour cream for an additional cost.    The first time I had the vegetarian burrito, as I mentioned before.  It was very good.  I came around 9pm. (They are open really late). The food was very good and the service was great.  The girl who works there is a vegetarian, so she recommended me to try the potato burrito next time.  When I went in there today, it was a complete different staff.  The service was still good, just not as great as the first time.  I ended up ordering the potato burrito on the Tomato-Chile Tortilla, which was great.  I will definitely be coming back to this place.   PROS: Good food Quick Good Service Reasonable Prices  CONS: If you do not go to ASU, hard to find parking.

I don't have a single complaint about this coffee shop! The cold brew coffee is fantastic, the employees are amazing, and the location is in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale!  I grab a cold brew coffee almost every day before work, which is reasonably priced.  I do, occasionally, have to park down the street, but the it is definitely worth the walk!  I have bought beans from them to brew on the weekends, which is almost just as good as when they make it.
