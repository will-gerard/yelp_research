Pho is my favorite and this place does it well! The spring rolls are amazing! I love that you get the Carrot infused fish sauce to dip the hot crunchy rolls in! Amazing! And getting a vat of soup is nothing to complain about either! I always get the #1 and the #12. The #12 is the Fresh Slices Beef Pho, through some jalapenos and lime juice in there and eat up! Mm Mm Mmmm!!

Amazing atmosphere! Michelle behind the bar is a DOLL! She made our experience!  The band was a little loud, but what can you expect on a friday night.  Amazing cheese and charcuterie selection.  We will definitely be back!

Great food. I love how they are expanding their menu to become more vertical in the different Asian cuisines.  Great service as well!

I have been coming into spokes for a while now. I have looked passed them fudging up orders, having hazardous plastic material in my food, and not having patrons/frequent patrons served in a timely manor. I don't care if I come in at 10 am or 1:30 am I should get the same service! And for the most part that happens. But when I come in on Tuesday night and the karaoke host's friends are there.... You better believe they will get what they want before the rest of the bar, whether it be drinks or songs. I am very upset with the establishment and the karaoke company they employ. This is not the first time that I have come to spokes and been denied a song.  Although we spend a lot of money at spokes, I don't believe I will be in to 'say hi' for a while.  And if I could find the karaoke company's yelp page I would have a lot more to post. But I'll leave it at that.

Let me start off with; I was a karaoke host a couple times in my life, also I know how to respectfully speak to other human beings.  This was the second time I have encountered this karaoke host. And the first time should have been my red flag.  If a guest wants to ask you simple questions and you are either too rude, too drunk, or too incompetent to reply with an answers that satisfies the question then you should not be in the HOSPITALITY industry.  When I asked about certain songs and their versions he did not want to answer me and responded with a couple F-bombs. This makes me think that he has illegal copies of songs. I hope the owner of this bar understands he is losing good money by the people he employs.  Do not go on nights that Dan Dan the Karaoke host is there. I can't speak for any other nights.
