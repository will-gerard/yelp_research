After biting into my pork sandwich I was greeted by a gnarly hunk of BONE; I let the my waitress know. her response was not sympathetic and she shrugged it off by letting me know that it happens frequently and in a variety of their meats. Their guacamole was great, but the rest of the food was lackluster and missed the target.

This ain't no Krispy Kreme!!! It's next to impossible to find this artisan style of doughnut in AZ, and I'm glad that Born and Glazed brought some diversity to the Valley! Each time I go to this little hidden gem, I try a new morsel and they are just so dang decadent it's hard not to go home with a dozen or more. It doesn't get much better than treating yourself to a sweet, cakey, truly original style doughnut  and sipping on some smooth espresso to start off your day. This spot has definitely blown up since they first opened so believe me when I say THEY SELL OUT!!! So get there early so you can try these delectable delights before they all run out!
