I enjoyed my stay at the hotel.  I got a room on the inside courtyard near the pool and the spa.  It's a nice place privately owned by someone who cares about the property since it's kept in great condition (from the grounds, to the parking and the rooms).  almost all the staff was nice but found the nighttime front desk people a bit rude but the daytime people and valets are super nice!  Helpful, courteous and went out of their way to answer questions.  I recommend staying here since they have a steak place across the lot that is part of the complex as well as other restaurants at the mall on the other side of the street.

My friend and I got our nails done while I was in Vegas for the 4th.  My person was Sureena and she was so nice and did a GREAT job with my mani/pedi and suggestions with nail polish.  She even made my feet look very pretty with all the buffing and polishing (don't ask about my feet!).  Let's just say my feet looked GOOD!

Very disappointed with the claim jumper.  The food wasn't hot, the service was .. blech and it was just disappointing for the amount of money spent.  I would never go to this location again.

Very good food (my friend got sushi w/soup and I got pizza with a salad) and the service was very good.  Nice staff, good looking restaurant and friendly people.

Really cute place and the food was delicious.  LOVED the sweet and sour soup (unlike any version I've ever had before).  It was yummy spicy, with pasta, veggies and a great light broth!  I loved the shared tapas plates and enjoyed everything we had a tofu red curry (spicy and yummy), rice and beef bbq.  What a great spot and recommend if your in town that you grab dinner!!!

Coffee smells great and tasted even better!!! LOVED the challah bread french toast.  My friend and I shared the apple with brandy and it was simply the best EVER!!!!  It's HUGE and so tasty with coffee that it made our day!  The bacon was cooked perfectly (crispy, not greasy, smoky, hickory, sweet/tangy) and liked the eggs too.    Great place for breakfast!!!!  They also have a firepit with great seating outside.  Too bad it was a bit chilly but we enjoyed eating inside and looking out the windows.  Lots of natural light and friendly staff.

I thought the staff was super nice, friendly and attentive.  I really enjoyed the chips and the three salsas that come to the table when you sit down from mild to hot.    I was not impressed with the food.  I ordered steak fajitas and my friend a burrito. We were both not very happy with the food.  I think they used steakums for the fajitas and my friend just said her burritos were ehhh.

Great salsa very spicy and different from the norm since it's traditional mexican food.  It's very tasty and a cute intimate little restaurant in a small shopping mall.    Has a great little bar as well as an area great for meeting up with friends and a 2nd floor loft area with additional seating.
