So I was walking out of REI after picking up some last minute supplies for a backpacking trip, and was about to get in my car when I remembered I hadn't eaten all day.  So I popped in looking for some quick grub.  There were a couple of people ahead of me in line so I expected some sort of wait for my food, but it took over 10 minutes after ordering for my order to be ready.  This isn't a nice sit-down restaurant, but more of a "fast food" type, order-at-the-counter joint.  For a bean burrito and a couple of cheese enchiladas it should not have taken that long.  And it was definitely not worth the $9.  The bean burrito was okay if that.  The beans had no flavor (compared to other Mexican food places of the same style.)  The red enchilada sauce had a good flavor and definitely tasted homemade, but the cheese enchiladas were enchiladas minus the cheese.  Seriously.  All I was given were corn tortillas rolled up with a completely hollow and filling-less center.  WTF.  Definitely won't eat here again.

Was brought here by a couple of friends who kept raving about the food.  My first and last time.  I begged them to try another place to compare.    The meat resembled rolled up frozen deli meat of poor quality.  Nothing fresh, very tasteless and dry.  The selection of veggies looked sad and very picked-over.  I was disappointed that there was not an option of adding an egg.  And the starch choice was noodles or plain rice, that's all.  Lots of choices of sauces but they still couldn't make it delicious.  But wait...  free frozen yogurt!  I could care less.  I eat at Mongolian grills for the Mongolian, not crappy generic soft serve.  And then to be charged for a to-go box?  That's ridiculous.  I will go to Genghis Grill instead.  Quality trumps quantity any day (not to mention actual service.)  Even the Mongolian Grill at the Banner Desert hospital cafeteria is better as far as taste and quality goes (not to mention WAY cheaper.)

Don't eat here unless you want to become violently ill.  My boyfriend made the mistake of eating the salsa that was sitting out on the table.  Now I have the joy of taking care of him because he has a really bad case of food poisoning as a result.  Great way to ruin a vacation.

Great Mexican food, delivered.  I'm in heaven.  I get it at home, and at work.  I always order combination number 2.  The refried beans are some of the best I've had.  My only complaint is that it usually takes at least an hour for delivery because they're always so busy.  And I wish they were open 24/7, instead of closing at 9pm.  But still, a great alternative to Chinese or pizza.

Came here for Arizona Restaurant week, and it was my first ever visit.  For an appetizer I ordered the burratta, which included proscuitto and had a wonderful mango? vinaigrette dressing drizzled over it.  Fabulous!!  Then came the mushroom pan fry.  OMG.  A party in my mouth and I've been craving it ever since.  Perfect flavoring.  The dessert was banana bread pudding, and while I'm a huge fan of bread pudding, this one disappointed.  Too dry for my liking.  They also had a wine flight special and the wines were very enjoyable.  Their wine list is ridiculous.  It's literally a book.  A little too overwhelming for me.  My companions ordered off the regular menu.  One friend ordered soup and salad and asked that the soup be brought with the entrees.  But it was served with the salad.  She again asked that it be brought out later so they took it away.  When it was brought out later it was cold and hardened potato soup.  My other friend's dish was also cold.  Both were reheated and the manager offered each of them a complimentary glass of wine which was really appreciated.  On the pricey side, so will probably come back when someone else is paying or I find a special deal.  But I'll definitely be back.

My favorite place whether for dinner or just beers.  This is where I take out-of-town visitors because it's always guaranteed to please.  The food is absolutely amazing.  Everything they serve is fantastic from burgers to pizza to dinner specials.  The spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had, and all of their beer bread sandwiches are delish.  They make excellent beers too, way better than other local breweries.  Never had bad service here.  Parking can be an issue but I have always managed to find a space in the back.

I'm so glad I found this studio.  I feel like it's my new home.  I always feel welcome here, like I'm part of a family.  I have loved every instructor here.  Each has their own style but I still feel pushed in a positive way and I've really progressed here.  They are super friendly and always greet me by name, even after having only met me once.  And the same goes for the other students.  Friendly, non-competitive, encouraging and helpful.  The studio is large and there is always plenty of room.  I like how I can choose the extremeness of the heat as one side of the room is hotter than the other.  Don't get me wrong.  It's hot.  Just that one side has the humidifiers on it and it can be REALLY hot near them.  The room has good air circulation and it doesn't get too stuffy and I feel like I can breathe.  Bikram yoga is the only exercise I've found that I can really stick with.  Even with working 12-hour shifts I can find the time.  I don't feel right unless I go.  It gives me a clearer mind, clearer skin and clearer sight.  I have more energy and I only feel like eating healthy foods.  I sleep better and have less back pain.  I only wish I had started a long time ago, but as Bikram says, "You're never too old, never too bad, never too late and never too sick to start from the scratch once again."

Love, love, love this place.  Everything I've had on the menu is amazing.  Pure genius.  I especially love their salads, the Big Beefstro and the Pablo Picasso.  Too bad they got rid of my favorite salad which was the spinach salad.  The pizza and pastas are also excellent.  Never had a bad food experience or heard any complaints from others.  The service is great, although we usually just order take-out for home or work.  It can get very busy (expect a wait, especially on weekends) and parking can be limited as the parking lot is shared with multiple asian food restaurants.

I purchased a Groupon despite really bad experiences with other cleaning companies via Groupon but it was definitely worth the gamble.  After a few emails a date and time range was agreed upon.  The cleaners arrived within the expected time frame.  They were very friendly and courteous.  They got to work right away and worked diligently.  They finished just short of the two hours and I was very impressed with the work that was done.  I'd never had my house professionally cleaned but they went above and beyond what I expected for basic cleaning.  They cleaned the baseboards, made sure to move the fridge and clean behind it, dusted the ceiling fan blades, etc.  I couldn't find anything that hadn't been cleaned or wasn't cleaned to my liking.  I highly recommend them.

I seriously don't understand what people think is so great about this place.  Maybe because it's been around forever and they're the kind of people that won't ever branch out and try something new.  This place was okay back in the day but has suffered a serious decline.  PEOPLE!  We live close to the border.  There are plenty of excellent, authentic Mexican restaurants in the valley.  Macayos is to Mexican as Olive Garden is to Italian: a bland, Americanized, chain restaurant version of international food.  The food is nothing special.  When asked what ingredients were in the salsa a waiter responded, "I don't know, the salsa comes from a can."  I can never say that I've had great service here.  One waitress in the bar broke my friend's older "Senor Bob" margarita glass, didn't apologize and just gave him a new one.  When he pointed out that the new ones are much smaller her response was, "You get the same amount of tequila in both."  Which is not true and leads to another point.  The margaritas here have become downright horrible.  I watched the bartender fill margarita glasses with a pre-made pitcher of watered down sweet and sour mix lightly spiked with cheap tequila.  It's sad that I can't even force myself to come here, given that it's walking distance from my house and they have a nice patio on the lake.  But after many worsening experiences I have given up on this place and won't return.

I'm a late-night person, and I love that this place is open until 2am everynight.  It's nice to not have to worry about rushing to get somewhere before they close.  Not to mention that fact that I'm cheap and will only go to sushi bars when it's happy hour and they have reverse happy hour.  The prices are just right, sushi is fresh and delicious.  The service is okay.  I've only been here on weeknights when the place is pretty much empty but service was still slow although friendly.  I like the modern decor but it's not the most comfortable seating.  There are plenty of televisions at the bar for sports fans.  I just like having somewhere close to my house where i can get sushi late at night that isn't too loud, over-crowded or expensive.

Original plan was to come in for reverse happy hour but we ended up there at 9pm. So glad, because they have half price sushi on weekdays from 6-10. We ordered 3 rolls from the half price selection and were totally wowed. We both agreed it was the best sushi either of us have ever had. Very fresh and excellent sauce. Service was top notch, very attentive. Our food came very quickly even though they place was so full that we had to sit at the bar. Can't wait to go back for more!

Normally I avoid Tempe Marketplace at all costs, especially on a Saturday night, but a friend insisted on going because he said it was really good food in large portions.  Apparently not so anymore.  Four of us split the Lucille's Appetizer Platter which is basically a sampling of all of the appetizers.  This was good, but then again it's hard to go wrong with fried food.  It's the meat that they really screwed up on.  I ordered the tri tip sandwich, which I describe as slices of beef jerky on a dried out potato bun with a little BBQ sauce.  Funny thing is, beef jerky is exactly how a friend described his steak, which he ordered to be cooked medium and it came out well done.  The only meat that anyone ordered that was moist and tasty was the chicken.  The service wasn't the best.  We were promised biscuits but we had to remind one of the four different servers we had that they still hadn't come out more than halfway into our meal.  Maybe it was just a bad night for dry, overcooked meat, but given the location, prices and lack of stellar service, I definitely won't be returning.

They seriously need to hire some maids who know they meaning of punctuality, or they will be out of business soon.  I purchased a Livingsocial deal and they couldn't schedule me until after the deal expired but said they would honor it.  I made an 11:30 appt but no one showed up or called.  I called the office and was told they were running an hour and a half late!  Since I had plans for later in the day I had to reschedule and was given a 9am appointment so tardiness would not be an issue.  But apparently these maids can't even show up on time for their first appointment of the day.  In fact, they can't even show up at all.  I called the office and the guy I spoke with said he wasn't aware they didn't show and would call me back when he found out what was going on.  He never called back and wouldn't answer the phone or return my voicemail message.  Worst customer service I have ever experienced.

Horrible service, mediocre food and overpriced.  Definitely won't be going back.  Called in an order to go and picked it up from the drive-thru.  Got home and opened up our packages to a huge disappointment.  I ordered the South of the Border omelette and couldn't believe that the fruit and sour cream were both thrown on top of the omelette.  The fruit should have been packaged separately (hot and cold don't belong together) and the sour cream should have been in a cup by itself.  The pepper jack cheese in the omelette was of the processed variety (think Velveeta.)  I would think that a place that tries to be higher end would use quality ingredients.  The second order was fried chicken and waffles but that's all we got.  No butter, no syrup.  So instead of eating our meals we had to make a trip to the grocery store to buy syrup since the restaurant was too far away.  When I called the restaurant to point this out I was told (after a very long and awkward pause) that the chicken and waffles would be taken off the bill.

I went here because I had a Groupon.  I've been to several other places for botox before and never had any problems.  Until I came here.  Didn't have to wait long before being taken back to the room by the nurse.  While she was getting everything prepared she commented on how she had just eaten lunch and was tired.  Not what I wanted to hear from someone about to inject my forehead.  Then her cell phone rang and instead of silencing it she picked it up and made her vacation plans while drawing up the botox.  I had to wait until her call was completed, then she began to aggressive stab and inject the botox into six sites on my forehead.  I was appalled at the manner in which it was done.  I'm an RN, and I've had this done many times before, and this is NOT how you inject.  She then took her thumbs and firmly rubbed the spots she had injected as if she were spreading it around.  This is WRONG!!!  Now I'm left with a huge bruise on my forehead.  I'm lucky that it's the worst thing that happened from this visit.  I would never go back, no matter how cheap or how good of a deal it is.

5 stars all the way!  Excellent food at a great price.  The hot dogs with the homemade buns are high quality and the best I've ever had.  The tacos are huge and filling.  The lemonades are made fresh to order and are very refreshing. The service has always been outstanding.  The employees are sincerely friendly and go out of their way for you.  So glad to have this gem in my neighborhood.  Everyone I bring here becomes a fan.

I had never been overly impressed with the service or quality of the work done here, but my last visit has made me afraid to return.  I purchased a voucher for three car washes, and I have one left but I'll probably just give it away.  I took my older hatchback car in for the first wash and it was cleaned, but nothing outstanding.  For the second wash I took in my brand new SUV.  As soon as I arrived I was approached by a guy offering to fix the chips in my windshield.  Um, there aren't any.  I find these "sharks" really annoying and don't want to be bothered by them.  When they were finished "cleaning" I went to get in and immediately saw that they didn't bother to clean the cup holder in the center console or the inside of the drivers door, but was shocked to find the speaker on the passengers door hanging down!  I pointed it out to the girl and she motioned for the manager who brushed it off as something that happens all the time and popped it back into place.  He didn't even apologize.  Sorry, but that is not something that "just happens" on a new vehicle.  When I got home I discovered water spots all over the exterior and I had to wipe it down myself, as well as clean the interior.  They never bothered to open the hatchback and vacuum the back either.  I definitely won't be back, even though it's the closest car wash to my house.  It's just not worth having my vehicle damaged.

I was in desperate need for a Brazilian wax, and this was the closest place to my house and they could get me right in.  I was skeptical when I was lead into a tiny back room with a curtain on the windowed door.  It didn't scream "clean and aseptic"  and definitely not worthy of a $45 wax.  But Mimi was very friendly and put me at ease.  And wow, she was thorough.  She made sure that she didn't miss anything.  I did have to knock a star off because the second time I visited she went to work without asking me what exactly I wanted and well, yeah, I wasn't too happy about that.  As far as manicures and pedicures go, I haven't had either done, just reviewing on the waxing service.

First time I ordered from them was for delivery through Grub Hub.  I ordered several appetizers, pizza and salads.  They forgot half my order and had to re-deliver.  For my inconvenience I was given a coupon for a free pizza.  This time I ordered a pizza, salad and chicken strips for pick-up.  And yet again, they screwed up and gave me the wrong pizza.  When I informed them of this I didn't even get an apology, only an excuse that they were really busy and my pizza went out on someone's delivery.  They didn't even offer to fix the problem until I showed up with the wrong pizza and requested the right pizza, to which I was rudely told, "Well, you're gonna have to wait."  Which is what I'm doing right now, although the kitchen staff seems too busy with their phones.  Unbelievable.  Never again.  And I asked for no peppers on my salad.  Looks like they just took a pre-made salad and picked off the peppers by hand as there were still a couple left in the salad.

I have to appreciate the fact that they deliver, but OMG it is not worth their prices.  The entrees (even soup and salad!!!) cost $8.95+ and the appetizers are $5.95+ while the portions are mediocre at best.  I can order delivery from any Asian outfit and get twice the food for half the cost.  The quality and taste of the food here is just average.  Fool me once, shame on you..  fool me twice.. haha... ain't gonna happen.  It's just sad that a really good, authentic Thai restaurant in this location was replaced by a money-hungry chain.

Had eyelash extensions with Brie.  Couldn't be happier.  She took her time and was meticulous.  Really paid attention to detail.  Not to mention very friendly and easy to talk to.  The lashes are soft and natural looking.  It looks like I was born with fabulous lashes and they don't scream fake.  Four weeks later and they're still going strong and look great.  Looking forward to my next visit.  Won't go anywhere else.

Love that they have Four Peaks beer on tap, including my favorite, Hop Knot. But I'm wishing I had made a different food choice. l ordered the grilled cheese with creamy tomato soup. Because I figured it was impossible to go wrong with a comfort food staple and I'm tired of burgers at the airport. I must have had a shocked look when my food arrived. The tomato soup was no where near creamy, but a chunky-ish tomato soup with no cream. The grilled cheese was no where near the gourmet sandwich the menu promised. So not worth $10. Should have gone to NYPD pizza instead.

Had my very first experience with eyelash extensions here in December 2013.  Had a pleasant experience with them being placed, and they looked great but within 2 weeks every single lash had fallen off.  Not that my lashes fell out, but the glue did not hold at all.  I was extremely diligent about following the instructions.  Now after having gone to two other places for eyelash extensions and not having an issue at either one (couldn't get the lashes off if I tried) I know that it's not me, it's the inferior glue that they use.

Total scam. I arrived at 11pm totally exhausted after having been awake over 36 hours. I had made a reservation online and prepaid. Jose asked me if I wanted any extra coverage and I told him no, I have auto insurance in the state of Arizona. He provided me with a paper, said initial here, sign here. I hastily did as he said wanting to get out of there as quickly as possible, trusting that the agreement was as it was supposed to be. I never had any issues the numerous times I've rented from them before. Now looking at the agreement, I was charged for everything under the sun making my $119 rental now a $282 rental. Do not trust this company. Do not sign without carefully reading. They will lie and try to scam you. And the car? Old car with over 42,000 miles in poor condition. The girl who handed me the keys just pointed down an aisle and told me to go find it, no checking for damage or making sure everything was okay. Will never use them again. It would have been cheaper to use another company.

I've been here a couple of times now and plan on making regular visits. I've had the boil with shrimp both times (trifecta, level 2) and it's amazingly good and want to explore the menu some more. Service was above and beyond on both visits. The best part is they serve Arizona beers on tap, especially from Grand Canyon, my favorite.

I really wanted this to be my go-to place, given it's location near my house and their great prices, but unfortunately it wasn't the right fit for me.  I was able to get an appointment quickly (within a few days.)  Everyone in the studio was extremely friendly and the process was painless.  The lashes lasted forever but they just weren't for me.  I asked for a more natural "mascara" look but the lashes were still too over the top.  They were more than twice the length of my natural lashes and did not look natural at all.  They were made of a stiff plastic material that was uncomfortable and looked more like false eyelashes than eyelash extensions.

I'm not new to eyelash extensions. I've been getting them for years. I've had good ones and bad ones. I will avoid this place. Cheaper? Maybe. But not when you consider you're only getting half the lashes other artists will give you. In 15 minutes she will slap a few lashes on haphazardly then cast you off to dry while another client takes your place on the table. Sorry, but I'd rather pay just a little more for twice the lashes that look twice as good and last twice as long. And a little customer service goes a long ways. The client on the table next to me had a sick child coughing just 2 feet away from me. No thanks. You get what you pay for.
