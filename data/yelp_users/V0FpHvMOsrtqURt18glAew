Dr Stewart is a fantastic Dr that has taken great care of me over the years! I always haves a wait on my appointments, but I do not mind due to the level of service provided by him and the staff! Stevie and the rest if the staff go above and beyond!

Anytime he utters the words WAFFLE HOUSE I am in... Sunday morning breakfast... Friday night bite...I freakin' LOVE Waffle House! I always get the hashbrowns smothered (onions) covered (cheese) and topped (chili)  Granted its a total dive, older place but who cares... we all love it, kids are always happy and so is momma! We always get great service and our coffee stays full and hot and the ice tea is great!

Yet again they let us down and now we remember why... We knew we had not been back in awhile. While we love the cerviche, (we get the one with the abalone/oysters/octopus/shrimp/clams) YUM! ut all we like... The rice is yuck with corn and carrots in it, beans are not much better, chips,, blah... nothing special... but after ordering a margarita special... Serious??? Thats a margarita?? Pretty watered down and flavorless...(it was not the .99 cent special ) When I spoke to the waitress she could have cared less... We shared THE ONE sppon that came with our cerviche for over 5 minutes till we were able to wave down someone for anotehr spoon... Sorry to put the waitstaff out.. next time I simply will not bother coming...

Quickly and accurate service, this location was generous with the ketchup & taco sauce :-) I hate getting 2 ketchups with a fry order, having to practically beg for more!

My first Pho! I never understood why you see the food network people get all excited as they describe the pho they are eating and the layers of flavor... now I GET IT! AWESOME! I love pho! The spring rolls are spectacular too! The servers are very helpful when you are ordering, taking the time to explain everything!

We were extremely happy with our meals and the cost... considering that it was on the strip, the price was fantastic! Great happy hour special! (Discovered a 20% off with a fourstar check into the mall) Guacamole was great, fajitas had great flavor.. just enough heat for me, but my man was able to enjoy dinner without calling them wimpy. (Shrimp was a little overcooked) Hector the manager was fantastic as well as Aracely our server!

Stopped by on a Saturday to grab a bunch of storage boxes for the office year end... they had 2 10 packs left.... after asking if they happen to offer a rain check on the great sale price, I was quickly offered a substitute, better brand at the same cost! Kudos! I got what I needed with NO trip back! :o)

I found this place simply by checking to see what's "good in the hood" on foursquare. I am Gluten Free however, my man will go weak at the knees for a good Po'Boy... deciding to make his day I stopped in to get him one and upon walking in I see on the menu board the GF options. (Do you hear the angels singing???) The gal in the front was quick to offer a sample or two and they were delish! My order quickly expanded.   Now keep in mind, I DROVE the food back to Surprise, it was fabulous! I have not had GF food that enjoyable in some time! I absolutely LOVED it! He was thrilled to find there is a decent place to get some of his beloved southern favorites, he thought it was a great Po-Boy and the Gumbo was terrific... The GF fried green tomatoes with the sauce were wonderful and I absolutely enjoyed my GF catfish with the fantastic sauce! I have to say a smile spread clear across my face when the gal announced "Your order is ready Miss April!" I LOVE the South! Thank you for bringing that to the Westside! We will be back!

Rosies... when you walk in you can tell that she has been in business for years by the décor. It shows of her love for the City she is from and she has her business in. I really enjoyed the Chef salad which was absolutely huge! The staff is a very friendly bunch of people and the service was great, our drinks were kept full the entire meal. I am told the homemade lasagna was GREAT!  I was not able to eat it, but my fiancée absolutely LOVED it. The sausage to die for, and I can make a meal out of that alone. As I have shared in other reviews... I am gluten free, but the rest of the party enjoyed the buttered garlic rolls that kept coming out. We will go back, again and again.

I have went into Bashas 3X in the past week to find out about a promotion for a local event that they sponsor, was in their add, and they are to have a display in which to enter for free tickets/ and you can purchase (?) for free tickets... NO ONE can tell me what the hell I need to purchase... I got one manager, was told to come back the next day to talk to the next manager (it was ONLY the 1st day of the ad and they did not have the info yet...) Understood, today trip 3, (the NEW ad came out yesterday... still NO ONE can tell me a thing! REALLY??? Buy Miller beer he tells me... ok, 6pk, 12 pk??? He does not know... Go figure!?! I could have bought the stupid tickets for what I spent driving down there trying to find out what you should have been able to find out on day 2...

We were forced to change dentist which was not an easy thing for my 3 kids considering the last one was their uncle! Alas we now have dental insurance :o) I chose our new dentist and made an appointment for the kids, they were able to get us in very quickly! So quickly that my insurance was not yet processed, upon a call to the insurance company they were able to get the info and we went assured it was covered! All paperwork was done quick and easy online prior to walking in. As I stated the kids are not happy walking in the door... the girls (&^*$*!!) the entire way... My youngest is a special needs kiddo (I fight in constantly in hygiene issues) that is very literal and takes everything said straight to the heart. As the Dentist explained "sugar bugs" to my youngest he sat interested and listening... when he got to the part about them "pooping" on your teeth and how important it is to keep that "poop" brushed off I visibly saw my son flinch and shudder! Needless to say when I told him last night and this morning to brush his teeth, he went RIGHT in and brushed! AWESOME!!!  (One of the girls is rather sensitive and stated her gums hurt, but I won't mark off a star for that since he got to deal with her attitude  : o)   KUDOS Canyon Modern Dentistry!

The only thing worse than the fact that you have to get blood drawn is the wait... even if you schedule an appointment!  I am quite sure that the fasting does NOTHING to improve upon my mood, so I will bump them up a star! I did have some issues with my orders... they quickly got my Dr's office on the phone and cleared the problem getting me on with my day!

We have twice been to the Sunday Brunch now.. at $20 a person it is a bit more pricey than the regular buffet that we would enjoy... That being said... the crab was better by far, sweet & firm snow crab that was nice in color! The atmosphere is defiantly better and the fact that they throw in mimosas... what a great way to spend a Sunday morning with my man! The ceviche (add catsup)  was wonderful both times, served with their homemade fresh tostado shells... also enjoyed was the bagels with smoked salmon, cream cheese, red onion, egg and missing were the capers.. Also in the bar was nice sized two bite shrimp that were worth the time to peel, although they did run out of cocktail sauce for the shrimp  (What buffet runs out of cocktail sauce, but I guarantee IF there is one in the Valley that is out, I WILL pick that day to visit!) The second time they had the cocktail sauce and it was homemade and great, with fresh horseradish.  I have to admit we completely bypassed the breakfast array and the prime rib/roast butt combo being passed off. However, I am gluten free and he both times we went in for the seafood and ate several lbs. of it. That being said, do realize there is a full made to order omelet and Belgian waffles Bar. Dessert - Ugh... we totally bypassed it... I could picture all the little cheesecakes/cakes lined up in their Costco or Smart & Final packaging. I tried to order a flan, but this "Fresh Modern American Grill" did not offer any on the menu. All in all, we will go back to enjoy the seafood offerings and will watch for another coupon deal, (I found a Groupon and also a mailed out flyer)

Updating again! I do have to clarify this is for the Sunday Buffet Brunch! I have not visited eating off the regular menu.  We just really love this place and the last visit was fantastic! Sierra was our server and she was a treasure! The food was great and I could see that there had been a few changes made... items were stocked.. people were moving like they actually worked there! The spread is pretty similar everytime we have been there, BUT... last time I discovered something new... (could have been there prior but being gluten free I tend to not pay attention to the desserts) It looked so good and I wondered... YES Sierra assured me, a FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE! :o) Endless crab & flourless chocolate cake... life is complete!

Loved it! We went for a special night out and it was wonderful. We had a fabulous waitress. The food was fantastic, (We got the 3 meat platter, burnt ends rock!) Thoroughly enjoyed the night. A month later we took the kids for two birthdays.. costly night, but the kids loved it! We were able to get right by the shark tank which thoroughly entertained the kids (all 6 of them 9-17 years old) Food went over well with everyone, but... get there early before they run out of burn ends :o( We learned the hard way. My only gripe, they never have any coupon or specials or we would visit more often! Funny enough both trips were FOR Dillons, we never even went to the zoo! We will be back :o)

Home of the 2 hr wait! They actually have installed a shade/misters overhead since the wait has gotten worse over the years...  I hate coming down here! Heads up - If you are taking a teen for the driving test, this is the home of the 3 point turn! Avondale has the parallel parking,,, Choose your preference! (The waits tend to be about half at the Avondale location.)

Updating my review and dropping it to 2 stars (from 3)... I bought the shirt, not the tiny unrealistic women's shirt but a men's 2xl.... washed it one time and now the side twists around more to the middle and its too small to wear comfortably :-( I always buy big to allow for shrinkage, .. and then my man can wear it too... that theory didn't work!   Another review also madee think think of something... She didn't understand the token concept, but thinking about it... genius! If everyone left with 1 or 2 tokens (or 3 like we did)??? Just imagine the extra profit from that!?!

We were at the Street Eats 2014 and found ourselves at the BuzznBeez Food Truck twice! The first time we were undecided between the grilled shrimp or fish taco's. Bee encouraged us to go for the fish! We got 2 mild one hot which we were surprised they were willing to do that! Tacos came out 2 spicy, one mild... :o( Alright, someone in our party got ripped... but we can deal with that. We were able to make another guys day,  He was peeking at the tacos and mentioned that he loved spicy and we treated him to a taco off our as of yet untouched plate! :o) We walked around trying a little of this, that and the other with the kids and I kept going on about the tacos... Which found us back in front of BEE! They are now out of shrimp, but we again got 3 grilled fish, all mild tacos and a side of fries... and I was a happy momma! (Till I tried the fried...) Bee... you managed to have not only our favorite, but least favorite item... Granted the fried were only a buck, but why even serve them??? They were warm limp fries that were not even seasoned! The kids would not even eat them. I am still giving 4 stars, thinking positive that you were trying to accommodate something for all budgets! :o) Ok, those grilled fish tacos were da BOMB! The coleslaw was great, not too much! I had several items yesterday that were coleslaw with a side of ____ . But the ratio on your taco's were great! What the heck is in that sauce??? I could just drink it! Seriously consider bottling that sauce! I look forward to finding your truck again!

Went in for a business luncheon... We were quickly seated and given menus. The waitress came by very shortly and took drink orders and asked if we were ready to order or she could come back. She was very through and went thru all the explaining on how they season the steaks, and explained how to order so that we would be happy with the end result! She also inquired if we were on a "lunch hour"  Loaves of bread were sent out quickly and they smelled heavenly! (I am gluten free, so was not able to enjoy,, but the 4 people I was with inhaled 4 loaves in front of me with out a complaint!) Lunch was quickly served and everyone enjoyed the food ordered. I had the under 500 cal - Flat iron steak, green beans & salad (waitress reminded me of the croutons which were left off :o) I thought it was a great lunch and I am happy to see another nice option in Surprise! The desserts looked incredible!

I really hope to see these guys make it.. I went by one day too early and one of the guys came out to say hello and let me know when they would open that day. We finally made it down there last night to give them a try... kinda weird to walk into a BBQ place and not smell the BBQ! There were a few families in there, everyone was waiting for food. We gave our order to the 12 or 13 year old behind the counter and she placed it to her side and we sat down to watch her spend the next 10 minutes continuing to take orders... (Our slip was still on the counter..) Finally the entire stack of slips was sent to the back, we joked with the table next to us that we were probably on the bottom... After quite a wait the last family that walked in got their order and left... then the couple that came in behind us got their order as we sat and waited... by now we had gotten to know them a little and they were from Kansas City...  In their words the BBQ was ok... he felt that the meat should pull from the bone, which it defiantly did not do. They completed their meal and offered us some untouched ribs while we were STILL waiting for our food! We declined and finally the food comes out. Hubby takes the cornbread and immediately pushes it to the side of the table.. he refused to try it even, "Its cake, not bread!" The ribs were ok... we pretty much thought the same, that it should pull from the bone more. The coleslaw was nothing spectacular and the rice/beans were pretty much left untouched. Not a place that we would go out of our way to go to by any means... :o(

I stopped by here instead of my regular... They have your basic $20 pedicure, same as down the road... but when she showed me the sheet it seemed like you had to upgrade $5 to get the 10 minute massage... BUT, there was also the 10% off to consider and I was literally in the chair for 1.5 hours! (all in all I paid $32 for the pedicure/callus removal/paraffin wax, My splurge since I became a Grandma yesterday!) There was a mint oil massage after the (cucumber) sugar rub. It was a very enjoyable pedicure. I will also mention that fluet English was spoken (in addition

.Granted it is Phoenix Children's Hospital... but they are wonderful! Dr Siaw was able to put my child at ease and I am very comfortable with the treatment plan in place. I am also THRILLED that there is now a Westside location, even if the procedure can not be done at at location .. it is great to hit the appointments at the Westside location!
