The only reason they get 2 stars is because I half way enjoyed myself the first time I went there the night that basically everyone in phx lost power a few weeks back .. Even then it wasn't all that great. Last time I wanted to order the French dip or English dip so badly but no one wanted to wait.   Tonight I'm sitting at home so hungry and pretty sick and wanted something other than McDonalds or filbertos so I call and ask when their kitchen closes and they told me 1230, I said thank you! And they just hung up. Rude . I called back and ordered food. I get there to pick it up and told me they actually didn't even have one of the items I had ordered and when I get home excited to eat my French dip.. There was not even any aju sauce for the sandwich. I went against the bad review for this sandwich because I thought the person was just complaining about every little thing.. But I too feel the same way.. No aju and it was not very good at all .. Probably will not be back.   Like I get it.. It's pub food but I have worked in many in the past that were better quality. Js.. I'm the most non picky and laid back person. It takes a lot for me to even write a review .

This place has always been awesome, especially the car service people. I feel they have always been extremely friendly and honest. I'll always recommend them

It should be an option review a place with no stars.  There are no excuses for me to pay over $100 for a transmission flush and 3 weeks later when I get an oil change somewhere else and they tell me I need to get my transmission flushed ASAP .. So what were they doing while I sat in the waiting room for over an hour, waiting for my car to have it's transmission flushed ?
