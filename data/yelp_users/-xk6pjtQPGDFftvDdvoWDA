I would have to echo all the bad reviews on this page. Getting a hold of classic is next to impossible. When you finally do get a hold of them, they mess up your order or change the price in some way. They OVERCHARGE a lot. I would spend an extra few seconds on google and find a better rental place. Everything looks great in the warehouse, but when it comes to setting it up for the wedding, it looks disappointing.

This place is beyond horrible. My wife and I were looking for a washer and dryer for the July 4th sale. We found a great pair and we're ready to buy them. We looked around and found an associate, who told me he would call someone over to the appliances section. After waiting for 5 minutes, we go over to the front of frys and ask another salesman and he directs us to the mobile team to help out. We finally get someone from the mobile team and he tells us he's in training and doesn't really know appliances. I will never come back to this pathetic excuse for a store. I will gladly take my business elsewhere.

Fast and very friendly. Highly recommend Levi! Levi gave me a window of 12-2, but arrived exactly at 12:15. He took a look around the house and measured and adjusted the locks within 15 minutes. He is very good at his craft and efficient.
