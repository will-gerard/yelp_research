this place was a really nice surprise on a sunday. we had decided to take our bikes out and enjoy the nice weather. of course i was hungry, so we ended up in the saketini/oregano's plaza looking for some food. dragonfly looked cute and inviting so we thought, why not?  when we walked in, only three tables were full and we were immediately sat by the host/waiter/jack of all trades. things that you must get here:  1. citrus white iced tea 2. cream cheese shrimp rolls 3. anything with their charbroiled beef 4. anything with their charbroiled shrimp  the food was absolutely delicious. i had the shrimp spring bowl which came with an overabundance of charbroiled shrimp, veggies, noodles, mint, and a tasty egg roll. i couldn't get enough of it. i loved the pickled cucumbers and carrots and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. the cream cheese shrimp roll was freaking awesome. i had never seen an egg roll stuff with cream cheese/shrimp before but i want to go back and eat 50 of them and then hate myself. it would be so worth it.  between the two guys that were manning the floor (it got as busy as 6 tables when we were there) they did a great job being attentive and being ninja drink refillers. really a great first experience and i can't see myself not going back there. yay dragonfly!  PS... they don't serve banh mi here but the waiter was kind enough to let me know the sammich hook up on Elliot and Warner.

Contracted initially based on home warranty claim.  Exceptionally unprofessional. I had confirmed for a 7a - 11a maintenance window. I was home the entire time. 1050a rolls around and still no call or anything from the technician. I had to call the company and ask if anyone was still coming. I was told that the technician must have gotten hung up on a previous job and that they would call me shortly. 12:15p rolls around and still no call so I call yet again only to be told that the technician came at 7am and no one was home. Absolutely crap. Not only were both my husband and myself home, but our dogs would have immediately ran to the door and caused a big fuss if someone had knocked or rang the bell.  Instead I look at my security gate to see a card sitting there. Woman on the phone tells me that because there were no cars in the driveway (Duh... they are in the garage.. the door isn't opening, lady) that he just assumed no one was home and now they have to reschedule.  I rearranged my schedule per their maintenance window and made sure that I was available at the appropriate time and they do not even have the decency to ring the door bell. Customer Service at this establishment is exceedingly poor. I would never ever do business with them.  Also checked numerous websites (BBB, ripoffreport.com, etc...) and found that unsurprisingly they have a large number of complaints for work they did when they actually do show up.

not impressed.  food was lacking (cheese enchilada tasted like rubber and beans were over cooked) and service was mildly attentive. with so many great mexican food places here in arizona, i am glad that i dont have to be stuck with Serrano's.

i'll admit it: i've gotten old. i hate going out on NYE. i hate dealing with the drunk masses that inevitably have popped collars and think Pabst Blue Ribbon is the bombdiggity. sure, i could solve that problem by going to a friend's place to party, but then i have to drive home and let's face it, i like to get my drink on. driving home just blows. so, we have a nye tradition (in its second year) of staying home, eating chinese food, drinking, and watching movies. it works out pretty well except for the fact that we hadn't found a great chinese food place yet.  enter Golden Gate Chinese restaurant. i had driven by this place almost every day since i moved here in December 09 and always wondered what kind of restaurant didn't have windows. i'm serious. the entire building = windowless. it looked more like a money laundering operation than it did a chinese food place. since we really had exhausted our chinese options around the area, we figured we might as well try Golden Gate for new years. hell, if it was horrible, we could always have frozen pizza.   much to our surprise, we found that Golden Gate was freaking fantastic. we ordered the crab angels (crab wontons), mushu pork, veggie friend rice, and honey walnut shrimp. this stuff was like crack! i think we demolished everything. the honey walnut shrimp was a perfect combo of sweet honey and crispy walnuts. they didnt drown the shrimpies which was much appreciated. the crab angels kicked ass. you know how when you order crab wontons at places and they give you a metric ass ton of wonton and a tiny dab of crap in the middle? not this place. they were like sacks (crunchy, tasty sacks) FILLED with crabby cream cheesy deliciousness. the veggie fried rice was perfect and the mushu pork rocked. they didnt put the plum sauce in it and left it on the side so you could add as much as you wanted.   no, they dont have delivery but the food is definitely worth the effort of take out or dine in. i might even have to try dining without windows sometime :)

i probably would have given this place at least 4 stars had it not been for the two pushy guys at the beginning. let me explain....  i rolled up to the carwash because my car needed a little TLC. i hadn't really washed it since i moved here (in december.. i know, for shame) so i figured it needed a hose down before i let any of my coworkers in it. i had seen the Arizona Auto Wash and figured it just may be my best bet. i pulled up and was greated by a pretty friendly young man. i told him i wanted the VIP car wash. he says sure, then pauses and starts on this whole upsell speech:   him: you know we have a detail special... me: i'm not interested but thank you him: but its only $70 me: i dont have the time right now, its my lunch hour (at this point i'm getting annoyed) him: oh no problem you can use it any time! you just have to buy it now me: no thank you him: i'll even throw in todays wash for free! me: (walking towards the cashier) no thank you. i'm fine him: aw c'mon me: seriously? (insert disbelief at his desperation here)  so after that ever so delightful and annoying exchange, yet another guy comes up to me:  other guy: i see that you have a chip in your windshield me: wtf? no i dont. other guy: yes you do (points to the very bottom of the windshield). if you have your insurance i can fix it up for you right now (already has paper work in hand) ***at this point i'm suspicious. i go over my car at least once a week to check for any new dings/chips*** me: (walks up to windshield and realizes the "chip" he pointed out was actual crusted on resin) um, no thats ok. i'll take it into my dealer other guy: you sure? me: yes i'm sure. do you guys always ask a second time?  so after being thoroughly annoyed, i went inside to pay the cashier and wait for my car to be cleaned. sure, i thought about taking it somewhere else but i had already wasted 20 minutes of my lunch hour and i just wanted the damn thing scrubbed. i watched cnn and 30 minutes later, voila..... my non detailed, chip free car was done. magically that 'chip' on the windshield even disappeared.   i give props to the people that actually clean the car. they did a nice job. i would suggest, however, that AZ Auto Wash get rid of those two guys at the front. they just piss me off.

In California if you went to a Home Depot and someone actually grunted at you there, you were completely lucky. You might as well run straight away and buy a lottery ticket, because grunts from CA Home Depot employees only happen when the stars are aligned and some moon is in your house and some crap. You know what I mean.  It's the complete opposite here at the Home Depot on Country Club. Being a new home owner, I practically live at Home Depot. It's not like I'm handy to begin with so walking into this place full of DIY items and crazy crap I've never ever heard of before, I feel extremely overwhelmed. Lucky for me the staff here at this Home Depot are extremely friendly and helpful. Not only will they take the time to walk me to the aisle where the drywall anchors are, but they will also ask me about my project, if i had any questions, and if I needed help with anything else. A Home Depot employee spent 30 minutes with me picking out the right bug killing spray because I really wanted to go all Terminator on some cricket's asses. 30 minutes. So nice.   I plan on coming back to this particular Home Depot often for all my crazy home needs. Next project: Installing the garbage disposal. Pray for Mojo.

i pretty much love this place. yes, i understand that in order to get phenomenal sushi, i should probably go to some place on the west coast with instant access to the freshest seafood possible butttttttt since i live in arizona and really dont feel like hopping on a plane to LA every weekend, i'm going to make due with what i have which is Ichi Ban.   i love this place for many reasons:  1. 1/2 price on sushi rolls when you order 5 or more (dine in only) 2. super friendly sushi chefs that are extremely hilarious and will take pictures with you. 3. fun atmosphere with an easy access sushi bar 4. they serve alcohol (yes, i know you expect this from restaurants but i always like to point out the fact some place as liquor because, well, i'm a lush sometimes. yes, sometimes.) 5. variety of sushi and specialty rolls 6. you can have teppanyaki if you really want to.  i mean really, how could you go wrong? well, you could just inherently suck, but who's judging? the past 4 times i've gone i've had a great experience with excellent service and tasty sushi goodness. so happy ichi ban is right around the corner :)

first off, never had the food here. i have priorities. these priorities kinda go something like this: 1. alcohol/breathing (cant drink if you can't breathe) 2. sleep 3. tivo (god, i love my tivo) 4. food  food is low on the totem pole, but beer would be ranked #1 which is why i do heart the old chicago. i'm a card carrying member of the world beer tour which i find completely awesome. OC has themed beer tours at least once a month. you basically drink the series of beers within the tour, get your tour points on you world beer tour card, and get a neat tshirt (ie st patricks day = who's your paddy? tshirt. awesome.).   did i mention their ginormous list of beers? yes, ginormous. its a word. i swear. they have a metric ass ton. belgian,german,mexican,canadian,and nicely ghettoized schlitzy goodness. you really can't help but find a beer on their menu that you like.   so far i havent completed an entire tour ( :( ) but i'm workin on it!

i've been coming here to mainly get my eyebrows done now for about 2 years. i love this place. it's extremely clean, the staff is super friendly, and i can almost always just walk in and  get my eyebrows done without an appointment. it does get rather busy saturday/sunday so make sure you call prior to going over to see if they have any open slots.

i loved it here! walking in it was really nice to see that almost every table was filled and that everyone looked pretty happy. we decided to sit at the sushi bar where we were greeted by the nicest sushi chefs ever! they were super friendly, talkative, and created some really delicious tasty goodness. it instantly felt like i was in someones living room having some really good food.   shimagamo also has what looks to be an outstanding happy hour. i havent tried it yet but i plan on being a regular so i'll let you know how that goes :).  definitely the best sushi experience i've had since moving to Phoenix. love it!

When you have people come up to you during your wedding saying things like "The food at your wedding is so good... it's better than my wedding" you know you have an amazing caterer.   Lena's Flowers and Catering did an absolutely fantastic job at our wedding! Working with the vendor was an absolute breeze. We were able to do a great tasting which helped us narrow down our selection ( sooooo many options!) and were extremely impressed with the chef and the professionalism. We opted to do a buffet to give everyone a taste of everything and we are so glad we did! People raved about the Prime Rib and Pork Tenderloin and they couldn't get enough of the sun dried tomato/garlic mashed potatoes! Everything was really delicious and prepared perfectly.  Flowers were also fantastic! I utilized this vendor for my bouquet, my MoH's bouquet, and boutonnieres and corsages. I was so appreciative of the time they took during the consultation and also the fact that they didn't try to shove traditional bouquets down my throat. They really listened to my ideas and offered some amazing flower suggestions. When the bouquets arrived, I couldn't believe how pretty and unique they were!  Totally a pleasure working with this vendor and would do it again in a heartbeat!

i love Subway. i really do. usually its fast, healthy, and one of those work lunches that doesnt make you want to curl up under your desk and take a little nap during the afternoon.   i do not love this particular Subway. they are ridiculously slow. i dont know whether its due to the fact that employee's aren't quite seasoned or if they just dont care. they also have a strange assembly line thing going on. one guy does bread/meat cheese. one guy does some of the veggies and the last guy puts on your 'sauce'. this creates a giant cluster if one of the guys asks you a question that doesnt apply to his section. that means the next guy is going to ask you the same question again or he'll lean over and ask the first guy. well, thats even if the first can remember the sandwich he's making after youve told him for the fourth time.  i can deal with the lack of efficiency and the very distracted sammich makers, but i really wasnt a fan of the cashier who decided to bring up the latest tragedy in Tuscon and give me her whole opinion on the situation. i just stared at her blankly and prayed to the cashier gods that the register wouldnt break. i just want my damn sammich, not a lesson in political leanings. thanks.

i love me some blimpies. this location is especially fast, clean, and super friendly.  unfortunately, i went to get my blimpie's on (that didn't come out right) but found a really sad notice taped to the window and the doors locked. apparently the rent hasn't been paid in a while and the landlord has repossessed the place. so for now, no more blimpies. hope they get it together and open the doors again

i had a really good time at western skies golf club. i've been away from the game of golf for quite a few years for various reasons (i'm lazy, i couldn't find fun people to play with, childhood resentment... ya know the story) but i've been lucky enough to find a decent group of people to play with again. one of them happened to choose western skies on a random friday morning. why not?  the course is pretty well maintained as are the golf carts and the facilities. pricing is reasonable as well however they do ding you an extra $8/pp for a GPS unit. i found that i really never even paid attention to it so my recommendation would be to leave it out. the carts come with a little mini ice chest and ice is provided before you take off.   holes are well laid out and there are a few water hazards that could give you some trouble. other than that its a pretty basic course with a bathroom stop at the 9th hole. oh and the beverage cart lady makes pretty regular rounds. they had a nice special going with $2 rolling rocks. delightful.   i shot like crap but i had a good time. well played, western skies. well played.

not only does this place have an amazing selection of beer, wine, and liquor it also has one of the comfiest, friendliest, fantastic bars down stairs.   let's start with the upstairs: basically if you want to drink, they have it. i have found random and unknown beers here at reasonable prices. their wine selection is ginormous but the staff has created personal reviews that they display which really does help. normally i go by which bottle has the prettiest label but that doesn't always result in success. they also have over 100 different kegs available at prices lower than bevmo. people that work here are really friendly and knowledgeable and provide great recommendations on stuff to try.  downstairs: its like rolling into your friends living room and having a drink. i have missed my local bar ever since i moved to arizona and had really never been able to find a place like it until i walked downstairs. its kind of a two parter.. theres the main area when you first walk down. it also serves as a wine cellar. there's a larger room off to the side where you can listen to live music and have a little more space to stretch out. i prefer the cellar area since its close to the bar and i like staring at a ton of wine in one place. you can order anything thats on tap or walk up stairs and grab something out of the freezers (like you're at a friends place...except you have to pay) and bring it back down. normally there is only one guy on duty so you have to be patient when it comes to ordering from the bar or getting your tab but they are so damn friendly that it doesn't bother you.   have i found my local bar? yes. am i slightly concerned about becoming an alcoholic? hell no, i dont go to meetings :).

being from LA, im a huge fan of the DIY KBBQ experience so i was pretty sad to learn that most kbbq places in AZ didnt let you cook your own stuff on the table. well, i was sad until a friend suggested we try Takamatsu! grills on the table, baby! i am the master of my own meat domain! (stop laughing).   i instantly loved this place the minute we walked through the door. the smell was incredible... all the tasty galbi, seafood, and bulgogi sizzling on the table top grills. i was in heaven. the menu was extensive and included some really good cuttlefish and cuts of meat. we ordered a lot and ate a lot. the quality of the vegetables, meats, and side dishes was excellent and i couldn't have been happier.  the wait staff is extremely nice and personable, often coming to the tables to laugh and joke with you. they are also really quick to fill up your glass or offer you another beer. angels in meat heaven. i'm definitely coming here anytime i need a kbbq fix.

truly meets the definition of hidden gem.  the boyfriend and i have a great sunday tradition. on saturday night we open up Yelp and search for new places we haven't had breakfast at yet and then try them out sunday mornings. it's a great way to learn different areas and discover some delicious food. so, we were looking at the area around us in Chandler and noticed a little pin located within the Chandler airport. it didn't seem possible that there could be a restaurant there so we did some more research and found their facebook page. indeed they were open 7 days aweek for breakfast and lunch. we thought we 'd give them a shot.  i'm so glad we did! located right in the middle of the private airport, the hangar cafe gives you the ability to stare at awesome personal places while munching on some serious diner style breakfast. the portions are pretty large, so be prepared to be full. i had the hangar cafe eggs/hashbrowns standard staple and it was great! eggs cooked to order with crispy hashbrowns. the coffee is pretty decent too.  i'd recommend getting there while the church crowd is still occupied. it can get pretty busy and a wait for a patio table can take up to 40 minutes during peak times. you want to sit on the patio so you can look at all the planes taxi and take off. this place is also super kid friendly. a lot of the people who own the planes will let the kids approach when the engines are off to take a peak inside. really a whole lot of fun for the kids or the kid in you :).

full disclosure: me - not indian. so don't really look at me as a trusted source for all things indian. sure, i have tons of indian friends who have been kind enough to cook for me and to initiate me into the 'we love bollywood movies' fan club, but i definitely am no expert. so with that said, take this review for what it is: an observation from someone who misses all the indian goodness she left behind in LA  alright, so india plaza. first off, love the name. its right to the point. im definitely not going here looking for vietnamese food. i visited the shop next to the dhaba restaurant and was pleased to meet (what i think was) the owner. really friendly guy who was more than happy to show us around and to help us find some items.   the store was clean and smelled delicious. it was stocked with all sorts of goodies. as someone who doesn't yet know how to make roti from scratch, i was pleased to see some frozen roti in the freezer section. happy aly.  i could literally spend a whole hour in here looking at all the various goodies and strange packaging. it definitely did remind me of the larger indian grocery stores back in cypress and whittier.  all in all i think this place is going to be great for me. i'll be able to experiment with different types of curry and maybe one day be brave enough to make my roti. now where did i put my chai masala?

after dealing with Southern California Edison in Los Angeles, i'm completely in super platonic love with SRP. not only are the bills ridiculously easy to understand, their online services kick ass. its so easy to pay your bill online, keep track of your usage, and see how you compare with other people with similar square footage. they also are great about sending coupons for really useful things like insulating windows and sunshades.   SRP is alright with me. i hope i never have to switch to another provider as long as i'm here.

i dont know what is was, but walking into this casino automatically created an instant calm feeling. i think it was the fact that the number of families greatly reduced the minute you stepped inside. look, i'm not against kids. i think they are completely adorable and all that. i just think vegas isnt the greatest place in the world to take them no matter how "kid friendly" the casinos attempt to make it. anyway, the casino was extremely impressive. decorated in bright colors with wide open spaces, you really didnt get the feeling that you were just in a casino, but rather that you were in a resort. i especially loved the fact that they didnt use ugly ass carpet. i hate it when you walk into a casino, look down and think "wow, that looks like someone puked on the carpet" except its the pattern. ew. yes, this place is fabulous but do be prepared to pay a bit more than say... if you were at the mirage :) but its worth it :) even if you dont stay, at least visit and take a look down the esplanade, tryst, and the waterfalls. enjoy!

this place is pretty amazing. amazing enough for my boyfriend and i to arrange our whole afternoon around.  knowing that this place is extremely well known/popular/busy/insane, we decided to strategically plan our outing in downtown phoenix directly around when Pizzeria Bianco opened for dinner and i'm really glad we did! we were able to be seated within 20 minutes ( know... 20 minute wait when they just open their doors!) and were really pleased by the attentive service. the menu was full of delicious options and it was really hard to pick just one pizza to try, so we settled on two different ones and also ordered up a couple of local beers from the Prescott Brewing company.  everything was REALLY delicious. the crust of the pizza was cooked perfectly.... crispy and smoky on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. my fig and prosciutto pizza was salty and sweet. made me want to order another a pie to take home but i restrained myself.   really worth it to make the trek here! try it out. i promise you won't regret it.

"hi, i'm an over pretentious, way overcrowded, too cool for you club that likes to treat its guests like crap yet they still come for more." oops, sorry. i let tao start writing its own review. a large group of 60 of us (yes 60) went to Tao on a friday night hoping to shake our asses off, get drunk, and have a fabulous time. what happened? practically the opposite. first, months in advance we had arranged to be "VIP" at this place and allow all 60 of us in ahead of the rest of the line, get bottle service, and have a table. so we show up at tao in full force and what are we told? we dont see you on the list. whoa whoa wait asshole. we prepaid. we have a contact name. he doesnt work here? kiss my ass. so all 60 of us get in the stupid large line that wraps around the venetian lobby until one of us bitches enough that the nazi bodyguards go into the club to find the elusive contact. 40 minutes later said contact shows up outside apologizing. oh yes of course the list. all 60 of us FINALLY get to go ahead of the line and get in the club. glorious. yes, the inside was absolutely lovely. very well decorated lending towards the more erotic tastes with the ladies whipping each other in the halls. we are then herded upstairs to the apparent "VIP" part of the club only to find the damn place packed to the hilt. you can't even get on the dance floor and if you manage to, you cant dance because you can barely move. drunk fuckers are falling all over you in attempts to either feel up on you or just because they can no longer stand. guys get belligerent and attempt to start fights with your boyfriend. your hot high heels begin to hurt and you just want to sit down but you cant because theres no fucking seating and the "contact" apparently failed to mention that you dont get a table or bottle service for the price you paid. the entire fucking club has these plush seats and long tables but you cant get near them without shelling out $400 a bottle. oh and if you do lean against something, a nazi bodyguard is quickly in your face to tell you to "move along". apparently i didnt pay the "leaning against the wall cover charge". assholes. all in all, not a great experience. if i wanted over pretentious and assholey, i'd just go back to my hometown. at least i can sit down there.

words can not describe the epic douchefactor that axis/radius possesses. so why did i come here? two friends of mine were in from LA and they wanted to hit up Scottsdale and see what it was like. i have lived here for a year... A YEAR, PEOPLE!... and had yet to go to Scottsdale to experienced the ultimate in popped collars and sick belt buckles. so, i agreed to to take them out for an unforgettable night on the town.   walking up to this place, we immediately noticed the long ass line full of extremely cold OSU/Auburn people attempting to get in. apparently this place charges a $10 cover but after a brief chat with the lovely bouncer, he let us through the other side for free. $10 cover in Phoenix? c'mon. the place is kind of interesting when you first walk in. you're faced with a choice: gravitate towards the rhythmic thumping of the techno on the Radius side OR shake what your mamma gave you to some hip hop on the Axis side. we explored Axis first. the people watching was AWESOME. drunk frat boys trying to score with equally if not drunker girls dressed in super shorts skirts, 8 inch heels, and no jackets because wearing a jacket when its 42 degrees outside is so lame. i also dug the older gentlemen who were stalking the younger ladies. they were pretty damn entertaining. i do have to say that the bartenders really were on point. they were fast, friendly, and knew their shit. i was grateful since drinking was pretty much required to get through the night.  the Radius side really didnt fair any better. actually, it was more sausage festy than Axis. lots of guys standing around with their Monsters + Vodka watching the spare population of girls dance. it looked like a grade school dance with boys on side and girls on the other, neither side willing to touch each other. Radius was definitely a lost cause.  i think i would have been super pissed if i had had to pay cover to get into this place, but seeing as it was free and the bartenders and people watching were entertaining, i guess it deserves 2 stars. i do reserve the right to bitch slap some sense into anyone who wants to go here though.

$31.95 for the saturday champagne/bloody mary brunch, and oh my god was it worth it. i drank that much in mimosas :) prime rib, rack of lamb, king crab legs, made to order omelets, and one insane dessert station.... i've never eaten so much in my entire life. i went back for fourths. it was a VERY VERY long meal and the fact that they kept bringing me alcohol didn't spur me to go any faster. definitely a high point in my dining experiences in las vegas. if you have a chance to go, take it and drink your money's worth but PLEASE dont forget the amazing food :)

**full disclosure** i only came here for drinks, not the food.   a group of us walked into carly's after our holiday lunch in order to grab some drinks and get our evening started. we were greeted with a look of disgust (we werent even rowdy!) and poor service. the place was empty save 2 other people but it took about 25 min to get our 4 beers and 2 cocktails. i was kind of disappointed because i really wanted to like the place. there was great music and it really had the potential to be a great hangout spot in the future.  we left after we finished our 1 drink. sorry, Carly's. you really missed the mark.

how can you not love a place who's logo is a panda bear dressed in a sombrero? its completely impossible. the hilarity alone sold me but the mere fact that this place serves two cuisines that i could eat every day for the rest of my life doesn't really hurt either.  just to warn you, if you're not prepared you may be overwhelmed by the menu at first. there are a lot of check boxes, a lot of acronyms, a lot of "what the hell did i just tell the woman i wanted to eat?". have no fear, they have pictures for some recommended combinations.  i suggest going with those for first timers. it just makes your life easier and the only question you really have to answer is what kind of rice you want. not so bad. they also give you a goodly sized snickerdoodle cookie to munch on after you've gorged yourself on chinamex food. seriously, is this place trying to make me fat? i know, they didn't hold a gun to my head but i felt obligated to eat the whole thing + cookie. it was my duty =p.

this place saved the night!  for my birthday my boyfriend was putting together an evening with our friends. we'd drink some wine, have some tasty goodness, and just have a lot of fun. he called up Postino's East the Tuesday before the night out and made a reservation for 8 people at 7pm. all set right? WRONG. when we arrived at 7pm we were notified that they did not in fact have our reservation and the place was packed so it'd be a 1.5 hour wait. wth? no bueno :(. a friend suggested we try the Euro Cafe at the end of the street. i'm really glad we did!  Euro Cafe was exceptionally nice and was able to put together a couple of tables for the group (including a baby). service was extremely friendly and their selection of wines and desserts was fantastic! i ordered the "Morning After" cake and couldn't believe how delicious it was! apparently the white cake was soaked in sangria and included white chocolate, chocolate granache, and this strawberry chutney that had the most perfect strawberry flavor. loved it!  thank you for saving the birthday evening, Euro Cafe! i'll be back to try all those desserts in the case ASAP :)

being new to the area, i'm really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican i've got down i think, but the other two i've kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yupha's one day.   the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise you'll be whacking people in the head with it.  i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, i'd definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yupha's also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it.   service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yupha's is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!

the service here is pretty awful. i thought that maybe it was a one off thing so i came here again today and found the same story.... extremely long lines and incompetent baristas.   the store itself is a hot mess. the service bar is extremely dirty, the floor looks like it hasn't been mopped in ages, and there are various spills around the store that haven't been cleaned up. the employees look uninterested or half a sleep and even though there were 6 of them behind the counter today, only 2.5 really appeared to be working at all (and really really really really slowly). of the 2.5 working, the girl at the counter was less than friendly and gave me a blank stare when i asked for my drink (americano). she rung up the coffee and the yogurt i purchased with zombie like speed. eye contact was kept to a minimum because apparently she had an allotment today and couldn't waste any.  the two behind the bar were just... sigh. the guy working the espresso machines could only do one task at a time which meant that multitasking and getting drinks out was out of the question. he had to stop to steam 1 pitcher of milk then press one button to get some coffee... dude, i know there are two steam wands back there and why dont you have a supply of popular dairy already steamed? that crap goes quick! also, don't make drinks out of order... it pisses people off. when you pick a cup that was just placed there and ignore the 7 already sitting there, you make people want to jump over that counter and take over your job. girl on cold station... she looked extremely lost and couldn't find lids for over 7 minutes (that's why she's a .5 person). disaster.  i won't be going back to this store and giving them my  money anytime soon. id rather drive over to mcclintock and guad. they have their act together.

im always afraid that my air conditioning unit is going to break down and not only will i be stuck in my house sweating buckets, but my wallet would be super sad. on recommendation, i called up Schiller to do an annual inspection. the were extremely friendly on the phone and i was able to set up an appointment for the next week.  when i set my appointment, i had asked that they call me 30 min prior to showing up so i could leave work and run back home. that didn't happen and while that could have been annoying, schiller made up for it. they did call me when he had arrived at my house but i gave them the go ahead to just start work since the AC is on the roof. the AC guy hung around until i was able to get out of work and was super apologetic about the not calling thing. he did an extremely thorough job checking the AC, made some indoor vent recommendations (i learned quite a bit about AC units/systems that day) and was just the nicest guy you could ever meet.  once in a while they do a special in conjunction with SRP where you can get their checkup for only $29. unfortunately i had missed the cut off date but still thought that the $59 i spent was well worth the piece of mind for the summer.

simply freaking delicious. yup, thats the right way to describe it. i just finished the most fantastical sammich ever: The Carne Adovado. oh yes, this this is tastiness sitting on a delightfully sweet french bread roll. the carnitas meat is seasoned to perfection. its juicy, lightly spicy and just coats your mouth with tasty goodness. that sounded wrong but i dont care. this thing is awesome.   oh and i have been here for breakfast. i got the az bread co omelet which was also damn tasty. covered in this nacho cheesy sauce, the omelet is ginormous and filled with sausage, mushrooms, cheesy goodness, and a variety of other things i cant remember i just remember that i couldnt stop eating it. the side potatoes are also great. they are like nicely fried french fries that have been cut into manageable little squares. i was pretty addicted.  so yes, i guess ive found my go to sammich place for when i need some delicious pork.

no one has written about this location? well, fine. i guess a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.  i love Pete & Mac's! recommended by my vet (AZ Animal Wellness Center), i called them up to set a grooming appointment for my super hairy dog who has a tendency to go out in the backyard and roll around in the grass. the receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful. she offered to contact the vet in order to get Penny's vaccination papers. loved that!  the place is extremely clean and very cute. they have a small retail area when you first walk in and large windows so you can see the dog play area and observe all the dogs (and the extremely vigilant p&m employee) rolling around and having a good time.   Filling out the forms for Penny's appointment was fairly fast and easy. I dropped an extremely dirty dog off at noon and came back when they called me at 3 to find a very happy, clean, good smelling pup when i got back. they did a great job on her nails and teeth and it seemed like Penny really adored the groomer (that never happens). Definitely a great, pleasant experience at Pete & Mac's

i have found my boba place!  i really dig the street. it's cute, friendly, and really convenient. located in the saketini/oregano's strip mall area, this place is a refreshing little joint that offers a wide array of milk tea choices and even has a milk tea/ramen special for $7. nice.  i had the Taro Milk Tea with boba and i was a happy camper. like other reviewers have said, they only serve the large size so be prepared to hold a lot of liquid. the boba itself is really tasty and not too hard but has that right, firm consistency that makes it fun to chew on a little but wont kill you if you try to swallow it whole.  accessible by bike, this place is going to be seeing a metric ass ton of me.

i LOVE everyone in this office. platonically of course. i cannot believe that i held out so long to try another get. i got Penny earlier this year through Lucky Dog Rescue and they use the Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic. not really knowing much about the whole process in the first place, i stuck with the SVC and was really unhappy with their service. a friend of mine at work suggested i should check out the Arizona Animal Wellness Center and i'm so glad i did.  every tech and doctor is extremely nice and genuinely cares about your pet. they are extremely friendly and completely helpful even when you ask newbie dumb questions. they take the time to listen and really offer great advice instead of just shoving you through the exam, taking your money, and pushing you out of there as fast as they can. their basic exams work on a 30 min schedule instead of a 10 so you do get more time with the doctor and your pet gets the attention that they deserve.   i couldnt be more happy with the service that the center provided and i was extremely impressed when they followed up to see how Penny was doing . i've never had a vet do that. i will definitely be going back here for all of her vet needs.

this place is pretty legit. they have dol sot bi bim bop WITH A REAL RAW EGG. mmm tasty goodness. i love when that egg cooks perfectly in the hot mixture of rice, veggies, and beef. so delicious.  service here is great. very attentive even though they have 1 or 2 waitresses max on any given night. they definitely hustle and make sure that you have everything you need. atmosphere of the place is comfortable and clean. you feel welcome to spend your time enjoying your food and relaxing.  try the dol sot bi bim bop or the short ribs. both dishes are absolutely delicious and come with all the tasty korean sides (kimchi, sprouts, potato salad, spinach and so on). you'll feel like your stomach will explode with tastiness at the end of your meal.   they also have the hot tofu soup too which i havent tried yet, but i'm definitely coming back a ton so i'm sure i'll pretty much figure out the menu for ya :).

one of the best tri tips that i have ever purchased. that piece of meat was freaking delicious was totally reasonable! its been so hard to find decent quality meat since i moved here. safeway, fry's, walmart (bwahhaha no way am i buying cuts of meat from there), and other grocers just dont have high quality cuts of meat. you might luck out at an albertsons or if youre feeling froggy you'll head over to AJ's and shell out a pretty penny.  Von Hanson's is my answer to my lack of meat happiness. all the butchers were super friendly and very helpful when it came down to picking out something for dinner that night. all of their product looks delicious and fresh. i cant wait to try the filets or the ribeyes.   i cant believe this place is in walking distance of my house. eff ever going vegetarian. that would just be wrong.

i'm pretty much 97% low maintenance. my exception? my hair. i have a fro. a giant, curly fro. i tame said fro every day with my trusty flat iron. unfortunately, while i was taming the beast yesterday my chi turbo decided that it wanted to die on me. it just couldn't take it anymore. honestly, i don't blame it. i abused that sucker. so while i was grieving i realized that i would pretty screwed come monday for work. i can't let the peeps know that i'm a curly ginger. so i hopped online in search of the nearest beauty supply because my ass needs instant gratification and can't wait for a shipment from amazon.  i come upon Ulta. the website looks great. tons of products. i check out their line of flat irons and do some of my own research on a few (t3, sedu, and other chis). i head on down to Ulta and see a great store front with tons of product. i'm excited. i head in hoping to be able to ask a few questions. i mean if youre gonna drop a little $$ on something, you really wanna know everything about it right? i walk in and notice only 2 girls in the front. both were busy. thats ok, i just went to the back to check the flat irons out myself. soooo many to choose from. i was slightly overwhelmed. i thought i had hit the retail jackpot when i spied an Ulta employee walking by the rack. i snagged her and asked her if she recommended anything. our conversation went a little like this:  me: hi, i was wondering if you could help me. i wanted to buy a flat iron but had a few questions her: questions? me: yeah, like which do you recommend for fewer fly aways? which has a better shelf life? which doesnt burn the crap out of your hair her: um. i use the hot tools one. $20. me: do you use it every day? does it damage your hair a lot? her: i use it once in a while. me: ok how bout for someone who uses it every day? her: i dont know me: what? her:  i dont know just pick one. me: seriously? her: yeah. i havent used any except that one and i dont know about the others me: um... i'll be going over here now....  Ulta is amazing if you know exactly what you want, don't have any questions, and just want to walk in and put your hand on the product of your choice. Ulta DOES NOT have amazing customer service nor does it have knowledgeable sales people. after the awkward conversation i had asked her if anyone else would be able to help me. i just got a shrug as she walked away. yeaaaaa... no thanks.  when my blackberry is more helpful than someone who is supposed to be able to sell the product to me in their own store, then we have a problem.

its the monday after a whirlwindish weekend in vegas. my head is throbbing, my stomach is slightly nauseous, and i'm sitting here with my camera in my hand flipping through the memories of this past weeked. WHY DO I NOT REMEMBER A DAMN THING? oh thats right. i had waaaaaayyyyyy too much to drink in a short amount of time. so as i flip through my camera i notice the following:  1. me looking relatively sober. i remember this pic. i think we were getting ready to go out. oh look how happy i look. 2. me at Tao. yes. i went to Tao. i remember that.  3. me at Diablos with friends. where the hell is Diablos? how did we get there? did we take a cab? who's that weird guy in the back?  4. me with my head in between the boobs of a woman sittng on the bar who is pouring alcohol down my throat. from the looks of her she works there. god, i hope she works there. do i remember this? not so much. 5. jagerbombs. lots of them. in a row. who bought these?  6. tequila shots!?!???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? wtf is wrong with my friends? 7. me smiling and sitting next to some guy. vague memories of him being from alaska maybe? alabama? one of the A states. sure why not.  i woke at 11a the next morning with a vague memory of awesomeness. according to my friends' accounts, i was in rare form and diablo's was there to provide all sorts of alcoholic debauchery. i also somehow managed to completely lose my treo and my dignity. 4 stars, diablo's.

I have participated in bountiful baskets for a couple of months now and I cannot tell you how happy I am! For $16 ($1 processing fee plus $15 actual food purchase) you get so much, you really. Ant go wrong. While I understand that getting random veggies and fruits may screw up a meal plan, I think BB gives you the chance to try different things and help you get creative with weekly dining.  Ordering is done on Monday and Tuesday for pickup the following Saturday. I know that getting up at 8am can be a hard one especially after during a serious hangover, but the volunteers at BB make the process extremely fast so you're out of there before you can even think about headaches and hurling. I pick up at the Shawnee Park spot in Chandler and couldn't be happier.  Honestly, I don't think I could go to the grocery store and buy the BB quality fruits and veggies I get for $16. This is a great deal that helps you incorporate more fresh fruits and veggies into your daily diet.

came to this park to meet up with some other people for a puppy class. i have to say that i was really surprised by how nice everything was. green, grassy hills, no garbage on the floor, park provided doggie bags. a very nice place for a day picnic (NOT DURING THE SUMMER).   alot of people bring their dogs here and while i love that, i dont really appreciate irresponsible owners who let their dogs off leash and then forget about them. that does bug me but it does seem like the majority of the owners are attentive and responsible.  the water features are really gorgeous as well. a large, man made "lake" which apparently includes 5 types of fish and a really calming waterfallish area that has a great seating area to enjoy it.   i can see myself coming out here more and more with my little furry monster, but i think that early in the morning will be better as there will be less people/dogs.

being paleo, there aren't many fast food options that are quick and easy. i've got in'n'out and chipotle.... and now greek food!   my boxing gym is in the next plaza over and i thought i'd try this place after a long night of working out and not wanting to cook or clean. Greeks is a small, family owned restaurant located in the Waterfall shopping center on Alma School. it's got a really nice cozy feel to it and you know that this place is pretty legit. i believe that the owner and his daughter were working the night i walked in. they were both extremely nice and made a few recommendations on the menu. i went with the gyro plate (no pita). the price was really reasonable (~$9).  the food came fairly quickly and i was sent on my merry way. when i got home, i couldn't believe the amount of meat that was stuffed into the to go container. it was incredible! at other Greek food places i have experienced here in the valley, they usually skimp on the meat and add extra salad. not this place. the meat was juicy and flavorful, the greek salad was extremely fresh and made well, and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. perfect! i've definitely added The Greeks Grill to my fast food rotation from now on :)

this place is a staple of my work lunch rotation. i tend to always get the gyro platter with french fries instead of rice. the meat is delicious and flavorful and definitely plentiful. i'm always happy with the fries because they are the good crispy on the outside soft on the inside kind and when don't fries make a girl happy?   service is always fast and extremely friendly. they do a really nice job of packing the meal for take out (wrapping the meat in foil and compartmentalizing the sauces and salad) so that everything doesnt get all crazy and soggy. i heart me some solid greek tastiness :)

we found this place while walking in downtown for a first Friday event. i immediately loved the decor (exposed brick, some art on the walls, a really warm feel to it) and was instantly hooked by the smell wafting out of the front door.   the pizza itself is not the most outstanding thing in the world but it is pretty decent and i would love to go back and try the different pies. the sauce on the pie was pretty good, a little spicy with a tang at the end. toppings were fresh and delicious but i would have liked a little more crunch from the crust.   a really cute place to hang out at if you're in downtown mesa.i like the way this area is shaping up and turning out to be a resident friendly situation.

i really didnt expect the setup inside when i walked in. instead of a 'get in and get out' type joint, i found a pretty nice, casual sit down restaurant with an attempt at a lounge/bar area. not bad.   the menu was extensive and offered a variety of vegetarian options (i'm a meat girl so i went for the gyro). service was fast and friendly. not a bad place to go for lunch, but if you want to take out i suggest calling ahead first and putting your order in.

saw the groupon for this place and thought we'd try it out. i've always wanted to learn how to legitly cut an onion and actually disassemble a chicken. why not?  this class was great! very interactive and engaging. the chef teaching the weekend class was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough. for the first 30 - 40 min the chef walked you through a demonstration of what you would actually be doing in the kitchen, explaining technique and answering any questions you may have. after that you roll into the teaching kitchen and get started! i learned how to correctly chop an onion uniformly (and other veggies) as well as julienne. i also finally know how to hold a chef's knife correct and how not to cut off my fingers. bonus!  we also disassembled a chicken (leg, breast, wing). thats going to be extremely useful since i've decided to start breaking down my own chickens each week.   i'm really interested in the Practical Series or the Protein specific courses. i'm going to have to definitely check out their scheduled and see what i'm going to do next!

it's like eating in your best friend's living room. so warm and inviting, the tuck shop lures you in with a very friendly atmosphere and delicious looking food. we showed up with another couple (they dont take reservations) and was told it was going to be an hour wait. we were already invested and really wanted to try out the menu, so we hunkered down at the bar and selected a couple of wines and beers and chatted it up with the bartender and other staff. bartender/staff were super friendly and full of helpful tips about pairings or which dishes were the best. 30 min later our table was ready (under promise and over deliver!) and we were well on our way to a fantastic meal.  all plates are shareable so trying a little bit of everything is recommended.  started with the cheese curds (deep fried. NOM) and the wild mushroom salad. freaking fantastic, fresh, and clean. then the lamb meatballs came out. wow... just.. now i'm thinking i have to go back and eat them as i write this review. they were incredible flavorful and not gamey at all. just perfect balls of meat served on top of "spaghetti" (spaghetti squash) with a marinara sauce i wanted to steal the recipe for.   just an incredible experience that you should share with friends/family/a hot date (because you'll totally get laid)!

darkish lighting, church pews (first time i actually didnt mind sitting in a church pew), tables made of doors with glass over them, and good music. this place does a great job of setting a comfy and relaxing atmosphere right from the get go. be aware that seating is first come first serve so if you want one of the roomy booths outside, you'll have to go during the weekday or get there early on a Friday night and stake your claim. they fill up rather fast.  service was great. everyone was extremely friendly and our waitress was totally attentive. she was really patient as we picked through the menu and tried to decide what tastiness to eat. oh and did i mention that rather decent selection of beers and a cider or two? yeah, that. soooo delicious. i did see only one local beer on tap (Kiltlifter) but it didnt disturb me too much since i saw quite a few delicious Belgian and German beers. don't get me wrong, i'm all for local but i can be swayed by supreme tastiness.   i had the meat and cheese pasty, our friend had the philly cheese steak, and the boyfriend had the vindaloo. surprisingly the vindaloo did not suck. i dug the peas and the moist chicken. my meat and cheese was awesome. i mean c'mon, its meat and cheese. the sausage had a great sage-y taste to it and the cheese was uber melty. the philly cheese steak tasted EXACTLY like a delicious cheese steak from philly.   all in all, this might become my new haunt. i saw that they had great brunch specials and lots of mimosas/beer. how could i NOT come back?

cute little spa located in a very low key strip mall. i took my friend here to enjoy a little spa time on a Sunday. personnel was extremely friendly and the place was really super clean.   my friend and i enjoyed the spa facilities before our treatment. the facilities consisted of a hot tub (smallish, fits about 2 people) and a little sauna time. even though this place isnt exactly a full day spa, the hot tub and sauna did the trick and allowed us to relax a little before the fun began. my friend got a massage (which she said was excellent) and i had a mani/pedi which was done well.   all in all a good experience for a small spa. would definitely come back.

two perfectly breaded and fried drumsticks, a vanilla waffle covered in maple syrup, the creamiest mac and cheese ever, fried okra, and a huge hunk of corn bread. yes, my extremely large ass ate all of that and i don't regret it for a second.   this place is fantastic! the menu is full of all the favorites that my grandmother used to make me as a kid such as red beans, rice and gravy, cheese grits, fried okra, and any part of the chicken you want fried. you really can't go wrong. this place has something for everyone unless you're on some type of ungodly diet that doesn't allow you to have an epic cheat day.  this location is decently sized but can fill up in a heartbeat. be prepared to wait about 30 - 45 minutes for a table. it might be a little long but its totally worth it. i also recommend trying out the many flavors of kool aid or the lemonade. delicious.   for me, lolo's is a once a year type of thing because honestly, i couldn't imagine eating this on the regular and still fitting into pants that dont have an elastic waist band.

came here for a little wine and dinner with violeta h. the other night. what a cute place! the decor is adorable and comfortable. chairs are soft and comfy and the place is low lit but not too dark where you can't see your dining companion.  happy hour ends at 6 here, so get in while you can so you can try some of their more expensive wines for only $5 a glass. i really recommend the marietta zinfandel. it was so smooth and flavorful. appetizers are also around the $5 mark during happy hour. i dont recommend the prosciutto wrapped breadsticks. they were alright, just kind of awkward.   dinner is reasonably priced and they offer all sorts of things from large entrees to paninis and salads. the paninis are excellent and come with your choice of a side (soup/salad). the butternut squash soup was so creamy and rich, i could have kept eating it all night.  service was fast, friendly and attentive. loved our waitress. she was like a water ninja and she was really great about not rushing us and letting us catch up a bit.  they did have live music which i wasnt too fond of. it was a little too loud and not really my speed. other than that the whole evening was really enjoyable and i'd definitely come back here again to hit up that happy hour.

i've been searching for the Reebok Easytone shoes for about 2 weeks now. everyone and their mother is completely out of stock. i even got desperate and attempted department stores like Dillard's and Macy's. no love. and before you start, no, i dont think my butt is going to look as amazing as that chick's in the commercial. no, i dont think this crap will work in a week and i can wear bad ass mini skirts. no, i dont feel that now i can eat ho ho's but as long as i walk my ass wont be fat! i get it. its a small thing i can do to supplement my current regimen. suck it, fantasy. i'm a realist.  so i spend about 1.5 hours roaming through Chandler mall with no success. as a last ditch effort, i vaguely remembered a Dick's in the Fiesta Mall. i walked in fully expected sheer disappointment but to my surprise they actually had 3 sizes left! and one of them was just my size!  staff was super friendly and very helpful with explaining the shoe. i was in and out of the place within 30 minutes, fully satisfied with my purchase and ready to get my booty burn on. thanks, dick's! i still feel really weird that dick's used to be chick's though. just sayin.

this place is fantastic! i feel pretty guilty for not finding my dress here because everyone was so wonderful and accommodation. the experience was fabulous for both myself and my family and friends that came along.  this boutique is gorgeous and offers a wide variety of unique dresses. it is owned by a mother and daughters team and you can really see that they care about you and getting you in the right dress. they start with a mini consultation to get an idea about what you are looking for as well as the look and feel of your wedding. they also give you the opportunity to look at all the dresses and tag the ones that you want to try on. your family and friends can get settled in a very cute viewing parlor area and get ready for the show while they also prep their changing rooms for you.  uptown is awesome in the fact that they give you a slip. this helps for the modest girls that dont like to go around prancing around in their panties all day in front of strangers. they are also awesome because they help you in and out of every dress and make you feel beautiful during the process. they also are great at recommending dresses you thought would never look good on you but actually look terrific!  if you want a unique wedding dress in the valley, i suggest uptown. amazing customer service experience and amazing dresses!

great place to grab a solid cocktail and soak up some ambiance. i really dig the giant, high-backed leather chairs and the comfy sofas. the pimm's cup(s) that i had were really refreshing, lemony, and made me a happy camper. it was also the first time that i've ever had a really decent manhattan :). whiskey sours are also killer here.  a really nice place to grab a drink before dinner. i do know they serve food here but have a limited menu that would do just fine for happy hour.

Tony and his team are absolutely incredible. They definitely made our wedding day extremely special and memorable.  I found 12 West Main through a Google search and my Husband and I instantly fell in love with the venue on our first visit. Not only did we love the industrial vibe of the place, we also loved the fact that 12 West Main worked with the Mesa Arts Center for outdoor ceremonies! We also loved the fact that the venue is totally open to outside vendors but also offers amazing options with their preferred caterer and florist. Tony made it so easy to pick and choose options and customize everything just the way we want it!  Day of, Tony was absolutely incredible. With little direction, Tony and his team setup the tables, cocktail area, and ceremony area even better than the vision in my head! Tony was super creative when it came to making executive decisions and never once stressed me out. FYI - this venue has an amazing bridal suite completely with full kitchen, bathroom, and a loungey living room area. Tony also brought us some tasty snacks and checked in on us frequently to see how we were doing. I don't know how he did it, but that guy was everywhere and absolutely on top of everything!  Truly a fantastic experience to work with 12 West Main and Tony. Our day was extra amazing just because of them.

so, apparently i can't read or maybe i was too excited for the elite event at PBS studios, but i thought i read that the event started at 6pm. wrong. so there we were, 30 minutes early because i am exceptionally gifted at reading. knowing that there wasn't much open nearby and hearing the rumbling in our stomachs, the boyfriend suggested that we hit up Hsin for some tasty spicy chicken. we walked across the street, walked right in, and found a very friendly man at the register looking at us quizzically. apparently my reading ineptitude was contagious because bf walked me right past a sign that said "Summer Hours 9 - 6pm". they were closed, but the nice gentleman behind the counter was extremely nice and said that he could serve us anyway as long as we took it to go. sweet!  we ordered the spicy chicken no bread. it was delicious! tasty chicken, water chestnuts, peppers, bamboo, and an extremely large helping of broccoli made it an extremely filling, tasty, and not so bad for you meal. i couldn't believe that the man was nice enough to whip us some even though he was closed. that alone would always have me coming back but the food was also terrific! Hsin for the win :).

i had been boxing for about a year or so and was really looking for something that was more challenging and also incorporated lifting. i had heard about forever strong from someone that had gone for a couple of weeks but quit citing it was too difficult. sounded just like the thing for me!  started in january and have been going strong ever since, i can't believe what a great gym this is! the staff is extremely friendly and will take time out of their day to show you new exercises and to ensure that your technique is correct (which is extremely important and one of the things that i appreciate the most!). they also motivate you and push you to maximize your workouts and not sandbag it. everyone has a friendly smile for you and a high five at the end of a WOD.  i go about 4 times a week and can see the improvements. i look forward to the tough workouts and get excited when i can add a few more pounds to the barbell. i get really sad when i miss a day because it feels so great to get out there and kick some butt! if you are thinking of joining crossfit, i highly recommend this box. you really won't regret it!

first of all... happy hour every day. how could you go wrong with that? especially when they have a great selection of beers (domestic and craft from the area) that come in pitchers for just $5. awesome.  service was outstanding. everyone was extremely friendly and i was impressed that the manager was so involved in the operations. he was extremely nice and helped us get settled in to the restaurant (we apparently came in the wrong door) and even sent us over a complimentary pitcher because he felt bad that we were wandering around for a minute or two trying to find the entry kiosk. so unnecessary but totally nice and really just impressed the boyfriend and me.   food was freaking delicious! i had the burger and it had to be one of the best i've had since moving to AZ. it was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and came on a bun that was just the right size to contain all the juicy deliciousness. the fries were also outstanding... extra crispy on the outside but soft and happy on the inside. we also had the deviled egg dip for a starter. it was like a picnic in my mouth.   another great thing about this place is Churn next door. how could you go wrong ice cream? i can't wait to come back here and try out the amazing patio for a Sunday Funday.

great atmosphere, good happy hour, and pretty decent food. what more could you want from a local bar? located on the corner of Boston and Arizona, C&W is a pretty niced sized place with lots of bar seating and a dining area that you could bring your kids to if you really wanted. i really love the large, bay windows that they open when its nice outside and the comfy chairs that you can sink into after a long day of work.  bars on tap are pretty much on par with any other bar in the area. they do serve some four peaks ale so extra points for that. their wine list isnt too extensive but they do have a really decent selection of hard liquors.   food is also good here. look for their nightly specials. when i came here with violeta h. we had an awesome pizza/salad/drink combo for two at a really reasonable price. i've also had most of their appetizer menu and really love the italian nachos (maybe because i was a little tipsy by then, but they were delicious!).  i definitely recommend this place as the first stop of the night before you head off to the other bars in the area. its a good venue to relax, get some food in your belly, and start off with your first drinks before you head off for some debauchery :).

as far as steakhouses go, this is nice place with a good piece of meat. it has a classy steakhouse-esque ambiance (cushy chairs, dark lighting, every table setting imaginable) and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.   i feel like steakhouses are all fairly the same and this one doesn't really do anything to set itself apart. one note: sides are shareable (which is nice) so try different ones at the table.  all in a nice experience but it felt general.

nope. nope nope nope nope nope nope.  service was poor and every beer i asked for they were out of. i dont want to sit here and write a long, bitchy review so i'll just go with this: never coming here again. the end.

i like the relaxed atmosphere of this place. it's nice and dark for a dinner date and comfortable enough to grab just a glass of wine at the bar.   food here is about average. there was really nothing stand out that we had during our meal but everything was cooked well and served nice and hot. service is also good, with waiters/waitresses being friendly and attentive.bar staff is pretty nice however it gets a little crazy for them during the dinner rush and you could be left waiting for a drink for a while.  this place also has a lovely patio that is well equipped with heaters and a large fire pit. while i know it gets a little too cold in the winter to sit outside, this patio is perfect for fall and even summer nights.   all in all a decent place in chandler for some relatively swank ambiance and a good wine selection.

there are a few times in my life when i say to myself 'aly, what the hell are you still doing sitting here!?'.   we walked in for lunch on a Thursday to find the place completely empty. should have been our first clue that this was not going to end well. we sat down and ordered drinks and looked at each other with questioning eyes 'should we go? should we stay and tough it out?'. our waiter came back with 3 of the 6 drinks and let us know that there was, in fact, no diet dr. pepper. foreshadowing for the rest of the meal? methinks yes.  we all order: 1 pizza, 3 sub sandwiches, a calzone, and 3 side salads. 40 minutes later the salads finally come out. the house salads didnt look too bad with the exception of the obviously older, wilted cherry tomatoes. the caesar salad looked like they had scraped the last bit of romaine from a days old bucket. not good. i've never seen lettuce that neon yellow. another 30 minutes pass (total time invested: 1.1 hours) and the mains start coming out. while the calzone didnt look awful, it definitely was not fully cooked. still doughy in the center, there were bets being taken around the table whether or not the meats had been fully cooked.  btw, did i mention that after 1.1 hours we never had refills on our drinks?   20 minutes later (total time invested: 1.5 hours) the pizza and the subs finally come out. to give credit where credit is due, the pesto chicken pizza actually looked fairly edible and smelled delicious. the meatball sub i had was sadly uncooked. i bit into the first meatball and was met with an icy center. delicious. the turkey subs were even scarier. after opening up one of the sandwiches, my coworker found odd, rectangular cuts of what could be turkey strewn about in the middle. we weren't really sure if that was the turkey or the cheese so we convinced him that he should probably just make his sandwich vegetarian.   1 hour and 40 minutes of my life wasted. completely wasted. its been a long time since i've had such a completely terrible, nonredeemable meal. thanks, Pizza 'N Greens, for making me appreciate all the mediocre restaurants that i've been to that i previously thought were terrible. they really pale in comparison to you.

i decided that i wanted to get active and remain active again. sure, i manage to get to the gym maybe 3 days a week but c'mon, i really dont push myself like i could. i need someone (coach or trainer) to be on me 100% and get me mentally and physically focused. i was searching for sports that would provide both of those things and decided that boxing might be something for me. after hunting around and going to several gyms, i settled on devil dog boxing because of the friendly staff and the great prices (8 sessions (2 sessions per week) 1 on 1, 30 mins--$140.00).  to see if you even like it, devil dog gives you one free personal trainer try out session. i walked in thinking that this might be like other personal trainers... they talk to you alot, they try to sell you on additional crap, and at the end of the day you feel like you worked out but not like you were dying. i was so wrong. not only did my coach/trainer (Ron - he's awesome) skip all the crap, he worked me out so hard i felt sure that i was going to never move again. it was intense. for 30 min you are constantly moving and using muscles that you never knew existed. i was completely sold after the free try out and have been going now for 8 weeks. i couldnt be happier. my endurance is up, my weight is down, and im learning how to box. pretty bad ass if i do say so myself.  give it a shot. its a lot of hard work but it really is worth it in the end. you'll leave everytime feeling like you accomplished something and feeling better about yourself :).

meh. came here for a quick work lunch which turned into a bit longer than we really liked work lunch. no one was manning the hostess station so we had to find someone and ask if we could seat ourselves. after sitting for about 10 min someone finally came around and brought us menus and took our drink order. i noticed that there were only two people working the whole place (bartender and waitress) and that communication with each other was not exactly their forte.   yes, i ordered a burger (guacamole, no bun, no cheese) at the mexican place. dont shoot me for it. i just didnt feel like a food coma this afternoon would make me exceptionally productive. it was just ok. wasn't a huge fan of the fries.  overall a lackluster lunch that didnt impress. i still dont really understand why it was recommended by someone from work. never trusting them again.

Our wedding cake was SO DELICIOUS!   Grace Tari is an absolute pleasure to work with. I'm pretty sure that cake tasting was my Husband's favorite part of the entire wedding preparation process. She has so many wonderful flavor combinations that it was extremely hard to just pick three combos (one for each layer). Grace was really wonderful and listened to exactly what we wanted. We couldn't have been happier with the outcome! Our guests were super happy too and commented frequently on how moist, flavorful, and delicious the cake was. The favorite combo of the night Lemon Pistachio cake with the Lemon Raspberry filling. My fave was the Red Velvet with cream cheese but my Mom definitely loved the German chocolate cake with white chocolate and raspberry filling. All soo tasty!  Our cake as gorgeous and delicious and we couldn't ask for me. Thank you, Graceful Cake Creations, for creating such a beautiful and delicious cake!

what an amazing experience. Katie and the team at David's Bridal Collections completely made up for the crappy experience that i had at the Ahwahtukee location.  the day before had been disparaging. i had gone to DBs in Ahwahtukee and had the worst experience with an associate. by the end of the day i had pretty much resigned myself to not finding a dress that weekend and feeling sad that i wouldn't be able to pick out a dress with my mom. a friend had mentioned that maybe the location in Scottsdale would have more of the dresses i was looking for in stock so i decided to book an online appointment Saturday night for one at 11am the next morning. i am so glad i did!  first of all, the location is amazing. its extremely clean, accommodating, and much more pleasant than the Ahwahtukee location. also the staff here seem to genuinely care about finding you the right dress for that special day. we were immediately greeted by friendly staff at the front desk and within 5 minutes of wandering around and picking out dresses, Katie met with me to start trying on dresses.   in my previous review of the Ahwahtukee location i had mentioned that the associate there just threw me a corset and told me good luck! well here i was give a corset, a slip, and shoes so that i could get a more accurate picture of what the dress would look like the day of. SO MUCH BETTER. also Katie helped me in and out of every dress which was a huge time saver and waaayyyyyyyyyy easier than trying to wrestle with these monsters. she also clipped the dresses when they were too big and brought tons of cute accessories to complete the look. girl was full service and so much fun!  katie was outstanding. she brought dresses that i had personally picked out as well as some dresses she thought i may like based on the theme of the wedding and based on the answers to the many questions she asked about the day of. she actually asked questions! she was so sweet and easy to talk to. i wasn't uncomfortable with her at all and she also made my mom and friends feel welcome and part of the process. katie actually made this experience almost too wonderful because i immediately found 3 dresses i fell in love with but with her adding accessories and completing the look, i was able to find that one dress that would really make the day!!! Thank you, Katie!!  while i realize that DB is a national chain, i really think the ladies at david's bridal collections in Scottsdale go the extra mile to make this an experience. the dressing rooms are large and well kept, the store is clean and all dresses are on display, and the staff is just wonderful. i couldn't ask for a better experience!

i was looking for a comfortable yet delicious place to take the boyfriend for his birthday and the friend recommended the house. i'm soooo glad that we came here! not only is it ridiculously charming and romantic, this place can seriously serve up some delicious dishes!  for starters we had the berkshire pork belly with kimchee/udon noodles/fried egg as well as the steak tartare with fries dusted with a spice rub and avocado mousse. the pork belly was super tender and juicy with a bit of sweetness which perfectly offset the vinegar tinge of the kimchee. i loved the udon and i'm a sucker for a fried egg on top of anything so i was in heaven. the steak tartare was prepared perfectly with a great citrus taste that worked with the avocado mousse. the fries kicked ass. i mean, c'mon, who doesn't love fries?  the waiter was extremely attentive and had a whole host of great recommendations when it came to the entrees and drinks. we ordered the seared diver scallops and the pork country rib. let me warn you, the portion on the pork country rib is HUGE. i wasn't even able to finish half of it and took it home (which made a badass breakfast in the morning). the seared diver scallops were buttery and melted in your mouth.   we topped off dinner with the apple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream. holy crap that was freaking great! the perfect end to a perfect meal.  thank you, the house brasserie, for making my boyfriend's dinner fantastic and extremely enjoyable. we will definitely be back for dinner and will have to check out brunch on your dog friendly patio :).

its a cute, locally owned coffee shop that popped up fairly recently in the chandler area. the space is pretty huge and apparently hosts local musical talent from time to time. i also noticed that they give free refills when you are drinking in house. definitely a place i'll continue to frequent. P.S. - they are dog friendly too!

thought i'd try this place since its so near work but this is definitely the first and only time i'll go to Mika's. i ordered the gyro platter ($12.95) with fries and salad. at first glance this price is a little steep compared to other greek restaurants in the area ($8.95 or $9.95). with a drink my lunch came to about $16. a little high but i figured i'd give this place a shot.   i ordered to go and had to wait for about 20 min before my food was ready. i was a little disappointed to see the size of the portions (this is a $16 lunch meal...). getting this back to the office and digging in, i'm equally saddened by the just average taste. the fries are not salted or crispy, the salad is bland, and the meat ... well it was definitely not plentiful and definitely not seasoned enough.  all in all a really disappointing experience. YC's or jimmy john's will be getting my business when i turn into that plaza.

i went here with a couple of girlfriends for a 'girls night' dinner. solid place for a date night dinner. the ambiance is loungy and relaxing, lowly lit, and comfy. it is also the kind of place that you take someone that you want to impress but not have to drop too much cash like you would at other "new american" restaurants in the area.   i liked the entree options (ribs, scallops, tuna, and quite a few pork dishes) and also was intrigued by the cocktail selection. looks like they have a lot of unique cocktails that would be great to try. i had the tuna and it was prepared perfectly medium rare. i loved the avocado tzatziki that came with it. it was light and airy but had a lot of flavor. i only wish there was more of it on the plate.  i think the service was the only less than stellar thing at this place. while our waiter was nice, he wasn't really all that attentive and only came back once to refill drinks/take drink orders. we also wanted to check out dessert but unfortunately he forgot to bring the dessert menu and just brought us our check.  it was busy even on a Monday so i would definitely get reservations if you'd like to check this place out. i may be back for a little happy hour cocktail exploration but not too sure about a full dining experience again.

had a fantastic time here with another couple. they had been here another time and had vouched for the food/drinks.  loved the atmosphere and the great outdoor area that housed all sorts of birds and vegetation. it was really relaxed and comfy. staff was extremely friendly and even though our wait for a table was 35 minutes, we passed the time chatting at the bar and getting great service from the bartenders.  food was pretty good. check out the sweet potato tots (love them) and their burgers. the salads also looked pretty good and were served in large portions.  definitely going to come back here to try some other things and maybe hit it up during happy hour to see if service is still great and to try some of their specialty drinks.  really a great place in chandler and nice to see something new and exciting in the area!
