well i stick to 4 stars for lunch all though that was my 1st time but the wife and i went for  breakfast last sunday morn. after the traditional being ignored for the first 8 minutes( BECAUSE WERE A NEW YORK STYLED DELI AND THATS THE WAY THEY DO IT IN NEW YORK) we sat down at a nice sized comfy booth our server a very nice older gal came and took our order cornbeef hash/breakfast burrito for the wife the cbh was fair (black bear diner has better and thats sad) burrito ok not great . there was 1 employ maybe a owner behind the counter defenitly from ny.........who cares .....sneezing, blowing his nose and then continuing to make the deli tray he was working on w/out washin his hands oh and then rubbing his nose with his finger as well lucky our meals were coming out of the kitchen and not from the front of the house where the 45 yo child does'nt know he needs to wash his hands when he blows his nose and is working w/food

ok  it is a ok (3stars) but just because the staff is fantastic and the food is very good and my waitress was a cutie I will step up to the plate(no pun intended) and give this hidden gem 4 stars. hidden in an  industrial area in phx this establishment is clean and the outdoor area is well maintained.

i saw 4 1/2 stars on this restaurant  so instead of going to my neighbor hood sushi restaurant  with yaki soba on my mind i decided to try this place i showed up at 1130 a m  i was the only person there, when i walked in the owner handed me a menu i went to a table and had a seat i went over the menu 3 or 4 times he sorta asked me if i was ready to order from behind the front desk i guess he did not wat to walk to my table to take my order  i asked him if he had yaki soba  he said no and left it at that so i ordered the lunch special w/chicken katsu the piece of chicken was maybe 3 oz piece 5/6 tempura battered vege a shrimp and a pot sticker and a small salad  6.50  he brought it to my table and left and returned to the back of the restaurant when i finished i went to the front desk he seamed ancious to cash me out but i ordered a side of pot stickers he brought those out and set them on the table ,as my glass of water was empty he never offered to re fill it  it is now noon and the place is still empty NOT A SOUL hmmmm I finished the pot stickers which were weak at best went and paid a rediculous 12.00$ oh all right 11 and change  never the less i left no tip.....you think  boy is this person really in the restaurant business?????????????????????

Dear best buy you made my trying to buy my mac book air a real pain in the ass. After 5 attempts by phone with the automated answering system telling me how important my business is to them 50 times and no one picking up the phone to finally getting a semi live person that puts me on hold and never returns to almost completing the transaction and then the clerk telling me they can't look up my account # so I have to call my wife to get the # and call again to start the process over. Oh and when you pick the item up a drivers lic. Isn't good enough u need the bb cc that you used as well.  Whew I was worn out from the process.

the question is would i go back and i must say i would we just had a few apps and a salad half order of  calamari done in the usuall deep fried manner it  was good and had a little spicey bite to them we also had the full order od mussels and a great salad with grilled eggpland a nutty coatted and fried piece of goat cheese kalamata olives ect bread was served warm with a herb mixure on a plate ...just add olive oil ....oh and of course i had to try the meatballs as i always say mine are better but these werent bad the martinis are fair but very reasonably priced 6.50 and we had a pitcher of wine the monteplacino de abruzza a nice house wine....and our server was pleasant and attentive as was the rest of the staff i wanted to give 3 stars but if you add all the components together for a busy saturday nite things were well done :)

went  this morning for breakfast the woman who was there looked at us like.....how did you get in here, not the most friendly reception (she did not speak english so when i tried to order a side i got the blank stare) after giving us the death stare she turned and walked away usually I would tend to walk out but I have had this place on my list to try for awhile.after we took a seat she brought us menus there are only 5/6 breakfast to choose from I had the scramble w/blk beans and plantains the plantains were o.k. but i have had much better much to greesy, wife had shredded beef w/scrammble she said it was good i thought the beef was dry, all and all it was a decent breakfast but not inexpensive for what you get. will not go back for breakfast but will defenetly go try lunch or dinner

Sorry Joe today was a huge disappointment I took our friends from pennsylvania here today for breakfast telling them how great your establishment is we went and ordered and had a seat our breakfast came in a reasonable amount of time ,unfortunately to start with I ordered the sausage gravy and got the two turkey sausages not a big deal ,but my guests egg were barley warm so she sent them back to be rewarmed as they took her eggs I took a bite of my eggs to find them the same as well as the potatoes so when the wait person returned with the rewarmed and now a bit dry eggs I sent my breAkfast  back and waited a good 5minutes for my breakfast to return put down in front of me and watched the waitress scoot away briskly just to find the eggs and potatoes still the same temp as when I sent them back and now the sausage gravy she brought me earlier had cooled down  the guy next to us was going through the same issues after he sent his dish back he got up about 7or 8minutes later to go find where his breakfast had disappeared to.      wow. It was a tough day at the liberty market as you can tell from my earlier reviews your restaurant has always been in our top breakfast places hopefully you can relay this issue to your staff .......ps we never saw our wait person again to check in with us to make sure we were now satisfied with our meals

I go here when i am working and want to get away from the work place enviroment. It is like a diner out of the early 70s and most of its breakfast/lunch/diners are priced like that as well the salads are great you may find caned fruit w/your salad but it works, the chili is very good meatloaf w mash potatoe and a caned veg... oh well when its on special its 4.95 and a great portion, lots of seniors.....but of course....they don't bite if you want a great budget meal this is a great spot.......oh and a friendly staff

well I must say i have taken a star away from anitas and can barley muster up 2 stars we were up in wickenburg for the marty stuart show on friday we decided to go to anitas for dinner before the show we were seated right away and brought chips and salsa then waited about 5 min before our very friendly server arrived . I ordered a margarita which was way too sweet must have been margarita mix, i had the 6 rolled taquitos w/beef and guac and sour cream $9.50  I thought a little pricey ...WHERES THE BEEF, the wife had a taco salad which had lettuce chicken and cheese....no tomatos/beans The menu was also very limited this week end was gold miner days so i think the menu might have been catered to that over charge and limited menu.As we talked to some of the locals no one talked very highly of this place and said   IT USE TO BE GOOD

this store has gotten better with there produce but still has a long way to go for me to shop here over our locale frys the great thing about this store is so few people go here that its easy getting in and out if you need some basic food items. the paking lot has shopping carts all over the place because people seem to be very lazy and none caring where they leave there carts none the less for a none busy store there staff does not seem to manage this issue. i think they need to rethink who there customer coud be and not assume its the ageing retirement communitys and focus on people who are looking for better quality product

I thought should i even review this place? but the loving public needs to know I hit the drive thru window after a long day at work(are'nt they all) I ordered the 8 pc w/ the usuall sides in this case mash potatos w /gravy mmmmmmm gravy /coleslaw when i got home  I opened  the bucket ,at the bottom of the bucket were 8 sad pieces of chicken the 2wings and 3legs looked like they were from a piegon based on there size 2 small breast  and 1 thigh .......and i guess i got the new grilled chicken not the original or xtra crispy not that i was asked .....it was'nt terrible but for 18bucks I think i could have gone to albertsons and got better looking chicken w all the sides for alot less.

wife and I went sunday for breakfast, Not that i have ever been to iowa but this place feels like right out of the corn fields the interior is what i would call early american country,the staff is very nice,i ordered the creole scramble I asked about the creole sauce that goes on the dish all she said was that it was good,and asked me how i would like my eggs(i thought it was a scramle) it turned out to taste very much like marinara sauce when i recived the dish i removed the glob of cheese looking for my eggs which i ordered poach...........hmmm no eggs i called the waitress over and asked ,she promply went to the kitchen and retrived them My wife had a couple of eggs and 2 bacon which was burnt at one end and not cooked at the other..........how do you do that........my dish wasnt to bad but i am not a fan of marinara/creole sauce with breakfast

We decided to try vitos the other nite based on reviews and word of mouth so i went to there web site to check out the menu i noticed they delivered and it was 15% off for first delivery....perfect , so i ordered on line with a  delivery time noted as we got close to the delivery time i called to let them know that there was a gate code to get in she said i will call the driver to let him know....perferct, so came the delivery time...plus 10 minutes........plus 10 more minutes.......plus 10 more minutes......so i called back to find out where the order was....she said   oh were sorry we thought it was for pick up....WHAT THE HELL so i can't tell you how the food is BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT ANY. ended up going else where. A return phone call from mngt or owner might have been nice.

well after the last disaster with trying to have a pizza delivered we decided to try this place again and picked the pizza up all i can say is the pizza really had no flavor i salted i peppered i chili flaked and those are not dance steps. I guess we have given this establishment the opportunity to be our neighborhood place but i Know I can make a better pizza at home all though i have added a star to there rating just for actually getting the order right

went to try this place based on one review on yelp  the waitress was rough around the edges in her waitress/hostess roll the place smelled like one of those old town restaurants that people probley smoked in for years combined with greese that may not get changed as much as it should. as the waitress cleared tables there was alot of crashing of dishes in the dirty dish bin. I must say i sliped out before ordering food may be good if lucky ........

After looking for this restaurant for 20 minutes and calling for directions twice we finally located this establishment basically its next to jewel of the crown Indian restaurant . We met some friends there for breakfast the good part of this experience was the veggie hash I had was good all though I ordered it with two poached eggs  which came hard as rocks I think all in all the food was good but it took a good 45 minutes to get it and our friend couldn't seem to get a coffee refill the whole time we waited even though the other waitperson was with in steps I flagged her over but she would not go out of her section to fill the cup .

well gabi you said it they are SLOW and i don't think the sandwiches are that great plus all the employs seam to have this attitude that your taking up there time like they have something else to do there product selection of Italian goodies seems pretty good but way over priced the one thing they have that i really like is there feta cheese which i use in my spanokopita the other day when i stopped in for feta i decided to get a sandwich... meatball,I said to the guy can i get an xtra meatball on the sandwich .......guy.....snotty....you can get whatever u want ,oh OK f u then i went to the front counter i told the guy there i would like a pound of feta he kinda shook his head in disgust i guess because there were 5 people behind me waiting to order food to go and i had the gull to order feta so he yelled behind the window CAN SOMEBODY GET ME A LB OF FETA FOR THIS GUY OUT HERE .......f u.......I will think twice before i give this establishment any money again

The food is ok ,not a great selection ,service is friendly but not very attentive all of our dim sum was stuck to the bottom of the metal container so they fell apart as we tried to remove them we had to flag an employ down for more ice tea I guess slurping my glass was not enough of a clue ...............will I be back .............NO

We actually ventured into town searching for a new and exciting dining experience and we're delighted by ticoz  our wait person was professional  and efficient, I had the Mexican Benedict which I found delectable my wife had the huevous rancheros which was also very good the only thing was the eggs were not done as my wife had requested when she brought it to our wait persons attention she did offer my wife a new egg but my wife said it was ok as is. I thought maybe a bit of a comp on our bill might have been a nice gesture none the less we will certainly return for more, oh did I mention 2.99 bloody Mary's

we went to the happyhour at tv the prices are defenitly swingin $1,$2 and $3 apps the calamari was decent with a wasabi type dipping sauce portions are small but for the price decent. the duck tidbits were dry and unexciting the asian ribs were a nice portion and decent the best tasting app was the burger spicy toped w/slaw  and a $11 hearts of iceberg salad off the reg menu a few $11 martinis which for the price could have been a little more of a generous pour and one fruity cocktail for the wife and bam a $70 dollar bill. The setting is quite nice service was very friendly but a littlte laxed for as quite as it was.lots of other better places in the valley to go for cocktail hour

what i hav'nt reviewed this place yet wtf great decor,service,food we live in ne mesa and trek the 30 miles or so to have breakfast here on sundays kevin the owner is almost always here he runs a tight ship and always greets us with a big hello.I will say it is one of the  great pubs/restaurants in phx.

As i have stated before this is a great well run establishment, Kevin the owner is my kind of business man ,friendly, runs a tight ship,wait staff are knowledgeable and polite can take a little razzing and have fun with it and he (kevin) thanks you for your business! in my book very important in todays world. if i'm in your place of business i appreciate that aspect. NOW down to food the tasso ham and carmilized  onion tortilla is excellent with melted cheese, diablo wings mmmm spinich dip good and calimari yummy as well that was last nights selection with friends.happy hour 3-630 and fab brunche on the weekends

As usual these people go above and beyond today we showed up 20 minutes before they opened and took a chair outside to wait for opening the very delightful wait person came out side to greet us, I said I know your not open yet we'll just wait out here until your ready, he said no problem were ready do you want to dine here or inside ? We chose inside and we were seated at our fave corner table. This place rocks Great job guys

I  had the seafood risotto lots of shrimp,scallops, mussells and served piping hot the wife had the nichious salad w/beautifully done tuna a great bottle  bottle of wine .

This was our second visit since my last epiphany with this place, started the evening outside with other patrons and then the rain gods opened up and all the desert rats ran for cover inside every one was nicely accomadated and the evening went on great music ,food and service. our waiter was good but i tried to get his attention and could not the owner or manager saw me and immediately came to see what I needed.a pleasant dining experience

once again my 3rd and final review got home later from work than i wanted to so we decided to hit dvine for a nice meal and the usuall relaxing musician who has played there when ever we have gone to devine. as we pulled into the parking lot I noticed alot of cars we entered the restaurant and it was packed.There was another group playing last night who apparently has quite a fan base good music but a tad loud for my taste and the venue,after a short wait we were seated and greated by many pleasant employs service was swift and attentive I had the surf and turf which was a beef short rib served atop nochi and a piece of grouper served atop steamed greens wife had rack of lamb atop goat cheese mashed potatoes along with a little to much wine both great bottles this is a great ne mesa establishment

we had breakfast here yesterday the service was good ,the place it self is old school decor early american  and could use a good cleaning, I had two eggs over medium w/hashbrowns that really had no umpf  Im not sure if they were from a bag but i have a feeling they were and a slice of bone in ham the size of texas ......delicious my wife had two eggs over soft and when they came they were over HARD ???? the wait person apoligized and brought her 2 eggs over soft in a timley fashion.greeks are usually known for running great breakfast joints but this bunch have been catering to the old school mesa crowd to long.

I must say I step foot in a wal mart  maybe 3 times a year I am not a big fan of the way they do not provide a med/dental plan for there employs which are not the most top notch help in a store not that i blame them ..............anyway I bought a floor fan from them 2 months ago and the other day it stoped working so i took it back to the locale i bought it and took it to the return dept this is a 38$ fan. the person asked if i had a recipt of course i did not save it but i said i have the credit card i used she informed me they cannot look it up that way thus the adventure begains she tried to look it up in a differant manner and said she would need the exact date and which terminal i was checked out in...............................I dont know i said i think it was one of these over there then 10 more min went by and then she said if I go get the upc then she could try to look it up that way so off i went to try to find the upc # another 10 min. she did actually find the transaction but said she could only give me a walmrt giftcard after 30 min i got my lousy 38 bucks back as i watch them give a little old lady greif about her return because the upc did'nt match her recipt and all she wanted was an x change these employs i am sure under the thumb of big brother but the act like it is there money. bottom line NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NEVER TO SHOP AT A WAL MART AGAIN all because of a 38$fan wal mart     WAKE UP

i love the qc olive oil but after a huge build up of what fab food  del piero has  we were very disapointed with the breakfast i had the dpiero eggs benidict served on foccicia bread there was very little bit of very thinly sliced ham the eggs are served like a fratata and nothing seamed to well seasoned with roasted potatoes the wife had a sausage and egg w/assagio cheese also served on foccicia and ordered fruit side with hers which was slices of oranges. I guess the manager or owner ???decided to have a 15 min meeting with his staff right by where we were sitting and had to listenin to the inner working of business politics and scheduling not a fab experience

yes i must agree w/my fellow yelpers i understand they are under new mngt so i thought i would give them another opportunity so i poped in and right when i walked in the door i heard a yell from the back of the store ....I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU SIR........which was at least an acknowledgment i was there un like my first visit a year ago when i walked around in the store while the staffed argued with each other never the less i was there a 1/2 hr and the only employ was with the same guy she was with when i walked in and there were two people in front of me so i said x*%& this and left

Went there this morning I had a waffle which was good it also came with two smallish turkey sausages which were cold the waitress was right there so she hurried them back to the kitchen and returned  in a moments time with the warmed sausages in the mean time when I took a bite of my eggs they were also ......we will say not hot by any means and not over medium like I requested  my wife had one of there scrambles with potatoes bacon onion which she said she liked it said it came smothered in gravy but it was not smothered  and  in her case she said she preferred it as is ...I have always liked there lox,bagel,tomato,ect if and when I return that is what I will stick with they seam to have that dish down

i will say right off the food is decent,prices fair,service below average. i have been there 3 times twice for lunch once for dinner, I ordered a tanquery martini at dinner and the server said and i quote..I have no idea what that is?...............OK ........the one time i had been ther for lunch there was a staff of 5/6 and I sat at the counter and they could not figure out who was going to take my order or wait on me the third time I had a waitless toss a menu my direction and tried to crack a smile then another woman waited on me she was actually nice but when the cook brought my food out i never saw her again untill i was finished and she droped my check off lunch was good i did have to hunt down my own salt and pepper total bill 6.95ish I put a 20$ bill in w/the check and crack lady said rudley to nice lady ....THE GUY AT THE BAR NEEDS CHANGE..................nice............. the owner is always there when i have been there for lunch but seems to be numb to his business

last nites dining extravaganza had its high points pan seared foisgra with a few pieces of duck breast ...fantastic tuna tartar with a jalapeno lime puree excellent  then i ordered the bouillabaisse seamed more like a tomato soup with seafood the first mussel i bit tasted a little funky the next one was better but i was not enamored with the dish the wife swap ed dishes with me she had the sea bass very good served on  a bed of pasta .john our server was a solid 4 stars he did offer to bring me another dish since i was not smitten with the bouillabaisse which is a quality gesture.

Under new ownership? Great I thought....Well the same loud crappy music was blasting and the big screen TVs were playing. I actually like the inside of this place, but the loud music and big TVs don't fit. The food isn't bad, not cheap, but not bad. I just can't get over the fact that the music is to loud and not very good and the service is poor. Have you ever considered jazz and a pop alternative? The average age of the clientele looked to be over 30, no twenty somethings in sight. If the bartender tells me one more time (3 in the twenty minutes I waited) that my to go order will be right up I may have to smack her. Just kidding non violent, but jeez give me a break, I'm tired its late and I just want to go home and have dinner!

my first visit i must say was an enjoyable experience the front house staff  was friendly we went to sit in the bar but the stools at the high top looked uncomfortable so we decided to sit in the restaurant. we went all small plate selections crab balls very good chicken and mushrooms lettuce  wraps, mini corn dog tasty and sausage and cheese flat bread boring could defiantly have a little more pizazz , and best dish was our cute little gal wait person friendly smiling and a snappy server, i forgot her name damn it

I'm sorry m and s i was told how fab your happy hour was and i must say its not that great ok a burger for 295 sounds pretty good although i had the sliders 2 sliders w/fries 395 not bad i ordered 6 oyster off the reg menu 13$ the bar tender was not familiar with what kind of oysters came from where but did ask someone who new the oysters were good service was friendly but not that attentive to busy talking to each other my martinis were good...not great ...10$ each which is a fair price in scottsdale world all in all i dont think i'll ever have to visit again 2 stars is harsh but 3 is to many

The wife and I ate here about a year ago and thought it was decent for the price.this is not a place or venue we may normally choose for dining but once in a while mediocre comfort food hits  the spot.Last nights dining experience was less than stellar,most the dishes they offered were not good at all flavor wise I ended up having a baker and a steak which the FOUR guys working the steak station were more intrested in standing in a huddle talking and joking and when i finnally got one of there attention he seamed a little put out that I wanted  a steak.............salad bar was decent ,service was good may be a long time before and if we go back

There's nothing terrible about this restaurant, the food is tasty most entrees were covered heavily in cheese (not my thing) the perfect storm margarita $7.50 or so was quite tasty my pork tacos meat was dry my wife had a stuffed chile relleno (smotherd in cheese) once she removed the glob of cheese the chile was tasty the salsa tasted like picante sauce out of a jar service was good when our waiter brought us our check he had written have a blessed night.........WHAT.........i dont mix religion and drinking.......... to many really good mex restaurants in az to dine at a americanized version.........ps this was the new mesa location

This was not my first choice as i looked to yelp to find a in city mexican restaurant to take my friend visitig from seattle to but it was one of the few opened on monday . My next visit it will be the first place i choose this place rocks Great food and prices a great wait person who found out it was our first visit and gave us the skinny on all the dishes and be sure to ask for the salsa's, excellent guac, tuna tacos and pork tacos they also serve breakfast next on the agenda

In todays tight economy I really hate to speak ill  of a restaurant unless they deserve it this place does not... really.... BUT I was the only patron in the restaurant and had to get my own salt and pepper and i sat without a water refill as i ate my dinner untill i was almost finnished on the high note the baba ganoush was fair  at a  decent price  the salad was quite good fresh and crisp and the kafta kabob was dry should have had some tazeki with it to help moisten the meat . the lady/waitperson/maybe owner was nice enough but not overly intrested in making sure I had what i needed as I ate my dinner 3 stars is kinda pushin it .......the real question is would i go back?????   we'll see they did have some lunch specials 11am 3pm

i decided to give this place a second try i went to one of there stores right after they opened and was not impressed.finding good seafood in az is always a chalenge so i thought that f&e might be worth a try again but i was saddley mistaken on the shelf sat a few lonley packs of sea scallops and some  shrimp alot of hamburger and a few highly overpriced packs of lamb and a sh&^%t load of chicken. they seam to have alot of prepared food for people on the go or dont cook i think sprouts is a much better option

my wife and i ate at the chandler locale once because of all the great reviews are love for the food was not there and the cocky wait person wanna be hippy child also left us wondering what was so fab about this place......now i know this review is about the sd location in the mall and it happens to be convient to hit now and then but every time i finish eating a meal ther i wonder why ......I have tried salads, hummus which is flavorless, gyros ....the chicken they serve is xtreamly dry as well

i went here for lunch last week,after reviewing the menu i decided on the meatloaf sandwich may be i didnt read the discription but what i got was a open face sandwich the piece of loaf wasnt big enough to cover the bread and was a thin piece as well. the price was stiff for the portion served. beer selection fair service decent. i may return to try wings but at this point not high on my list

Went here for lunch today it was the most awkward uncomfortable lunch I have had I walk in sat at the bar the ??? Owner gave me a cold hello and walked back into the kitchen then I sat there for 4/5 minutes when the waitperson showed up gave me a fairly friendly hello although the service deteriorated from there ????? I showered brushed my teeth comb my hair  i ordered the wings and asked if I could split the flavors she said it must be 50/50 ok I can deal with that .......she came back out to inform me they had NO WINGS AT ALL...........serious.....so I ordered there 5 dollar burger and asked for it medium and got it basically well done I'm not even sure it was the burg I ordered but I really just wanted to eat and leave at this point she never asked me how any thing was and when she took my check for 18 dollars with a 20 dollar bill she brought me my change and never said a thing .....like thank you or thanks for coming in or ...........ok here's one thing they had a good selection of beer on tap ...... Fat Willy's you are off my list of places to go

Being disappointed with d vine the last few times we decided to give cafe boa a whirl we sat at the bar due to supposedly no tables available when we chose a couple of seats to sit at, the bar tender immediately asked us to take two other seats next to another couple being he had other reservations coming for the bar  which was a little white lye because he said that to all the bar customers ...his way of controlling his domain  to me he was a little arrogant and a show off to his new young girl employ we ordered the cheese and meat platter with four different options the big push was that every thing was made in house although he was pushing the prosciutto which I said oh you do that in house he said no they get it out of Idaho :/ oh but then mr cocky was wrong then we finally found out it was from Parma  ok good but i have had this 1000000 times he also was talking  how fab the cheese port salute was and we should try it ......ok kid this is not my first dinner out port salute trader joes yes it is good but I have had it as well as I sucked my martinis he did become more tolerable  we did end up with the in house made chorizo a couple of nice cheeses and yes in house pate which was very good we split a beat salad the mussels  I also ordered the open face lasagna but by the time it got to us I was full so we ended bringing it home I will say by the end of the night we had an enjoyable experience and I got use to mr cocky who all and all was a good  wait/bartender

The service here is good but I feel the prices are a bit stiff I usually go for lunch if I have a hankering for Japanese food because I work close and I have ordered the bento box each time because it is priced in a reasonable range unfortunately there is not much to it and the main dish in this case chicken has been over cooked and even in the sauce is dry this lunch with tip was around 12 dollars

Only slightly frightened when I walked in the gal came out of the back and seemed to have a coughing fit which concerned me a little or maybe a lot  but when the pollo taco and tostada arrived they looked and were muy bueno and the mama brought me some deep chile red hot sauce that warmed my heart and maybe other places still to early to tell.

This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant the food is excellent and the service is as well!

After years of using the superstition springs Lexus dealer ship I decided to use Rory's. The estimate I got from the dealer ship was considerably more expensive than Jon at Rory's quoted me. I needed a lift to work after dropping my car at Rory's, Rory himself was kind enough to give me a lift to work as well as pick me up.The service was certainly 5+ star as well as the quotes and work that needed to be done. They work on most makes and models and have all kind of cool cars in there garage

gave this place a whirl yesterday the menu is fairly standard SPORTS BAR oriented i had the build your own flat bread with prosciutto, mushrooms ,mozzarella cheese onions with a olive oil and garlic base .It was OK i had to season it up didn't seem to have alot of flavor and micro pieces of prosciutto  ,a work pal joined me later and ordered a burger med rare when it arrived it was well done and serverd on a cold bun. he sent it back and received a second burger to his liking and they did comp his meal........hey what about me well i paid the 13 bucks plus tip but not really any reason to go back as far as I'm concerned . interior nice server was good and friendly and of course sports bar loud .

I appreciate when a restauranter ventures to the restaurant waist land of ne mesa to give us a chance to enjoy a better selection of grub. I have been here 4 times now and have experienced a good breakfast with mediocre service to great service and medicore food yester day i had the  wolfpack hashbrowns with 2 eggs and bacon covered with more hashbrowns i requested eggs poached med. they came more to the hard side when one of the employs asked me how my eggs were i said there more to the hard side ,she said   O and walked away  I then asked for a side of holindaise my wait person brought it to me ......cold ....i said can you heat this she of course said no problem .....brought it back an over micro waved sauce that now looked like cottage cheese sent to my table by the (chef???) and delivered by the waitperson  didnt either one of them think lets redo this and not serve a coagulated mess to the customer. i must say the 4 times iv been here theres always been something not quite right from not having change for a $20 to waiting to long for my food  and yesterdays holindaise debacle.

Ok breakfast not so much my toast must have been toasted and then sat for twenty minutes while they made my breakfast the home fries are cut up French fries I ordered the skillet with peppers onions and sausage when it came out 20 plus minutes later not overly hot  no eggs I guess it doesn't come with eggs. My wife had the egg sandwich which she said was ok when it was time to pay I gave the server 20 dollar bill on a 16 dollar tab she said thank you and never came back with my change so I could decide on the tip it would have probley been 2 dollars not 4$ ....... Consistency people like I said in my last review good wings beer and salad, breakfast  jury's still out
