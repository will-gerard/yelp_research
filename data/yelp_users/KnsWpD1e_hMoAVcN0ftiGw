RUDE RUDE STAFF!  Something definitely needs to be done about this, I have never met such rude staff in my life. The people who shop here are definitely rude as well. When they first opened a while back in Chandler, the place was very clean, and I was in awe. Over time it seems like the place fell into further disrepair, the "entrance" set of Automatic Doors broke, so instead of fixing it like every other store would do, they blocked it off and forced all of us to use the exit door as a "Two way traffic door"....of course, without people saying excuse me, or anything, they just WALK RIGHT INTO YOU, as if YOU DON'T EXIST!  They also seem to lack an "IC3" policy that most stores use, which means, that if there are three or more customers in a line, they should CONSIDER opening up another check stand so we can get on with our lives! Unfortunately, what I usually see is that they open about 3 checkstands or so, and the line is so long, expect to spend a long time standing in line.   The staff at the meat counter actually seems nice, they wave hi as you walk past, and know the very basics of customer service...serving the customer. I can not say the same for any of the floor staff (or lack thereof), or cashiers at all!   I can say I only come here because it is close to home here in Chandler, but for a better experience, I go up to Mekong supermarket in Mesa, on Main & Dobson near the Light Rail station.  Also, peculiar that I do not have the same issues with the Lee Lee's up in Peoria. For some reason, the Chandler location just feels like something isn't right.  Also if you think you can kill two birds with one stone by buying your "American" groceries, along with your "asian" groceries, think again. Their "American" groceries prices are marked up almost 200% that of a normal grocery store!

you guys need an inventory control system. every other store can look up an item, and tell me where the item is! i don't know is never an acceptable answer to a customer!

The comedian was funny. The venue was horrible! Let's see where do I start?  Prices- no I don't mind the ticket prices, it's normal, it's not expensive for getting to see your favorite comedians and for a laugh. I'm talking about the hidden fees, such as the 15% already included tip, and the $20 seating fee, what's with that? $13 for a Sprite/Coke, $6 for a bottle of water. There is a strict 2 drink minimum, and she exclaimed "but they don't have to be alcoholic" - she left out the fact they charge an arm and a leg for ANY drink, alcohol or not.   Seating configuration- was a little cramped that I like. It felt like we were shoved into a corner, because we were!  Service- so we got our buzzer, and then they kicked is out and told us to wait for the buzzer. We were not even allowed to wait in the lobby while other people in our party were using the restroom. While inside we ordered our drinks, and then when we wanted to order some food, the waitress just never came back to our table. When she did, it always was interrupting what we were trying to hear from the comedian! It's not like you can ask the comedian to repeat what he was saying! Then they don't act like they have to give you good service because they do get an automatic 15% tip anyway.   Food- we didn't eat here because they never came back to take our food order! Not like I want a $12 bag of chips anyway I guess.   Also, because of where it was located, it is really hard to walk in the lobby, because of the tight cramped places.

Food is good. But it is 2016. Places are getting Apple Pay, Chip Credit Card readers and more. And yet this place still wants to be cash only. Ok no problem, there is an ATM on site, it just charges you $5 to get your money! I guess it made sense when you were the only Asian sandwich place around, because when you don't have competition, you get to make all the rules. But now with competition from Mekong sandwiches etc, you guys need to step your game up.   Two stars for this reason alone, while I schlep my way to Mekong sandwiches up the road, they take credit cards, and offer fast service. Oh and it doesn't feel like you're at the DMV

Removed the Yelp sign from the front door? Something feels fishy about that...It is almost like they know something is up with the reviews on here.  Anyways, The food generally is pretty good, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU ORDER, and be careful how you word it, because YOU ARE GOING TO GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASK FOR.  Stick to the menu, and order based on the pictures, don't try to deviate. If you deviate, they will take EVERYTHING in the literal sense.   The DIM SUM is YUM, and definitely worth making a stop here before 3 to catch it. I also attended a wedding that was held here, and all the food was delicious. As long as you don't deviate from the standard offerings on the menu, this place is definitely one of the best in Chandler, and maybe Arizona.

Definitely like others said, try the breakfast burrito! They are definitely worth it, they are huge and can fill you up. Looks can be deceiving, because they look small on the menu board, and they will look small when you get it. You may order two because you feel hungry, but trust me, you will barely be able to finish HALF of one! They are very fulfilling at all times of day, especially when you're  just looking for something quick and cheap.  The minute you order, they will immediately begin cooking your order in the back, which means, yes, there will be a little bit of a wait. But the wait is worth it.   OTHER THINGS I RECOMMEND  YOU TRY OUT:   Rolled Tacos- DELICIOUS Nachos Carne Asada w/ beans!

NEEDS A CUSTOMER FACING DISPLAY FOR THEIR POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. The staff here is WONDERFUL, and the OWNER IS ALWAYS HERE, yes that's right, if you come here often, you have the pleasure of meeting Lenny himself.  But one major flaw is that they need a display on their point of sale system showing you what you have ordered before you pay (just like their Glendale location), because I have had my order messed up more than quite a few times here, usually they forget my extra french fries, or place everything in the world on my cheese burger, when I only wanted the cheese, meat, and bun.  Other than that, I don't really have anything negative to say about this place. I love the staff, and if the right person is at the register, they remember my order and the negative points I have made above is negated.

Wonderful little place I found. I have tried the Chicken hotdog, and it was the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. The prices are cheap, and you just can't seem to beat the customer service! Just because the prices are cheap, it doesn't mean it is low quality food, this WAS the best hot dog I have ever had, and I am glad to say I am definitely going to be a repeat customer.  Willy talks to all of his customers, and will even sit down at the table with you when it's not busy.   Make sure you sign up for the rewards card program, on that iPad that is facing you, you can gain points, and get free stuff!   Also, an off note, you can pay here with your phone if you have the Square Wallet app for your iPhone, I think that is pretty cool! You just say your name and pay, no cards, or cash needed!  Definitely a repeat customer here! I don't think you can find a better Hot Dog anywhere else in Chandler!

Came here with my girlfriend and actually had a great time. The staff was friendly, and it has a fun atmosphere. The patio however is small, and crowded. Everyone seems to push and shove their way to this patio to be able to get a bit of nice cold Phoenix weather in the winter. Music was loud and the DJ Was good. There was a $5 cover charge which was BS. Also watch out for the minimum $10 purchase with your card.   I didn't use the bathrooms here to be able to base my review on that like others on here did. But I don't see why people would review and judge a place based on what kind of bathroom it has.

They actually take Apple Pay! Two major caveats though, they charge you 35 cents to use it, and it must be a debit card! You can use Apple Pay, as long as it is a debit card, and you key in your PIN for the purchase. Also, Apple Pay will only work inside the store, not at the pump.  They also installed GSTV on the gas pumps, so you actually can watch TV while you're filling up. A nice concept too, and a few stations around Arizona has installed this system, not only does it show you TV while you're getting gas, but the whole transaction process of using Pay at Pump has improved a lot, thanks to the fact that GSTV requires a huge color screen. No more squinting at a barely readable black and white screen.

Walmart? More like SMALL-Mart  However despite how small the Walmart is, I got everything I needed, and it is small, but then again before you complain look at everything else in the area, it is also small. You can't expect them to shoehorn a full size store in a lot this small, even Walmart haven't figured out how to break the laws of physics yet.   I got everything I needed at this store and I think the staff here was very nice. Parking was alright for the time I went and I did have a pleasant shopping experience here.

Bought my 11" MacBook Air in pristine condition here. Saw a couple TVs I may want to purchase in the near future and they do have a nice store going on with knowledgable staff.   They do have very reasonable prices on everything in the store from what I can see, and I'll definitely be referring friends to this place.  If you're looking for bottom of the barrel prices, look elsewhere, because you do get what you pay for. What you get are quality products at a fair price that won't break the bank, and they back it with a 90 day warranty.   Only negative was the semi truck blocking access to the rest of the parking, obviously this was only temporary.   Will definitely be back.

Service was ok, but I'm sorry your men's bathroom stall needs DOORS! How in the world is it ok to not put one if you're taking a number 2? This can't even be legal!

Still no door on that toilet stall in the men's room? Sorry but people do like to poop in privacy. I'd hate this to be the reason why I am down rating this bar, but you'd think it'd be more of a priority for them to fix something as simple as a bathroom stall door. If you don't want to fix this, add a lock to the main door.

They have new hours! Chinese authentic food at 11PM? Count me in!!!   I love the duck and pork combo. It was delicious. And the new hours pretty much make it the only restaurant in Phoenix where I can get Chinese food late enough due to work :).

OK, Where do I start?  This place is AMAZING! I love the food here, especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time! Forget about the movie theater popcorn, you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie!  Before the movie starts, a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order, usually during the previews. During the movie, you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order. About nearing the end of the movie, you will get your check, so make sure that if you want more food, get your orders in before the movie is over.  Pricing is good, it costs about the same as  a dinner and a movie separately, why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once? The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE, as long as you get the love seat, or leather seats, just don't get the "office chair" seats, as those are like....sitting in an office chair for 3 hours watching a movie ;).

Chicken came out stale, food took too long, and the service was slow. Our waitress didn't tend to our needs, never came to check up on us for refills etc. the garlic knots were literally burnt.   Our wings were harder than a rock, the potato salad was horrible and tasted just wrong.   They had a band who did nothing but sing one song, then proceeded to take a 10 minute break, sang another song, then took another 10 minute break, etc.  The Band is better than the Food!  Do not come here, never again! Horrendous prices for what you get as well. If they probably lowered the prices, then maybe the food would be.....passable.

When the owner dances with you and sings during karaoke, you know they have great customer service! Came here with my girlfriend and some friends on Saturday night to have some fun, and had a great time. Karaoke was great, and the people (customers) there were fun to be around.

It was a different kind of fare, but it was really good! My girlfriend ordered hers spicy (on a scale of 1-10, she ordered a 6, I was more conservative and ordered mine a 3).   Megan and I are on a "world food tour" and and this was Stop #2 on our list.   The place is kind of hidden from view, but it is located on Higley and Baseline, hidden right near the Fitness Works in the back of the complex somewhat. The place is VERY clean, and the lady who works there, seems like she is the owner, is VERY NICE! She was very courteous, and was very professional.   I do not know why others seemed like they had so much trouble with Groupon offers, I have used mine with no issues at all, in fact, she said that over 400 had purchased Groupons already, and her business has been doing a lot better thanks to it! She was very grateful that we came in, and she was very attentive to our needs in the restaurant.  Now indian food, isn't for everyone, it is kind of heavy, and strong, so be prepared. If you know what you're in for, it is really good. Our food wasn't cold either like others have stated, rather it was fresh, and hot right out of the kitchen, and very tasty. The Indian Chicken Soup is to die for, and is a great start to the meal.   The only part that is bad would be the fact that the food is kind of expensive, which thankfully we had the Groupon offer to help offset the cost. Without the Groupon, you would be looking at spending about upwards of $60 + Tip for a simple dinner for two.  I do recommend this place to anyone looking to try out a new place to eat, and it is definitely good food!

They have Apple Pay at this Arco too, however, you must use Apple Pay with a debit card, as this place is debit or cash only. I don't mind, as I don't usually get gas with my credit cards anyway.  I applaud and will frequent places that have installed Apple Pay/PayPass reading equipment. Congratulations on this one.

Disappointed. I am 25 and own a 2003 C240 Mercedes, I guess my Mercedes is too old to be looked at by the service department. I feel like they think I am not good enough to set foot in their dealership.   I called the service department multitudes of times to see if they can do the TeleAid upgrade for my Mercedes, and even Mercedes themselves told me to go to a dealership and it could get done easily.   The service guys have hung up on me, didn't even say goodbye and made me feel like less than a person when I inquired about getting this service done. I had another service rep just say "we don't do it" when Chandler Mercedes informed me all dealerships do this for a fee. I wasn't asking for free service. I was just asking for service.   Looks like Mercedes Benz of Scottsdale lost yet another customer to Chandler. The Chandler Mercedes guys treat me like I'm a human being, and you don't need to drive an S Class dressed up in $7,000 clothes from Neiman Marcus to get their attention!   The way you don't treat all your customers with respect means that I will buy my future cars from Chandler Mercedes now.

I'm writing this review from the perspective of an adult, mainly the food. I was doing some work across the street and was craving pizza. I found out that Makutus island served pizza. Found their number, gave them a call and placed an order for pick up.   The pizza was great and I like how the pepperonis actually had a slight crunchiness to them. The pizza here reminds me of a place called Fast Pizza in California, and that is probably why I like it so much.   The staff was very courteous and admission into the cafe is always free. Everyone who works here actually seem to be very nice and smiling all the time!   If I had kids I'd definitely take them here as that tree looks fun to climb through! I can say that the food is good and the kids looked like they were having a good time!
