This review is based on the pastry and the friendly service (Pierre is great) - not the food (yet)  If you have been to Paris, the taste of the pastries will take you back to the flavors and flair of that great city  I have been in to Au Petit Four a couple times, the first time everything looked so good I ended up with a tray of goods and got about 8 different items - that was a delicious day  Fast forward several months later and I stopped in again to pick up dessert for a bbq,  and the desserts were the hit of the event, the mille feuille and chocolate praline dessert were the two favorites, however everything is excellent  There is really no better spot to get in the greater Phoenix area to get pastry than here, I would highly recommend stopping in  As of this review I have not been in for food of a non sugar primary ingredient variety, however based on the pastry I would guess the food would follow suit

Pretty Average Pub Food here, with a normal boring beer list - nothing to really stand out at all -  The ribs are very average, with the cheesy potatoes being fine, if coming out a bit tepid  I would certainly not recommend it, based on this meal and looking at the menu I would guess if you do not have adventurous tastes and a bud light palate you will be happy here - If you are looking for something more than average American cuisine - move on

Unmitigated Disaster - We will never be back again, and I would have to recommend (after this experience) for no one to go there either.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple "I'm sorry for the wait" would have gone a long way.  There were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food.   We sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the evening  While waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room.   Finally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way).   My wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, "For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal." I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal.   While waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full.   Anyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, "Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints." Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!

Got the #13 Tom Yum soup, which was salty to almost unedible, with shrimp cooked to within an inch of their life, pretty poor example of this type of soup  The #54 Pad Thai was done reasonably well, however the menu states chicken and shrimp, there certainly was no shrimp in this dish it was just chicken, - Americanized but still tasty   Based on this trip I would probably not return

This review is based on ordering many things from the overall menu over a 1 year period, however one item there deserves a 5 star rating which I will get to  Overall most of the items are fairly americanized and not traditional which you expect from a fusion place - however most items are very average and for the price I do not feel you get good value here   That being said the one item that does stand out here is their Shrimp Tom Yum Soup which i feel deserves 4 if not 5 stars - it is excellent and flavorful, with a lot of shrimp - make sure to order a side of steamed rice with it medium hot, and you will have a stand out dish  In general their soups are solid, but the only thing I have not found better somewhere else is their Shrimp Tom Yum soup  Go for the Tom Yum, get your Vietnamese soup from Khai Hoan down the road a few miles

Ruth Chris, why does your food have to be so average and underwhelming  The restaurant is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio for drinks when it is nice out  If you go ask for Bruce, he is the best server that I can remember having for any restaurant - was exceptional and I dine out at many high end places  Having not been to a Ruth Chris in 4 or 5 years it was time to give it another shot, i remembered the food being very average and being underwhelmed by the steak, which was the case again - The steaks were cooked correctly, I feel their steaks are bland, especially compared to other chains like Masteros  The desserts were very good and the highlight for us, both the sin cake (very dark chocolatey) and the bread pudding with raisens  Won't be going back, however the location and the service are fantastic, so if you do enjoy Ruth Chris steaks, you will be happy here - go see Bruce and he will make sure you have a fantasic time, as we did, even though the food wasn't up to our level of expectation

Had the 2nd worst meal ever here, behind only Vincent's on Camelback (feel free to see my review of that place)  I wish I would have remembered the old chef left at the start of august  It started pretty poorly, then they started cooking which made things even worse  Walking in there was on one to greet us, we had to track down the hostess (not a big deal but a minor quibble, with the pricing they have that is something that should never happen)  They ran out of the tasting menu at 8PM on a Saturday on the holiday weekend, as well as they running out of pasta - we were informed after being seated, ordering drinks and a bottle of wine, and deciding on the tasting menu - so at least 15-20 minutes passed since sitting down with zero mention of them being out of anything, which should have been mentioned when we were presented with the menu's   All of the fish dishes (ciappino and halibut) were overcooked and dry, as were the Short Ribs (which is hard to do)  My tenderloin came out rare vs med rare (which is fine for me) but was overly salty to the point it was about inedible, and also had a piece of bacon on top of it - why would you ruin a good piece of meat with strip of bacon on top - made no sense, sent it back  The cocktails there were very poor, French 75 I think only looked at the gin bottle instead actually having any poured in and the whiskey smash which was on their "special" menu was terrible - if Travis is a good bartender or runs a good bar program this was certainly not evident, and they have a Mai Tai listed on the menu but don't even have orgeat listed as an ingredient so that was enough to steer me off of that one, but I am sure it would have been very orangey and come in a Collins glass with a slice of orange  The only bright spot which was small (literally undersized) was the foie gras, which was done very well and seared, with a light jam underneath the toast, and some peanut butter-ish spread on the side with some huckleberries - however the portion was about the size of a tasting menu portion not an appetizer portion - perhaps they were running out of foie gras as well, but I don't expect 3 bites out of a $16 app  Poor all the way around - Do not waste your money here

Finally have a chance to get this post up, and I cannot believe we do not have a thread on Atlas Bisto because of how amazing it was. They had always been on "the list" of places to try, I wish we would have moved it to the top sooner. It is located in a strip mall on Scottsdale Road toward Tempe in a strip mall, as most of the good restaurants in the area are   Walking in it is a bit confusing as you go through AZ Wine, which is a very large wine store, with a great selection of Sake, Wine, Half Bottles, Craft Beer (Aventinus) so turn to your left and there you will see the dining area, if no one is immediatly there someone will pop up shortly as there are only two people working the front of the house. It is BYOB so you can bring a wine if you would like to or get there a bit early and browse, or bring your own wine and during the meal add something extra if you run out of wine (which we did!)  Below is the menu choices that we had on offering  First Course  Smoked Paprika Braised Pork Shoulder, Queso Cotija, Guacamole, Shaved Baby Radishes   Korabuta Pork Belly, Butternut Squash Hash, Tamarind Peach Glaze   Hand Rolled Porcini Gnocchi, Maitakes, Ginger Cabbage, Black Bean Miso Cream   Second Course  Grilled Romaine, Fried Rainbow Valley Egg, Spanish Anchovies, Capers, Raisins   Roasted Striped Beets, Gala Apples, Horseradish Cream, Prairie Breeze Amish Cheddar   Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, Peaches, Sweet Corn, Cranberries, Almonds, Arugula, Frisee *Add $5   Third Course  Grilled Pork Porterhouse, Spaetzle, Spaghetti Squash, Bacon Brussel Slaw, Amish Asian Pear Butter   Niman Ranch Tri-Tip Steak, Roasted Fingerlings, Baby Rainbow Carrots, Black Mesa Ranch Feta, Caper Aioli   Wild Caught Market Fish, White Beans, Cherry Tomatoes, Fennel, Baby Spinach, Green Goddess (Swordfish)   Now on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu, there were Sweetbreads for the First Course (+5 supp) and there was another option for the second course but I do not recall what it was  Course 1 - I had the Sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious (i cannot remembe what kind, the good kind) with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- I had been to Blackbird (1 star Michelin Chicago) who also served up a sweetbread 1st course, and this preperation blew it out of the water, and that was our favorite app we had there -- Also they gave a very good portion size as well, this was not a Restaurant Week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about RW is that many places don't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck, instead of trying to gain return clients  The Mrs had the Pork Belly, which I have to say was one of the best pork belly's i have had in a very very long time. It seems they are always overcooked and stringy instead of melt in your mouth lucious. The flavoring and cooking of it was perfect, again to releate it to Blackbird (because two of the 1st course apps were the same ingredient) Blackbird overcooked theirs and it we left some of it on the plate, I was lucky to get one bite of the Pork Belly from my wife  Our friends we went with, he ordered identical to me, and his wife went with the Gnocchi, she really enjoyed it however I did not try any of it  Course 2 - I had the Smoked Duck Salad, which was not exactly what i was expecting and I was pleasantly suprised. For some reason I expected warm duck, but it was chilled duck with just a light touch of smoke, to set off the flavor against the tangy peaches and sweet corn, it was amazing and way better than what i had pictured in my head - there was also TONS of duck in it, every bite huge piece of duck - just great  The Mrs had the Grilled Romaine with Anchovies, which was also very good, nice anchovies on it and she really liked it, however the duck salad was where it was at - our friends wife went with the off menu salad and she really liked it, I passed on trying it because it wasnt beating the duck salad  Course 3 - 3 of us had the Grilled Pork Porterhouse which was one of the best pork dishes that I have had, the only other one that i would rank up there when they had it on the menu was the Stuffed Pork Chop at Cowboy Ciao (no longer on the menu) this was was equal to it or better, they cooked it pretty close to medium rare which is perfect for me and everything about it was good, lots of flavor - The Mrs had the steak (when Todd was explaining the menu he was very elaborate about everything on the menu and then he was like "we have steak too") so that was really on the menu because you have to have a steak on the menu - It wasn't bad but when all the other flavors on every other course is off the charts, just a good steak isnt the same - however as a good husband I gave multiple pieces of the Pork Porterhouse to Mrs Dapuma  character limit

The place is hidden, and has arguably the best breakfest food in the area  What to get:  The Tenderloin Eggs Benedict (you can skip the pork and tenderloin and go straight for all tenderloin), and I would recommend subbing out the potato's for fries (usually they will do that if the fryer has time to get to temp, aka not at 7am but probably at 8) - That is the best item hands down on the menu, not cheap but if you order that you will have zero question why everyone rates this place so highly  Other excellent items:  Chille Relleno's - add one on if you arent 100% sure you want them as an entire order, they are fantastic  The Meatloaf if very good, it does sound a bit strange to get, doesnt beat filet at 8am, but is quite good  Adovada is also fantastic, very good heat and is worth a go if you want something on the spicer side  Mimosa's are $5 in the morning as with Blood Mary's - and their orange juice is always fresh squeezed

Had wanted to check this place out for awhile since It is a Packer Bar and they were supposed to be known for their green chile cheeseburger  - Walked in and almost every table was reserved for the game so it was a good atmosphere if you are a Packer fan, and that is where the highlights ended  It took about 30 minutes to get a beer, when i initially asked about the order she stated she was getting to it, and then proceeded not to come back to the table for another hour,  we ended up going up to the bar to make future orders after that instead of waiting for the waitress (however that issue was solved after the 1st Quarter, perhaps they were short staffed) Ordered their famous Green Chile burger and fries and got raw fries and a burger burnt to a crisp, was pretty unedible however the green chile could hide the burnt taste to get a couple bites down  Beers are cheap here - certainly eat before you come here, will not be making a return visit, pretty disappointing

Trader Vic's closed down so you would hope that Hula's would pick up the slack and make a proper tiki drink, however just like with The Breadfruit, highly disappointing rum drinks  If you cannot make a proper Mai Tai, you should not call yourself a tiki bar.  Beachbum Berry has laid out the proper way to recreate a Mai Tai, and there is not much room for variation other than amount of lime or orgeat  Having tried 3-4 drinks here you can rest assured the place gives rum drinks a bad name, however most do - just disappointing to see another, and it is the only "tiki" bar around  Did not try any food, so no comment there

Dakota, you know the food is bad here, why would you ever eat here again?  Great question, I am so glad you asked.  Having been here a couple times and been disappointed I had never intended to give it another chance, as Sam Fox restaurants are always guaranteed to underwhelm and chains should be avoided when possible.   A friend had a birthday party and it had been at least a 1+ years since I had been, so I went in with an open mind about giving it one more shot.  A friend had a birthday party there (unfortunately I could not talk them into changing the venue) after being handed a bunch of lemons it was time to make lemonade  The evening started off somewhat promising, they actually had a craft cocktail list (trying to capitalize on the craft cocktail craze and actually doing it well are two different stories) and the Mrs went with their modified version of a French 75 (very modified) which was Aperol, Strawberry infused simple syrup, gin, sparkling wine, and I believe lemon or lime, which was drinkable but a touch light on the gin, I went with a Perfect Martinez - My criteria for this selection was the products involved:  Miller Gin (excellent) Dolin Dry Vermouth (excellent) Carapno Anticia (excellent) and orange bitters (as long as you buy decent bitters or make your own you are fine here) and what came out was a slightly orangeish martini - a bit sweet and orangey but certainly drinkable.  That combination of ingredients in almost any ratio is probably decent.  Looking at the rest of the cocktail menu everything looked overly sweet and unbalanced but I could not resist the compulsion to confirm what I already knew and against common sense went with a Singapore Sling.  Which was super sweet bright red, wrong glass, wrong garnish, wretched drink - so in conclusion stick with items in a bottle here, the cocktail menu is for looking at not ordering from  Onto the food:  The soup of the day was Chili, which was salty to the point of inedible, the fondue pretzel with cheese dipwas up next, the pretzel quality was very poor, cardboardish and bland with the cheese tasting very processed.   We ordered charcuterie for our meal (as we suspected the food would be bad - and the charcuterie at Arrogant Butcher [another Sam Fox restaurant] is solid) and that was delivered to the other end of our table (large group) so by the time they figured out what happened they were going to bring out the same order to us [because of their mistake], with the rest of everyone's main course, however the main's came out and still not charcuterie, so we ended up canceling that order (it was about 20-30 min between the mistake and the mains coming out without them correcting the error) We also got a couple of the mussel app for the table - which was fine, it is hard to mess mussels up, the broth was ok nothing exceptional  So after about 2 hours in with very little eaten or to drink other than water, a couple mussels, and a few bites of bad bread, and 1 ok cocktail - it was the most exciting time of the evening, time to go! The Bday Girl did have an excellent time which was the most important part  If you do have to go there, try not to eat anything and stick with beer or wine - and you will be ok

I don't like donuts, however Bosa takes the lowly donut and makes it a pastry  The only donuts worth the calories  The Crumb and Raspberry filled are excellent  The ham and cheese crossaint is pretty solid, works nicely if you have some extra lunch meat at home you can heat up and eat alongside it, as for a couple bucks you are not going to get a ton of meat in the pastry, boars head pastrami works nicely

Handmade noodles, pretty much as good as it gets  Remember that just like Pho, you need to add vinegar, white pepper, chile paste, sirachi, soy, to the flavor profile you desire - it may take a few attempts to create the perfect flavor profile  However once you unlock your hidden combination it is fantastic  The best soup is the beef stew, it is superior to the ox tail, the oxtail is good but the beef stew is a better overall dish, and I highly recommend getting the salt and pepper shrimp, they serve you a huge plate of shrimp  The boiled peanuts and daikon are for texture and palate cleansing to break up the soft noodle and salty broth, great combination

I generally wont eat donut's not worth the calories, however their donuts are simply amazing  light airy with a nice crispyness to the outside - simply amazing  i recommend the coconut glazed with the crispys on the top (looks kind of like the gem hostess donuts)   worth every calorie

Best Coffee Place in the city, if you care about brew temperature, precise grind, perfect foam, the exacting science behind why different coffee tastes differently and why details matter, this is your place  Be warned, it will ruin every other coffee place in the city for you, if you have been to Blue Bottle in San Fran you know what I am talking about

fantastic place, Mario and Peter (owners) are awesome  Finally adding this review to my yelp  I went there last night (this isnt really last night it is few months ago - it is still excellent not too) and it was excellent - The beer list they have is fantastic and Mario who is a part owner was behind the bar and it was good talking to him  Arrived just at the end of happy hour, they have $1 off draft beers for happy hour and half priced glasses of wine and there was a certain amount off well drinks but i don't recall what that is  They are going to be working on their mixed drink menu, they wont have that ready to go for another week or two  Started out with Schneider Aventinus, Doppel Weizen Bock,Germany 8.2% which could be my new favorite beer, it is a unfiltered wheat bock, amazing  One of the nice touches is that they have the proper beer glass to go with each beer they have on tap in the appropriate sizes and the largest karmeliet glass i have ever seen, and they have a lot of imports on the list so they are doing great in the strong ale category - which is my favorite type of beer  As i was looking at the menu I asked if they had foie gras because i saw a picture on their facebook page, and Mario told me they always have that as an off the item menu and it could be prepared however I would like it - which sounded great to me  Foie Gras torchon with toast points, honey comb, apples, cherries - also had a lemon tuille and some micro greens as well  The honeycomb was a very nice touch because it got the sweetness however the bonus was the nice texture it added to the overall   My friend ordered Heirloom Tomatoes and Gioia Burrata and i got a taste of that, it was a great salad, and had small bread sticks and fresh pesto on it as well, very light and refreshing - just the thing after foie gras :)  for my main i ordered the crispy half duck, it was confit duck style, the skin was very crispy and it was a huge portion - the duck was very good the crispy duck skin fat had lots of flavor with it - and i was happy to have confit again since i still dream of the chez dumonet duck i had in Paris this summer - my only change i would have made was the side items it was served with, i would have liked dauphine potatoes - with that said it was the best duck i have had in AZ, and i was happy it was not just seared duck breast   My friends ordered the spinach Gnochi, Black Tagliolini, Mediterranean Sea Bass  I tried the Sea Bass, which was was very good, with the skin on crispy and crab on top the pasta dishes all looked amazing, although i didnt get to try them, i will certainly be trying them on my next visit  rubee while i was there quite a few people ordered the crispy ribs - they looked great and everyone said they were delicious  Seems like there will be specials each day as well based on what looks good in the market, everything coming out of the kitchen looked great - finally a place with an awesome beer list and delicious food - looking forward to seeing what they do with their cocktail list   will certainly be back and it is nice they have parking

Very small restaurant, perhaps 8 tables  The food was excellent, had the papas rellena as a starter along with a side of fried yucca, the aji verde sauce was delicious and spicy - i could eat that on anything  We also split the Pescado a lo Macho, which is fried fish with a seafood mix and spicy sauce served with jasmine rice   Excellent food, we will certainly be back as we love Peruvian food, similar in style to Contigo Peru (I believe they had the same chef at some point) - with a Yelp Deal how can you beat that

First time having Afgan food and it was delicious - The best way i could describe the food would be a cross between greek and indian food, however that is probably a very inacurate description - We ordered the Mantoo, which was a dumpling with meat inside served with a red spicy sauce and a white yogurt sauce, it was amazingly flavorful, and the young man with the glasses recommended ordering it for a first time visitor, and I would pass that along - We also got the Chicken Karahi, which was spicy chicken meat in a curried sauce - My wife loved this dish enough to go back a few days later and get it again.  I normally do not like curry at all, so if a dish has any I generally do not care for it (not that it isnt good, I just won't like it) this chicken was tender, and I actually asked for a couple pieces of it, very unique taste and also highly recommended, the chicken was bone in, super tender, and cooked perfectly.  That dish came with fresh baked Nan bread, which wasn't as crispy as Indian Naan bread but not as soft or fluffy as a pita, somewhere inbetween, however very good  In answer to people stating they do not have descriptions of what the food is, they have a blogsite that gives you pictures and descriptions of most things on the menu, so just bring your smartphone into the restaurant with you and they have a small sign on each table with the link to it, so you can try to figure out what you want to experience, and they were happy to answer questioins after we read the descriptions and looked at the pictures  http://khyberhalal.blogspot.com/  That is the description and pictures of most of the food - hope that helps  They are NOT open on Sundays even if the website does say so

Tried this place for the first time based on the good reviews and enjoying Tuck Shop, however this was a pretty epic fail   We arrive at the restaurant and were told by the barista how the menu and ordering works, and we placed our order of the mandatory BMOC and the grillades, and supplemented that with a Coconut Macaroon (not the French hard shell style) that looked good at the counter. We ordered hot green tea and a cappa  The macaroon was mainly coconut with very little cake to it, which was fun for a bit or two, then was one note and disappointing...which was a common theme  The tea came in a regular bag (which was a little bit disappointing for a place that touts their coffee, you would think tea would be more than an afterthought, and then the cappa - which ended up being an espresso covering in foam in a full sized coffee mug. It was clear the barista had no idea what they were doing, I am sure there is a name for espresso doted with foam but it was not in the right cup nor was it what I ordered - that was disappointing. They seem to specialized in cold brew and had 5 or 6 of them going, so maybe that is all they are good at, it certainly isn't making a milk based coffee drink  The food looked good upon coming out however and the first bite of the BMOC was pretty good, the waffle with syrup and apples was done properly and the pork chop was a good piece of meat, the egg was cooked well. The issue was that it was unbalanced when the components were eaten seperatly and one note when eaten together. The pork chop was salty and a bit oversmoked, so for a bite or two it was great, then it was boring.  The grillades was pretty poor all the way around, the biscuit's were not very good and the meat was simple pressed ground beef and it was overly salty, the gravy was not that appealing, a pretty poor rif on traditional biscuit's and gravy  about 1/3rd of the way through the meal we decided we were wasting calories and it was time to go  If you want a great waffle and pork chop - Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty amazing upon comparison - I had wanted to try this place to give it a comparison, and it really makes Matt's stand out, simplicity done well is very hard and they do it there, not so much at Vovomeena

Breafast Items to Order:   Healthy:  Turkey Sausage White Out Hungover:  Breakfast Nachos Somewhere in between:  Chorizo Buritto Buttermilk pancakes are also very good  They also have HH 4-8, if you need a drink a Dr Hendricks is what you need (Hendrick's / St Germain / Pingo Grigio Simple Syrup) and a good Bloody Mary if you like them

Unfortunately Daily Dose has decided to start using cheaper ingredients and has really gone downhill.  They changed their house made turkey sausage for the worse (tastes overcooked, old, frozen) the last 3 times I have been in, so it has not been a 1 time thing.  Last few times have been disappointing, which is a shame as this was once a great breakfast place.  With so many other good options close by, I do not believe we will be making another return visit

Got a Cole Turkey and the Bobbie, because they roast their own turkeys in house, and The turkey meat itself was pretty good - the problem is that they drenched the turkey in so much mayo and Russian dressing and then the coleslaw had a lot of mayo in it, I had to pull out just the meat and actually dry the meat off  The amount of fat in the mayo, russian dressing, and coleslaw was insane I could feel my heart slowing looking at it,. after a couple paper towels of wipe down - there was very little actual meat on the sandwich (a medium) and it was mainly bread and sauce   The bread was nothing special - this turned out to be highly disappointing, they certainly are not the best sandwich shop on the block much less the country  The Bobbie was also drenched in mayo but less so, and that one had more meat was better put together and the Mrs liked it  The cookies were just ok to me however the Mrs enjoyed the sugar one quite a bit   Unlikely we will be back, if we ever do we will certainly ask for all sauces on the side  It is a shame because they have good quality turkey meat pulled from a real turkey and hide it with bad bread and sauces, sometimes less is more

Not sure what I can say that everyone else has not already said:  Their Pork Chop is excellent, I generally get the Waffle (it is very hard to get a good waffle that uses it's own batter versus pancake batter) and sub out the bacon for the Pork Chop (+4.25), their hashbrowns are amazing one of the best ever (per Mrs D) and their homemade strawberry preserves are exceptional  The more simple a dish is, the higher the execution needs to be and the sourcing of the ingredients needs to be, and Matt's does an excellent job of both - They do a great job with a small menu that they can execute at a high level, for American Breakfast food you cannot beat Matt's if you can get there before it is packed

Bland food and cheap ingredients lead to a disappointing meal and a guarantee not to return  Went with the French Quarter with extra shrimp, and for $13 you would expect at least mid sized shrimp, not the baby shrimp that it comes with, also coming in a to go container that Whole Foods uses.  It was pretty bland, not terrible, however the uncooked red onion was a bit overpowering.  I would certainly never want to eat this again, and could make the same thing with better shrimp for half the price.  Medium sized shrimp on the high side are $8.  The acai bowl we ordered was not really even an acai bowl, i would rate it a 1   We ordered the cococabana which had banana in it, even though it is not listed as an ingredient on the menu, also it was served in a smoothy cup, (serve it in the right vessel) and was not pleasant tasting  The mixed reviews here should be a warning to you (a warning I ignored)   If you have taste buds and don't want to be disappointed, you can steer clear of Grabbagreen
