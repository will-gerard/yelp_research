VERY CUTE thai spot on main st that was able to accommodate our big group! our meal was okay overall but no dishes stood out & food seemed to cater to the American palate  we shared everything family style! ---thai iced tea: WAY too sweet ---pad kee mao: again too sweet but i liked this better than the pad thai! ---pad thai: just okay, really missing those authentic Thai flavors  ---duck curry: not a fan of this tomato based curry, i was expecting a richer flavor ---thai chicken lettuce wraps: chicken was a bit dry ---crispy vietnamese spring rolls on salad one of the better appetizers ---tom yum soup: great for sharing since it comes in a huge pot that is kept warm at the table over a fire  ONE GRIPE (minus one star): my friend ate only a few bites of her vegetarian glass noodles & asked them to box it up to take home BUT THEY forgot and threw it away!! instead of taking it off the bill they still made her pay for half the plate even though she had barely ate any!  NOTE: i guess you can do sake bombs here, because the LOUD group next to us was celebrating a birthday

a restaurant that's INSIDE a grocery store that sells middle eastern fair   the plates have TONS of food, i couldn't even finish half! i guess it's perfect if you like leftovers but i think i'll just stick with a sandwich next time --chicken schwarma: comes w/ hummus, pita bread, rice & tabouli salad...chicken was served w/ a garlic sauce that was very yummy but i wish the sauce was on the side because it drowned the chicken --gyro plate: yummy gyro! comes w/ iceberg lettuce salad, pita bread, & rice   NOTE: i appreciate their toasting of the pita bread  friendly service & portions that make it a bang for your buck!

the BEST 3am $4.99 STEAK AND EGGS you can find in vegas!!!... yeah its a little off the strip, but its pretty darn close & it'll be LOADS better than the other drunken steak and eggs out there!  for around 5 bucks you get a huge steak, eggs, & toast.. i was seriously NOMMING on THE happiest drunkie meal of my life!!  yeah its no ritzy vegas hotel.. BUT you will not be dissappointed!!.... ALTHOUGH i must say that finding a cab back from ellis island to the strip was a little difficult at this hour!

People have been saying that the buffet isn't what it used to be.... But this was my first time so I thought it was pretty good!!  Even at 8pm on a sunday night there was a 1 hour wait!! $30 pp for dinner  Prime rib was yummy! Loved the ahi & salmon poke, steamed seabass was surprisingly moist & flavorful, enjoyed the salad station, go for the crab legs & shrimp cocktail! Ppl mentioned the pesto mashed potatoes & they were indeed enjoyable as well as the creamed spinach. Fresh fruits!  As far as dessert the tiramisu, Creme brûlée, & cheesecake weren't amazing but good for buffet standards!  NOTE : if you're just getting in at the last hour of dinner before closing GET FOOD AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, they stop refilling things toward the end

if there's ever such thing as TOO MANY CHOICES FOR DESSERT, you'll find it at Jean Phillipe Patisserie @ the Aria!!  they have eeeeeverything from cookies to pastries to ice cream to candy to chocolate to cake to coffee .... just go overload your eyes for yourself!!  with NO SURPRISE, i couldn't decide & asked a worker for the ONE dessert  i had to try & she suggested the dark chocolate mousse because you can finish it w/o it becoming too sweet!  it was definitely a good dessert but ten bucks for such a small dessert is just outrageous!!! which brings me to give jean 3.5 stars!!

YUMMY PASTIES, and no i'm not referring to the ones you're used to. Pasties here are thin flaky pastries filled with many savory options from american to indian influenced   one pasty is perfect as a meal & the crust is what makes them so good ---oggie: the beef wasn't the best but the potatoes were flavorful! i liked the red wine gravy that comes as a dipping sauce!  i can't wait to come back & try other options  NOTE: in terms of atmosphere don't expect to walk into grandmas house because they serve up pasties, think dark dive bar (which was perfect as a low key lunch after our crazy night)

Bouchon, the little Kiosk/counter hidden in the Venetian!! you were so small.. so i thought you would offer less selection.. yet i still managed to walk away with so many of your treats!!  We asked for the worker's favs: ----APPLE CROISSANT: i have to say.. w/ the extreme flakiness and perfect moistness of the apples... BEST APPLE DESSERT IVE EVER HAD ---bread pudding: it was meeHh.. thicker, denser, & drier than I prefer  Other items I got: ----vanilla macaron: SO big, CHEWY & yummy. not too sweet compared to macarons i've had in the past but the cookies were more cake-y than meringue-y ----Bouchon: a mini brownie with a Milk chocolate center! it was rich and indulgent, and just the right size/amount!  cute how their disposable utensils look like "silverware" from a far!  a perfect ON THE GO breakfast before we left Vegas =), why did the one in LA close down ...?!

so thankful for The Street after being relatively deprived of asian desserts in Tucson (except Bing's Boba)  LOTS OF SEATING, our large group of 11 was well accommodated as the friendly workers put together huge tables for us   FYI the drinks only come in a large size, bang for your  buck i guess? well portions here in general are just GINORMOUS, the "tiny" diamond ice is enough to share btwn 2 ppl while the "medium" is enough to share btwn 5!! --diamond ice: TONS of toppings, they really don't skimp. not bad --coffee milk tea: standard  NOTE: no credit card minimum! i guess i've been jaded by NYC and LA

after rolling out of bed WELL past breakfast & lunch, earl of sandwich sounds like a great vegas-cheap eat  we shared 2 of their signature hot sammies! which aren't amazing BUT when you're hungry in vegas & on budget... the toasted bread & ingredients do wonders ----the full montagu ----the carribean jerk chicken!  NOTE: everyone's got the same idea..you'll probably run into someone you know here.. soOOo look alive!!!

LOVELY SUITES! beautiful bathrooms with a makeup table, 2 sinks, separate toilet room, bathtub & shower (although the bathroom doesn't lock so make sure ppl know its occupied!)  2 queen sized beds in the upper area, a sunken living room (each level  with its own TV)  friendly CRAPS DEALERS who taught me how to win $55 dollars haha but thats NOTHING in vegas NOTE: if you look too young, as I do, and are sick of getting carded in the casino, go to the security desk and ask for a wristband so you don't need to take your ID out a bajillion times!  Location of one of the GRAND LUX CAFEs which is perfect for late night munchies!  3 sets of elevators to access the rooms meant for 3 different number sets of floors = MORE EFFICIENT foot traffic!  EASY ACCESS to the Wynn if you want to go to XS & Venetian for BOUCHON BAKERY  overall, I am very pleased!

3.5 STARS. Payard is a convenient brunch & breakfast spot in Caesar's palace but probably not worth trekking for  Sit-down brunch: ---croque madame: my fav of the dishes we tried. Toasty crust! ---quiche: another fav since it was flavorful ---lobster benedict: pretty bland & the potato waffle wasn't crispy ---omelet: pretty standard  You get a complimentary basket of bread (nothing special) but the waiters here go out of their way for you!!  Also went to the cafe side for pastries & coffee ---coffee: not bad, they have soy milk options! ---almond croissant: tasty filling ( I wish I tried it fresh but I ate it at night, so it wasn't as flaky) ---chocolate croissant: a bit dry (but again i at this at night) ---cheese danish: FLAKY GOODNESS, had this one fresh right when they opened!! Mmm perfect sweetness in the center  THANK GOD they open at 6am for you earlybird travelers!

Their Gelato was airy and not really that great, most flavors were too sweet AND creamy while lacking in bold flavor  $6 plus for a single scoop?! they have tons of flavors but I wasn't impressed  ---mint chocolate chip: ehh just okay ---cappuccino: I usually like a good espresso flavor but this along with the Nutella coffee flavor were too sweet!  Meh just here for convenience when you're stuck in the hotel

Almost 3 am on a saturday (technically sunday morning) AND THEY'RE STILL OPEN, HORRAY.. yeah i know I'm lame for coming back from the club so early!.. but after 3 am this palazzo location wont let you in SO you'll have to try the venetian location which opens later  COMPLIMENTARY sour dough bread as you sit and wait... though its nothing spectacular  FOOD CAME OUT FAST.. although time may have been flying by faster in my somewhat intoxicated mind.. ---short rib grilled cheese was pretty TASTY ---ahi tuna burger was yummy too (but i'd definitely get the short rib sammie over this one!)   the waiter was really nice & accommodating! he never rushed us even though we got in just before closing!

We settled for this restaurant in caesar's palace because the parents were too tired to go elsewhere  I feel like their hand pulled noodles might lure customers in but these were pretty OVERcooked & served in BLAND beef soup.  I'm actually glad I went with the Singapore noodles instead, although in terms of flavor they weren't TOO much better  Overpriced underwhelming Chinese food  NOTE they offer takeout but if the kitchen is too busy they say it can take up to an hour ?! SKIPpppp

SOLID & CHEAP thai option that offers better thai than Tucson does (from what i've tried thus far)  LARGE PORTIONS, i could not finish my dish ---pad kee mao: PERFECTLY cooked noodles w/ a nice variety of veggies, yumm  interestingly enough this casual restaurant looks like it's connected to the supermarket  NOTE: you can choose your level of spice & medium spiciness was perfect for me

A quick & convenient option when you've got meetings in the sands convention center at the CRACK OF DAWN!! Vegas can be so cruel   ---ice blended mocha: a good breakfast option to go with my banana.. It's pretty much the same price as starbucks.. I wasn't expecting the chocolate drizzle though  NOTE: they also offer pastries, yogurt, etc if you need more than a drink to hold you over

HEFTY 8 OZ burger in the cosmopolitan!  you can get your burger on a white OR wheat bun ---gold standard burger: pretty good! i liked the strong cheese flavor & char-grilled smokyness to the patty... ALTHOUGH my patty was unevenly cooked, which was a bit of a bummer ---burgers come w/ steak OR shoestring fries... shoestring were definitely yummier!   NOTE:you can ask for other sauces besides ketchup & mustard, but the chipotle mayo sauce we had wasn't too impressive  FREE house beer OR house margarita w/ a foursquare check-in!

i usually am NOT a fan of buffets.. but this place really puts other buffets to SHAME!  they have a lot of individually-sized portion items & some not.. if you want to try everything.. your table should just get one of each & then decide what you want 2nds of!  AMAZING DESSERT SELECTION.. especially the humungo chocolate covered strawberries!!!  WAY BETTER than the wynn buffet & cheaper too!!!

FORGET ABOUT XS its all about MARQUEE now!! but you better have a hook up because the lines for this place are long and still go on past 2 am! we got special passes 2 guys get $35 cover w/ 2 girls in free!! & got to cut the line  there are apparently 2 stories but I only made it to the bottom floor!! there are seemingly 2 dance floors downstairs.. one by the stage w/ tons of lights flashing from overhead & (once that one gets too crowded) another one forms by the BAR  the outside is lovely!! beautiful seating.. i think i remember an outdoor bar...  you line up & enter from the upstairs OUTSIDE, then you go through an elevator and end up downstairs INSIDE  above and beyond performed when I was there.. but i have little recollection of that..  JUST GO & FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!!

SECRET GEM!!! ... literally a secret, you can't even find this pizzeria listed on the cosmo's directory!!!  its a CHEAP vegas meal option on the 3rd floor cosmopolitan in between 2 fancy restaurants.. behind a large wooden door w/o any name to distinguish it!!  walk down the long hall towards the pinball machine & order pizza w/ fresh olive-oil-soaked-tomatoes on it YUM & only 4 something for this thin crust slice!!!  i hope this small pizza place stays a secret =)

RICH, CREAMY, FLAVORFUL ice cream, need i say more? they can also create sundaes, floats, sammies, and shakes from your ice cream of choice  the workers are super nice & cheery, i hope they are like that all the time! --vietnamese coffee: YASSS for all the coffee lovers!  NOTE: in a "single scoop" you can mix two flavors! wish i knew this when i ordered

pizza that gives NYC a run for it's money! now that i'm moving from NYC back to LA i'd have to say pizzeria bianco is the closest pizza that compares to my NYC loves  you can order pizzas HALF/HALF which i wish i knew when i ordered ---lambrusco: perfect pairing to the pizza ---complimentary italian bread: baked so well & they give you quality EVOO to dip ---SONNY BOY: MUST TRY, so good ... i want another right now ---wise guy: a "white" pizza that was good too but i prefer my pizzas with tasty tomatoe sauce  ---gnocchi too sweet & the pastas we ordered weren't cooked al dente so i'd stick to the pizzas  NOTE: you need 6 or more ppl to make an RSVP

Small ramen bar WAY off the strip, it was about a $20 taxi ride from our hotel  They have some bar seating and some tables but if you're coming with a large group id advise coming at an off lunch hour  ---agedashi tofu: not bad ---kimchi: nice side dish ---tonkatsu ramen made spicy and with thick noodles: you can choose your noodles, good spice to the broth and yummy pork belly   NOTE: $5 minimum credit charges

NEWEST CLUB IN VEGAS!! i really like the set up! & as a girl, it was easy to get in w/ a promoter (2 free drink tickets for girls & free admission!)  AWESOME opening dj but I didn't catch his name & the headliner Zedd didn't come out too late which helps!!  NOTE: the bass is a bit TOO pumped .. im pretty sure i lost a lot of ear cells!

QUICK convenient cafe in the Phoenix airport when you've got few options to begin with!!  i like this cafe because i was looking for a salad, and normally airport salads are expensive & limp BUT they had a nice bacon spinach salad w/ strawberries here which was pretty cheap (it's extra if you add chicken)  workers were SUPER nice  NOTE: you can order at the register for a fresh salad OR if you're in a rush, they have pre-made ones in the fridge that you can grab & go
