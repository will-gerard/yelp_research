My wife and I were in the neighborhood as we had taken our daughter to check out PHX zoo. We heard about this place from diners, drive in and dives and had to check it out.  we were starving and had a wait for a full two hours prior to being seated! :( This place is a hole in the wall!! However, the breakfast was worth the wait! My wife had the bacon and waffle and enjoyed it so much that she ordered another order of the waffle. I had the special which was to die for, scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, peppers and cheese.  will definitely come back if we are nearby!!

we have been to multiple thai restaurants in the SE Valley and this restaurant was by far the worst thai food we have eaten around here!! Service was alright but food quality was sub par... not returning

I went to this restaurant with my wife and ordered roghan gosh and chicken makhani. the food was delicious. We complimented this meal with Onion and special Naan, which was an excellent choice. No complaints about the food at all. My wife ordered mango lassi which she thoroughly enjoyed. We have been to other indian restaurants in the southeast valley and we definitely rate as one of our favorites!
