This place really doesn't deserve the one star..  I went on Yelp to find the nearest Urgent Care after my mom had just had a bad fall (which ended up resulting in breaking both bones in her wrist), I called them and they said there was absolutely no one else in. Perfect, right? Wrong.. We got there and were "greeted" with staff with attitude    I've never been so disappointed to see so much attitude to people in pain. I tried my best to be polite, but their responses were rude & snappy. I filled out paperwork & the receptionist said she would call me when she was done with the paperwork, however, she put the paperwork on the desk & walked away to laugh with her coworkers in the back. Then when everything was finished, the MA didn't even call my mom by name, she just said, "are you ready?"   It wasn't necessarily what they said, but more so HOW they said it.. I was shocked to see such nice reviews on Yelp after this experience.. Maybe we came on a bad day, but regardless, we won't be coming back..

I've been to my fair share of salons that do brow waxing, but this is definitely the last place I will ever go to. I live in Gilbert, but I drive all the way here just to see Laura. She is definitely an expert in her craft :)

After going to a few scrub places, I'm glad I held off until I checked this last store. Bree, the sales associate was more than accommodating. I told her what I was looking for after finding no luck and she found the perfect scrubs for me! I'm happy this place is so close to home too!

I don't think I've ever been so happy that I forgot to bring my lunch to work! I stopped at 24 Carrots on a whim because I wanted something that was healthy, but wouldn't break the bank. I'm so glad I stopped in.   The staff was friendly and was able to help me narrow down exactly what would satisfy my craving for curry. I was even being helped by a regular customer that drives 30 miles just to come here! She convinced me that I NEEDED to try their dessert & k caved! I wish that I took a picture of it, but it was a cute mango, coconut & cashew cream parfait that was seriously the best thing I've ever tasted! It was the perfect amount of sweet! & the best part? No sugar added!   Back to my meal, I ended up choosing their Buddha Bowl. It was EXACTLY what I was wanting. Perfect amount of spice & the curry flavor was just what I was craving. It's also a generous helping. I easily saved the rest for tomorrow's lunch.   Bottom line, this place is definitely worth a try & I'm so happy I stopped in. This will not be the last
