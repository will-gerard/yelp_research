Great wine specials! Sunday's $5 glasses of wine and their Monday & Tuesday special of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20 is amazing! It does get busy so don't go if you're in a hurry but it is worth a try.

First off we walk to the counter to be helped and the lady just stood there ignoring us. Then when she finally acknowledged us, she couldn't find the wedding party until after 10 attempts. She then walked away half way through helping us to help someone else and left us at the counter. After 10 minutes said she could finally take care of us. Her rudeness and inability to help us properly made us want to leave. When measuring for the tuxedo, she didn't measure properly and had to request different sizes without her helping with the sizing. To top it off, when we requested an extension of the rental until Tuesday (from a wedding on Friday) because we will be out of the country, they refused. Even the manager said she could only give us an extension to Monday even though we politely asked for Tuesday due to being out of the country. After dealing with the ignorance of our initial associate and the lack of customer service from the manager, I would never recommend anyone to go here nor send anyone in a wedding party to go here.

I've been getting my hair done by Elena for a few years now and she is amazing. She is very knowledgeable of different techniques and styles. I highly recommend going to her. I have sent numerous friends and family to her and everyone is very pleased with her work. She can achieve anything.

If I could give zero stars I would. They don't guarantee their work and treat their customers with absolutely no respect. I do not recommend anyone to go here. I had a purse lining stitched up but they didn't do all of it like requested. When I brought it back, he said it would cost me more money. the man argued with me and told me he wouldn't do anything unless I paid him more money. I highly recommend finding a different place to get any purses fixed. This place is not worth the disrespect you will get.

This place had great subs that delivery with amazing soups and cookies but the last few times I've tried to order, non one answers the phone and you can't order online either... Way to get rid of a loyal customer...

The turkey pastrami is amazing! I recommend it to everyone! Make it even better by having the pretzel fondue as an appetizer. Service could use a little improvement but the food is amazing!!!!

I've been here twice now and both times were amazing!!! I found a deal they were running on VoiceDailyDeals.com which made me check them out. I had their Greek pizza the first time which surprised me on how good it was and the second time was the chicken pizza which was delicious! Light and thin crust with the perfect amount of toppings and cheese. The gentleman that works there who I think is the owner was super nice and gave great service. Def need to check this place out!
