This place was awful -- I went in to get a pixie cut and ended up getting my head shaved (I kid you not). Apparently pixie cut to this particular stylist meant buzzing my hair off. She also still charged me full price for the cut. I would never go back here again.

I came to this hospital twice when I had viral meningitis. The first time, I spent all of two seconds with the hospital's neurologist who diagnosed me with cluster migraines and sent me on my merry way after not running any diagnostic tests. The second time I was admitted was a couple of days later when I started having symptoms of a stroke/seizures. At this point, I was totally out of it, but was told by my parents (who were with me all night) that the emergency staff stuck me on a bed out in the hallway all night because they didn't have any rooms available. During this time, I was having constant seizures and was apparently clutching my head and calling out to people passing by to help me. Since I was basically having strokes (brain swelling had reached really dangerous levels), I was also squirming away from the nurses when I finally DID get a room and was taken in for testing shortly after that. Because of the squirming and general uncooperativeness, the head nurse threatened not to treat me and then asked my parents if I was "special." In other words, I could have died out in that hallway where they left me all night with no supervisory medical technician.  After that whole mess, I received a bill for over $1000 several days later. That, of course, was efficiently handled.   Obviously I'll never go back here again.

I "saw" Dr. Rudgear for a few years when I moved to Arizona. I actually saw her perhaps once when I first became their patient, but was much more familiar with her PAs, who were very perfunctory. They spent about five minutes with me, telling me information that I already knew, then sent me on my way.  What I also didn't particularly like (and this might be a personal preference, is that this practice seems to specialize in every single medical fad currently in favor. Every time I went to the desk to check in, I saw advertisements for Latisse. Similarly, all of their employees were wearing T-shirts advertising some kind of service having to do with hormonal supplements. Perhaps if the practice had chosen to just specialize in the service they advertise to the public, they might better treat their patients.

Pizza bowls (gluten free), really nice staff that stayed after closing hours because I was an idiot and ordered from the wrong store, and the best chocolate cake ever. Seriously. The chocolate cake is evil incarnate. I ate two pieces and would have had to have walked from East Mesa to downtown Phoenix to work off the calories, but it was worth it!

Really love what Aubriel has done to my hair -- I went to her for a few years before I got tired paying the high prices (which is why Mood Swings gets a 4 star review instead of a five). I've also seen a few other stylists when I couldn't get in with Aubriel and have yet to have a bad color or cut. I would suggest, however, looking elsewhere for manicures / pedicures -- the prices were also a bit high and the pedicure wasn't that awesome.

I walk here regularly from my house (I live over a mile away) and it's very well-lit at night, includes a few walking paths (the longest one being 1.7 or something long) and armadas set up for picnics, grilling, and the like. There are also several playgrounds that look well-kept and some volleyball courts, which are not so well-kept. Fishing is allowed with some restrictions and a valid license. The only thing I didn't really like is the smell sometimes wafting from the pond (very common in AZ) and the hordes of teenagers inhabiting the park in the late evenings. Park closes at 10, and they're usually there on skateboards until closing time being generally annoying to all passerby.   **This could just be me being curmudgeonly.

Ok, plusses: The prices were awesome. The student workers were super nice (and super young!) and got checked on by the instructors quite often during the whole process. Also, the instructors tend to do some of the more complicated things themselves if the students feel uncomfortable.   Minuses: It takes for stinkin' ever. I got a color and a trim and it took over 4 hours. Also, the color didn't really come out well either time I've been there (the first color was supposed to come our dark red and came out purple instead -- which I decided to go with because purple is awesome even though it was unintentional). I also got an undercut, which was done pretty badly, mainly because they don't allow the students to have clippers with guards on them.   So, if you're getting something relatively uncomplicated with no color or easy color, this place will work for you, especially given the price. Anything other than that, I would suggest that you look to a professional salon -- which some people might say is common sense, but needed to be experienced first-hand for me. Maybe I'm dense that way :-P
