I love this place! It is a truly hidden gem. I also love Taste of Tops in Tempe. I have a few friends that call this our "secret bar" and bring anyone we deem ready for the awesomeness that is within.  However, I had one experience here that I'm hoping was an isolated incident.  Normally we have had the middle aged male bartender (I forget his name). He is so friendly and accommodating. He is probably more than half the reason I love this bar. However tonight we went in (on a Saturday night) a little before 9 and a young woman was there bar-tending. She made a point of telling us right away that they were closing in an hour. Then as we were enjoying our beverages, we paid out and continued to finish our drinks in a timely fashion (it was just before ten at this point). As we were talking, the bartender came back to the room where we were sitting, turned off almost all of the lights, except for the ones directly above us, and locked the bathroom doors. A male customer told her he needed to use the restroom and she seemed annoyed as she unlocked the door for him. We promptly left and all agreed that if we were to go back and see this same female bartender, we would not stay. She is doing a disservice to the reputation and feel of this wonderful and friendly bar.

I was very disappointed in my experience here. I work downtown, and was recruited by an enthusiastic man they had hired to hand out fliers on the street. My boyfriend and I went in for breakfast one morning. The server was friendly, but incredibly awkward and would mostly only look at my boyfriend in his interactions with us.   Then there is the food, which was the biggest atrocity. I ordered the huevos rancheros. Normally I think of eggs, tortillas, beans, cheese, sauce, etc. What I received looked like a thin burrito. No sauce, nothing on the outside. So I thought, "hmm, that's unconventional, but it must all be inside." Nope. All that was inside the rolled up tortilla was cooked eggs and a few pieces of onion. Nothing else. Almost as an afterthought, the server asked if I wanted any salsa on the side. I couldn't believe it. Not to mention the hash browns. They were half under cooked, and half burnt.   I will never return to this establishment. My boyfriend and I were so disappointed with our experience, we heard a random man on the street tell his coworkers that maybe they should go to Squash Blossom, and we stopped him to suggest he not bother.

I would just like to preface this by saying that I have worked in the restaurant/food industry for the last 15 years.  Jimmy John's sandwiches are ok, nothing stupendous.  Their sign says "free smells" but all I can smell are cleaning products.  Every time I have been in this establishment (approximately 3 times, I have a friend who swears by the place), there are way more employees than customers.  They clean non-stop, which isn't a bad thing in terms of it being a very clean place.  However, they are always noisily pulling out tables and chairs, standing on chairs cleaning lamps, and other incredibly distracting things.  If I am trying to talk to someone and eat, it is hard to do when all I hear are the 15 employees talking and tables scraping across the floor.  Also, most of the employees that work the registers are not very genuinely friendly.  It seems like a forced effort, as though talking to you is the last thing they want to be doing.  We'll see how long they stay in business, but if they don't change some things, I can't imagine it will be long.

This little Italian bistro is an unassuming, tucked away gem. We went there after looking at the other reviews on yelp, and were not disappointed. My coworkers and I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, a calzone, the cheesy fries, and tiramisu.  First of all, the portions are VERY generous. The calzone, for the average person, would be enough for 3 meals. I was with a 20-something man who never has an issue clearing his plate. Well, this time he did.   The fries were covered in what was the tastiest, garlic-infused mozzarella. It is also a big helping. The vegetarian sandwich came on beautiful bread and was overflowing with marinated and cooked veggies, topped off with that delightful mozzarella again.   Then there is the calzone. We ordered a vegetarian calzone (made to our specifications). I already mentioned the size (epic!), but the flavors involved are a beautiful combination. Many times, a calzone is pretty straightforward. Cheese, sauce, other fillings, etc. This was such an intricate pallet of flavors, it's clear a lot of thought, and skill, went into its creation.  Last, but certainly not least, was the tiramisu. It's a big piece, creamy, great flavors-none of which overwhelm the others.   Seriously, this place is great. The owners, Claudio and Nadine, are charming and welcoming (Claudio is the Sicilian chef, and talks to customers while bustling around in the kitchen). Make sure to not be in a big hurry, because this quality (and quantity) of food can't be rushed. The prices are very reasonable, and it was an overall delightful experience. We plan on going back very soon!
