Last night the a/c unit for upstairs went out on our new home that's only 2.5 years old. Aside from the fact that a unit shouldn't be breaking that early on in its lifespan, we were exasperated because it's been record-breaking heat here the last few days. Of course. After checking our home builders' site, we found that Chas Roberts was the installer and we would need to contact them for service. After reading reviews online, I begrudgingly decided to call. I waited until 8am this morning (a Sunday) and an answering service picked up. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the gentleman was as he took my information and assured me a call back soon since they opened at 8am. Well, I should have known... 2 hours later I still hadn't received a call. So I tried again at 10am. Got the answering service again. This time it was a woman who was unsure why my first call never went anywhere but again, assured me that the tech would be getting in touch with me "very soon" to schedule the service. By noon (4 hours later), I called again and the lady who answered told me that I just needed to wait because my information was with Scheduling and that's all she could say. I asked her to cancel my request and then called Hendel's Refrigeration, who immediately answered and got a tech scheduled for this afternoon. Ironically enough, while the Hendel tech was here (exactly at the beginning of the time window I was given), the Chas Roberts tech called and said he was getting in touch to schedule my appointment. I told him he was misinformed and I would no longer be needing his service. Now, I know not to waste my time with Chas Roberts and I sure hope anyone reading this knows it too.

Just left the restaurant after coming to enjoy dinner as a family. My husband ordered wings, which 30 minutes later, still hasn't arrived. The rest of us at the table had finished our food before the waitress even came to check on us. She was surprised to find out that his food hadn't arrived... I couldn't believe it. She was counting on the food runners to do her job and she had nothing to say. Turns out they gave his food to the table behind us, which they selfishly accepted. 15 minutes later, the manager came over to apologize and said his meal would be comped (as it should be) but it took another 10 or so minutes for them to bring his food. When they did, my husband asked for an extra side of ranch, which, after all that, they charged us $0.50 for. Such a disappointment; needless to say I will not be coming back and I hope they get their customer service act together soon before they lose more customers.

There's people who do makeup, and then there's makeup ARTISTS. Bryanna is an AMAZING artist!! She is not only the most talented makeup artist I have seen (if you don't believe me, take a look at her site), she has been doing my eyelash extensions for a couple months and I absolutely love them. At first I was pretty reluctant because I didn't want to worry about the time or investment, but they are worth every minute and every penny. She's incredibly professional and the whole process is pretty easy. I have gotten tons of compliments and was surprised that people don't automatically realize I have them! So glad I don't have to worry about mascara or taking off eye makeup, either. Makes a huge difference in saving time for me.   Thanks Bry!!!
