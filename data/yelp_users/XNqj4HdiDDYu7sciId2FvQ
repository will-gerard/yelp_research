I went here today with a friend for lunch.  We were looking for a good teppanyaki experience.  I've had better than Ah So.  The cook barely spoke to us.  The show lasted between 10-15min, and there was no flare.  I am a regular at Hayashi and was hoping for a comparable experience.  This was not.    We had the gyoza and california roll which were the best part of the meal.  The rest of it was eh.  The vegetables were bland, the rice was unflavorful, and the chicken was dry.

I have been using All-Star Animal hospital since i moved here in 2006.  Today we went for a check-up and to have my dog's ears checked.  The staff here is always very friendly and helpful, and the doctors are very knowledgeable.  The only problem I have with them are their prices...they are pretty high, but it is a good quality of service...

The food is phenomenal!  However, the service - not so much. We sat down, ordered some water, and began to look at the menu.  The server did not come back for quite some time...when he finally did, we ordered some drinks and the blue cheese stuffed olives. He offered my mom a taste of the wine before she ordered it, and that was helpful.  After we got our drinks, my mom and I both ordered the chopped salad which I called OMG in a bowl.  We also ordered some cibatta to go with the salad.  The salads came - they are AMAZING!  Halfway through the salad, my mom reminded the server of the bread.  At the end of the salad, the bread arrived.  The bread was...fabulous..but would've been nicer to eat WITH the salad, instead of after the salad.  At the end of the meal, the server remembered the olives, so he brought those with the check.  He did not charge us for them, but still it would have been nice to have WITH the drinks.  I joked with my mom that we had a backwards meal. Bottom line - the food is terrific..a good value for the price.  However, the service was sub-par.

I have been here twice.  The food is really good...the service, not so much.  The first time, the waitress was swamped, so we gave her some leeway.  This time, the server looked like he'd rather be anywhere but serving our table.  My friend ordered a drink which he had to remind the server twice to bring.  He rarely came to our table and when we asked him about desserts, he just about rolled his eyes and sighed.  But...the part that will cause me to not go back to Frank and Lupes -- There were ants on the rim of my water glass.  Dead, but still ants.  I showed it to the busboy who promptly took it away, but still...ants.  While the food is good (the salsa is yummy!), I am disappointed in the service and the cleanliness.

WOW!  What an amazing experience!  My mom, myself, and our friend went there for their second saturday market and tasting demonstrations.  When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by several happy, warm workers who looked genuinely happy to be there and that we were there.  The tasting stand was just getting set up, and they were kind of surprised to see us.  Randy, the manager, Jeremy the executive chef, Anthony the sous chef, as well as others made sure that our experience was incredible from the start!  We were the only people attending the tasting demonstration to start and as I said to them, I felt like a rock star!  The food was amazing, fresh, and so nice that it was organic.  The tasting was completely worth the cost and we will definitely be back!

DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I have been to this particular Johnny Rockets several times and always have had a good meal and prompt service.  That did not happen today. I walked in and sat down, had to grab a server to get a menu...She took my drink order and left, and then came back and I ordered.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and a side salad.  After waiting about 15min, my salad was finally delivered.  It was fine, but it was another 5-10 min before my sandwich came out - and it was the wrong sandwich.  They had brought me the club instead of the chicken sandwich.  When it came back, they had just taken the chicken from the club, slathered mayonnaise on a freezer burned bun, and served it to me.  The chicken was literally swimming in mayo and had the taste of bacon on it.  The bun definitely had been in the freezer too long.  After waiting for a bit longer after eating, the server came back, never asking how things were, and i paid my bill.  I will think twice about eating here again.

AHHH MAZING!  Kelly, our server, made the trip there 4 stars alone.  She was so friendly and kind and looked like she really enjoyed her job!   Since we were there during AZ restaurant week, we ordered from that menu.  For appetizers, I had the tempura, mom had the tuna and avocado poke, and dad had the bbq ribs w/sweet potato fries.  The appetizers had so much food that they could've been their own meal!  The tempura was fried crispy and included 3 big shrimp plus several vegetables.  Mom's tuna poke was melt in your mouth yummy, and dad's ribs were fall of the bone good!  After that deliciousness, the main entrees came out.  My mom and i ordered sushi...with the restaurant week menu, we had our choice of two rolls - one regular and one specialty.  I had the CA roll and the lobster roll (to die for!).  Mom had the spicy shrimp and the dynamite roll (also to die for!)..the only thing i didn't like was the eel sauce on the lobster roll, but that is just me.  Dad had the sea bass and it was delish.  Since we were celebrating my birthday, the server brought out my dessert (included in restaurant week menu) with ice cream and a candle!  I was relieved they didn't sing :).    Overall a great place, good vibe, and nice atmosphere.  I just wish they weren't so far away!

I went here for dinner with a friend last Monday night.  As usually, the food was great!  We were pleased to see their new prix-fixe for two menu and took advantage of the $40 price. With the dinner for two we got an appetizer, 2 entrees, soup, and dessert.  We had the lettuce wraps to start and my friend had egg drop soup and i had the hot and sour (the BEST!).  I had beef with broccoli and my friend had the honey chicken.  They were very very good!  To round out the dinners, we had the tiny desserts - mine tiramisu and hers lemon cake - which are just the right amount of dessert!

I have enjoyed going to vogue bistro for quite awhile, and usually the food and service are above par.  This evening was not the case.  We began with the fritto misto, which is usually a favorite.  Tonight, the calamari was chewy and rubbery, and the whole thing was so mashed together, it was difficult to find anything individually.  My salad was just meh, as was my friend's.  My friend's son ordered the steak medium, and it came out pretty rare/medium rare.  It took our server forever to come back with the check and since we were trying to get to an event, this was annoying.  For the price, the food was not up to standard.  I am not sure I will go back there.  There are plenty of other places around where I can get better for my money.

I had lunch here with my mother, and even getting there at 1:30pm, it was pretty busy!  It isn't hard to see why - their lunch plates are a steal and a very good deal at $10 for a lunch portion, rice, and soup or salad.  We ordered the fried green beans to start, which, as always, were FANTASTIC!  Mom had the lemon chicken, which was tangy and sweet and quite nice and I had the Moo-goo-gai-pan, which was yummy, but a little bland.  She had egg drop soup and I had the hot and sour, which I feel is the BEST around!  I love PF Changs and am so happy to find they are adjusting their prices!

Bernaise sliders =  YUM!!!!  I love yardhouse, and their happy hour makes it easy to try a variety of food.  My mom and I went for lunch (before happy hour) and they had nice lunch specials with a good amount of food for a reasonable price.  She had the crab cake sandwich, which she really liked, and I had - the bernaise sliders - which, as usual were FANTASTIC!  It was not very crowded, which was nice...and i love that they sell a 6oz beer.  Just enough!

The afternoon tea was FABULOUS!!!  Our servers took great care of us and even made my mom's day when they double-checked with me to ensure that yes, she really is the age I said she was.  We were celebrating my mom's birthday and I treated her to an evening stay at the Biltmore.  I must say that the AZ employee's rate is great and is what prompted us to stay! The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly!  We asked for more towels and ended up with enough for us, the neighbors and maybe the entire hotel!  A couple of downsides however -- 1.  I was expecting more luxury.  The AZ Biltmore is touted around here for being luxurious.  The stay was no more great than a stay at a Hilton (which they are owned by).  The property is old and is in a noticeable state of repair.  It needs work.  The rooms are cold and drafty, the wallpaper is peeling, and there is obvious wear and tear in the lobby.  2.  Frank and Alberts = thumbs down.  The server disappeared for many minutes at a time and only refilled my water when asked.  The food was okay, but not worth the price.  That being said, we had a wonderful stay!  If you have not been, you must go, and take the time to go to the 3rd floor and check out the history room!

Good place!!! Had the pear salad which was served in a trough and could've served everyone in the restaurant!  Was very good and thankfully the salad wasn't soggy from the warm chicken!  We had the buffalo chips and for homemade chips, they were so crispy!  I definitely will be back!

I am a regular at this restaurant, mostly for the fish fry Friday.  I went there with a bunch of colleagues from work on Wednesday to celebrate the end of school. Our server was great!  She was very attentive, and there were a lot of us, all on separate checks and all coming at different times.    The drinks were excellent and I ate the slider sampler.  YUM!!!!!  The only complaint I have is that they don't have a happy hour and the drink prices are high.

This was my first experience at Birt's Bistro.  When we got there, we decided to eat upstairs.  The service upstairs was extremely slow.  It took a while for someone to come get our drink orders, then back with our drinks, then to bring food...we got there about 1:20 and food was served at about 2pm.  I would've given them 3 stars, but the awesome food bumped them to four. Slowness aside, the food was very good.  I had the roasted veggie wrap and it had roasted hummus inside of it as well as mozzarella cheese and veggies.  It was a full wrap and almost busted through the tortilla.  It was delicious, the veggies were done just right and the hummus gave it a smoky taste.  It was served with fruit which was also good and I added an iced mocha, which could've used a bit more chocolate.  My dining partners had a chicken caesar wrap and the fish and chips.  The fish looked perfectly fried and there was an ample portion!  I would definitely go back, just probably not sit up stairs.

I LOVE this restaurant!!! The food is excellent and the servers are good.  The restaurant is divided in to two parts - the hibachi side and a table service side.  I go to both sides and have had a good time on both sides.  The one complaint that I have is that the cooks on the hibachi side, all use the same "script".  They all do the same tricks and it gets old at times.  Overall, it's a great place!

SO DISAPPOINTED!  I had been a regular at this restaurant because of the delicious food and the servers.  I went back today after a couple months away to find that they have changed owners, changed personnel, and CHANGED THEIR FOOD!  First of all, the took the professional looking menus and changed them into printed ones with spelling mistakes.  Then, they raised the prices.  The food was not as flavorful and did not have the same taste.  They got rid of my favorite mustard sauce and replaced it with shrimp sauce...not nearly as good.  Service was S..L..O..W..I almost got up and left.  The server was nice enough, but new and didn't know much..I didn't see any of the servers that used to be there.  The only plus is that they now have happy hour until 10pm throughout the restaurant... For the cost and the raised prices, I can definitely do better.  And that makes me sad.

Holy cow, I only waited a few minutes!  I did have an appt and it was 10:30, but still, this is the first time I've not waited a crazy length of time.  Great staff, knowledgeable and virtually pain free phlebotimists, and clean place!

As usual, we had a FABULOUS experience here!  We brought some "newbies" to Saigon kitchen and they had nothing but wonderful things to say!  My friends had the pho, shaken beef, and the short ribs, and I had my usual beef salad.  Super yummy!!!!  The staff is very friendly and always available if needed.  I remarked to one of my friends that they kept filling her glass while she was taking her last sip!  As always, I had the vietnamese iced coffee, which is a MUST!  So delicious!

Second time here  - had a BLAST!  The staff is so kind and helpful - I asked for an extra barstool to prop my foot on, and not only did they bring me one, they came back and made sure my foot was okay!  We painted starry night, and they are so encouraging and supportive.  I love it and I can't wait for next time!

DISAPPOINTED!!!!  I went here at 8:00 on a thursday night.  I ordered the turkey, avocado and bacon on focaccia , a cannoli, parmesan chips and water.  First of all, they were out of focaccia, so I had it on a baguette.  Then, when i got to the window, she told me they were out of cannoli so she offered me a mousse dome.  Then she came back and said they were out of that.  So I got a brownie.   The chips were stale.  Like they had been sitting out all day.  There was NO bacon on my sandwich, and the bread was tough tough tough.   I will give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe try once more, but for the price, it was definitely not worth it. One more thing...it is October 9, they were completely decorated for...CHRISTMAS!
