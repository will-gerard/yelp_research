I was planning to go to a party but it was cancelled and since I didn't have much to do on that day, I decided to try a taste of Japanese cuisine this time.  Took me awhile to find a good restaurant and later chose this one. Place is nice and has feel good vibes in it. Great for some fine food to eat. I ordered a California roll, shrimp tempura and a seaweed salad. The salad was indeed fresh and tasty but it was in small portions. The shrimp tempura was good and as for the rolls, they were delicious! It was indeed worth it every penny spent here. Might come back here and try out the other dishes they have on their menu.

I dont know why I am seeing a couple of bad reviews here because Pep Boys did me a good service. I think they had a miscommunication.  My car was a 2003 chevrolet impala, I bought this last 2007 and had a great ride with until recently. So I seeked Pep Boys for some help and they looked into my car. They're good at communicating with their customers; the charges where reasonable and it just blew me away. The  person who repaired my car was very good because he taught me a lot of things to avoid having problems with my car. He also taught me how to know if my car is already in need of repairs. After the job was done, my car went to its normal state and they satisfied me of their work. Thumbs-up for Pep Boys. Will be back again if I can experience another problem with my car.

This is already the second time that I had problems in different locations so there must be something about this place.  I ordered a mild chicken wings and I got spicy. I ordered medium stake and got well done. I waited for a while for my food. The food did not taste good at all. The only reason I came here was because of their 2 for $20 special which was all chicken--portions are mediocre! I will think again before I go back to Applebee's.

My lunch here was just okay. Only prob is that I it took so long to get the food here. Not to mention the taste level is pretty much mediocre. Probably even lower. Service here was slow, or is it because it was just my unlucky day. In short, I had a not-so-good time here.

Fantastic! This is all I can say about Jack in the box after I dined here and had that super delicious curly fries and chicken nuggets. One of the best and the most delicious nuggets that I had, I always have it it mcdonalds but I guess the taste was far superior than theirs.  This place also love by the kids so they always says that they want to come here instead on somewhere else.

The garden benedict was definitely delicious. Probably my favorite dish here in Kiss the Cook. Not only the food is great here, the place is nice and the service is great as well. The atmosphere is nice too.

Some of my friends recommended Camelback Cleaners, so I researched it on yelp. I saw a lot of negative reviews, but because I trust my friends, I tried it out. When I got there, the place is not good and there are a lot of clothes everywhere. The person in-charge said that they are having a busy day and I said that "its okay". I gave them my laundry and they gave me a reasonable charge. After a day, I came back to fetch my clothes and they siad that it was not ready yet. So I started complaining, they said that the clothes will be ready after 24 hours and then when I came there. Its not ready, and the person in-charge said that they're are having a bad day again. When they finay gave my clothes back, it's not clean the way I wanted it. It was a bad experience for me.

It was supposed like the usual average feel for me but the last time I went here, I was displeased. The fries I got were soggy and undercooked I believe. Also the buns of my burger were a bit burned, don't know how they didn't notice that or even served it to me.

My kind of place for breakfast. Food here is great and really something. Delicious and tasty. Price is reasonable and the place is neat with a cozy atmosphere. Had a grilled cheese hash brown and a Club Plate Loaded here. It was around $8.95 so it was all worth it since it was definitely delicious. Gonna try the rest of their menu soon.

It's a nice experience that I had visited this place. Excellent food, very consistent from top to end! Call staff with full attention to all the important details. The bar portion is the place where I used to settle and grab few glasses of wine or any cocktail, ideal place for business purposes.
