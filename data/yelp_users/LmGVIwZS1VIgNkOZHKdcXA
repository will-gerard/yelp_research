Charged me for items not completed...I have been fighting the charge for nearly 2 months.  Do not use this company!  They over-promise and under-deliver!

Jeremy Schachter recently Helped our family as our Mortgage Advisor.  He did a wonderful job of expediting our loan and explaining each step along the way. He is thorough, accessible, professional and very caring. We greatly appreciate his help during our home buying process

Fuego has a killer happy hour, mojitos with freshly muddled mint and great food. Try barbacoa tacos that are braised in Dr.. Pepper and ask for a side of corn along with your beans and rice.   Topping it off their wait staff is pretty great.

We stayed at this gorgeous hotel on New Year's Eve and had a great time.  The room was very large and nice - we booked a corner king room to ensure we had the large bathtub.  The bathroom was my favorite part of the hotel room.  A really cool rain shower, amazing views of the city and that bathtub was epic.    Overall a very chic feel.  So clean!  And on top of it, the staff was great, quick and very accommodating.

I would love to see this location succeed!  Really great food.  We had chicken and brisket along with a few sides.  The chicken was so very moist and really tender.  Unlike some chicken, the flavor was beyond the skin and the meat was really, really good.  The brisket was flavorful and not greasy.  Maybe just a bit dry but that did not take away from the taste.  Seasonal veggies were great, loved the fries with skins on and the baked beans were great.    A tough location with the light rail making it somewhat challenging to get into that shopping center.  Circle H is a great addition to the neighborhood.
