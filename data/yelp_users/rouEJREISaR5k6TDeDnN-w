I have been a patient of Doctor Johnstone's since approximately 04/2007.  I have seen her through thick and thin, joys and sadnesses, 2 breast lump scares, abnormal papsmears, etc.  No matter what troubles and health concerns God presented me with, Dr. Johnstone was there to calm me, lend an ear to any and all of my concerns, and to move forward with appropriate treatments.  I was overjoyed last May to learn that my husband and I were expecting our first child.  I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.  Hesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.    After I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.  My baby is due Feb 7th 2013 & I couldn't be happier I made this decision.  I could not imagine anyone other than doctor Johnstone delivering this baby.    I have read the reviews others have posted regarding not being pleased with the front desk/office staff.  I have not had that experience.  They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.    I would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.  It does not turn me off at all, and I will gladly continue driving the distance for this high quality of care (& genuine caring) in the future.

Dr. Johnstone has retired. I continued to go to Central Phoenix OBGYN as I had been going there since 2007 having found out I was pregnant with our second son 3 months after Dr. Johnstone left (03/2015).  She was really my sole reason for continuing to go to this practice as it is quite a distance from my home.    I was assigned to a new doctor.  The lady that took over for her seemed nowhere near as caring and was more concerned with training the young lady observing her in the room than with answering my questions and taking care of me.  Keep in mind, this was the 1st time I had met her. I left and did not return. I found a new OBGYN practice much closer to my home. I'm sure you're enjoying sailing around the world Dr. Johnstone. Just know that your patients surely do miss you. :-)

I went to this store to shop primarily for a bikini for a trip to Miami in January.  I was leaving the next day.  In addition, I was interested in getting a second suit (a 1 piece) for swimming lessons for my 11 month old baby.  I went into the fitting room, and the 1st suit I picked and tried on was perfect for Miami.  It was a gorgeous coral colored bikini, but there was a black mark on the back of the bottom (possibly from a hanger or something).  The sales lady hollered into the room asking how it was working out, and I explained that I loved the suit, but that there was this mark on it.  She told me she'd get another one for me and bag it up while I continued to try on suits in an attempt to find a one piece that would work for my baby's swimming lessons.  I handed her the suit over the top of the door and proceeded to try on a couple of additional suits.  I did not find another suit to purchase before baby became upset and started to cry.  I told the sales lady I was going to have to go and just purchase the single suit at this time.  I started to put my clothes back on and she asked me what size the bottom was again.  European size 10 I said.    When I emerged from the dressing room, she had the suit in a bag wrapped in tissue paper already with a sticker on top which said "Enjoy."  I couldn't wait to get to Miami Beach!  So, I arrived in Miami and it was time to hit the beach.  I put on my new suit.  It looked nothing like it did in the dressing room!  The bottom was WAY too loose!  What the heck!  The lighting must REALLY be off in that store I thought.  NOPE!  I looked at the label and the lady put a size 16 bottom in the bag instead of at size 10!!!!!!  Due to the personal nature of the product I cannot return it.  I am screwed.  AND, I could not go on the beach in Miami.  Thanks Everything But Water for ruining my vacation.

Very disappointed! I went there for the 1st time to check it out a week or so ago. The front desk office staff acted as though I was inconveniencing them to take the time to explain to me what the deal was with open gym, group classes, etc. You would think they would be eager to get new business, members, etc.   Even with that not so warm welcome, I went today with my 23-month old son to try out "open gym" with a friend of mine & her son who is a member. Same HORRIBLE treatment. The staff was devoid of personality. My son cried while he was there as it was a new place that was unfamiliar to him. The front desk people looked SO RELIEVED when we left early.   Very cool looking, fun looking place, but the staff really ruins the experience.

In reading these past reviews, I am honestly shocked about some of the negative things people have said about Dr. Webb. I agree he is difficult to get an appointment with at times, but that is because he is so highly sought after and so very good at what he does.    In fact, in order for me to get in to see him at the soonest possible appointment time, I had to say I wanted to be seen about a vaginal tightening procedure and pay $100 consultation fee just to get my foot in the door. I didn't mind even though that wasn't what I was there for at the time. I was seeking his help for a legitimate medical concern (although after talking to him about it, it may not be a bad idea to revisit that possibility after my medical issue is resolved).    I just wanted to see this fantastic doctor that I had heard great things about that people were telling me might be able to help me with a severe bleeding/cramping issue I was having following the birth of my second son.   Dr. Webb, himself, I found to be fantastic.  He is quite reserved when you first meet him.  He's quiet, but he is listening to you, evaluating your case. Determining the best course of action to take to help you.  Isn't that what you want?  I was pretty upset when I walked in the door, and Dr. Webb showed me kindness as well as patience.  I needed and appreciated both.  After you've seen him a couple of times, Dr. Webb will open up to you, smile more, and express more of his personality.   I had been around the block trying to get people to help me determine the cause of this bleeding, to get this bleeding to cease, etc.  I had been having no success.  It was Dr. Webb who finally solved that puzzle.  I was in tears from everything I had already been through with another provider that hadn't gotten me any answers (nor any better), and it was great just to hear his reassuring voice say, "We'll make you better."  I believe him.   Together, we decided that since the only true cure for my condition was a hysterectomy, that would be the path we would take.  Unfortunately my surgery was cancelled for reasons beyond Dr. Webb's control and it cannot be rescheduled until his office reaches an understanding with Honor Health as my surgery is to be performed on one of their campuses.  I am a reasonable person, and I understand that things like this do happen.  Though it is unfortunate, disappointing, & frustrating, I do not blame Dr. Webb.  As an aside, during one of my visits to Dr. Webb, he even offered to check my husband's testosterone levels and perhaps get him on some testosterone cream if he was lacking in that area. I thought that was especially nice of him to try to help us to improve our sexual health as a married couple since I had expressed to him that my desire for sexual interaction seemed much stronger than my husband's desire.  My husband would not submit to the testing process, but I still appreciated Dr. Webb making that extra effort to try to reach him.  It is difficult to get my husband to listen to and respect the opinion of anyone - even (and quite possibly especially) doctors. To listen and respond would be a true miracle.   I do agree as well with the reviewer that stated the office staff is rude on the phone.  That does happen.  They also don't really listen to you when you try to express why you're calling.  They just try to send you off as quickly as possible to whoever they can transfer you too.  The problem is, since they do not care about listening, they sometimes send you to the completely wrong person's voice mail and you have to call back and start over.  YeP.  That has happened to me too.    However, I STRESS - I thought this was a review of Dr. Webb, himself, so I'm not going to knock off an entire star of Dr. Webb's just because a young girl had a bit of attitude on the phone on a Monday morning or was distracted and incorrectly transferred me again. That doesn't seem fair to Dr. Webb.  I would not want that done to me if I were the doctor. However, having had that experience, I believe I may mention it to Dr. Webb on my next visit so that he can take the steps necessary to correct the problem.  He may not even be aware of it.  I look forward to my upcoming surgery with Dr. Webb, and I will update this review following that interaction to let you all know how it goes.  :-)

THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!!! Do not go!!! We had a GROUPON too like so many other reviewers.   1st reason not to go: Sign that said certain items on the menu could not be ordered when using a GROUPON.   2nd reason not to go: Sign that said they will automatically add an 18% tip when you use a GROUPON. That way they can give you the worst service imaginable with no consequences because they know they automatically get a good tip regardless.   3rd Reason not to go: Sign hat says they no longer accept Entertainment Book Coupons.  I would be really ticked off had I driven all the way there to use one of those coupons only to arrive and be told they are no good.   4th reason not to go: Sign that says you will be charged $1.00 extra if you use an AMEX.  What the heck? Seriously??!?   5th reason not to go: Server's appearance was not professional.  She had to be in her late 40s and had pigtails, a headband that looked like it came straight from the 80s, etc.  She looked like a little girl.  Weird.   If those reasons aren't enough, the store hours are peeling off the window & apparently aren't accurate anyway because they said they closed @ 2pm.  My friend and I arrived at 11:30am for our breakfast & we were totally RUSHED out of there.  The waitress blatantly expressed her displeasure when I ordered a refill of Diet Coke - so much so that it prompted my friend to ask, "Are you getting ready to close or something?"  The waitress said yes & that they were usually open until 1pm (Remember, the window's hours said 2pm), but that today they were closing @ noon because they had a piece of kitchen equipment out of order, & they had someone coming to fix it.  It would have been nice of her to mention we'd only be given a 1/2 hr to scarf down our food before we sat down to eat.  I was SO ANGRY!    I think she was lying about the repair person too because before I even got my newborn baby buckled into his car seat, the waitress turned out all the lights, locked the front door of the restaurant, and all but ran to her car.  She sped off.  If there really was a repair man, wouldn't she need to let him in, wouldn't he need light, etc??!?  I'm convinced she just wanted to leave early.  In conclusion, I very rarely wish ill on a family owned business as my husband and I have a small business ourselves, but I honestly hope the next time I drive by, this place will have gone out of business to save the remainder of the Phoenix Metro population from having a torturous breakfast experience.    I can't say the food was great either.  After all, I was forced to eat so quickly, I had no time to evaluate its taste.

I lived in Tempe, AZ for about 7 years & wish I still lived there some days for the sole reason that I wish it was still convenient to go to this nail salon.  Lisa & Henry are wonderful.  They are family people & I LOVED coming in for my manicures/pedicures.  When I arrived, they would greet me by name.  I have never felt more welcome in a nail salon.  Their young children were often present in the salon which may both some, but they were a joy. I even took them next door to Jack-in the Box and treated them to milkshakes one time.   When I got married, Lisa did a beautiful French manicure/pedicure for me the day before free of charge telling me it was my wedding gift.  :") How sweet is that?   I should also mention, the salon is extremely clean, the techs are focused entirely on you during your service, and the prices are super reasonable and among the best in this Sun Devil college town.   I was shocked to see a few not so great reviews on Yelp.  Please don't let that stop you from giving them a chance.  I sincerely doubt you will be disappointed.

Like so many others have mentioned, I have great memories of coming to Mary Cole's as a young child. My family often gathered there for birthdays and special events. In fact, I'm told that I was even brought there for my very first birthday though I don't remember that visit.   We most recently visited on Dec. 19th - my birthday.  We had a large party (10), and we all fit in one large booth. The waitress was super nice, let us split the bill 5 ways , and got all the orders right. Loved my peppermint chip pippin. My only complaint was that the server did not check back up on us enough. I had also ordered a Diet Coke, but my glass remained empty for quite a few minutes before we could flag her down to get me a refill.   Other than that, all else was terrific.   Love the old school 50s soda fountain feel too. Makes the place really unique.

Chandana Mishra has been my endocrinologist since 04/2007 when I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease. She has been a kind, caring, professional doctor all the while.   I have always come in once every 3 months or once every 6 months depending on what's going on in my life (i.e. more frequently when pregnant). About every 2 years they order an ultrasound of my neck to check the status of a thyroid nodule.  I also love Dr. Mishra's PA, Ashlynn, as well. In the past, Dr. Mishra has had Physician's Assistants that I would describe as far from marvelous. I would resist having to see them, & insist I wanted to see Dr. Mishra herself. With Ashlynn, I feel quite differently. It really doesn't matter to me whether I see her or Dr. Mishra herself. I am confident in her ability to manage my condition.   My only complaint with Endocrinology Associates is the front desk staff. They have had a significant rate of turnover throughout the years. They've had great people, like a guy named Joseph I remember from the Phoenix office (before they opened on Raintree). More recently, they unfortunately have had some terribly rude individuals at that desk. Very cold & unfeeling! Sometimes they have even been mean to other individuals I've watched come into and exit the waiting area while I had been waiting to be seen. Once they even made me break down in tears in front of Ashlynn when I tried to express how terribly they had treated me. It just gave me such a feeling of overwhelming disappointment because I have been such a long-time patient - basically the equivalent of a regular customer. I expected & DESERVED better (as would even a first-time visitor/new patient).  I am happy to report that since I brought this to her attention, I have been being treated better by the front desk staff. That's how it should be. I can only hope the service remains at this new level. I will continue to go there regardless of caliber of service I receive from the front desk because I love my doctor, & I only need to interact with those individuals for a very short time each visit.

I love this place! The service is always friendly and they accommodate our 2-year-old beautifully.  Servers though do seem kind of phony, but at least they are always smiling.   Food is always amazing no matter what I order. I have never been disappointed.

Service here is like no other restaurant in our area.  It's simply the best.    Food is excellent.  Seems to be authentic Chinese food to me when compared with something like P.F. Changs or other Americanized Chinese restaurants.  We most recently visited on Christmas day for lunch with the family because NOBODY else was open and our major extended family gathering was set to be at supper time.  What were we to do for lunch.  Jade Palace to the rescue.  Though we did not have reservations, we were seated right away.  Orders were taken promptly and we did not wait long for our food to arrive at our table.  It was a happy day.    Prior to our Christmas day visit, my husband and I have been there many times, ordered to go from there many times, and had taken my immediate family there once as well.  We will continue to dine @ Jade Palace regularly.  Thank you for always providing a fantastic dining experience.  No complaints - ever!

I did not like this place. I think they are trying to do too much with hair and nails under one roof.  They are fast like many have said, but you feel really rushed. THEY UP-SELL MAJOR & DO NOT LET YOU REFUSE!!!  I am talking 3rd and 4th efforts to up-sell me to purchase gel nails w my manicure.  I just came there for a regular manicure.  Finally after my tech called over a second tech to pressure me, I caved and agreed to try it.  I had tried to say no saying I was afraid they'd look fake.  I tried to refuse saying I worried they'd damage my natural nails.  Lastly, I tried to refuse saying it would take too long. They assured me none of those were valid concerns, but all my fears were realized.  :-(  I hate this place.  I won't go back.  They don't care about you.  They just want to see how far they can push you to spend.  They see dollar signs $$$$ not people.  I would encourage you to seek service elsewhere.

I am going to review this restaurant by posting a letter I sent to Oregano's management.  I have never had a more positive dining experience than I have tonight ANYWHERE.  The server was truly amazing.  I have been to this Oregano's many times as well as others and have always enjoyed it, but this time, they went above and beyond.  I encourage all Yelpers to try this pizza joint.  Their pasta and salads are also great. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  To Whom It May Concern,  I just felt it important to take the time to write regarding an amazingly positive dining experience my husband and I had this evening at the restaurant near Scottsdale & Shea.  We came into the restaurant a little bit after 9:30pm knowing you'd be closing at 10:00pm.  I was concerned we may be upsetting the staff for coming in so late when they were probably looking forward to leaving for the evening, preparing to clean up, etc.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  Our server, Scott, was phenomenal.  You are lucky to have him.  He was so welcoming, attentive, and made sure everything was perfect regarding our visit.    I should mention, we are no stranger to Oregano's.  We have been coming there for years and visited nearly every location in the valley at one time or another.  I have also celebrated many a birthday there.  I just wanted to say that the service from Scott tonight was the best service I think I've ever had at ANY Oregano's or any other restaurant for that matter.  You are lucky to have him on your staff.  It is my hope that you will not lose him one day to Mastro's or something.    Amazing service made our ordinary night extraordinary & when I finish here, I am going to write a terrific review on YELP.  Keep up the great work you do . . . oh yeah . . . & give Scott a bonus or something, would ya???  ;-)    With Sincere Appreciation,  Kate S.

Went back to Oregano's with a friend yesterday.  Service was outstanding as usual.  Upon leaving the restaurant, our server, Lindsay, could see I was moving at a snail's pace trying to carry my 11 week old baby in his carrier out to my car.  You see, my baby and I were rear-ended a few weeks ago and I have a sprained/strained cervical and lumbar spine respectively along with a sprained knee, and was truthfully having great difficulty.  She offered to carry my baby in his carrier all the way out to my car for me.  I felt kind of guilty accepting her offer, but upon her insistence I did.  She even lifted him into the back seat of the car for me.  This is just another example of the kind of people you have on your extremely caring staff!!  Thank you SO MUCH!!!

I love this place!  I just went on 02/11 most recently for my friend's birthday & they gave here a free Ice Cream Sunday which was a nice touch, but I've never ordered anything I haven't liked there.    Their hot dogs are amazing as well as their turkey burgers and their salads.  Their sweet potato fries are to die for yummy and the fries are served in a cute shopping cart.    This place is also open really late so it makes it a great spot to go for the late night munchies or if you just got home on a late flight and are headed back up to the north valley on your way home.

I should have written this review a long time ago as my contact with Vetmed was in 10/2014 when my 14-year-old cat, Stripes, fell ill. He had both kidney and thyroid issues, and his regular vet had left us no other option but to put him to sleep.   The vet we met with took the time to thoroughly evaluate Stripes. She did give us an option for treatment though she thought his chances of survival were somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10%.  It was going to cost between about $1,500 to $2,000 per day to try to treat Stripes and keep him alive.    I appreciated their kindness and their willingness to do whatever it would take at my request to try to save my baby, but after one last conversation with him and determining how much he was suffering, I weighed the options and made the ever-difficult decision to humanely euthanize him and end his suffering.  I do think for what we ended up deciding to ultimately do, the cost was still extremely high which is the only reason I am giving 4 stars rather than the full 5.

Let me begin by saying, I am well travelled. My husband and I have homes in both Scottsdale, AZ  and in San Diego's Little Italy.  We also visit multiple cities around the US for business and pleasure each year.  That said, I have had the opportunity to have pedicures in multiple cities over the course of the last 3 years and to visit high end resorts/spas, pregnancy spas, as well as your more typical (& much easier to come by) Vietnamese nail salons.    I have had great experiences, terrible ones, and everything in between. I just had a baby 2 & 1/2 months ago and it had been over a month since my last pedi.  (Quite frankly, I was embarrassed to have the Allure nail tech see my feet.). My mom agreed to watch my baby while I went out for a few hours to run some errands.  After picking up my dry cleaning, I noticed this salon in the same plaza.    Upon walking in, I was promptly greeted by a US born American, Russ, who was super friendly & welcomed me right away.  This was a nice treat for me because one of the things that often frustrates me when going to these Vietnamese salons is that there is all too often a language barrier.  It was nice to be understood right away as to what I was asking for.   I decided to go for the gusto & have their best pedicure ( "luxury pedicure") which was $55.00. I was brought to a chair right away, and introduced to Richie (my tech).  Since it was already 6:30pm when I arrived, I asked him if there was time for him to do the luxury pedi as I did not want to keep him too late. He replied, "No problem Katherine I take care of you."    The massage chair was standard, the salon was clean, and it was evident the techs do care about their customers.  In fact, while I was there, they were all passing around a "thinking of you" card for someone that they had everyone sign.   The best part of the whole experience was the massage, it was both lengthy & luxurious as Richie applied significant pressure.  FELT AWESOME! Such strong hands.  I can't stand it that @ a lot of salons they simply rub lotion on your feet and call it a massage.  I really feel cheated when that happens.    Another super plus about Allure was that I can honestly say that Richie did not attempt to up-sell me once which is something I genuinely appreciated.  I can't stand it when they want to upgrade you to gel nails, add a flower, etc.   Well, I didn't end up getting out of there until 7:45pm, but Richie & Russ both stayed late for me with no complaints. I felt valued as a person & a customer which is hard to find these days. I will return to Allure nails FoR SuRe the next time I need a pedicure or manicure. :-)

HONEST EMPLOYEE noticed a vehicle hit our car in the parking lot and take off, but Mr. Danny Baker wrote down the license plate number for us.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!  Can't wait to buy the mattress for our master bedroom from you as soon as our new house is finished.

We love coming here for breakfast.  They have excellent soy chorizo and egg burritos.  I get mine w/ egg whites and no cheese on a spinach tortilla. SO DELICIOUS!  My husband loves to order the same and usually a bowl of their oatmeal. Our 3-year-old loves their bowls of berries.   Our only complains are that there is not a large enough dining area and there are only 2 high chairs to go around so we have learned to always be sure to bring our baby in his stroller even though there is really not room due to the limited space because the likelihood of scoring a high chair is slim to none. ;-)

Our room:The furniture was a very dark color which made the multiple chips in each and every piece of furniture stand out.  Next, I walked into the bathroom.  The shower was pretty ugly.  Old stained tile, worn drain, very simple faucet/shower head.  Definitely nothing special.  Then, I walked to the sink to check out the soap & other goodies that were provided and noticed a hair in the sink.  Ick!  Whatever . . . Moved on to the bathtub. Multiple pieces of hair in the tub!!!  Gross!!! Had to use the facilities & noticed yet another hair on the floor next to the toilet.  Either housekeeping is too rushed or just doesn't care.    At that point, we called the front desk to get another room.  This time we got an upgrade to a larger room.  When I looked in the bathroom of the new room, another hair (very long, dark hair) was sitting on the towel layed across the oversized bathtub.  The soap was placed on top of the hair so it was sandwiched between the towel and box of soap.  Did not bother to call and complain again, but did not use that towel, that soap, or that bathtub during our 2 night stay. We saw the Peep Show starring Coco Austin. My husband and I liked the music.  I'm a big Coco fan so enjoyed seeing her, but the story-line is kind of cheesy & doesn't make much sense.  We saw the show previously when Holly Madison starred and it was completely unchanged years later.  I think they could stand to update it a bit.  The restaurants/bars: Ate at YoLo's, Planet Dailies, and the buffet.  Food was ok.  I'd give it 3 stars across the board for the food itself.  The prices were pretty high for what you get.  For example, a simple Reuben is like $13. That seems inexpensive however when you compare it to prices at the pool bar where my husband's Bacardi Diet Coke was $15.   Speaking of the pool, there are 2 pools which have a very simple shape. Nothing special about them.  They are holes in the ground filled with water.  Even the Flamingo has a nicer pool.  I would also recommend Caesar's, the Mirage, or the Cosmopolitan pools over this one.    The spa:Not worth purchasing a day pass because there isn't much in there. It's old and the them is obviously left over from when this hotel was the Aladin.  This theme no longer fits this hotel.  The services do not follow the theme either like I have seen them do at many other Vegas spas.  Services are WaY Overpriced!!!!  Even for a Vegas spa.  Believe me, I have been to Qua @ Caesars & this is nowhere near as nice, but they still charge over $200 for a facial.  AnD . . . You are paying that much and the staff acts like they couldn't care less that you are there.  other than the "nameste" greeting you receive when you walk in the door, they do not make any effort to make you feel appreciated, special, etc.    Facial itself was excellent, but I was asked if I'd like to have microdermabrasion and glycolic application during my facial.  I said, "sure."  Next, she tells me it was going to be a $20 upgrade charge.  She asked if that would be alright.  I agreed because I was using comps anyway and already spending over $200 as it was so what's another $20, right?  Well, when I went to check out, the guy @ the front desk said the upgrade was $25.  I explained to him I was quoted $20, but he insisted it was $25 & that I had already had the treatment and that I would need to pay for it.  I tried fighting him on it one more time but to no avail.   We came to this hotel with the intention of using our $1000 comp dollars so we charged everything to the room.  Our final bill for 2 days was $644.  My husband checked out while I was finishing up at the spa.  They told him our comps covered all except $103 of our bill.  They charged our credit card the remaining amount!!!!  What?!?  We should have had more than enough comps.  So, my husband tells me this when I get out of the spa as we are driving away from the hotel.  I couldn't believe it and immediately called to try to resolve this.  The lady on the phone said the same thing . . .   All comps on both our players club cards had been used.  I could not believe this.  So, once we flew home, I looked online today and I still had $430 left in comps on my card!!!  What kind of idiots do they have working there?!?!  So, I called again TODAY and finally got someone who saw the comps and agreed to refund the amount charged to the credit card and instead take the $103 out of my comps.    Such a stressful trip there was more frustration than fun.  My advice would be not to go to Planet Hollywood unless you want to be surrounded by a staff who doesn't give a shit that you are there from the valets to the bellmen to the waiters to the dealers.  They really don't care about you which is unfortunate since you are forking out a lot of money overpaying for subpar quality everything.  You would think that would at least buy you a little respect.

This place's food is GOOD . . . REALLY GOOD.  There is nothing that I have ordered there that I have not liked.  It is also convenient for us as it's about 2 miles from our home.  HOWEVER, the service is NEVER GOOD.  I have eaten there with my husband 3 times.  The 1st time, we ate there kind of late.  We were among 3 or 4 tables of people left in the place.  The waitress seemed tired and didn't really seem to care that we were there.  She was far from friendly and the service was far from marvelous.  It took longer than I feel it should to get our food.  The second time we ate there, we sat in the bar area.  The bartender/server was eventually friendly this time, but only by the point we were about to leave.  In the beginning she didn't seem to care much and was just kind of blah.  I think maybe she warmed up because they got my order wrong.  I don't like refried beans so I asked if I could have a double rice portion instead of rice and beans.  When I ordered, the server said that was fine, but my plate came with beans and rice anyway.  She did offer to take the whole thing back and fix it, but I was so hungry, I just kept the plate.  Again, it takes quite a while to get your food whether they are busy or not.  The 3rd time we were there was last night (my husband, our baby, and a friend of mine).  They messed up my order AGAIN.  This time I had asked for tamales with no cheese over the top of them.  It came with cheese on the top.   This time, I was so frustrated, I didn't even bother to bring it up to the server and she didn't even notice it was wrong.  If she would have, with her attitude I doubt she would have genuinely cared anyway.  Again, it takes so long to get your food out at this restaurant when it's slow that I just sucked it up and ate it anyway as this was a Friday night and BUSY.  The server again was blah.  Not bad, but not friendly.  In conclusion, this restaurant could greatly improve its Yelp reviews if they would make an effort to make people feel appreciated and welcome.  The staff needs a lesson in customer service and they need to get a good flow of positive energy going.    THEY ALSO NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT GETTING THEIR ORDERS CORRECT!!!  LIKE I SAID, I HAVE EATEN THERE 3 TIMES AND MY ORDER WAS WRONG TWICE.  To me, that is not acceptable.  I sincerely hope someone from management there reads this so that they can fix it because the atmosphere there as well as the food is good.  That's why I gave them 3 chances despite my past experiences.  Sorry, guys - 3 strikes - YOU'RE OUT!!!

Lorenzo's should be ASHAMED of themselves!!!  I am pregnant expecting baby any day now so I thought I would make lunch easy and have some pizza delivered.  I didn't want to go on the cheap with something like Domino's (though hindsight being 20/20 I probably should have) so I ordered from a local small business, Lorenzo's on Pinnacle Peak & Scottsdale in Scottsdale.  It should be noted that our Scottsdale home is on Pinnacle Peak and Pima (only 2 miles away).    I placed my order @ 1:58pm.  An hour passed and my pizza had not arrived.  I had not received a follow-up phone call or anything so I phoned Lorenzo's back at 3:00pm and quite politely informed them that the pizza had not yet arrived told them I was just calling to check on it.  There was no apology or explanation given.  I was just told it would be arriving with in 10 minutes.  By this point my husband, who had planned to share the pizza, had to leave the house for his afternoon business appointment so he didn't even get to have any of the pizza after all of this!!!  Finally, it arrived at 3:23pm.  It took them over 20 minutes more and when the driver arrived, again there was no explanation offered, no apology, no offer of a discount or anything.  I did not ask for anything from the driver as I was starving, the pizza was there, and the pizza was hot.  I did however give him a lesser tip than I would normally give a driver though I realize it was likely not his fault.  The fact that the pizza was still extremely warm makes me believe they probably totally forgot my order and just put it in when I called to check on it an hour after ordering.    Needless to say, I will not be ordering from them again.  They could have easily somewhat redeemed themselves in my mind by even just an apology, but none was received.  They SucK!  The pizza was not bad though it was far from marvelous and spoiled by my extreme displeasure regarding the circumstances and timing of its delivery.  P.S.  This was today!!  It's Tuesday afternoon!  It's not even peak lunch or dinner time and on a weekday when they are not even busy.  There is no excuse.   It's not like this happened on Friday or Saturday night during dinner time or something.

Okay, so it had been a while and I decided to give this place 1 more chance.  After all, they are one of VERY FEW places nearby that will deliver to my home and with a nearly 6 month old infant, going out to lunch is tough!  I wanted it to be worth the delivering, tip, etc so I figured I'd go large and on the phone asked for a 2 foot long chicken hero.  The lady on the phone acted like she didn't know what I was talking about and so I read it to her from the menu they have posted online on their website. Then, she tells me I can't order that because it has to be ordered well in advance since it's on their "catering menu".  It does not mention any advance notice required on the menu btw.  I just went back and read it again to make sure.    Anyway, that wasn't too big of a deal.  I proceeded to modify my order. . . so next I tell her I'd like a regular chicken hero.  Before, I could move on to the next item she cuts me off and tells me I can't do delivery because that price was below the minimum for delivery.  She was no starting to tick me off.  "WELL I WASN'T FINISHED YETTTT!!!" I said.  "Oh, OKAY, " she replied.  Just then, I began to tell her the salad I wanted to add to my order and stopped mid-sentence.  Instead, I exclaimed, "You know what.  I think you're very rude, and I don't want to order from you."    As I hung up the phone, I heard her screaming, "I'M RUDE?!?!?!"  Yes HONEY, you are.  I'm finished with you.  I will not again give you my business.  I will order from a neighboring restaurant instead.

Lorenzo's has much improved!  I have ordered delivery from them again multiple times simply because there is NOWHERE else in the area to get pizza delivery from that isn't a cheap pizza chain, and we wanted some better quality pizza for workers that were doing construction, handyman, stereo, television, etc work on our new home we moved into in November.  They have delivered much faster, and in fact once I was told they actually put my order in front of someone who called sooner because it was a larger order and would have unnecessarily delayed mine.  Great job Lorenzos!  Also, we tried dining in as a family 2 or 3 times.  One of the times there was a Gila monster right outside the door which was exiting.  Service was great.  They were very accommodating with our baby.  We are taking out of town company there tonight.  Didn't give 5 full stars because they are still rude when they answer the phone sometimes - especially one girl in particular that has an attitude, but that's the only think left that I think they really could work on to improve service.  :-)

This was nothing short of an outrage.  It wasn't the food, but rather the service that left a bitter taste in my mouth.  I walked into the deli with a family of 7 walking in just ahead of me (they held the door for me in fact).  They have 2 registers @ this deli (one on either side of the counter). Both had a single customer at them, next in line was the large family, and then there was me.   Both registers completed the orders with their single guests. I stood behind the large family for 2 or 3 minutes as they were really indecisive, it was the 1st time they'd been here for some of them, etc.  Neither of the cashiers bothered to call me forward to either open register. They both just stood there waiting for the large family? What the...... ?    Finally, getting frustrated and perturbed, I stepped forward and asked the matriarch of the family if it would be alright if I went ahead explaining that all I wanted was 2 bagels to go. How ridiculous that I'm just standing there waiting with 2 people available to help me.  They made no effort to do so.  She said that was totally fine so I approached one of the registers.   The little twerp looked annoyed with me from the get-go. It was like I was inconveniencing him trying to order something from this deli.  I felt as though he would rather have not bothered with me, and that he would have been more content with an empty register so that h could carry on a conversation with the other employees.  Anyway, I order 2 bagels to go. Not difficult. I give him the first bagel order. Next I ordered the second.  "You wanted it scooped, right, " he asked me.  "What?" I asked.  "I'm not sure what you said."  He repeated, "Did you want that scooped?"  I explained that I did not know what that meant.   Next, this idiot says, "But you asked for the first one scooped, right?" Again, I explained to him that I had never even heard that term before so how could I have asked for that.  Looking increasing annoyed, instead of asking me if I'd like something to drink, he just pointed @ the beverage cups.  What an asshole!!!    If all of this isn't enough, after I paid him with my credit card, instead of saying thank you and handing me back my card, he just tossed my card down on the counter in front of me to give it back.  I couldn't even believe the mistreatment.   I would not ever go here.  There are other family owned bagel shops that appreciate a person's patronage. :"(

I have to call 'um like I see 'um, and though I don't particularly like writing negative reviews, this place has failed me once again!!!  My husband and I just got finished taking our 6 month old baby to the pediatric eye doctor which happens to be located only one mile south of J.J.'s.  It was an early morning 8:00am appointment so we didn't have time for breakfast prior to the appointment.  Since we were hungry when we got out, it was too convenient not to give J.J.'s another chance.    This time, we walked in the door and nobody else was there.  I got a different cashier (fortunately) who was courteous (added one star for this guy).  The trouble came when our order was ready.  My husband loves to sit outside @ restaurants - especially in the mornings.  In fact, he was already out there while I was still inside waiting for our order.  Our order when ready was brought out by . . . guess who????  YEP - that little twerp who was so rude to me on my last visit!!!    The guy asked me where we'd like to sit.  I replied, "Outside please.  My husband is already out there."  Instead of just complying and bringing our order outside to where my husband was waiting, he says to me, "Are you sure???  It's REALLY hot out there and there are TONs of flies."    WHAT THE HECK???   It's only 9:00am and 90 degrees out.  Granted it's not the coolest of temperatures, but in the shade we would have been fine.  FLIES????  I'm thinking to myself, "Why do you even have a patio then, if it's so terrible for people to sit there?!?!?!?"  I didn't really know how to respond to that.  Finally, I decided not to fight him further on that and I was standing near the soda machine and refrigerator that holds the bottled beverages so I just asked him to set it down on that table closest to me telling him I guess my husband would have to come back in eventually (once we never appeared outside.  LOL).    So, I fill my fountain drink and go to sit down when **BANG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  The same idiot had opened the bottled beverage refrigerator and carelessly knocked a bottle off the shelf shattering it within a few feet of us.  I noticed some glass in the lower basket part of our stroller (WHICH MY BABY WAS SITTING IN @ THE TIME).  I was so worried the baby could have been cut or that some glass may have gotten into the upper part of the stroller.  Luckily, he was alright and since he was facing the other direction, was not harmed.    YEP . . . I think I'm finished with this place.  Too bad, because the bagels aren't bad. . . just that employee.

I really, really, really, like their food.  The spring rolls and Pad Thai are amazing.  I used to get delivery to my house regularly because they are only 1 mile away and delivery was free.  Now though disappointingly, they are not offering delivery though they still have a big sign on their front window that says "We deliver" which I think they should remove.  I called on New Year's Eve wanting delivery and when they said they did not have delivery @ the moment I asked if it was because it was New Year's Eve.  They replied, "No, delivery driver quit."  I just ordered from them again last Sunday, but when I called in, apparently they haven't gotten a new one yet because they said they still couldn't deliver.  Yet, when I arrived @ the restaurant to pick up my order, the "We deliver," sign was still up. ????  I have never eaten in at this place.  I've only gotten take out.  I will continue to order from them because it's the best Thai food and closest Thai food nearby.  YuM!!  Would definitely recommend though I obviously miss the handy delivery option.  It was just SO EASY.

I did not have a positive experience with this store today.  I called before coming in because I am 9 months pregnant and didn't want the hassle of parking @ Scottsdale Quarter for nothing so I wanted to make sure I could accomplish my mission ahead of time.    When I called, I spoke to a lady named Diane on the phone.  She seemed friendly and helpful.  I asked her if she matched competitor's coupons as I was interested in a VIPP diaper pail which was quite pricey ($319.00), and I'd shopped around quite a bit for it.  Same price on Amazon, Buy Buy Baby, Giggle, not available on eBay, etc.  It was the same price everywhere available so the best deal I was going to get appeared to be @ Buy Buy Baby with a 20% off coupon.  The thing is that Buy Buy Baby didn't have any in their stores so I would have to physically drive down to Buy Buy Baby in order to use my coupon which was "good in store only" and could not be used to order online.  Then, I would have to have a store employee order the item for me from inside the store where I would present my coupon and they would have it shipped to my home so I would still need to pay a substantial shipping charge.  So, when I called Giggle, Diane told me that they did not accept the coupon, but that they were having a 20% off sale at the moment which just happened to include the item I wanted.  She said that I could come in and purchase the floor model or order a new one and that I would not have to pay the shipping.  This sounded good to me and like less of a hassle than Buy Buy Baby & I could leave with the physical item today.  The floor model was white which is the color I wanted so I rushed on down to the store.  Diane stated she hoped she'd be there when I arrived, but if not she'd leave a note with the information and my name for whoever relieved her.  When I arrived at the Giggle store, Diane had already left.  I introduced the myself to the lady behind the counter.  She told me her name was Patty.  Patty seemed to be expecting me and had my name written down at the desk.  She showed me the floor model.  I was so disappointed to find that the white floor model had a black scratch across it which was at least 2 inches in length.  I thought this should have been divulged prior to my visit.  Because of this, I asked Patty to please order me a new one telling her that I didn't want to spend that kind of money on an item which had a scratch.  Contrary to what Diane had told me, Patty said they could not order the item and give me the 20% off.  She said since the item was over $75.00, the shipping would be free, but I couldn't get any discount.  This was quite upsetting to me.  Next she told me they did have one more in stock in the back storage room, but that it was red.  I agreed to take that one because red is an accent color in our nursery and I appeared to be between a rock and a hard place so to speak.  She did not seem eager to go get it for me so I could check it out or even purchase it.  She got it out of the back room, and after inspection, I agreed to purchase that one.  The whole time she was not very friendly.    After I paid, she did offer to wheel the item out to my car with a dolly to load it for me since it was extremely heavy (stainless steel inside).  I had to go get my car out of the garage, pull in around to a loading zone and call them to put it in the car.  When I called someone else answered and that lady ended up bringing it out to the car.  She was equally inexpressive and didn't seem friendly.  She didn't seem like she really appreciated my business either.  Oh well.  At least I still got the best deal possible on the item which makes my husband happy & we didn't have to return later to the store for him to load it in the car due to the weight either which makes us both happy.    After this experience, though they were not blatantly terrible, I don't think I'll bother going back if I can help it.  The conflicting information I was given was annoying and disappointing and the BLAUGH employees further cemented my decision to stay away in the future.  There are plenty of other places to go for baby items.

My husband and I ate here for the first time last night.  We had set out to try the new Which Wich restaurant in the same plaza, but since that place was already closed and it was after 8:30pm, we walked into this place.  The did not pay attention to us when we sat out on the patio.  Nobody came around to our table at all so after about 5 minutes we went inside.  This was kind of inconvenient because we were carrying around our 11 week old baby in his carrier too, but we repositioned ourselves at a table inside.  The server came over and asked to take our drink orders, but he didn't really greet us at all.  He was not very friendly.  No small talk either.  He was down to business.  It wasn't really even that busy.    My husband had a Diet Coke to drink, but it tasted ultra syrupy.  It must have been served out of the bar hose.  I just had water which was a mistake.  It tasted like Chlorine.  My husband hollered to the waiter who appeared to be in earshot, "Excuse me!  Could we please get a bottled water?!?!?"  He didn't even turn around nor acknowledge him.  Finally, when he came back to our table to take our order, we asked him for one, but they don't have bottled water.  :"(    Next we ordered the food.  We liked our food.   My husband was really impressed with his "Build Your Own Burger."  I had a Vegetable Salad which was really good.  The dressing was especially excellent.  It took a while to get our food out, but we really didn't mind because we were distracted by all of the televisions.  This was another plus.  The L.A. Lakers vs San Antonio Spurs playoff game was on.    To summarize, this place really would have gotten more stars had the service been better.  However, it was nothing special compared to the other options North Scottsdale has to offer.  We may be back, but I doubt it.  Probably only if every other desirable option has already closed.

Not much has changed.  This place still pretty much stinks.  The only things I like here are the sweet potato tots and the Diet Coke.  THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL!!!! DO NOT EXPECT ANY ATTENTION TO BE PAID TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT FEEL THE SLIGHTEST BIT IMPORTANT.  YOUR ORDER WILL LIKELY BE WRONG!!!    My husband asked for a turkey burger with no garlic whatever sauce on it.  Of course, it came with it on it. They apologized.  Then instead of just making him a new burger, they told us they were just going to throw it back on the grill and that sauce would melt right back off.  ?????  They said it would take about 10 minutes.  WHAT?!?!?  Wouldn't you think the meat would be too tough after 10 extra minutes on the grill?  To make things worse while we were waiting, some dude (likely the manager) came up to our table and asked if either of us drove a Ford truck.  "NO, I DRIVE A 7SERIES BMW.  DO I LOOK LIKE A DRIVE A FORD TRUCK?  WHY?"  He walked away without answering.  It was because a Ford truck was parked in their 15 minute only to go parking spot we figured out.    So I had already finished my chicken Caesar salad, no turkey burger for my husband yet. I'm still hungry because my salad was pathetically small for an entree salad and he's starving because he still has no food.  I look back behind me several times trying to spot the waitress to get her attention.  Finally I have to get up and walk to the frick'n hostess stand to order my 1/2 sweet tots 1/2 french fry because she's just standing there talking to the guy who had nothing better to to 10 minutes ago than walk around asking people if they owned Ford trucks.   Anyway, the whole lunch experience took about 2 hours.  TOO LONG.  TOO ANNOYING. WILL NOT BE BACK.

This place is an amazing solution for parents needing a place to leave their children for just a couple of hours for the children to expend some energy, for parents to run to a doctor's appointment, to get a quick haircut, etc.   The staff is always friendly, knows my son by name, and is always extremely welcoming anytime we stop by to play despite his special needs.  Admittedly, he can be a handful at times.   I'd like to extend special thanks to Maddie who has gone above and beyond the call of duty and had to search the play area for my child's "comfort item" that he has brought with him multiple times and unfortunately misplaced after discovering all of the other exciting play opportunities Daydreams has to offer.  Maddie has even run his comfort item out to the car for us.    Ms. Deana is fantastic. She is loving, kind, and accepting of all. Ever since the first day I stopped by as a nervous first-time mom to tour the facility, she was patient with all of my questions, and answered each of them with a smile in her voice and her eyes as well as the beautiful smile that is never missing from her face.    The play area is always extremely clean.  They take care not to allow sick children (i.e. with fevers) to be dropped off so as not to infect other kids.   Thank you Daydreams for opening up my world again. . .or allowing me to once again take part in what used to be missed opportunities.  We sincerely appreciate all you do for us.  We can't wait until our 6-month-old is old enough to come play with you as well.

Really fun atmosphere for a fast food counter service kind of place w/ a drive through.  Jumbo hot dogs are super yummy, service is always great, employees are courteous, etc.  The only thing I think sucks is that these super nice employees are forced to stand out in the AZ heat to take the drive through orders.  What happened to the old fashioned speaker systems.  I feel so sorry for them.  I think that is really stupid and sad.  They say it gets orders processed and out quicker, but I don't see how it could really make that much of a difference.  I wish they would change their policy on this.  They are out there even when it's not super busy for no apparent reason.

This place kind of sucks.  The ladies at the counter both times I was there seem to be impatiently waiting for you to figure out what you want and order.   This place is new so we needed time to decide.    I ordered the chicken kabobs the first time we were there.  It was very salty and I didn't care for the rice or the greek salad.  The second time I ate there I had a chicken pita which annoyed them that I ordered that way since there are so many types of chicken on the menu that could apparently be made into a pita.  The pita bread was really good so I'll give them that, but we gave them 2 tries and didn't like it much either time so I doubt will be back.    Bummer . . . we were hoping to be impressed.

We LOVE FOX restaurants in general, but it's nice that they have this Mexican restaurant thrown into the mix of their usual Italian, Steakhouses, etc.  The food here is SO GOOD!  Service is usually really good too.  Sometimes, we'll get an average server which is why didn't give the FULL 5 stars, but this is definitely a must visit!!!  The atmosphere is great with a nice patio.  It's not too awful casual in that it feels like you're dining at a pretty nice restaurant yet you could still get away with walking in in your nicer work-out attire (which I have).

I walked into this "learning center" the other day thinking I'd check it out to see whether it might have activities our 3-year-old could participate in perhaps.  He is autistic and sees a developmental pediatrician on one side of Kids Inc Learning Center and we are members of the We Rock the Spectrum Kid's Gym on the other side of Kids Inc Learning Center.  Since this place is right smack in between them, I didn't think it was an odd thing to be going in to investigate or be asking about. Perhaps I'm not the first parent of a special needs child who has though because when I went in and explained this to the lady at the front desk and asked what her facility was all about, she seemed immediately annoyed and just flat out told me that they were a traditional "enrollment" daycare and that they "did not accept" special needs kids.  WoW!  It felt VERY COLD to me. "OOOOKAY," I answered in a state of shock and disbelief.  I don't know if I was more shocked that they didn't take special needs kids because they were missing out on so much business due to where they were located or due to the cold manner in which she seemed to be staring at me completely uninterested in my business, in any further communication with me, and very obviously just wanted me to leave her company as soon as humanly possible.   I would have given it only 1 star, but I have to at least give the place credit in that it was extremely cool looking.  If I were a young child, it would have looked very appealing with a large life-like tree at the entrance, jungle animals, etc.  It just looked like a fun place to be. Also, from what I could see, it appeared quite clean though it was OBVIOUS there was no way I was going to be offered a tour.  **sigh** What a shame.

I really enjoyed eating at Kale and Clover.  My husband has recently decided that he's trying to eat a vegan diet, and this restaurant offers several choices for him that he enjoys. I loved what I had each time I've eaten there, and our 3-year-old was even able to find something on the menu that he ACTUALLY ATE which is a rarity at most restaurants.  The service was courteous, and our special order item was made correctly.
