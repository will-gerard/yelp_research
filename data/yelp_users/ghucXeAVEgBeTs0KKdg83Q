We were basically pushed out of the restaurant because we had kids. The hostess was rude and I was excited to try this place but I won't ever be back due to the way I was treated tonight when I walked in with my kids. Horrible.

THis place has great wings and its a cool hole in the wall type feel.  You can tell this place has its regulars as the servers knew people by name.  I will definitely be back for more wings and cocktails!!

They couldnt tell that I had cysts on my ultrasound, thought they were ectopic pregnancies... really?!  They put me in an office told me I needed to go right to the ER or I could die.  uhmmmmmm what?  So I listened, even with no insurance and went and ER was in shock that PP thought it was eggs. They were clearly cysts and I have to pay out of pocket for this hospital bill.

This company broke our flat screen.  The movers seemed like they were tweaked out on drugs.  NO THANKS... the owners were rude and we will never use this company again.  I will be sure my friends hear about our experience.

Friendly service greatest NY style pizza in the area. They know you by name and treat you like family.  Definitely the closest feel to the east coast out here in az. I will forever be coming here.

Erik did a wonderful job on my boyfriends water heater replacement. He was very quick to help us out and very pleasant to work with. He also has competitive prices and got the job don't efficient and with quality. I will be recommending him to anyone I know who needs a plumber. Thanks again!!

My husband and I went for dinner the other night and there was just one woman working.  We ordered water for drinks and after sitting there for 20 mins waiting we decided to take off.  Really really bad customer service.

They took an hour and a half to deliver my take out. The chicken was dry and I just was overall not happy. I called to ask where my food was they said sorry but should've comped something. Also I orders a small order of crab wontons they gave me the larger and charged me for the larger. Not happy food was poor quality and I won't be going back.

Awesome food and amazing bruschetta boards. I don't recommend the cheese board we didn't like that but everything else we have had has been great.

Jake was very quick and took care of my phone right Away. It looks like brand new. They have very reasonable prices and treat you like family. I highly recommend if you need a phone iPad etc screen repair.
