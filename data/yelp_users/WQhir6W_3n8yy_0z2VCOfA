Best Happy Hour, by far.  I haven't yet tried dinner, but the appetizers and pizza are delicious and the staff are very friendly.

This place brings me back to my childhood when going out to a fancy dinner meant the local Chinese place. It's got the no frills classic Chinese style, as it should be. I am happy they are keeping it old school and not giving into the peer pressures to be fancy. Good classic Chinese food that is pretty good to be honest. Bring the whole family and create fond memories for your kids too!

I have finally discovered what my last meal choice would be if I had to choose. It would be the scallops on the appetizer menu at House of Tricks. It will be very hard for me to NOT come and eat them every night of the week! Good job! My only wish is that there were 4 instead of only 2... :)

I hate to be a jerk, but I am not a fan. When I think Mexican food I envision spicy food that makes my nose run and bold flavors that dance along my tongue...unfortunately my dreams were crushed at Tia Rosa. So, with that said. If you have super bland taste (which there is nothing wrong with that), or love sweet sugary syrup on your tacos, then this is the place for you. If not, stay away.

I have never had anything I didn't like and I dream about their bakery items often. Just talking about it makes me drool. Mmmmmmm....

I've been to quite a few Thai places in the valley, and this one wins as #1! The place is clean, the people are nice, and the food is delicious! I also love that when I ask for spicy, it really is spicy and they aren't just humoring me.

If you enjoy bartenders that are in a bad mood, and people watching than this place is a great choice! The only redeeming quality is it has an outdoor bar and the beer is cold.

Z-Cafe has turned what could be considered just another boring sandwich into something amazing and FAR from boring! I never even realized how fancy macaroni salad could be until I met this place. I love that the go to sandwich option is now more like a special occasion I need to find an excuse to celebrate often. So glad I found you!!

Nothing helps melt away the stresses of the day or even a long week like the La Bocca bruschetta planks. With every bite of the smoked prosciuotto & fig, pulled pork & pesto and roasted garlic & goat cheese, anything on my mind instantly takes a back seat to the savory enjoyment of every flavor packed nibble I take.

I love trying new sushi places but it's always hit or miss on whether or not the sushi is fishy. I always know that when I order from here it will be excellent. This is my go to when I want yummy sushi and I am not in the mood to take a chance on it not meeting my expectations.

If you love spicy food then you'll like this place.  It was super yummy and just spicy enough to make my nose run without crossing over into uncomfortable to eat. It's got a romantic vibe at night making it a perfect choice for a date.  I will definitely be back!

Outdoor bar. HUGE selling point. Luckily, the food is great and the staff is friendly. They are new, so hopefully people will be more understanding of that...I notice a lot of complaints about the service. I personally did not have a problem, but we sat at the bar.

The bowls are very delicious and refreshing. Plus, I don't feel bad about myself afterwards like I do when I eat ice cream.

Discovered this place at my son's school carnival! Not only do I love local businesses that are involved in the community, but man do they make a good taco! It's so simple yet so delicious! We tried them out at their place and it's got a great local vibe as well. Definitely found my new taco shop.

This place is adorable! It has a great atmosphere that is inviting and friendly. I love that you can come in here, have a few cocktails and feel comfortable and welcome. The food is good and you can tell that the owners really appreciate your business which I love when I visit local places. Definitely a must try.

For an area that is lacking in dining out options, especially for breakfast, I am happy to have sunnyside cafe. They are fast and friendly and I love the chorizo Benedict! I Hope they stick around so I encourage everyone to support our local Mesa businesses!

Best place in East Mesa to grab a pint, enjoy some good music, good conversation and good bar food. You feel very welcome to sit back and just hang out awhile, this is definitely the new neighborhood hangout. I know this place has changed quite a few times, but I hope this one sticks around because it seems they finally got it right. Everyone there is super friendly, especially the REALLY good looking new male bartender they hired! ;)
