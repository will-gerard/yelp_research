great service, they even told me a way to save money on the poster I needed for my class. Came to them kind of last minute and they took my order. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Definitely the best kinkos I've been to in Arizona (Utah is better). Still expensive, which is why it's not 5 stars. However, I was in dire need because all the other print shops I searched around Tempe closed at 5:30 or 6 pm. This place is open till 11 on weekdays! Great stuff

Took 30 minutes to receive the pizza cookie I ordered and was late to work because of it. They had maybe max 4 tables in the entire restaurant and still managed to burn my pizza and my pizza cookie. Management needs work.
