I had Rob from Sun State come out to my home and check out my AC unit that wasn't producing cold air anymore. Upon first visit we thought we found the problem but after coming home from work my house was still 85degrees. They came right back out the next day and fixed it. Came home today to a crisp 72 degree home. They were professional and produced. Very happy with the them.

I'm very picky with my pizza and it takes a lot for me to be impressed. I took my family to Vinny's and it was not what I expected. Seriously the best pizza I have ever had. I don't know what they do but it's seriously amazing! I will be going back for life. The best!

Was told the wait would be under 20 minutes. Waited for close to an hour before we left. Atmosphere is cool and drinks are good but to spend 6$ to park and walk down to the marina. Not worth it. So many better places to go for 1/2 the hassle.
