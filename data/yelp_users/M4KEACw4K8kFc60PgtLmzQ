Great place to chill and dine with their nice patio. The service was great. The food was delicious and appropriately priced.

Since we heard this was a restaurant by a celebrity chef, we've been wanting to try it out. We finally had the opportunity this past weekend to go along with family from out of town. We were in a big group and we expected longer wait times to get our food. The service was great but that's about it based on our experience. I ordered the seared tuna, which was recommended by the waiter. Boy was this tuna a big disappointment! It was overcooked and dry. It was like eating a flavorless dry chicken. Other people in the group who ordered the same were overcooked as well. I even tried other seafood dish ordered by other people like the shark, which turned out to be overcooked and salty to no surprise. For the prices of these entrees one would expect a much pleasurable dining experience. But this was not the case at all! To top off the bad experience, the group had to witnessed two cockroaches crawling up and down the surrounding drapes!  I'm not the type that normally write Yelp reviews, but this experience was bad enough for me to vent my frustration.
