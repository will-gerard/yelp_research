We order from the Lunch Bag a couple times a week as our office is close by.  The sandwiches are ALL fantastic, the delivery time is short, and the value is there for sure! Try the Ruben!!! great sandwich.... and the Tuna Salad is really good too.....also the homemade soups (I assume they are homemade) are fantastic!

Seated right away for lunch great service by Matt wonderful food delicious perfectly cooked pizza and a very large salad All for 9.99.  The house dressing is fantastic.  I had a four peaks beer and in lieu of the drink that came with lunch they served me an iced tea to go how accommodating.  I will be back for sure

Always great food!   The artichokes are to die for....  how they get 3 halves of heaven out of each grilled choke is beyond me.    The service is FANTASTIC with veteran service staff and talented seating people.   I have yet to have a bad experience.   The tuna is fantastic, trout wonderful, ribs great, chicken perfect.     The banana cream pie (my favorite pie) is prepared in a non traditional way that I wont order again but many love it!     The place is always busy and now you know why!  Thank you Bandera,   I will be back!  Frank T.

Try the baked wings with the oriental seasonings.   Awesome and healthy.  Great tequila selection and friendly service.  Cold beer could be priced better but good.

Went for a late lunch around 330 pm.  Apparently they thought business was over because they simply restock shelves and ignored me.  I went to fill up with unsweetened iced tea mention to them that it was out and they simply took away the container.  Sandwich was good.  But I will be reluctant to return.

I walked in the door at 1:56 and the hostess said we are closed.  I pointed out that it was still four minutes till two and she looked at her and watch smiled happily Seated me at the 2 person bar counter  I knew I was going to have a great experience.  I ordered the confit tuna salad and it was delightful.  Locally sourced ingredients (except for the tuna).    I also ordered a glass of Arizona wine    13. Sand-reckoner and I highly recommend it.  A great light lunch!!!  See pics

Appetizers were yummy   calamari,  meat balls....  good        all great and first part of chop salad was delicious till I pulled 16" hair out of the salad and my mouth simultaneously.... ghastly and a little vomit ensued.....   they need to use hair nets in the kitchen for sure.... all other aspects good but cant go back!

My bid it started out fantastic for lunch there was no line. I ordered and the clerk did not ask me for my frequent flyer card. When I said I wanted to use my number I had already paid so she could not do it and said you must go online. Things went downhill from there the water was a gray color and one machine I sat down at the table on my arm stuck to it and looking around very few of the tables were wiped down between visitors I love they ways food and this was good this time but they really need to work on your service and cleanliness

The Best mussels I've had in the desert in my 30 year here in Scottsdale fantastic service is great I highly recommend this restaurant I'm from Seattle and I am accustomed to fresh mussels and these were the best I've had here in az.   You'll be doing yourself an extreme disservice if you don't try this restaurant right away
