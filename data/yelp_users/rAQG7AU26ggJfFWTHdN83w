Overall, I would not return to this restaurant nor recommend it. Small tables and cramped. The waiter spoke so fast that we had to have him repeat the specials three times. He served us so fast that I got the feeling he really didn't want us there! We felt uncomfortable even asking him questions and pointing out our issues with one of the entrees. I had the veal piccata and it was perfect! The wine was excellent, but our other three guest where extremely dissapointed. The veal chop is much smaller than it used to be. One pasta dish was served very dry and at a cool tmperature. We sent it back. Bread was just ok. Not the amazing kind that you expect in an Italian place. The other dish was just so so. There are so many restaurants to choose from in this area that I won't go back.

This is by far the best Vietnamese food I have ever had! Short of visiting the country! LOL! The spring rolls are to die for, the soups are always fresh made to order and that is just the beginnning! My husband and I have been going here for 6 years! So glad the weather is cooling to make the soup that much more enjoyable!  Love the new decor! You can buy the real matcha green tea here as well!  Pamela,

We love this place! Never been to Vietnam, but this seems to be the real deal! Try the chicken soup! I always get extra basil and cilantro! Hubby likes the spring rolls. We really enjoy this place in the winter months.

Decided to try Hiro Sushi because of the  reviews as it is very difficult to find a good sushi restaurant in the valley.  With my husband being half Japanese, lived in Japan & just having visited Tokyo last May for 2 weeks - it takes a lot to win over our palates.    First, this not your typical modern sushi restaurant which translates to social meeting place/lounge for people that want mega rolls with different condiments splattered all over them. They have some, but  if that is what you think sushi is - head to Sapporo or RA.  Second, nothing against non-Japanese sushi chefs as they can be quite talented - but something about having Japanese sushi chefs creating your food that brings some authenticity to the whole experience.  Third, the fish was fresh and was served in good portions.  Its not about bigger is better - quality is what you pay for when it comes to sashimi or nigiri.  Looked over the entree menu - typical mix of tempura, teriyaki & katsu dishes - nothing real special.  Will definitely go back.

I go to many of the resort spas throughout the valley and this by far is one of my favorites! A dear friend and I love to meet here at least twice a year! Excellent service, quite spa pool, fresh new robes they added recently and the ambience is superb! I'm a spa junkie, so this is a gem! Can't wait to go back! I've used the salon services too! Ask for Brooke! She's been there for years and is amazing! They offer us locals a discount too! Just show your ID and ask about specials! You can't help but find something to buy in the boutique too! Lol!

My husband and I have been members at this Massage Envy for the past 6 years. We have had a variety of therapist and for the most part, they have all been great. The key is to always keep a list of your favorites in your phone and book early! We love to get 1.5-2 hour sessions and not all of the therapist do more than and hour. Excellent location and they offer a couples room which is great for friends or couples! Highly recommend them!

My husband and I have been coming here for years! Love this place! Food is always consistent. I find the staff is always very pleasant and happy. Never had one problem in 10 years and we are foodies! Oh yeah, it's lobster season right now which is the best!

This convention center has really grown and is huge now! We had to park a bit away from the entrance, but you could go through the building all the way to the trade show floor and stay out of the heat! Also easy drop off and pick up area for vendors and visitors.   Every year I go with my girlfriends to the IBS Trade Shows and it is awesome! I highly recommend the Spa & Esthetician Show more than the hair and nails. The hair show is very small in comparison to some of the shows held in CA, NY and Chicago. I am a spa junky so I love going to learn about all the new products for your skin and anti aging things! I also enjoy networking with vendors I have met over the years. I plan way in advance to attend every June.   My husband has also attended trade shows over the years in this convention center and he loves the ease of getting to it from the strip! If you don't have a car, you can take the monorail. Drops you off right there!

Great Mexican place in Cave Creek. Authentic atmosphere. Food is reasonably priced. The hostess on the other hand is not so nice! Don't ask for outside seating! She'll put you in your place for you being dare enough to ask! I was made to feel like I should be grateful for even getting a seat inside!!!!

Love our Marriott(s)! This place is perfectly private, but just close enough to the action of Vegas!  We have been timeshare owners in Park City, Utah for about 16 years now and love it! Originally we purchased so that we could go snow skiing/boarding every year for our vacation. As we have aged, we don't do the snow as much anymore. We have used our points all over the world with our Marriott timeshare and or their hotels.  I love the Chateau because you are super close to everything, but don't have to walk through a smoky casino to get to your room. They greet you with "free" valet parking and fresh cool beverage when you enter the lobby! They recently re-did the fitness center. It is perfect for a morning workout and relax in the steam room. Just what a body needs after a night in Vegas! The rooms are consistent with the décor and size with all the other Marriott timeshares. That's one of the many things we love about ownership. Consistency! The bedding and pillows are what I call "perfect"! Huge Jacuzzi tub that I often forget to use. Ugh! The shower in main suite is two headed and huge for hubby and I. Nice pool bar with excellent view of the strip. Not crazy about the pool itself on the top. It's small, but the new pool on level 5 is awesome! Very spacious. secluded and nicely decorated. They offer a variety of happy hours in the lobby. Example:  1 Free Bloody Mary from 10am to 11am on Saturdays, 1 Free Mimosa from 9am to 10am on Sunday, etc, etc, etc. I thought that was a nice touch! They offer a little market onsite too if you need. There is also drug stores in walking distance. We always bring some groceries with us.  We highly recommend Marriott's Grand Chateau!

Who doesn't love healthy, organic food??? We love shopping here! Great variety of food and the employees are always über helpful! Try their brand of vegetable chips! Great for stashing in your draw at work for a quick scooby snack! I like the spinach cakes too in the frozen section! Cant remember the brand, but just ask! Great prices on produce too!

I've been going here for years! They keep the place clean and up to date! They usually always squeeze me in if needed. Only recommend that you find a favorite tech and stick with them. Everyone has a different style and way of doing things. I used to be a nail manicurist so I am more critical than the norm! :)

We were recently in Las Vegas to attend the IBS Trade Show and we were staying close to Planet Hollywood. There was four of us and we had trouble deciding on food! Casual and cheap or dressy and no so cheap! Well this was the place! I only gave it four stars versus five due to the cost of this fantastic dinner! Yes, it was fantastic! I have posted a few items that we had. First of all, the waiter was exceptional! I think his name was Scott, but wouldn't swear to it due to alcohol consumption! He was extremely helpful with explaining the menu and what would best suite each of our appetites. Love the chic décor with the red vintage feel. We had a corner booth style table that was private and allowed for intimate conversation. I felt that the food portions were overall generous. Especially being a high end steak house. My favorites were the Maine Lobster Linguine and Lobster Bisque (Picture that is posted doesn't do it justice!). Obviously I am a lobster fan! My girlfriend had the surf and turf. Again, there was lobster involved! Her steak was cooked perfect for her and she is picky! We had the Baby Iceberg Salad. Always one of my favorites and they didn't miss a beat with this one. Broccolini was nice, but the Black Truffle Creamed Spinach is the best ever! The waiter recommended the perfect wine to pairing with our entrees. I am now on the hunt for one of the wines to purchase by the bottle locally in the Phoenix area.  Highly recommend Strip House Steak House! Budget accordingly. It is well worth every dime! I also feel like they would go the extra mile if you had a special occasion going on. Just call ahead! Perfect place for a celebration of some sort!

My husband and I went to Stax on a Saturday afternoon. He had read reviews on the place and took me there. When we arrived, I said OMG, not another burger joint? LOL! Turned out to be so different and was "great"! This is a very cool retro place! Our server/bartender, Bran, was actually one of the owners. He was very helpful with educating us on the menu and how it to be creative. You have the opportunity to try so much, but not spend a bundle! They serve mini burgers in a variety of meats! So, you can get as many as you want and even share! I love sweet potato fries and my husband loves tater tots. They offer the half and half deal and we were both happy! This is a place that we will revisit again! Next time I plan to try one of the customized macaroni dishes! Yum Yum!

We went to Stax for a quick bit before hitting Fashion Square. They have the best sweet potatoe fries and regular tater tots ever, but that isn't what makes this place! If you want the "not so ordinary" burger, this is it! They serve mini sliders so you can get a little taste of several different meats. Yesterday, we had lamb, red snapper and pheasant. Yes, pheasant! They change their game up weekly! Get it? Venison, Elk, Buffalo, Kangaroo..............you name it, they game it! The prepare everything fresh and add unique toppings that really enhance the meat you choose. If you go, try the Sangria! White or Red! Nice and refreshing with the heat at 100 right now and perfect with just about anything on the menu! We won't wait so long to go back again! Thank you Bran! Stan and Pamela,

This is one of my favorite places to meet my girlfriend before our facials and or mani/pedi! Awesome happy hour with a variety of appetizers. Sushi is good for a quick fix. The only thing I could say is that the edamame never seems fresh and is over cooked, but otherwise, love the service and food is good! Perfect for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon delight!

My husband and I love this place! Great happy hour and the customer service is perfect! There is one waiter who is extremely educated about the food! He explains how it is prepared and the do and don'ts of! I think his name was Eugene, but won't swear to it.   We were casually enjoying happy hour one Saturday night and the bartender over heard that we had just celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary! She notified the manager and before we could pay our tab, a beautiful desert with a candle was served to us at the bar! Very nice! As always, we will go back. Usually once a month. Ask the bartender to recommend a variety of apps so you can get a little taste of everything! Too much good stuff to just eat one or two things!

My husband and I are sushi fanatics! We have been to Japan so we are super picky! We really enjoy their fresh sushi and sashimi! The Wahoo is excellent! Much like butter fish! The Redneck Roll is fantastic! We haven't had anything we didn't like. We haven't done the open grill thing, but always see them in action while at the bar or sushi bar. Looks great! The owners are always around to meet and greet you. Very clean and fun place to go! Love Matt and Ryan at the bar! Cheers to you!  Pamela,

Need to have a really yummy, I'm gonna be bad breakfast? This is it! The bacon bloody will definitely jump start you followed by a unique menu of all sorts of good food! Biscuits and gravy are yum, but we have eaten here a few times and nothing is less than great! Omelets are awesome! If it is your first visit, try to request sitting in the car! It's just plain fun to do! Enjoy!

Love the ambience of this place! The night we went, there was a guy playing the piano in the bar who was awesome! The recent night we visited we only had a cocktail and happy hour menu, but we have eaten here before and it is divine! We will definitely be doing dinner here again soon! Drinks are super pricey, but that seems to be the norm for this type of restuarant.

Everything about this spa is absolutely gorgeous and such a unique spiritual experience! I am a local in the valley, so when there are local spa deals in that heat of the summer my girlfriend and I take avantage of the time to go! The treatments here are five-star resort expected. They are extremely professional and consistent. I always know what to expect! I especially liked the cold shower, steam room and inhalation room. I will typically spend all day enjoying the facilities before and after my treatment(s). Food is pretty good that my friend and I order poolside. The waiting area to get your treatment is like the I dream of Jeannie bottle!   Here's the cons that I recently experienced. The pool area was dirty and needed basic maintenance and deep cleaning. There was a half dead/half alive ficus tree as you entered the pool area on the left. The rubber mat poolside was really dirty. Towels seemed to be very aged and worn. They were super busy no didn't have enough staffing. I kind of feel like because so many locals take advantage of summer rates, that maybe they don't take as much consideration to providing excellence like they do for the winter guest. Well, we can handle the heat, you offer the deals because the spa needs us during the slow season and we love this place! I'll be back even though I had a few complaints. Maybe they will see this and do some house keeping!

Unimpressed............my husband and I are sushi freaks! Every trip we go on, we have to find a sushi place! We should have paid attention to the reviews! Some of them were good and we like to give them the benefit of the doubt sometimes!   There was four of us who decided to go down to Freemont Street! After walking around aimlessly, we ended up settling for this place. Sashimi pieces did not seem fresh. Rice was dry and service took forever! It was kind of late in the evening and not many tables occupied. We knew it was probably close to closing time, but really? My girlfriend had the chicken teriyaki that was super dried out and nothing much for the sides. My husband hates to complain so I kept my mouth shut on this one. We just won't ever go back! I didn't even take pictures! I should have! It might go along with my description of everything! Tables were also dirty even after the waitress wiped it down with a "dirty" wet towel! This place gives the Japanese a bad name. :(  There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to settle for this one. Not worth the money at all and over priced at that! UGH!

My husband and I recently celebrated our 14th Wedding Anniversary at this restuarant with several of our friends back in September. The food was fabulous! The ambience perfect! Nice bar area too! We went during restaurant week so it was super busy! Our waitress began to slack a bit and we had issues at the end of our meal, but the Manager on duty quickly resolved things for us! This Manager went above and beyond to make us happy and ensure that we would be repeat customers! We will! Thank you Fogo de Chao! We will be dinning there in 2 weeks! Our friends from CA will be joing us! We are looking forward to another wonderful dinner!  Thank you Pamela,

I just love this food! I especially enjoy Mon-Fri lunch. You have the opportunity to several different items without spending a fortune. It can be a bit expensive in the evening, but lunch is just right! The food is all made fresh the very moment you order! No pre-made soup here! Highly recommend it! The owners are awesome!

I have had the opportunity to visit this restaurant a couple of times for lunch and once for dinner. The best thing I can say about Takeda Thai is "YUM"! The food is fresh and it actually taste like it is too! Service is great. Nice place to take a date. It can be expensive, but worth it! About the same as other restaurants in the area.  Pamela,

I love when I am in Scottsdale on business so I can stop in the is place for lunch or early dinner! Ambiance is very nice and cozy. The food is made fresh and actually taste like it! Great place for a date too! I would only say that it can be a little expensive, but it is right in line with the cost of dinning in that area! Worth it for me!

Beautiful atmosphere and that's about it! Reservation was at 8pm. First round of drinks took 40 minutes and the place was dead! My girlfriend already did a Yelp Review on this place and I am pretty sure she covered everything! I am mostly dissapointed that a manager never came to the table to apologize or acknowledge all the issues we had that night. Super pricey for a super let down! We thought that with Eva Longoria's name behind this restaurant, it would have been amazing, but it was far from it! :( N wonder we were able to get reservations so easily!

We have been members here for about 2 years. They offer so many diverse classes that you have to print out two calendars! I really enjoy Yoga, Spin and Kick Boxing so there are tons of classes and times to choose from! The locker rooms and showers are super clean! All of the equipment seems to be well maintained too. That was one of the reasons we cancelled our last gym membership.  If you have a family, this is the perfect place for you! Awesome daycare. We utilized it for our grandchild that came to visit and we're very happy with the cost and care.   You definitely get your monies worth from this gym! Occasionally the steam room needs to be maintenanced, but what do you expect when it is used everyday of the year! LOL!  Thanks Mountainside!

We used to go to a very expensive, well known dry cleaners in the valley before discovering Delia's! Thank goodness because I have so many things that I need to have dry cleaned and was going broke! The only thing I wish they would do is separate my clothes from my husband's clothes. I am sure that if I request it they will take care of me. Happy cleaning!

My husband and I have been using this dry-cleaners since it opened a few years ago. We are very happy with the quality of service we receive! I am amazed of how quickly the turnaround time is too! The employees working at this location are pleasant and provide great customer service. Recently I had an issue with some seamstress work. The manager reached out to me and corrected the problem immediately. We highly recommend Delia's Cleaners!

I have spent months and months trying to find a great hair dresser!!! My friend recommended this place. No names, but she wasn't good! I had hot roots! Ugh! I called and spoke with the manager. He apologized and put me with Johnathan. Awesome! He fixed me right up and continues to take excellent care of my hair! Thank goodness!!! Love the Lather Lounge! They offer a hand and arm massage while you are having your hair shampooed all the while in a reclined massage chair! Nice touch to offer the clients! Complimentary beverage is included too!

Food is just what we expected, great! The service was super slow!   We just happened to hit this restaurant on a Friday night and they got slammed right after we ordered drinks. They said it was due to surrounding events that caused them to be unusually busy. It took way too long for us to get our drinks and that was right before the major rush hit.  The atmosphere was casual and a bit on the noisy side. Very brightly lit! It is in the middle of a main shopping area. Kind of fun for people watching. I didn't care for my Moscow Mule cocktail. I sent it back. Not sure how they make theirs and couldn't keep the waiter long enough to find out, but they replaced it with another drink. We understood how busy it was, but the waiter didn't even try to explain and or apologize. Nor check back with us on how our food was. We had to ask for the manager. They did comp one of our beers for the wait. We had Alfredo, Pizza and Eggplant. All of which were delicious!   We recommend Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria! Just check to see how busy they are before you sit down! Vegas can be so unpredictable!

I bought my VW Passat back in May and I love everything about it except now I want the CC!!!!! That's next! If you want excellent customer service, this is the place to go! My car was spotless and ready to roll upon my arrival. The salesman took plenty of time with me to cover all the bells and whistles with me. Buying a new car is hard, but these guys made it super easy for me! My first maintenance check up was awesome! They went over everything in detail and answered any questions I had. All the while they were cleaning my baby before they handed over my keys and I was we'll on my way! :)  Only suggestion I have.......test drive more so you can enjoy the experience longer and make sure you buy your exact dream car!!!!!

Cool little place with a great concept! It was a fun girlfriend experience! I don't benefit from this on a weekly basis, but woman like my friend who has long, thick hair love it!!! When you do the monthly deal it is well worth it! I personally would do it for special occasion only. Very chic atmosphere and they serve nice goodies too!

Über cool and pleasantly surprised! We arrived at 5:30 to check out the bar for happy hour. They offer incredible old fashioned infused cocktails and unique appetizers! For dinner we started with the chop salad that is a must!!!!!!!! I had the seared scallop dish! It was perfect! My husband had short ribs that were excellent! The bartender, Thomas, was extremely personable and educated us on the entire experience of this place! We enjoyed him so much that we passed on taking a table we had reserved! We love to try a little bit of everything when dinning someplace new. Unfortunately, we couldn't check out the mixology bar upstairs because we did not have a DD! Next time for sure! It's a little hidden secret in Old Town Scottsdale! We recommend to go early so you can enjoy everything!

I "use" to be a fan of this restaurant! It was one of my favorite places for happy hour when I could get over there! Recently I met a friend for lunch. I am gluten-free so my options were limited, but I was still able to find something. I had chicken salad and the mushroom soup. The soup was excellent! The chicken salad was ok. My friend had a hamburger. Overall it was good with the side salad. For the most part I enjoyed the decor. It could use a little updating. The reason I gave two-stars this time was because of what we witnessed during our lunch. The owner was there and was obviously doing a site visit/quality-control. He was parading around the restaurant on his phone and ranting at someone on the other end. It was obvious that he was unhappy with the performance of the restaurant and/or his employees. He was slamming things around and speaking loudly. He came across very rude and belittling to everyone. His display of disrespect for his employees is extremely unprofessional to begin with, but even worse to do it in front of customers while they are dining. If you really want people to perform well, you must treat them with respect and you should have your meetings in private! I doubt that I will return to this restaurant because of the scene I had to watch through my entire lunch. I do not wish to give my business to arrogant and egotistical people such as this owner. Also, I do feel like they need to update the menu, maybe offer a gluten-free optional menu and adjust your prices. So therefore, I'm out! Too many other options in that area!

My first visit to Ocean Spa was awesome! I loved it so much that I have taken my Mom, Sister and two girlfriends here, but the past two times were not so pleasant! First of all, I don't like getting a manicure and pedicure at the same time!!!! I like to relax and sometimes even nap during a pedicure. My tech today insisted that I get both at the same time even when I said no! My service took less than an hour! I felt like I had a drive through mani/pedi! When you pay good money for spa services, you should be pampered, not pushed out the door! My polish chipped the second day after previous visit and the paint job today wasn't any better! I will have to touch up my own cuticles too! The only reason for 2 stars is that they have great massage chairs and I like the ambience if they let you sit there long enough to enjoy it! Don't get the gel polish! It doesn't last and cost $20 more per mani or pedi! There are many choices in this area that I won't be going there again! :(

My husband and I have been to a couple of the Pita Jungles and we love it! Healthy menu especially right after a good workout! The ambience at this location is very cool. The employees were friendly and fun! I like to get the sampler platter so I can have a taste of everything! We like to go on Saturday afternoons and catch whatever game is playing on the tube. I could see how they would get crowded and loud at night! First visit, go early so you can get educated on the menu and take in the atmosphere!

We went to this restaurant with another couple. The ambiance was nice, but loud so it was hard to have a conversation. I would pick a slow night if we went back. The food is awesome and extremely affordable! Temperature of the sides were not warm enough, but sounds like they were already aware of that and working on it. I love how you can order the wine! If you have a hard time choosing, the way they offer their servings is cool! Taste, 1/2 glass or full glass! You have the chance and can afford to try different wines! We would recommend this place!

We've tried this place out twice now. Great ambiance and location. Food is ok. The burrito is served naked. looks weird and uninviting to eat, but taste ok. They do serve large portions, but would be nice to have lunch size options and pricing. How much should you pay for Mexican food? Less than what they charge is for sure! They follow a long line of unsuccessful restaurants in that location and will might be jinxed! I would not recommend this place. Many other choices in the area! Save your money!

Where should I start? This is the best little place to have all your florist needs met! I was recently invited to a private event at The Flower Bar by my financial advisor. There was a small group of us that gathered here for an evening of lesson 101 on floral design, refreshments and fun! The owner, Megan, enlightened us with interesting tips on floral arranging and basic do it yourself ideas. She is an absolute doll! She's full of life and passion about her work and what it all means to her! I only wish I could do my wedding all over again just to have her design my bouquet! She is the prime example of following your dream and making it come to life!   Take a look at her website for details of floral design offered. I'm not sure of all her specs and specialties! Just that her work is exquisite!

Best sushi/sashimi in N Scottsdale Area! This is our favorite Japanese restaurant! My husband and I go once a week for date night! I'm ashamed that it's taken me over a year to write this review!   First, we are sashimi connoisseurs. We've traveled to Japan and my husband is half Japanese, so I think we can say that with much validity.  Secondly, they have gluten-free soy sauce and they don't treat me like a difficult customer because I request GF!   The sashimi is our main course 90% of the time and it's always extremely fresh and properly prepared. You can order the platters which start at $30 and go up from there in increments of $10. Obvious the larger amount, you will get the variety as well as upper grades of seasonal fish available. *Ask your server what the specialties are of the day. We recommend the Shochikubai chilled sake to go with. It's our Japanese style "wine with dinner" concept.   The bartender, Chris, is very creative with making new and hip cocktails. The most recent favorite of mine is the Fig and Cherry Mule. Yummmmo! It is made with imported Italian cherries, lime, fig flavored specialty vodka and organic real ginger beer! There's many options of specialty drinks, so explore!  We've had a few cooked dishes too! My favorite is the Baked Chilean Sea Bass. I've had it the usual way served, but I'm gluten-free, so they prepare it a little different for me without the sauce. It's excellent either way! Also, I love the scallop dish! Chicken Katsu is my husbands favorite. It's always tender and juicy! It's crisp and light on the outside! Seafood pancakes are my friend's favorite! All of their dishes are a nice size portion too!  Lunch is perfect to have a bento box. Great value and you can check out different dishes.   Happy Hour:  Very simple and great value! Tempura is so light and crispy! Chicken Yakitori is our personal favorite appetizer. Sushi rolls are awesome on the HH menu and regular menu. As crazy as it my sound, they have the best edamame that is never over cooked! I've had that happen at other restaurants numerous times. Not here!  We highly recommend Nori! Excellent service, friendly staff and cool decor! We've referred numerous friends and strangers there. Every single one of them had positive feedback and continue to dine there. I've posted a picture of most of the items I mentioned, so please check them out.   On a final note. There food is always so strategically prepared and beautiful when presented to you! We are always impressed and have to take pictures!

I was recently visiting family in NC and my daughter insisted we have lunch here. So glad we did! The food is authentic and amazing! I had the minced lamb kebab! Delicious! You have to be open to the real deal here! Lebanese at its finest! No fake American altered cuisine! You get to watch them prepare your food fresh too! The food case was so beautiful in the center of it all that I had a hard time deciding what to order! Lol!   I over heard someone not happy with their dish and the server was extremely accommodating to replace it for them right away! I could tell it was the flavor and not the dish!!!!! Remember, you have to have the palette for authentic cuisine! This is no run of the mill place!    The owner went out of his way to greet us. Since my daughter frequents the place, they were very attentive, but I noticed that all the guest are treated that way too! I loved the flavors of my food so much that I had to score a container of spice to bring back to Arizona! They have a small selection of items you can purchase and the staff will educate you on how to use them. I've used this particular spice, not sure the name of it, the tag came off during my travels, on everything from my morning eggs to my chicken, fish and of course LAMB! Wow!   Lastly, it is a great place for inside or outside seating, large or small groups except call ahead for parties over 10 so they can accommodate you accordingly. Great place for the family! The granddaughter was happy at the young age of 2 1/2 yrs old!  Seems to be ideal for catering, but not sure if they offer that. Just ask!  This will be my first stop when I return to NC in the future! Can you open one in Scottsdale??? I haven't found a good Lebanese place here yet!   Enjoy!  Pamela

My husband and I celebrated our 17th anniversary here! We loved the atmosphere and the service is awesome! We are raving fans of Citizens Public House so knowing that they own Gladly, it was a must try! If you work in the area, check out the Happy Hour! Fun place to hang out and great bites not to mention very cool cocktails! The only thing I like better at Citizens is that is not as quite and my favorite bartender isn't there! Lol! Definite got to go!

My sister came to town and we decided to check out this little restaurant! It's the real deal in downtown Phoenix! Sushi Chef is from Osaka! His name is Juno! He not only serves everything fresh, but in a beautiful artistic way! We had ramen, sashimi and sushi rolls! Very generous portions and yummmmmo! Service is excellent! We highly recommend this place! It reminded my husband and I of the kind of restaurants we went to in Japan! Arigato!

Finally! There is a really cool place in Cave Creek that serves multiple needs of an ever growing human being! Not only is it a super cool place to pop in for coffee and a bite, but get your Yoga on! Afterwards, you can relax with a glass of vino. My husband and I checked out the place on Saturday. You definitely feel the amazing spirituality that has graciously been applied to every detail of the decor! There seems to be meaning and stories behind it all! Can't wait to see what's next! Live music is a local favorite with our friends and close to home! I'm excited to take my first yoga class there this week! I've met a couple of the teachers over the past year and they are awesome! Enjoy!

Being a gluten-free person can be very challenging even with so much awareness of its dangers theses days! I stumbled upon this fantastic restaurant for people like us! I had their hot chick sandwich with onion rings and it was amazing. Spicy, fresh and cheesy sandwich on flaxseed bread! A perfect recommendation from Julianne! She was super helpful in my decision making for the perfect dish and desert! Such huge portions that half the lunch is packed to take home! Be sure to try the aioli garlic sauce for dipping your fries or onion rings in! Yummo!!! They also offer local honey and gluten-free flours so you can take home to make your own homemade goodies GF! I'll be back for sure! Just wish you had a location up in Cave Creek!
