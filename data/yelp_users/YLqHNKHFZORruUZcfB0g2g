Beautiful beautiful property. Now for the sad bad news.  Apparently, they think with such a big name, beautiful property they can rest on their laurels.  The service was non-existent.  They didn't seem to know they  were at work to take care of the guests.  I most certainly won't be back (not that they'll notice or care).

For a new restaurant I think they did very well.  I went on what I believe was their  2nd night of being open. My group started with the spicy edamame, the ceviche, and the house made fries. I'm very picky, the ceviche had a huge thumbs up from the table, as did the amazing fries. I think the edamame could use a BIT of tweaking.  The group all looked very happy with the entrees ordered.  I ordered a green jungle curry bowl, really good kick of spice, which I appreciated.  I don't believe in bland! I'm not a dessert person but they do have homemade desserts I was told by the cutie server girl. I visit Scottsdale for biz, I will go back (and even try the edamame again).
