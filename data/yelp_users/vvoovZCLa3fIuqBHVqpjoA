Beware how much $$$ you give the bartender, likes to shortchange ya! Never that drunk that I don't know how much I am due back :(

Awesome experience each time that I've dined here!! Atmosphere is as equally impressive as the food and the service! Our server, Whitney, was delightful each time I've been there, as is the rest of the waitstaff! This place is a gem :-)
