Great turn around on service. I came last minute to get something altered and they did it without any complaints. They also gave me a military discount which I appreciated.

Daniel in the print center is rude and needs to learn how to speak to customers. I am pretty sure they sell books about how to treat customers in this store. He should read them on his breaks.

Very friendly staff. They are very professional and don't mind answer all your questions. I was really nervous about my surgery and I had a lot if questions they were really nice about answering all my questions and calming me down before my surgery.   They office is extremely clean and is decorated in a nice calm Hawaiian theme.

I love this place. The staff is very professional. A great place to come to relax and unwind. I was in a car accident and I was able to make a same day appointment. Once I arrived the staff was very accommodating. They have a good line of vegan nail products. I love the variety of the vegan nail polish colors. They even have vegan nail polish remover. They have a wide variety of vegan products for your body.

Very horrible customer service. I called everyday for a week and was promised the orthodonist would call and she never did. When I scheduled a cleaning they never even called me to confirm it and that they received my insurance information.

Very friendly staff. They open at 7am two days a week which makes it easier to get in and out before work!!! Dr. Hudson is very professional and does not over book his appointments so your not waiting around all day.

I did not believe I would make the transformation that Jennifer promised me but I did. I loved coming to this boot camp and my body loved it too. Jennifer will challenge you and build your confidence all at the same time. Try the first 4 weeks free and make the difference in your body and life style!!!

The brunch is delicious and has a good price. Mimosas and brunch for $10.86 a price that can't be beat.

The staff was extremely nice. This place is really clean and smells nice. This is my first time here and I had Jennifer as am massage therapist and she is wonderful. She asked what where my problem areas and made sure to focus on those areas. I really like this place because of the prices. I got an excellent massage and i did not have to break the bank.

I have been a customer of this nail spa for about two years. I love coming here to get my gel nail. They are always gentle and perfect with my nails. I tend to go after a long day of work and they really know how to make sure that I am relaxed. They are not your typical nail salon they have many different types of spa services. What ever you would like to have done to your nails or body they will be able to accomplish it.

Staff here is always super nice. They are always eager to serve you and make sure that you are satisfied with your order. Everything here is made fresh so sometimes you may have to wait longer to get your food.  You can order your food to go online and get a 5% off discount.
