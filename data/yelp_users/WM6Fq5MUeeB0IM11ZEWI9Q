I went there for my 30th Birthday celebration. We were greeted immediately by a friendly staff member and taken to a table that was not set up for the number of guests we had even though we had called ahead several days prior for a reservation. We were given 2 dinner menus for 5 people. We asked about happy hour menu and he brought back one menu and wasn't able to answer questions about it. He took the appetizer order from 3 people and left the table without taking order from the other two. He didnt return till the appetizers came out from the original order. The apps were fantastic! (Stuffed Shrimp, Shrimp Cocktail and Salmon). We asked about the price fixed menu for $60 and he didnt really know much about it. We ordered out entrees and they arrived rather quickly. The entrees where very bland and lacked flavor and substance. I have had way better food at Olive garden, which is really sad for the price of the food.  Very disappointed.

Came here for dinner tonight and we were seated promptly by the hostess near the window near other guests that were dining. We sat at our table approximately 10-12 min without acknowledgement. There was a server, I believe her name was Gina, was serving a table directly in front of us and never once made eye contact with us or asked if we had been helped yet. I did not see any manager walking the floor to address this issue with so we just got up and left. They were not even busy at the time so there was no excuse for this level of service. Very very disappointed.

Went here on a date and I was impressed with the intimate feel and ambiance the restaurant had. It was quite inside and the decor really made you feel like you were eating in a Tuscan restaurant. Service started off slightly slower through the beverage round but he was friendly and made suggestions based on what we may eat for dinner. We started off with some Caprese and it was delicious... The mozzarella was soooo good! We had the Lasagna and Tagliatelle alla Toscana pasta for our meals and they were both excellent and so full of flavor. Best I have had... REALLY. Overall really good fun experience and will definitely be back.

Went to the Quick lube area (emphasis on "quick lube") and was greeted by a representative almost immediately. I had advised him that I needed an oil change and one other small issue corrected (tire rubbing on front plastic fender) and he advised me that it would be about an hour to hour and 20 minutes. I said that's fine I will wait. So I waited and watched numerous people come and go which showed up before and after me both, and still no word on my truck. At approximately 2 hours in, I inquired about it and he said its in the wash rack and it will be right out. I had asked him "They fixed the fender right?" to which he replied "That's it" and pointed at me as if he knew he had forgotten something. At this point I had been waiting for a little over 2 hours. He came back in the room a few minutes later and said it will just be a few more minutes "almost done". I waited almost 3 hours before I saw my truck, which after coming out of the wash rack was still dirty and had dirt smeared across the doors from the towel dry. The inside of the wheel wells were still muddy and not cleaned. Now I know that this is a complimentary service you provide, but still, why waste the effort if its not going to be done professionally(On the plus side, my windows were clean and most of the bugs where washed off the front). The work was completed as requested and my representative was very nice and polite but did not apologize for the delay or take ownership of maybe forgetting to tell the mechanics about some of the work needing to be completed. I understand this is a very busy area of the service department but better emphasis should be placed on quoting customers accurate times and completing work without having to be reminded or asked by the guest if something was done. I had to cancel and reschedule an appointment due to this 3 hour oil change. Should have probably done it myself at home. Pretty disappointed for my 1st visit. I hope the second one is better.

My wife and I come here often as this is our favorite pizza place. We actually drive over 15 miles to come, it's that good. Today we were taken back as to how dirty and filthy the restaurant was. The dining room had trash on the floor through out and most ( I would say about 85%) of the tables were very dirty and left unbussed. Made it difficult to find a place to sit that was clean without having to wipe down are own table. Not to mention the tremendous eye sore looking into the dining room and seeing trash everywhere. Have to say, not our best experience dining in. Food was great though!

I had a terrible experience with the quality of my food today. I ordered two cheese enchiladas and the cheese inside wasn't even melted... Still whole shredded cheese that was cool in the center. Cheese wasn't even melted on top of the enchiladas and the sauce was luke warm. I ate two bites and threw the rest away... Visually it didn't even look right, not sure why or how it even made it out of the kitchen.
