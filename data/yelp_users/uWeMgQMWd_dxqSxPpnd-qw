I love Pane Bianco--but sadly they have priced me out of their market  for the most part when it comes to sandwiches.  $13 for their tuna sandwich is outrageous--and beyond a price point that I am willing to pay under any  circumstances.  At 9 or even 10 I thought it was reasonably fair and allowed for a tip--at $13  it is not affordable and there is nothing left over for a tip.  I am so sorry that I won't be having lunch there anymore with any kind of frequency.

Why can't all retailers follow the Nordstrom way of customer service?  On a saturday night I went in and bought a printer.  when I got home there was an email from best buy with a coupon of 15% of f the printer I had just purchased.  So Sunday--I get up, wait for the store to open--to see if they will simply make the adjustment over the phone--I called twice and the phone was never answered.    So--I went on line to make sure  what the price should be when I go in to return and rebuy--as it turns out--the online price was less expensive than the store price plus the discount.  Anyway--to be on the safe side, I purchased on line with in store pick up--went over to the store.  The women in customer service says--when I say no one answered the phone when I called this morning--we were slammed--here we are in a technology store and they don't have the phone technology that allows you to leave a message?  I believe it is called voice mail.  And they were slammed at 10:15 on a Sunday morning--by 11--the store seemed pretty empty to me.  Anyway--the women says--oh I will just give you the discount on the one you purchased and return the one you bought on line--but it turns out that the one on line was cheaper than the price in a store--I do not understand with the changing nature of shopping and retail stores desperate to get people in the door why you would do that?  Something that should have been handled by a phone call--cost me an hour of my time--no big deal in the scheme of things--but it could be so much better so easliy--with someone at Best Buy paying attention and following the Nordstrom way.

I must put my 2 cents worth in about Vincents.  I personally will never go to Vincents again.  We went one new year's eve for a friend's husband birthday.  He is French and they are from Florida--so I was trying to make it a special occassion.   I remember very little about the meal because the service was HORRIBLE.  Red wine came after salads had been served.  A white wine sat on our table unopened until we were able to flag someone down--the serving of the meal was uneven at best and then servers got switched mid meal.  For a dinner that cost more than $500--I certainly expected more.  When I called to complain--their offer to me was a glass of champagne and a dessert--to make up for an evening that was suppose to be special on several accounts and turned out to be a disaster.

I went to dinner at Michelina's for the first time last night.  It is located in a strip mall just west of the 51--and talk about unassuming from the  outside!  the strip mall neighbors include a psychic and a locksmith--once inside the aromas take over and you know you will be having something wonderful.   The restaurant  is nice inside, but it is the food that is wonderful.  I had the sausage and peppers which was terrific and they provide everyone with a complementary frangelica after dinner.  the meal was reasonably priced for the quality of food and i will definitely be going back.

I recently went to the AAA office for passport pictures.  Service was quick--I also was able to take care of a title issue with my car.  Being able to do it at AAA saved me a visit to MVD.  Everyone was very helpful.

Had breakfast at Dicks Hideaway this morning before a big day of shopping (a group of friends is furnishing a room at a transitional housing program for women0--It was a great place to start the day--I hadn't been there in awhile and had forgotton how good the food is.  As usual the place was crowded (at 10 in the morning) so we sat at the bar (my favorite place)  I ordered carne adovada with scrambled eggs.  The adovado was rich and hot but no so hot to overwhelm the taste buds,  the eggs are nice complement to allow your taste buds to cool off before the next bite of the tender carne adovada.  if you can't get to new mexico any time Dick's Hideaway is a great place to get the red or green chili fix.

Went to empty bowls today in Tempe and then had lunch with a good friend at Essence Bakery.  I have lunched here several times and really enjoy.  Today it was the tomato and mozzarella and my friend had the spinach  but were excellent and the portion was just right.  this place is tiny and a little chaotic as a result, but the food makes up for it and then of course there are the macaroons--all colors and flavors--and if you can't decide which one you want--you can get a sampler set.

Summer doldrums perhaps?  I have been to St. Francis a number of times and generally the food has been quite delightful until last night --A friend and I went for dinner--and enough things weren't right to write a review and wave a little warning flag.  my friend ordered several sides--among them were the fingerling potatoes and roasted vegetables--now when I think of roasted vegetables--i think of eggplant, squash, peppers, asparagus--but only beans and corn??  I don't think so--for the price it seemed very skimpy and not very imaginative or creative which I know the St. Francis can do.  She also ordered the fingerling potatoes--which were underdone and flavorless--this after they had been forgotten on the order and attempt made to foist a bowl of soup on my friend instead.  I ordered the white fish--which was okay but not great and was served at a temperature of somewhere between not warm and cool.  The restaurant was not terribly busy--so perhaps this was just an off night--If you can't get the simple things right like roasted vegetables and potatoes--there is something wrong in the kitchen.

This is a great neighborhood joint!  I walked in a little before 11 and a group of women were in the corner, playing scrabble or some sort of game--clearly they were regulars.  The atmosphere is bare bones, but comfortable.  for lunch I had the tuna sandwich--this was a great sandwich--the proportion of tuna to apple was just right.  I will definitely be putting Bertha's on my rotation for a great place to go for a great sandwich.

You forget that there is still this level of service and quality of food until you experience again.  Had dinner here tonite with family.  from beginning to end the service and the food was outstanding.  I had the chopped salad, salmon and the table shared asparagus, lobster and mash potatoes and mac and cheese.  Everything was outstanding--although we didn't, the salads are plenty enough to share.  my salmon was flavorful and cooked to perfection--the mash potatoes and lobster and mac and cheese however were sublime.  Our server was fabulous--timed everything perfectly.    From now on--I am going to remember how this level of service and quality of food makes for a great evening.

James Beard would have cut the corn.    --Okay so I know you must be wondering exactly what that means.  We went to the restaurant on a wed night--picked up a great rose from AZ Stronghold at public market to avoid the corkage fee and was looking forward to a new dining experience.    Things started out fabously--the wait person was well informed and helpful with the menu.  We decided to split three dishes.  We ordered the scallops appetizer--they were perfect!  done to perfection which is not easily done with scallops.  We split them --put one on each plate.  Next came the jerk chicken salad--again--a wonderful complement of spicy chicken and mangos--the perfect marriage of spice and sweet.  we commented we had made the perfect choice of the Rose from AZ Stronghold and looking forward to the next course.  and so it came--jerk prawns, grilled pineapple on slaw--with a half an ear of corn--ahhhhhh there's the rub.  the plate would looked lovely, but because we were sharing--I asked the wait person--if the corn could be cut in half--don't get me wrong, i really liked my dining companion, but could not just bring myself to  nibble on the same ear of corn.  the wait person took the plate  back to the kitchen--we were salivating because the prawns smelled really wonderful--  then the plate came back--and the ear of corn was still in tack-- during the course of rest of the evening we were given several reasons, why this simple request could not be accomodated  ahh-the chef is an artist and cutting the corn would have upset the balance of the design of the plate.  we could not cut the ear ourselves because there were no sharp knives.-- there are only two chefs and there isn"t time to accomodate special requests  ok--this is a restaurant with maybe 10 tables--by the time we left there were only 2 people left in the restaurant.--so special requests can't be accomodated?  Also we would have eaten the corn, but instead it was wasted.  I am self employed and my customers are everything to my livlihood.  If I can accomodate I will even though it might not be exactly what I want to do--because the more important thing is I want to establish long term relationships with  them and have them come back again and again and again.  Unfortunately--I will not be going back to breadfruit--the food was generally good--but I would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple requests and the benefit to do that is repeat customers.--it would have been so easy to have satisfied customers, by simply cutting the ear of corn.

I have eaten here several times and always enjoy the food.  The food is always very fresh and with a great deal of flavor.  My favorite wrap is the black bean sunflower--the half wrap is very filling and a symphony of tastes.  I love being able to get a pot of tea to make ice tea with as well.  on my recent visit--I had a nori roll with a great peanut dipping sauce--it was again a wonderful blend of tastes.  if you are in the mood for vegetarian done right--try Chakra.

Central Girl goes West I have a friend who lives in the west valley and always is driving into town.  So when we decided to have dinner tonite--thought I would go west instead and boy was the trip worth it.  We had dinner at Arrowhead Grill.  This place hits the right note on just about everything--very casual, tables aren't on top of each other and service is very well paced and not intrusive--but after all that it really comes down to the food  My friend had the Delmonico steak and I had the special which was an arctic fish--we also shared a chopped  salad, green chile mac and cheese and asparagus--  Everything was done just right--the steak and fish were excellent, the mac and cheese had just enough green chile but not too much to over power it.  even the asparagus was terrific--crunchy and tender at the same time.  we did save room for dessert and ordered the butter cake topped with vanilla been ice cream and chocolate swirl--the cake had a fabulous taste and texture--decaf coffee was a great complement to it.  i will definitely go back-especially now that I know where it is.  If it is your first time and it is at night it will take a minute to find--because there is no lit signage (at least there wasn't tonite)  just follow the cars  Arrowhead Grill is definitely worth a trip west.

Phoenix Dog/Cat is a great veterinary practice.  I was referred years ago with my first cat from  the Humane Society and have gone there with subsequent new family members.  We are quickly seen and they understand when the patient (cat) has decided to hide under the bed 10 minutes before her appt.  They are caring professionals and I always feel as if Rita in getting great care.

We went here on a Wed night.  The menu is four courses, prix fixe.  The only choice to make was the main course.  A wine pairing is also offered.  Dinner was sublime--I don't know how else to describe it.  I loved the cold zucchini soup, the salad, the crab cakes and the dessert.  The wine was superbly paired and I was able to substitute white for the red--it was wonderful with the crab and it was also 109 in Phoenix.  Friends had the filet mignon --we exchanged bites--all was wonderful.  Dinner was $55 and wine $25--It was certainly very reasonable for the quality and the quantity. One more note--the restaurant is lovely --the surroundings are delightful and truly adds to the fact that you know after the first bite--that it is going to be a magical and wonderful evening.

It saddens me to write this review.  I started to going to Camelback Health Care when they first broke out on their own--they had an office on 40th St. around the corner  from where they are now.  In the early years--the office was clearly patient focus.  there was even one occasion when Dr. Reed called me after hours to check on me.  I thought that this was going to be my health care home for a long time.  Unfortunately things changed.  They moved onto Camelback into a much more expensive office and started offering botox, juviderm, etc.  Initially I didn't think much about that--I actually thought how cool--they have established a cash flow to support the practice--so those who are providing primary care can really focus on that.  How wrong--over several years things have deteriorated.  It is not about the actual health care which is okay--it is about the patient/physician relationship and the staff at the office.  the tenor of the office is one of the fact that they have forgotten who pays the bill.  In my case that is mostly me because of high deductible insurance.  I have seen the front office treat other patients terribly including me.  Now with your appointment the eyes are focused on the electronic health record and not building patient rapport--I had taken to making notes so I could get everything covered in my 15 minutes.  One of the things that they have really let go of is managing patient expectations.  i had several occasions where I made appointments with specific needs only to get there to find out that what I had scheduled for could not be accommodated.  If the folks on the phone had provided better information, perhaps I would not have been so frustrated.--Clearly they have no respect for the patient 's time.  I am not naive about the nature of health care today.  In fact I manage a case management program that helps keep patients informed about the care they are getting--we are successful  because we treat our patients with a great deal of respect and we keep them informed about what to expect.  Camelback Health Care has lost all of that caring environment that was so evident--When I would go, all I could see is get on with-don't bother us with your concerns because we need to make our quota of patients so we can bill, bill, bill!  I wrote two snail mail letters over the past three years to the office--there was no response to the first one and for the second one I got  a CYA letter that I had voluntarily terminated from them and to call 911 if I had an emergency.  It pains me to have switch physicians---even now--I think if someone had reached out to me to discuss my issues that I would not have terminated the relationship.  Clearly though there was no concern that a patient was leaving under a negative situation.  I know the world of health care is changing--but I think through my experience--there can be a balance for the need for the physician to produce in order to encounter and get paid and still have some concern about what is really going on with the patient.  I knew I had made the right decision today when I walked in to get my medical record.  there are now blue flyers on the counter that gives patients a whopping $30 incentive if the patient posts a positive review at a variety of websites including yelp.  The flyer ends with a statement that feedback helps them provide better service and keeps them viable and ends with "we love out patients".  The fact that the office is now offering incentives concerning reviews speaks volumes to me.  I for one felt that love a long time ago, but  the love has been replaced with a production oriented medical office.  If you want to be a part of a production line --this place is for you--the health care will be fine--but if you actually want a health care home and a meaningful relationship with your primary care provider--for me at least Camelback Health Care is no longer that place.

We specifically went to the hotel last night to listen to some jazz in the lobby hotel--knew the drinks were expensive but in the past --it has been great to listen music in that setting.  The website lists the music.  When we got there and asked the waiter when the music would start--they said--they hadn't had music for 8 months.  It would have been nice to have known up front that the music was no longer happening.  Please change your website to be more accurate in its representation.

Another great evening at FnB--We started out with the snap peas, potatoes and lamb meatballs and then went on to pasta with Italian bacon, roasted chicken and pork roast--Dessert was peach cake and chocolate cake that was wonderful everything had such rich flavor and flavors were so complementary.  One thing--as much as I like supporting Arizona Wines--thank you for expanding the wine list--and the price point--for wine--it is the icing on the cake--that dinner that is so sublime is more easily afforded.

We went to Talavera for restaurant week and the experience did not inspire me to want go back and pay full price for a meal.  The setting is magnificent but it can't make up for uneven service and just okay food.  We sat at the table for nearly 15 minutes before ever getting a menu or a glass of water--when we finally did get to order, the bottle of wine took an inordinately long time to come out.  The service did get better as the night went on--but the damage had been done.--and the food--it was just okay--not bad but I was expecting knock my socks off from a restaurant at this level. I have no strong interest in driving from central Phoenix for just okay food--when I can get great food in my own neighborhood for a fraction of the proce.

This review is for the casino and showroom.  We saw John Mayall in the showroom tonite--it is a great intimate concert space and had really good acoustics.  there was cocktail service in the room prior to the start of the concert and bar at the back of the space was open throughout the concert.  before and after the concert I played a little blackjack.  it was nice to have more than one $5 table.  All the dealers were nice and drink service was timely.  As was mentioned in other reviews--they do allow smoking in the casino--but there was pretty good circulation and most of the folks at the tables I sat at didn't smoke.  I will definitely go back both for concerts and a little blackjack.

Yes! Yes! Yes!  what a great addition to south Arcadia.  Even though I live in central phoenix--i know i will be going to Beckett's Table again and again.  We were there just for a glass of wine and a little something--we sat at the community table which was great fun.  the restaurant is terrific looking and well designed--spacious enough to be comfortable, but still as an intimate feel.  we only tasted the mac and cheese, the biscuits and the pecan pie but saw a lot of dishes that were ordered by our companions at the table--everything looked wonderful and had wonderful aromas.  Based on the biscuits and mac and cheese alone-I would have come back--both were flavorful and worth the calories--and the pecan/fig pie was wonderful--even though I don't like figs.    Can't wait to go back and start to work my way through the menu--congrats to the owners--for getting it just right!

Made it back for a full fledged dinner.  had the shepherd's pie--it was perfect for this kind of evening--just enough "comfort"  without being overwhelming and had a wonderful beef forward taste.  Also sampled the chicken and dumplings which was also terrific--so nice to be able to taste the chicken--gravy/sauce was again flavorful without overwhelming the dish.  came home satisfied but not feeling like I don't need to eat for a week.

this pains me to write this review--I have been to Beckett's Table several times and have always enjoyed the food, the ambiance and the service, but tonight was different.  I hope that tonite was an anomaly and the next time I go --things will be better.  Met three friends for dinner, two of us ordered from the restaurant week menu and two didn't.  Things started out great-- service started out attentive and stayed that way but for the fact that various servers kept bringing plates to our table that weren't ours--this didn't happen once but three times throughout the meal so things at our table were somewhat chaotic throughout the evening.  now to the food--for my appetizer, I ordered the chicken meatballs--which I quite liked except for the fact that the sauce was very warm (temperature wise) which was good, but the meatballs were cold in the middle which detracted from the flavor of the dish.  So when one of the servers came over--I  told him that I enjoyed the dish but that meatballs were cold and they might want to do something about that for when the serve them the rest of the evening (we were there early) okay so I chalked that up to timing in the kitchen--no big deal.  for my main dish--i ordered the bass which came on some greens--this dish was not advertised as a salad--so I expected the fish to come out warm which it didn't--it was almost cold--there are only certain fish that  taste good cold or not warm and bass in my opinion was not one of them.  so--i let the server know and he picked up my plate and took back to the kitchen--(at Beckett's Table the kitchen is open)--so I as I watch my fish being taken back and the waiter and Chef Beckett discuss it, the chef looked over at me and sneered.   REALLY???  I am the customer--i didn't ask for a substitution or a change in the flavor--I simply wanted the fish not to be cold--as the fish came back to me, I told the server my feelings were hurt that I should not be sneered at for simply asking for the fish be warmer than it was--he made some comments about the fact that it was served on greens--well I have to tell you I had a salmon salad at Kona Grill earlier in the day--and the salmon was warm even though it was on greens.  I like Becktett's Table and have always felt it was very welcoming--but tonite had enough mishaps--that I will think about going back there.  I want to go places where I appreciate the quality of the food and the chef/owner respects that the customers are his livelihood and treat them with some level of respect.

I had dinner at the True Food in Scottsdale on a Thursday a couple of weeks ago.  There is really nothing not to like here.  the restaurant itself is great looking and will be wonderful when the weather warms up as all the walls are glass doors.  I thought alcohol was well priced or least the wine was as you get glasses starting at $6.  we shared the lettuce cups as an appetizer and they were quite tasty although messy to eat as are all the dishes that use lettuce as a tortilla.  I had the puttanesca with a twist--no anchovies--instead with ahi tuna--it was quite tasty and was a right sized portion.  My sister in law had a tofu curry--that also was quite flavorful--even though I am not a fan of curry and can take or leave tofu.  head the chocolate cake for dessert which was just right.  I will definitely go back-all in all a pleasant evening.

kind of yucky--I debated on whether to do a two or three for the Garage--The restaurant itself is great looking, very industrial--great patio space on Bethany Home.  We went for lunch about 1:30--service was fine, but it took more than 20 minutes for the food to be served and all we ordered was 2 BLT's and a flatbread--and by that time there were maybe three other tables of folks--so they weren't exactly busy.  If you are going to do BLT's you should do them well--spend a little on wonderful tomatoes and put enough bacon on them to live up to their namesake--for $8--i expected more than a strip of bacon--They also put the sandwich on brioche--which is not the right bread for a BLT--the sandwich needs a dense bread--well toasted to offset the moisture in the mayo and tomatoes--this thing was hard to eat at best.  What was really awful though were the fries--first of all the potatoes had no taste and secondly they was a VERY NEGATIVE taste of oil that had been used way too many times--  I have to say a got home after this meal and didn't feel right the rest of the day.  I can see going back to the garage for a drink at the bar--but it will not be on my list for lunch or any other meal  I think these "mechanics" need to go back for some more training on quality.

Good food, reasonably priced, great vibe--what more can one say --other than so glad you are in the neighborhood!  lots of folks biking or walking over for dinner--outside patio is terrific--we got there at six--lots of families--by the time we left at 7:30 transitioning to more adults.  I hope to be a regular.

This is not a review about the food because there was no room at the inn.  I walked into barrio queen at a little after 6:00 pm on a saturday--I would say there were people at a third to half of the tables--the hostess says they are completely booked for the evening and could not take walk-ins until at least 9--walked down Stetson--and there were tables at several other restaurants in the neighborhood--if they had tables I find it difficult that barrio queen was completely booked even though they were half empty.  not sure I will try again.

Trattoria Bianco is back to one restaurant that serves both pizza and other delights.  This review is not so much about the food or the service--but an attitude.    I did a large party of 12 on a Friday night--I attempted to make the reservation almost a month ago not by calling but actually by going to the restaurant.  At the time I thought we were going to be a party of 16--if you are over the magic number of 15--you have to do a pre planned meal and it must be at least $30 per person--I had offered to do a pre planned menu--but did not want to be at a $30 per person price point--dealing with all the machinations around the rules--was difficult at best--and made me almost walk away and find someplace else.  Anyway as it turns out--we were a party of 12--6 or 7 of us got there early and they would not seat us until all the party was there -- one of my family members (male) asked to see the manager and it was only through this second intervention-that  we were able to sit at our table at 5:45 instead of 6.    I love this restaurant--I love the  food as did everyone in the party.  Our server was terrific.  Our bill was very close to $500 and for that--it would be so much nicer to have felt that we were welcomed instead of having all these little rules and machinations.  I know if we had not been there --that they would have filled the table, I get that, but I guess I want to feel this is my neighborhood restaurant where I can bring friends and family for a celebration or just a great evening and be welcomed to enjoy the hospitality of Chris Bianco's restaurant.  Instead the evening was colored by the attitude that came from the person at the door and the manager--who made a parting shot at my family member about the favor they had done us by seating the party 15 minutes early. I guess it just makes me sad.

It pains me to write this review--I want so badly to like the Astor House--I love the Tuck Shop and never have had a bad meal there.  but things are just not right at the Astor House--we ate there last night on Halloween.  What a missed marketing opportunity--Trick and Treaters kept stopping by --we heard many saying we had no idea this place was here.  instead of handing out a coupon for a macaroon with lunch--the staff did nothing and were actually kind of funky when people walked in.    The Astor House needs to get an identity--the "service" is just funky--neither a cafeteria nor service--you would think with 4 people in the restaurant--you would not have to go to the end of the counter and pick up your "tray" of food.  the tables are wobbly and the chairs are uncomfortable--things that I wouldn't care about if the food was good.  On to the food--I may have a bias because I spent a lot of time in Kansas City and know what good barbecue is--what is being served is not.  the meat continues to be dry and the sauces are yucky--they are two sweet or weirdly spiced.--the one highlight was the link--chicken and garlic was good.  The food is served in paper on trays--all i can say is yuck!--we had to ask for paper plates--which at least made the eating process tolerable..  the Astor House is in a great neighborhood--but even the neighbors who can walk there are either going to go to the Tuck Shop or walk a few more blocks to 7th st to restaurants that have much better food.  I will definitely be back to the Tuck Shop over and over again, but am done with the Astor House--have been there several times--and it is just not right--they need to find out what the neighbors want and be that--coffee, sandwich, drinks and snacks--do --something well and be at the level of the Tuck Shop instead of a pretend cafeteria-- .

Don't bother unless you happen to be down there with money to burn.  I have to say--that after you find the place--the look of the space is wonderful and I could see sitting and having a drink--but for the money I will go someplace else.  I made a reservation--we did not arrive together --even though other than the bar, the place was empty--they initially sat us at two different tables--i also got an email from Open Table saying the reservation had been cancelled--which I assume means that they didn't think we showed up--even though they sat the party twice.    on to the food--the food is overpriced, small portions and underwhelming.  we started with a little, tiny bowl of mac and cheese--there are so many places in town that have taken this to an art form--this place isn't one of them.  two friends got one of the salads and didn't even finish it even though they split because it wasn't very good.  one friend ordered the chicken fried chicken sliders which they serve  on this little wooden platter--why?  they were messy and pieces of chicken were falling to the table.  I had the scallops and they were just okay--but certainly not worth the price.  on to the service--to many servers too much time --at one point there were five people providing service and at other times you could have bowled in the place and not hit a server--service was off and on and did not lend anything to the meal.  i probably won't be back--there are so many other places to go --that have really good food, great service and prices that don't make you feel liked someone just picked your pocket.

I have been to the NASH a couple of times now--both to see Carmen Ramirez and her band--both evenings were great--the music is good and room is a great intimate setting for jazz.  They let you bring in a bottle of wine or some beer which makes the evening very affordable--will look forward to other opportunities to go listen to music there.

I am so lucky to live in the Upward Projects Group Triangle--With the addition of Federal Pizza--my little part of the world has three great restaurants in walking distance--Federal Pizza is my favorite because i don't have to cross central and its the closest to my house.:)   Anyway--on to the food we shared a salad and a pizza and both hit a perfect note--salad had beets and pears in a great citrus vinaigrette--just enough to clear the palate--tonite we had a margherita pizza--crust was perfectly done and held up under the flavorful juicy tomatoes-- my only suggestion is that I would appreciate if there were a couple of wines by the glass and a price point closer to 7 instead of 9--but other than that--the restaurant itself is great looking as well, casual and modern.  It was also nice to see lots of folks who seem to know each other--certainly a great addition to  our neighborhood.

Sometimes it is the little things that finally throw you over the edge.  I have been back to Gertrude's a few times since my first review--I got a membership because I knew I would have lots of opportunities to take folks to the Chuhily exhibit.   As a result because Gertrude's is there I have ended up eating there.  Each time the experience has been impacted either by food that is bland to terrible to service that is so off and on.  Today however has given me the resolve to not go back.  Had breakfast there with a friend--ordered hot tea--they had no honey--for me not having honey is like for some folks not being able to drink black coffee.  Okay I get it sometimes you run out of things.  breakfast was two eggs, bacon, one slice of toast and six or seven fingerling potatoes--price point $12--not exactly inexpensive, but i get that the setting is gorgeous--food was okay--neither the best or worst eggs I have ever had  but here comes the little thing----they charge for jam for your one piece of toast.  they brought two tablespoons in a little bowl and for the privilege of having a little something sweet on your toast, you are charged a $1.50--but it's homemade they said--  In theory--I would hope that a restaurant at the level Gertrude's is attempting to be--that everything is homemade.  This charge offended my sensibilities of fairness and reasonableness--it can only be a slippery slope down to charging if you want silverware to eat with.    That's it--I won't be back--for a $12 breakfast, a tablespoon of jam (which is what was used)  should not have a surcharge--  I am not sure what the Gertrude's business model is, but I hope there is some planning ahead when there are no longer stunning works of art to  lure people in--I can't imagines locals coming to this restaurant--just because---there are so many other choices--some also with views, who have the sense that good business model for exceptional dining experiences is not to nickle and dime people.

I had dinner at the Salty Sow for the first time and will definitely be back.  Thought the truffle deviled eggs were full of flavor.  Also had the crisped chicken thighs with potatoes--the chicken was crispy and moist--really some of the best chicken I have ever had--the potatoes were also had a great deal of flavor.  A dining companion had the chili rubbed tuna--which she said had wonderful flavor--hope to try that another time.

North Mountain has definitely hit its stride--vibe is good, live music some nights and the food just keeps getting better.  Had the poutine  recently--it was great and the fries were crispy.  Beer continues to be great for people with all tastes and level of beer knowledge.

Can't wait to have dinner here.  Met some friends for happy hour.  The location is still the wonderful little cottage--with lots of light and still the rustic paneling in the bar area.  I only had a couple of glasses of wine and the french fries--but it makes me want to come back for more--the truffle ketchup as a dip for the fries was incredible and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside--clearly Binks knows the that fries are an art and not a science.  Can't wait to have dinner.

Finally got to have dinner here last night and it was everything I expected to be.  We started with a carafe of wine and a couple of appetizers.  The meatballs the night we were there were Asian inspired and very tasty.  One friend had the special--which was roasted pork that they had done during the day--it was very flavorful.  I had the gazpacho which is just wonderful--it is a creamy orange red and such a great flavor--I  also had the sand dabs--the fish was done perfectly--for dessert we had  a peach sorbet--that was flashed frozen at the table--also excellent.  Service was just as you expect--there when you needed him but not intrusive.   Looking forward to the next time I go --which is in August.

We happened into Solo on a Friday night.  We shared the burrata, beet salad, and the gnocchi--all of which was quite good.  the gnocchi was light and complemented the sauce.  Because they were having a quiet night, they also offered us tastes of two other pastas, both of which were tasty and inventive.  Solo is family owned and is still getting established having been opened for just a few weeks.  Certainly worth another trip.

Coming back from Target and wanted a quick bite--so I thought I would stop--The parking lot was crowded and I thought oh good --it is doing well--but I was wrong--everyone except one person was obviously having lunch at Mucho Macho Taco.  the grocery has wine, pastries, french cheeses, banquettes and a nice little lunch menu--so I am very confused as to why the place is empty.  I ordered a grilled cheese to go--$6.  not much I admit and it was good, but it was just thrown into its plastic container with no care or company--a couple of pieces of cantaloupe or other melon would have complemented the sandwich very well.  There were three staff there--and all I can say meh--i have experienced better.  If you are going to use the word French in your name you should honor that legacy.   The French are concerned not only with the quality of the food but also its presentation and the company it keeps.  I was in this place at 12;45 and it was empty--I can't imagine what is keeping them open--It is kind of sad--with a little engagement and a little more care with the space--it could be a great little place.

We went on a Thursday night--I had family in from out of town and went back and forth about going there because the reviews are all over the map.  We had a great table in a back corner--the restaurant was busy but not jammed.  We started with medley of oysters--all of which were outstanding.  My family members who have traveled all over the world--indicated that they were some of the best.  They definitely reminded you of the ocean--by their taste and smell.  Main dishes included risootto, the spaghetti with sturgeon and the linguine with cuttlefish.  All three dishes were excellent--the fish and seafood in all its forms tasted very fresh.  it was so nice to have seafood in Phoenix where you can taste it rather than it being swallowed by the taste of whatever it came with.    I will definitely come back--lots of other things on the menu I want to try.  the restaurant is very modern looking.  they do have vespas around the raw bar to sit on--a little kitchy--and I am not sure how comfortable--but certainly a conversation starter.

I always have high hopes for family owned Italian restaurants.  I hope for incredibly flavored food at a neighborhood price point.  Villa Italia doesn't score on either point.  When we walked in at 6 we were the only patrons--never a good sign.  During the hour we were there, another couple of people came in and i think one person came in and picked up a to go order.  As we were leaving it looked like a party of six or so were coming in--but that was it.  the entire time we were there--we only saw one staff person.  I have no idea how she would have handled things if they had been busy.  She was very nice--but not knowledgeable about the wine or the food.  We asked her questions and she indicated that in some cases she had not tried the food she was serving--that is a warning sign for me.    Restaurants like this one--should do just a few things and do them very well.  Unfortunately nothing was knock your socks off --little family italian place good.  We shared calamari--which were overbreaded and had no taste.  I had egg plant Parmesan--which had very little flavor.  My dining companion had chicken ravioli--she indicated that she could tell they were homemade but were drowning in sauce.  The wine was a small pour and over priced--which kind of adds insult to injury.  I think in general--prices for everything were a $1 or $2 higher than they should have been--I would have felt much better if the entree had included a small salad--but that was separate and $5 to boot.  My wine was $7 a glass and for the pour and the brand should have been closer to $5.  So the short and the long--this will not be on my rotation--It is not worth going back--the quality is about the same as a chain restaurant or a little below.  A meal that was almost $40 and should have been closer to $25 or $30.  Too expensive for too little.    Given their location, they are going to have to step up their game considerably for people to take the time to find them and patronize them.  I wish them luck

We stopped by on a rainy Saturday--it was great timing --we were able to sit down at the counter immediately.  We ordered the chips to start.  We are a family who likes our fried foods well done or extra crispy---these did not disappoint and the dip they come with is fantastic.  We all ordered burgers.  They are very good--but I know now that I will order a little differently next time--they were a little too pink for my tastes--not their fault--they were exactly as they were described on the menu. next time I will order a little more well done--which will also give a chance for the cheese to melt a little more.  We shared a couple of ice cream sandwiches (which were given to us for free for a little tiny mix up on ordering--how cool is that--what great service)  as the rain stopped it started to fill up.  by the way the building is great looking--so simple, but there is something sublime about it and loved the McIntosh vintage amplifier--spitting out the tunes.    Will definitely be back to sample some more of the menu.

All I can say--don't bother--I had the turkey and it tasted just like I had opened a deli pack--slimy and way, way, too salty--absolutely no flavor--coleslaw was also unremarkable--none of my dining companions commented on the food--presentations were unremarkable--brisket that friend ordered looked very dry-service was fine.  spend your dining dollar elsewhere.  PS-if you are expecting anything vaguely resembling something that would come out of a bbq  joint-you will be sadly disappointed.  they should not be allowed to use smokehouse in their name.

The Henry is terrific--the space is great looking and very inviting.  They were packed on a Saturday afternoon so we sat at the bar--which was terrific--I wasn't in the mood for day drinking so I had a virgin mary--it was fabulous--can't wait to go back and do the make your own thing--had breakfast--just simple eggs and potatoes --everything was just right and one of the best breakfasts I have had in a long time.  Definitely plan to go back and try some of the other dishes.

Met a friend last night for a glass of wine.  Although we didn't eat, I plan to go back soon as the menu looked great.  Service was terrific even though we were just having wine.  My only concern is that the price point for wine is just a little high.  I understand why--but my comfort zone is always closer to 8/9 for a glass.  Anyway-they did a great job on the interior--still has some of the sportsman's feel and still just as warm and inviting.  looking forward to trying the food.

this is more a comment than a review--I love Postinos.  I live in a neighborhood where I can walk to one--I have to say that I like mine a lot better than the one in Tempe--I get it--I am not the target demographic for the Tempe location.  Nonetheless--the kinetic energy that is the service went from ---oh great service to leave us the f**** alone--Either put water pitchers on the table or put signs on the table that can be flipped--water no water--the amount of interruptions was overwhelming until you actually needed  something.  in addition to water being poured every three minutes, was the individual clearing of the little carafes for wine or a single fork or plate that wasn't used.  Individual pieces cleared every time a server came by.  If you want to turn the tables at break neck speed at this location just say so--and let me manage my time--tell me you want me to gone in 30 minutes--I get it--and will respectthat-the kinetic service was really disruptive to conversation and time with a good friend.  Will I be back?  Probably--but I am bringing signs the next time so I can clearly communicate when I need/want service and when I want to sit and enjoy my wine and the conversation at the table without constant interruption     On another note--as with the other Postinos--it is a great looking restaurant and the food is always enjoyable.

Had lunch with a friend at Ocotillo.  There is only good to say.  The restaurant, inside and out, is great looking and I am sure will be place for great times and memories.  My friend and I both had the hamburger with fries.  Simply done but so good--I asked for fries well done and they listened.  The menu provides lots of options for everyone from vegetarian to carnivore.  Service was well paced and helpful without being intrusive.  Looking forward to another visit soon.

I have had drinks and dinner at Buck and Rider a few times now.  I have to say that the seafood is always terrific, fresh and flavorful.  Last night however,  really gave me an impression of the quality of this restaurant--if only they were all this way.  We were celebrating a birthday.  Orders included salmon (excellent!) whitefish of the day (excellent!), calamari (excellent!) and two orders of seafood gumbo --when the gumbo came--there was no doubt there was sausage but no seafood--we confirmed with wait staff that it was supposed to be seafood gumbo--she said yes --clearly the seafood part of the gumbo--didn't make it in the bowl--I made another comment to her --as i handed her my empty bowl--as the liquid part of the gumbo was very good--one of my eating companions had not finished hers--so there was clear evidence that the seafood had not made it to  the party.  The way the restaurant handled this really shows the quality of the management. The wait staff apologized and said she would let the kitchen know immediately--the manager came over shortly thereafter--apologized again and took the cost of both orders off the bill--In addition the dessert we had ordered was also comped.    In this day and age  with the level of rudeness and crassness that surrounds us everywhere--it was so nice to feel respected and that staff had the authority to make things right--Buck and Rider will continue to be on my go to list--because of this and of course the quality of the food.

Went here for brunch--we got there at 10:30 and the place was almost empty--understandable because of being a holiday.  the restaurant is nice looking--I had a typical breakfast and the food was fine--nothing interesting.  There is something off about this place--the service wasn't bad--but it wasn't right--here are things that were strange.  I am a tea drinker--i ordered hot tea and the only tea bag they had was chamomile.  I know how  herbal teas are popular now-- all that they had was chamomile-a very odd choice as it is usually used at night to calm ones' nerves (oh wait--maybe now I understand)--there wasn't a black tea--ie. earl grey, english breakfast or even a lipton tea bag available--so i ended up not having tea this morning  (which does make a girl cranky)--my friend and i ordered a drink--they brought her gruet first and then after several minutes brought my virgin mary--really they couldn't bring the drinks together?  it is not like the place was overwhelmed.  They overcharged my friend for her gruet--only by a $1 but made no effort to resolve it even after my friend brought it to their attention.  As we were leaving--now about 11:30 they posted their $5 specials on mimosas--did our server mention this when my friend ordered the gruet?  Nope.  the menu is trendy--but not particularly interesting--they would have been better off with doing a straight ahead menu and doing it well.  there is something off about this place--maybe because they are still working stuff out-I might go back because friends want to go there--but it would not be a place that will come to mind that I want to return too--
