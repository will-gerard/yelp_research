I couldn't have more good things to say about Jose and his company. The prices are unbelievably resonable, his work is beautiful and his beat his own deadline by a week. I just picked up my wingback chair   from him and can't wait to use him again. Five stars isn't enough.

Bobbie's never fails!! Best florist in town. The prices are great, service is excellent and most importantly the quality and presentation of their bouquets is amazing. 5 out of 5 every time!!!

So frustrating. They take your name and number from their caller ID but when your pizza is running 45-minutes late they don't call you? This is the second time I've been here and been extremely disappointed. Prices are great but the service is the opposite. We'll take our business elsewhere for sure.
