It really does pain me to rate Sunrise so poorly, as they are one of the few decent restaurants in Maricopa. TWICE now my wife has found a hair in her salad. Hairs in food are not all that uncommon in the restaurant industry, but it always leads me to the question, "If they're skimping on the hair nets, what other practices are they overlooking?" Washed hands? Clean cooking utensils? It's just bad form. We ordered the Monte Cristo and mozzarella sticks in addition to the salad. Both tasted like the oil for frying needed to be replaced. The Monte was so bad we sent it back and left. The service was good as always but the food was SO disappointing. I love their breakfast burritos but they won't be getting our business for a very long time.

The food was IN.CRED.ABLE. We had the prime rib and the rib eye with blue cheese crumbles. Both were cooked to perfection and were paired with the best creamy horseradish we have ever had. With two sides per dish, the prices were fairly reasonable. Atmosphere was great The wait to be seated was negligible for the time of day and year. The only thing lacking was the service. It was quite slow especially considering the number of tables our server had. Otherwise, top notch!

Great food! Environment is very..unique. Pork chili sandwich was the bomb and my wife had the artichoke grilled cheese and said it was the BEST sandwich she had ever had!! Service was friendly and prompt and the prices were reasonable.

I'm back again for a follow-up because my prescription for my contacts seems a bit weak. I had a 9:30 appointment and showed up one minute late with contacts in hand. They have a female staff member who seems a bit more friendly/customer service oriented. I didn't see the doctor until 10:45. I won't be back.
