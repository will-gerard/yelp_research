My husband said the Carnita sandwich was the best sandwich he's had in a LONG time.

Worst, more horrible, awful service and hotel stay I have EVER had. And I travel a LOT. I'm in Vegas 2-3 times a year and have NEVER experienced this degree of incompetency!  Ok, now that you understand the degree of awfulness, where to begin:  I booked and paid online reservation which includes early check in and late check out (for $60-80 extra) because I knew our plane arrived at noon. We waited in an hour long line to be told that rooms weren't available until 2pm and that she "couldn't see" our early check in reservation. We dropped off luggage with bell desk and went to pub for lunch and a drink and to waste the first 2 hours of our vacation.   At 2pm, I called and was rudely informed that check in time was 3pm actually so I still needed to wait some more.  At 3:05pm, they finally called to give us our room number. If every single room needed to be available by 3pm, why were we the last to get a room if we had already waited for 3 freaking hours!?!?!  We get to room at 3:15 and I call for luggage. Told it will take 5-15 minutes and not to leave the room while we wait for it. After 45 minutes, I call back to be told "oops, our ticket must not have printed so your luggage is still sitting here. It will right up". No apology.  Luggage finally arrives around 4:15 (another hour wasted) and the main handle on the large piece of luggage is broken off!! The bell man doesn't mention this but when I see it and ask him he tells me that it was already like that. Um, NO it was NOT.  We have finally had enough and call hotel management. Joey, the customer service rep, tells me that she CAN SEE my early check in and out payments, doesn't know why the front desk lady couldn't. SCREAM!. She then offers to refund the resort fees (about $25/day) and 2 free breakfast meals (about $50 value). That is clearly not enough to make up this mess but at this point we are just wanting to get down to the pool and start the vacation.  After relaxing and partying for two days, we verify we have late check out so that we can sleep in and catch later flight. We do. Yay! Since we got in about 5am, we needed to sleep past the normal 11am-noon check out. Except apparently the housekeeping staff didn't get this memo, or didn't even bother to check because TWICE that afternoon while we were still trying to sleep, they knocked loudly and entered our room. Yes, entered. The MGM rooms did not have a door lock or deadbolt so without jamming a door under the handle, there is NO way to keep unwanted people from just opening your door and looking inside! They did not apologize, just closed the door and walked off. We tried to go back to sleep. And then they did it a 2nd time. Are you freaking kidding me?!?  We go to check out and guess what has NOT been applied to our bill. The refunds. And the front desk tells me that the offer was for 2 free breakfast buffets, not room service, so she will only credit one of them. Again, at this point, I was so ready to get out of there that I didn't care.   I will NEVER EVER stay at MGM again and recommend you don't either.

Great service. The mushroom brie soup was really good.   Chicken Club and Quad City Melt sandwiches were both yummy as well.
