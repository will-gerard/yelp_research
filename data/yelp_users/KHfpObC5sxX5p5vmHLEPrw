Moved to Phoenix in July and as a native New Yorker, one of my greatest worries was that I wouldn't be able to find decent pizza anywhere. It may or may not have kept me up a night or two... ;) First day in Phoenix: I'm starving, the movers haven't arrived, and I don't have anything to consume in my new place.  I drive down the street and see Famous Ray's.  I say, "hell, you're gonna have to start somewhere." I go inside.  Typical NY style pizza joint.  Order at the counter, pay, get your drink, have a seat...they'll call you when it's ready. The folks working the counter are definitely from NY (in case you couldn't tell by their ridiculously strong accents and all of the NY sport posters strewn across the wall).  Getting a good vibe so far. My name is called and I eagerly retrieve my pizza.  It looks just like what I'd get in NY.  More good vibes!  I taste it and I'm in heaven.  Seriously, it's so good that I have never been to another pizza place since I moved to Phoenix because I honestly don't have to (or want to!).   They have an everyday special of 2 slices and a fountain drink for $5.00 (can't beat that with a stick). They don't do delivery (boo), but I don't care.  I'd drive 50 miles for this pizza. Seriously, I think the stars aligned on my first day in the Valley of the Sun.  How else could you possibly explain how I found my pizza soul mate on my very first day here???   Moral of the story is: if you want legit NY style pizza, Famous Rays is your place.

I've been going to Fancy Nails since I moved to PHX in July of last year based on the Yelp* reviews and have never been disappointed.  This is the first salon I have been to in a long time where I don't have a specific technician work on my nails.  Every person in the salon does a great job.  I am fortunate to be out of work before 3pm during the week so I can get to Fancy Nails by about 3:15...I've never had to wait for a service when I arrive around that time.  I have been on weekends and it does get busy, so I'd recommend you make an appointment.  The salon stocks OPI shellac/gel polish in addition to some other brands I don't recognize. A gel manicure costs $25. For all of my pedicure people, Fancy Nails uses disposable pedi tub inserts so no worries about someone else's foot funk touching your tootsies (big plus)!  They have a few options for pedicures, so ask to see the menu before you start.  They also offer waxing services and tanning as well but I can't comment on them since I've never used them. The salon is clean, well stocked, and everyone is always professional and courteous.  There are plenty of other nail salons closer to where I live but I choose to come to Fancy Nails.  They're everything I was looking for in a nail salon!

Went here today to have one of my acrylic nails repaired and both thumbs repainted with gel polish after a got a shoddy fill from another salon.  I was immediately shamed by the woman I was talking to who asked me why I don't just go back to the salon where I originally went. I told her that I didn't want to pay that salon to do more shoddy work.  The woman then grabbed by hand and began lecturing me about my polish selection saying that it would be impossible to match my nail color unless I knew the name of it.  I DID  know the name and brand and told her what it was...then she was pissed because she actually had to look for the color in a cabinet.   She couldn't find the color so a male came over and in 2 seconds, handed her the bottle. She then began speaking in Vietnamese to the guy (in a really upset tone) and walked me to her station.   She then proceeded to sigh and roll her eyes as she aggressively ground the nail polish off of my hands with her Dremmel tool.  She did a half-assed repair on my nail, put the gel polish right over the acrylic dust she buffed off of my nails, and gave me a paint job that I could have easily given myself  with my right hand (I'm left handed).  I couldn't wait to get out of there.   She charged me $6 for the work (it wasn't worth a DIME more) and even though she was a total biyatch, I still have her a 5 dollar tip.  She doesn't even look at me as I hand her the money and then just walks away. That was it. Ooooooooookkay... I have no idea who peed in this woman's Cheerios today, but she was unnecessarily rude to a perfectly nice, paying customer.  I have never been treated as rudely as  was today when visiting a nail salon.  I will never return to this place.  Ever. I have no idea how this salon has the star rating it does.  It was dirty, outdated, and staffed by that hideous woman.  You've been warned.

Seriously?  How did I miss this place?  I drive by it at least once a day but never stopped in until about a month ago.  It's a small storefront in a strip mall wedged between Bosa Donuts and Goodwill at the corner of Union Hills and 7th St. so it's kind of easy to miss.  Head inside and there are about 8 tables and a menu with photos hung above the register.  Go to the counter, order your food, and the folks there will bring it out to you when it's ready.  In the meantime, you'll get a free basket of chips and you have access to their small but ample salsa bar.  When your food arrive, that's when the magic happens.  Each dish is expertly prepared and presented in a way that rivals your high brow expensive Mexican chains, but with one difference...the place is legit.  No boil in bag garbage or pre made stuff here.  One woman in the kitchen uses her amazing skills to give you traditional, authentic Mexican.  Their quesadillas are out of this world, their street tacos are outrageous, and their enchiladas will leave you at a loss for words.  The best part?  It's so inexpensive.  I feel like I rob them each time I eat there.  For less than $10 bucks you leave stuffed with unbelievable food.

Had never been here before until yesterday.  Came with a girlfriend for dinner.  Decided to get the Coastal Trio to try a variety of their tacos.  I LOVED the classic fish taco. That was definitely my favorite, followed by the salsa verde shrimp taco (super yum).  The last taco was the Regal Springs Tilapia taco and it was so spicy, I could hardly eat it. Either the blackening spices or the serrano slaw made this a must for those who adore spicy things, but it definitely burned the crap out of my dainty little taste buds so beware if you're sensitive to spice. They have $1.50 classic fish tacos on Tuesdays which is a steal.  I'm definitely coming back to take advantage of that.  The salsa bar was well stocked and the salsa verde was delicious.  The lady behind the register was very nice and happily delivered our food to our table one it was ready.  Overall, I had a great experience.  This is definitely not fine dining, but you can escape the heat, take a seat, and nosh on some pretty kick a** tacos in between getting your shopping fix.

The first time I was here it was during the day and it was empty.  It's a huge place with probably 20 pool tables and 8 electronic dart boards.  The waitresses wear Hooters-esque referee uniforms and are usually efficient and pleasant.  They have beer you can order in huge mugs for dirt cheap.  They're always served cold and are perfect for an escape of the Arizona heat. One thing that really turned me off on my last visit (Friday, July 23) was the foul-mouthed, loud bouncer/door man that was at the door when we came in.  My girlfriend and I both said hello to him but he didn't even acknowledge us.  He was in the middle of talking about some "f-ing guy who f'ed with the wrong dude and how sh*t was gonna go down if he ever f'in saw him again."  OK, doorman warrior, how about you just check our ID's so we don't have to listen to your roided-out tirade about your ass kicking skills?  Thanks. As the night progressed the patrons became increasingly more sketchy.  We decided to beat feet around 10pm due to that.  The parking lot is horribly lit and there were all sorts of "interesting" characters walking around who I am guessing were guests at the pay by the hour directly behind the bar. If I come back, it'll be during the day.

This is a great Big Lots.  It's clean, well organized, and the stock is always in great condition.  The staff always greets you at the door, and will happily inform you of any sales or promotions within the store. I just moved to Phoenix and was able to purchase a really nice patio bistro set for $60 (table/2chairs).  They have other inexpensive patio furniture available as well. If you sign up to be a member of their rewards program they will send you coupons and 4 times a year they have an event where you get 20% off everything in the store.  That's a nice plus if you plan on making a larger purchase, like for furniture.

Great place to watch some Arizona Coyotes games!  Although I am a Devils fan at heart, I still frequent here to get my hockey fix.  You can always find free parking although you'll have to walk farther to get to the stadium (get that cardio in, peeps!).  If you arrive early, there are plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops to waste a little bit of time in before the game.   Once inside, the arena itself is easy to navigate, but there are plenty of ushers on hand to help you if you've lost your way.  There are some standard food selections inside (hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, beer) but there are also some specialty vendors who sell fare like poutine (yum!).  Nothing like noshing on some gravy fries smothered in cheese curds to get you in the Coyote spirit. One thing that always makes me kind of sad is how empty the arena always seems to be during game time.  I guess Arizonans aren't into hockey like the other parts of the US.  The upside to this is that there is always plenty of seating to move to if you don't like the location of the tickets you bought.  The arena is always having drawings and promotions.  I actually watched a guy shoot a goal on the ice and win a BMW!  Lucky dude, for sure! So head out, support your local Arizona Coyotes, and have a good time!

Love this place.  Really good food and delicious craft beers from all around the country.  The place is also packed with eye candy for the ladies...whoever does the hiring here definitely selected some good looking men (thank you!).  The wait staff is also very efficient and plentiful.  You'll never have to search for someone to help you out.   It's a good mixed crowd for happy hour and they have some decent booze/food specials if you happen to be there during those hours.  I've had the steak salad, fish tacos, and a burger on my visits and they have all been delicious.  I like the open air kitchen that you can check out while waiting for your food to be prepared too.  I love fruity beers and Yard House has an entire section for me to choose from.  I've had the blueberry, pineapple, and peach ales and really liked each one.  For those of you who don't like that type of beer, I guarantee there is something on their menu you'll be excited to try.     If you are looking for a place to go on a Friday or Saturday night that is fun but not crazy and outrageous (like Sandbar), give this place a try.  I've always found the vibe to be laid back and they play some decent music inside.

Super yummy sandwiches, sides, and a bakery to boot!  The place gets packed at lunch so come early or be prepared to wait a few minutes for service.  With that being said, they were very efficient with taking care of the influx of guests that were there at the same time I was.  Overall, the location was very clean, employees nice, and the food was very fresh and tasty.  I had a roast beef sandwich with a side and a delicious fresh brewed iced tea.  They have free Wi-Fi to use while you're there as well.  If I'm back in the area I'll definitely stop my again.

Seriously, what's not to LOVE about Costco? Clothes, food, tires, gas, florist, pharmacy...this store has it all.  This particular Costco is always immaculate (with the exception of the clothes area because people are slobs and destroy it).  One thing that sets this Costco apart from the ones I have been to on the East Coast is that every day they give out food samples.  Back East you could only get samples on the weekends.  I've tried some really good stuff (kale, chicken garlic ravioli, pumpkin bread, Vitamix smoothies, coconut snacks, tea) and it has all been delicious.  The price of $55 per year for a standard (Gold) membership pays for itself with the discounts in gas alone.  As a single girl living on my own, I don't need to buy food in bulk so I basically have the membership for toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent, razor blades, and gas.  The gas prices are normally 10-20 cents cheaper per gallon than the gas stations in the immediate area and there are 15 or so gas pumps to accommodate people wanting to fuel their vehicles.   I definitely prefer Costco to Sam's Club and love coming here.  I always walk out with stuff I don't need but simply have to have!  Good for Costco, bad for my wallet.

Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. This place is off the chain good.  Came here with my boyfriend this past Sunday afternoon after seeing all of the awesome Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.  The place was PACKED and we waited about 20 minutes for a table.  No biggie.  I'll wait for good food.  We were seated and ordered two agua frescas (one strawberry (for him) and a watermelon (for me)) along with two of their famous tortas.  About 20 minutes later our drinks and food came out together.  I wish the drinks came out sooner (I was thirsty), but again, the place was packed and the boyfriend and I were engaged in conversation anyway.   Tortas?  Bomb!  Agua Frescas?  Bomb!  Definitely a fork and knife kind of sandwich (it's huge!).  I preferred my watermelon agua fresca to his strawberry, but they were both yumm-o. The boyfriend couldn't say enough good things about his torta (he'd never had one)  and I was so pleased to know that I had found the amazing Mexican restaurant I had been searching for since relocating to Phoenix in July.  I'm still perplexed as to why there is such a lack of decent Mexican food here! The menu is diverse and carries many other items besides tortas so check it out.  Also, Adam Richman from Man vs Food came here to film a food challenge episode.  You'll immediately know by the wall sized photos of him strewn throughout the restaurant.  Bring your peeps and an appetite and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  I can't wait to come back and try more stuff!

Fun little hole in the wall bar in Old Town Scottsdale right off of the main drag.  Cheap drinks for the area, and the atmosphere is super laid back.  It seems to have a mixed crowd (some college age kids mixed in with some old timers), but it definitely does not have that pretentious Scottsdale vibe that one will find all to easily in the same area. There is a ping pong table outside as well as some semi-outdoor covered seating (no A/C misters though). I've been here twice and both times used Patti's as a stop between establishments.  Even though I didn't spend a ton of time inside, I felt comfortable in this place.  It definitely has a "come as you are" vibe to it.   If you are looking for a chill place to go with friends and rock your not so fancy clothes, go to Patti's.  It's a cool little place.

Great cafe right outside of my office (City Square).  It's always busy, but the lines move quickly and they manage to get your food out in a reasonable amount of time.  The owners (husband and wife duo) are always there working the counter or in the back and are extremely pleasant.  With regards to the food, you get pretty large portions and the quality is always good.  I once had a chopped salad there (on special) and it rivaled some of the fancier restaurants I've been to.  I tend to get the salad with tuna and for $6.50, it's more than sufficient for lunch.  The drinks are very cheap as well...right around $1.25 for a huge cup!  My coworkers hit the cafe up every morning for coffee and usually for lunch since there aren't very many options in the area.   Most of the items on the menu are $7.00 or less, which is a great price for lunch downtown.  They have everything from breakfast sandwiches, to pancakes and french toast, to burgers, to wraps, to salads.  You name it, they've pretty much got it.  If you need a quick spot to grab lunch and you're in the immediate area, definitely stop in.

I love the Yard House!  Until I moved to PHX, I can honestly say that I was a total anti craft beer snob.  I always felt as if drinking a craft beer would magically transport you to Hipsterville and I'd be forced to listen to obscure music while riding a tricked out bicycle wearing a beanie hat in the desert.  Well guess what, people?  It doesn't happen!  Rejoice knowing that craft beer is DELICIOUS and won't make you a pretentious snob. ;) The restaurant is always packed and for good reason.  Their food is awesome, and ranges from salads to burgers to steak and everything else in between.  I've tried many options on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The staff is well versed in their offerings and will be more than happy to provide you a recommendation on their tasty food.  I also like the open air kitchen...if you don't want to watch sports on their seemingly endless number of televisions, you can watch the chefs hustle throughout the kitchen working their magic. Beer?  They've got it.  The beer menu is just as long as the food menu and doesn't disappoint.  They've done less saavy drinkers such as myself a solid and broken down the beers into types and flavors.  For instance, if you're looking for a fruity ale, just go to the fruit beer section.  It makes selecting a drink you're bound to love a breeze.  My two favorites are Four Peak's Peach Ale and San Tan's Mr. Pineapple.  You've just gotta try those if you like fruity beer like I do.  Mucho delicioso!   The Yard House also has a pretty solid Happy Hour with deals on drinks and food.  The clientele ranges from kiddos to businessmen and has a fun, lively vibe.  Definitely check the Yard House out if you want good food, good drinks, and fun.

Went here last Sunday for the first time since moving to Arizona since I had heard such good things.  My friend and I were immediately seated and browsed the expansive menu which consisted of both breakfast and lunch options.  Since we were both out partying the night before, we opted for breakfast even though it was 12:30 in the afternoon.  I ordered the classic eggs benedict while my friend ordered the apple pancake platter.  Our server was really, really good at what she did.  We never had to ask for anything, she was super sweet, and very knowledgeable of the menu and substitution options.   When our food arrived, it was simple in presentation.  Nothing to "wow" you but here's where they blew me away.  I haven't had a true poached egg in years (most places destroy poached eggs since they're not easy to cook).  Mine were perfect.  Imagine my surprise as I cut into the egg and the yolk just oozed over the egg white and down the side of the English Muffin.  Pure poached egg bliss!  My compliments to the chef.  He really knows what he's doing.   My meal was delicious and the hash browns were exactly as ordered (extra crispy). My friend raved about her meal as well.  She loved the pancakes and her bacon looked like something out of a food magazine.  Oh, and the coffee?  Delicious!  Strong and smooth.  Order a cup.  It's magical. The food coupled with the service makes this a must go place for breakfast.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.

Just moved to Laveen.  Needed (ok, wanted) Chinese.  This place has great reviews so I drove there and got take out.  The beef and broccoli dinner came with rice, noodles, an eggroll, and two crab rangoons for around $9.  I found the beef and broccoli to be a little bit on the salty side but other than that everything was very good.  The lady at the counter was extremely friendly and was patient while I decided on what to eat.  They have a comfy little bar area where you can sit and wait for your food which was nice as well.  I'll be returning.

Came here yesterday because I was craving a burger. This is definitely a no frills type of place.  8 or so tables with order at the counter service (they'll bring your food to the table when it's ready). Settled on the Cali burger and a vanilla milkshake.  While I waited, I browsed what seemed to be an infinite number of bottled soda selections.  They were categorized by what appeared to be flavor so you can hone in on what you're in the mood for.  Both of the girls working the counter were extremely pleasant.  My food (to go) took about 7 minutes from the time I ordered it.  Total for the burger(single patty, no fries) and milkshake was about $9.50.  Got home and tore that burger apart.  Man, that was good.  I liked the Rocket Sauce that came on the burger.  Think a ketchup/mayo blend with a ton of pepper for kick.  I didn't even need to put ketchup on the burger.  The bacon was crisp (score!) and the avocado perfectly ripe. The buns they use are also on point.  Definitely more "sturdy" than a traditional bun (it reminded me of challah bread).   I saw a couple other burgers I'd like to try so I'll definitely come back and bring some friends along.

Went here last night and was impressed at the selection of sushi/sashimi/hand rolls/specialty rolls.  Tried a bunch but the highlight of the evening was the Hawaiian roll which was a deep fried coconut shrimp with banana, wrapped in traditional seaweed and rice, topped with mango. It was a like an instant trip to the islands and complimented the other rolls with it's "not too sweet" sweetness. Service was excellent and considering the place was pretty full, I felt like our sushi arrived quickly. They have 5 or 6 outside tables for when the weather is nice, so take advantage of that. Also, if you check in on Yelp*, you get an instant coupon worth 50% (yes 50%!) off almost every roll on the menu. Now that's a great deal!

Revolving sushi place?  Yes please!  I love coming here for the sheer novelty of it alone.  I was most recently here last Friday night and it was packed.  Where we were seated was towards the end of the conveyor belt cycle so a ton of the menu options were already scooped up by other patrons which was a little bit annoying, but this was the first time it was an issue.  The fix to that is to remember what you like and ask your server to go grab it for you (yes, they'll get you whatever you ask for).  I consider this place to be like a sushi treasure hunt.  You never know what's coming down the belt next. The sushi is far from the best I have ever had but it's quite good and there are plenty of different rolls to choose from.  The prices are also ridiculously reasonable.  Unlike a traditional restaurant, the plate you grab only has three or four pieces of sushi on it, but when you're only paying between $2-$4 for it and consider that you'd pay $12-$14 for a specialty roll at a traditional restaurant, this place is a steal.  I normally eat 5 plates worth of sushi (I always come starving), and my bill is never more than $25.  I'd spend that on two specialty rolls and a drink at a regular place.  The kids really seem to enjoy this place too.  It probably has more to do with watching the food on the belts, but don't shy away from bringing them here.  It's a fun, loud place perfect for kids. There is a menu you can order from with other options if you or your partner don't dig sushi.  I'd tell you more about it, but to be honest, I've never looked at it once.

Got my car washed here today.  Cool place.  Pulled up to the payment station and an employee told me he'd give  me a $4 discount off a $15 wash.  OK!  My car was clean when I exited, and I took advantage of the free vacuums available once your wash is complete.  There are no attendants to wipe the water off of your vehicle once through the wash, so this is not the place to go to if you're looking for full service. I will return for a quick run through whenever the car needs it, for sure.

Got there right when it opened with pre-purchased tickets and am so glad we did.  The line to purchase tickets was incredibly long and the people waiting seemed extremely frustrated.   Once inside, there was ONE location to purchase tokens (required for almost every food purchase available). Spent about 20 minutes just to get the tokens and then let loose inside of the festival.  There were a ton of choices and my friend and I sampled a bunch of tacos.  Blanco (Scottsdale) and Joy Ride (central PHX) were my two faves BY far.  Both trucks had employees with great personalities and the tacos they dished out were delicious.  One bad experience was attempting to buy a churro for dessert.  When asked how many tokens the churros were, the guy said "6". Each token is worth $2 meaning that the guy was charging $12 for a 10 inch churro.  I asked him (politely, of course) how he could possibly get away with charging such a ridiculous amount for a churro and he said that the festival takes 50% of the dollar amount of the tokens they receive and he needed to make a profit.  Still....$6 walk away for a churro.  Come on, dude.  Now you're just being ridiculous. Needless to say, we didn't buy any churros. By 2pm, we had seen everything there was to see and were stuffed.  As we headed back to the parking lot, I was amazed to see what appeared to be around a thousand people waiting to get into the festival and the line to get token for food was just ridiculous.  How can you not have a better system for getting people in the event and eating?   I dont know if I'll return next year.  For the aggravation and lack of organization, I'd rather skip it and try out other new events.

I have been to the Long Wong's in Central Phoenix (love it) so imagine my surprise when I saw one in my new town!  WOOOOOT!  Came here the day I moved into my house with my friend.  Immediately noticed that the prices for wings are about a dollar more per dozen then the Central PHX location but didn't mind.  We ordered, sat down, and in about 15 minutes had our food.  I was amazed to see that the size of the wings here was double the size of the other LW's.  So that's why they were a dollar more... As always, the wings were awesome.  I always ask for mine well done so they're crispy, but they're definitely not soggy if you forget to ask.  They have about 10 sauces you can choose from and also have dry rubs like lemon pepper and just salt and pepper if that's more your style.  All orders come with carrots and ranch (you may sub blue cheese for no extra charge).   I can't really comment on the service aspect of LW's since you order at the counter and they just bring you your food when it's ready, but the workers were pleasant and answered our questions happily.  This will definitely be a place I frequent now that I live in Laveen.

My friend and I came here before setting out in Westgate for the evening.  We were immediately seated and were served by a fantastic female who took awesome care of us all night.  We ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer and holy moley, they were enormous!  She and I could have happily shared this as our entree and called it good but we ordered BBQ as well.  We ate only half of the nachos before the biggest plates of food I've seen in a long time arrived at our table.  I had the pulled pork platter with cole slaw and mac and cheese and she had the rib tips with the same two sides.  It was absolutely delicious!  The only item I wasn't totally thrilled about was the mac n cheese, but that's only because I prefer Southern style mac (firm and can be cut into cake-like pieces).  Theirs is creamy.  It was good, but not my fave.  The cole slaw was awesome and the BBQ sauce that came with the pulled pork was sweet and smoky.  We were checked on by management twice while we ate and they were very kind and genuine.   ***TIP: If you check in, you get a free appetizer!  Our ridiculously huge and delicious nachos turned out to be free and we had no problem with redeeming the Yelp* coupon.   Service here is top notch.  The portions are ridiculous, and for the price you pay, I felt it was extremely reasonable.  Before we left, one of the managers gave us a couple of "two for one" drink coupons and invited us back later on in the evening.  He told us the restaurant became a bar/dance club in the evening and boy was he right.  This was the most packed bar in all of Westgate and we had an absolute blast!  We danced all night, met tons of really nice people, and definitely used those 2 for 1 coupons the manager gave us earlier.   My friend and I lived it here and we will definitely come back (for the food and the fun!).

Came to this little shop in Desert Ridge with a girlfriend yesterday.  Both of us had never tried macarons so we said "what the heck?"   The owner of the shop was there and she was DEFINITELY french.  Her accent was beautiful.  She took the time to give my friend a sample of the Nutella gelato the shop had (they have about 12 different flavors) and also patiently answered all of our questions regarding the French chocolates and macarons in the shop. Besides the gelato, the macarons and chocolates can be purchased in multiples at a small discounted price.  We each purchased 3 macarons...the purchase totaled approximately $7.85.  Expensive for 3 cookies but good lord they were delicious.  I had the Rose, coconut, and praline while my friend had a coconut, orange liquor, and a chocolate.  We both agreed unanimously that our favorite was the coconut.   For those who have never had a macaron, the cookie has the tiniest bit of a crisp crust on the top but underneath is a billowy, soft center with the most delicious filling.  You just have to try it.  Seriously.  Worth every penny (or dollar).

Just moved in July 2, 2015.  Relocated from the Baltimore/DC area and am thoroughly impressed.  I was able to complete all of the required paperwork and make all of my pre move in payments online prior to my arrival.   When I arrived, I signed two pieces of paperwork and was in my apartment (after a short tour, of course).  I got a really nice, unexpected goodie bag complete with a handwritten welcome note,  bottled water, a cool, Tervis-like cup, popcorn, and magnets. :) The grounds are gorgeous and the maintenance team takes great care to ensure that they stay that way.  I found a few things that needed repairs or attention during my move in inspection and had maintenance at my door the next morning (there was nothing requiring immediate attention).  Both gentlemen were extremely nice, personable, and got all of the things I listed taken care of quickly and without incident. The community is gated which is also a nice plus.  You will receive a key fob that grants you access through the vehicle and pedestrian gates, as well as the clubhouse, mail room, pool, and gym. Your guests can look you up at a call box located outside of the gate and the box calls your cell phone so you can grant them gate access.  Convenient!   Don't be put off by the complex's proximity to the 101. I live in a location in the complex very close to the highway and cannot hear a thing from inside my apartment.  The walkways, paths, and hallways to the apartments are all well lit and I have always felt safe while walking through the complex.  It is also very quiet.  No thumping music or people partying until dawn.  It's surprisingly quite serene! The mailboxes are located in the clubhouse and is accessible 24 hours a day as well as the gym and bathrooms.   The pool isn't huge, but is beautiful and has tons of loungers, cabanas, firepits, and misters.  They even have BBQ grills next to the pool and a large eating area (there are additional gas grills and seating set ups strewn throughout the complex too).  I am pretty sure the pool is 24 hours as well, but don't quote me on it. Keone and the rest of the Seven staff are amazing. I have been going through hell with the company I hired to move my stuff and am basically living with nothing but an air mattress and three changes of clothes.  I had to go into the office to sign another document and was explaining my situation to the staff.  They were ridiculously sympathetic and even offered to lend me pots, pans, and anything else I would need from their own homes.  Fortunately, I have some good friends here who are helping me out until my stuff gets here, but I thought I would add this into my review to show just how compassionate and kind the staff here are.   A few things you may wish to consider: 1) parking is limited. You are assigned one space under a covered awning. If you have more than one vehicle, the other must park in an uncovered, unassigned guest spot (which can sometimes be difficult to find, especially on weekends).  Unless you live on the third floor, your assigned spot will be nowhere near your apartment.  The majority of the covered parking is on the opposite side of the complex from where I live.  That means hauling groceries quite a distance and making multiple, long trips.   I asked to be moved to a closer spot, but was told that the developers of the complex made the parking plans based on the floor you live on, not the location of your building.  I bought a collapsible wagon and tote my purchases that way, but it really can be a pain.  If there was ANYTHING I would deduct a star for here, that would be it, but I'm not disabled in any way and am really just being fickle (apologies). No stars off because I am admittedly a tad bit lazy and not acclimated to the heat!  2) Don't park in an assigned spot if it's not yours.  Management does enforce towing.  3) There are no overhead lights in the bedrooms or living room, so bring lamps! (The kitchen, bathrooms, laundry room, and dining area are all equipped with overhead lights). 4) I can hear the person above me stomping around during the day and can also hear when the shower is on upstairs, but can't hear televisions or voices.  I lived in an atrociously old, loud building in MD prior to moving here, so I am not bothered by this at all, but for someone who isn't used to hearing noise from neighbors or that may be bothered by this, you'd probably want to know.  5) Every month, you receive a bill with your rent, water, trash, and pest control rolled into one bill (water is on an individual meter, not billed as a building share).  You can pay online with an e-check (free) or by credit card (I think it's a $5.00 convenience fee/charge).  Electricity is billed by APS and you are required to set that up and show proof to Seven prior to move in. Overall, I couldn't be happier living here and thank my lucky stars that I picked Seven Apartments as my first place in Phoenix.  I can see myself living here for a very long time.

Came here for their Grand Opening/Free Salad event earlier in the week.  I also attended their Yelp elite event a few days prior.  That's how much I liked this place.  Their juices are UNBELIEVABLE and the salads are delicious too.  Oh, and did I mention the tofu?  Probably some of the best I've ever had.  Pick a salad or make your own...everything is made to order and is super fresh.  Feel free to add or subtract ingredients or swap out the dressings/protein to suit your taste.   I also met one of the owners of the company (Marley) who is a really kind hearted, generous guy.  He loves his business and his employees and it shows.  The restaurant is immaculate and the employees are all really friendly.  They open at 7am so you can get your juice on for breakfast (Yum!).  Definitely give this place a try!

Disclaimer: this review is mostly about the event itself and NOT the food trucks/vendors. Holy Moses! Can you say unorganized? I know this was a first time event, but geez. Was invited as a Yelp Elite judge and no one (staff) knew where the meet up point was. Walked around aimlessly for about 40 minutes before someone I recognized told me where the group was. We were supposed to start at 12 noon and didn't get started until 12:40. We walked as a group back and forth to the ticket area twice to get tickets for the food. Were promised 5 drink coupons but only received one. None of the food vendors took drink coupons (which was not explained before hand) and the one location that did accept them sold out before we could even get over there. We were able to try SOME of the food. Many vendors said they were not providing samples because of the problems they had the day before and that they lost money on them. Others said they had no idea that there was an Elite judging event and simply denied food. Even more appalling, some of the vendors were downright rude. The staff member who briefed us about the judging (Aspen) even warned us that some of the vendors were "stressed out" and to "expect to get some attitude." Seriously????? Attitude???? Very frustrating for those of us who took the time to apply as judges and came out of our way to help with the event.  The sorbetto cart and Coyote's Oaties were the best the event had to offer. There was also a very good panini truck that I would recommend you try.  If you're in the mood for BBQ, you're in luck. I'd say over half of the vendors there were offering BBQ.  Whomever coordinated this event (at least with regard to the judging) needs a refresher course. This was an extremely poorly planned event with vendors who were very ill informed of what was supposed to be going on. I'll pass on coming back next year.

Just moved to Laveen from Moon Valley and needed to find a nail salon.  Came here and was pleasantly surprised- the interior of the salon is immaculate and the workers were friendly.  Unfortunately though, I received a HORRIBLE gel manicure from one of the female techs and won't be returning.  I asked to have my nails cut- they weren't.  The tech roughly buffed my nails and then with my own nail "dust" all over my hands and nails whips out the polish like she wants to start painting my nails.  I asked her, "shouldn't I wash my hands first?" She told me no.  I replied to her, " I'm going to get up and wash my hands" and I did.  At the sink I inspected my nails and they were jagged and crooked.  Upon my return to the tech's chair I politely asked her to continue buffing my nails and to fix all of the uneven tips/edges.  Surprisingly, she was totally cool with it and did as I asked.  I didn't get to wash my hands again though, so on went the nail polish with all of my nail dust all over my hands.  The tech did an awful job painting my nails.  Three days later and I still have gel polish on my cuticles and the sides of my nail beds.  What really made me upset though was that after I was done drying under the UV light, the tech started filing my nails again!  Um, shouldn't you have done that BEFORE you painted them?!?  Ugh. Two stars for the cleanliness and kindness of the techs...one star for the service provided.  My search for a decent nail salon in Laveen continues.
