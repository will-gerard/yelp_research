I honestly can't say I've been to a worse cycle store. I've dealt with this place in both parts and service and they get nothing right. I've ordered parts that, after explaining in detail what I need, had the wrong part ordered. "I know exactly what you're talking about." Famous last words. Common parts that they don't even stock.   I took my bike there to have a service done. The guy told me there would be a wait because they have so much work ahead of my bike. I'm patient, but after almost 2 weeks, right when I'm about to call, I get a LETTER IN THE MAIL saying they DON'T HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER to contact me. I called them and they not only had a number, but the RIGHT NUMBER. I had to wait for something in the mail when these guys had my number. The service guy said it was some woman's number. I called my number from work. It was the generic computer voice. Yes, a female computer voice.   When I called back a couple of days later, he said he'd been trying to call that number, but it still didn't work. Every phone I used reached my phone. Two days later, the one person in a motorcycle store who knows how to use a phone called me (same number) to tell me the bike is ready. This is THREE WEEKS LATER. To make up for it, they took a couple bucks off the bill.   Now I have a motorcycle that I'm going to have to piece together after having to take it apart and learn how to FIX WHAT THEY BROKE. Loose hoses, incomplete work, garage full of pulled apart  motorcycle pieces. It was an expensive lesson to learn, but I will NEVER set foot in this place again and will steer any friend I have away from this DUMP.

Ryno's is OK BBQ in a not too appealing environment. It's a real sloppy place, and even though it's new, should look more appealing than this. Storage stuff is in the open, all over the place, on cheap metal racks. They have picture-frames on the walls without photos in them, besides the ones that come in the frame when you buy it.   The food isn't anything that stands out. The brisket was OK, but nothing I couldn't do as good, or better, in my oven. The potato salad tastes just like Wal-Mart stuff. Literally. Ryno's either buys their stuff, or they have the recipe for cheap potato salad. The beans are chili beans that are store-bought chili beans with pork thrown in them. Ryno's offers one other side, no fries or macaroni and cheese, and one desert, a brownie.   The first time I went there (later in the day) they were closed because they ran out of meat. There's a Famous Dave's down the street. Even that's better than Ryno's.

Anyone who likes Can't Stop Smokin' doesn't know BBQ. These people are a chain style BBQ joint that is meant to cater to people just wanting to eat out, not anyone looking for good Q.   The brisket only has flavor on one edge. They don't prep it so the flavor goes throughout the meat and it sits there precut so it can dry out while it's waiting on you to order it. That's a basic failure in serving this type of food. The sausage is store bought and sits around in a stack waiting for you to order it.   The sides are basic. Dried corn on the cob, macaroni and cheese with processed cheese (think Kraft with premade "cheese" in the box with an aftertaste) and the baked beans taste like canned beans with pepper added. The cornbread is God-awful. It's almost as dense as iron and has a really bad taste.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Even the Arizona Dickie's style BBQ joint is better than this. That, and there is a Ruby's literally just across the street. It's good, and head and shoulders better than this place that won't last long against its neighbor.

OK. Now I can only rate Joe's for their breakfast, but, as everyone else has said, it's not what you'd call "airport food." Joe's breakfast was excellent. I mixed it with a lunch item, beans, and wow! Best beans I've had in a while. And I'm a BBQ fanatic. Shockingly enough the service was great as well. Having been in numerous airports around the world, I have seen an incredibly small number of airport restaurants who provide service with a smile along with outstanding food. We only went to the airport for business, but next time we go through Sky Harbor in Phoenix during our travels, we're trying lunch or dinner.
