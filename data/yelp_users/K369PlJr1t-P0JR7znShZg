My family and I love Red Lobster, We go on date nights here about once a month.  Always ask for Sara she is the Best Waitress and always remembers what we had the last time we where in.  She is So Awesome!

Just had the Bangers and Mash with the Red Wine Gravy... Totally awesome I usually get the Lamb & mint. But wanted to try something different.  What a great Pasty will definitely get again.  This is such a great place, you definitely need to take a trip especially if you have never tried A pasty before.  Also Great Beer Selection.

Ok so I take my wife here because of the reviews.  First I have to say the area is not that great. Second there are people smoking right by the front door on the patio. Now these things dont really bother me to find a really good food spot but this is not it. What it really is, is a bar with food expensive food that tastes like its from The can not fresh.  I did get a free potato skin appetizer for checking in on yelp. But they were not that great. I really wanted this place to be great I ordered the beef wellington med. rare but it was well done and and the gravy and mushrooms were from a can and it taste just like liver. Wow it was gross.  My wife had the same problem but her meat was at least better than mine.  The Salad bar looked like my middle childs salad bar...Terrible,  that should have been our sign to get out but we didn't.   Though I would say the service is nice. But unfortunately We will not be coming here again.  $90 later! Man i was really wanting a Beef Wellington.  Well looks like i will have to try some place else. Update...20 minutes later I threw up. Man I feel like I have been Gipped!

Ok I love Costco, Not really for the food, but just to go.  Totally a fun place to people watch as well if you are into that sort of thing.  You can also go there to get free snacks, Try smoothies, buy a hot dog and a soda for Cheap.  Ok Ok Its just Costco but when you have a big family its fun!

Great Team of Mechanics, Ben is always welcoming and very honest.  They do a great job!  If you need a mechanic and don't want to spend allot of money he is the one to go see.
