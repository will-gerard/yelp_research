Thanks for a very fun holiday lights tour! We were a group of 57 made up of half kids and half adults. The kids were all about 2-5 years old and they loved the big red bus as well as riding high up.  The hot chocolate was great for a very chilly night.  We were not boozing and pub crawling, but some of the parents enjoyed having beer or wine that they brought on the bus. A great way for parents to take their kids out to see the holiday lights.  Maybe we'll have to turn this into an annual event?

The political agenda of this show overpowers every part of the show. I was not expecting that. The dance was basic traditional dance. Well done but nothing out of the ordinary.  We left before the show was over. Each piece was like the one before after coming back from  intermission.
