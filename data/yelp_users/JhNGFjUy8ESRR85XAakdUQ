What a great "cash only" retro place. I ordered the cheese steak with everything and it was fabulous. I also sampled the Italian beef which was also very tasty. This is an old fashion Mom & Pop place with real character. The soda comes in cans and did I mention that it is cash only? Well, it is so leave your plastic at home.

I love this place. It is "American" French food establishment. Translation, non pretentious french dining at a reasonable price. I have tried most everything on the menu over the years and have yet to be disappointed. The crab omelette and the steak frite are my two favorites. Their onion soup is wonderful and pretty darn big.

I stopped in here for lunch today planning on having a slice of pie and a coffee. After seeing the food coming out of the kitchen I decided to be sensible and try their bourbon burger and onion rings and pie for desert. Well like all good plans that didn't work. The  burger was amazing and huge. A hot juicey burger served with bacon, grilled onions and a slice of Swiss cheese. It was a full meal. The onion rings were also delicious and plentiful.  Needless to say there was no room for pie. Next time I'll stick to the original plan of pie and coffee. I do have to mention that the wait staff was beyond awesome. The water glass never went dry and they were uber friendly! I look forward to my next trip up north.

We have taken our shelter acquired kitty here since day one. Dr Izumi has always given her outstanding care and has shown a genuine concern for her health. We elected to not declaw her and their staff taught us the correct way to trim her claws and when she got sick they got us a same day appointment.  The medical services here are actually superior to the medical services we receive down the street at our family doctor. If you are looking for a great vet, you are going to like this place.

I'm all about the mom and pop places and that is exactly what China Wok is. Family ran and very friendly. I ordered a small (plenty big) beef chow fun and my daughter ordered the orange chicken lunch. The chow fun was exactly like what you get in Hong Kong. It was served piping hot with plenty of meat and veggies and just the right amount of sauce. Not to saucy and not to dry. My daughters serving of orange chicken was massive. Lots of crispy chicken again with the right amount of sauce. It came with two generous scoops of rice and a few fried wonton.

I'm in the middle of restoring a classic auto and wanted to change the kph speedometer to a mph unit. I bought a new speedo online and took it to Dicks to get the odometer set to match the speedo that I was removing. I dropped it off at 11:00 and was told to come back in 90 minutes. I ran a few errands, grabbed a quick lunch and returned 90 minutes later. It was done right and ready to go.  Thanks all!!!

Hands down the best gelato in the valley. I have eaten here hundreds of times and have never been disappointed. Their gelato is always fresh and the family that owns it is always there. My favorite is the panna cotta. I could eat it till I explode! They also offer spectacular coffee/espresso and sandwiches. The place is amazing, it's like somebody brought Italy to you.

I love this place. I could drink their enchilada sauce as a hot beverage. Their cheese enchiladas are my absolute favorite enchiladas in the entire world. I also enjoy their beef tacos with rice and beans. Priced nicely, served hot and all the soda a human can consume. They do get jam packed at lunch time but offering good food will do that. I always get a dozen tortillas to go which I believe they make themselves.  My one complaint is I hate eating off of styrofoam and everything is served that way. If you ask they will give you paper plates to transfer you meal onto.

We eat here a lot over the years and the food is usually great. Today my lunch came out cold. The waiter took it back to the kitchen and brought it back steaming hot about a minute later. Is that good? Yes and no. It was supposed to be hot in the first place AND it was reheated in a microwave oven instead of remaking it. I did't pay for a microwave meal, I paid for a freshly made lunch. Additionally microwave ovens don't belong in any restaurant kitchen. Please throw your microwave oven away or lock it up so your chef can't use it during business hours. It promotes mediocrity and laziness on the kitchens part. I'll be back and hopefully the quality that I have come to expect will be back too. ;-)

We went back for dinner last night and all was good. Shrimp fajitas came out piping hot. Chicken fajitas, hot and plentiful. My enchiladas, hot and super flavorful. The whereabouts of the microwave? Unknown but it wasn't used on anything we ordered.

I usually fix my own cars but when I get lazy or need a lift I use Combs. Eric and Leo are amazing knowledgeable and are honest as the day is long. They perform quality work at a very fair price.  A few years back I needed a new starter on a Landcruiser. A PITA to do myself. Combs was more than $100 cheaper than the local Toyota dealer and they used the same exact parts. Today I needed brake drums turned which they did in an hours time and they were half the price of the other shop that I called. Thanks guys!

I'm very sad to see this place go. Good luck with your ASU location.

What a giant waste of time. I upgraded three phones with the option to send my old phones back to Verizon for a credit. They were sent back and confirmation from USPS was received that they were delivered. Wireless Advocates somehow entered the wrong phone serial numbers for the wrong phone numbers prompting me to spend an hour plus undoing the mess so as to not have to pay a few hundred $$ for each phone upgrade. Things are still unresolved but lesson learned. Costco is good for 5 gallons of mustard or 20 pounds of hamburgers but STAY AWAY FROM THE PHONE KIOSK!  As a side not I tried calling the kiosk several times for help but nobody ever answers the phone. How is that for irony? They sell phones but don't answer them.

It just keeps getting worse. After spending hours undoing what they did to my phone account I find out that the manager quit and so did her boss. It's like rats fleeing a sinking ship. I talked to the Costco manager and he said that the Wireless Advocate kiosk is a constant source of problems for him.

Another happy Yelper! I rolled in with my antique Landy looking for a quality tint job. Before saying he could Rick suggested I fix a few pieces of window trim as to have a first class finish. I did so and was he right. A fabulous job at a very fair price. The shop is very busy (because of the high quality of work) so make an appointment. I dropped the truck off when they opened and it was done before 2p the same day.

How do you stay in business? Packages out for delivery for 2 days and somebody delivering packages at midnight in a broken down van that belongs down by the river. You fail Amazon and all of its customers.

I love this store! They are always very helpful and friendly. I have bought several sets of tires from them with ZERO issues. I make an appointment, show up on time and am out the door shortly there after. As for knowledge, they have it. Special orders, never a problem. Today I bought in an 25+ year old Land Rover that needed special order tires. They took my order Wednesday over the phone and called Friday that they had arrived. Saturday at 10:30 I showed up and at 11:15 I was on the road. Thanks!!!!

This is our goto, where should we get take out for dinner place. We ave had EVERYTHING on their menu and we have never been disappointed. The gyros and the falafel are both wonderful along with their tasty Greek salad is a sure hit. I should also mention that in the hundreds of times we have taken out food there has NEVER been an error on the order.

New name but the same wonderful food.  I ordered a trio of pork tacos that were absolutely amazing. I do have to say that the cochinita pibil taco was my favorite. I added their avocado salsa that was marked medium heat and it was hot.  My daughter ordered the fish tacos. It was a big order and it included rice. She absolutely devoured them and said that they were the best tacos she had ever tried.  Next time I'll try a few of the beef tacos or perhaps the fish tacos.

We gave them another try this week. The same waiter that we had the first time waited on us again so the bar was unmoved. This visit he was very attentive and courteous.  We ordered a Spiga salad split, prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloin and seafood risotto. The salad was fresh and the split still gave us two good sized portions. It was a good choice.  The prosciutto wrapped tenderloin was a tasty, massive portion served with mashed potatoes and veggies. It was in one word...... Wonderful. The seafood risotto was a good sized portion of tender rice served with plenty of clams, mussels, shrimp, squid and one scallop and a baby octopus. I will definitely order this dish again.  All and all I'm glad we came back for a second try and I'm even happier that our first poor experience was an isolated incident.

Great breakfasts served by a super friendly staff. My daughter and I both ordered egg dishes which were fabulous. The super friendly waitress was so pumped up on their pancakes of the day she brought us out one to try. A bit to sweet for my tasting but she gets an A++ for her enthusiasm and salesmanship. I look forward to my next visit.

New place in my neighborhood and I'm liking what I'm seeing. Great coffee priced better than any place in the area including THAT coffee giant chain. I enjoyed a tasty flat white and look forward to trying an iced cold brew next visit.

Stopped in for lunch and what a surprise.I tried the Notorious B.I.G. Burger and it sure lived up to its name. 7" tall and stuffed with a burger, cheese, shredded pork, slaw and pork rinds on a bun.  I had no idea how to tackle this so I pulled off the pork rinds and ate them as a side along with the fresh cut fries. The sandwich was an amazing mess and well worth the deconstruction and the required multiple napkins. For the fries they offered regular and curry catsup. The curry catsup was yummy, give it a try. If you are going to eat here and you are not 20 years old be ready for the background music.......Rap with a modern twist. That too surprised me but then again the side of the building is "tagged" with a Ghetto Boyz quote so I should have guessed that.
