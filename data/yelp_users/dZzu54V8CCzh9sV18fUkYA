I protested going to this place.  The thought of a restaurant with only three sandwich choices and no substitutions; to a picky eater this is a recipe for disaster.   However, when a colleague offered to take me there for my birthday I decided to give it a try and all I have to say is WOW!  I had the tomato mozzarella sandwich and until that exact moment I did not like mozzarella cheese.  The combination of ripe tomatoes, cheese and basil was like heaven in my mouth.  The bread was a perfect combination of crisp but not hard to bit into.  I also loved the different drink options besides soda.   It loses a star for seating issues, the place was packed and seating is at picnic tables outside only.  We had to wait for a place to squeeze in between two parties on a picnic table.  I guess that's the price you pay for reasonably priced, fresh, delicious food.  Next time, I'll take it back to my office.

WOW!  Their Thai Basil Margarita is the best, so good I had to have three!  I liked this place prior to the Elite Yelp party last night and now I LOVE this place!  I had the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and each one was out of the spectrum of my "normal" for what I would order and each dish blew me away with its combination of unique, fresh, tasty  ingredients.  I loved the sushi with the strawberry's on top as well as the Tom Yum soup!  The thing was so huge I ate it for dinner last night and lunch and dinner again today.  I am normally partial to Malee's on Main rather then Desert Ridge ( I like the vibe better there) but after last night I may be converted.  The staff was great, the order came out perfect (and I always special order like ten different things) and they were very accommodating to our large party.  I can't wait to go back!

Family owned....check Taking care of the regulars...check  Strong drinks.....check  Fresh foods...check  Great service...check  Sports on TV...check Inexpensive...check  Free drinks...we got em!   So I drive by this place all the time but never stopped in until yesterday. My co-workers, who are regulars here, made me go and now I know why they are regulars.  The staff was a blast and put up with our big, loud party and excessive use of our table....what started as lunch turned into a ten hour event.  They took care of us like how you would care for your family (thanks Freddie)!  What an awesome locally owned, customer friendly restaurant with a laid back atmosphere and great food & drinks!

This place was so disappointing!  Everyone I know had such wonderful things to say about this place but my experience there was nothing short of disappointing.  We got there and from the front it looks like this cute, charming farm house but step inside and behind the wall where the three outside tables are and you have a huge room that lacks any luster.  Where to start on what went wrong...the server had zero personality and verged on rude, the salad was inedible (how can a salad be inedible?), entries took forever to come out and when they did there was nothing to it.  I ordered a baked chicken dish that was so not impressive.  Our side order of greens was overcooked and saturated in oil. And they only serve coffee by the pot not by the glass... who does that?   And to add insult to injury we had an enormous bill!  The upside... The bread was good.  Maybe they were having an off night or training a new chief but I would be reluctant to go back to this restaurant.

Kashman's has the best matzoh ball soup in town... go for that alone.  I also like their salads and sandwiches - standard deli fare but it's all great quality and big portions. I love this place, and as a matter of fact, so does my dad!  He is more of a regular at this Kashman's than me... he goes for breakfast at least 5 days a week.  Enough said!

If you find yourself downtown and in the mood for Thai this place is great.  Small and cozy (although not much ambiance) it offers friendly service, good food and relatively cheap prices.  It is walking distance from downtown hotels, on the dash line and if you ever work on the weekends like I do, one of the few places that is open Sunday night for dinner.   Plus, its super friendly to solo dinners with its single TV that seems to always have on a romantic comedy to giggle at while dinning alone.

What a great addition to Phoenix.  If you want a dinning experience, not just a meal, this is your place.  The ambiance was welcoming and cozy.  The space is small, in that kind of New York City, cool way.  We had a reservation for 8:00 and the seated us right on time.  From the start they let us know the table was ours for the night so sit back, relax and take your time.  The staff wanted us to have a dinning experience and that was clear.  Our waiter was exceptionally knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients, including the wine.   The chief personally stopped by our table to make sure we enjoyed our food!  The food was delicious!  Let me say that again and stress that ... THE FOOD WAS DELICOUS!!  We had a big party so I was able to try many of the menu items.  There was not one bit of anything I put in my mouth that night that I did not like.  My favorite appetizer was the roasted chestnut soup and for the main dish, the best at the table was the beef short ribs.  Oh and don't forget to save room for desert!  The coffee gets its own special mention.  They serve it in the press at the table!  It was awesome!  They also serve cotton candy to the table, which I found to be a fun and different touch!  I gave it four stars instead of five stars for the single reason of cost (based on food/serv ice I would have given it 5 stars).  I ordered a special that was $50 and the smallest portion size I had ever seen!  In all fairness to Noca, I did not leave hungry, or stuffed, rather "just right" but I did think for $25+ for main entrees the portion sizes could use an extra scoop!

Man you people were hard on this review.  While I agree it does not  have 5 star credentials lets look at it for what it really is.  For a neighborhood that is not overflowing with choices, it serves it's purpose.  Lets be honest there are not a lot of options in the area of  17Th Ave and Van Buren for coffee shops let alone cool coffee shops.  If you happen to work or play in this area and need a decent cup of coffee that's not served by corporate America this is the place.  Additionally, this place has vegetarian and vegan choices for lunch at a reasonable price.

I never write reviews but this place was awesome so I had too! I had a few hours to kill in between meetings downtown so I checked Yelp for a place to grab a coffee and something to eat. This place had all five stars and I now get why! The food and coffee was fantastic but the staff really made it a five. TJ took my order and introduced himself and the place. They gave me free coffee for being a newbie and everyone new everyone in the place by name. It almost took me off guard how kind everyone was as you just don't see friendliness like this in most establishments! Place had an art gallery and plant store attached too!
