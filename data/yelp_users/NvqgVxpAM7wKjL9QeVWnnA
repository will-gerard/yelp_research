I was very nervous about going to my appoinment- I'm new to therapy. I had an evening appointment and the front office was closed when I got there, so I started filling out my new patient paperwork just as a sign had instructed. There was a bell to ring for service but no one came when I rang it (three times over 40 minutes). As people (I assume they were other therapists) came out of offices, no one acknowledged me or returned my smile. I finally got someone to take my paperwork and continued to wait.   I got into my appointment about 15 minutes late. That happens and I don't fault anyone for that, but my appointment was also cut short. My therapist was disinterested in the entire shortened session. I was dressed pretty nicely but had exposed tattoos that seemed to bother her. She stared and seemed distracted, making me feel the need to explain to her that I was a good person more than once. Mind you, I was there for self esteem and anxiety issues, so feeling judged by an apathetic therapist was pretty unsettling. She didn't smile, she wasn't warm, and she wasn't encouraging.  After I left, I jokingly told someone that the therapy session helped in its own way because the woman I saw was so curt and unpleasant that it made me feel like a better person.

Thank you, Yelp! If it wasn't for you, I never would have found this place that is 2 minutes from my apartment. I had never had kosher pizza before today and this is a great NY style pie. Having lived in Chicago, I'm usually partial to a heavy, thick pizza but King Solomon's found its way into my heart at first bite.  The restaurant itself isn't the most fancy place, but it has plenty of seating for customers dining in. Also, it's tucked back in a tiny plaza just south of Camelback Road so you have to keep your eyes peeled.  The staff was friendly and asked me how I preferred my pizza (crispy or otherwise). When I got home and opened the box, I wasn't blown away by the pizzas appearance. And then I tasted it... everything about it was delicious. I got a 14" with mushrooms, garlic, and black olives. They didn't go heavy on the toppings, which I prefer. There was a great balance between the sauce, cheese, and crust. My favorite part is the sweet, buttery trace that I can't quite put my finger on.  I'm from the midwest. I'm picky about pizza. King Solomon's for the win.

I've been here a few times while bar hopping with the Rage Cycles folk. We tend to be dressed ridiculously but there are all kinds at ZuZu. It has the kind of atmosphere where you can get dressed up just because or walk in casually. The bar always has a delicious drink specials and the prices are comparable to other places around town. ZuZu is actually inexpensive compared to other "fancy" looking restaurants/bars.   In all honesty, I have never eaten here but I've nibbled off of peoples' plates and the food is great if you're looking for bar food with a little flare.   ZuZu is a great spot to meet a small group or date. Highly recommended! And it's close to old town, which makes it easy to hop around to other desirable spots.

I go to Pro's Ranch Market often for lunch- sometimes several times a week. I've had the street tacos, chile relleno, burritos, and some other tasty treats. I'm a huge fan of the agua fresca stand- my favorites are the strawberry, pineapple, and horchata. And the bakery... oh, the bakery. They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake.   The store itself has the cheapest produce in town, a giant meat counter, and a great assortment of cheeses. Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas. This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm on my way to a BBQ or party- there are so many options!

Oh man... I swear they sprinkle magic on their sandwiches. That's the only explanation I have for for craving Cheba Hut at least once a day. I've tried a handful of items and they're all delicious and unique. My favorite is the Griefo with bacon- yes a veggie sandwich WITH bacon. The hemp cream cheese is super duper!   The staff is friendly and they don't speed through the orders even when there is a line and I mean that as a compliment. There's nothing worse than getting food home to find that it was thrown together in a hurry. I want to taste that love! Cheba Hut puts it in there.   The decor is a bit over-the-top hippie tacky but it's a small price to pay for kool-aid and tang on tap. YUM.

Oh, this place. I am about to leave my current job downtown and sure I'll miss keyboard guy at the corner of Central and Adams, but I'll miss One Coffee most of all.   The chai mix they use is EASILY the best I've ever tasted. If I promise not to sell it out of the lobby of my new job, I wonder if they'll tell me who makes it. Other than baby animals and a good burger, nothing makes me this happy. Try an iced chai with a bit of almond flavoring- you're welcome.  Their pies, breads, muffins, and other treats are all made in house and they are fantastic. Even their jam is homemade and it is so rich in flavor- the perfect topping on one of their giant bagels.   I'll miss you, One Coffee. I'll do my best to visit on weekends.

Two very big issues with this place:  1: The window actually says "Puppy Sales" on the window. Puppy sales.  2: The business is located right near a kwik-e-mart and a Bar/music venue. They have animals stacked in crates right by the windows (not sure if these are owned dogs that are boarded or if that is the "puppy sales department"). I'm not sure how big the place is inside, but they could easily figure out a floor plan where the dogs could be kenneled where they can actually sleep. Being kenneled in a strange environment is hard enough, but Puppy Land has them kenneled where they are subject to patrons of the plaza hitting the windows and barking at them. Even the passers-by that weren't being obnoxious didn't see the problem with tapping on the window, talking to them, or using body language the dogs might see as "challenging." There is also light from the plaza that comes in that window, even at night. Other areas of the facility were much darker from what I could tell.  Bottom line: If you are going to open a business that caters to pet care, make sure you are taking care of the pets. They are not products. They are not dollar signs. They are living things that need all of the advocates they can find. And the dogs in this establishment deserve some alone time at night- living in a kennel is stressful enough. They don't need us humans having easy access to bother them.
