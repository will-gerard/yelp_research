The bellyfiller is my go to choice, but you honestly can't go wrong with anything here! The only con is sometimes they run out of their bread, so make sure to come in early or call your order in ahead of time

If I could give zero stars I would. After reading the reviews and calling another Filipino restaurant closer to our home my family was sold on getting a whole lechon from here for my daughters first bday. From the moment we put in the order it was not a pleasant experience. We were told that they could deliver to a park in chandler were the party was being held, then minutes later they changed their mind and told us they wouldn't deliver it. On the day of the party we had set up the lechon and it was just not at all what we had expected. The skin was not crispy at all as it should've been traditionally. It was just soggy I guess is the best way to describe it. Having hyped it up to guests that they would be having a traditional Filipino dish that was crispy and succulent, it was embarrassing! My mom called the restaurant that day to complain and the wife of the owner told my mom that he would call her back, of course they didn't. So my mom called back today and spoke to Brandon, I think was his name. He said that they couldn't guarantee that the lechon would be crispy, which I think is ridiculous! If you as the customer are going to spend $320 for a dish that is traditionally crispy, then that is what you should get. Brandon also stated that he had seen that it was soggy when preparing it and that out of the three lechons they had prepared that day ours was the only non crispy one, so why did we get so lucky to receive that one. Hmm. He did offer to give half off the next lechon purchase, but why would we want that when this experience was none to pleasing, and anyways it was for a party it's not like we would want to eat a whole lechon on some random day.

Tried out garlic parm wings, mild wings, fries, and the biscuits for our first time here. The wings and fries were really good, but the biscuits are what we will definitely be returning for, they were so delicious! Deep fried ooey gooey goodness that's for sure!!

Pad Thai is delish! Also recommend the yellow curry and chicken fried rice and everything else lol you honestly can't go wrong with your choice here everything is so good! I love that they give complimentary soup to start with and coconut ice cream at the end that's fresh made in house! The customer service is always on point
