I got my car "detailed" and I'm very disappointed. I can hardly see out of my front windshield -- it looks like they waxed the window. I had my seats cleaned since a smoothie spilled and there's still large amounts of smoothie on the seat. I feel like I wasted $65 on nothing.

I signed up for the free mini session when my baby was 5 months old.... now my son is 2 years old and he continues to love it. Kindermusik has been an incredible learning experience for me and my child. Miss Brenlie is the most amazing educator who is truly passionate about her job. Not only is the class enjoyable and stimulating but she provides you with tools to continue teaching your child at home. I recommend Kindermusik to everyone!!
