For me it was bad, lobster was dry and tough. There is no happy hour. Just very disappointed

The food taste like Mexico. Favorites are the Chili Relleno plate and the shrimp plate

The people are nice, the food is good. The calamari appetizer is great, the gyro is good, the shrimp is good. Some of the reviews are just not so...
