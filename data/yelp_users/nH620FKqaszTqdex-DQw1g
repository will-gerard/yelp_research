This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix right now.  I've been here 5 or so times, and every time I am impressed by the service, food, and ambiance.  Walking in to the restaurant, you are greeted by the entire kitchen staff shouting something in japanese - it's fun and welcoming! The environment is very classy, but people can be wearing casual to dressy attire.  There are a variety of seating options, from regular tables, to booths, to sofa chairs, to benches.  A few patio seats as well.  Now on to the highlight - the food!  Disclaimer- I am not a huge sushi fan, though I will eat and enjoy it occasionally, but Yasu's has so much beyond sushi and it is all amazing! I usually order off of the tapas menu.  The pork belly bun is my absolute favorite, incredibly delicious.  The house green beans have a sauce that is so delicious I could order two of those generous servings and have that be my whole meal (if it weren't for the fact that I'd be missing out on all the other amazing options!).  My new favorite are the bacon wrapped dates - the perfect mixture of sweet and savory.  The asparagus with egg was good too.  I've tried probably 5 or 6 other menu items as well, and it's all on the range of good to great to absolutely amazing. I am so happy to have found such amazing Japanese food here in Phoenix!

This is the closest Einstein's to my apartment, and I love bagels, so I've come here pretty regularly for the past couple of years.  The staff is generally pretty nice and friendly, though I've had a couple of bad experiences.  They run out of the popular types of bagels by early afternoon, even earlier on the weekends, so I often have to go with a second or third choice.  However, the reason that I'm giving them 2 stars is that I have come to expect them to get my order wrong more often than not.  I always take out, so in the early days of coming here before I learned to check my bag, I ended up at home with bagels with the wrong cream cheese, wrong types of bagel, a toasted bagel with no topping when I had paid for butter, etc.  Just this morning, I was given a bagel with plain cream cheese when I had ordered honey almond.  At this point, though, I always check my bagels before I leave to get anything straightened out.  I gave them back the bagel and asked politely for one with honey almond cream cheese like I had ordered, and they made a new one - but did not apologize or give any indication that they cared that they had messed up, which is pretty typical.  I still come because I love Einstein's in general and this is by far the most convenient, but it is never a great experience.

I love the place - it's a very different experience from shopping at some of the other chain furniture stores nearby.  It feels like a family-owned store and they definitely treat their customers accordingly.  I bought a bedroom set from here about a year ago.  I got a great deal and it is really good quality furniture - it still looks brand new all this time later (even after a move). I requested a different mirror for the dresser and they were very accommodating, letting me choose from another set to mix and match to what I was looking for exactly.  They offered free delivery and the whole delivery process went very smoothly.  I highly recommend supporting a local business and shopping here!

I've learned with this Starbucks that it's all in the timing.  Coming here in the morning is an absolute madhouse.  Last Friday morning around 7:45am I saw the drive through line wrapping around the entire parking lot, so I walked in to order to try to save time.  It was standing room only and total chaos!  It took almost 20 minutes to get my coffee, but the staff was clearly working their butts off to get everything done as quickly as possible - it was just so crowded!  However, in the afternoons or on other non-busy hours, this Starbucks location is great.  The drive through is convenient and, while never particularly fast, can usually be pretty efficient.  Walking in, there are usually seats available.  All in all, I would recommend avoiding it during rush hour because they are so high volume and it can get crazy, but any other time it's a great location!

I got my car detailed here yesterday - despite the negative reviews, I had come in the distant past for basic washes and had been happy enough, so I decided to give it a try.  The detail cost $120 - very expensive, but my car is 8 years old and has never had the interior detailed so I decided it was worth it if it would really make it 'like new' as the salesperson promised.  I pointed to a few specific places I wanted to make sure could be cleaned, like the steering wheel and door handle that had accumulated some dirt, and was promised it would all come off. I dropped my car off and was told to return in an hour.  An hour later, I stopped by and saw my car sitting in the detailing area.  I walked over only to be told that they hadn't even started!  I was told another hour.  I left and ran a few errands, calling back 2 hours later to see what the progress was (as they told me they'd call when it was done).  I was told another half an hour.  I went in half an hour to find them still working on it, tree sap still stuck to the outside, which I was told I would need to pay more to remove.  The inside had 'new car' scent, even though I clarified twice I wanted vanilla, but that was the least of the issues.  The steering wheel and console had not even been wiped down! For $120 'detail' they sure overlooked a lot.  All the grime came off easily with a quick wipe of the rag, showing that they hadn't even bothered cleaning it at all.  Today, I opened up the cup holder to find that the foam cushion is gone except for the very center that is glued down - I guess they ripped it off while cleaning and got rid of the evidence, as it is nowhere to be found in my car.  I'm worried to find out what other things were forgotten or broken over the next few days... After $120 (plus tip) and a 3.5 hour wait I expected a lot more.  The only positive things I have to say were that the floors are very clean now and the guy who did the final checkout (not the one who was actually did the detailing and overlooked so much) was very nice.  I will definitely not be coming back.
