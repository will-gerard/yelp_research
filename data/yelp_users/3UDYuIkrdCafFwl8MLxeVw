Wow, what a cool place! I went for the first time last night and had the farmer sandwich, it was fabulous. Service was great. Love the atmosphere and vibe here. The patio is especially nice when the weather is right. The menu is just salads, sandwiches and pizzas but if that's what you're looking for, give it a try.  I highly recommend Liberty Market.

This place has been one of my perennial favorites for over 10 years. I love the subs, eggplant parm and greek vegetarian and two faves. The platters are great too. Tons of great deli salads and all the best ingredients an Italian grocer should have.

Excellent service and a cute little place in historic Glendale. Beautiful little tree-lined street and a lively patio. I had the tomato mozarella sandwich and tomato noodle soup. Both were very good. I'll be back for lunch.

I've been going to Pizzeria Bianco since 1995, when I first moved to Arizona and I can say without a doubt, this is the best damn pizza I have ever had. In fact, I'd go so far as to say Bianco is my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix.  Chris uses only the best ingredients and he makes the pizza himself. He is unwilling to grow the business and add more people because he knows the food will suffer. He's made a choice to do things his way and I applaud him for it.  My favorite pizza is the Bianco Verde but I also love the Rosa and the Margarita. The antipasto is always amazing and the salads are perfection. I do miss the old days when I only had to wait 1.5 hours but I still say it's worth every minute.

If you are not familiar with a pasty, it's a savory pocket pie that was originally made to be a portable meal for miners in England. Cornish Pasty Co is one of my favorite haunts. It's hot pockets for foodies. Great food, prepared with fresh ingredients. Everything is made from scratch, from the delicate crust to the savory fillings. They have a huge selection of different fillings (about 35), including a big selection of vegetarian selections. One of my favorites is the Veggie Rosemary Chicken (or non veggie version too). The sides (oven roasted potatoes) and salads are great too. They're open late, so I often stop here after a band gig when I'm starving and sit at the long bar. Service is usually very good.

Dozo is a great little neighborhood Sushi Place. The food, sushi and cooked are wonderful and staff make you feel at home. The Crazy Roll was one of my favorites. I highly recommend Dozo if you are in South Scottsdale.

I went for lunch today for the first time. The food was exemplary. The decor is really cool too, swanky but organic. The service was very good. Lots of brick, steel and iron. I had the executive special lunch, which consisted of a citrus salad with dates and goat cheese, a vegetable risotto with spinach, cauliflower and creme fraiche and a bag of five (actually seven) cookies. The citrus salad was fresh and light, just what you'd want. The risotto was creamy and rich. The cookies were unbelievable. Three chocolate chip and two peanut butter sandwiches with peanut butter cream. All homemade, all delicious. I will be going back.

A friend turned me on to juju berri and I'm hooked! The yogurt is yummy, especially the regular and green tea flavors. The toppings are awesome, lots of fresh fruit and decadent candy goodness too. I've tried some of the other yogurt places in town but none I have tried compare to juju berri.

I invited a group here to thank them for being such great clients. We had a really lovely lunch. It was a beautiful day and we sat on the back patio. Good atmosphere, inside and out. We started with the tableside guacamole, which was excellent. It had a little bite, just enough. I had the mahi mahi tacos and one of my guests did too, we both loved them. Two of the other guys had the chicken arepas with white and sweet potato fries that I had to sample. Service was very good. I would definitely recommend it and I will be back for dinner soon.

Walk, bike, light rail or drive, but get to Postino Central.  Postino Central is a definite favorite of mine, especially for late afternoon/happy hour food and drinks. It's tough to beat. The indoor/outdoor bar is fab. Service is always great and food is always better. The bruschetta, the hoegarden, the paninis, the hoegarden.  And don't forget the brunch, it's amazing. The scones, the egg sandwich, the french toast are all amazing.  Brian DeMarco's Trio plays here on Sunday afternoons too.  if you are looking for a great place to hang out, people watch and enjoy amazing food and drinks, this is the one.

I love this place. The tacos are spectacular, especially the vegetable tacos. The guacamole is unrivaled (sorry Barrio, yours is great, Gallo's is better). They have real masa chips, not cheap tortilla chips. The place is also beautiful, great views of downtown and it's nestled by the lobby of the hip Clarendon hotel. The service is typically very good. I can't complain, they get it all right. I haven't tried their breakfast yet, but that's on my to-do list.

Bleh, not much good to say. I went here with a friend who had a coupon and likely won't return.  We started with a caprese salad. The tomatoes were good, there was very little mozzerella cheese and the cheapish balsamic vinegar was heavy-handed. The bread they served with it was average, not great but not horrible. I had eggplant parmesan for my entree and it was bland. The eggplant still had the peel and it was very tough to cut. Apparently, it didn't come with any pasta...which seemed odd to me. Most places serve it with pasta. My friend had the Shellfish Risotto. It tasted pretty good but the rice lacked that creaminess that is associated with risotto. Our waitress was friendly but seemed out of place at this restaurant. She forgot my friend's to go bag until asked to get it back.

A longtime favorite of mine. So great to see him back in Town and Country. And I can now walk there.

I have been a follower of chef Doug Robson all the way back to his days at La Grande Orange. Gallo Blanco was a favorite and when he opened Otro, I was ecstatic. The food is always fantastic, the service quite good and the atmosphere, tough to top, especially with the recent upgrades. The flapjacks are simply the best restaurant pancakes in town, bar none. The tacos are a delight and the guacamole? Heaven. One of my favorite eateries anywhere.

Remember when you were a kid and Dairy Queen was delicious? Then when you got older, you and all your friends lamented how it's not the same as it was any more? Well, Shakes & Cones in Scottsdale felt your pain and they apparently set out to create a soft serve ice cream shop that brings back those memories of delicious, soft frozen memories. Do yourself a favor and stop in.

Misleading dealership tactics. I was interested in a used trailer that RideNow had on their website. The price listed on the website was $599. I called to make sure it was still there, then drove nearly an hour to check it out. I looked at the trailer and was told to sit and wait for the sales manager. About 30 minutes later, the sales manager finally comes out with a quote sheet for over $1,300. $129 in service fees (why wasn't that reflected in the list price?), $400 in doc fees (ridiculous) and $125 registration fee (no problem) plus tax (of course). If you are considering dealing with them, you might want to get a written quote before making the drive.
