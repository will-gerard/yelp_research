After a shaky start with purchasing a car, and going to another dealership, Audi North Scottsdale has redeemed themselves in the service department.  My 2 month old car was getting an error message, so I called over there since they are close to my house.  I was transferred to Jason, who set up an appointment for me on Monday.  He was wonderful to deal with, from the process of being set up with a loaner to the detailed diagnosis of the problem.  I can say that my car buying experience has been flip flopped, it was a breeze to get my car from Peoria, but very difficult to talk to a manager over there.  I am not finished with them yet.

Who thought trading in my 2012 Audi A4 for a 2014 Audi Q5 would be the easiest transaction ever.  After going to North Scottsdale, I met Joe Coleman, who is by far the best salesman I have dealt with.  When a dealership and the buyer can both walk away thinking they got a good deal, you know you got a good deal.  The car with all of the upgrades I wanted was in stock and 90 minutes later I was driving home in my new car.  Their finance rate was lower than my bank, so I kept my loan with Audi Financial.  I have always had great things to say about their service department (especially Jason Brown), and now I can say that this dealership has exceeded my expectations.  Thank you!

Worst airline EVER! My boyfriend and I went to Catalina island for my birthday. We were stranded out there due to a huge storm, with no ferry or helicopter service to get us back to the mainland. Called the airlines to let them know we wouldn't be able to make our flight due to the bad weather and they wouldn't waive the change fee. So $400 later to be booked on a flight the next day. This will be the last time we ever fly them, Southwest will be it from this point forward.

I went here yesterday to purchase a bag.  After searching the internet for styles that I like, I came in armed with the names of about 10 bags.  Stacy was so awesome, she took each and every bag I wrote down for me to try on.  She knew that this was my first LV purchase and she made the "experience" so nice.  I wish buying something was always this pleasant.  I will be back to round off the purchase with a new wallet, with no money to put in there, since I spent it all in the store.

My boyfriend, who introduced me to Vietnamese food, brought me here for the first time about 4 months ago.  It is not convenient to where we live, but it is worth the drive.  I order the #39 and he gets the #4.  The owner knows what we both order and its always delivered quickly.  Their Thai Iced Tea is amazing.

I absolute love the vegetable panini and sweet potato fries.  The aioli that they make is the best, you can forget the ketchup.

I want to give a higher rating, the food was a 4, the service was a 2, the menu on the table was a 1. We thought we were ordering happy hour margaritas but when the bill came they were full price. I guess the little menu they put on the table only had a few items that apply when you dine in. Not cool.

I went here with 2 girlfriends after looking on their website, where it clearly stated that they take competitors coupons (website has since been updated).  After giving them the coupons from a place across the street, they told us they don't take competitors coupons.  We argued for a few minutes, I pulled up their website from my iPhone and showed it to t hem.  They told us that it was for a different location, when right underneath it, it showed their address and phone number.  The girl snagged my phone from me to show to 4 other people in the store, and then finally gave us the discount.  After hearing them talk about us for 5 minutes in another language (we knew they were talking about us because the only English words they threw out were coupon and website) we got up and left.  I would rate the pedi I received a 3, but the service a 1.

The best supermarket...end of story.  I like the covered parking, which helps in the dead of summer.  I haven't had need to use the car wash or valet parking service, but I think that it's a nice touch for people who cant walk far, mom's with kids and the elderly (or just super lazy).  The produce section has items I have never heard of and we have had fun trying new things.  The bakery has items that rival top tier bakeries, at half the price.  The meat department has a great presentation.  The service is great.  People watching isn't as good as Fashion Square, but it's not too shabby.

A group of four came here for dessert and drinks on a Saturday night after dinner elsewhere. This bar is one of the best place for people watching. The butter cake is the most amazing dessert ever. Our tab for 4 cocktails and 4 desserts was about $120, not including tip.  Little pricy, but worth doing once a quarter.  On a side note, I have been to this location multiple times.  The food and service have never disappointed.  The filet and lobster mash are my favorite.  They do a nice presentation if you tell them it is your birthday.

I had my 3 month old Acura finally repaired from the hail damage it received in October.  Guy was awesome to deal with and my car was done in less time than I was told. and looks as good as when it came off the showroom floor.  I highly recommend going here than to Van's or Danny's.

I have been going here for about a year, and have never had a bad experience.  The prices are competitive and the staff is nice. I like that they offer a bottle of water to you after you sit in the chair for your pedi.
