Came into your restaurant hungry and excited to try a new place.  Was seated by an unenthusiastic host person at a nice booth with my toddler.  We decided what we wanted and listened to the gentlemen who came in after us be greeted, receive their drink order, and order their meals.  I did everything short of waving my arms in the air to get the attention of the waitstaff who were actively avoiding eye contact with me.  We got up to leave and complained to a manager as he stared blankly at me and let us leave hungry.  I am writing this from Panda Express where I have received much better service.  Thanks for nothing Oink Cafe.

Creative and amazingly delicious food!  Get the sweet potato tots with teriyaki dipping sauce.  I love the peanut butter and jelly, bacon and sirracha burger.  So good!

Long wait in line is so worth it!  The best barbecue, and an amazing family feeling from the family that runs this better than down home joint.  These people care about barbecue and care about their customers.  Cant say enough about how amazing this barbecue is!!  You can taste the love and care put into these recipes and stoking the flames of the barrel smokers.

Wonderful food and epic beers.  We sampled all the beers for $2 a piece and enjoyed ever single one!  Impressed with the fresh take on locally sourced food and the combination of food and drafts.  Great view of the brew tanks, large bar, and well thought out.  We will be back often!
