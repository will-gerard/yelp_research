I've been going to the Cobblestone Auto Spa for years and I'm always satisfied with their car wash services. I've done the basic $5 express washes as well as the more premium washes, and each time I think they do a great job of paying attention to the details.   I get in an out of there very fast on the express washes, and I usually don't have to wait more than 10 minutes or so on the more premium washes. The attendants sometimes try to upsell me on stuff I don't want or need, but they're not pushy. In fact, they're usually very courteous.   Overall, I dig the service and I think it's a good value for the money--especially on the $5 express wash. One tip--look out for when they have gift card sales, usually around monsoon season. If you buy a gift card with a certain number of washes, they'll give you a few extra washes for free.

Pei Wei is one of our favorite lunchtime spots. My coworkers and I were forlorn when this location was closed for about a week for renovations, but alas, we were delighted when it reopened last week. It was a bit of a puzzle trying to figure out exactly what had changed within the restaurant because nearly everything looked pretty much the same. Maybe it got a little brighter inside?? The good news is that the menu is still the same, and the service is still great.   What I like a lot about this location is that the servers will help you hold a table if they see that you're waiting in line as a group. I only wish that I could get this kind of service at other quick service restaurants! Heck, I can't even remember how many times I've been left hanging with my tray in my hands and nowhere to sit at In-n-Out Burger. My coworkers and I have never had any problems waiting or getting a table together at Pei Wei even when it's super busy, which is much appreciated.   The food is typical Asian fare, but with a deluxe restaurant twist--after all, the place is owned by P. F. Changs. I prefer coming to Pei Wei over going to Panda Express or other quick service Asian restaurants because I can easily customize my order. Each meal (that I know of) is individually prepared, so you can ask to hold certain ingredients from your chosen dishes. The Mandarin Kung Pao chicken is my favorite, and even though I hold the onion and garlic, it's still super flavorful. The portions are pretty big, so when I practice some self control, I'm able to turn my meal into lunch and dinner at home.   Overall, Pei Wei's awesome for great service and customizable food options, so I recommend it as a relatively yummy and painless lunch break from work.

An excellent spa for the ultimate in pampering and relaxation. I've been to the Willow Stream spa twice, and I can't wait until my next spa day retreat there. The treatments are pretty typical for resorts, but what really sets this place apart is the atmosphere. The facilities are spacious and modern, and there are several places for one to sit snd and enjoy the day either alone or with a few friends.  My favorite spot on the inside is the atrium, which is very "zen" with tree cover, chirping birds, water ponds, and teak patio furniture. Sitting there makes me feel like I'm miles and miles away from Arizona. My second favorite place to sit is just outside the treatment area where there are two small waterfalls that flow into what feels like a little private garden.   The amenities are plentiful: a gym, yoga, cafe service, roof top pool, waterfall treatment area, not to mention the bathroom and sauna area. I could really spend all day there. The only missing element is poolside drink service.

Rumbi is a great spot for rice bowls in North Scottsdale. The place is kind of cute--the interior is totally decked out Hawaiian style, so it's a welcomed change from the usual lunch routine.   The rice bowls are pretty good. I almost always get the chicken bowls with teriyaki sauce, and I'm never disappointed. In particular, the chicken is really good--none of that scary brown meat that other rice bowl places have as their standard.   The only time I had a meh experience was when I got the noodles with the spicy Thai peanut sauce. The noodles looked and tasted like greasy spaghetti, so I now know better and stay away from that.   A tip to know is that the bowls come in two sizes, full size and half size. The full size is like a buck or two more than the half size, but you're pretty much paying for more rice. The half size is is pretty good portion for most, so stick with that unless you're uber hungry.

Say it ain't so!!! So sad that this place closed down. My coworkers and I were in shock when we arrived today only to see the sign being taken down and everything being packed up. Now we're all in mourning, wondering where we're going to get our rice bowl fix. You will be missed, Rumbi!

Sometimes policies are great--like "all employees must wash their hands before leaving the restroom." Other times, policies are ridiculous. Today, at White Chocolate Grille, I experienced the latter, which is a shame because I usually experience fantastic customer service there.   The prior two days, I suffered a spat of food poisoning from another restaurant that will not be mentioned, so I've been in recovery mode pretty much eating bread, cheese, rice and potatoes to gently rebuild my appetite. So when I learned that we were going to WCG for my coworkers' going away party I figured I could still partake in the farewell by having a grilled cheese sandwich--an item that's not on the menu, but seriously, what place can't make a grilled cheese sandwich that has other sandwiches on the menu that contain bread and cheese?   I ask for a grilled cheese sandwich, and the waiter tells me that I can't order that. OK, I'm not some difficult eater who hasn't moved off the kiddie menu, so I explain to him my food poisoning rationale, but no. He can't put that order in for me. I ask for the kids menu because I bet it's on there--nope, can't see that. I ask for the manager, but the waiter goes and comes back and tells me that I can order the Rustic Club Sandwich instead. So I proceed to order that, hold the turkey, tomato, lettuce, bacon and mayo. My coworkers were amazed that I was willing to order an $11 grilled cheese sandwich. The price didn't matter to me--it wasn't on my dime. It was the process of finally getting to what I wanted that bugged me. Now, I did get my sandwich, and it was a great grilled cheese, but I must say, it would have gone down better had the policy been bent a little.   It's a shame because I honestly really enjoyed their Grilled Artichokes. I guess I'll just be going to Houston's now when I want to get my "dark restaurant" fix.

Alright, it's only fair that I write an updated review for WCG since I have had good experiences there since my grilled cheese sandwich fiasco. I give the place props for being very easy to work with on last minute reservations for big groups. Several times, about 16 or so of my coworkers and I have decided to do a last minute group outing, and they've been able to accommodate us in a pinch. During our group outings, the waiters and waitresses have provided excellent service, making sure everyone in our large group was well set on drinks and such. WCG, you've won me back.

I'm a relatively new fan to Chick-Fil-A. Those breakfast chicken minis and chicken nuggets are SO damn good that I've had to adopt Chick-Fil-A into my workweek lunch routine.   This particular location is relatively new and deluxe for a fast food joint. The people who work there are very courteous, which at first was a little offputting because I felt like I was getting too much service for a fast food place. Something that I really like about Chick-Fil-A is that they have a fun condiment bar. It's not just ketchup, straws and napkins. They keep a couple types of mayo and mustard packets up there, as well as Purell handwipes (way cool), and even plastic placemats for children--which brings me to my one gripe.   The place is teeming with children. Screaming children. And lots of them. When I was there last week, I couldn't wait to leave the place because it was so loud and the children were so annoying. Luckily there is an area off to the side where you can sit away from the play place, but that's assuming that nobody with kids sits over there. Word to the wise, if you don't like being around babies and kids, go through the drive thru.

Hanny's is a sister restaurant of AZ88--one of my all time favorite places to eat, drink and hang out. It's no surprise that I found Hanny's to be equally provokative, hip and delicious.   The restaurant is located in what used to be a high-end mens department store The interior is chic and modern, yet also very classic. When I was sitting in lounge, I felt as thought I was thrown back to the 80's, but in a good way. I was also very much reminded of the mind bending architecture of AZ88 with the upper story DJ booth and crazy bathrooms upstairs (a must visit spot if you dine here).   The menu offers something for everybody. Pizza, sandwiches, salads and fancy appetizer plates. Even the pickiest eater could find something to eat there. The prices are also very reasonable--I've been to far less chic and attractive places and been blown away by the sky high prices (hem hem, FnB). The full bar also boasts a unique martini menus (like AZ88), and wine is available by the carafe (LOVE that).  I had the veggie pizza, which was a huge thin crust (definitely sharable for 2) and very generously topped with veggies. I washed it down with a carafe of the Malbec-Syrah blend, which I'd recommend to red wine lovers who prefer sweeter wines. I also recommend the donuts for dessert, which I read as a tip on Foursquare. The mini donuts look and taste nothing like real donuts--they're basically fried pieces of fluffy-textured dough covered in cinnamon and sugar. The strawberry pureed donut dip was delicious--I could have eaten a dozen of them if I had no self control.   Overall, I dig this place, and would probably frequent it if I lived closer to downtown Phoenix.

Culinary Dropout is one of those places that just doesn't live up to the expectations that it sets. From the outside, one would imagine that it's probably a pub-type place. Lots of bar food, great happy hour, etc. It's even super dark on the inside with dark woods, black chandeliers and a stage for a band, giving it a Scottsdale chic, but semi-dive type of feel. But the menu just leaves me scratching my head wondering where the heck it came from.  For starters, the appetizer list is relatively short and un-appetizer like, especially for a place that seems to be paying homage to bar food. Note: French onion soup should not and does not qualify as an appetizer, nor does "Yesterday's Soup." Other options included oysters and mussels--two other dishes that seem out of place for the "pub" disguise. There was a long list of cheeses and meats, but that also seemed out of place for a pub. Perhaps I'd appreciate that selection had I been at a wine bar?  Alas, I was able to find two items on the menu that seemed to correlate with the atmosphere--pretzels and fish & chips. The soft pretzels and provolone fondue appetizer is very delicious, as you'd expect any bread and cheese combination to be. The pretzels were small, soft bites and the fondue reminded me of Velveeta, but less salty. The fish & chips, were was pretty much exactly what you'd expect for fish & chips out at a pub. Thin cut fries, cole slaw, tartar sause, crispy fish fillets. Nothing special, but not bad.  Frankly, I don't understand why the place is so dang popular. It was packed with Scottsdale nightlife, so it makes me wonder if most people come for the bar and to say that they're partying at the Scottsdale "Waterfront." I probably wouldn't go back there, unless I had a real hankering for some pretzels and cheese.

Hands down, Long John Silvers has the best fried fish and I'm not joking. I've been going there since I was a kid, and I've never been disappointed, and that's coming from someone who doesn't really like fish. The fish is of great quality and the crispy batter is delicious. The cole slaw is also tasty. The one thing that could be improved upon are the fries, but the hushpuppies kind of make up for that.  This particular location is very clean, and has a fun nautical diner-like interior. The manager of the place is super nice and always greets me and my family when we come in. I just wish the location was closer to home--they need to open some LJS restaurants in Scottsdale!

I've been going to this Great Clips location since I was in high school--dang that's a long time! I get great service, and you can't beat the price for the hair cut. After going there all these years, I can't even imagine paying big bucks at a salon for a haircut when I can spend less than $20 on a perfectly good haircut at Great Clips. The stylists who work there are very nice and do a great job of listening and delivering the exact cut you want. Honestly, save your money on buying clothes and fun stuff, not on an overpriced salon haircut.

Awesome sliders and zucchini fries! I like eating burgers, but I generally hate eating huge burgers that are bigger than my head. Blu Burger definitely has huge burgers, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that there was a slider trio on the menu.   I was able to customize the cheese and toppings, so I didn't think I was missing out on anything by ordering the sliders when my friends were all ordering their custom mega burgers. I added the zucchini fries to my meal, which the waiter promised to me were delicious.   I was not disappointed. The zucchini fries were crispy and delicious (btw order a side of ranch dressing for dipping) and the sliders were also pretty good. I suppose I still consumed a burger the size of my head, but at least it was split up into three smaller portions.

True Food gets high remarks from me mainly for the friendly service and casual, open atmosphere. I especially like that there is a lot of outdoor seating, and the indoor seating is somewhat greenhouse or gazebo-like.  The food tastes pretty good, but my suggestion is not to arrive too hungry. The food is so damn healthy that it leaves you wanting to snack on something immediately after leaving the restaurant. It's a good thing that there are no cookie or cupcake shops around the corner.  On my latest visit, I ordered the organic tomato and roasted vegetable pizza, which was quite tasty, but much to my surprise did not have any cheese on it. I dumped an entire bowl of parmesan cheese on it to make up for it. I wonder if they'll add some mozzarella cheese to it next time I order it. At least that way it'll stick to my bones and drown out my snacking cravings after eating there.

This place is top notch. Last week I was in the unfortunate circumstance of being involved in a fender bender, and my insurance company referred me to 911 Collision Center. The next morning, I took my car there and was pleasantly surprised by the way that the staff treated me. I walked in and they immediately offered me a water or coffee, and they promptly reviewed my car's damage and gave me a quote. An on-site rep from my insurance company was also present, and he explained to me that he was there to make sure that I was treated right. Once I got my estimate, they ordered me a rental car, and off I went. The team there kept me posted about the repairs and my car was ready for pick up in just a few days.  My bumper was repaired with a new manufacturer part and it looks fantastic. I had little paperwork to sign--everything was very matter of fact. They even gave me a lifetime warranty on all the parts and service. Honestly, this was the best car related service I have ever experienced. They turned a stressful and annoying situation into a very easy thing to deal with. Honestly, it was easier getting my bumper repaired than taking my car in for an oil change! I highly recommend this shop and the people who work there.
