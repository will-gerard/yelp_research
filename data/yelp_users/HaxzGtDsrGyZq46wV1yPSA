So the food here is really really tasty and fresh. Their grilled chicken salad is awesome. Also the fruit and cheese plate is delicious and huge. The service has always been friendly and fast and their pizzas are so good.

This place is super hard to find and you'd never think to eat here unless someone refers you. Well I'm referring you. It is awesome! I haven't had anything I didn't like but there gyro is so good. They give generous portions and it is delicious. Also their feta is amazing.

So My wife has gone here for a few years. First of all they are extremely friendly. And if you have dental insurance my issues will probably not be yours. While everyone is very friendly and takes a very personal interest in you, the costs are very high comparatively. They offer programs to help with the cost but even with those it is 2-3 times more expensive then elsewhere. My wife went here for a long time regardless because we liked the place and my wife had some dental work done in which we found value being at the same place. However, prior to her last visit she called a couple days prior to her appointment to find out exactly how much it was going to cost. After she had the serves done they charged her 20% more than what was quoted. We called a couple days later to investigate and the only explanation was that they require more x-rays than they used to. There was never an answer given as to why that wasn't disclosed. I told them we were going to be moving on. The reply was, "If refunding you the money this time will keep your business we'll do that." This was very disappointing. There was no regard for refunding the money because it was what they disclosed to us. There was no regard for doing the "right thing." It was simply we'll do it if you won't leave. This did NOT make us feel valued or as if there was a personal relationship but rather they would only do the right thing if they could get something in return. Such a sad ending to an otherwise enjoyable experience.

Cary is awesome! He is the most honest and straight forward guy much less mechanic. His prices are extremely reasonable and he does GREAT work. He does what he says and stands behind his work. Cary will change how you feel about mechanics!

This place has new owners and MAN! I was so impressed by how they run the place. They truly care what their customers think and desire their customers have a wonderful experience. Went there for lunch and did indeed have a great experience. I got the Greek Salad with Gyro. It was delicious. The salad was fresh with a good assortment of veggies. The dressing was very tasty as well. The pita bread that came with it was SO good. The gyro meat had a flavor that was a little different than most I've had and was a little more greasy than some (not bad). The more I ate the more l liked it. My friend got the Gyro sandwich and really enjoyed it. Good food, good prices and owners that really value you as a customer. I highly recommend stopping by.
