They always do a fantastic job here! Quick-professional- and great haircuts!  If you can call ahead for an appt there is no wait but I've also done a walk in plenty of times and they are usually very quick to get us in.

Overall great experience Everytime I have been in here. Weekends get slammed so if you want a longer massage and more time spent then you need to go in during the week. Very consistent in here as far as cleanliness and service. Always a great idea to call ahead and let them know you are coming to make sure there isn't a wait.

I love their chopped salad so much. I will always get it every time i come. It's the perfect mix of meat, cheese, and the dressing is so flavorful.  The first time I came to Humble Pie I got the fig and prosciutto pizza and didn't love it. It wasn't bad, just not my favorite. The second time I got the bbq chicken pizza and liked it better. You really need to like bbq to get this pizza as it is more bbq than your typical bbq chicken pizza. It still wasn't my favorite but it was better than my fig and prosciutto. I'll definitely be back for the chopped salad and to try another pizza in search of my favorite bc I know it's on the menu with all the choices available!

Have to go with 5 stars because the price is so great. Not the best area but the employees are great and the $20 pedi can't be beat! Hot stone massage included. I also got a $10 Mani and that was great too. Will for sure be back!!

We love the pizza and wings here--I'm not sure what all the service complaints are because we have never experienced any issues with service. We always sit in the restaurant side because children are not allowed in the bar so maybe the service ha better in the restaurant.  One of the best pizzas in town--fresh mozzarella, not greasy at all, thin crust--so good!!

I don't even want to give one star--is there a zero star option?? We have eaten at this Mellow Mushroom at least 10 times since they have opened and but service has always been mediocre.  One of the reasons that we kept coming back is because we kept getting manager comped meals due to a variety of issues this location had.   Tonight we went in for drinks and reverse happy hour after a birthday party at the establishment next door.  There was a group of 20 of us there and after eating a full meal, and sitting there for 2 hours- I had drank ONE drink when I went to order another drink was told that our entire party was cut off from drinks.  Excuse me?? When I asked why exactly that was the bartender/manager on duty sarcastically and rudely said "would you like me to call you a cab home?" and walked away.  With zero explanation and a cocky bartender on his high horse thank you very much but I will never come back to this establishment again.  At 11:30 at night on a Friday night I am not sure what sort of crowd you are expecting but I do not expect to be cut off after one drink. This place promotes their variety of beers on tap and is a BAR.  The service is horrible and if you want drinks/food there are plenty of other choice in the area do do not go to the City North Mellow Mushroom. I highly recommend Modern Margarita or Kona Grill right next door!

Yum yum yum!!!!  Love this restaurant. Great beers on tap-great drinks and the food is fantastic!!  If chef Jesse is working there is a secret menu item he will make for you if you ask nicely--fried pickles and they are to die for!  We had 3 unbelievable entrees---the meatloaf, the chicken and waffles and the burger. All three were so different but melt in your mouth delicious. I would order any one of those entrees again in a heart beat! We were too full for dessert but I'm sure that it would have been wonderful.

*** UPDATE-changed from 1 to 5 stars because Sharon in regional office called me and we worked it out. She was very professional and courteous. Thank you.  I still give the district manager horrible reviews but Sharon's actions make up for that.   There was a mix up and miscommunication on our part with the auto payment when we had already vacated our unit and were trying to cancel. The corporate office told me that the district manager would be able to issue a refund via a check and prorate the 3 days we were being charged in August for our unit. When my husband went in to the storage unit to verbally cancel, the district manager himself, I believe his name was Ryan, also said that he would be issuing a check.  When I called back and spoke with him to verify that the check had been mailed out a month later, he all of a sudden did not remember who we were, and did not have any notes in the computer reminding him, and just read the terms of the lease to me. I explained to him that I understood the terms of the lease but when I called, I was told by not only corporate but also by himself that a check would be issued. All he did was apologize and say he's very busy and runs 10 stores. Horrible customer service on his end and apparently he's too busy with his 10 stores to care about one customer. Corporate did tell me that all refunds had to go through the district manager, but the district manager all of a sudden said he couldn't do anything. He didn't even attempt to try and reconcile the situation or try and make me happy. The customer service is horrible here. Once you're out they obviously don't care about you and don't want any repeat business or referrals. Yes I signed a lease so that's what they fall back on but verbally tell you something different. Very shady.

The comedians were hilarious---Rick Bronson was there the night we went and was the emcee--he is a RIOT!!! . The headliner Dan Soder was hilarious and his opener Mason Pipes was only 22 and so funny. (I may not have the names 100% accurate so I apologize) We had a large group and we were all rolling. I haven't laughed that hard and that much ever at a comedy club.  My only complaint was the way our group was taken care of-we booked as a group and pre purchased tickets but did not have a group reservation or table. The whole process was very confusing. Luckily we had a WONDERFUL young man as our greeter, Dylan...and he got us all a table right up front and together for 20pp. If we would not have been there early we would never would have been able to sit together. It says something totally different on the website as far as groups go and nothing different was explained to us when we booked the group. Very unorganized as far as the check in process goes.

If I could give zero stars I would. I rented a house through this company for 3 years.   While I was a renter their customer service was horrible-poor communication, shady operations, questionable company-I had things wrong when I moved in to the property that were never fixed and a year after I moved in they tried to tell me I was responsible for fixing the items. Thank Goodness I had them documented on the check in list as they sent me a notice telling me I had to have them repaired at my expense!?  There was a broken skylight and ceiling damage that never got repaired the entire time I lived there.   It's ironic that their attention to detail was so poor and blinded while I lived there, yet they were perfectionists when I moved out. They seize every opportunity to use your security deposit for whatever they can!   The appointment they set for my final walk through the lovely lady in charge of move outs Bev (she's actually the exact opposite of lovely) no showed then started the chain of many lies telling me I had called to cancel. It was hard to get a straight answer from anyone regarding my move out process and I had to deal with at least 3 different people to gets initial questions answered.   Document  EVERYTHING with this company. Any and all communication needs to be documented because they have an excuse for everything.... Staff turnover, computers crashing, etc. I heard them all.   Bev is actually  horrible to work with-she's shady, she lies and she is very unprofessional.  I'm not the first person to complain about her and I won't be the last. It's shocking to me that she still has a job. She says one thing and acts on another. She'll tell you she's doing something tomorrow then 4 follow up emails and two weeks later she finally gets to it (and that's on a good day) A liar with a million excuses sums her up

Love this location and set up! Food was great for Saturday brunch. We got the Cobb salad and carnitas bowl plus 3 different kids meals.  Waffles, chicken tenders and grilled cheese. Lots of food for $4.99 Love how all the game areas are right by the seating so my son could play but still be near by.  We will definitely be going back.  Great place with or without kids!
