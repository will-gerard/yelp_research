I work right by this place and I was impressed with the number of techs they have available at a time. When I walked in it looked like everyone was busy but I still got in within a matter of minutes. Jackie was impressive. She was very detail oriented and she helped me figure out something different to do with my nails. The prices are very reasonable, also! I'll be back tomorrow on my lunch break for a pedicure.

Let me just start by saying that I gave my rating based on other buffets. This one is amazing! They have raw oysters, delicious sashimi, crab puffs, all the classic dishes and even a Mongolian BBQ station. This place is also extremely clean! It blows pretty much all other buffets I've been to out of the water.   On top of all the wonderful food they have a full bar. I think they display the beer so you'll drink that and eat less. Sorry suckers, I'm not falling for it. This isn't my first time at the rodeo! I like beer just as much as the next girl but I'm saving the prime stomach real estate for FOOD and lots of it!   I heard family night was on Tuesday and read that children under 11 eat free after 5pm. If you're a single/unmarried/childless adult I would probably stay away from this night. I read a review once where someone praised a buffet because their children got to run around and release their energy instead of being couped up in a booth. I did see a little bit of this happening at HK but nothing major however it wasn't family night to BEWARE!   Also, you can't use the handy little yelp coupon on family night which isn't fair to those of us who don't receive a discount from that promo but oh well. Moral of the story is don't go on Tuesday!

The food is good but I do not understand how no one has addressed how slow and disorganized they are here. Still sitting here an hour later and we haven't gotten all of our food. Staggering is one thing but the first two came out after about 20 minutes, the third after 40 minutes and still no sight of the fourth. We've asked to close out and cancel the forth and there wasn't even an acknowledgement or apology for the wait. No prices for most of the rolls on the menu either and they don't itemize the bill. The table next to us was overcharged. Hopefully this is a bad night for this small business because the experience has not been a good one and I'd hate to see them go out of business because they're not adequately staffed.

One of the best gel manicures I've ever received. First off they have a crazy amount of colors to select for gel polish which is always a plus. The man who did my manicure was incredibly meticulous. He made sure he trimmed up my cuticles (and they were a mess) even going back three or four times to get everything. And then he did at least two coats of each gel step (bottom coat, color and top coat) and cured each coat under the black light. I am a week in a I have no lifting, no chipping, none of those problems you see as your nails start to grow. I will be back for a pedicure this week!
