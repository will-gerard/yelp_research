Cool place. Clean and plenty of room. But they play smooth jazz before the movie. SMOOTH JAZZ...

Rainbow Donuts is THE BEST. After a confusing mixup with finding a dessert for my wedding reception, the owner, Jason, said they would rush a batch of 20 dozen donuts! They also threw in a few dozen extra and made my wife and I two heart  shaped donuts with pink frosting. Not only are their donuts great, but their hospitality is incredible! They saved our reception and we can't thank them enough!

The Gluch Group is incredible! No wonder they are the the #1 realty group in Phoenix. They have an incredible amount of integrity and really do give their clients excellence.

Burger Rush's food is really good. I especially love their fries. Probably my favorite fries. But their service is complete garbage. I've been in the drive-through to wait 15 minutes for a burger. I appreciate that it's made when I'm there, but there's no way that a fast food burger place should take 15 minutes. So I started to order a pick up since I live down the street. The last time I ordered, I was put on hold for more than 10 minutes, because whoever answered the phone was not capable of putting that order in for pick up? I've also had to wait a half an hour pick up a burger and fries. Seriously, the worst service of any place I've been to.

My wife and I love this place. Velvet chicken and waffles are great, server was awesome, and it's a cool, yet relaxing environment.

This place is awesome! Get the Cookie Cup. Delicious ice cream sandwiched between 2 macaroons. Awesome!
