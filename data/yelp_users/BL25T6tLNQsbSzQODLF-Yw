I have no idea.....how this place has gotten any sort of positive review on the food side. Service was fine, it was quick and young gal was extremely polite and sweet. But my God that was way below average food. I got the beef and let me tell you, their dry shredded beef is not something that should represent the island name. Not good based off that experience. Now to be fair I'm sure the chicken is probably better but I'm afraid to go back.   So like I said, service was good, food didn't match.

Absolutely. Incredible. Crab appetizer. GM was there to service us. Great location. Just stop reading and go eat. Take my word for it.
