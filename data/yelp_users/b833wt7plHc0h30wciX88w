How many wonderful things can I say about this place? It's the absolute best place to take the kids.     It's way bigger than it looks with huge grassy areas with barbecues and picnic tables galore! You could easily spend the day frolicking in the grass, doing cartwheels or throwing the ball around. The playground there is huge and almost completely covered with bathrooms and water fountains very conveniently located. They have 2 different train tracks and a carousel if rides are your thing.   For me, the train museum was the highlight. This you have to see. It's like any kids dream train set. There is so much to look at and see!! Bring some cash because they are trying to build new displays and they are accepting donations. I would have happily paid to get in but it's free so I don't mind donating to keep this fantastic museum going!

This is not my bank but I had to stop in to do some business.   First, I must say the building is stunning. I know that sounds strange because it is, well, a bank but I walked in and my jaw hit the floor. It seems to be made out of an old house or something, with tall ceilings and beautiful wood pillars. Wow.   Second, the girl who helped me was very kind and upbeat. She didn't seem to judge me for geeking out about the building and even admitted that she too geeked out about it once. She was fast and efficient, getting me on my way in no time.

I popped into Safeway today to grab some fruit to make fruit salad and some wine. It started as a simple trip but as I shopped the wine I decided now was time to step up my game and take them up on their 6 bottle deal because really, that's a steal.  After that I headed to get some fruit, I was on the fence on whether or not to get a real pineapple or sliced and then I realized that I know nothing about picking out a pineapple. I asked the produce guy how to pick a pineapple and he was awesome! A wealth of information, even taking the time to help me pick one, giving me advice on ripening fruit fast. Did you know that bananas ripen faster in the bunch? I didn't! I wish I got his name.... I paid and was happily on my way home. On the journey from my car to my house, the wine holder gave out from the bottom and I lost 3 bottles of wine! 3 bottles!!! I took a deep breath and called the manager, hopeful but not assuming, and asked if they could replace the wine. The manager I spoke with was very sympathetic and kind, telling me to bring the receipt and they would take care of me. WOW! Just like that!  I went back (with my own reusable bag) and they replaced my wine, no questions asked. Thank you Safeway! I'll be toasting to you tonight!

When you drive into the parking lot, it seems a little sketchy. You may wonder if this is the place you meant to go or if you have the address wrong. Fear not, my friend, go in.   I was greeted right away by the group of staff members, eager to help. The nice man asked me what I needed and took me to the swatches on the wall. I told him I needed leather or something that looks close enough. He took me straight to the wall of leather and asked how much I need. I wasn't sure and told him about 2 yards. He laughed and explained that leather is sold by the square foot so he got out his trusty tape measure and measured me for the vest I'll be making. He cut me a great deal and a great piece of leather and asked me if I needed anything else.  He was incredible and eager to help.  I will return to this place for all of my leather needs. What a jem!

I'll admit it.   I have an addiction to hair color. I have had every color under the sun and because I change it so often I can't afford to have someone else do it. Plus, I'm kind of a control freak when it comes to my hair and the color it is. Boxed dyes never turn out the way they look on the box so I started taking matters into my own hands and started mixing it all myself with the help of Sally's.   When I first began to pursue that what I fondly refer to as "Ariel red" I went to Sally's and said PLEASE HELP MEEE!!! The girl working gave me exceptional advice, down to walking me through the colors, the brands, the tools I need. She was just as passionate about me achieving my dream color as I was! I proudly sported my bright red hair for well over 2 years. A record for me!  Well now I'm over the bright red but not over the thrill of fun colors. I mean, life's too short for boring hair! I decided to go more natural all over but kept a streak of fun to color whatever I feel the need for at the moment. It's my one piece of fun for my hair. I chose blue. I loved the blue but today when I went to Sally's I had my hopes and dreams on pink.   I walked in and was greeted happily by the nice girl in the back. I returned the hello and made a beeline to where I know the crazy semi permanent colors to be. The only one missing... Was pink. I sighed. Disappointment welling over me. I tried to make another decision. The nice girl asked me if I was finding everything ok. I told her sadly pink is gone. She reached into the box she was putting away and presented a wonderful box of pink goo just for me!!   Yay!!!   Thank you Sally's!!

Since arriving in Arizona, I've made a promise to myself to visit a new coffee shop every week I'm search of the best coffee shop experience that Arizona has to offer. This week's stop was Village Coffee Roastery.   The moment I walked in, I felt an indescribable feeling of joy. I don't know what it was exactly that struck me about this place, perhaps it was the roasting contraption right in the front with a handful of comfy chairs around it. Perhaps it was the blue tile half wall surrounding the bar area or the chalk board menu. I'm not sure what it was but I felt at home right away. The barista behind the counter greeted me as if I was a friend, we chatted a bit about the menu, I made a joke about their "Why Bother" drink. That's a non fat sugar free vanilla latte to those not in the know. I asked about their For Here mugs and he took the time to go over the sizes of the mugs. I ordered cappuccino and he asked if I like it dry or wet and I was blown away that he asked. THANK YOU! As a matter of fact, I like mine on the drier side. I stood by while he started it and he told me to go have a seat and he'd bring it out to me. What service!     When he presented my drink I geeked out over the foam and he asked if I needed a wifi code. So thoughtful! I sat back and enjoyed. I actually found myself sitting there, smiling to myself. Purely and utterly happy. Here's the kicker. Usually, at a coffee shop, I stick my earbuds in and ignore the world for a while. Not today. Their music selection was so perfect, so wonderful that I didn't bother. I could live at Village Coffee. I was one of 4 customers there and it really felt as if I was sitting in my own private, wonderful piece of heaven.   My experience at Village was so great, I want to take a star away from every other coffee shop I've been to because none if them have compared to this place.

It was a little bit of a drive to this place for me but I thought it was worth the trip.     The lady at the ticket stand was super nice , like way-too-nice-to-work-here nice. She offered their rewards card in a non sale pitch way which was really cool. She was totally conversational about it, no pressure just telling us what's up. The girl at the food stand was nice too even though I think she judged me a bit as a I geeked out because I (finally) found my name on a bottle of Coke. I  don't judge her for judging me, I was way too excited.     The theater itself was spacious and very clean, no sticky floors or questionable stains on the seats. I kicked back, enjoyed the movie and turned off my cell like a good little movie watcher.     Overall a pleasant experience at AMC.

I'm not usually the type who goes into a place that is about to close but I did.   I was expecting end of the night glares from the workers there but as I hurried into Howie's to pick up my order, the man behind the counter greeted me kindly. He was just finishing up my order, boxing it with care. And here I was, expecting it to be thrown in with toppings only half still on the pizza.   I apologized for coming in so late and thanked him for his hard work and he told me it was no problem at all. The thing is that he really seemed to mean it. I appreciate the workers at Hungry Howie's, I appreciate the pizza I received because it was just as good as it would have been if I ordered it at 5pm.   Thank you Hungry Howie's for feeding me later than I should actually be eating and being very nice about it.

I'm a huge Mac fan. In fact, I'd call myself a Mac snob, meaning I only use Mac products if I can help it.   Today I swung by to get a refill on my eyeliner since it is one of the things my face is lost without. This was my first time as this location. It was nice and small but had all the necessary tables, fully stocked and ready to roll.   There was a line when I walked in and I kept reminding myself to stay focused, to only get what I came for. This is usually easier said than done but a very nice girl came out from behind the counter and asked what I needed. I told her and she went and grabbed it for me, easy as that. No pressure to add on anything or get more brushes, she simply rang me up for what I asked for. I know that sounds like a simple thing but usually all these Mac girls have to do is say is Are you sssuuurreeee you don't need a new eye shadow? And before I know it I'm spending 50$ so I'm so thankful for and easy in, easy out trip today.

I had never been to a Paradise Bakery and Café before this morning. I had some errands to run at Scottsdale Fashion Center so I cruised by to grab a small snack to call breakfast.  The line wasn't long since the Scottsdale Fashion Center had just opened so I knew I had some quick decisions to make. As I scanned the pastry case, I was surprised they had so many options and was feeling pretty good about my chances to choose a delicious pastry. However, the more I looked the less impressed I became. I'm not saying I'm only happy if a place has a chocolate croissant but I will say it's usually my staple at other places. I scanned and scanned and really nothing popped out at me, demanding I eat it so I went with a safety -a blueberry muffin. I also ordered an iced vanilla latte because the temptation was there. Gregory asked me what kind of milk I wanted. I asked for whole milk which they didn't have. Disappointing. I paid, got my muffin and left. It wasn't until I was about to check in that I realized I didn't have my phone. I went back to Gregory who said it wasn't found.   I went home. I attempted to eat my blueberry muffin which was burnt and terrible on the outside and gooey and under cooked on the inside. The latte was okay, nothing special. We called paradise bakery and café back and asked to speak to a manager who confirmed that yes, they did have my phone. I went all the way back to retrieve it.   A disappointing experience at Paradise Bakery and Café for sure. Customer service and blueberry muffin gets zero stars. The latte is what gave them one star because it was at least drinkable.

Here I am at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.   Let's start with the cup. I opted for my old standby, an iced vanilla latte with whole milk and an add shot. A new barista made it and she did a great job. The espresso is prominent and the vanilla is just an added bonus. I watched the method they use to make the drinks and was interested to find that they seem to use powder for their flavoring which I found to be odd. It's fine, it works.   The music isn't really what I look for in a coffee shop, it's like this soft core indie rock. I prefer more mellow, singer songwriter in my coffee shops. Less half rock, more acoustic. Just my preference.   This place is clean, everything is perfectly swept and tidy. The people working are your average coffee shop people, nothing too amazing but they do their jobs well.   One thing I thought was really cool was I was asked if I wanted to buy a bag of coffee or tea for a soldier. If I wasn't buying my drink with quarters I definitely would have. I've never seen that in any other coffee shop I've ever been in. Kudos to Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf for thinking of our troops this forth.  :)  Overall I'm not blown away impressed but I didn't hate it.

Let me get this out of the way. I'm not giving Whataburger 5 stars because it is a super classy gourmet place but because for what it is, it's the best.   Whataburger is my go for anytime I want comfort food.   Today I went in for a delicious burger, the line was a little long but for whataburger, I'll wait. The manager opened the second register and called us over, he was the perfect combination of fast and friendly, an excellent quality of a manager. As we walked away he mentioned that he's a Giants fan too. Extra points.     We didn't wait long before enjoying lunch. The burger was perfect, the fries were hot and the place was clean, wiped down and ready to sit.     I love this location because it's always open, the food always tastes the same and if you do the online survey you get a free Whataburger. Yes please!

After a bit of running around this morning and afternoon, we stopped in here for a later lunch and were seated right away. I liked the laid back feel of it, sort of like someone's living room with a lot more seating options.   Our waitress was over worked, being the only one to wait tables and during our visit she began to seem more and more over whelmed. I felt bad for her. I'm sure with better staffing she's be a stellar waitress. She apologized profusely when she had to come back and let me know that they were our of roast beef. I'm flexible though so I went with the avocado burger medium rare which was sooo goooood.   The food came quickly and everyone was happy with their food. I'd like to come back another day and hopefully there will be better staffing.

Now that my place is finally all unpacked and ready to start living in, I've uncovered all of my craft stuff which caused me to get the fever. With lots of new ideas in mind, I headed to Michael's.   Their layout is pretty straight forward, the isles and shelves were well organized with no evidence of hungry crafters pulling things off and rummaging through them. I like to make jewelry so beads are my draw to Michael's. I'm going to make a suggestion on the bead merchandising that Michael's will never follow: it would be rad if they were organized by price. All the beads are color coated to match their price point but as a starving artist on the go it would save my time and brain muscles if all the price points were put together. Just an idea. I'm sure the brains at Michael's has a reason for doing it the way they do.   The place was dead so no line for the checkout. Always nice to not have time to wonder if I've spent too much. The girl who rang me up was not interested in small talk which is okay I guess. I'm sure she was busy with something else but I always appreciate feeling like my purchase is important. Oh well.

I love coming here every month for my waxing appointments.   D'Lisa is the owner, specializing in Brazilian waxes and I will have to say she is the best. She welcomes you as you arrive, let's you know when your room is ready and gives you enough time to get situated without leaving you there to wonder if she forgot about you. She chats you up, making you feel completely at ease as if you are catching up with a girl friend. Her waxing style is fast and to the point, always asking if the wax is a comfortable temperature. I'm in and out of there in about 15 minutes.  The salon always had awesome art from local artists. D'Lisa is an art collector and is ver passionate about the artists who create these wonderful pieces.   I love this place, it's my perfect monthly pampering and I will happily be a regular for a long time.

wow. This was the single worst experience I have ever had in a store. That sounds like a bold statement but I am confident that it is the truth. As a usual MAC customer I decided to give Ulta a try since the closest MAC is 35 minutes away and Ulta is a mere 13 minutes.  I walked in and they were busy. I can understand that since it was Homecoming. I wandered the isles aimlessly in hopes an employee would offer her assistance. 3 employees past me without as much as a hello.. not even eye contact. I finally started speaking to my kids in a volume that someone would be able to hear me. "Gee, I wish I could get some help"... FINALLY someone asked me if I needed help. I explained to her that I am a MAC customer but I wanted to see if they had something similar that I could get. I just wanted something to put on before I put on my make up so that it would stick. She told me she would find someone who is familiar with MAC products and she would be right back. I waited. And I waited. And I WAITED. Finally I saw her walking back with someone. She asked her, "Do you know MAC's stuff?" The other girl responded, "No. I Don't know MAC's Stuff and I DON'T like them. Their stuff clogs your pours." Then she looked at me and shot me the dirtiest look. I said, "Thanks that doesn't really help me does it?" She walked away and the first girl disappeared. I waited. And I waited. And I WAITED. Then FINALLY she comes back and informs me that they do not have a product like that.  I walked out. Furious. I doubt that they do not have a product like that at all. I doubt that MAC invented something like that. I waisted 45 minutes in Ulta that day. In that amount of time I could have driven to MAC, got my product and been headed home. I may have picked up a new eye shadow too because the girls there are so awesome. Ulta made me feel stupid for going there.   In all my years in customer service I never would make someone feel stupid for trying to come to my store. If Ulta's products are really better than MAC's tell me WHY. Don't just give me a dirty look and walk away! I tried to call the customer service line and they are closed on the weekends. I tried to call the store and speak to a manager and the phone rang off the hook. I did manage to call the customer service line Monday morning and got a weak apology. Thanks I'll stick to MAC.

I drive by Blanco's pretty regularly and I always notice it. I'm not sure if it's the brightly colored signage or the world "Tequila" that grabs my attention but I always think that it's a place I'd like to try.   Tonight, I went for it.   The hostess was friendly, greeted us right away and sat us right in front of the tv that was playing the 49er game. Was it our San Francisco gear that gave us away?   Our waiter was nice, although I don't think he likes kids in his every day life, he handled it well. He was prompt on refills, checking in with us often, even giving us great recommendations. We all loved the food, many smiles all around.     I was glad we chose Blanco's for dinner tonight, it was everything I hoped it would be. Next time, I'm trying one of their margaritas. :)

The air conditioner at my place broke today so obviously something cold and delicious was in order.   This particular Yogurtland was incredibly slow considering the temperature outside. I was pleased to see that my flavor of choice (chocolate/vanilla) came out of the machine thick and creamy as opposed to the disappointing consistency  at other frozen yogurt locations.   The toppings area was neat and tidy with a wonderfully friendly girl working the scale. I feel as though far too often at places like these the staff has a permanent scowl so it was refreshing to see an employee with customer service skills on point.   During my visit I also saw another employee coming onto the floor and tidying up further than it already was. It was nice to see such a clean location with a great staff.

I love being greeted right when I walk in, that's one thing they got right. There was a man who said hello and asked what I needed before I made it all the way into the store, which was nice.    I told him I was thinking about phones and he added me to the wait list. Little did I know it was a 20 minute wait list! I told him I'd never had a smart phone before because I wanted to see what they would recommend to me. After my long wait someone finally started talking phones to me but I was shocked to find that the salesperson didn't tell me more about the phones other than how much they cost. I didn't mention I was on a budget. I was hoping he'd give me a run through of each phone and what they did , what makes this phone better than that one and so on but no such luck. I left with more questions than answers. Total let down.

This week my quest for the perfect coffee shop experience took me to Echo. I like the trendy name, every time I told someone I was going there I felt very exclusive. I'm a dork. :)    I like the big patio with with lots of big chairs. I walked in and was instantly in love. They have big metal shelves right when you walk in that have books on them. Not like lame books no one would ever want to read but actual, recent, best sellers books. The counter was nice n clean with melittas sitting there ready to brew. If you knew me you'd know that I am a sucker for alternate brewing methods and Melittas are some of my very favorite.   The woman ordering when I walked in was geeking out over the coffee girl's awesome hair and I stood back, relaxed and listened. I'm always open to tips on hair color. The hipster poster child barista asked me if he could get something started for me with a nice, warm, welcoming smile. I ordered a cappuccino, warm, in a for here mug. In fact, the rave reviews of their cappuccinos are what brought me here in the first place.   When I walked up to pay the girl asked if I'd worked in coffee. Busted. She said she could tell by the way I ordered my cup. I'll take it.   Enough of the awesome people behind the counter. Let's talk about the cup. Beautiful latte art aside, the cappuccino was a little wetter than I like them to be. It didn't quite have the texture of melted ice cream like it should. Okay, I'm being picky. The cappuccino was great, the people were great. I'm not saying this is the end of my search but I will be visiting again.

This place looks really cool. When I walked in I was so hopeful as I looked around and saw tons of places to sit as well as little side rooms so that it didn't feel like a cafeteria. I liked the artwork and decor.     I walked up to the counter to place my order and waited while the three employees stood in a circle talking, not looking up once. I started inching to the counter as to say, hey I'm here and finally they looked up and dispersed. I ordered my drink, no one was overly friendly and I felt like they were trying to get rid of me so they could continue their conversation.      All the tables I discussed before were all full, causing me to awkwardly look around for a place to go. I stayed for a while in the only seat I could but ultimately felt a bit uncool.     The coffee was nothing special. The most uninteresting latte I've ever had. I will skip this coffee shop in the future.

I like this U-Swirl. A lot. I like it so much that I eat there fairly regularly which is not exactly the best for losing weight but if you are going to do it, this is the spot.  The tables are always clean, it's never too crowded or busy and the staff is great. I'm really big on employees that remember their regulars and thus location really does a great job with that. I've never been to a frozen yogurt location that had such friendly and engaging people before.  Keep it up, U-Swirl. I appreciate you.

I went into Einstein Bros. bagels today because I needed coffee and I didn't feel like driving to Coffee Bean so I decided to be spontaneous and try something new.   The menu is a little overwhelming to someone in a time crunch who had never been there before so I stood trying to decide for far too long. I let the lady behind me go ahead while I tried to make a choice. When she was done I ordered my iced vanilla latte with whole milk and was told they don't have whole milk. (Seriously what's with Arizona not having whole milk anywhere?!) i ordered it anyway. I was still indecisive and sort of hoped the guy taking my order would show some initiative and make a suggestion. He didn't. I finally decided on a bacon and egg bagel and tried to make some jokes to get him to smile. I got nothing. He must be a robot. He finished up my order and I waited.   I was happy that I didn't wait long but my coffee was terrible. Seriously awful. Vanilla milk water. I can't even taste espresso. The bagel was okay. It was edible at best. Nothing to be anywhere near impressed with. For a place that prides itself in bagels I expected so much more.   I should have made the trip to coffee bean.

I have been to many Walgreens. It's never anything special. It's an errand, just another check off the day's to do list.   This Walgreens is different. I've been here a few times as it is so conveniently located and every time I am welcomed as if the employees are truly happy to see me.   Today I was picking up some prints that I'd sent from my phone this morning (love that feature!) and as I stood at the photo counter, I watched the cashier interact with other customers. I couldn't stop watching as he chatted with customer after customer as if each of them was a neighbor of his.   I didn't wait too long before someone came over to help me at the photo counter. He didn't ask me what I needed or for my name even. He asked me if I brought him lunch, I laughed and told him I had not. He shook his head and said he knew I'd forget and handed me my photos. He must have recognized me from my selfies.    I shopped around a bit and found everything I needed and then checked out. Kirk has been the cashier I've had every time I've come in. He made conversation with me, like I watched him do with the other customers. Kirk really makes every customer feel like they matter to him. I messed up my pin *twice* because I'm spastic but he was patient. He and I joked about how I must not be so good with the numbers.   I will take off a star for my rating because some of my pictures were cropped in a way that took some heads off and I was super disappointed about that. I don't blame the guys for that but I wish I wasn't charged for those photos.   Overall I love this Walgreens and I'm happy to come back again and again.

I love old bookstores. I love losing myself in a building filled top to bottom with books, surrounding myself in so many words put on paper by people who have sat down to write. It's a beautiful thing.  When I heard about this store, I was so excited. A two story used bookstore with a café?! The very idea is as if someone took my own personal heaven and placed it Tempe. Yes, please.   Now fast forward to me walking in. All the air deflating from my body. There are a lot of books. There is also a café, I suppose. This place is dirty and not in the way that a used bookstore should be dirty, it's dirty in like a sifting through your grandparents garage kind of dirty. There are a lot of shelves covered in books that are old and forgotten, nothing up to date which isn't exactly their fault I suppose but a proper display or two would possibly make the place feel more like a book store and less like a storage unit. There are boxes of who knows what blocking walkways that makes it difficult to roam around. It's eerily quiet in there, nothing going on except the quiet murmur of the employee watching something on his computer, giving me an awkward feeling like I'm not supposed to be in there. Some music would really liven the place up.  I can only imagine what this place could be like with proper care, there is so much potential. The whole experience was lost for me, I really couldn't wait to leave.

Let's talk about Cartel Coffee Lab in Scottsdale. Let's!!  This place makes all of my coffee nerd/ trendy hipster senses tingle with glee. When you first walk in you'll notice there's art on the wall, and long couches, long tables. I actually love the furniture in here. There's a little indoor/outdoor hallway on the side that has a comfy couch and tables, one of which has a chess board, if you know how to play (which I don't).   Then the coffee stuff. This is what I love the most. They have all brewing methods. French press, chemex, aeropress, you name it. Not to mention a manual espresso machine and hand poured latte art. GAH!  The two guys working today are perfection. They are fun, friendly and efficient. Not to mention they make a killer latte. Yum. :)  Also, I had a blueberry muffin that made my tummy very very happy.   I love Cartel Coffee Lab. I will come back again and again.

This was my second time in Wag N Wash. The first time was just a stop in during our walk but today I took my pup in for her MUCH needed nail trim.   We walked in and right away were asked how we were doing and what brought us in today. They took her up right away. The groomer, Stephen, was great! He was quick and made my pup feel at ease. He asked about her and we chatted a bit about where she had come from and how long I had her. He gave me tips on potty training my stubborn (but adorable) pup. She was good and didn't get all crazy.   After, we had the opportunity to roam around, looking at their wonderful selection of toys, when another nice employee came over and asked what we were looking for. I admitted that I had no idea what to get. She was helpful and made great suggestions, telling me about all of their products and the benefits of them. I chose one of their Tuffy toys.   Then we cruised over to the doggie bakery. How friggen cute! If I didn't know better I'd think it was a real bakery since there was doggie cupcakes, doggie birthday cakes, little doggie cookies and everything! Baked right there in the shop. We didn't get one this time but definitely will next time.   I think my pup and I will go there often. From customer service to product knowledge as well as product variety this place has it all. A dog's paradise, really.

My daughter and I sometimes spend a little one on one time together to maintain the all important closeness between us. Today I suggested we go and get pedicures. I searched for a place that has those awesome kid's chairs but the only place I found was booked until afternoon so we headed to a place more local and found Moriah's.   I liked the environment at Moriah's and the lighting was low and relaxing. I asked for two pedicures and the girl helping us eyed my daughter as if it was the first time she'd ever seen a child. I was surprised by this since this is not the first time I'd taken Mini Me for a pedicure.   As we sat down, the ladies eyed us as if I might be the worst mother in the world to take my daughter to a nail salon. It made me really uncomfortable. It's not like I was getting her acrylic nails and a weave. We paint her nails at home all the time.   Immediately after the pedicures, they took my payment and told me to have a nice day, not in a way that made me feel like she genuinely wanted me to have a nice day but in a get out now kind of way. Again, I felt uncomfortable.   I thanked her and handed her a tip for her and the girl who worked on my daughter and she didn't even look up to say thank you.  I don't expect great customer service at a nail place but I do expect to feel like a decent person after I leave. I've never felt like a bigger pain in the butt for coming into a place of business. I will not return to Moriah's. There are too many nail places in the world to go back to a place like this.

After reading about this place on yelp I've been eager to try this place. It's nearby and the reviews had me certainly intrigued.   We showed up about 20 minutes before they opened which we spent looking the pictures of the dishes on yelp, salivating and mentally choosing our early dinner. When I sat down I told myself no cocktails... Until the drink menu arrived. With a full list of hand crafted cocktails at your fingertips, how do you not go for it? Especially during happy hour? I couldn't and you shouldn't either. Mine was so refreshing I'm not even sorry.   I ordered the clams served in wine and essence of heaven. I loved every bite. It was a little spicy for my sensitive pallet but it was worth it. The bread, that they bake themselves, was incredible. Our waiter was very kind and patient, giving lots of great advice. Not only did I love my meal but I can't wait to go back and try something new! Pig and Pickle, I love you.

I love this place. Mini-me and I were due for some bonding time so we headed here since our experience was pleasant last time.  I love that they have little chairs for her, it makes the experience for her better and makes us feel welcome.   The hours weren't posted on their yelp listing but we headed over there with our fingers crossed and luckily they were open. (M-S until 6 and Sunday until 5). I'm always nervous to go to a place less than an hour before closing because I assume I'm going to get poor service. Luckily, this wasn't the case. The ladies were friendly, chatting with us for a bit but mostly we enjoyed the nice warm water and foot massage on this ugly day. I can tell you with much enthusiasm that the spa pedicure is the best, well worth the extra.  I don't mind driving the extra distance to this place. Well worth it.

I'm new to the area so I'm still trying to find my new... Everything. Finding a new girl to cut my hair was something I was very nervous about. I don't believe that a good haircut ain't cheap and a cheap haircut ain't good. I believe you can find someone who knows how to cut hair in any price range.   I made an appointment and the girl on the phone promised me she was setting me up with one of their best. I hoped she was right.   My appointment was first thing in the morning which was awesome because I was greeted by the whole staff the moment I walked in. My stylist, Marquel, was warm and friendly. She and I discussed what I liked about my hair and she got started. She made sure to check with me before making any drastic changes to what we'd discussed.   I love my haircut! Not only will I not be going anywhere else but I highly recommend Marquel. I was able to get a shampoo, cut and style for 30 dollars. A steal for how talented she is.

There's something soothing to me about stepping into a place like Zia. You step through the doors and instantly you are taken away to a place where people have dumped off music that isn't their taste anymore which is just fine because that is exactly where your music tastes are now. It's like an older brother or sister is passing along their old tastes to you except Zia is the middle man.   I could look through used music for hours on end but luckily this location is so well organized you don't need to. The staff is fantastic. I love to be greeted right away and they never disappoint at this location.   I do wish their merchandise got changed over more frequently though. I feel like every time I go there the middle tables have all the same stuff on them.   Overall Zia is a great place to pick up a CD that will fit the mood you are in right now. "And if you ever get lonely, just go to the record store and visit your friends."

I was offered a free tanning package all I went in today for a visit. I was uneasy after reading the terrible reviews on yelp but I'm a maverick and bad ratings don't scare me.   I walked in and waited about 3 minutes before Mariah came out to greet me. I liked that the way it was set up it felt more like a health spa than a cheesy tanning salon. I told Mariah I was a super rookie and she was great, taking me on a tour, explaining how everything worked and the difference between the beds. She was so great and treated me like an important client. She recommended some great lotions and set me up with a tanning bed.   The tanning experience was very relaxing and fun. I'm not saying I'm going to be a super tanner but for what it is I enjoyed myself thoroughly.

I am extremely disappointed with my experience at Sushi J last night.  We were seated right away, the bus boy was kind and took our drink orders and after a while our waitress followed. She took the orders of half our table and put her book away, thanked us for our order and I reminded her that I still needed to order.  We waited. And we waited. Finally the first of our order came out and we waited some more. It's fine that it came out a little at a time but the wait in between each was very long. I watched as people who arrived after us received full orders while I was still waiting. After 30 minutes of waiting for my last roll to arrive, I wasn't hungry anymore and wanted to cancel the last roll. Everyone around me had finished their dinners and wanted to go. I was just about to tell them nevermind when it arrived, 40 minutes after ordering. We asked what took so long and the waitress, non apologetic, told us they had a lot of take out orders. I took that to mean that all the take out orders were more important than me, who was sitting in their restaurant, waiting. She still wasn't apologetic when she said she would give us 10% off. In fact, at our complaint she seemed irritated, playing more to the idea that my satisfaction was meaningless to her as she had more important customers to tend to. In short, I will not be returning to Sushi J. If their take out orders are so important to them, perhaps they should switch to a take out only restaurant. Maybe then, in house customers won't be such an inconvenience to them.

I have a dirty secret.   After I drop the kids off at school, I go through this drive thru to get my day going. I'm not proud of it but you know, sometimes it's something that has to happen.   However, if you have to do it, this is the one you want. No matter how long the line is, it moves fast and the voice in the speaker box is anyways friendly and upbeat.    The very best part of this location is the star of the drive thru, Bob. Bob is awesome. He is always glad to see me, treats me like a regular and makes me laugh. Everytime I drive away, I'm chuckling to myself about something Bob said. He makes my day, every day.   The coffee is... Starbucks. I don't love it and I openly hate myself on the inside for drinking it but Bob makes my self loathing worth it.

I don't bowl very often, this was the first time I've been in a bowling alley since moving to Arizona and I was very impressed by this place.   It's clean, trendy and has really cool red lighting. The employees were really friendly and checked on us regularly, asking if we were having a good time. The Fundue we ordered was really good and the drinks were awesome. I've been to some really sad and dingy bowling alleys but this one was great. I really like that they don't charge up front but tell you to bowl until you are done and you pay after, giving you a no obligation to finish games you already paid for. We bowled two games and had a great time. I'd love to come back to play again.

After visiting my closest Michael's and cleaning out their stock of the beads I needed, I took the journey to this Michael's (after making some phone calls) to complete my project.   Even after telling myself not to shop around because my beads were on hold at the front, I did anyway. I was very pleased to find that they have a HUGE selection of beads! Oh, I could spend all day here! They had stuff I hadn't seen at the other location. I found myself picking up (and putting back because I have self control) so many great things! Oh so many ideas!   My beads were on hold just as I was promised they would be. I was greeted by their friendly checker who didn't mind a little small talk which I always enjoy. She bagged up my beads and thanked me for coming in.    Another great Michael's experience.
