Had a few people tell.me about it, like Asian dishes and decided to give it a try. They also serve Italian food, kind of weird. Its not the typical hole in the wall feel. feels like a small coffee shop.   Got the pad thai and added chicken. Was presently surprised at the amount of chicken that was on the plate. That soon was wrecked when I found multiple pieces of pure fat and the food was bland.  The kitchen staff is loud, saw another employee give the cooks cash (I assume tips) them handle it and not wash hands. I immediately stopped eating, finished my beer and left.  Not a good expierence, I won't be back.

Don't come here much. Food came out quick and pieces are great.   If you want decent Mexican food and your in the area stop by.

I went in for a quick Garmin purchase. After 10 minutes of finding no one to unlock the case I called the department, I heard a portable phone ringing and it stopped so I called again and followed the sound it was an employee ignoring the customer call.... Epic fail Michael in electronics

This location is never packed during happy hour, big TVs and patio area. Staff don't bug you!! Great part. Happy hour is reasonably priced and a decent selection.

I have been going to ChiroFit inside Gold's Gym since 2007 when I was the gym's General Manager. Dr. Stamp is awesome, very knowledgeable, personable, and always fixes the issue!  I recommend this office for chiropractic and sports injury recovery
