I have never ordered a chicken gyro and received something so disgusting. The "chicken" was a flattened hunk of mystery meat. It looked like a couple slices of thick turkey lunch meat packed with fillers.   There was no way it was going in my mouth.   I pulled it out and then tried to eat the--now veggie--gyro. It was still awful. The tzatziki sauce was so bland it could have been water. The pita itself was nothing special. And the water from the soda fountain dispenser tasted worse than tap.

This place was the best Chinese food I've found in the area. I ordered the vegetable fried rice and received a heaping portion with large chunks of vegetables. Yum. Everything tasted fresh, and seasoned well.  Our waiter was polite and attentive throughout the whole meal and I felt very taken care of--which is abnormal for most Chinese restaurants. Am I right?  He also brought us some complimentary freshly fried chips with sweet & sour sauce.  The price was very reasonable. I will eat her many more times.

Yummy BBQ. I love the pulled pork sandwich. The ribs are insane. Even their salads are incredible, which is rare for a bbq joint.  Hint: If you only want water, their water cups are the largest I have ever seen and they are free. I appreciate that. I also love that they leave out thickly sliced lemons for my water.

I have been a fan of Village Inn all my life. This is comfort food at its best. I always love their french toast and pancakes. At this location, the service has been pretty consistent and speedy, even when they're super busy. And everyone is generally nice.

This place is great. We eat here, probably once a week. The Phad Thai is fabulous--my favorite--but everything else is great too.   The staff is from Thailand, and they are extremely nice. The decor is lovely.   Also, they'll do many of their dishes with tofu if you're vegetarian.

We go here every now and again. There is always something enjoyable to find and eat. And the good thing is, if you don't like what you pick, you're not committed to it.   The breakfast is one of my favorite times to go, because I like to get eggs, pancakes, and french toast--but in small portions. I also, even though I shouldn't, try a little of their cinnamon bun...their mouth watering, icing drenched, artery clocking cinnamon bun. Sooo good.   I also love the new chocolate waterfall--even though a hate seeing all the little kids go up to it and stick their fingers in...Yuck!

I've eaten here twice and it won't be happening again. The food was not good, in my opinion. I usually get the chicken pita at these joints. Here the chicken was tough and tasteless. Oh, and over priced.  My friend got a Greek salad in a pita and, after inspecting the contents, found that there was lettuce and very little else. We brought this up to the server who said with a shrug, "That's just how they're made."  Pretty good way to lose two customers.
