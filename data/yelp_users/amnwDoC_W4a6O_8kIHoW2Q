Last night a few friends and I went to yogis for sushi. We weren't sure what to expect but we thought why not? I ordered 4 rolls for myself and a few, first the cook scoffed loud enough for me to hear and said I don't like making sushi. Well dude it's just a job you get paid $10th/hr to do, maybe you shouldn't say that to the customers face?   The rolls themselves were HUGE, which wouldn't be too much of an issue if they didn't fall apart. They did not stay together at all, they were very poorly made. Sure I wasn't expecting perfection but they were difficult to eat. The quality of the fish tasted low and there was an excessive amount of cream cheese. My two rolls were still $20, I expected them to taste quite a bit better. My friends rolls were also large and fell apart. They seemed rushed, there were 3 other people in the store, there was no rush.   We have agreed to not return here again, it was not worth the money. Also, I haven't eaten since last night because I've been in and out of the bathroom since about 9pm. I don't have food allergies or sensitivities and I don't want to blame yogis but it is oddly coincidental

If I die 10 years early from coronary artery disease because of the delicious fatty brisket, I'm ok with that.

Wendel definitely knows his muscle physiology and how to work out specific issues. It was absolutely the best massage I have ever had. Other massage places charge you for an "hour", but it really turns into a 45 minute massage. Wendel gives you those 15 minutes you pay for and I felt great for the rest of the week! I work in the medical field and let me tell you, after a 90 minute massage here - I have never been more relaxed in a high stress work environment! Highly recommend!

Yowaffle is amazing. The waffles are pretty epic if you ask me. They are Belgian style but so thick and dense. I would go there just for the waffles. Their new fro-yo flavors are great too. So much flavor and I like the variety. The staff are cool and very helpful/nice. Especially Tristyn, she's awesome.
