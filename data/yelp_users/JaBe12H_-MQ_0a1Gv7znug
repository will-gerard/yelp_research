Einstein's is ok.  The food is kinda bland... Not much you can do with an unseasoned, microwaved egg thrown on a bagel served scalding hot. Their coffee and bagels are excellent.  Don't get hooked on a specific bagel for too long or it tends to disappear (Onion and Pretzel).    I always go to this location on the weekends--It's always busy.  When it gets busy, the staff responses tend to be terse and they seem grouchy.

Our AC went out on one of the hottest day of the year (114 degrees during the day and 90s at night) and it was unbearable in the house.  We have two dogs and they were quite unhappy as well.  We looked for hotels in the area and remembered some friends stayed at La Quinta before.  One of our main deciding factors to go to La Quinta was the fact that they allowed pets without any fees.   As long as you go into the hotel understanding that it's not going to be a 5-star resort, you'll enjoy it.  The check-in area was clean and looked inviting.  The hallways were clean and bright.  The room was standard, but our room had a fridge, microwave and couch (executive suite).  The bed was comfortable (better than my bed at home).  The sheets were crisp and very clean and the pillows were awesome too.  The TV in the room had HD channels and appeared to be a full selection.  Best of all, the room did not smell or look like other pets had been there.  If you're not from the area, it's situated in a great area for food and entertainment.  A little downer were the bathroom cups--they weren't glass, think office coffee area but wrapped individually.  The bathroom was quite plain, but I didn't really mind.  The continental breakfast was pretty good as well.  Make your own waffles, muffins, toast/bagels, cereal, coffee and juice.

I'm not sure why it took us so long to try this place.  We used to live close to this place, but didn't try it until we left.  Sure this is a chain restaurant, but it knocks it out of the park for me.  The restaurant is very nice on the inside and the food matches.  I always order the chile rellenos and they are stellar! Usually we order the avocado cream dip for an "appetizer" to go with the chips that come to the table.  It's probably just avocado with sour cream mixed in, but it is so flipping good.

I am changing jobs and stopped in to get some ideas for slacks and a possible suit.  The salesman, Iva, greeted me, promptly measured me, and showed me some pants.  I informed him that I had no plans to purchase today.   He had me try on some pants to check for sizing and promptly started marking the pants for tailoring.  I then reminded him that I was not purchasing today and he said "oh..."  After having me change back into my clothes, he disappeared.  He dropped me so fast, it was unbelievable.  I saw he was helping someone else so I asked one of the men that does the tailoring how long it usually takes, and left the store.  I then realized that the salesmen, are just that, salesman.  I felt like I was buying a car, when I told them I was not buying today, they dropped me flat.    I will probably go in again when I need some slacks tailored because I know they do a professional job (I have a suit from them).  I was just frustrated with this experience because of how I was treated.

This is my new favorite weekend breakfast spot!  They have great specials and the service is great.  I've only had breakfast at this place, so I'm not sure how their lunch/dinner options fare.

Fast breakfast service. Sometimes a long wait for a table. Order less than you think you'd normally eat--portions are huge... Almost too big (borderline wasteful).  I've only had breakfast here.  To me, there is nothing really special about this place.  It seems pretty "dump and serve". The gravy for the biscuits and gravy tastes like a powder mix with some sausage thrown in.  The biscuits are big, but tasteless and generally dry.   The breakfast prices are inexpensive for the amount of food you receive.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this coffee shop.  It was later at night and I wanted coffee.  My roommate mentioned a coffee shop he drives by everyday on his way to work.  We stopped in.  The first impression I got was a very calm and relaxed place to have coffee, socialize, or do work.  The second impression was, I could plant myself here all day.  I'm not a coffee snob, but loved the flavor of the espresso in my americano.  I'm not sure what chai mix they use, but it's awesome.    Drive Thru makes it easy in the mornings too.

We usually frequent this restaurant on the weekends, when yes, it can get busy.  However, the wait, is definitely worth it.  On the weekends, they usually serve coffee out front while you wait.  I have never had a problem with my order coming out incorrect or taking forever.    I have two favorite items to order: Veggie Interesting omelette or the eye opener combo.  The coffee is always fresh and perfectly brewed for me.  The wait staff are very nice and efficient.    Seating can be inside or outside.  They have misters  and umbrellas outside for the hot mid-mornings.

All of my co-workers raved about this place and I finally had the opportunity to try it at lunch.  Wow, this was the most amazing burrito I have ever had.  For me, the flavor was out of this world.  There are other chain restaurants that make burritos that should shudder.  This place rocks.  I have only been two times and am entirely hooked.  the green pork burrito is my favorite so far.    One piece of advice, if you plan on stopping in for your lunch break (12 p.m.), I would order in advance to save you time in line and waiting for your order.  Seating is all outside, Beach House says it all.

This place was pretty good.  We went during the day and had awesome service.  Their burgers are big.  I had the chorizo burger and my friend had the open face filet mignon burger.  I was hoping that the chorizo burger would have been a little spicier.  It was pretty mild.  Sides are a la carte.  We made the mistake of ordering two sides, and of course the server did not warn us that they are huge!  We ordered the sweet potato fries and onion rings.  The alcohol prices were reasonable.  However, the regular drinks (pop) were more expensive than a draft beer.

I love the cupcakes from this place!  I think they have two locations now, but I've only been to the one at Arrowhead Mall.  They guys are always nice when you're making your selection.  The prices aren't too bad, especially for the flavor of the cupcakes (and frosting).

I love this place.  Their bread is good.  The selection of sandwiches is awesome.  I only get the tuna and it's AMAZING.  The staff behind the counter always appear chipper and happy to make your sandwich.

This place is awesome.  Huge amount of food for the price you pay.  We always go home with leftovers.  Lunch specials are pretty much the same as the dinner potion, just cheaper!  They are very fast and everything is fresh-made--not sitting in a pan ready to heat up for you.  The employees are very nice and patient when you can't make up your mind.  This is my new favorite fast-food chinese place!  UPDATE:  The owners of this restaurant have changed.  The four star rating is only applicable to the previous owners.  I might update it if I ever go back.  The new owners say the food is the same, but it's not.  The previous owners were much more personable and knew what you liked and how you liked it prepared.

We decided to eat here on our way to the DBG.  I'm glad we stopped in.  The burgers are awesome.  I tried their cheeseburger and my friend had the teriyaki burger.  Both were amazing.  Great location!

We ate a late dinner here last night.  For our first time, it was pretty good.  The introduction to the restaurant was not great--we've never been to a conveyed sushi restaurant before and weren't quite sure how it worked.    We ordered an appetizer of fried calamari... It was amazing!  Perfect size and it was only $3.  Then, we began making our selections from the conveyed selections.  Between the two of us we were shocked to see that we only spent $30 (before tip) and that included one sake bomber and a regular drink.  They have a lot of other items that can be ordered from the menu in addition to the conveyer belt.  Next time, we'll try some of these items.  One thing I would recommend to this place would be to have a list that details all of sushi names and their ingredients at the table.  There are some on the belt that do not have the ingredient list on the menu.  This was a little frustrating, but the wait staff were quick to explain the items.  For Instance, Monkey Brains... What the heck?  It turns out it's a mushroom stuffed with spicy crab that's tempura fried.  It was awesome!
