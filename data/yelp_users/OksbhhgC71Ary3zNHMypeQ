I've never had a bad meal at Pane after four years... maybe five. From the moment I set foot inside, it took me back to a hip, LA kinda vibe. Small, not a lot of menu choices, fresh, organic food selections... and BUBBLE UP... the Malibu of pop, people.   The food is simply done and quite delish. I usually alternate between the Sopressata and the Mozzarello/Tomato/Basil sandwiches, or go with the Caprese Salad. They make the bread onsite, the basil is grown locally as is most of the veggies.   The crowds get pretty big after 11:30 a.m. and don't die down until around 1:45 p.m. They close at 3 p.m because Chris would head down to Pizzeria Bianco for a busy evening. Apparently he is taking a back seat due to some health concerns. I hope it doesn't affect the food quality but I'm sure his staff will continue his tradition of fresh, tasty and simple.   ** Word of advice: Do not crave this place in August. They shut down for a month-long vacation!! Oh, dread!

Ah, the Dungeon. How I miss thee. I don't go nearly enough as I should. I blame my Old Town location.   Anyways, downstairs has a dark vibe with a cozy seating area, fireplace and small bar area. The bacon-wrapped scallops are YUMMY, the tenderloin toast YUMMY YUMMY and, of course, the Malibu completes it all.   Word of advice, cell phone service downstairs is pretty obscure... at least on AT&T and t-Mobile networks.

The gals buying are always super friendly and go over why some items weren't selected. I appreciate that. The manager is also quite friendly!   SELLING CLOTHES Maybe because the area has more professional business women but I do well with certain items here. I bring my Ann Taylor and WHBM, along with Banana Republic and other decent work attire brands.   BUYING CLOTHES I've found some great jeans in small sizes (24-25) here! R&R for $35. Yay!!

All I can say is... when I die, I hope Heaven is the Royal Palms with endless amounts of Malibu Rum and trips to the Alvadora Spa :)  Their spa is by far the best in the metro-Phoenix area. Attendants and masseuses give five-star service is, time and time again, the single best hour of my life when I get to splurge and visit them. But worth every bloody penny!  The grounds are pristine and an oasis in the Phoenix desertopia. Secluded south of the Camelback Mountains, you'd be amazed at how removed you are from the 3+ million people in the area. It's just that fabulous.   The staff and valets are always accommodating and rarely have I ever saw or heard them get snooty as a few have complained about.   The pool and bar is a must visit :) Especially during the eight months of summer in the Valley. The only downer... sometimes they just don't have enough loungers. But they quickly remedy that upon request.

The AMC does a great job of using multiple theatres for the blockbuster movies. Although they are usually all quite full, I've never run into the disappointment of not getting to see a movie because it's only in one theatre.   The staff is super friendly and I like that fact that I see "handicapable" folks on staff. I don't see that at Harkins. You can also usually bring in food and drinks from nearby establishments. They have started to prohibit that in other theatres but last week I didn't have that problem at AMC.  AMC changed prices recently but I do like the early discount. Plus they do a great job in the summer of offering a kid's series on Wednesdays.

From the day I brought a newborn kitten in, I was hooked. Jeanette and the gals up at the front desk expressed immediate concern about the baby and without me even being a client of Family Vet Care, they took it in the back with another litter of young cats. I generously donated money to a fund to assist with their efforts. Even offered to help, and learn, how to foster.   Sadly, Rosie only lived 11 days. But the 15+ other kitties we've fostered over the years, plus a dog... have all lived and are the most wonderful pets. People that adopt them always remark how amazed they are at how loving and friendly the cats are. When you get them at birth, it's not hard to shape their character :)   I could name so many people who have helped take care of my four-legged children at Family Vet Care. From the front desk, to the technicians and vets on staff, I've never had a less than great visit.   No matter where I live in the Valley, they will always be first on my list when it comes to animal care. From follow up phone calls, to cards and customer service, they demonstrate compassion and professionalism.   Wish I could give them more stars :)

When you can get rasberries, strawberries or blueberries 2 for $1 you know you're getting a great deal. English cucumbers at the grocery store can run $1.99 each. At SSR market, usually 50 cents. Roma tomatoes for homemade salsa... 50 per pound. That was a few weeks ago. But every week, they have great deals on SOMETHING!!   With all the retirement communities around, the license plates are all represented here, and can occasionally be cause for frustration, thus the four stars. I usually visit during the week and avoid the overcrowding on weekends.

Food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends. If there were more breakfast choices around this area, TBC would be empty.   I've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold, plus the order was messed up.   The outdoor patio on the side street is nice but the Scottsdale Road side gets quite noisy with the traffic.  Wait staff and hostesses are nothing fabulous, not overly friendly considering the price and the wait.   Maybe I should down a couple Malibu drinks before I come for breakfast and it would be a better experience.

Casual and laid back  bar with a great patio area. Service is usually pretty good as is the food. Only complaint is their margaritas taste like turpintine. And they recently replaced my Malibu Rum with... yes, that fake Parrot Bay sh*t. They just lost a star!!

What kind of sports bar doesn't serve SLIDERS??? Nachos, quesadillas, and celery/carrots options but NO SLIDERS??? Guess that just goes hand-in-hand with the NO MALIBU RUM option!! At least the bartender asked me if their fake option was okay first. Hello... no!!!!   Wait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 15 minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!!   On the plus side, patio is pretty cool and the pool tables when it's not a busy time!

Updated... they stopped serving Malibu Rum last year so it's no surprise they've closed and changed the theme of the place. MRB REJECT!!  Prior Review: Ahhhh. Happy hour in the islands. Fruity drinks. Lots of Malibu Rum. Wait!! I'm in Scottsdale?? Darn!! Still a cozy little tiki bar with great happy hour specials!! Great, friendly staff. Go forth and drink fruity island drinks, people!

Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well...   Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.

Could I give this place NO STARS???  My girlfriend and I head in and sit down with a group of friends already there. We smile and wave at the waitress to let her know more people joined and she purposely makes us wait at least 10 minutes.  I am not a fan already... but yes, it gets worse, people. She brings our drinks out after another table sits down and orders theirs. Our friends are catching on and order a round. Get them before ours. Gosh, does she discriminate against blondes?? I am wondering. Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings. Didn't get it.  At this point I go up to the manager and ask if the gal is super busy tonight or if something is up in the kitchen. No, and no. I tell him what's going on and he tells me he'll come out in a moment.  Oh... that moment was priceless. He actually said we were rude to her and should be lucky she even continued to serve us. He must be screwing her so I am OUT OF THERE! My tip to folks. Sit at the bar if you must go. There are plenty of other spots out there that will treat you wayyyyyyyy better, have better service, food and prices.

Any bar in Scottsdale with a gravel parking lot is definitely a sign that all things trendy can take a flying f*ck. But I digress... If you can get past the hoards of smokers outside and actually get inside, you have reached the Promised Land of dive bars. Super generous on the pours. Good music. Great, friendly staff. Not too many douchebaggy guys, either. Which is always a bonus in Scottsdale.

I'm probably banned from life here after trying the sake bombers... enter AngrySakeBarbie.   Scottsdale Ra doesn't really impress me. With so many other sushi choices, it's not a destination of choice. Sushi is bland and not anything to write home about. Service here is average if you can get it.    Happy hour prices are pretty decent if you can get a table and keep the servers from ditching you.  We had a group of six and waited 45 minutes for sushi orders. Empty glasses and no follow up on WTF happened to our order. The sake bombers only made my last season Prada-stomping feet go into overdrive.   Enter at your own Happy Hour risk.

Regulars pull rank on the songs with the Mr Karoake dude running the show. But if you stick around, your song will come up eventually. They do need a better sound system. But hey, if you drink enough everyone sounds the same :) Generous pours and decent food.

I came here with a group of hungry guys after the Jackson Barrett car show. Throwing down the booze, eating a ton of food and chatting the night away. They've got a great selection of liquor and that includes my Malibu. Thank you!!  We got a corner booth on a Saturday night (9ish) with no reservation... although we did have to wait about 20 minutes for whatever reason.   Started with the obligatory cornbread. Ya. It's good... and really filling especially when you order a slab of meat for the entree. They know how to cook a medium rare which is always good in my book.   Decor is dark and old Hollywood with a modern flair. Kind of like you are having some clandestine affair-type meeting place. I dig it!

This place would have received more stars had I not had unpleasant experiences.   SELLING CLOTHES I've been bringing in a nice mix of clothes, shoes and purses for a few years now. Staff in the back is always friendly even when busy. Every now and then, I have to raise an eyebrow. Dishonest tactics have led me to sell higher quality items elsewhere.   I brought in a black Gucci monogrammed canvas Pelham purse. Excellent quality. (Thanks, ex BF, at least you were good for something). The retail was $1395. Was told they'd mark it at about $695. It sold in ZERO days and I got $120 for it. (Does this meas someone on staff lowballed it so they could buy it?). The Fendi... same zero days. Some new coach sneakers. Zero days and $10 when crappy ones on the floor are listed at $60. They sell Tom's wedges on the shoe racks for about $18-$22. So my brand new pair sold in zero days and I got $4.   Hmmm, notice a pattern? My friends have showed me their transaction printouts and have some similar stories so I am not alone. I'd bring in average stuff but watch what nice items you bring in.   BUYING CLOTHES I do love their "end of season" sales where you can get up to 70% off marked prices before they change out seasons. I've got some smokin' deals. Otherwise, items are hit and miss. I've found some super cute items for reasonable prices while some others are overpriced.

Great grub after a night out! Their chicken wings are yummy. They have oodles of TVs around the place so you can catch any sporting event on. Breakfast is SUPER GOOD and the portion sizes are large. Prices are definitely within everyone's budget. They do a great job here and the waitresses are saucy gals with great memories. Always get my order correct. Bonus!!

Do not come here if u actually drink anything other than beer. They use a shot measurer & pour exactly 1 shot for a $6 drink. Cheap asses! I've watched a few bartenders do perfect pours on the Guinness so that's a little impressive. The food is okay and the service is okay.  The main thing going for this place is the patio and people you come with. It's in a pretty convenient location so it's not too far for people to meet up when coming from different parts of the Valley.

The last time I stopped in At HoT was with clients for a lunch. Absolute DISASTER. We got our lunchtime libations and ordered. And waited. And waited. And waited. No drink refills. And it was late May so we could have used them.   Finally, our waiter comes over with a light appetizer plate and apologizes that our order wasn't placed properly. Some lame excuse and then... he said he paid for the appetizer out of his own pocket since he didn't want the manager to ream him.   By the time we got our food, it was an hour-and-a-half from when we walked in. Not good in my book. Needless to say, I haven't been back. At least my clients had a good sense of humor and said I pulled a good Trick on them.

I've been frequenting this place for a loooooong time. It reminds me of the funky artsy coffeehouses in LA, around the Melrose District. Their hodgepodge of furniture - Midcentury rejects line the walls and old backlight tables - complement the easy, laidback vibe of the place. Of course, the Mac crowd wouldn't have it any other way.  I haven't ever had a cup of coffee in my life but they always have juice, Vitaminwater and other non-coffee alternatives to choose from. Plus they have a few treats, like brownies, to snack on. This place is MRB approved!!!

I've been here a few times for block parties and private parties. It's nothing great and gets quite packed. I'm surprised the Fire Marshalls don't have this place on their radar.   Guys are pre-Jersey Shore douchebaggy... more Situation than Pauly D. I'm sure Pauly D would be a better DJ than the one they use. Anyhow, don't go for the guy candy, there isn't any. The VIP area is overrated and drink prices are a bit on the high side. Unless they are spiking your drink with cocaine, I'd advise heading elsewhere.

Indie film heaven, folks. Not the recycled garbage showing at mainstream theatres. I've been to dozens of movies here. Always friendly attendants, and a few times they've let us come in with our outside food. Of course, we ordered from their concessions as well so it wasn't like we were trying to be cheap or anything. Pssst, no ICEE machine for those fans craving one. They've let me bring one in a time or two, though!  It's kind of cool being the only people in a theatre at night. It's like Mystery Science Theatre commentary since you can talk and enjoy the movie like you were at home.   I'm not concerned about the old decor, it's the movie I'm interested in. I've never had a bad experience here. Thanks for looking outside the mainstream machine and bringing quality, interesting and unique movie options to the metro-Phoenix area!

I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. I'll take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, it's the BEST omelette I've EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot.   After a hike at Camelback, it's relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks.   The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster!  I've had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best I've eaten. The salads are delish.

Ahh, springtime on a patio for Malibu Rum Barbie. But somehow, I just can't escape being right up at the bar in this darkened cave :) The bartenders are generous with the pours... although the happy hour drink specials are already quite decent.   Appetizers are priced very nicely. My friend had oysters for less than a buck each. I couldn't eat them. Too slimy for me but he said they were absolutely delicious. I prefer the beef on the hot stone and it's done medium rare, of course. The shrimp cocktail is good. All in all, they do a nice job on the both presentation and taste. The only thing I've had at Wildfish that doesn't quite live up to my standards is the bisque. After living in San Fran and eating down at the pier... what can I say?? I'm a bisque snob :)   Good job to Wildfish and their staff. Always a very enjoyable place to visit!!

Malibu Rum Barbie has to alternate this place with the Sangria Slut. Somehow, she found out the White Sangria comes in a Tang-rimmed glass and that floozy loves to lick anything.   But again, I digress people. I have frequented O&I nearly three dozen times in the past couple years. Always enjoy myself as I usually go with a group of friends ready to drink.   Appetizers are delish. Hummus. Yummus. Flatbreads are tasty and you can still get the Pesto off menu. Just ask. They'll do it. Brunch is Fab!!! Unfortunately, my wallet takes a hit here. Their prices are a bit high but I'm sure it's the Waterfront rents that make them do it.

Eewww. I don't like being in a room where it's standing room only, unless you shell out big bucks to sit in a booth. Mediocre guy candy unless you like short guys in Affliction or douche bags in pinstripes. Alas, that seems to be much of Snottsdale these days. I guess I'm a dive bar kinda gal.  I'll save my skanky dresses for Vegas :)

I start with the Mud Pie as I fear eating a slab of meat and visiting the salad bar always leaves me full and Mud Pie is NOT a to-go kind of food item.   The decor is all original from Old Santa Fe stylings. They probably haven't updated the place in its decades of existence. But the CnC folks aren't considered as they focus on the main reason for this visit. FOOD people!!   Mud Pie... get the Mud Pie... and enjoy the Cleaver of other items offered afterwards :)

I leave Malibu Rum Barbie at home when I come to Blue Wasabi. The Signature Martinis have this gal falling of my chair.   I seriously recommend the Mello Jello Martini. Three Olives Cherry Vodka (which turns me into a lush after one, mind you), along with some juice and... a scoop of Jello. I usually ask them to double up on the Jello. And after a few MJs, I'm probably the one you saw laughing and stumbling out of Blue Wasabi (always have a DD folks)!   As for the food, the more I drink the better it is. I love me some Dirty Sanchez. And the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They have such great names for the sushi rolls, it cracks me up. But probably anything does after three Mello Jellos.  The only gripe I have is $30+ for three martinis. And the happy hour specials are okay but not fabulous. I usually spend about $60 just myself. Three martinis, edamame and a couple sushi rolls. Not a fab deal :(   But somehow the Mello Jellos make me forget...

What? No Malibu-flavored gelato? Well, they do have coconut so yay for me! Everyone is always very nice here, and patient too! Especially when you bring in an indecisive teenager who goes through 20 spoons of sampling.   Reasonably priced, and the new decor is nice. Miss the old patio, though. It was nice sitting outside in the fall.   Their wood-fired pizzas are good. But can be hit or miss. Ask them for a crispy crust and it won't be undercooked and soggy like some people complain about. I like the Primavera (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Arugula, Prosciutto, Olive Oil, Shaved Grana Padano) and the Esotica (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Fresh Pineapple, Italian Ham, Basil, Tuscan Olive Oil). LOVE IT!!   If you're thinking of going on a weekend, order ahead online! It will save you time in line and the headache of waiting! Bon appetit!

Won't waste my time coming back here. With nobody around on a Sunday night, the 9:30pm showing of a movie nearly empty, we were refused tickets because I didn't have my ID to prove I was over 21. Really? I'm frickin' old enough to be your mother, kid. Was told we could see another movie on the forks side. For $30? No, thanks. AMC MAJOR FAIL! I'll just spend my money elsewhere.

I can't believe my gut doesn't hang over my pants, seriously. With all the burger joints I visit, I don't know how I don't take up two seats on a plane yet. Been visiting Fatburgers since I lived in SoCal. And way before any In N' Out was built around here.   But I digress. I can't say enough about how yummy this place is... all over the Valley. From the baseball park to Mesa, where ever there is a Fatburger, I'll surely make a visit.   Fries... super. Shakes... super d duper. Burgers... mmmm. I could eat two or three. Go forth and build the belly, folks. You won't regret it!

I wish they'd invest some money and make this a Fry's Marketplace. They don't have a great selection of items so I usually end of going to Safeway's, Albertson's or Basha's to pick up other items. But as usual in Fry's, they have super friendly employees! So five starts for them for that!

I received a Groupon gift in 2013 for a facial/rejuvenation lift. I enjoyed the service and after two years, am still seeing her regularly. She always calls a day before to confirm my appointment and sometimes again in the morning. I'm really pleased with her followup and expertise in areas of tai chi, reiki, acupuncture and holistic healing. She is a wonderful woman whom I grown extremely fond of. Bonus, her new office is even closer to me!!!

The crowd is just an amazing mix of everything you find in Mesa. From barely legal to barely breathing, you'll find it at Rooster's. Handlebar moustaches, big beer bellies, tattoos. Definitely no guidos in the crowd here, though, as the Affliction and Ed Hardy loving crowd doesn't know this place exists.   Nice little dive bar with great service, Harry Luge and his band playing a mix of country, rock, and whatever else comes up when they're not out touring, a couple pool tables and now, a good patio to throw the smokers on. Decent prices on the drinks and always a good supply of Malibu :)  The only guy candy I've ever encountered is Harry. Double yummy on the ears... and eyes. Girls, not that I like to share, but visit this place and you'll be hooked...   One word of advice... when you leave this place, make sure that you use your blinker, don't make any wide left or right turns, as there is usually a motorcycle cop just waiting to nail someone's drunk ass.

One word. STRAWBERRY!! I am addicted to them (but will never go to rehab) and can't wait for my next fix. Sometimes the frosting is a bit thick and I think I might go into sugar shock. I've tried coconut , yummy. Red velvet... blah. Overrated. Lemon, decent. But please, if Malibu Rum Barbie is saying try the Strawberry sensation, do it!!  As for parking, that's on the developer of that particular development. They had a triangular corner to work with and made the best of it. I enter through the light and park around back. My thighs appreciate the extra steps so I can indulge more often in the ritual which is Sprinkles.

Malibu Rum Barbie likes the vibe here. Yes, the pours are quite generous and the alcohol flows quickly all night. They tend to keep a good core of bartenders and bouncers here that make you wanna come back. Live music is good fun and some of the acts have gone on to bigger venues. A good sign!   Bathrooms for sexy bitches, check :)  Dance floor, check (although it could be larger :) Guy candy, check check!!

Just so you know, I don't come here for the Malibu. I've been a regular since October 2007 when they opened their doors. And their house margarita is THE absolute best I've ever had. I can't get enough of them!!  Food is awesome and if you get the chips and salsa, be prepared to eat five basketfuls. They are just that darn good.   I've also had happy hour parties and a birthday party upstairs. Great place to hang out!!!! Go there... or suffer from crappy margaritas elsewhere :)

Sorry, folks. No Malibu Rum here. I stay sober and enjoy the food when heading to City Hall.   Filet? Yes, please :) Oh, and the joy of the lobster mashed potatoes, the chocolate cake and bread basket with pretzel bread. Can you say carb overload?? You'll definitely need a good workout after dining here :)    Bar wait staff is okay at best but restaurant staff is excellent. And live music at the piano bar is nice. Although it can get a bit too loud at times in the bar and you can't hear the person next to you. Also, watch out for the Trouts, gals. Some can be pretty creepy!!!

I go for the hot chocolate on a chilly morning. My daughter loves their lattes. And we really enjoy the quaint atmosphere of a nursery in the background. A serene way to spend a morning.   Ted and Maria are absolutely fabulous hosts. Ted is a musician and every so often, they jam at the nursery. Don't miss it. Also, Maria does monthly events and fundraisers for local charities.   If you have dogs, they just started selling treats for them. Bonus!

Lived around the corner from this place for over a year. Long overdue for a visit!  We went for lunch and sat at the bar. Had a rootbeer float which was A+++++ yum!   My friend had the Italian Bee and LOVED it. Said it reminded him of the little mom and pop shops in Chi-Town and Beantown.   I had the margherita pizza which had the softest and melt in your mouth slices of tomatoes EVAH!!!   A good choice for a good, simple meal :)

Food was mediocre and the rental rates for a room to sing karaoke were pricey. It took the waitress a bit to get drinks so the buzz never really sunk in. An empty glass in a bar is a waste. Not overly generous on the booze either. Two  hours and $300 later, I was only slightly buzzed, as was my friend, so we decided to trek over to The Grapevine.

Yes... ping pong, pool, shuffleboard and darts. Although they replaced one of the dart boards with a lame video game.   Patio (which is partially enclosed) shouldn't be used for smoking but it is considered a patio. So if you don't like smoke, stay away from this area. Otherwise the booze pours generously and the place gets packed on weekends! Yes, they serve Malibu... so I can get lit while I beat the boys playing games :)

Totally disappointed here, people. Server forgot to input my order and the place wasn't even busy. I ended up getting the wrong order after a lengthy 40-minute wait. So the manager gives me a $2 coupon for my next visit. It's still sitting in my car.   Not too generous on the pours... and the Malibu Pineapple was too watery. Definitely a downer in my book :(

Pool tables. Shuffleboards. College Football games galore. And of course, plentiful pours of the Malibu Rum :) a great spot for fun times!!! And did I mention Sundays they have free pool from 7pm to close?? Wow!!! Plus Duke is from Montana. Double the star rating!!!  Bonus points for their car service when you get a bit tipsy :)

Mediocre effort by Fox. Food didn't impress me. Wait staff was "dunlapping" over her tight outfit. Not an appetizing sight people. Drinks were okay.

Who can resist antler chandeliers? Not this girl :) Intimate spot to hang out with friends, shoot a game of pool or watch the game. Outdoor patio gets a bit smoky sometimes :( Great staff but they need more, it's tough to get a drink and service sometimes!!

Awesome bartender on the patio! Way great drink specials!! Don't come here to have conversations, folks. It's LOUD!! Great DJ spinning crazy dance music. Place gets way crowded so get there early and snag a spot to people watch!!

No Malibu Rum at the beach, really?? WTF people?? When I asked for Malibu Rum I was brought that fake ripoff crap Parrot Bay. Did I ask for Parrot Bay? No, so don't freaking bring me one and try charging me for it.   I stick with the margarita pitchers here, folks. Not overly generous on the alcohol though :( and lastly, don't pay hundreds for bottle service and get stuck in a cabana with no heat!!!!  Oh, and the guy candy is hit or miss. Sometimes, A OK... other times, hard to tell everyone apart since they are all wearing the same douche bags shirts and hair gel. (No fist pump necessary)!!!

Okay, they don't have Malibu but the DO have my favorite coconut water, C2O. It's in a can and they sell it by the case. I LOVE IT!   A writer's group I belong to meets here monthly. Free Wi-Fi and large tables are definitely a plus. On cooler Phoenix evenings, they lift the door and the place is breezy and pleasant.   Try the Dirty Doctor and you might end up nursing a Luci-style sandwich hangover. The Melt has Luci's house-baked turkey, roast beef, cheddar, avocado, horseradish mayo and their signature barbecue sauce :)   Saturday is Jazz Night: haven't stopped in yet but am intrigued...  And if you get stuck for parking, try the backdoor. It's easy access :)

When Petco stopped carrying the holistic/organic food I was getting for my cats, I stumbled upon Choice Pet. So I started buying it here. Then going to Petco for other stuff, PetSmart for some other stuff and Target for cat litter. Slave to the cats.   No more. The gals at Choice Pet said to bring in a receipt and they would price match. They enter it in to your account so it's ALWAYS there. Now I get my cat litter prices from Target for World's Best and it saves me $8/bag. And you can STILL use your Choice Pet Market coupon for $10 or $20 off depending on how much you spend. I always spend over $100 so the $20 off coupon really pays off!   Also, when you have an account, returns are SOOO easy. Even without a receipt! I returned something to another store and all they did was call the store of purchase to look it up. IT WAS THAT EASY!   The service is ALWAYS wonderful and depending on who's working when I come in, they know my name and pull up my account without having to ask me. I've stopped shopping at big box Petco and PetSmart and only buy my pet items at Choice Pet.   The local store, local service and quality are A+ in my book!

I was tempted to grab a grass skirt and wiggle into Hula's for their Tiki Time Happy Hour (Monday - Friday 3:30-6pm). But I opted for the Phoenix summer staple: a sundress and flip-flops. Love the mid-century modern feel. That gets a star :)  It was around 5:30pm and it was busy, but our server came over and took our drink orders when she saw us join a friend's table. I asked for Malibu and Pineapple and my friend Zombie'd out. We were given menus and she left without clearing any plates on our table, where our friends had several (not to mention a couple empty glasses).  She came back with the Zombie and told me they didn't have Malibu (what a disgrace to Tikiville's everywhere!!) but the bartender said I wouldn't know the difference and to bring me this. She set it down. I looked at her and said, "No, thanks." AUTOMATIC MINUS TWO STARS - one for NOT having Malibu and another one for trying to pass the fake crap off.  I ordered the Surfrider Chicken Sticks and Steak Tacos while my friend ordered the Mango Chicken Caesar (someone else in our party had ordered it and enjoyed it). She didn't take our menus and all of our drink glasses were empty. A few comments were made about this.  Ten minutes later, we get the Surfrider Chicken Sticks which were SET ON TOP OF MY MENU (damn, really??). They were cold. Decent, but cold nonetheless. My friend's salad came and I was told it would be a minute for the tacos. Another 20 minutes and they still hadn't come. Not to mention my empty plate SITTING ON TOP OF A MENU, empty water glass and my friend's empty glass.  A couple friends got up to leave and their empty plates and glasses remained even after WE got our check. I was billed for the tacos but I never got them. It took another 10 minutes for her to return with a correct bill.   Awful service, cold food, no food and a fake-Malibu serving bartender give this place ONE star in my book.

Wow. My new favorite spot. The Fried Chicken is fab!! (Our server called it comfort food, hahaha!!) So is the canolli. Just make sure you tell them to ditch the mushrooms if that's not your thing. They don't tell you that on the menu!!  Great drink names, too, although I don't think some are up to my "taste" standards!! I didn't end up drinking it but hey, they have Malibu Rum so I am okay with it.   A live band plays a few days a week so tune in for that. And plan for a late night :)  I think since it just opened in January, they are working kinks out so bear with some of the service "issues." The company I've been with, the several times I've already dined there, have kept me completely engaged so I don't think I've had to wait long. If I have, oh well. Just gave me more time to enjoy the conversation and views :)

I'll admit I almost fell outta my chair after hitting a triple-double on the Malibu. Quite generous pours plus delish menu. Can't wait to go back and try out the dance floor!!! Did I mention the Disco Ball?? Yeah, baby!

Smells like a dirty ashtray and the place is new... if you head for the Orange Sky or plan a visit to Showroom or the Ballroom, there isn't any smoking allowed in those areas so you'll not reek of smoke. But unfortunately, you have to travel through smokersville to get there. I did find the parking garage in the back to be an easy way to avoid MOST of the smoke if you are heading to the Showroom or Ballroom.   Concert in the Ballroom was disappointing. The acoustics are quite absent so if you appreciate the Dodge (CoAmerica) or other real music venues, you'll be disappointed. And the bar in the Showroom is cramped when there is a large amount of people. Our private party was extremely crowded around the bar and they didn't have enough servers coming around. Empty glass hell!!! Only plus is they do have Malibu...

As a FB fan, I was offered free Skyy Vodka drinks - for me and a few of my friends - for an hour if we came in during happy hour. I said, "What the heck, why not?" and rounded up a few friends to try them out. BEWARE of this PROMOTION, it ended up being a fraud in my book and lost them two stars.  Woo's happy hour starts early (3ish) and ends at 6:30pm with specialty drinks half off and a variety of small dishes for reasonable prices.   We sampled: - fried eggrolls ($1.95) - chicken dumplings ($2.95, ordered pan-fried) - seafood dumplings ($4.75, ordered steamed) - crab puffs ($2.95) - char sui ribs ($4.95) - shrimp balls ($5.95) - Woo's fried rice ($4.95)   All the food was pretty good and arrived timely, although my pan-fried dumplings were steamed. The rice was enough for a few people. The other dishes were modest in size and good for individuals versus community sharing.  A couple of my friends tried the Yellow Fever (and it fondly reminded me of Dean doing his Eye of the Tiger gag at the end of a Supernatural episode). A couple others had Skyy vodka plain with soda and another friend grabbed a beer. Sadly, with no Malibu, I was relegated to an imposter - Barcadi Coco - in the China Mist. HINT: Malibu would've made it WAY better!  Thanks to Sheila, our server, plates were cleared and glasses refilled without us having to ask, always a plus in my book. However, when we got our $75.00 bill after an hour of eating and drinking, the Skyy drinks were INCLUDED. I asked our server about it and she removed two, but we were still charged for the other two.   I would've given our experience 3.5-4 stars but when you charge for something you CLEARLY state are comped, then take a couple off and STILL include a couple, that's just crappy. $15 bucks off of $75 wouldn't have broken the bank and we tipped $20 on top of it. So, beware of their FB promo.

First fail: no Malibu. BUSTED!   Second fail: not being able to use the empty parking lot on a Wednesday afternoon without valet parking. Really? Valet parking is used so you don't have to park a million blocks away and you pay for the convenience of having someone go run after it. Not so you can rape patrons by having them pay $8 to get out the car, drive 10 feet and park it.  Third fail: bartenders these days in Scottsdale, where DO they come from? My friend ordered a dirty martini and he didn't know what that was... mon dieu, The Mint.   And I really can't stand metro-Phoenix establishments ripping off classic L.A. names and trying to charge L.A. prices, trying to exude the hipsteriness *my word*  is a clusterf-ck of proportions.   Overall, not impressed and won't return.

When a skeezy bartender tries to slip Cruzan coconut rum into your drink without telling you they don't serve Malibu, it's a big fail in my book. I saw him do it and he wasn't even going to tell me. WTF, dude?  The big ball of fried, breaded appetizer was something I probably made in home ec 20 years ago, and should have never been let out of the kitchen. But alas, serve it they did.   I went for a mixer and the service was less than good. I guess when you tell a place you're bringing a buttload of people in, they don't prepare. The A/C was miserable, bartenders were overworked and empty drink glasses just don't cut it in my book.   Will I return? Doubtful. Too many other places that don't try to slip fake Malibu to a guest.

Purchased a Groupon for TWO spray tans. After a month of trying to schedule ONE appointment, I got a call back and they needed to reschedule me as someone didn't show up and they were overbooked. I couldn't get in for another month (which is good on their end, obvi). As I travel for work, that appointment needed to be rescheduled (by me this time). I was told my Groupon wouldn't be valid and I would need to pay the price difference. It was like a bait and switch, they were just waiting for it to expire so they didn't have to honor it. NOT COOL!

Oh it's ABSOLUTELY the correct place. I just got a notification from Groupon it never got used. What a waste of money. And you're rescheduling is why. Trying to reschedule a few weeks out when I'm not even in town is not only a hassle it put me closer to expiration. And YOUR firm wouldn't offer an extension for YOUR cancellation. NO STARS.

Will be happy to send snapshots of group in with your company name. In addition to Verizon wireless with your company number listed. Yes, please try to deny it after that. It happened. I am just now acknowledging it although I should've last summer when you screwed me over.

I'm right there with Janee. I bought another offer via kgb deals in April. They were booked a month out when I called to schedule my facial/massage combo. No problem. Made the appointment for May 4. I was called the day before our appointment and told the masseuse had  family emergency and since I was doing a combo treatment did I want to reschedule. I said that would be fine.   Little did I know how difficult it would be to reschedule. I was told I'd get a callback in a week when they could start rescheduling again. I received a call two weeks later asking if I still wanted to come in. Duh, yes. Then was told I'd get a callback to schedule something by the end of the week.   Three weeks later (six weeks since my appointment was cancelled) and I still haven't received a followup call. Left three messages on their machine. And called about a dozen more times.   I would advise folks to NOT buy any "deals" from this company until they get their ISH together.   With the crappy service BEFORE the treatment, I'm glad I'm not going. Afraid I'd get some used and tainted wax, facial towels or whatever else! SCARY!

I ventured over to the new Choice Pet Market since it's a little closer than the one on Shea I normally visit. They are a smaller store so carry a limited selection compared to some of the other stores. But they WILL have anything you need delivered from another store so it's more convenient to pick up. The service was stellar and knowledge of pet foods and toys is very good.   Choice Pet Market is my go-to staple for pet items in Phoenix. And some advice for non-frequent customers: 1. Create an account. 2. Bring in any receipts or ads for items you normally purchase elsewhere. They'll enter it in to your account and honor that price EVERY TIME.  3. Buy. Buy. Buy!   Love this "choice" from the big box mix and the variety is excellent! Also, if you're brave enough... you can see your "spend" on your account. With coupons, for the year I am at over $1500. That means I really got an additional $200 or so in free items and price matching. It has saved sooo much time. Love this place!

I've bee here a few times and gotta give the Volcano Chicken a rave review. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!   Sushi is fresh, drinks are generous. The only reason I don't give it five stars is inconsistent service. I can sit at the bar and wait 10 minutes for even a hello. And sometimes I can go in, sit at the bar and have someone within 10 seconds. Table service is spotty also when it comes to drink service and clearing plates.   But all in all, enjoyable and good food. And VOLCANO CHICKEN!!!!

From the moment we walked in, Jane made us feel like family. As first-time guests, I can guarantee we'll be regulars now. Her warm, English welcome and goodies from across the pond are quaint and welcome in Old Town.   We had a baby with us and Jane generously offered to hold her while we snacked on gelato and crepes. Positively lovely experience in itself.   The gelato comes from a nearby, local family and is simply delicious. There are plenty of crepes to select from or she'll do a custom one based on ingredients. They're made right in front of you and quite tasty.   This gem is hidden in the back of the Frontier boardwalk area on Main so don't miss out on it because if you walk on by, you'll surely miss out on a great experience.

Riding bikes past this spot into Old Town and decided to check it out. The HUGE patio outside caught our eye.   My daughter decided she wanted the A/C instead of enjoying a warm, pre-summer evening on the patio. Thankfully the A/C wasn't too cold. Chilly but not arctic (a plus in my book).   Service was prompt, friendly and helpful. We ordered hot wings for an appetizer and they were an equal mix of wings and drumsticks yay for us!! The hot was tingly hot and just right!   Our main dish was the 12" thin crust Meatless Pizza with spinach, tomatoes, red onion, bell peppers, cheese and sauce. It also includes mushroom but hellllllll no, not on my pizza.   It was cut into tiny squares which was a pleasant surprise. We throughly enjoyed. Every. Last. Bite. It was more than enough for two people and was just right.   We will definitely be back. And sit outside next time. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is the lame playlist they blast inside.
