Breakfast is awesome! I tried the 3B (buttermilk, blue cheese, bacon) pancakes the other day. Very interesting! Love all the fries! The ahi tuna sandwich or the pesto chicken sandwich are to die for...Stop over at the coffee shop next door for a cupcake.

The service at this location is lacking. They *can't* do anything you want, but say it with a smile. They *can't* seat you unless everyone is at the restaurant at the same time. They *can't* honor a Texas Roadhouse coupon from another location. They *can't* cook the kids steak bites less than well done, because they are so small. And, they *can't* cook the 6oz steak off of the kids menu less than medium well. I am over it...

They don't have the yummy ice cream anymore :(   I have tried this place 3 times. Everything I have tried is sour or salty. The house salad, the chicken salad, the bruchetta...They should take some bruchetta lessons from Postinos. I really want to like this place. The pink peppercorn homemade ice cream was the only thing I loved. Ambiance is lacking and the service is awful. Ehh.

I love TNT! The classes are suitable for all fitness levels. My favorites are Yoga and Muscle, but I plan to try the Zumba and Barre really soon. For the current class schedule go to the Facebook page.

Love the jalapeño popper grilled cheese and garlic fries! Service is great too. Only thing missing was some jalapeño jelly (or something similar) to dip my spicy sandwich.

Tried this place out because my regular place was busy. It is clean, pretty and service is great. Thanks Brandon!

I am giving high tide two stars for the Prickled Pink drink and the iced tea. They were amazing. We ordered the sampler appetizer and we couldn't eat the crab because it smelled so awful. We told our friendly server and he offered to replace them with warm crab legs. When the came out they were just as bad. When we suggested they tasted old our server insisted they were shipped in daily and were "on point". We all had to take a trip to the restroom to wash our hands because it was so smelly. The lobster mac wasn't amazing, the fish and chips were salty yet bland, the peach cole slaw looked better than it tasted. Won't be back.

Service is horrible and we were he only customers in the restaurant. Wings were average at best. Honey hot are not sweet or spicy, just salty. Don't order the house salad with balsamic dressing. It is not a $7 salad! The balsamic dressing is a weird sour cream/yogurt base. Not impressed at all.
