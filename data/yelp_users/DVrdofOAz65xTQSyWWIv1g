Used to visit the buffet as a child when this restaurant was in original location. Now fast forward many moons, and brought my child for a valentine dinner.  The restaurant was not busy, maybe 20 guests; however the service was horrible. Mostly the staff was seen having conversations rather than tending to guests. Forgetting to fill up waters, table was left un-bussed as the next courses arrived.   Food was mediocre, cold rice with hardened naan. Flavors of dishes: Chicken Vindaloo, Shahi Paneer, Veg Samosa, Malai Kofta, Tadka Daal were lacking in both depth and interest.   Definitely not worth returning soon to pay for the over-priced menu based simply on location.

So ... we came in craving a delicious Pizookie.  Mind you we had been talking about getting one for the last three hours!!  What a disappointment it was to be hosted by one of the most inattentive servers in my dining experience.  Couldn't tell you his name because he never introduced himself.  Took our drink and dessert order and came back only once to check on us.  We had to guess what the bill was and leave some cash on the table because he never came back to drop off the check.  In his defense, he was pretty busy with all of his other tables who were looked more promising of a bigger tab!  So, we enjoyed our Pizookie without any napkins (and with a toddler, this was a bit of challenge).  Just some thoughts about our experience tonight, think I will continue to get my Pizookie at Zipps Sports bar and grill where the skillet is bigger, and they actually notice customers sitting at the table.

Granted it's been about 10 years since I came here last, sad to see that the food quality has depleted!  Charging for a second serving of chips or any salsa with entrees. Rice was dry as well as the tamale. Could've have just gotten some at the store and microwaved it myself. Apparently they also charge extra for water because they weren't refilled once during our meal. So disappointed that a landmark such as this has lot it's authentic value.

Treated by a dear friend for lunch, I was a bit nervous at fist glance about the menu.  My doubts were instantly set aside from the minute I took the first bite of the house salad or was it the first sip of the honey tea.  Needless to say simply delicious!!    The tapas short ribs are eloquent, a must try!!  Will definitely be coming back.  Building itself needs some TLC, especially the bathroom.

I simply can't say enough to about how wonderful my experience was!  I came in crying in pain and even though my pain didn't subside (due to a budging disc), Don was so patient and sympathetic!  Definitely a customer for life!

This is yet another over hyped and over priced Scottsdale eatery.   Went in today around 4pm with no reservations, we were seated right away and luckily by the kitchen. I say luckily because the line manger who our primary server.  Either we came during a shift change or there was serious confusion about who our server because he/she was hard to track and changed during our early dinner. No introduction, just a different person. Thank goodness being by the front, we were able to request assistance from the hostess stand as well.   Trust me, we were not needy ... Just wanted some water and a spoon.    The food was mediocre; I have had more flavorful food through a mom and pop drive thru.   I will drive 10 miles for good Mexican cuisine and am definitely going avoid coming to SOL if I am in need of a Salsa and taco fix.  I am all for combining flavors and creating delicious fusion cuisine; however, at these prices keep the water glasses filled, check in with your table and when bussing ... Keep the crumbs off your guests' laps.

Hummus Xpress catered a friends birthday party and w/in two days, we are on site.   I am impressed by their build your own Mediterranean cuisine concept. The food is delicious, as if cooked fresh rather than under a hot plate on a line.   The employees were really accommodating and satisfied our hungry and indecisive tummies.  And whoa nelly ... they aren't kidding when they say spicy ... My flavor buds are still salivating at the fresh flavors!  Now if only they had a location closer to Scottsdale (hint hint)
