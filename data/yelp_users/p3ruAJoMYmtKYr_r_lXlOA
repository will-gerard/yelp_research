This is a small business where you get a good sandwich for a good price. The quality of the meat leaves something to be desired, but overall for a quick bite for cheap it is a good alternative to subway. These are sandwiches you can make yourself, but don't because your lazy. The owner is a good guy who offered to wrap our leftovers for us, so they get bumped up to 4 stars for that. Go here if you want subway but not subway.

Have you ever had to wait 30 minutes in the drive through? Neither had I until I went to this hell hole. The obese woman who takes your money had a look of emptiness in her eyes as if she knows her life has peaked. I'm sure the cook was sleeping or getting high in the bathroom while I was waiting for my order of one burrito with two cars in front of me. I can't believe it took literally 30 minutes from when I drove up to when I was given my receipt and not even thanked for paying them to give me diarrhea. Screw that.

Your hotdog might take a bit, and it's nothing you can't do yourself on a grill, but this place is a cut above the rest in the hotdog arena. Not too expensive and you can pick all your options like subway or chipotle. A solid choice for a sub $5 quick bite.

I purchased a used bedroom set that had one of the trim pieces missing from a drawer. I took the drawer here and after my experience there is nowhere else I would bring furniture for repairs. Ed at Guardsman knows more about wood and furniture than any living person on the planet. He was not only able to match the type of wood, but he custom made a stain to match my furniture. I mentioned that the bed had a scuff mark as well, and Ed threw in some stain for me to take home. They really go above and beyond for their customers! 10/10 would use again!

A great little breakfast place close to asu. Don't be intimidated by the shady exterior. Commit and get a good drunk recovery meal!

Get the green curry and don't look back. It's a strong move. I love how healthy this place can be and the food is not processed. I feel like this is how home cooking would be if my mom was Asian. A little expensive though.

You get the same burrito at every filibertos. The drive through man would only give me 2 sauces when I asked for 4. I was sitting at the open window and he just pretended like he couldn't speak English. Lies.

I called to make an appointment for an x ray and was told to walk in. I waited for over an hour before I was seen. Are you freaking kidding me? That was the whole point of my call. I will never go here again.

Amazing food at large portions. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for. Pretty much whatever you get will be good. They have the best breakfast burrito I have ever had!
