I have been to the Compass Grill several times before...the views are amazing and the food in the past has been just ok.  However, this time I had the salmon and a wedge salad and both were prepared very well.  I am a realtor who deals with lots of out of town buyers and always recommending places to eat to clients.  Originally had tried to get in on Saturday night but they were booked till 8:00 so agreed to do Sunday.  When we arrived hostess tried to sit us in table and not in booth as we requested when I said I would wait they seamed a little put off by this...even though there were numerous booths available she said she would have to clean it and it would be about 10 minutes...I agreed this was OK and just thought it was not like they were packed and should be more accommodating when there were more seats available.  Might want to rethink your seating on slower nights as they tried to get another couple after us to sit right next to us and they declined as well wanting a more desirable table.

Maggiano's is one of my favorite North Scottsdale restaurants.  I love the Salmon Oscar and all the waiters & waitress are terrific!  Our favorite being Jean,  My concern is not so much the food as it the wait...  We go about twice a month and have noticed now that the winter visitors are back in town even with reservation we were told it would be another 30 minute wait after our reservation time...Thank goodness a nice manager from Denver just happen to be there and immediately got us a table after the hostess had told several other customers with reservations the same thing!  I explain to the manager that we come in the summer when we are always able to get right in but to "BUMP" us for 30 minutes past are reservation time in busy winter months just does not make good business since.  I also felt sorry for another couple who told us they were told 30 minute wait then after 30 minutes were told another 30 minutes.    Please don't bump your local year round clients for the drop ins from out of town...My suggestion would be to either hire more staff & open upper level, or  keep your customers that do make reservation to a 10 minute delay at the most...even if some tables are empty for 10 minutes.  You will want us in July...keep us happy now!   YOU HAVE  GREAT FOOD,  I just know we meet several customers who were just as upset as us about making reservations and being told we still had to wait another 30 minutes...  Shout out to the manager from Denver who was there to resolve issue!

Ok...I have been to the Ocean Club in the past and had great food...but this last Saturday night was the WORST!!  First off, the table they wanted to set us at was right by the waiters door...  Yes, we had reservations and still this is where they wanted us to sit!  OK...I understand the out of towner's are here, but us locals who dine out at least twice a week year round keep you open when it is 110 outside.   They did seat us at another table after we refused to sit by the door; but were reluctant even though there were 3 tables with reserved signs but no one sitting at them nor did anyone sit at for 15 minutes after us.  The waiter was nice and recommended a Grouper with bearnaise sauce; sounded good right?  Just let me say it was chewy and the sauce was not as good as the packet version you can buy in the store for a BUCK!  OK maybe it was just me???  Wrong my friends dish was just as bad...a runny watered down lemon sauce more like lemon aid with sole fish swimming in the water down sauce.  I don't want to sound negative but Eddie V's fish taco's for $18 dollars or their Chilean Sea Bass are much better and you don't mind spending &45.00 for it.  I took my fish home and even my dog turned his nose up at it!    On a nice note...the pretzel bread is good.

After having a bad nail job at The Summit, I went here to get redone!  Night & Day experience.  Everyone very happy and pleasant,  Vivian was new and did a wonderful job on my toes and Tammy redid a bad nail job I had a week earlier.  Both were wonderful and took their time even though we were last customer of the night.  The salon is very clean and updated...I would highly recommend to anyone who is picky about their mani/pedicures.

Who says AZ is not pretty has not been to this area...great for a bike ride and you can do an all day ride and stop by one of many restaurants in area.

This is a sad story of a restaurant that when first open had great food, service and prices.  Unfortunately, I have seen the prices go up and everything else go down hill.  I hadn't been there in some time because I was not impressed with the last few times I had been.  But, as someone who goes out to dinner several times a week, I thought I would give it a try.  I ordered the salmon and could not believe what a small portion it was, but even sadder was when you flipped it over it was char BLACK on one side!!!  The waiter did take it back but it should have never been served and how awkward is it for the other people at the table to eat their food???  Don't think they will see me again!

I am a realtor and have use this company not only for myself but have clients who have used them as well.  The nice thing is you can buy your tank and install it yourself or have handyman do it as well.  Hot water tanks are a common problem in the valley because of our hard water here they tend to need to be replaced every 8 to 10 years.  BEST PRICES I HAVE SEEN!

Just happen to be going for a show and decided to reserve table at Orange Sky.  I had been there several times before to sit in one of the private booths overlooking the city which I highly recommend especially for special occasions.  This time however ate out in main area...Christopher was our waiter and he did a great job serving us.  I usually have fish, but Christopher recommended the fillet and boy was I glad he did!!!  It was way better than the steak I had only a few weekends ago at Dominick's Steak house and about half the price.  This steak melt in your mouth...  I am a local Realtor in town and clients always ask me where to go...now I will replace Dominick's with Orange Sky.  Two thumbs up for Christopher as well, we will request  you in near future as I am already thinking about how good it was!!!

Eddie V's Happy hour is the best!  Try the Lobster Taco's or the Ahi Tuna.  I am a realtor and refer all my out of town clients here and they always love it!

Ok Dominicks,  I see your manager does read the reviews on here as they were nice enough to contact me and ask for a "DO OVER"  and yes it put you back on my list of great Steak Houses!  I am in the people business too and I know sometimes things happen and the only thing you can do is try to earn that business back and I commend you for doing so.  I had the Fillet and not the Ribeye this time and it was great.  Will recommend you to my new out of town clients again.  The pork belly was yummy as well for all you meat lovers!

Wow, what can I say...thought I was just going to a neighborhood restaurant but was really taken back by the decor and how busy they were for a Wednesday night.  This is a word of mouth local hot spot anyone in the area will appreciate.  The special of the night was Sea Bass...at an Italian place???  Hmmm...well the waiter said I would not be disappointed and I have to say it was a close runner up to Eddie V's Sea Bass and about 1/2 the price.  I think this is the best new cafe in North Scottsdale and has the feel of a 5 star restaurant without the high price tag.  Great place to din outdoors for you out of state snow birds as well.  As a local Realtor I will recommend to my out of state clients looking for the local hot spot and not a chain restaurant they can eat at anywhere.  The owner is from Canada and now resides here and was great at checking with all his guest about their experience...It's nice to have someone who truly cares about your feedback.  This is a phenomenal spot for us to have in North Scottsdale.

Came here when first open up and keep coming back.  The service is getting better and better think they just had growing pains.  Our server was great this last time I think his name was Alex...sorry if I am wrong.  He did a terrific job and new menu better than previous serves will ask for him again, hopefully I have correct name!  The salmon is my favorite, but I will try sea Bass in future!
