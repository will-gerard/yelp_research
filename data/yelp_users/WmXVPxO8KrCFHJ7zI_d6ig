frankly i am disappointed. Service  was painfully  slow. She was very nice but i guess she was very busy.  Food was ok. Wife ordered eggplant rotini and the outside was hot inside was cold gnocchi was not good.  Shrimp scampi was  good.  Everything  else  was average

Probably the fourth time I have gone to this Yard House. Service continues to be excellent.  Our server was Alex and he was great and completely knowledgeable in the menu and more importantly could rattle off about 90% of the beer selection.  I had the beef dip and a cup of chowder.  All good stuff.   The menu has a great variety I options so it has a broad appeal.   Really though. It's about the service.  Lots of good people.

Came for a birthday party and the place  was packed.  Service was very good even under convusing circumstances. Lacey was our server and did a great job. The whole staff was good too because i had an empty  glass as another sever walked by and asked if i needed something.    DJ was great.  A good mix of music. Food was geat we did an appy and salad and they were very good...the place is just a good time!
