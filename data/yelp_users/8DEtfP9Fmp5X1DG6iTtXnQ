Douglas W. has it right.  You're basically on a mini-vacation when visiting Estancia, from the amazingly immaculate greens, breathtaking scenery of both Pinnicle Peak and the Valley, to the beautiful homes that line the course.  The course itself is quite diverse - one of my particular favorites is teeing off atop a 20-30 foot boulder and to have my ball sail across the wash below, complete with rugged steps to the top.

Always seem to stumble upon Kazimierz while wandering Old Town looking for a good place for live music.  I have never been disappointed here.    I've had a few things on the menu - namely the pretzel bite appetizer with mustard(?) jam, various cheese plates, and street tacos.  All are quite good at a reasonable price.

Attended the Table 12 Lunch & Learn event with guest Chef Mel Mecinas and was truly blown away.  I have previously eaten off of the house menu, so was expecting just as spectacular presentation as Chef Beau Macmillan presents - I was not disappointed.  Our party started the night at Jade, which I have written a review for previously.  Great place, wont go into much detail there.  The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna, bacon, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce.  Second course was Korean short ribs, brussel spouts, and lotus root kimchi.  For dessert, twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts.  The meal could not have been more amazing, and the service was just as good.  Have already booked the event on Aug 18.

Neighborhood bar I frequent often.  Best wings - teriyaki wings well done...they're so addicting.  Atmosphere is good, love hitting up ping pong or bag toss.

Went for a 15 person birthday party.  We had a small room reserved off to the side of the main dining room with a dedicated and attentive staff which was johnny-on-the-spot with everything that we needed.  Some of us started with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which were a mixture of chicken, peanuts, candied cherries(?), and other deliciousness.  These are truly good and a good value.  For the entree I had the Pork Chile Mac & Cheese, which was ok.  I was hoping for more pork chile flavor and less a big bowl of mac & cheese with some pork here and there.  Unfortunately it was the later.

$2 taco Tuesdays: Pork adovada Tinga chicken Carne asada Dos equis battered tilapia Grilled veggie  The lettuce wraps are simply irresistable.  I know I mentioned it in my last review...but they are worth bringing up again.  GET THESE.  Macadamia nuts, dried peaches, chicken, pumpkin seeds, etc, a tangy and sweet taste on crisp romaine lettuce.  Makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  Serving size is large.  I've also had the blue cheese wedge salad, and just the half-salad is sufficient for me.  Don't skimp, get the bacon add-on.  It's gloriously crispy and adds the perfect zing to this tasty entree.

Bad seafood, bland flavors and food drenched in oil.  A couple years ago this was the go-to place for great Chinese food, and as much crab legs as you could fit into your stomach.  We went on a weekday, where possibly the dishes had been sitting since lunch.  Staff was attentive and helpful.

Went on a Thursday for HH and pre-game before a comedy show down the street.  Place was hoppin, and rightfully so.  The ambiance is lively yet casual and laid back.  Folks were trendy, boys in their new bright muscle shirts fisting a sake bomb, ladies sporting the newest Scottsdale chic dress sipping a house special cocktail.  Staff was attentive, though a bit overworked.  The food and drinks were a little slow getting to the table, but they were worth the wait.  We had quite the sampling of sushi, appetizers, and sake.  What a combo!

A no non-sense eatery...you get your Greek on and feel great afterwards.  My usual is the traditional, nothing special but always delicious.  I almost always get things to go as the place is normally sweltering hot, decorated with crazy random and old posters of the Mediterranean, but the food more than makes up for it.

Overall pretty good.  Pho, great.  Beef with rice, awesome.  Iced coffee, worth the trip just for this.     Staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will be back.

The first time we stopped in for dinner, having just finished our salads, a fire broke out in the kitchen and they were forced to close for the night per the fire department.  Our second time back was just as unsatisfactory.  I had the ribeye and he had the salmon - it was only ok in terms of flavor, we both found hair in our dishes.  The house salad is good though.  Our waiter was pushy, constantly wanting us to get wine or beverage from the bar or get a more expensive entree.  Once we made our $80 order, which I'm now assuming wasn't enough for his time, he was nowhere to be found.  The table next to us had similar complaints.

Great atmosphere, even better drinks and service.  The staff was courteous and attentive, offered great suggestions for a novice tequila drinker like myself.  Though I didn't order food, my party had nothing but good to say about the food.  Wouldn't mind staying in hotel afterwards, the pool looks absolutely fab.

I never knew this yogurt thing was such a fad until someone pointed out all the shops popping up around my neighborhood.  So I decided to give this one a shot, and boy was I missing out!  I've been here a few times and things are always clean, fixin's fresh and appealing, and cold yogurt tastes soooo good on a 110 degree day!

My partner and I went to return a tea pot we bought and to get some additional tea supplies. Even though we were there for a return, Julia was still helpful and attentive, answered all our questions about the various teas, it was an overall great experience.  The prices may be a little higher, but it's worth it for the outstanding customer service.

I don't often make it to this part of town, but now that I've tried Thai E-San, that just might change.  Friendly staff, great food, and a calming atmosphere give this restaurant an A in my book.  Myself and two other friends enjoyed a few dishes, as we were told most were meant to be shared.  What was selected: Lemon Grass soup with Chicken, Fish, and Squid; Yellow Chicken Curry; and Chicken Pad Thai.  The Lemon Grass soup was just what was expected, deliciously tangy with some nice heat.  Tender fish, chicken, and squid was portioned liberally and melted in my mouth.  The Yellow Chicken Curry and Pad Thai were pretty standard, though definitely not a disappointment.  Everything was excellent, though I have a feeling if it wasn't, the chef would have corrected it for us.  She was very helpful, even came out to make sure everything was to our standard.  I will be back.

Impromptu stop for a late lunch - sat outside on the patio with the busy Scottsdale Road traffic and pedestrians to watch.  It's a good thing we had some entertainment because the food was a little slow considering there were only a few people there.  I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which came with garlic aioli sauce, red pepper topping, and a pesto base.  it was very tasty, would order again.  I also ordered a filthy martini, which is billed as a dirty martini and blue cheese filled olives - with so much olive juice it's filthy!  Strong, but a slight disappointment as only one of three olives were actually filled with blue cheese.

So this is my local coffee shop.  There's something about this place, leaving the busy street outside to the absolutely chill vibe of Echo...maybe its just the thought that I'm about to enjoy some primo coffee.  When I read Rachel's review of the place, it was almost deja vu, as I asked something similar, "What kind of milk do you have."  What followed was a list of possibly every milk possible, which caught me off guard and ended up just getting it black.  When I get flustered, who knows what to expect.  There's always a good mix of people here, varying ages, but its always quiet enough to get work done, but not too quiet to seem weird.

I enjoy shopping here midday, when I'm nearly the only person in the store and I feel I have first dibbs on the newly reduced goodies at the end of the refrigerated section.  Staff is always helpful, clientele is typically young professionals on-the-go.

I have been to this location many times, as Anderson's 5th Estate, Forbidden, and now, Stand-up, Scottsdale!  The building is naturally tailored to stand up, and the Wednesday show that I went to was everything it should be.  The show started with the first of three hosts, which confused everyone except for the person who thought having this many hosts was a good idea.  Other than that, the show was well put together, ranging from new comics trying things out, to veterans who left the crowd in tears.  I would highly recommend this place, for Wednesday nights.  Free, great drink and food specials (cheese fries are amazing), and some awesome comedy.

Not to be confused by the George's Gyros on Mckellips and Miller.  This location is definitely a bar above that one.  The restaurant itself is very clean, air conditioned, and pleasant to be inside.  TV's are present to keep you entertained while you dine-in, or wait for your take-out order.  It was a little hard to find, as it's on the backside of Papago Plaza, I didn't even know this place was there until I found myself lost, and starving.  The food is pretty standard Greek food.  Delicious gyros, greek salad, etc., more often than not delivered by a Greek god of an owner.  It's nearly worth going to this place just to see him.

I arrived 25 mins early for my reservation to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail as I usually like to scope out the place before enjoying dinner.  My Manhattan was made quickly, precisely to my request, with the utmost attention to detail.  I pay attention to the small things; even the weight of the glass felt good in my hand.  I didn't mind my party was 20 minutes late, the live music was pleasant and the Scottsdale scenery was better than it normally is - after all, proper attire is required per the sign posted out front.  Once seated and our cocktail order put in, or waiter explained the menu to us - at length.  Agreed we had not been there before, but do I need every item explained to me?  That aside, my mouth was watering from all the delicious choices!  Our table ordered the salmon both ways (comes either breaded and fried, or butter/oil braised0, the filet, and Idaho Trout.  Sides included asparagus and scalloped potatoes.   The trout came only one way, breaded, and was delicious.  I can't say I was a fan of the sauce, a ranch/mayo like dressing that was too tangy and heavy for the mild and succulent 12oz trout.  The filet was everything one envisions a steak to be - sizzling, dripping with goodness.  Ordered medium, of course, the filet was the perfect amount of red in the middle.  I preferred the breaded salmon over the braised.  Slimy may not be an appropriate word, but the braised salmon was too oily which affected the texture.  Breaded is definitely the way to go.  Oh, and the dessert.  We had both the chocolate and banana fosters cakes, which were divine.  It was a dark chocolate lava cake with the best of liquid chocolate in the middle; while the banana fosters cake had a brown sugar, creme, sliced banana filling that was completely unreal.  So good there was nothing left.

$34 for a 15 minute pedicure was a little on the steep and quick side, but the mango water they served us was delicious. Also a beautiful and calming location.

Went there with my partner, was going to go to the Chipotle next door but this place had just opened up.  The pizza, pasta, and salad are all the same price - and assumable the same size - so we got two pizzas and a salad thinking we'd share the salad and have more than enough pizza to bring home as leftovers.  The pizza ordering experience is similar to ones we'd had in Vegas, basically choose your crust type, sauce, cheese, meat, veggie / other topping.  It's the same process for the salad and pasta, same sauce / veggie / other toppings as the pizza.  The pizza itself is quite good. The crust has a unique and delicious flavor that, in and of itself, would be worth coming here.  The toppings and cheese are fresh and delicious.  The salad, on the other hand, at the same cost as a pizza, is ridiculous.  It's a small side salad at best, even adding a number of toppings.  Although, again, the veggies are fresh and delicious, it's 10 bites at best.  Considering this isn't a side, but something someone would order as their entree, paying $8 for this just isn't justified remotely and almost ruins the whole experience.  The ambiance is quaint, nicely designed, until you realize an entire wall is dedicated to showing their awesome social media postings with flashing LED strips.  So basically think 4 or 5 TVs, each devoted to one social media outlet, with rolling positive reviews raving about the pizza.  When you step back and look at everything, this part of the restaurant is clearly out of place.  I don't need to be force-fed a restaurant's positive reviews while attempting to enjoy the food.
