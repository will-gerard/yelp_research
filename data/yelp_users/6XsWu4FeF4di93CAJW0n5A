Very good food.  Good service, even when busy.  Their own microbrews.  What's not to like?

This place was just fine, as far as optometrists go.  The receptionists and assistants were friendly, and the Dr was nice.  In and out promptly with a prescription for only my $20 co-pay.  No insurance hassle, or up-sell for glasses at Lenscrafters.

Will not be coming back.  Drinks tasted weak. Very weak.

Yupha's is the best Thai I've ever had.  The food is delicious, portions are decent, and spice is well controlled (from mild to triple Thai hot).  Lunch is busy and crowded, and service may be a bit slow. The food always makes up for it.

My kids had an absolute blast here.  There's a big glass window between the customer area and the cutting area, and the butcher in the back continually threw scraps of meat at the window.  They would stick, and my kids would laugh hysterically.  Alright, my kids aren't like other kids.  But the steaks (cut to order) and bacon cooked up wonderfully.  By far, the most fun I've ever had at a butcher shop.

The food was delicious and healthy.  Every item is less than 475 calories, but my wife and I were both still content after dining. Atmosphere is upscale; prices are high but not unreasonable ($15/person/lunch).   Overall, it was a wonderful experience that we'll be enjoying again.

Had one of my all time favorite dining experiences here.  My sweetie and I sat at the kitchen table, had great drinks, and shared a delicious pizza. We split a tasty dessert, and we're surprised with complimentary Limoncello shots.   Left tipsy, satisfied and delighted. On par with 4 star places that cost 3x as much.

Best waxing experience I've ever had.  My tech Janelle obviously takes pride in her work.  She went over how she would shape my brows before she started, and gave good advice tailored to my complex face.
