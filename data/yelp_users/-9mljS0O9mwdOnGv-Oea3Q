Why do we stop here and eat? It's cheap, It's fast, the name is familiar? Probably one or all those reasons. But we could be so much kinder to our digestive track if we would just explore out side the box! I once went 15 years without eating at a Taco Bell. Why did I try it again? Must have been an advertisement over powered me. I can be strong again and refuse to eat this crap once again or forever.

I like this IHOP because the team of people are great that work there. Service is good and quick. If your waitperson is busy and you ask another for something they get it for you without the excuse"I'll find your server". I have gone on a busy Saturday morning and a not so busy Saturday evening and my servers have both had personality and professionalism.   The food is pretty good. So kudos to the kitchen staff also. The place is always clean and neat no matter how busy. The location is prime, close to business, hotels and residential areas plus just a short walk from the light rail. It's also open 24 hours.

just grabbed lunch there today. Had the all white meat Teriyaki bowl. It is dry and flavorless. Is it really chicken? Turkey or pigeon I think, well at least it's some bird flesh from what I can tell by looks. Sauce is flat and lacks flavor. No thrills about a bowl with a little rice and a large portion of meat. No garnish nothing. Brought it home and fed it to my dog. She enjoyed it. I want be returning and I'm disappointed that all of you think it's so great, the place doesn't even have atmosphere to like.

I went to the Phoenix Hard Rock Cafe for lunch on a Friday. It wasn't very busy, so I figured I would sit at the bar. The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly.   But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa!   My other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm!   I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously.   It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation.  It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals!   So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee's food is much, much better and not as expensive! To Applebee's I'll return but to the HRC, this is my last visit.   Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback, if I remember the street correctly. The building & bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too, I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area.   Before this stop at the HRC, I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well. But just as the music we call Rock has deteriorated so has this conglomeration! So long fair well HRC, I withdraw my support of you.

I like pizza. I don't eat it often though. I like to get away from the chain food producers in many cases and find independent local businesses for pizza generally no matter where ever I live. However no one does a Pan Pizza like Pizza Hut! So I often crave the Pan Pizza crust Supreme Pizza and when I go for one or have one delivered, I am never disappointed. The crust is always consistent as are the multiple toppings I so enjoy. And i so appreciate that about Pizza Hut, which I can't say the same of other national pizza chains.

I love to eat here. Breakfast lunch dinner or late night. My favorite is the dbl Whataburger with cheese, grilled onions, the works with the Onion Rings and a root-beer.    I like the breakfast also and the chicken strips.  Fries are good here also.  Order is always right!  It cost a litle more to eat here but I think it is so worth it.  Generally spend $9 to $11 per adult.

This is a place that really helps a lot of women across the valley find direction and help during transitions in life. Whether you are new to the valley as I am or a long time resident they openly receive you and assist you.  They offer short term programs to assist with finding resources for counseling, education, car repairs & transportation, interviewing, networking, resume writing, self esteem & empowerment, divorce workshops, housing, entering & returning to the workplace, the list goes on.  They provide a clean, quiet & safe environment with some free daycare while using the resources at the location for all women, so as to minimize their worries and assist with getting them stabilized in the communities.  It is the best such program, I have seen in any city and a beautiful environment as well.

I was a fan of the Dirty Drummer over in Tempe back during college years at ASU. So when I walked in this location I was happy to see the faithful ASU Banner up near the bar!   The waitress was really friendly she greeted me promptly and asked what she could get me as if I was a regular. I asked if they still did hot wings and she said why of course 12 for $5. So I ordered them and a cold draft and set back to watch the NFL game in progress.   The game didn't go my way but the wings came out just perfect as they always have! Hot & crispy with just enough sauce to give them a little bite and not loose the crispiness of the big juicy wings.   The beer was cold and the shoot of Tequila I had was ample to say the least. Only they don't stock my friend Jose' ...What's up with that so I had some off brand I never heard of call Tres Amigos. It was chilled to the right temperature and slid down easy.   Can't wait to visit on a Tuesday for that burger special now.  See ya there?

Well if you think this is Authentic and great food the Mexican cooks you know aren't very good. I went with Authentic Mexican friends and none were impressed by the food. I called it mediocre and they called it less than. To me it reminded me of Home EC, Mexican food cooking lessons of the inexperienced Jr High Student. Oh, but wait... they don't teach Home EC anymore! So grading this meal (dinner) would be difficult. At least the waitress had a cool air about her that said I don't eat much of anything here, so you can't hold my opinion up to any of this feed. That's right feed not food.  Furthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking. Sitting there reminded me of a pass life experience of eating and waiting at a bus terminal.

OK I hated it! I have eaten Mexican food all across North America and this is by far the worst! Seriously I would prefer to eat at Taco Bell than return here!   The building is all they have going for them.   Service is mediocre. If you read the menu you will see at the bottom that they will not split checks for a table and a few other will not rules! Come on people, how tacky and inhospitable can a eatery be!? My waitress was some young girl. She was okay but obviously not to experienced.   My food, left me dumb founded! I was having lunch. I ordered the steak fajita $11. It was a big meal with rice, beans, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, the fajita had lots of colorful peppers w/ onions and mushrooms! Never have I had mushrooms in a meat fajita, but okay I'll go with it. Then I bit into something that set my mouth a blaze! But beyond all that the food was SALTY! Yes the rice and beans as well! I could not eat it. I set there contemplating my hunger, what set before on the plates and the girth of my waist size, or to doggy bag it for my hound - I was ready to walk away when the waitress showed up and noticed my plate. When presented with the idea of a to go box, I broke down and told her it was to salty. She kindly offered to get me something else. Off the top of my head I said a chicken enchilada. It came out, and it was even worst! When asked if it was to my pleasing, I told a bold face lie! I said it was better, only meaning it was not as salty. Then I asked for a small sour cream, to cover the taste up in an attempt to make it look like I had eaten more of it then I intended. I picked at it but left more than half of it on the plate along with the sour cream (2 Tablespoons) that they charged me $2 for!  I wanted a Sangria but opt not to attempt that recipe after experiencing the kitchen's recipes. Besides $7 for a glass of Sangria was a bit steep in my mind as well.   If you know me, you will soon learn I love a happy hour. I read their happy hour brochure and was not impressed. Basically half price on chips & two different dips and $5 drink specials. I'll pass on this as well.   Wild horses, horny handsome straight men, nor hunger or thirst will get me to return to Ajo Al's or recommend it.   Oh and it's not cheap for lunch nor dinner either, considering it's Mexican food and awful. Sure glad my Uncle Al could cook better than this.

I have to agree with the others, it's not much but a high priced ice cream stop. The concept was good when it first arrived on the blockmany years ago, but now I wonder why people keep returning. This was my 1st or maybe my 2nd visit to the Creamery, I think I went decades ago to the first one on Mill Ave.   However for the $6 I spent on a medium scoop with mix-ins I am not impressed. The coupons given to me I will pass along to some friends' kids who may or may not ever use them.

This is what I call a real dive bar. And truth be told I like to find a hole in the wall or dive bar to sometimes escape to. Yet I'm certain this one has probably seen better days.   The bartenders are nice folks, the regulars I met were pleasant people and even friendly. The well liquor is rather bad, so I guess that makes the happy hour prices fair $2.50 for well drinks & $2 for beer.   They serve food but I didn't try anything. Overheard they were having some cooler problems so I decided to pass. Most of what is on the menu will set you back about $8 bucks. But I saw that their burgers are hand formed not the frozen pressed blocks of beef so they might be as good as some people report.  They have really nice TVs and a few of them if you wish to watch something.   But even though I want to like the place for being a dive bar steps from Camelback Road and holding on, truth is I have been to better dive bars with better menus and well drinks. Hang in there Harvey's.

OK I might be picky. But when a party of four goes to a steakhouse I expect to see steaks on the tables. But these steak prices are nuts for a casual dinner spot, as were the The four plates on the table all together consisted of less than 18 oz of beef. Pretty sad for a steakhouse if you ask me.   But I will say this for the place. The staff and management was nice except for the one waiter lacking manners and reaching over me and across my plate to hand off condiments to my dining partner.   The staff is quick to refill your glasses. Friendly and otherwise thoughtful.  I might not come there for a meal again but I would consider it a decent place for appetizers and drinks. So the Saloon might just become a favorite watering hole for me from time to time.

After constantly passing the Armadillo Grill I started to wonder was it any good? So I read my fellow yelpers reviews. I was impressed with so many positive comments! I decided to go in and try it on a Wednesday afternoon. The place is pretty cool with a nice patio. The well drinks $3 not bad at all. The bartender a friendly gal name Kerri, that afternoon, who asks your name and introduces herself with confidence. The Dillo Burger and Fries I chose, was awesome! Burger was tasty, juice and fresh cooked to a perfect Medium as requested and steak fries were cooked to the perfect crispness.  Oh yeah I'll be returning! Trying to keep myself away as I write this an it approaches happy hour now when appetizers go to half price and drinks get even cheaper, and well it is Friday!  The only thing I don't like about the place is the number of TV screens with the off track betting results. Also the TVs are placed just a bit to high up for shorty here also.

Ok I like Pizza but I don't eat it often because a whole pie in a single girl's household, well ends up being consumed for breakfast, lunch and dinner and settles onto her' azzie' in record speed. Yeah I'm no twig by far and I like food, actually I love good food. Anyway my NY friends & kids rave this is the best pizza ,so I go give it a try. Hey what can I say I ordered two different slices and ate them both! It was awesome pizza much to my surprise, since these kids eat frozen pizza, and I'm skeptical that any pizza served by the slice and individually topped can be palatable. Ok I admit I'm wrong! I'm stuck up about these things. NYPD has great pizza I can walk in order two slices however I want them, not go broke and not eat pizza for an endless number of meals and wear it my thighs and my azzie for the next month or two! I'm happy.

The line moved fast. The food looked fresh. The menu is ample. The child menu is short and fare priced. The sandwiches are a lot better priced than Chompies. I had the honey-baked-ham sandwich. I know it's a Jewish deli for the most part but if you offer it make it good okay. It was alright. the ham was thin sliced and tasty, the bun however was not so good and the lettuce not so crisp. My friend had a chef salad and well it did not look very fresh either, the cheese was sort of melting back together though it had cute little cut out shapes. The lettuce not so crisp once again. The child with us seemed to enjoy the kid serving of Mac and cheese and was able to finish it. So the portion size was good for a 6 yo.  I did notice that a lot of people seemed to not eat all or any of the bread or bun their meal was on so though I'm picky, it appears to be a fair assessment that there is an issue with all the bread other than the rye.  Oh and the fact that a kids meal comes with soda is an issue, you have to pay more to give your kid a milk! That astonished me. So much for healthy America. Kid's meal comes with a cookie, French fries (yes with mac & cheese) and pop. I feel the children getting fatter reading the menu. So this Saturday lunch snatched $25 from us for a Chef salad from like two days ago, a ham sandwich on 2 day old bread and a fatten up you child kid's meal with milk and one adult small soda. Would have had a better sandwich and salad at Subway for a lot less. But I suppose if you try something else on the menu it might be worth the visit.

Recently found a Keegan's Grill in the neigborhood. Some say it's a chain restuarant . I don't know but it doesn't feel like one nor does the menu.  I went to happy hour today and had nachoes for $4 and could not finish them. They were so good yet very simple. The flour tortilla chips they make and use are awesome. They are light and crunchy and tasty and take nachoes with cheese to a new level! Even with Salsa they are great  I also sampled the hot artichoke dip with one of these chips also and found it to be very good also.  Bartender Mellisa does a good job fixing everyone drinks and recognizing the regulars.  also they offer two happy hours a 3pm - 6:30 pm and a night one also.

It's small crowded and hard to navigate. Not everything has a price tag that is easy to spot. They have some nice pieces , however the place has no personality. I literally felt like I was in a cramped attic. The pieces are for the most part priced close to what I would offer so I want complain about the prices. Still the pieces for what they are asking I would expect to be cleaned up better than they are. How about washing out some drawers and putting a little elbow grease into making these pieces look like they want out of the attic? A little oil, a bit of polish, a scrape filler here and there, give me a little effort for my money before I hand it over.  The other thing that gets me is that they have 4 locations. This sucks. If your consignment I really don't want to shop four stores in three parts of the valley in for things. This is one time a large location like UFO on 16th  got it right,

Been to two of the locations and this one was not as good. The food nor the building measured up to my first visit to a Scottsdale location, which madr me a fan.   Here I had to send my chicken katsu back because it was cooked so hard that it was not enjoyable and not eatable.  The Macaroni salad here isn't as creamy and good as it is at the other location I've gone to.  And the cabbage comes cooked on this plate at this location.  The restaurant is bigger  here but the place isn't kept as cool as it needs to be to dine in comfort on a hot day.  Then there's an awful overpowering smell of water damaged ceilings/walls that just made me think this location wasn't clean.

Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (Sunnyslope/Dunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this location. Man the place was jacked! It's larger and you find a few more or different items as a result. The prices are the same as the other location on items that both have stocked. But this place looked like it had been hit by a plane. Broken stuff, stuff on the floor, stuff falling off hangers, stuff in the wrong departments and wrong shelves. Tables in complete disarray! Bedding and pillows on the floor. Lines...OMG! What long lines!  The couple of items that interest me that I spotted I passed on rather than wait in these long lines. No staff on the floor offering help. One poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers. Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear. So when I saw items of interest without a price I just respected her by not asking for help and leaving the items where I found them.  The odd thing is 3 hours before I had just shopped my favorite location where all was calm, organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals.

Discovered this gem on a Friday afternoon. Great Latte. Cool Kick back down to earth staff. More comfortable vibe than any coffeehouse in Seattle I've been to. Great of them to have the Heather Hill Photo showing for Provety Pets going on when I stopped in. I was able to browse the photos and then order without feeling I had to.   They could use a few more flavors for their coffee drinks though, I like butter rum and butterscotch if you;re reading. For the moment it;s not walking distance for me but I consider it a great neighborhood spot.

I popped in mid week and had the $4 pitcher of margaritas which equals about 2 glasses becauses its filled with ice. They very good. Also had the original wings and they were pretty good for being on the small side for $5 during happy hour.  Th sauce has a tiny bite of heat and the wings are crispy just like I want them.  It seemed to me that the place could be a great hang out.  And apparrently a few people have made it to the status of regulars and are known and acknowledged upon arrival and departure. The mesquite chicken smell draws you in from outside.

Walked in the other day. Looked at the dashboard size buffet of 8 maybe 10 items. One of those being fried chicken, which is probably better done across the street. Walked back out and will never return. The place is a rat hole! The building should be condemned.

Made my way in on Saturday night. The parking lot was full for this little strip mall. So I was a little surprised that only about 20 -25 of us were in the Dilly Dally. I guess there's about 4 locations in the mall to hang out at.   However I loved the bar. The Juke box was rockin the ultimate cocktail lounge tunes: BB King, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin. It just so went with the wood panel, long bar, tall tiny tables, the ceiling fans and fish tank.   The drinks are cheap and strong and they have the Fish Tank Specials which were about 8 bottles placed in front of the tank of liquors you just don't find people ordering on any given week. These were $2.75 for a shoot! I was tempted but I didn't try any of them. Still I thought it was pretty cool.   There are 6 TV screens and a mess of other things to entertain you while drinking; pool table, darts, shuffleboard, pinball and a couple other arcade games. Then there is always the other people around you and the staff to hold your attention.   I didn't visit the ladies restroom so I don't know what the case is there but the bar was clean and neat and warm (winter night) though the ceiling fans were all quietly going.   if I lived closer I could see becoming a regular here, it reminded me of a neighborhood bar up in Alaska where one seeks refuge in the darkness of it from the weather outdoors and the traffic of tourists. And I wouldn't call this place a dive. It's just not a modern slick bar, but it's a warm neighborly place where you want expect bar fights to pop up anytime soon.

It's quaint and drinks are reasonable. The bartenders are still nice and free pour a great cocktail.  The jukebox plays good music.  It reminds me of a beloved bar in Alaska on a winter night because it is warm & dark inside and the walls are wood paneled.  And the bartender offers to call you a cab after 2 drinks when I cashed out.

I went in for the cheap breakfast for the first time at noon today. I had the $3 plate. It was okay. My toast was perfect & buttery. I was going to have the $4.75 plate with french toast until I learned it came with one slice of toast! That was very disappointing to learn the price jumps a $1.75 and you get only one slice of dipped toast but could get two pancakes, it doesn't make sense. I wonder how big and fluffy the pancakes are, but not enough to risk it and order them. I just don't get it, why they think one slice of french toast is a fair deal.  Anyhow the eggs and bacon came with that, they were cooked okay. Could have done a more presentable delivery of the meal at home. Have seen a more presentable job done at many other eateries through out the USA at independently owned or chain restaurants. So I'm in no rush to return here for the breakfast, even if it is cheap. Unlike some I won't be abandoning other long standing breakfast joints for this. After all you get what you pay for. And i prefer my breakfast in a sunny and brighter place as well verses a dark drab bar, but to each their own choice.

The place is small but, I see it as cozy. There is also outside seating that is great to enjoy on a beautiful day or evening.   The owner waited on me. And made me the best Viennese Mocha, I  think is possible. Excellent to the last drop! I learned they roast and blend their own beans. Well someone here knows what they are doing because this was the smoothest coffee drink at a coffeehouse I think I have yet to have. And hey ... I lived in Seattle for almost twenty years I have been to some coffeehouses, let me tell ya!   I went to their website www.GrindersCoffeeCo.com  It's a great little website. It explains the place well  ,as well as their coffee and I also learned they have a rotating art showing on the walls that change the 1st Saturday of each month and jazz or  blues playing on the patio the 2nd Saturday of each month.   I might just be there for this first Music night in 2010. Say Hi if you see me around there getting my caffeine buzz on anytime. I'll try it again before I give them a five star rating.

I come back because the ladies pour a good whiskey & 7 and the wings are awesome. The Happy hour drink prices also get me to return. I like the decor of the bar and it draws a good regular crowd. Not into the off-site track beating but it's there. Both the bartenders I have dealt with have been really nice and made an effort to remember my name on a later visit. That's pretty nice, makes you feel a bit welcome. can always find a regular to shoot the breeze with for a moment if you stick around and say hello. It's alright place. The customer appreciation weekend went off well, wish they had those more often.

Well it was St. Patrick's day and I could not think of anywhere to go but here, that might be celebrating. Oh the were definately into it up in here! haha patrons and staff were both decked out for the day in green and with hats, tee-shirts, plastic jewlery and just about anything you can find related to the day.The crowd was happy and I talked to a lot more people than on the average stop in. The dining room and bar were both filled. The Irish music was filling the place, the green beer was flowing as one might expect at a discounted rate. There was a corn beef & cabbage plate special being offered up as well as the usual menu items and the Wed .40 cent wing deal they now have started. There was St Paddys day decoration and give aways from happy hour into the evening. A fun and lively pub it was. My only complaint was that drinks were all being served in limp little plastic cups; mixed drinks and the beer.

Well I opted for the cheeseburger plate with fris and salad for $8.50 that was suppose to have montery jack but was delivered with yellow (American I think) cheese.  Same for the other burger at our table and the beef burrito a la cart at our table looked dry and was I was told.  This was my first visit and we came for lunch and sat on the patio. The chips and salsa were good. The softdrinks are big and you get refills which is good since they are $2.35 each!  But looking at the other plates with mexican food it looked good and smelled wonderful! The staff was reasonaly nice.    They have a small bar but the special drinks are HIGH at $7 & $8!  It was a pricey lunch with tip I spent $14.   Still I might try a mexican meal one day because it smells so good!

Nothing stood out about the place. I had lunch here with a friend that is a fan of the place. The lunch came and it was just fine. Besides being quiet and appearing clean the place looked more Japanese than Chinese to me. And the waitperson, well she was icy and abrupt.  I'm just not feeling that it's a place I will be wanting to revisit anytime soon.

My review is on the Sprouts Sandwich Counter only.  I don't shop here or at any of the locations at this point because none are in walking distance of home.   But I was in with a friend and we grabbed SANDWICHES at the counter. They were made to order and they were good!  They were so fresh too! I had the Chicken salad on Multi-grain bread. Yummy, can't wait to stop in again for one.  And the full sandwich was $2.99 ( w/o cheese).   Maybe I will shop here after all from time to time.

I disagree with  Fred M., I think the burgers are very good and wonder why people go into the Mc D's instead?!  They have a greater variety of burgers, chicken sandwiches, wings, fries, chili fries, milkshakes etc. And you get better tasting food and more of it for your money and they have a value menu and 2 for $3 and 2 for $4 deals that will fill you up.  I'd eat Rally's food any day over Mc Donald's, Burger King, In n Out Burgers or Arby's if there were only more Rally's Hamburger places around.  The only draw back is there is only outside seating and drive through service, but with good November weather like I had when I went sitting outside under an umbrella table was just fine.

I use to fly a lot but as the cost raises and terror took the skies I stopped. I however flew Alaska Airlines one way from Seattle to Phoenix to transport my beloved dog. They are still the best! Their pet transport fee is still the lowest when your pet travels at the same time you do. When I got to my seat there was a post-a-note saying I'm on board too! That reassured me, and others like me that our pet was on the plane. I thought that was such a sweet and thoughtful touch. Kudos Alaska Airline! I flew you also because many trips between Seattle and Alaska with my prior dog had been successful and horror free. You know how to take care of our fury members, as well as the rest of us and you do it at fairer fare than the others. Your cleaning staff is awesome after the flight they get in there and tidy things up for the next group, find and turn in our forgotten items like my L.G. Lotus phone and quickly get it to us before we leave the airport! When I went to claim my baggage and dog your porter took the work out of it by having all my belongings and my dog gathered and ready to go curbside for my pick up! The porter  checked to make sure my dog was mine and even minded my bags while I took my dog to the PHX doggie walk at the airport to relieve herself! All in all I felt I and my canine companion were looked out for like we were more than just a head count  from the start to the end of the trip. Further more all my belongings including my computer and camera equipment in my checked in baggage came to me undisturbed and undamaged. I thank you a thousand times for your kid gloves to my personal belongings and with my dog. I'll be flying with you again.

Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe.   Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet.   You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring.  First stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star.  From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans.   Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed.   Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20.   While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic.   The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice.   All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal.   I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste.

Ate here a couple of weeks ago.  I had the Med burger meal with skinny fries and the works minus cheese on my burger.  Awesome hamburger!  Awesome Lemonade!  Good service and clean tables& floors. A tad pricey but worth it.

I found myself with an hour to waste last week while I waited for work on my cell phone. So I decided to go in for a bite to eat since it was dinner time and the smell in the parking lot was good.   I ended up having a nice time as I set at the bar and conversed with a senior couple that comes in frequently. We both ordered appetizers since they were half price at happy hour and we all had a drink. I had a bottle beer. They only offer a dollar off drinks at happy hour and they are still overpriced.  The food was ok. The bartender that basically ignored me and had 3 others assist me kept talking to the couple I was talking to also. She never spoke to me or made any eye contact. Hmmmm Anyway she said on more than 3 accounts how she loved the cheese fries and onion rings we were sharing. Maybe she wanted some? Well the orders were bigger than the 3 of us could consume and we trashed the remaining. LOL  I thought the Onion rings were grand, but was not impressed with the cheese fries. At half price they are a good deal for either but at full price I would rethink before spending 7 bucks on fries.

I have not been to this restaurant in over a year. I was somewhat excited to have an late lunch/early dinner of Italian today so I decided to give it another try.  The service was awesome. I was the first to request to dine outside and they quickly accommodated and provided attentive service.  I started with the appetizer of baked stuffed mushrooms that are stuffed with goat cheese, spinach and spicy Italian sausage.($8)  Tasty and I'm told popular, however I was not impressed and would never recommend them. Something about that spicy just didn't click for me though I like spicy food, I just felt it was not a good paring with the smooth mild goat cheese and mushroom.  Still it was the best thing I would eat at this experience. I ordered a Caesar salad ($3) - over priced should be free. A small handful of bitter romaine lettuce and a drizzle of Caesar dressing 3 or 4 croutons with a generous portion of cheese in a small bowl.  So bad it took three croutons to get the fork-full of lettuce down. The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill.    My entrée was to be Carbonaro ($13). I have had it at other restaurants and loved it. I have made it and served it to a number of people and they loved it. Never have I seen or even heard of a pouched egg served on this dish, as I was assured it must have to be Carbonaro. So I tried it. Noodles are some kind of pasta I never heard of but it's served hard and I mean about 3x harder than el dente' .  Sauce was not creamy and did not coat the noodles or the crisp ham in this case. sauce was tasteless. I tried about 3 bites but once asked I had to admit I didn't care for it. My server admitted it was quite different and agreed to bring me another entrée.   So I went with the Chicken Malino ($12).  Roasted chicken, bow-tie pasta, creamy garlic sauce, mushrooms & sun-dried tomatoes.   Served in a large bowl. A generous portion  about 2 servings actually.   It was better or as I told the server more palatable.  I ate half of it took the rest to go but feed it to my dog what does she know about good Italian anyway?   Ruby (my dog) says: "Andiamo! Sono un cane-io non so nemmeno il cibo è italiano!"  Anyway as I thought about the food after trying 2 entrées I came to the this conclusion. The building, the tablecloths, the interior and even the patio are what this restaurant chain sells well.  It makes ones visit memorable.  It's the setting for a nice date or to bring out of town guest to, to socialize of  wines and to break bread together.  It's the backdrop to some nice dining photos as well.  It's moderately priced yet over priced after all it's mostly pasta and lettuce you're getting.  But when it comes to the food, they pretty much threw together ingredients that would sound or appear in print to be appealing.  It's a simple menu that doesn't take much talent or time to prepare.  It's really rather awful food placed in a beautiful setting. How anyone who can cook Italian or has ever been to one of the many little Italy communities in America or Canada can really say they love the food here is beyond my ability to believe or comprehend.  So if you go drink lots of wine and maybe you'll forget that the food is lousy you are buying.  But hopefully the staff will be attentive and keep your glasses full.  And maybe you'll get a few nice photos on your phone.  Oh and none of the food looks like it does in the pictures added to this review site! I knew I should have took pictures of something while there.  My meal plus ice tea ($2.50)  Was $24.51.  NOT a cheap date for my book.  Multiple that by 2 or more and add wine or other drinks and you'll scratch your head and ask yourself  " For this I paid what?  And I'm hungry in 2 hours!"   I gotta go I'm sure there's something in my home fridge that will hold me over until my next meal!

My kind of drinking place. Big ass bar. Lots of talkative friendly people. Mature acting students and a crowd beyond our college years all come together and have a great time. Food is good and prices reasonable. Food special M-F if you're drinking.  Bottled beers kept icy cold in a bed of ice.  Smoking patio in the shade. Plenty of parking. Great selection of artists on the jukebox.   They have a stage but I have yet to learn of live music or a karaoke night,  maybe soon.

Had a not so good experience at Nello's. I first must admit I'm ancient. First had Nello's Pizza back in the 80's while living in Tempe. I think that might be when they originated. Nello's and a pizzeria called Sunny's back in the 80's had the most awesome pizza. As a college student it was great to get away from Pizza Hut & Domino's Pizza and have gourmet pizza with a couple of friends.    So upon my return to the Valley I had hopes that I could relive that awesome Pizzeria experience at Nello's that I last experienced 18 years ago when I was here for a wedding of a friend and went out for Pizza during that visit.  I'm pretty sure the location has changed.  And sadly so has the pizza.  I ordered a 10" Pan crust with Sausage, smoked bacon, feta and Onions (non-red kind).  The crust was okay, tender and yeasty I would say.  The feta cheese could not be tasted it was so sparse on the pie. I actually only saw one crumb of feta!  The smoked bacon was minced very fine (finer than war rations bacon), it was also twice the price of the other toppings and twice as limited in appearing on my pie! The Sausage made a decent appearance on the pie. It's flavor was over powering in it's nickle size lumps.  Sorta tasted like an old man germy wool muffler, probably the ones recipe they have fucked with. The onions could be tasted in a few bites. The regular cheers topping was in good standing and had a pleasant stringy pull while hot.     A 10" Pizza ($13.50), a not so chilled 4 Peaks Heffie pint of beer ($3.50) and a $2 tip and the city's cut in tax made for a $20 disappointing meal for one!  I felt completely ripped off by the lack of toppings I paid for.  I should have complained but what good would have done? So I just ate and left.  Doubt if I'll suggest the place or even return again unless I'm not buying!  How they maintain such esteemed ratings is a mystery to me.

I went to this Staples because it is close to home. I first went to buy paper. Was astounded at the price for a ream of all purpose paper. To get the advertised ream for $2.99, one had to get a rewards card that works (mine has never) and then apply on line for a rebate! Hell no, who has time for this shit? When one can get it for $2.99 or less at just about any other store one shops?  I also wanted Resume paper, the selection was very limited and a believe a bit overpriced and can also be picked up at a Walmart, Target, or Office Depot (my preferred office supply store) for a fairer price. I left without paper. Oh and the customer service was non-exsistence, other than pointing me in the direction of what I might be looking for as they stood around gossiping among themselves.  However, I returned the next afternoon with my computer for the free PC Tune Up. An E-Tech was called up to assist me at the check in desk for computers. It was slightly after 3pm, and he was going to check my computer in until I asked the turn around time and was told I would not get it back today because it was late! Mind you the place was open until 7 or 8 pm.  I opt out and asked if they scheduled appointments. Now informed that they did I made an appointment for the next day at 11am.   The next day I arrive and check in my computer. I inform them I am having trouble suddenly connecting to the Internet as well as an ongoing annoying problem of computer maintenance messages popping up, and a virus program I bought from Staples not working anymore and not expired.   The General Manager Shalamar, was there and assured me they would call when it was ready. I leave. Almost 4 hours later I get a call. I return and am given my computer and told there were no viruses found and that nothing was done so still ongoing have the on going issues and it has not been repaired, but I only find this out after asking!   Couldn't someone have called me in those 4 hours and told me this? Maybe I would have given an OK to further investigate to repair the system! I was about to walk out when the GM said wait, there is paperwork they should be giving you and they are to go over it with you. I wait. The two techs bicker over why it isn't printed out. One sends it to the printer and walks away. I wait. I wait until the GM has the guy paged to return! He takes it off the printer and proceeds to go over the information based on my PC check up/ Tune Up. Apparent to the GM this guy is doing a half ass job of it, the GM listening in makes him stop and go over a section or two in a more professional manner.   In the end nothing is resolved and I am presented with two options they can take to get my computer operating for $60 and an overnight stay of my computer. One which would delete all data I have stored and restore it to starting status. I opt to take it and make other arrangements and return to them as a last resort- which I openly tell them.   I get my PC home and I play around with it for about 30 or 40 minutes. Mind you I have little knowledge of computer issues. I find a "restore recently deleted files from Trash " selection and click it. Presto my computer is restored in 90 seconds!   But that apparently this was to detailed a fix for them to do at a Tune Up that took half the work day!   But kudos to the GM, if he wasn't' babysitting them the entire day I don't think any of them would have done a thing the entire day! He even had to tell them to clean up the front counter and register area as I waited and waited for that computer report which turned out to be vital paperwork in helping me fix my own system problem. Glad I waited! Need I say, I have no intent on returning for anything here.

First of all note the name changed to AMF Scottsdale Lanes.  Hey it doesn't smell! Its a nice bowling alley and I can imagine spending a few hours here like I did tonight with my Phoenix Fabulous Forty Women's Club.   The bar is very nice for a bowling alley. They even have a pool table!  They serve decent food and cold drinks to your lanes with waiter service.   All the lanes, screens and scoring boards are new, clean and state of the art. There's no old smelly gross carpet to be avoided either, which is classic of bowling alleys I have been in!   Prices for rental equipment and lane use is average cost.   I had a great time and will definitely return to enjoy the faculties again and again.   Oh and the staff were so nice and professional also!

Been there Done that. The beer i had was icy cold. The band was not so great I think they were Rock Lobster. The crowd was mostly 20 something college kids.   There was no wait service except at the bar. Which sucked also.  My friends knew someone in the band and fortunately we did not have to wait in line or pay a cover. Because believe me it wasn't worth it.   Maybe I'm just to old for this scene? We blew out of there just before midnight. No one could get me to return to that so called nightlife scene. Guys dancing with themselves and other guys, same goes for the girls. The patio scene was even lame. What happened to mingling and being social?

It's a lively place for happy hour and it's loud by 7pm on a Friday and crowded.  The food is okay. I tried 4 different items but was most impressed with the tempura shrimp.  I don't frequent sushi bars but I love Japanese food otherwise. I tried their sushi a crab roll it was no biggie, Neither was the short ribs or the spicy sesame wings. The plate presentation for the dishes were nice, I'll give them that.

My double cheese burger and Medium fries were trash worthy. The wrapper was hot so I thought the burger would be.... WRONG! The fries were warm but not fresh, you know how they get when they have set for awhile under the heat lamps.   However much to my surprise my frozen mocha was very good.  I called the toll free number and gave them feedback, first time I was ever moved to do that at a McDonalds! They are to mail me out a coupon to replace my burger and fries. I will not be cashing them in at this location that's for sure!

Well I'm a fan. I have been to fancier more kiss ass places and I have been into but not stayed at worst.  I think my Spa -Pedicure was AWESOME.  Kim took a long time pampering and detail trimming my cuticles and massaging my feet. She removed all the dead skin and callus. I love how my feet feel! Stacey did my nails with white tips. I'm not very experienced with the artificial nails. But these feel better than when I had them before. Lighter and also I feel she cleaned up my cuticles where as the guy at a place in Phoenix did not.  I'm getting use to them. the length is a bit longer for me. I do think I have 2 nails that lean off center if you really look hard at them.  Still the women are very nice and I plan to give them another try or two. The last place I went the first time was good but it did not stay up to standards in visit 2 and 3. We'll see about this place.  It's clean, spacious, offers many services, competitively priced, welcomes walk-ins,  has a large color selection, plays soft relaxing radio station, has comfortable chairs, has great hours 7 days a week. Plenty of parking also.    The women speak Vietnamese and clear fluent English and will engage in conversation  with you, it is not a chop shop nail place at all.  Go give them a chance. Even tell them Brenda yelped and sent you.

Great enexpensive food. Hot sub I had was awesome for just being ham & cheese, cost equal or slightly more than Subway and an inch or two bigger. $7  The Fried Mushrooms and Zuc is also good and a great portion for $5 each.  Will eventually try the pizza and another sub, wings or even a calzone.  The place ain't nothing fancy but they offer a couple of tables should you need to eat there  They'll also deliver if spend $11 Which covers all pizza orders or a sub with fries.

Busy as all of them seem to be. Large menu of choices. I tried a new egg dish and it was excellent.  Also the maple coffee is so yum I wonder why every barista isn't making it?  Hmmm I think I need one of those this week!  And their coffee drinks are cheap!  If it wasn't always a wait I would eat there more.

Everything I have tried here is great.  Prices are very reasonable. Few things are over $9 and many are about $6.   Love the shrimp fried rice with a very fair amount of medium size shrimp.  Appreciate that they deliver and our fast for only a $1 fee.  They have a wide delivery area also so at home or work I can order.    I highly recommend you try their food. They say it's New York Style. I just know its darn good!  Every month I order from them a couple of times.

It's very different than the usual Mexican restaurant. This is Jalisco style. Not Mexican American. Authentic. Portions are small and no melted cheese on the nacos or most dishes but Athentic crumbled mexican style white chees very mild flavored.  It was okay not bad but I don't forsee myself jonesing to return.  Margarita was a bit high and I don't think they use Tequilia and I didn't see a bar. I think they may use white wine, which isn't unheard of in small family owned places in Mexico.

The selection of stores is just okay. However the layout is not good. For most people accessing both sides for the stores or theatre they will find that they prefer to move their vehicle than cross to the furthest side by foot through a massive parking lot. If you are unfortunately one who arrives by public transportation, then you are just up the creek in a hot asphalt parking lot.

I like a simple pepperoni pizza on seasoned butter garlic crust and I like the hot wings.  I use to eat  from a different location but this one is good also. Oh I had a hot sub here and it was mighty yummy. Can't beat the prices and the crust if you are one who likes to eat it comes in a number of seasoned flavors and is tender and good.

I just started going here. I had the hot wings which are not suicidal hot.  They are very good.  I was there for night happy hour. The house rum is AWFUL. Even with cola and hot wings I could not drink it. I will most likely go here frequently because it has great drink prices and happy hour $5 appetizers after 7pm

It's grown on me. I think the flatbread steak dish and pulled pork sliders are both awesome. The entire menu looks good but a bit over priced for pasta plates.  The wings are still good. The Fries are also. And OH the Baja slaw I crave! Spicy and crunchy slaw, I have tried but can't find or recreate the slaw recipe. Hoping to get it one day cause a serving is to small.

Popped in again today! Had Chili Cheese Fries and a 20 oz root-beer float for under $6! Enough chili cheese fries to share too. They were awesome as was the float.   Service was quick. place was half full of High Schoolers but things were still clean, neat and orderly. A few nearby business people popped in also and were greated as regulars.   I'm a fan now! I'll be back to try something different or more of the same.

It's a smooth ride. It sometimes eliminates the need to transfer buses and the waiting that entails. It runs frequently and it runs early until late, beyond Valley Metro bus service.  Still it's pretty slow and I think the money could have been better used to extend and increase route service throughout the valley.

I was waning to do a Saturday Brunch with a friend for my birthday. This was the only buffet brunch I came across for a Saturday. I had been wanting to check out their buffet regardless since I have never been.    I loved it. The steak and french toast with fruit really did it for me! The sausage was also good. Didn't care for the grits or Chicken fried steak w/gravy. But all in all I had an enjoyable time grazing and talking.  I saw the dessert and chocolate fountain but, I saved that for a future visit after eatting so much french toast with fruit sauces.  Steak was so tender and tasty also. Table service for beverages and clearing was also good. Just wish I lived closer cause I love breakfast food and would go more often for the brunch which is 7 days a week from 7am - 11:30am.  Price includes your drinks and it's under $10 per adult!

Yikes we had my adopted father Mr. Eng funeral banquet here a year ago.  Today it got 6 violations and a warning from the Health Dept to clean up or close down!   Even then I thought the food was so-so. Many things were authntically presented but did not taste so well.  The service for a planned banquet was awful! My sister had to go head to head with the manager. We were waiting for tables upto 25 minutes and even then the tables were not grouped together. Their concern was making as much money as they could so they did not reserve any tables for the family/group!  Mind you we had a deposit down and planned menu!  I'm glad nobody that no one (I have heard from) got sick. I have no interest in returning.

Consistantly prepared the same from one local restaurant to the next.  I love the Walnut glazed prawns.  But other dishes are also good.  It's decent food with an Asian appeal. I stir clear of the dishes with a lot of dye in the sauce but that's usually only 2. It's freshly prepared about every 25 minutes in most cases and it's openuntil 10:30pm

I too will agree that they are a friendly staff, the place is clean and the service quick. And they still manage to make brief friendly conversation while doing their job. The food is fresh and they actually understand the concept of splitting a sandwich by cutting and wrapping the paper around two halfs! Can't say that they understand or care at other locations.

Come on people it's a Goodwill.. I feel sorry for anybody giving the place a 3,4, or 5 star rating. It's full of stuff someone dead and couldn't take with them or stuff that somebody didn't want nor did their friends. It's usually dirty and smells. So if this is your idea of ultimate shopping, I certainly won't be following your reviews. Because frankly you dress funny, smell funny and sit on chairs with 3 legs. Otherwise you best be pretty creative and handy to make a find here awesome.

I to really wanted to like the place. It seems to have a lot of cars in the lot when I go by so I stopped in tonight at 6:30 on a Friday. There were not that many tables occupied but the stools at the bar were full.   I walked up to the bar and ordered a Vodka Collins and asked for a menu. I was thrown off guard when the bartender asked me what that was! I told her how to make the drink. Which was served in the wrong type of glass and without a garnish!    I decided then that $4 was all this place was getting from me!  I am so sick of bars hiring untrained bartenders because they think a cute girl or guy is all that is required. Well I'm not gay and I don't like girls so this doesn't work for me. And the guys usually don' appeal to me either if they are clueless.  I don't tip the clueless. That's my new motto. The drink still was not up to par so I sucked it down and called it a night.  As for the rest of the service; I was asked by 3 waitresses if I would like to order since I had a menu in the 29 minutes I was there, but when I first came in I could not find one.  The menu was not very appealing so I probably will never return.

I went and tried the Lucky Boy burger, fries and Peanut butter milk shake. I had heard from one yelper that is was to die for. Meantime I heard from one non-yelper that the quality had dimensioned with the newest ownership.  All I can say is that it was food. And it was warm and I ate in. Was not impressed by anything. Service was quick but not very welcoming. Interior is drab but reasonably clean. They provide no public bathroom which I think should be against the law if they provide an eating area.  I found nothing to die for here, not even that shake. Most likely I won't find reason to return and some people will certainly regret they tried it.

i go pass the place daily almost since I live along the route. Place always seems empty. So when people gather there is beyond me.  And how it got the 2010 New Times vote for an empty bar but the number one bartender is even a bigger mystery.  True many of the bartenders in the area don't know shit about mixing drinks and were only hired as eye candy but how does an empty bar get this ranking?

Because it's free it's helpful.  But the routes are to long and winding. One gets car sick. The ride is rough and the windows constant loud rattling is insane. Routes stop to early for most during the heat season. Paying even.25 for this service as irecently propsed is in general a waste of money for most.

While living up in the PNW of Washington I would see these tee-shirts and bumper stickers for the In n Out Burger joints and wonder what I was missing. So I come to AZ and I see them all over. One day (months ago) I try one. Hmmm I haven't missed a darn thing is my conclusion. It hasn't grown on me. I've not been tempted to return. I've been repelled to avoid it is more like what happened. All desire to experience it again was removed by one visit to this lame enterprise. Nothing is cool about it, fun about it, or great. I love burgers and fries, can eat them three or more times a week if I allowed myself, however this place doesn't do the great American meal any justice, sorry they could fold up and close their doors without making a blip on any radar screen of dining experience.

Not much has changed at Patties, I'm sorry to report.   What has is that they upgraded the TVs! The place is still filthy and reminds one of a bad frat house or a Gila Bend bar, as some have mentioned. It's the dive of dive bars that I have been in through out my USA and Canadian travels. Oh it's no longer cheap to to drink there and they do now have glassware not just plastic cups for your drinks, so that has changed.   The barkeeper, is an old guy who has been there past his prime. There are photos of him among photos of the crowds on a board where he looks 15 years younger. By now he has no personality and patience for the drinking crowd and this was at the start of Happy Hour on a Tuesday! The way he throws together a mixed drink or offers up the beer/wine list you can tell he just doesn't care anymore. It's pretty awful and sad at the same time.   One day a week ( I forget which) according to the flier on the wall they offer up a patty (aka burger) night. No other food is served here and how they get the OK to serve on that night from the health board is a mystery. Maybe the pull out a grill into the parking lot, is my best guess.   The jukebox is a newer version of the equipment, but I didn't stick around to hear it. A regular, some creepy skinny dude said he was going to play it, but warned me no one wold like what he played. I took him at his word.   The place has a few hundred dollars of mostly US $1 bills stuck on the walls and ceiling in the area close to the bar. They have words, names and comments boldly inked on them. The barkeeper was busy stapling a few recent ones to the wall. He commented to another customer when asked, that he doesn't read them, ever! because only the drunk write and leave them. My what an attitude for one in the drinking& hospitality business!   Among those mostly dirty and yellowing from nicotine bills you will see a sign near the old gold register handwritten selling "All Cigarettes are $10"! Holy Moley and I don't smoke! But apparently many of the patrons do, because the building is split down the center leaving the place open to the sky and elements, which apparently allows them to forgo the nonsmoking ordinances now in effect for establishments. So many freely light up and smoke in the center of the floor/building.   Out of sheer curiosity, on my why out I opened the the women's room door. Eeewwe, the place recked like a bad outhouse, though it had a nice white new pedestal sink and commode, but their was no way I could stomach the room to even primp in the mirror!  I did manage to take a picture at the bar to give you a glimpse of the place. Hopefully it will help you check the stop off your list. Oh and one other thing, I wish bar owners would not publish their political views with bumper stickers in ther establishment - put it on your car or not post it.

I went for the special tonight on my first visit. A little embarassed to order it because it was called the Fat Ass Burger. It was a big double burger meal deal for $7.50. Beef was a bit dry but I love that they are not pre-pressed frozen burger patties but more like burgers you form yourself.  I also likes the fries and onion rings that came with it, they were awesome. I also liked that ranch sauce they give you for dipping and an old school can of Shasta pop!  I had left overs and my dog Ruby had no complaints at all with getting them.

With an exception for the bagel and egg morning special the food is overpriced and I've had better. A small sandwhich for $13 or $14 with a 1/8 cup of bad potatoe salad just isn't my idea of a fair or pleasant lunch (Aaron's Fav),   The staff openly complaining about one another is always a turn off to me no matter where it happens and it has happened here more times than I care to record.   By far their best asset in staffing is the waitress Donna. She quickly remembers you and how you take your coffee and tries effortlessly it seems to make your visit an enjoyable one.

I like RR. I'm willing to pay the outragious price for some drink with a long name here. I love the burger choices, the hot wings, the seafood splatter. Oh and the bottomless Root Beer float!  I love the new Royality Card.  The staff here is very good, some of the best service in AZ. Which says a lot because AZ is unfortunately known for awful service.

I have given it a few tries, but it just leaves so much to desire! A neighborhood store is suppose to have personality. Where is the familiar clerks, produce guy, kid that helps with your grocery working his/her first job and others? Where are products that reflect the demographic demands and likings of the neighborhood? What happened to being able to get change for the bus or laundry? It's all missing at your local Fresh & Easy! Instead you get this clinical feel like you are in the twilight hours of dawn shopping when it's midday! You are left to select from predetermined brands & products selected by some unknown corporate giant to better fill their pockets than meet your wants. The place appears empty with the exception of the prying eyes of a lone security guard and an occasional appearance of an employee to gather carts.  I can't help feeling almost surgical as I walk down these wide brightly lite lanes seeing multiple Fresh & Easy labels on product after product, feeling I have no choice when I know I should have ample temptations in my range. All while wondering and praying that this is not the grocery store experience of the future anyone ever imagined, and thinking that if i is, online grocery order and delivery from a corporate giant with a better website and more variety and home delivery is worth the price and a better experience for my senses than this lame chain. Why do people even go in this cold, unfriendly place of limited supply rations and call it shopping? I've been to stores in little communities in Alaska that gets groceries and sundries flown in once a month or brought in on a barge that offers more to shopping than this chain! Ugh I hate it! I think two stars is generous.

Great Service and Management.  Great ribs and cocktails. BBQ Chicken is salty to me. It's a wonderful up scale pace no matter where you visit a location. Will return for Steak.

Not sure what to give this place. Went in for breakfast with two friends this Saturday. Menu for breakfast is very limited to steel cut oatmeal, quiche and a breakfaast sandwhich. We each had the breakfast sandwhich on different breads with different cheese, meat and toppings.  I asked for my bread to be buttered but it was not so I got cold butter from the kitchen to spread on my basically cold sandwhich that had just arrived. They also season the eggs without telling you with some herbs that turned out to taste ok but looked questionable. Two of us had ice tea, which was very weak and one had coffee but I no idea what he thought of it since he didn't have any more.  One of the cooks brought out a fresh baked blueberry scone as an apology for sending out a less than perfect breakfast.  Hmmm makes me wonder if he knew our food was damn near cold?   The scone was large and delicious. Actually all the bake goods looked very good on display.   The place is very charming and it even has outside seating which is nice.  But the bill was $26 for cold breads with cold eggs and a small meat portion that if you didn't look for it one would miss.  So I give the place 2 stars. Earned by a good scone, a cute building and a kind gester of the staff.  But I wasn't impressed enough to return.  Oh yeah I found a hair on my egg but I'm hoping it was my own. But as I think about it now It probably was not mine as I read others review. Ewwwww  Also the lunch menu does not appeal to me.  And many would agree that the presentation is lacking and the price is on the high side. And while serving beer upsets another yelper because she will not study there because of it now. I don't think it has hurt the business and I'm sure their limited seating does not encourage people to dwell for hours anyhow. Oh and parking is very limited also another reason one might not linger for hours.

Popped in for a minute on a Wed night. It was busy. But as all the gay bars in this neighborhood I unfortunately reside in as a straight woman. It's a total mens club not a dance club. So I did not stay. I was in need of some fun upbeat music and it wasn't happening there.  Seems all bars in the neighborhood are gay or dull but usually both.

Went to lunch with friends. One ordered 2 slices of peperoni pizza ($3.75 per slice, a bit pricey for one item slices in my mind), the other ordered the lunch special plate ($9): 1 slice of pizza (she choose cheese) with a side salad (in this case the Asian salad minus nuts). None of this was appealing to me by price or appearance. I ordered the lunch pasta plate choosing spaghetti & chicken piccata with a side salad (Cesar salad) with the drink included. My plate set me back $10.50, which is more than most people who eat lunch out during the week try to spend. Not a fan of the one item topping pizza and not gullible enough to go for the spicy Italian sausage slice at $4.25 a slice! I figured I went with my best option.   Well as I said theirs did not look very appealing. The Asian salad dressing and few slivers of wantons was all that made this lettuce salad Asian. Usually that salad is a cabbage based salad. The pizza slices were not very large for the price by the way and are basically precooked and warmed over when ordered with whatever topping you select. NYPD does this a lot better and gives you more options to top your pizza off with and you can choose more than one.   The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the chicken piccata was tender and flavorful but still not outstanding and for the price was a very, very, small serving. My salad was old - ends were turning brown and it was not very crisp and the dressing thick and not so good. The small piece of bread that they rave about as homemade was dry and served without butter. I mean it was really dry! Like maybe days old dry!   All this organic and gluten free food did not impress me. Glad I don't require a gluten free diet and have lived many years without organic indigents, because if this is a fine example of both I would quickly lose interest in food. Oh and that drink was also an organic juice based 10 oz soda that by itself sold for $2.50 when not a part of the lunch special.   The restaurant itself sits on the corner of an unassuming strip mall. It has a small crowed patio that was full except for the 2 tables in the direct sun without umbrellas. The interior appeared clean and had a casual slightly upscale appearance but also a bit crowed by the closeness of the tables. Therefore this would not be a good place for kids.  Also they don't appear to offer desserts! And our waitress lacked personality and appeared that she would prefer to be somewhere else.   So I give the place 2 stars which is generous with all things taken into account.

The food wasn't so good but the service was on top. The band that played the week night I went was awesome. The dance floor is anice size and set up so is the bar you can belly up to. I'm willing to give the menu another try or two to see if I can find something I think is good and priced fairly well. It grew on me what can I say, sorta like the old barn called Devil House in Tempe. You see all kinds of folks up in there, just like Toby sings and its BIG.

went again a 8 days ago. Had awful slow service. The Nachos were weird and we sent them back. They actually don't know how to cook at this place when you figure that to make nachoes they pour a tortilla soup over the chips and toss extra cheese on it. They don't make nachoes with ground beef at all, they can't make them w/o beans because thats part of the smoked chicked tortilla soup they pour on the chips!  The cheese fries were good.  The drinks all start at $5 at the bar except for the beer.  But my biggest issue with the bar that is making me fall down stars is that I gave them my credit card for my drinks. And Eight days, soon to be nine I am still being charged my drink prices plus and additional $20 that they intially ran an authorization on my card for! I have spoken to their management about it and it still is not cleared! I have left messages which have gone unreturned.  Tomorrow I am going in and kick some country ass and have all charges reversed for the inconvience.  My only question now is this....Who got the bail money?

Ok I had a tamale at the annual Glendale Jazz Blues Fest, I did not actually go inside the place. But the red chili tamale I had was bland and dry with shredded beef brisket at both ends but none in the middle!  Where was the red chili? They offered no salsa with their tamales either and sold no drinks outside their business. The set up nor the tamale did nothing for their image.

They do awesome resue work and Spay & Neuter clinics in low income areas of the greater Phoenix area. They find & need foster homes for more pets. You can volunteer time or donate to help their cause.

Went for lunch a week ago with the same friend that found the place the first time.  None of te dishes were as good as our first visit we both agreed.   It was still a very busy place though. The beverage girl/woman was a bit snobby and said something negative about her tip in Mandrian and much to her surprise I called her on it!  Which shocked the crap out of her - it was priceless!  Little did she know that my Ex is Chinese and spoke the language fluently and thus I picked up something!  That'll teacher to under estimate the knowledge of a sister from the PNW hood!  Haha!

Went in this Wed night to get away from the housemates. Was not in the most upbeat manner. Found the place boring. Football on all screens jukebox cut off. Bunch of old guys mostly. The rest were mostly fat couples getting wasted and guys with to much sideburns. Then a couple of brothers (black men) also old walked in wearing their throw back Shaft leather jackets. Totally weird crowd!  The bartender was a slim young woman that needs to go to bartending school. I watched her attempt to make cocktails with more than 2 ingredients. What a disaster! She over pours and under pours and added some ingredients like whiskey to what was suppose to be a long island!   Pours the largest straigt shoots I have ever seen and I tell you I have been to bars like in MT, WY, AK and New Orleans and not seen anything close to this size of a shoot!  Consulted with some off duty guy on how to make 6 Kamikazes (ended up being 5 and she had to make another that end up being 2.5 drinks instead of 1) and together with a book they came up with a cranberry version because, get this they have no lime juice! What sorta bar in the SW opens its doors without LIMES or LIME JUICE?  The guy kept calling the drink Cosmos and I kept repeating I know the difference and the order was KAMIKAZES.  Then he brings me the book and is still pointing out Cosmos!  I verbally give the bartender the recipe for Kamikazes plus the variation for a blue one. Guy says you must make a lot of drinks! I say you want to hire me - I've got experience?  I tell you if they want to keep the doors open they better get some help with bar and budget knowledge. The budget is being shoot by over pours and wrong pours and if the liquor control sees this they're certian to be busted/fined. Hey but the bartender knows how to wash glasses well so that was a relief to see.  And it's true that drinks are about $4 though the sign says $5! LOL What an experience. I left confident in my bartending skills though I haven't poured in a month!

From the moment you approach the window... you are drawn in not only by the display of a 9 or 10 foot Alien looking being standing there, but also by the name UFO and the furnishings in the window around this alien.  The concept as I see it behind UFO is to rethink your decor and furnishings, all that is new is not the method, think a little green and out of the box and see pieces in a whole new light. Recycle, reuse renew, reinvent the space around you that you call your home or office by installing a 'recyclitude' to how that space becomes your own.   This business has vintage items with attitude! They re-upholster and refinish sofas, tables, beds and seating's with beautiful fabrics that give new life to pieces once discarded as old and done with. There are items that are referred to as offerings that are out of this world! From simple ornaments to pieces of artwork, placemats, pottery & vases that one could design an entirely new dwelling around if one desired.  I found a deal on a cosigned wood bed frame, that I could not walk away from! I count it as the major furniture purchase of the last decade for my home. It has totally reinvented my bedroom from sleeping quarters to a stylish warm place of slumber and refueling that I enjoy retreating to!  I'm certain I'll be buying other furnishings and offerings from UFO for part of my Christmas giving and decorating desires. But I'm even more certain you'll  be finding me there long after the holidays have faded picking the brain of Leonardo Ramirez, owner & proprietor for what the future holds for all of us that adopt his 'recycletude' way of living.   Phoenix Home & Gardens may have stumbled upon it and mentioned UFO in a recent publication (Nov '09 page 42-Shop Talk). However this shopper's Mecca landed unseen 6 months ago, words with out pictures can not begin to describe what landed on (3602) North 16th Street in Phoenix. I suggest you experience and see it for yourself. Get on over there this week and transport your body and mind away from the IKEA, JC Penny frame of living once and for all.

This is the best Ross store I have been in! No Long lines to wait in, Order in the gift and house ware area, unmatched by any other Ross have been in! Order in the the clothing section, nothing on the floor, nothing falling off the hangers and shelves. Found some great deals in the house ware section. Asked a man that works there for a price on 3 items in the home section and actually got answers with price tags on them within a few minutes, like under ten minutes! The cashier was caring and careful with my glass purchases, wrapping them each and double bagging my purchase. Thank you Jordan (associate 105548).   This is by far worth the trip and I can't wait to return to shop this Ross again. I don't think you can get me to another one now. It wasn't packed with people and screaming out of control kids. The selection was good and with the exception of minor chips nothing broken was found in the store!

This is my idea of fast food. Clean, quick and not greasy and friendly quick service. The food is as good as it was years ago when I was in college. This is a different location and the menu has expanded but their main item the Mexican fire broiled chicken, flour tortillas and pinto beans are consistent. So is the salsa and pico de gallo.

The exterior of the building doesn't draw you in. It's plain and drabby. I don't think there is even a display window. They sit some pieces out curbside on the street facing 7th Ave and Mariposa St. This is what caught my eye and let me know they were open.   They have nice stuff here. Some unique furnishings, art pieces and collectibles. I would have loved to have bought a few items this first visit but I have nowhere to put them! Nor do I have enough cash or a credit line for these high priced pieces.   I like that you can move freely about the place without fear of knocking anything over or ending up in a maze that dead-ends like I have come across in other antique malls.   I also liked the friendliness of the vendors that were present and their helpfulness. I liked that things had information tags on them ( if they are accurate I don't know).   They have everything from antique jewelry to patio furniture and all things in between.

I've had an account for about 5 or 6  months. Today I plan to close it.  The idea of extended business hours pulled me in.  However what they don't tell you is the operate on midwestern hours so when you bank after 3pm local time things are posted as being done the next business day.   The issue I have is I saw my account was in overdraft and raced to cover it before the close of the local business day. However I was informed I would still be charged the $37 OD fee on a couple of dollars mishap.   I thought at a previous occassion that the amount was $5 or under I would not be hit with an OD fee for any bank but learned that was not the case with this bank. Today I discovered my mgmt company hacked my account to collect a $25 fee I refused to pay.  I have never paid them with bill pay. I have only hand writtenb a check or paid with a money order. TCF refuses to accept these facts and wants me to pay $32 stop payment or to allow the bill pay check to go through and then dispute it.  As I told them I am not working and $25 can create a nightmare of OD fees for me in the meantime.   My only resort is to close the account.  Cancel the legitmate bill pays I have in que and to pay my bills via a different bank account, MO or cash.  And to eat the cost of the checks I ordered when opening the account barely 6 months ago.  Along with the 3 unfair OD fees for accounting errors I tried to correct in the 1st 24 hours of noticing them. The staff is not friendly at this location andeveryone claims their hands are tied buy bank policy or the time difference when I have an issue. Also please note I can seldom get the online statements to open!  As is the case today.

First I set downstairs. Struck up a conversation with another single woman. We both set at the bar wanting white wine. The bartender knew nothing about wine or what was stocked. The hostess later provided a cheap looking but creative wine list on strips of paper. They stock a number of reds and whites but none I nor the other woman was familiar with. I prefer Chablis but they don't stock any. So I decided to try the house margarita. Listen closely.... Avoid it! It doesn't taste anything like a margarita, they serve it in their regular cocktail glass and they limit you to two of them. I could not suck it down and I can usually drink just about anything that's a cocktail that I set my mind to with a few exceptions. Mark this as a new exception.   Further more the young bartender did not know what he had on hand. I ordered a Canadian Whiskey and 7 up. He poured and tried to get me to drink a Chivas Regal & 7! The Canadian Club and Seagram Seven was in plain sight!   Our party decided to move upstairs and it took the bar 25 minutes to combine 3 tabs to be paid on one credit card!   Upstairs the waiter decides to card me! Come on I'm old enough to be your mother! He backs down. But when the other female in our party of now four orders a round of shoots for us it takes more than 30 minutes to get them. Because our waiter felt she was tipsy, I'm told when I track him down.   We looked at the menu but nothing was appealing, not even the font choice of the menu! Worst menu I have ever seen in a new establishment. If not the worst ever. Everything is overpriced. Happy hour consist of half off drinks and $1 off small plates! One dollar! Why bother?   The host/hostess furthermore kept people waiting at the door at 5pm when there was a number of tables in sight, as well as the majority of the bar. None of us understood that. The restrooms are located on the main floor only and the women's room is a major track to the entry should you need to go, so beware if you are upstairs! The upstairs is not accessible to anyone who can not climb a flight of steep stairs by the way. Many say they like the building but I personally find nothing about it appreciative. They proudly boast that it was built from the ground up for this purpose & use. Being an ex- architect student, take my opinion for free... it's a crappy design! The excessive outdoor seating is nice for a few months out of the year but soon 3/4 of their seating will be avoided due to the AZ heat or seasonal rainstorms. Also the color scheme of gray on gray isn't very inviting.   I chuck this up to been there, done that. I will not be returning. After all why?  Menu sucks, drinks sucks, service sucks, seating sucks.

I went and I was greatly disapointed. I had a simple 14" mushroom, onion and cheese pizza . It was barely 4 sliced mushrooms on the entire thing! The crust though different was not that great either. Beverages are all totally overpiced. I'm a fan of hard ciders especially Hornsby's cider. One bottle here is only .50 cheaper than a 6 pack. My simple pizza was just shy of $18!!  The host at the door just let me walk in and take a seat. she seated everyone else. I set for 7 minutes until my waiter came and then he got me a menu.   There's a survey you can take on your reciept that gives you $5 off your next visit. I wish I could just have my evening back and my money. I brought half the pizza home which was my plan to tkae it for lunch tomorrow. Nope I will wreck my 30 min lunch break with this crap!   I was hoping a homeless or street person would approach me and I could give it away, but none did.

Tried it for the first time this week. My sub was tasty but just a roastbeef and cheese sub on a cursty roll. Can't figure out what all the rage over this chain is about. It's fast service which is great when you need food fast. But it's a little over priced sandwhich and fountain drink both. My lunch was $8.  The place is clean but not really inviting as 90% of the customers take it to go or eat at an outdoor table.
