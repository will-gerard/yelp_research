I wish I could give a rating of zero stars or negative stars. I had an amazing experience at the Verizon store near the Chandler mall but they did not have the device I needed so they sent me to this location. Unfortunately for me when I arrived Jose was waiting for me at the door. This guy is a real donkey. To say he had a personality of a cinder block  would be giving him too much credit.   The place was empty and we were taken back to an area to get our business done. It was obvious from the beginning that this guy was not really interested in helping us since we were not a new sale for him. Pretty much everything we did was met with contention and a request for us to go back to the previous store since they knew how to do whatever it was we were asking him to do.  I have always experienced a pretty positive attitude at Verizon stores and a definite desire to assist me in anything I needed help with. In this case I felt like I was being rushed out the door and being told contradictory information than what I received from the Chandler mall location.  We were so frustrated that we left immediately after I was able to obtain my phone. My girlfriend decided to get a different phone solely based on the fact that she did not want to deal with this guy anymore.  do yourself a favor and drive 10 minutes down the road and get great service from the guys there.  In my case Dan and Brian save the day.

If there was a way to give negative stars I would.  The food was OK at best but the service was awful.  Rudy's was packed and this place was wide open so we thought we would give it a shot.  Now we know why the place was dead.  We wait 30 minutes for corn on the cob.  We asked multiple times for it and they finally opted to argue with us about whether we paid for it or not.  We also tried pies.  The Frys bakery pie was much better and not $17!  Do yourself a favor and to to Rudy's and wait in line.  They won't run out of food on you and the staff will be happy to serve you.
