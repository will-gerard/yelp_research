I am so lucky to have a yummy and cute restaurant like Liberty Market in my neighborhood.   I have been there quiet a few times and they never disappoint. The food is always wonderful and the service is too. The guy that works the coffee bar is so great, helpful and makes awesome almond milk lattes.   Anytime we have people visiting or someone new in town we take them over to Liberty Market. It's just one of those places everyone should try!

I have to say I have been seeing Dr Dobrusin for about 15 years and I no longer want to go to this office.   I don't have a ton of experience with Dr Dobrusin in recent years but I have had experience with the front office staff and his Nurse Practitioners.  I can't say I care for the front office staff or their lack of wanting to help. They're just not extremely kind or knowledgeable. Maybe they just don't care.   Also, he has one Nurse Practitioner who I CAN NOT STAND! She is always wearing a blue Concentra shirt and has major attitude. On one occasion she refused to give me an antibiotic. Went to the urgent care across the street from my house and they were in shock at how I was treated.   Needless to say I will be finding another doctor and won't be recommending this practice to anyone!

Just got back from a visit at Mesa Family Medical and I have to say much better!  The N.P that I didn't like is no longer at the practice and hasn't been for a while. I had a new doctor named Dr. Pine. He was wonderful. Thorough and helpful. I'm so glad they have turned their practice around.   Oh FYI they no longer accept AHCCCS.

I've been to this location a few times and I have to say it's always just ok.   Last night my husband I both had a cheeseburger and it wasn't good. Very dry and tasteless. The french fries I usually like didn't taste like much either. Pretty disappointing.   I like the chicken chopped salad a lot and I think if I ever go back I will just stick with that.

After writing the original review the company contacted me and asked me to email them and discuss what I had written in the review. I sent them an email and never heard back.   That's what I call great customer service. I won't be back.

I have been wanting to try this place for a while because I've heard good things about the food- and it didn't disappoint!  Had a buffalo chicken salad and it was great!! I will definitely come back and order that salad again.   Ordered a side of french fries and they are awesome!   Hubby had the Kobe Beef dog and scarfed it down- said he loved it! Definitely add cheese!  We will be back- close to home, good atmosphere, service was great and the food was worth driving for. Loved it!!

Me and the hubby went in while Walmart was changing the battery on our car. So not a place we sought out but more out of convenience.   We both ordered a hamburger- I had a cheeseburger and he ordered a Southwest burger. Mine was ok- over cooked, cheap bun but ok. Fries were about average but I liked them. My husband didn't like his Southwest burger at all. Said the flavor of the BBQ was too sweet and he said the patties were pre made {pet peeve for both of us} but edible.   We sat at the bar because there was only one person working the whole restaurant. He shook our hands and asked our names..? I guess they want to be the Cheers of Greenfield and Baseline.   Fine- but nothing to drive out of your way for.

I have been to Postinos quiet a few times and I have to say I'm kind of sick of it. The rude staff, the food that always gives me a tummy ache and the annoying 45 minute wait every time even when I see tables.   My best friend and I went last night and both of us woke up this morning with upset stomachs.  I just don't think I'll be back- I don't get the appeal anymore. Even though I know I'm clearly in the minority.

I haven't written a yelp review in a long time but this called for one.   Why is there so many good reviews? I don't understand what is so good here.   The iced tea is powdered, the orange juice is from a box, the water is from tap. The tables are set up in the most bizarre way it's uncomfortable.   Ordered eggs, potatoes, bacon and a side of pancakes. The potatoes were undercooked and bland. Bacon I couldn't eat as it was overcooked and cheap. The pancake was nothing to write home about.   And do they put MSG in their food?! Left with a dry mouth and headache. Will never ever return.

I really love getting my nails done at this salon. They are fast, friendly and clean. I think the prices are decent too. I definitely recommend to anyone in the area.

Just had date night with the hubby here, we've been wanting to try it because it's so close to home.    It's cute inside when you walk in. Doesn't hold a lot of people, and for a strip mall it's cute.   Ordered bruschetta trio- to be honest I hated the fig jam and prosciutto one. Yuck. The ricotta cheese and red bell pepper was ok, a little flavorless. But the caprese one was fantastic! The bread for the bruschetta was really yummy.   Had the corleone pizza- I really liked the crust and sauce but I felt like the cheese was a little cheap and the grease was abundant.   I will definitely come back and order pasta and a salad next time. It is way better than Salernos up the street.

Audra is absolutely wonderful! I go to her for my eyebrow waxes and I have to say they have never looked better. It can be so hard to find anyone you trust to wax, doesn't break you out, etc.   She is so sweet, funny and kind. I love her easy going personality and the way she decorated her salon.   I would recommend anyone go see her and you won't be disappointed! Thank you Audra!

Just had breakfast here with the hubby and I must say I like this location better than the one on Power. They are more friendly here and it's cleaner.   I had an omelette and hashbrowns and both were yummy. I actually really like their hashbrowns. Hubby had chicken fried steak and loved it.   Not gourmet food by any means but good enough to have breakfast! Will definitely come back!

I LOVE their turkey, bacon, avocado salad. One of my favorite lunches on the go.   Also, their cinnamon rolls and cookies are very good.   Sandwiches- meh. I don't think I would order a sandwich from there ever again.   The drive thru can be annoying because it can take a really long time but every time I go they forget something. Forks, napkins, the salad dressing, a straw.. Before you drive off make sure you have what you need!

I love kneaders- I really do. But DO NOT go through the drive-thru if you are in a hurry. I would say average wait time is 10 minutes.   My only complaint- other than that keep on keeping on Kneaders!

Joyride is my new favorite restaurant.   I am absolutely in love with the food, decor and their TACOS! My absolute favorite is the crispy fish taco.   We went in on my birthday and ordered an appetizer, tacos and a few sides. The tacos came out but the appetizer didn't come out until we were done eating our meal. I told the waiter how late the appetizer was, and the manager came right over and took care of the whole meal! Not at all what we were expecting but so wonderful and kind on my birthday.  Joyride is absolutely wonderful from the customer service to the great food! I love this place and go back as much as I can.

I had dinner here Sunday night with family and it was AMAZING.   It was late around 8pm and it wasn't very busy in the restaurant which was nice. We sat and had prompt chips/salsa and ordered some guacamole. The guacamole was wonderful and each of the salsas were very tasty.   My mom ordered cheese blue corn enchiladas, husband ordered the New Mexican burrito, dad ordered the green chili stew and I had stuffed sopapillas. Every one loved their food. Each plate was equally tasty and the beans and rice were so great.   I would definitely compare this food to Dicks Hideaway or Richardson's in Phoenix. I loved this restaurant. The food was so good, the service was awesome and it is close to my house. I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK.

I really enjoyed Hopdoddys.   I an Arizona Native and over 21 so I usually avoid Scottsdale in general but I liked this.  Everything tasted fresh and came out hot.   I will say that the queso was a waste of money- not very good or interesting. Next time I go I will definitely try a salad.   Will be back for sure!

Came here today and got take out with my sister. I have to say I really enjoyed it! And for take out I think that's saying something!   I ordered a Denver omelette with home fries and I really enjoyed the omelette. It was hot and pretty big. I would definitely order that again. I also ordered a side of bacon that was just so so but anymore I think most bacon is just so so.   My sister got a bagel and cream cheese and enjoyed it.   I have to say the host was so sweet and helpful. Great customer service. He was a young guy with glasses and very nice!   I'm glad I came in and I will again!

We went here again tonight to give it another try and ya know I just don't like it. I really wish I did. I feel like everything is over salted.   I had carne Asada tacos and I wish they would buy better meat. It just tasted cheap.

Just got scolded by the restaurant for being so negative about their restaurant. Professional thanks!  Not EVERYONE has to like your food!

Have only been to this salon twice. First time was good. Second time pissed me off.   Without going into too much personal detail how they did my moms, sister snd I hair and what we were charged for it is disgusting.   Stay away!

Came here for dinner tonight with mom, dad and hubby. I never would have known it was here if I didn't go to the Starbucks next door.   First impression, fun and different. Good location. A little reminiscent of Hopdoddys in Scottsdale. It is an order at the counter and go get your own food restaurant. Which I like, no waiting around for things or your drink to be refilled.   I ordered a cheeseburger and cry and fry. Sidebar: I appreciate that they put the calories on the menu. Burger was typical- tomatoes, lettuce, two patties and a smear of "special sauce".  I liked it- Not great, not bad but good. Maybe better than five guys, maybe not but comparable. (To be honest, I'm not a big fan of five guys though)   The cry and fry were actually very tasty. I really loved the onion rings, but I have to be honest the fries were way too salty. I hope they tone that down a bit.   My mama ordered a quinoa burger, I was skeptical but I actually really liked it- more than my cheeseburger. I would probably order that next time over my cheeseburger.   Hubby had hot dogs- I didn't try them but he enjoyed them.   Manager stopped by to make sure food was good- he was nice and touched base but didn't linger which I liked.   I will go back. Clean, cute, fast, close to home and a decent place to go and get exactly what you want. A burger and fries.

I was so excited to try this place and unfortunately I didn't like it.   Came here tonight with my sister. Walked in and it's cute, clean, bright and decorated really nicely. But the menus on the wall are so difficult to read! The print is too small. We were about the 5th group in line to order and waited about 20 minutes to get to the counter {it is an order at the counter and seat yourself kind of place- which I like} quite a long wait- but no worries it's new.   We ordered sweet potato fries, artichoke and spinach dip and a pear and Gorgonzola salad. The girls taking the orders were nice enough just slow moving.   We take our sit and within 30 seconds our salad and fries are out. First thing I think - ok so not fresh food. Boy was I right!   Soggy fries with a very weird almost tasteless dip. I'm gonna go ahead and say those fries were frozen. They went from warm to cold in about two minutes.   The salad was especially not impressive. The pear was mushy and bruised, cheap tasteless "Gorgonzola", a few grapes, and carrots. Dressing was ok but for $9 this was way overpriced. No cheese barely and also small, very small.   The spinach artichoke dip actually grossed me out. Comes with pita bread, carrots, cucumbers and celery. The veggies were dripping with water and again- bruised cucumber. The dip was horrible- warm not hot and just not a good taste.   It's hard to write this review for a place that I want to like so badly but the quality of food isn't there. For a restaurant that advertises fresh they may want to stop reheating their food.   1 star for decor and cleanliness. Sorry Charlie I won't be back.

So cute inside! Good service, the cupcakes were not dry and very pretty. The frosting was a little too sweet for my taste, but yummy all the same.   Try the peanut butter cookies! They were delicious! Me and the hubby will definitely stop in again and try something on one of our cheat days!

No. Just no.   So small inside. When I sat down to eat my food in the corner I felt like I was in time out. Dead on a Friday night.   Ordered the #2. Three different mini burritos. Great way to showcase three times in one visit that I don't like your food. We were told the salsas were spicy but they weren't. Chips were ok, a little salty. My burritos that had meat inside (pork and beef) were very dry. Not appetizing to me. My husband had a breakfast burrito and said they used fake eggs which is a pet peeve.   We won't go back- Rubios is around the corner with $1.50 fish tacos on Tuesdays that are actually yummy. Sorry America. I don't like the food.

Went through the drive thru on my lunch break. Only a few cars but the parking lot was packed! Maybe because it's new...? Definitely not because it's good.   Ordered a chicken Cobb salad with avocado and an iced tea. For $12 it was a little pricey. Drink is small and salad is probably an average size. I'm a little bit of an iced tea snob and I didn't like it, I don't think it was powdered but just didn't like the kind they brewed. I didn't get the salad I ordered. That's annoying to me especially in a drive thru- at lunch. I drive off thinking I get the right one and I don't have time on my lunch break to go fix it. They need to get it right. Also, they gave me a bread roll. The roll was just floating around in the bag. Not in anything, no butter, nothing. I found that very strange.  The drive thru girl was not nice or friendly to top it all off.    Will I go back? No. Will I pick Kneaders over Panera? EVERY TIME.

Went here today with my husband, mom and grandma for lunch. There is a steady stream of customers coming through the door but the line moves quickly.   Had edamame, spring rolls and spicy tuna rolls to start. The spring rolls were awesome! I would definitely order those again! Spicy tuna wasn't very spicy but it was good. And edamame was standard. Always good.   I ordered the #1 bowl but with rice instead of noodles and I really liked it. Lots of veggies and chicken and I liked the crushed peanuts on top. Mom and grandma also had that bowl but with noodles and they thought it was good. Hubby ordered curried shrimp and he loved his shrimp. We also ordered the dessert rolls {I didn't try} and everyone at the table said they were just so so.   The BEST part- I am an iced tea snob and they have 5 kinda of yummy flavored brewed iced tea. Only one was sweetened and it was with stevia {ok by me}. Tried two flavors and both were great!   I liked this place- clean and new. Service was good. We will definitely go back.

Went here Sunday afternoon for lunch and I really enjoyed my experience!   My husband and I both ordered the Mad Dog pizza and added basil, bell peppers and he added jalapeños. It was good! I liked the wood fired crust. And I liked how quick the pizza came out! Also, I didn't know this going through the first time but they don't charge for additional toppings so definitely get what sounds yummy to you! I know this is a weird thing to enjoy about a restaurant but I really liked their ice- weird compliment I know.   I will definitely return for a quick and yummy lunch and to chomp on the ice!

I loved this bakery. So cute inside and the staff was helpful. The cinnamon roll and the cookie with everything in it were my favorite. So excited to have this in my neighborhood.
