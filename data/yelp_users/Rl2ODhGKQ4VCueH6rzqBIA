The husband and I went on a Friday night for a romantic dinner and really liked the place!  The service was great, the ambiance straight out of a Soprano's episode and the food was delicious.  We especially loved the crab cakes!  We even had dessert - the cheesecake was pretty good.

Ok, let's be completely honest. Chandler does not have the greatest sushi restaurant selection.  We've tried several non-chain restaurants in the area with a sense of defeat and remorse being the shared feeling of the group at recounting our ordeal.   However, when visiting Ninja Japanese, we were pleasantly surprised.  Truth be told - if compared with the best of the best sushi and teppanyaki places on the planet Earth, it would fall mid to bottom of the scale (authenticity and fresh out of the water tasty goodness with the perfect pairings and accompaniments is truly hard to find).  BUT if you are in the east valley, this is definitely worth a visit!  We were big fans of the following:  * FANTASTIC SERVICE.  Our waiter (I WISH I could remember his name for a proper shout-out) was amazing - attentive, professional, prompt and knowledgeable of the menu's choices.  What else could you ask for? * YUMMY SUSHI ROLLS, SASHIMI & SAKE.  Everything we ordered tasted fresh and delicious.  Again, I wish I could remember exactly what we ordered (too much sake maybe).  We did take the waiters suggestions on a few selections and they didn't disappoint.  A non-sushi believer in our group even ordered a chicken teriyaki plate that they seemed to enjoy very much as well.  * UPBEAT/MODERN ATMOSPHERE.  There was fun music playing in the background, clean and contemporary decor and although you could definitely wear a nice top and jeans, I felt completely comfortable in my dress and heels.    We'll be back!

I have had the opportunity to visit Aji Spa twice and and wish I could come every week!    Pros: * The atmosphere: Native American decor surrounds you in the lounges, pool area and throughout.  VERY Arizonian if you have out of town guests who could use a spa day.  Bathrooms, public areas, spas, steam room, etc. are all kept very clean. * The staff: From the front desk to the attendants to the masseuse - EVERYONE is kind and calm and very welcoming.  Even to the non-regulars such as myself. * Amenities: Private jacuzzi, co-ed pool area, co-ed lounge, private lounge, steam room, ample space in locker rooms, showers, private bathrooms. * Trail mix: Yes. I said trail mix. They have this complimentary trail mix available by their teas and water in the lounge and it is soooo good! A wasabi mix with just the right spice and salt... I can't fully explain - go try it!  Cons: * My only complaint is that they close the adjoining cafe hours before the spa closes.  We had an afternoon appointment and couldn't order anything conveniently.  However, the resort itself DOES have other dining choices within walking distance for before and after your spa treatment.  PS. When scheduling a massage, I highly recommend Johnny! He is AH-MA-ZING!!!!  Experienced, professional and just overall WONDERFUL!

As far as Peter Piper Pizza's go, this one is pretty awesome!  Yes, you have the kids running around everywhere.  Yes, you lack gourmet pizza.  But, uh, HELLO.  It's Peter Piper Pizza.  I happen to like (not love) the pizza here, maybe it stems from it being rooted in me as a child.    Anytime we go dining with children under 13 in tow, this is always a great choice.  The kids eat, they play, they tire themselves out and they come home with a bunch of cheap crap they bought with their tickets that cost me triple what it would of cost at the dollar store with regular grown-up money versus tokens and tickets. Anyhow.....  I'm a fan of this particular location because:  1) The place is spacious enough that you are not run down by little people on your way to pick up your order.  2) They keep tables, play areas and restrooms very clean. 3) Service is satisfactory. 4) Play area, arcade games, carousel are all in great condition - nothing torn, falling apart or borderline condemned like other Peter Piper restaurants. 5) They have several 32 inch TV's hanging in case you want to catch a particular game while the kids are playing. 6) And, again, the pizza is really not that bad.

If you are looking for great tacos de pastor (comparable to what you can find in Mexico border cities), then look no further.  They are muy, pero muy DELICIOSOS!  The menudo offered on the weekends is great as well (perfect hangover or cold remedy)!  This is one of the best grab & go spots in town or you could eat inside if you are not planning on staying very long as it is small and sometimes tends to get very crowded.    Warning to those who are scared of sketchy neighborhoods.  You will probably be asked for change in the parking lot and you might run into a gangster or two.  :)  Just beware, the tacos are soo worth it!    If you want a great burrito, a simple bean, cheese and carne asada will satisfy your craving.    Would have given the place 5 stars but there is no inside bathroom and their horchata is not ALWAYS up to par (try the Jamaica drink, though).  Also, bring cash - there is a fee for paying with debit/credit card.

Absolutely no service other than taking my money at the register and my change wasn't even counted out. Won't be back unless I'm returning what I bought. Will go to my other Big 5 on Ocotillo or go to a completely different sporting goods store to spend my money.

We visited this location for the first time this weekend (had been to the Caffe Boa on Elliot, but there is no relation -anymore- and the menus are completely different).    We decided to take advantage of a Group On and ate from their  weekend brunch menu.  The menu seemed a bit limited at first (due to the time of day and only brunch being available) but it ended up being the yummiest and more original eats we've had in a while!  We ate the Mediterranean Omelet and Friuli Bennedict and both tasted GREAT!  Everything was apparently made with fresh and quality ingredients!  We also had a pitcher of their fantastic white sangria!    The waitress was extremely helpful, friendly and service was overall an A+!  We will definitely be returning, GroupOn or not. :)

Wow.  What a difference from their downtown Chandler location (which is now closed).   Service and food was just B-A-D.    1.  We called to confirm the hours online and they weren't correct (closed earlier).  In retrospect, we should not have called, to not hurry up and miss out on this painful experience.    2.  The waitress didn't make it to our table for 15 minutes after we were seated and didn't frequent our table to serve us.  We were wondering where she was since the place was dead with only an hour until closing time.  When she did come to take our order it was apparent she was eating her dinner.  Her mouth was full as she tried speaking to us and she even accidentally spit out some of her food on my arm as she leaned over to read our menu.  GROSS.  We should have walked out then but I thought, "Hey, everyone has to eat at some point, right? And accidents/mistakes happen, right?" Eww, my stomach still turns thinking about it. The few times she came out to check on us she was STILL eating while trying to talk.  Her breath stunk of something gross (have mercy, why did she have to get so close?).  Ok, I can go on and on but I'll stop for the sake of anyone eating and reading at the same time.  3.  The rolls and sashimi were NOT good.  Extremely fishy tasting.  We even ordered one of their cooked rolls and it was so mushy and warm (not hot or cold - the safe temps) - we didn't even finish it. And what is up with macadamia nuts on most of the rolls described in the menu, yet they don't serve them because of allergies?  I completely understand allergen precautions - but why even list it on your menu?  Oh, Sushi Eye, we celebrated birthdays, had grand old times and really digged your old location.  Why, oh why must it end like this?  :'o(

The great thing about this place is their carne asada burrito!  Everything else is average.  We've tried different burritos and other menu items and they were just ok.  The last two times we've been here, they've gotten our order wrong and were NOT apologetic - to the point that I feared they might do something to my food for having to correct it.  :0/    Anyhow, if they had better service (maybe a smile or a greeting or a thank you at some point - or how about they just get our order right?), and we just eat carne asada burritos, this place would get a solid three stars.    Come on, Chandler/Gilbert.... can I get some good fast-food Mexican spots?!  One thing I did notice was that they're open pretty late which would definitely be convenient after a late-night!

First, I'll start by saying that Home Depot is one of my favorite stores of all time.  I can spend HOURS in one without even realizing it.  I've been to many and have loved them all - everyone is so friendly and helpful.  And I am a sucker for great customer service - especially when you're spending lots of money.    That being said, I was not impressed here.  My visit happened early Tuesday morning and the store was not very crowded.  The first employee I ran into was VERY helpful. And that's where the customer service ended.  I hunted around for someone to help me with my flooring questions.  I knew exactly what I needed and just had a couple of questions on measurement calculations. The person who was supposed to be the "expert" in that department had absolutely no idea how to answer any of my questions and had to finally call someone on the phone to answer - a "pro", he was called.  I asked if the "pro" could be the one to help me instead as my special order was going to cost over $300.  I was denied the "pro's" assistance.  All my questions were answered with "probably" and "I think".  The most definite answer I could get was "I'm pretty sure".  The store rep finally placed the order for a piece of flooring that was too big for what I needed, which would of made my floor boards completely uneven.  Yikes!  I ended up cancelling the order and going to Floor & Decor instead.    I'll be back to Home Depot for other things.  Just not that one.  The store was not crowded and there were no wait times at the registers, most likely because this location is so far southeast.  If you know exactly what you are looking for, do not need ANY assistance and are in a hurry, this would probably be a great location for you.

I am a current Sprint customer.  The service at this store when I arrived to question my upgrade and choices was not up to par.   First off, I was YELLED AT (not told) that someone will be right with me as soon as I walked in, almost as if it was just something that needed to be said and crossed off the list versus a genuine statement.  But, whatever, right?  I nodded, smiled, and walked around the store and waited patiently.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.    And as the other customer that was there before me was being helped, I noticed that the store looked friggin AWESOME!  I played with all the phones, checked out their really cool displays, read some literature.  Then, my stomach was reeeally growling and I realized I was still waiting.  When I looked up the associate who had yelled at me earlier, I saw she was joking around with the customer and talking about an "apartment"?  That's when I stood and stared in disbelief, hoping she would notice me and possibly care that I was there for business and not social fulfillment.  She did not notice.  She kept on talking.    At that point I decided to just walk out and go to another Sprint store that I knew would give me better service, even if it was a further drive.  Or maybe that Verizon store .......

We LOVE this park AND rec center!  We've used everything from the sand volleyball court to the great jogging trails to the playground area.    The playground has a great little section for tiny toddlers as well as school-aged children.  Their barn-yard themed ramadas are perfect for little birthday parties - they even have large sized ramada areas for bigger parties. But book months in advance, because they're pretty booked - especially in Spring.  We were unable to hold one two weeks before we needed it.    The recreation center has a great area(s) for pre-teens (fully equipped with video games, basketball court, computers, etc.) and a day care center which is videotaped and shown on monitors throughout the gym upstairs for parents.  This park and recreation center is definitely a perk of being a Chandler resident!

I have long, layered hair and am extremely paranoid about getting haircuts in unknown places.  I first tried this location after my regular stylist at a different AZ Hair Co. had moved out of state.  I've been to extremely expensive salons - $100+ for a hair cut - and inexpensive salons from $15-45 for a hair cut.  I have been disappointed, I've cried, I've screamed and at last gave a huge sigh of relief when finding this salon.  :)  ANYHOW....  This location ROCKS.  The price is only $15 for a cut & shampoo.  I see Star every single time and she NEVER disappoints.  She is extremely professional and talented.  I've gotten different cuts throughout the past 2 years from her and her consults and styles are always PERFECT!  My entire family now goes to her - I'm talking kids, parents, friends.... and they ALL absolutely love her.  I've gotten my hair cut by a couple other stylists at this location as well and they've also been great - but Star is by far my fave.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!

I really wanted to like this place.  The waitress was super friendly.  The patio seating was ideal with a beautiful evening patio view.  But when it really comes down to it, the food and drinks were the main reason my friend and I visited the place.  We decided to start off with some sake bombers, a Vegas roll and some freshwater eel.  Then, everything turned sour... *  It took about 30 minutes to get our food, which seemed a bit long considering there were not many other diners.  Thankfully, we had good conversation going while we waited.  *  They were out of Sapporo beer (my fave with sake).   *  Our Vegas roll was soooo greasy, I forced myself to have 2 pieces (thinking it was maybe just the first one). We noticed the plate had a pool of oil/grease where the pieces we had eaten had been placed.  We couldn't even eat the freshwater eel or the remainder of the Vegas roll because we were so grossed out.  We simply drank the remainder of our drinks, paid our bill, left a tip (the waitress was very nice and it wasn't her fault the food was so horrible, right?) and left to another bar/restaurant hoping it would redeem our wasted money/time the beginning part of the night.  I did mention we did NOT want to finish our sushi because it was so greasy.  The waitress simply apologized and took the food away.  I kind of felt something more on the behalf of the restaurant should have happened?  But maybe that's just me and what I would have done.  We will NOT be coming back and are in search of a local sushi restaurant that is up to par.  Will let you know if/when we find one! :)

Wellll.... I would not normally be reviewing a Walmart as I can't STAND Walmart (imagine that).  HOWEVER, I had to give a quick thumbs up to this location I stumbled upon in my quest to check off the random items on my shopping list because...  A) There were NO lines!!  Multiple cash registers were open!  I was in and out in a jiffy. B) I saw not ONE person's butt crack or smell any bad body odor!  C) The people that worked there actually seemed happy and were extremely helpful and friendly - from the greeter to produce to the cashier.  D) Product was neat and in place and aisles were clean!

Pita of the month = great value!!!  Had the chicken pesto pita and it was very delicous and fresh.  Food was prepared quickly and the fries were bomb!  Not too much room for dining (hence, the title Express), but just enough. Will be back again, for sure.

First, let me start off by saying my toddler DETESTS hair cuts.  He kicks, screams, cries and swears we're dragging him into a live horror film in action.  I've had to sit him on my lap while I sit in the barber chair myself acting as a human strait jacket, unsure of why I didn't just let him grow those Bob Marley dreads and avoided this altogether.   That being said, we've tried ALL of the "kid" haircut salons where they offered movies, video games, bubbles, other kids, a vast selection of candy..... and he didn't give a hoot. He still wanted out, stat.  At the end of each ordeal, we were left with a horrible haircut (because he wouldn't stop moving) and having to shell out about $30 for something that everyone politely stared and smirked at afterwards.  :-/  Let me tell you, I was relieved, grateful and shocked that I found this place.  What originally lured me in was the low price - around $12, almost half of what their competitors were asking.  I thought, "Well, if I'm going to end up with the same botchy cut, I might as well pay less for it". The stylist we got was Rosa.  She was/is AMAZING! Simply the nicest person who has cut his hair so far, with sooo much patience and understanding of his fears.  She never rolled her eyes or demonstrated any intolerance as other places had.  She talked to him softly, showed  him all the tools - clippers, combs.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't an instant miracle.  The first time there, he was still going bezerk. But the experience overall was much better. We've been there four times now, and he finally sits in the race car barber chair and only puts up a minimal fight.    The other stylists there are also very friendly each time we're there. And there seem to always be other people coming in, so making an appointment beforehand is definitely advised.  Also, Rosa has been able to cut all the modern styles - traditional fade, eurohawk, mohawk, you name it. It's always resulted in exactly what we wanted/described to her. She even makes suggestions on how it would look better and how to style it.   While the overall look of the salon is not as commercial and put together as the big, well-known chains of children salons, I don't mind one bit when I can get this kind of service and my kid is happy.

Walking into this establishment, I was quite impressed at how clean and polished they appeared.  That impression did not last long when everyone that was there before me was attended to first and the front desk informed me that my waxer was running at least 10-minutes behind.  This concerned me since my appointment was at 5:30p.m., it was now 5:35p.m., and the place closed at 6:00p.m.  I told the front desk that I was on a tight schedule and needed to step outside to check on my husband & baby (who were waiting at the establishment next door).  When I stepped back in a few minutes later (no more than 3-4 minutes!), the front desk informed me that my waxer had closed down her station (really? in 3 minutes?) and "Did you want to set an appointment for tomorrow?".  Uh, no. No, I wouldn't. Epic fail, E.W.C.  Epic fail.    The fact that they can't respect a customer's time and give horrible service gives them a negative 2 star rating (but Yelp does not give that option, so I'm giving you a 1 star).  Did I mention that I saw the front desk laughing hysterically with the waxer (who was able to leave early due to my cancellation) through the window as I was getting in my car? :-/  Talk about adding insult to injury.

Great choices of flavors (my favorite is a combo of chocolate & banana split)! Good toppings, also.    GREAT place for kids! They have a board and dry-erase markers that can keep them occupied after they devour their froyo and you're still indulging in yours.  They even have a TV playing video of customer pics - ones that you can take yourself in the shop's own webcam. Also a kid favorite.   Clean environment, helpful staff. :)

After a horrible experience at EWC's Gilbert location (Val Vista & Baseline), I decided to give EWC one more try - especially since one of my good friends swears by them (in CA) and I get my hair styled right next door to their location in Tempe.  I am sooo glad I did!  The front desk administrator at this Tempe location was AWESOME - extremely friendly and helpful and was able to get me in the same day.  My waxer - Alison - was superb!  She was very knowledgeable, professional and pleasant!  I will definitely be back! I would suggest to anyone going to the Gilbert/Chandler location that an extra travel time to the Tempe location is well worth it.

Great little find in downtown Chandler! Have not made it for happy hour yet, but definitely plan on doing so!  The Goods:   *THE FOOD! OMG, THE FOOD! Quality ingredients and authentic flavors. Many gluten free choices. Howevwr, if you suffer from Celiac disease, do not order the fried items noted GF as they're fried in the same oil as non-GF items. We have tried several items. My favorite being the summer rolls, Thai lettuce wraps (not your basic wraps. They do pack a little kick and a phenomenal citrus flavor. Think Mariscos mixed with PF Changs and then taken up a couple levels in awesomeness), and the Massamun curry (those short ribs are AHH-mazing, and the curry sauce...my mouth is watering just thinking about it). And I LOVE that they custom spice your food! "How hot do you want it?" Oh, VERY hot, young man!     *Nice but casual ambience. I wore a nice dress for dinner because we were going out afterwards and I did not feel overdressed. However, I've also been here before with jeans and sandals and was equally comfortable.  *Friendly, unpretentious service. Waiters are very nice and genuinely helpful.   The Bads:  *Chill, maybe too chill service. While very nice service, do NOT come in if you're trying to eat and run. They do sometimes take a little long bringing you drinks or taking your order. But if you're in good company and not starving to death, the time passes quickly. Oh, and fair warning, if you order something spicy, do ask the waiter for extra water because waiting for them to refill your glass while your mouth is on fire may not be too attractive if you're on a hot date! Once, they fine tune the attentiveness of they're wait staff, this will definitely be a 5-star type of place!  Tip: Stop in for an after dinner cup of joe next door at Peixoto. Sometimes they have live music on weekends. Their cascara tea (cold or hot) is good too!

GREAT find in downtown Chandler. Almost missed it as I was walking towards Vintage 95. I'm glad I didn't!  Classy bar and a definite must if you are in the area and thirsty. Here's why:  - Throwback decor mixed with a little hipster... super cool. - Fantastic mixologists with great service and craft cocktail skills (which also means, customer must have parience and not expect a 30 second turnaround on a drink order). Oh, must mention: they're dressed like classic bartenders.. bests, ties, well-groomed. No sloppiness here, ladies and gents! - Drink menu and top shelf choices were fabulous. - Management involvement on the floor and engagement with customers and doing what you dont see many managers do nowdays.... managing!  - Pricing for cocktails is very reasonable considering all the work and quality ingredients involved. Not bad at all!   At about a 4.25 star rating right now as the place is still fine tuning all the last details. We'll be back and prety sure they will be higher on the scale if they just keep doing what they're doing.  Can't wait to partake in more menu choices!
