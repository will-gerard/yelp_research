I literally didn't even walk in the door when they turned me away because my clothes were in bags . Apparently they need to already be on hangers **** My high end dresses and designer clothes will find a happier home somewhere else . I am a business owner so I know if you have requirements there are much better ways to handle situations , an example ; saying hello first to a customer might be a start . Maybe even letting my daughter and I get in from the 100*  heat and explaining your protocol while examining what you'd like me to bring back is just a suggestion because I care that customer service should be priority in a mom & pop business .

My daughter was so upset when her friend dropped and shattered her phone on accident . We brought it over to Mobile Matters the next day and within 30 minutes it was like she had a brand new phone . It was also very convenient to be able to leave the phone while we walked around Desert Ridge .
