In LOVE with the crispy chicken salad! Since I work at the mall and only have 30 minute breaks the servers are extremely understanding and speedy with my order! They always remember my face and I always feel very welcome! Such hard workers over there and LOVE the outcome. If your looking for a fun place to eat come here! Even at their busiest they have to dance to songs that come on for guests entertainment. One word "Bravo!"

Lani was really good! I had a difficult design and she was so patient not to mention very gentle with the tools!

I just went for the first time last weekend and it was incredible! I had a BLAST. So unique in that people of all ages (over 21 of course) are all there and unify on the dance floor! I was amazed by all of the incredible dancers and was pleased that the line dances were easy to pick up for a newbie like myself. If you get the chance get a group together and go:) Also on Fridays before 11 I believe some drinks are 59 cents:) after 11 ladies get free admission!

I ONLY have wonderful things to say about this place! I am a college student at ASU and have a huge desire for great sushi at a price that doesn't break the bank! It is worth the drive! They are extremely fast with great customer service more often than not they offer you complementary dishes and each time it might be something new! If you don't eat much of something because you didn't like it they will take it off your tab and you don't even have to ask! The sushi is beyond amazing! I love eel in sushi and they have plenty of great options!

If you are looking at reviews in your car deciding where to go, DONT GO HERE. Went for a fill, the man didn't do anything I asked, I now have sharp crooked nails. One of my nails has pink on it because I asked him to cover a crack he made and he put a pink color on it that is now on my white and looks terrible (Went in for a simple french) He didn't even remove all the glitter from my last pedicure. On top of that he accidently cut my skin 3 times. Not a good experience at all. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else.

Great service! Great price! Love this place and will only come here! They don't give you any grief for paying with a card! My nail tech was a man who was very gentle with the tools so I didn't get nicked and he was also a perfectionist and my nails look great! The sms gel which they claim is healthier looks great and was only $35 not bad! I will for sure be a regular!

Alright so starting out here as The Domain and now Boulevard 1900 (we are now under new management but I still think the reviews from The Domain are worth a read) I loved it when I started here however move in day was terrible because there really wasn't much help, I was lucky I have a family of 4 to help but I recommend you bring a big bin from home depot because they only had a couple others were using. I was lucky to be on the 3rd floor because the elevator was constantly full so my family took the stairs. NOW the thing that I DO NOT like is that maintenance can enter your apartment whenever and without any warning. My roommate this morning at 9am was woken up by a very loud Spanish speaking lady who was cleaning a room next to her (our former roomie moved out) I called the office and said "listen this is frightening and all around not very polite is there anyway you can call us to warn us when this will happen so we don't think it is an intruder?" I was told that a loud knock is our warning and The next two mornings this was going to happen but there isn't a way to call us in advanced because she doesn't know when they will do that. (Odd they don't have a schedule for these things) That wasn't the first time either, sometimes we will be given 48 hour inspection notices and when my inspector knocked extremely loud I was buttoning my shirt as I walked to the door and before I got to it he just opened up the door with his own key. So think about all of this before moving in! I love the price, the 24 hour gym, the study rooms and my room personally but I also thought this would be "my place" and I would have some privacy in my own apartment. I won't be living here next semester, I want to pay for something that is actually mine and not somewhere I am babysat. I am capable of cleaning, answering doors, and following rules without breaking household items. I know some students ruin this for the rest of us but all if these procedural check ins need more order and to be professionally conducted.
