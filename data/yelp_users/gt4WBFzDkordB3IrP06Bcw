Not worth a re-visit.  If you're going to charge $13.50 for 5 pieces of sashimi, I'd like to be a hell of lot more tender and THICK..not the paper thin slices I was served.

Been here twice now...super yummy!  I'm tried their garlic eggplant - added chicken, orange chicken and fried rice... can't remember what my friends had but they all enjoyed their meals!  Definitely worth the drive :)

Great to see Harvey getting rave reviews.  I also chose his services over others since it was better priced and Harvey seemed to be easy to work with...came very prepared with ideas and tons of great options.  Why 2 stars?  Because he can't handle a disappointed client with grace and hung up on me...  Story:  I let him know that I needed the blinds in time for a dinner I was hosting - about 10 days... he said that would be doable since it normally takes 5 to 8 business days to get it ordered and installed.  On the 8th business day, I had to follow up and was told that the blinds were JUST being shipped that day... needless to say - the blinds showed up a week later than I had expected and when I called to express frustration, Harvey hangs up on me.  Who does that?  hangs up on a client because they are upset... First! I didn't get a call to let me know the blinds were being delayed and 2) NO ONE gives an estimate on shipment (not install)... which is what he claims he did... I speak English quite well and if I let you know the time I need the blinds, that is the time I expect them installed..NOT shipped.  When the blinds finally did install - took 5 hours to put it up which is was a bit much but they all fit great!  I did like that Harvey's assistant followed up to make sure everything was installed right.

Pathetic service. Read my tips.  Two waiters - an assistant and the "main" slow poke of the hour.  Reservations at 8:15pm... left the restaurant at 10:36pm...missed a show.  Reservations were made for 8:15pm... got seated promptly.  Ordered drinks and our food around 8:25pm... complimentary bread didn't arrive until 8:46pm... followed by our drink at 9pm.    That's 45 minutes and we are still waiting for our food ordered 20 minutes ago.  9:20pm - Food arrived:  Rib Eye ordered well done - received med rare.. we were too hungry to wait another hour for a re-do.  Scallops for $36 looked pathetic, tough and over cooked...6 super tiny pieces scattered on a ridiculously large plate.    Salmon was decent and the steak appetizer was also alright.  What pissed me off was no one checked on our table after delivering the food until AFTER we've finished... we ordered dessert because we bought this groupon that required us to spend $200 to make it worth our while.  coffee took 10-15 minutes to arrive... dessert came AFTER we were done with our coffee... and they didn't even ask if we wanted more.  Dinner and dessert fiasco was done by 10pm but we didn't get our check until 10:30pm (that was because I walked up to the host and asked him to get us our check)...  that totally pissed me off because there were only 2 other tables in the room with customers..   Not worth the money... you can eat better at a buffet... not impressed with the food.

I was very happy with my session with Terri.  Was a personal and sincere experience.  I would recommend her to anyone looking for someone who truly does have a special gift to help you confirm or guide you in case you need it.  :)

Great place for unique frames. Owner Sabina was very helpful and the turn around is pretty quick.  Quality of frames and lenses were impressive.   Great place to visit several times a year if you are shopping around.. they are always doing designer trunk shows and have new designs come in frequently.

My first experience with a designer and although Michelle is a great person, easy to get along with... I felt I overpaid for what I got.    The expectation was that she would just decorate the first floor of my new home in 2 weeks time...the challenge was accepted yet 6 weeks later, lack of communication and always to have to follow up every few days on progress... I didn't get done half of what I expected to accomplish.  My first and definitely last time paying for someone to help me decorate.
