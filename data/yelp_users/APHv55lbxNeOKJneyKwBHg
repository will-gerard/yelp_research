I recently moved to Phoenix and was looking for an affordable but good salon near my house.  I must say that my expectations are a lot higher than the average person, so I was pleasantly surprised at the job NICOLE did on my hair.  She used her amazing color line and mixed up the perfect shade of level 9 blonde with level 8 lowlights.  I have had numerous compliments and the color.  Not to mention, she is warm and personable.  I also sent my cousin to her and she loved her highlights.  The best part is the rates are incredibly reasonable.  Give her a try.

I would have given this business 5 stars if I hadn't had to call the office a few days later to find out where my labs were to be done.  The office manager, Mindy, was so rude, that I cannot imagine ever returning to this office.  As a business owner, I cannot imagine treating my paying patients this way and ever expecting to retain business.  I called initially to ask where my appointment was--the receptionist transferred me to someone in the back office and it went straight to voicemail.  Because my appointment was scheduled for this morning, I immediately called back to try and get a live human being to tell me where to go.  This time, Mindy (supposedly the manager) answered.  When I told her I was previously transferred to voicemail and needed to speak to someone since my appointment was only 1 hour away, she immediately told me to "calm down".  At this point, I was 100% calm and didn't need to be "calmed down".  She proceeded to get on her pedantic high horse and repeat several times that she needed more information which I was ready to give her but she was too busy trying to prove a point instead of allowing me to respond.  At this point, I lost my cool.  I am paying her salary with my overpriced $1200 a month insurance plan.  Why is it ok to treat a patient this way?  She then told me she wasn't going to help me and was going to transfer me to voicemail--knowing full well that my appointment was in an hour.  I was shocked that I had set aside time out of my day for this important appointment and she was not going to help.  I decided to call back, hoping to get another receptionist.  Nope. There was Mindy again who immediately recognized my voice and immediately began ripping me, the patient, a new one.  I hung up and called their Avondale location to get the information.  They promptly and courteously helped me in 1 minute's time.  I will never step foot in this office again until they have assured me this employee is gone.  On a positive note, I love the PA I saw there and am frustrated that I now have to go elsewhere for care.

I have to update this review because shortly after my horrible experience with their manager, both the office manager and the lead Doctor called personally to apologize and invite me back in.  I really appreciate this small act of customer attention and as a result will try them again.  I loved the PA who initially saw me, so hopefully this was just a bump in the road.

There are so few restaurants that aren't chains in Peoria it's nice to find an original like this place. Their food is fresh, authentic and delicious. The chicken kebab was fabulous and so are there gyros... The only thing they could do better really is to enhance their Greek salad dressing. It's not tangy enough for me... Other than that this place is a winner.

The subs are fantastic but the customer service is even better. The employees are always friendly and happy to accommodate. Highly recommend.

Great little dive with the best donuts in town.  A true gem.  The owners are up at the crack of dawn each morning to make these donuts from scratch.  I love supporting local business and this is one worth the effort.

Whoa.  I am thoroughly impressed with this doctor, his staff and his office. Definitely a boutique setting. Gorgeous office, not flashy or overstated. Very thorough work. Very invested in his patients.  I would definitely recommend these people.  I accidentally came upon this office while getting a cosmetic procedure next-door. I am more than pleased with the outcome. Found my new dentist!!!

Wow!  Where do I begin.  We went there with intentions of having their pizza but their menu looked so fabulous that we ended up trying variety of different dishes.  Not a single one of them disappointed. We started off with a stuffed shrimp appetizer on bruschetta which was absolutely delicious. Then I enjoyed a seafood linguine although I can't remember the exact name of it. It was superb. My daughter had lasagna which was above average... Very good. And my friend had a chicken pesto lasagna which was very rich but extremely delicious. My youngest kids had a ricotta/pepperoni stuffed calzone and it was delicious.  We finished with Italian donuts -- (a solid five stars on those) and enjoyed "Coke light" and Pellegrino's with the kids.  It's my new favorite place in the West Valley. We will definitely be back.

I really want to like this hospital.   I  have given it three chances now. I would just say that in general their nursing staff is sub par (not to mention the bathroom was super dirty in my SHARED room). Their nursing supervisors have been great but their staff training is severely lacking. My newborn was admitted to Banner Thunderbird Hospital in January 2016 for 10 days with whooping cough and I could see the contrast in nursing staff so clearly. It was day and night in terms of knowledge and taking ownership of their patients.  My first experience was having a C-section in February 2016. My uterus would not contract and I began hemorrhaging. The nurse did not respond when I told her I was in extreme pain. Finally after expelling three large blood clots and screaming for my life, the nurse supervisor came to my rescue and within minutes 5 nurses and my doctor came to my aid.  I truly believe I was minutes away from death and they couldn't get my pain under control until it was all over.  It was far worse pain than childbirth ever was.    Call me crazy, but the reason I came back to this hospital is because my doctor had privileges here and I really loved my gynecological oncologist. There weren't any surgical openings at Thunderbird so I agreed to come here for my hysterectomy.  Once again, the nurses were not prepared when a life-threatening emergency arose. I had an allergic reaction to the narcotic ( Dilaudid) they gave me after surgery and I told the nurse I couldn't breathe and my heart was slowing as I was going in and out on consiousness.  The nurse just sort of stood there.   Luckily my husband took charge and went and bought a supervisor nurse. He was amazing and immediately ordered fluids and a cardio test but it scares me to think that if my husband hadn't been there, the other nurse wouldn't have handled it properly.    Both times we had to initiate getting help over and above their standard nurses.    I must have some guardian angels because somehow I am still here.

I'm never loyal to nail salons but Mai at Top Notch is beyond amazing.  She gives THE best foot massages and my nails literally have never looked better.  I use gel polish.  I am in the beauty industry myself and I'm very particular.  I won't be going anywhere else.

This is truly a high-class establishment. The people are well-mannered and Dr. Whalen is kind, considerate and extremely knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this office to anyone... In a time when most doctors rush you in and out, they take the time to explain and make you feel like a customer should feel.  I would trust their judgment with nearly 100% confidence.

These guys are great.  I've used them on numerous occasions for various problems with my pool pump and vacuum.  They are reasonably priced and get the job done quickly and efficiently. I highly recommend them.

If you are someone who treasures long-term relationships and love to feel welcome and pampered at your salon, this is the place for you!  From the minute I walked in the door, I felt an inviting and welcoming atmosphere that is foreign to so many businesses.  From the 30 year veterans on her staff, to the newbies, Michelle's will become a part of you and you won't look back.  I love Tenille, and Missy as far as hair goes--and the facials by Linda are the bomb.

Love this place!  I go there at least once a week for their fabulous tacos and empanadas.  The best fast food joint around.

I absolutely love this place. It is clean, quick service and excellent food. It's nice to have a Chinese restaurant in town that has more ambience and better quality food. I highly recommend it.  Loved everything we ordered--including the fish dishes--which we'd never done at a Chinese restaurant.  Definitely worth getting adventurous over.
