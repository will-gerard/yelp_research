BRIDES BEWARE!!! I bought my wedding dress here, and they almost ruined my wedding day. I paid full price for a pretty expensive dress. I had to argue with them that I wanted my dress to be ordered to my specific measurements. They wanted to just order it in a standard size. Since I have very wide hips and a slim top I had to order a dress size up. I was told my dress would be in within 10 weeks. It was then delayed an additional 4 due to my "ordering so far in advance of my wedding" - so let me get this straight, since I ordered my dress with plenty of time you are telling me I get my dress delayed? They were HORRIBLY rude every time I called in for an update on what was going on. Once the dress finally arrived it had a massive hole in the lace, right in the center of the stomach. I was told to not worry about it they had a great seamstress that could patch it. UMMMMM you don't "patch" lace. They had they audacity to also tell me she had reasonable rate, as if I was going to be charged for this "service". I about lost it - the woman just continued telling me to calm down I was over reacting. I literally had to start crying to get them to do anything. I hate making a scene but she was not about to help until I did. The service is just the pond scum of the world here - please avoid it at all cost. Most bridal shops with match another shops price please shop around and do not let them put a dark cloud on your day!

The Ruben is out of this world! My husband and I got a Ruben with onion rings and a Italian grinder with fries to split. The bread on the grinder was awesome but both of us thought the Ruben was WAY better. The onion rings were basic but good and the fries were definitely above standard fries.   The person at the door who sat us was great! We had our 2 year old daughter and asked for a booth. There was not one free at the time. As soon as one emptied he hustled to get it bussed and asked if we wanted to move. That is going above and beyond!  I wanted to give 5 stars but we had a couple snags. One we ordered a large OJ but got a small and one of our sandwiches came out wrong. Our server was apologetic and got it fixed quickly on both accounts. Maybe she was just having an off day. Nothing that would keep us from coming back again and again. Hopefully our timing was just off and next time we will update to the full 5 stars.  Did I mention you should try the Ruben?

This was our first time to this place and we could not be more impressed! Our server Dyllan was a rock star making sure our experience was perfect. We tried the green chili tamale to start with our prickly pear and Acapulco margaritas. The prickly pear was a bit sweet for my taste but my husband LOVED it! I had a combo chili relleno and red chili beef soft taco EXCELLENT. Husband had the burrito enchilada style - also really great. Dyllan came over to offer spicier salsa and make sure everything was wonderful. We were pleasantly taken back  and will certainly be visiting again.

This place was simply amazing! We came here for my husband's birthday and they treated us like royalty! I love when you can sit down and enjoy a dinner without feeling like your server is trying to "turn the table". Our server was in no rush at all, but not in a bad way. We were seated promptly and pour glasses of ice water. Our table was unbelievably freezing. Since most restaurants in the summer are cold I had brought a pashmina, but it was just not enough. The server immediately noticed my discomfort and adjusted the thermostat. That is really attentive! We had an appetizer of calamari which was good, but pretty standard. For our salads my husband had the one with blue cheese which was good and I the caprese which was really awesome! Then came the highlight..... for our meals my husband had the veal parmigiana which he loved until he tasted my Veal Piemontese that was an explosion!!! I would definitely dine here again!

Most friendly donut shop ever! Our first time here and we were bewildered by the choices. The ladies were so helpful and kind by our indecision. The "specialties" are a little pricey at $1.89 each but they are HUGE! Can't wait to rip into these guys. They also have a few samples out to help you decide.

This company seems to mostly buy out other lenders loans. They will just send you a letter in the mail that appears to be junk mail and you have to hope you don't toss it. No real contact from the company, just give us our money and leave us alone. You have to go through a maze of their terrible website to try and pay your mortgage. What do I mean by that? You have to log into the website to click see my loan information which takes you to another site to log in again. Nothing like a little repetition to frustrate you. If you get lost along the way and call in to try and pay over the phone, because it seems easier....... they charge you $10?????? SERIOUSLY to pay my mortgage? So you are going to charge me to pay you? OBSCENE!!!!! Truly it is a shame that this company bought out our loan. Not pleased at all, going to figure out how to move with another lender as soon as we can. If you have the option do not start the loan here!

This guy is AMAZING!!! I found his work at the Gilbert Art Walk. I now have a beautiful panoramic canvas print of the Swiss Alps hanging in my house. I am hoping to use him soon for some baby pictures. Very professional!

We only found Shanes a little while ago but we could not be more impressed! Every dealing we have has with them has been optimal. They are honest and up front with all of the costs and repairs. Often they even are able to keep the repair below what they expect. It is so hard to find a reliable and honest mechanic - they are a complete gem!

Seriously I could not be more impressed with this company and their rep, Dustin, that came out! Let me start by saying I'm 8 months pregnant and was in meltdown mode when we came home and our AC was not working. After an hour of messing with it we came to yelp to find someone to call. Dukes of Air does not charge anything extra to come out during "off hours" plus number one. We called at 8 on a Saturday night and they had someone at our house in less than an hour plus number 2! Dustin arrive and was very pleasant despite it being 8:30 on a Saturday. He got up on the roof right away figured out the problem and returned to let us know. He carried a binder that read the parts and labor cost for each repair so you know it's the same for everyone, plus three. Simple part repair which took him just a few minutes to fix. Once he finished my husband and I asked a slew of questions about why the part broke, what we could have done, and pointers to keep repairs simple. He never rushed the questions and was happy to educate us. It was now 9:15 on a SATURDAY! He was so professional and informative. We will absolutely call them on everything AC - absolutely AWESOME!!!!

We really enjoyed this place. We saw it on Groupon and since it was close thought we would try it out. We LOVED the explosion roll, the new orleans roll and the coconut shrimp was like candy! We checked in on yelp and got the penny sake. Beer was super reasonably priced without any happy hour or anything.   Be careful because the $2 and $3 plates will add up, but sushi is often more expensive than other foods. The cream puffs looked Devine but were super dry. Staff was really friendly.  We recommend going after 6:30 on a weeknight as the more people that are there the fresher the rolls. Overall very pleasant and we will certainly be back again!

There is a reason this shop has 18 reviews and 5 stars from everyone!!!! Sarah is the sweetest lady out there and so honest! I went in because my glass was separating from my phone. Turns out it was the battery going bad. She did not charge me until she knew what the problem was and then told me what it would cost before she started repairing it. Everything was fixed at the BEST price out there while I sat and talked with her. Great conversation too! I would recommend this for all your repair needs!

The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the location is AWESOME and the hostess was an absolute gem! I have been here a few times, again because the patio is stellar. The first time my food was awesome, I had a grilled cheese with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions. Everytime else has been VERY lacking.   First I would like to mention if in your two years of being open I have never seen the same menu twice perhaps that is something that needs immediate attention. This particular time really irked me. They just rolled out their new menu which seemed okay at best, but way over priced once the food came out. I ordered "beef and pork tacos" off their happy hour menu, which only is one food item each day. The tacos came out with, I kid you not, meat and tortilla, NOTHING else. The lady next to me ordered tacos as well chicken and she at least had cheese on hers. They had a pinch full of shredded lettuce and I counted 4 pieces of diced tomato on the side, which wasn't even enough to put on two tacos as small as they were. When the server returned a long time later I asked if this was how the tacos were intended to be served AKA with meat and tortilla. His response was, it is off the happy hour menu, as if that means it shouldn't have standard taco ingredients. The other lady asked if we could at least get some salsa to put on it since the meat was SUPER dry. Again a very long wait later he returned. I had actually eaten most of my taco since I figured he had forgotten.   Someone at the table had ordered a moscow mule as well and it was almost clear. Last time I checked they had ginger beer which is ginger colored. I tried a sip, it was awful!  Seriously Watershed you are so lucky your location is awesome and I have friends that can walk to this place because really you are getting worse by the minute. I will not even return with friends at this point.

This splash pad is great for a huge range of ages! Our 9 month old loves charging from spout to spout as the water comes and goes. Opens a little later than it should for the summer. Open 10AM-10PM. Tons of playground equipment around as well, but not much shade to keep it cool in the summer. All in all we still love this park.

This place may be good but Ill never know - good luck finding out yourself. The store phone number directs you to a website that is disconnected. So I thought I will just go off the yelp hours they have listed. Nope! They were not opened. How can you run a shop that no one can figure out when you will be open? Not only that but since the address is on the website you just have to drive in circles to find it. Not even labeled well once you get there. Poor business skills!

This place is great! First time here we got a little confused and got skipped ordering. Order at the register not by the doughnuts. Tell them it's your first time there (only if it is) and they give you a free doughnut. The maple bacon doughnut.... It was devoured and DELICIOUS! My hubby loved his coconut creme.   It was nice to see some creativity in doughnuts. They had fruit loop, fruity pebble, and coco puffs in addition to Oreo, red velvet, and that amazing maple bacon.  Girls there were friendly and working as quickly as they could. We will definitely visit again.
