Having just returned from a stint in Baltimore, I was amazed how dead-on perfect their maryland crab cakes were.  My wife had an amazing stuffed lobster.  Worth every penny, try it out!

This place is amazing!  I have seriously been here over 10 times, and it is always declicious.  The arrachera is the best I've ever had.  In my opinion, good salsa makes a Mexican restaurant and this place does not disappoint.  Give it a try, you won't regret it!

Way over-hyped and over-priced, save your money

Awesome food and great service.  I've recommended ths place to everyone in town.  I've tried the tacos and several burgers, and all were declicious.  The sweet potato tots were so good, I got two orders.  Definitely a place to try.

Absolutely horrible!  We were told the two entrees we ordered were not available (20 minutes after we ordered).  Our backup orders were average at best, and not nearly spicey enough).  Only saving grace was that the server was good, but way overworked (1 waiter for the whole restaurant).  We will never go again
