Food was horrible...and service was even worse. All food was over salted and tasted horrible. It didn't seem fresh at all.  Had to wait multiple times for drink refills. Had to wait 10 minutes for waiter to pick up our bill. "Budd"...u might want to find a different line of work!

Cranmore cleaned our carpets yesterday and did a great job. Even though it wasn't a huge job, Mr. Cranmore was very nice, and answered all my questions. We will definitely be using their services again in the future.

Took my wife and 4 kids to this place tonight. Food was very good..and the service was even better. My kids like buttered hot tortillas. When I ordered 2 buttered tortillas, the cashier said that they did not have butter. I told him that a hot tortilla without butter would be fine. When they brought us our food, the owner brought us a cube of butter and said he just went and picked it up at Sprouts. How impressive is that? I have been waiting for a food Mexican food place to come to Surprise for a while now. We will definitely be back!
