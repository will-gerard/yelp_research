This review is long overdue, but months later I still think about IMM and smile (creepy, right?), so I know this meant I need to take the time to share my thoughts.  The scoop: I have a Prius and the dealer quoted me over 3K for a fix that just didn't sit right with me. I looked all over the web for Prius repair in Phoenix and came across IMM Auto and spoke with Dave over the phone. He couldn't have been more kind - We talked on the phone for over 20 minutes about the issues my car was having and he, GASP, actually listened, rather than trying to shove pricy repairs down my throat. The next day I took my car in for diagnostics and lo and behold, all the repairs the dealer claimed I needed has miraculously disappeared. Dave was so cool, knowing the stressful experience the dealer put me through, he didn't even charge me for the diagnostic.   The moral of the story: Car repair shops have a bad name because they take advantage of customers who don't know any better. Dave and IMM Auto were the exact opposite of this stereotype and saved me thousands of unnecessary dollars.   My advice to you is PLEASE, PLEASE get a second opinion from a local, trusted repair shop when something breaks on your car. And not surprisingly, I strongly suggest you get that second opinion at IMM Auto.

Cluster***** Here's the scoop - I really like LGO's food, but the concept can be incredibly frustrating for a few reasons listed below.   - Parking is insane. Yes, they added valet, but it's usually five cars deep to pull off. Also, even if you want to temporarily park in one of their To Go parking spots, it's congested to the point where I've driven away out of annoyance. Not a good sign, when your customers who actually really want to eat there will drive away out of frustration.   - The line to order. Seriously guys, can't you just have table service!? To be fair, they DO have full service in the restaurant during dinner, but for lunch and breakfast (when they are generally most busy) you have to wait in line between tables and shelves overflowing with expensive knickknacks just to order your meal.   - Now after your order, you have to wait around AGAIN to pick up your food at a separate area, shoved in the corner where there are constant staff members leaving and entering the kitchen, the coffee bar, and more shelves filled with trinkets all smashed together with hungry customers waiting for their food. Ugh. Hate to sound like I'm just complaining here, but TRUST ME, it's obnoxious.   If you do visit, go for dinner service only, where you can enjoy your meal as a server will wait on you.   Now on the bright side, their chocolate walnut cookie and chocolate pudding is to die for. Also, I love the avocado pizza - Be sure to add prosciutto.

You know those companies that don't care about their customers and will do everything they can to squeeze that last penny from you? Well, that's my experience with Lifetime, or mainly my experience with their cancellation policy. Seriously, I felt like they smacked me upside the head and turned me upside down to shake out any spare change from my pockets. Dramatic, yes, a tad, but I like most people in this world, don't like feeling ripped off.   After being a member for five years, we left with a bad, bad taste in our mouths. Bad enough that I want to tell everyone I know how lame Life Time is.   Bottom line, is there are too many gyms out there to waste your time with one that cares so little about their customers.

Love. Postino is one of a handful of great Phoenix restaurants we take our out of town friends and family to. Wine and bruschetta on a beautiful patio....Yes, please! Get there before 5 pm for happy hour prices on wine or try their $20 specials on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8 pm.

Insectek has been coming to my house for over a year and I've got to say, I'm impressed. We use to have issues with crickets (yuck). Seriously it was like a cricket concert in our house some nights. I would go crazy, lurking around my house, softly tip toeing in search of locating the various cracks and crevices they hid in. Clearly, I was going bonkers trying to hunt them. Now we only get quarterly visits from Insectek and I'm happily to report I'm a lot more sane because my house is cricket and bug free.   Also what I like about these guys is that the same guy has been coming to my house the entire time. It's nice not to have different strangers trampling through your house each visit. My husband isn't too fond of me being home alone when we have any work done in the house, but I feel nothing but comfortable in allowing them in my home.   Also, super surprising to me is they seriously arrive on the dot of whenever they say they'll show up. It's wild to me how punctual they are - No four hour window where you're prisoner to your home while you wait for them to show up (Hey cable companies, take note of this!).  They've also done termite inspections on our home.  Good stuff.

My current favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I'm almost scared to write this review and encourage more people to visit and eat MY donuts. :)  This is a no frills place and I love that. I've been to too many restaurants that are dressed up with gorgeous ambience but lack in the food department. Chicken + Donuts isn't a fine dining restaurant by any means, it's a simple spot to grab a quick lunch or donut and coffee. Simply put, it's damn delicious.   My favorites are the Vietnamese herb sauce and the lemon poppy seed donut.   Now, because I like sharing, I encourage you to go, but please don't eat all my donuts!
