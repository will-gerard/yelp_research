The PHX airport is clean, large in size, and rather efficient.  Have for the most part always had an excellent experience here. Only a few layovers when flights from rough weather areas don't take off quickly enough.

This is a very average sandwich shop shoved into the same location as a Smoothie King to more than likely save money on rental space.   The location isn't disgusting like some of the previous reviews say but rather the set up and lighting made it seem unkept and untidy. I didn't get the feeling that roaches were running around but at the same time the dimly lit corners of the store front make it seem worse than it is. A bright shiny paint job and lighting improvement would go a long ways.   The food was basically the equivalent of a Subway with the bread not being nearly as good.   The service was pleasant and efficient.   Firehouse Subs just down the road would be a better option.

What exactly defines a sketchy gas station? Well, just stop in at this Circle K and you will get a chance to experience one.   Dimly lit on a dark night, check.   Only having the most expensive gas available, check.   Not asking for any information at all for credit card approval, check.   Bums asking you for money in the parking lot, check.   No receipt unless you see the cashier, check.   Wouldn't go here if I wasn't in a hurry to get back to the airport.

Easily one of the top soccer complexes in the country. The pitches are fantastic with nearly 20 well kept fields. The entire complex is well lit and there is ample parking for even the busiest of days.   The park hosts numerous youth tournaments, recreational leagues, US Youth soccer events, and even US National Team camps.   The backdrop is gorgeous at sun up and sun down. Only complaint would be the lack of cover throughout the complex to aid those in attendance from the heat and sun.

An excellent change of pace from your normal Starbucks in the airport. The cost is A little higher than most coffee shops in the airport it it seems to be a bit more upscale.   I just got an americano and it was great.  Need a wake up call...this is a good spot to get your fix.   Also have several delicious pastry options.

Solid selection if meats, salads, hummus, toppings, ect. The service was fast and really quite friendly. They accept credit cards, cash, and even square if you are into that movement. The original gyro and side salad is honestly more than enough food to feed one for dinner. They also have a wheat pita option but you might have to ask. The ambience is clean, quiet, and nice all around. Parking out front is a little hectic but I believe there is more around the back. Enjoy! I know I will be back when I return to Phoenix.

A good "fast-food" Greek option. I would liken it to a Firehouse Subs if Subway were the low end sandwich shop. Good quality, fast, and friendly. The front staff was very helpful and made a couple of suggestions as to portion sizing mid-order that really helped out my wallet and waist line. I would frequent this spot for a quick lunch if I lived local.   Location is super clean as well!
