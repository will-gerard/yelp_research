I absolutely love this place! My fav is Evergreen with a dash of cayenne.  I settled for the cayenne since this location doesn't offer jalape√±o. I love the kick plus all the goodness of greens! This was my first time at this location and I waited about 5 minutes for my juice. Seriously? Whew. Alright.  I did pay $8.15 for a medium sized juice. Ouch! Buuuut..... It's healthy. And fresh!!! Next time I may try an acai bowl.  Maybe! Xoxo

They have expanded the restaurant about 2 years ago so wait time isn't long.  We love coming here for the homemade cinnamon roll! Check out my photos.  The energy here is pretty much country.  The decor reminds me of grandmas house in Texas. The food is pretty good and the waitstaff will top your coffee off regularly.

All I wanted was a young coconut. Found this place on Yelp, of course. Um... I won't ever eat here. I walked in to grab two coconuts and waited a bit which is understandable. They have to cut the cocos open. Anyway, the place is right. The walls are a weird pistachio color which makes everyone in there look green. Not particularly the best color to make food look appetizing. Also, the place was very humid and the floors were very dirty.  Everything looked sticky.  No thanks.   If I was rating the coconuts individually I would give it 5 stars. Other than that.... Sadly I'm giving this place a one star based on first impression alone.   :(

Between the relaxing music the coconut infused or Hawaiian pedi options, the nail bar setup, location to my house and courteous staff I think I found a new nail spa to come to.  I miss my old place in Peoria and I'll visit there on Thursdays when I'm in the area.  Now if you're on the west side this place gets  for overall experience.  I can't wait to come back and get the coconut spa pedicure.  This place is brand new.  My nail tech was Amy.  This place is brand new! I loved it.
