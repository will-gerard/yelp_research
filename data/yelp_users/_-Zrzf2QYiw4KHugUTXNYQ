The Lost Olives is my favorite car wash. It just happens to be a block from where I live, but as a former Danny's regular what I can say about this place is very important: CONSISTENCY - They always get the job done right, with minimal whining if and when I point out a few missed spots on the bumper, wheels, whatever. My only complaint is the punch cards, I cant keep track of them, wish they would just keep track of my license plate.  Also important if you have an expensive car - there are NO brushes or automated things touching your paint. Just hands. Lots of hands.  BOTTOM LINE: Many hands beat auto-wash any day

I live on top of Cheuvront. Literally.  The good: they sell wine at retail, when I find my cellar is down to those o-so-expensive bottles that are to be savored for a special occasion, it's great that I can pop downstairs and pickup a bottle for 1/2 off the in-store price. They also have a great patio overlooking Central ave, library and light rail and are dog friendly. My dog once escaped from the dog-run area of our building, a feat that involved scaling a 6-foot fence (still baffled) and after a quick search around voila- there she was, meeting and greeting guests on Cheuvront's patio!  From a food standpoint, I agree with many here the portion sizes are not the biggest however most of what they do is consistently well executed. Being a pizza snob, pizza here is not something I do when there are a lot of other choices downtown. I do like the filet mignon, usually two medallion sized pieces with pommes frites  Most of the time it's a plate of various cheeses, nuts, grapes and some bread. I often request them to toast the bread for me, the majority of the time it happens without too much whining.  BOTTOM LINE: I'll take convenience over value

Very festive décor with all kinds of little mermaid paintings and colorful chairs/counters. Chips are light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green salsa.  Fast, friendly and attentive service.  Had the recommended crab enchiladas in a red sauce. Delicious and heavy on the crab, as it should be  BOTTOM LINE: Festive and delicious Mexican seafood in a strip-mall barrio kinda way

I have tried a lot of dry cleaners- good ones are hard to find, and this is a good one. They have $1.35 men's shirts, they do everything on premise and the staff are friendly. I moved about 10 miles from here, and still find myself driving all that way as I havent found anything near my new place that's as good for the money...  BOTTOM LINE: Drop 'em off dirty. Pick 'em up clean.

ahhh Marcellino...  Why do you have to get me drunk? Funny thing is, the more we drink the more I understand your english. Thanks for the help.  There are few places in the valley that can be called true Italian, not to mention ones that are ran by a real Italian chef. Sometimes we go there and ask Marcellino to just "go for it" - havent been dissapointed yet.  BOTTOM LINE: Worth every penny! Dont change a thing.

Aunt Chilada's has it's charm. The front patio (on Dreamy Draw) is filled with mature trees, fountains & vegetation. It's really a perfect atmosphere to pretend you're in the Yucatan swilling Tequila in the jungle if  you like that sort of thing...  They have these fantastic flour chips & salsa that come with your drink- I can eat a whole basket of them before the main course arrives. I always get the taco's and they're consistently good, not great. They make strong margarita's. They have a chocolate fountain on Sundays too.  Oh yeah, this is another place you can bring your dog onto the patio.  BOTTOM LINE:  Great neighborhood Mexican, one of AZ's best patios!

Decided to take the drive out to Kai and try out what many consider the best restaurant in in the State.  We arrived a little early for our 9pm reservation and were greeted first by the valet, then by the 2 hostesses at the entrance. We requested a window table, popped into the bar for a couple of very interesting and delicious cocktails, and were promptly seated at our requested window table.   We thought it was really weird that they assumed my date and I were married by calling us Mr. and Misses (insert last name here) - this happened all throughout the evening, despite the fact that neither of us were wearing wedding rings. We never bothered to correct them but we both thought it was unusual to make such an assumption.  DECORE: After reading so many negative reviews of the decore, I had been prepared for the worst. It did have a "cafeteria like" feel to it, but overall not as bad as I expected after reading the reviews. Probably helped we were placed next to the window in one of the few window tables available.  SERVICE: The service was absolutely outstanding. At least 3 Native American waiters doting on your every need, ever present yet not intrusive. Our waiter took the time to explain the philosophy of the restaurant, it's history and ingredients.  At the end of the day we're really here to EAT - after studying the two tasting menus we decided that the mains and appetizers of the tasting menu were probably the best bet for a-la-carte so we started with the tomato gazpacho and a lump crab appetizer. We preferred the lump crab concoction to the gazpacho.  Second course- we had the escargot, mushroom and caramel goat cheese. Totally about 4 escargots here, not a lot of food, but very tasty with the escargot's cooked to a perfect texture.  For the mains she had the butter basted Potpourri of lobster/scallops/shrimp over a black squid pasta. This was delicious but small from a portion standpoint.  I had, of course, the Tenderloin of Tribal buffalo- now I'm not sure how many buffalo are running around on the tribe these days so I would guess that's a stretch. What I can say is it was tender, delicious, not too gamey. Probably about 8oz in total.  VALET: It was VERY cool to see my car already waiting at the valet, with chocolates and waters in the car. Great service.  BOTTOM LINE: Been there, done it, not sure if I will be back. Total check was $270 including a $65 bottle of Cotes Du Rhone

If you want bar food, this is the best place in town!!!  Teakwoods was started by the owners of the ORIGINAL Long Wong's on Mill Avenue in Tempe. Long Wong's is long gone but the tradition continues- best wings in town, hands down. Every flavor, always fresh, try the suicide wings, I dare you!  BOTTOM LINE: I drive accross town for wings.

This place is not going to win any Michelin stars or James Beard awards, however if you're looking for fast, cheap, and good sized portions Mi Patio hit's the spot. The service is always excellent too.  I like the free chips and the salsa is always fresh and excellent.  Shredded beef tacos are HUGE and tasty.  During the day every beer is $3 but they ALWAYS have $3 Tecate beers 24/7 and they always give you a free shot of some tequila concoction.   BOTTOM LINE: I'm a regular but don't tell anyone ;)

I like the beer. They have a killer patio out front with misters & a few trees. The food is reliable, typical bar food fare & pizzas. Don't miss the chicken wings, and usually you cant go wrong with the specials. We often head there for Friday afternoon happy hour. Did I mention I like the beer?  BOTTOM LINE: Eat, drink & be merry - one of the best AZ patios!

Lux has the best coffee in town, hands down. They roast the beans on site, never bitter like that overdone Starbucks stuff. My penchant for sugar-free vanilla latte's always satisfied here. Free wi-fi. The staff do some jedi mind trick and always remember my name. I can bring my dog, they remember her name too.  BOTTOM LINE: Sometimes I dream of this coffee

I started on yelp after looking for a place to vent about the sad excuse for a short-rib I experienced at The Estate House....I may have found it at the "other" waterfront location - Chelsea's by the... canal.  I found my short rib. It's not that short. There aren't any ribs in it. It's juicy, it melts in your mouth, and it's found only at Chelsea's Kitchen!  ...then there's that thing about putting a fried egg on top of it. Although some swear by it, I just cant understand why you would mess with perfection.  BOTTOM LINE: Great patio. Wholesome & simple food. Yumm!

We love the lost leaf! There is always some kind of entertainment, maybe just a few musicians jamming in the back, very hip. The place is cozy, there's no sign in front other than an OPEN neon sign. If you love beer, they've got hundreds of beers by the bottle.   I am also a wine drinker, I only wish they would broaden the wine list a little, even if that means putting a few more expensive bottles on the list....  BOTTOM LINE: I like the beer & the place is near!

Kandy and the Snapdragon crew have been taking care of me for at least 5-years and I couldn't be happier. The salon features modern design elements and is very clean.

Dear Mr. McGrath,  I recognize you are a talented award winning chef. I love the Roaring Fork. However, I am wholehaeartedly dissapointed in what you've done to Pischke's - its just not Pischke's anymore at all. Pischke's was a fun, friendly, unpretentious, comfort food joint. I loved hitting Pischke's for lunch after a NASTY hangover. The single BEST SALAD ON THE PLANET was the Blackened Cajun Ceaser Salad and now its gone. Old Pischke's would've gotten * * * * * five stars.  Now it's snobby and overpriced.  BOTTOM LINE: Bring back my salad or else!!

It's rare for us to be so completely disappointed in a new restaurant, especially after having heard great things from others.   Last night my girlfriend and I dined on the patio at Estate House. After arriving at the restaurant around 9pm, the hostess lead us outside only to stop us in our tracks and ask that we wait while somebody prepared a table. After about 7 minutes of standing there, we overheard an argument about who would take the table as "somebody had plans" to depart. We were finally seated, the waiter was polite and professional, as well as the sommelier who was quite knowledgeable about the wine we had chosen.   Entre 1 - scallops, with a foamy sauce- were excellent. So far so good. K orders the seared ahi tuna, I order the filet steak (med rare) & short rib - a dish that promises a filet mignon and a braised short rib together. Things progress nicely as they present the ahi tuna - very nice cut, quite an generous portion too. K is happy, more due to the fact the tuna was extremely good quality than the preparation itself.   My filet & short rib combo arrives - STOP - before I even cut into the "filet" which by my generous estimate may be a total of 3oz and not more than a 1/2 inch thick - I note it looks quite well done, a quick cut into this joke of a steak reveals the truth - medium well, not even a hint of pink in the center. On the other side of the plate sits the same sorry looking chunk of short rib, again not more than 1/2 inch thick and 2oz at most. I immediatly point this out to our waiter - who knowingly admitted it looked under-sized and over cooked. After pulling the plate away to "show the chef" (isn't the chef supposed to look at it BEFORE it's served?) he returns saying the new entre will be ready in 4 minutes. After enjoying the evening watching K enjoy her tuna, I patiently waited about 12 minutes for my new entre. Second time around: steak is cooked medium rare, to my delight it was twice as thick as was the short rib - yet the flavor was non-existent.   SO IN THE END the waiter presents our check - $174 - $75 for the wine, $100 for the entrees. I completely expected the restaurant to pickup my dinner entre, after all they couldnt have spent more than $4 dollars on it. I mention this to the waiter who says - I'll check with the manager but nope, they're not going to do anything. Next time we'll go to Chelseas - for a portion 4x the size, 1/2 the cost and with 3x the flavor!!!!   BOTTOM LINE:: Dont WASTE your money!

Yah! Found another great place for lunch near the office. Had the Tuna Steak Caesar Salad and it was fantastic - huge chunk of tuna and only $8.50  This place is always packed at lunch. $2.50 burgers on Monday, $6.95 prime rib on Tuesday, $6.50 Salads - 29 of them, on Wednesday. You get the picture.  BOTTOM LINE: Good 'n cheap eats for Lunch. Probably a great place to watch sports too, but I go there for lunch

Acadia Tavern feels like...your neighborhood tavern!  The place has a split floor plan - large open restaurant on the left, long bar and patio to the right. They do a good job on typical bar food, grilled wings, prime rib sliders, burgers, and salads. They've even got pizza.  There is a regular happy hour crowd here most days. The hotties working behind the bar are always friendly.  BOTTOM LINE: I'm a regular. Enuf said

After a lengthy wait for a table in Scottsdale, the novelty is slowly wearing off, but the steady following attests the warm welcome.  My first visit to Olive Garden was during midafternoon, so I could be sure to get in. After a late breakfast, I figured a late lunch would be fashionable.  The place is impressive. It's fashioned in Tuscan farmhouse style with a welcoming entryway. There is seating for those who are waiting.  My booth was near the kitchen, and I watched the waiters in white shirts, ties, black trousers and aprons adorned with gold-colored towels. They were busy at midday, punching in orders and carrying out bread and pasta.  It had been a few years since I ate at the older Olive Garden in Mesa, so I studied the two manageable menus offering appetizers, soups and salads, grilled sandwiches, pizza, classic dishes, chicken and seafood and filled pastas.  At length, I asked my server what she would recommend. She suggested chicken Alfredo, and I went with that. Instead of the raspberry lemonade she suggested, I drank water.  She first brought me the familiar Olive Garden salad bowl with crisp greens, peppers, onion rings and yes -- several black olives. Along with it came a plate with two long, warm breadsticks.  The chicken Alfredo ($10.95) was warm and comforting on a cold day. The portion was generous. My server was ready with Parmesan cheese.  As I ate, I noticed the vases and planters with permanent flower displays on the ledges. There are several dining areas with arched doorways. And there is a fireplace that adds warmth to the decor.  Olive Garden has an attractive bar area to the right of the entryway. The restaurant has a full liquor license and a wine list offering a wide selection to complement Italian meals. Nonalcoholic beverages include coolers, specialty coffees and hot teas.  On a hot summer day, I will try the raspberry lemonade that was recommended.  There's a homemade soup, salad and breadstick lunch available until 4 p.m. daily for $6.95.  An olive branch on menu items signified low-fat entrees. There is a Garden Fare Nutrition Guide available for customers seeking gluten-free food. And for those with food allergies, Olive Garden has an Allergen Information Guide.  All in all, it is the largest and most beautiful restaurant now operating in Scottsdale. It attracts visitors from out of town as well as people who live here.  Olive Garden is part of the Darden chain of restaurants that also operates Red Lobster. There are about 700 restaurants, including four Olive Gardens in North Dakota's major cities.  Olive Garden has gained a following since 1982 with its ample portions and relaxed ambience. It's known for its classic lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken Parmigiana.  BOTTOM LINE: Winner winner chicken dinner!

Honestly the worst experience we had in Vegas.  Waitstaff was SUPER slow. It took us an hour and a half to eat sub par food.  My girlfriend ordered a salad to start and beef sliders. I ordered the Carvery - beef brisket on sourdough.  An hour after we ordered, drinks long gone and waitress nowhere to be found the food shows up. No dressing on the salad.  Sliders were bland. Meh.  The Carvery 8oz of brisket and 2 pieces of sourdough that they couldn't be bothered to toast, and 2 minuscule little sides of sauces - (you get to choose 2) was underwhelming. How bout some fixings, tomatoes, lettuce, what not to maybe make a sandwich? It also came with some gross pickled veggies.  BOTTOM LINE: Skip it and do tapas next door

Read about this in the New Times, so I Just tried this wing challenge. The rules are now all 10 wings in 8 minutes. I am the 5th customer to win the challenge. The wings are meaty, but tender so its easy to get the meat off the bone. They are using the Bhut Jolakia "Ghost Pepper" which is the world's hottest pepper to make the sauce. Pretty stinging hot stuff, this is not for a weak stomach.  BOTTOM LINE: Burns going in, burns comin' out!

Met some friends here to watch the Boston/Vancouver game 6. Big, open modern upscale space with plenty of high-quality Panasonic 50" TV's all over the place. This is important to me being from the audio/video business- many sports bars buy the cheapest HDTV's they can find and it really shows.  Great beer specials- $2.75 domestic drafts till 7pm, our group loved the fish tacos and huge chicken wings that you can order how you like (all drums please).  Definitely will be back.  BOTTOM LINE: Blue 32 I'll be a regular here too.

The holy grail of barbecue stores, I could spend hours in there just checking out all of the bbq goodies.  Rented a professional grade smoker, "The Good One" - Marshall model for my pal's baby-que party. Loaded this thing up with 20lbs of hardwood charcoal and 12 racks of baby-back ribs, a little cherry wood to smoke, and 5-hours later we had delicious piggy perfection.  Shelton and the crew were very helpful, loading this contraption into the back of our truck and giving great instruction so we had no hiccups. They even fed us some freshly roasted chicken when we were picking up the Good One.  BOTTOM LINE: Worth the drive. My new BBQ heaven

Welcome to CentPho Los Taquitos....  Been wanting to check out Los Taquitos other location for a while, then I saw they opened up at 16th/Glendale.  Went for the street tacos. Had 1 carne asada, 2 carnitas, and one each of the other pork varieties. All were excellent, very fresh, crispy fresh double-tortillas. The hot sauce is delicious, and they brought a squeeze bottle to the table for me which is a big plus. I also tried the Habanero sauce - not too insanely hot at first, but the kind of heat that creeps up. The whole lunch was $8 so I will be back.  BOTTOM LINE: Welcome to PHX, I will be a regular

FINALLY a Sichuan style hotpot in the valley!! I have been travelling to Taiwan and China since 1996 and every time I'm there we would visit hotpot places at least twice a week. I've been DYING for one of these to open in Phoenix, it's just too bad I have to drive all the way to Chandler!!  I won't go into the detail of how it works, what I will say is that it was delicious. The hotpot soup itself is quite good, not as hot as I've had in China, but definitely tasty. The prime rib was in my opinion the best meat, but also the lamb is quite good and more traditional.   Nothing goes better with hotpot than cold Chinese beer, so we stopped at Ranch market and picked up some Chingtao prior to arrival. They charge $1 per bottle to open it, so we brought the big bottles.  BOTTOM LINE: Driving to Chandler is faster than flying to China! I'll be a regular.

I'm giving the Arrogant butcher 4 coveted stars for 2 reasons: first, its hard to find a decent happy hour downtown with $4 glasses of wine, let alone great wine, and these guys have PurVine as the house special.  Second, as if we were in Paris, they have this delicious mussels appetizer with chunks of sausage and french fries piled on top. Thank whomever the brilliant Frenchman was that thought of this, a true chef d'œuvre awaits  The only entree i've had here was less than thrilling, the short-rib stew. It came out piping, skin-off the top of your mouth, hot... When ordering short-rib anything I kind of expect...well...short ribs! Not only was this concoction far from tasty (quite bland, really) there was hardly any short rib to speak of, mostly beans, etc. For some unexplainable reason I've ordered this twice with equal disappointment.  They have some interesting looking daily specials like king crab cioppino on friday that I plan on checking out. I'll let you know.  BOTTOM LINE: See ya there for happy hour

Dropped in to K56 on a Tuesday after checking out the new Little Woody on Indian School. We grabbed a seat at the bar and attempted to order a glass of wine - Matt the bartender was more than patient with our inability to choose a wine so he poured numerous samples for us! Alas a decision was made and we ordered a bottle, of course!  I've said many times I'm particular about my short ribs... I ordered the Cabernet braised short rib with parsnip puree...Perfectly done, tender, fallin apart good sized portion and seasoned perfectly. Yummm!! My date had the mac 'n cheese and it was delicious! Not too heavy on the cheeze/cream and excellent flavor and al dente shell pasta. Perfect!  Manager Brittney was also very friendly and helpful. She pimped us out with a delicious brownie and vanilla ice cream at the end of our meal. But don't tell anyone!  BOTTOM LINE: I'll be back!

While "enjoying" our $2700 first class flights from Phoenix to Nassau we decided to check in here at the Admirals club. Despite the 4 hour delay and first class tickets we are holding they hit us up for $99 saying "sorry this is not a first class lounge"  Fortunately the guy at the counter asked for my ff number and announced that I had 3 passes available. My short term excitement was pretty short lived:  - snack area with 3 choices: cookies, sweet potato chips, and random nut mix. Yuck.  - free house wine. Red tasted like vinegar. Had to pay $12 for a tiny glass that was marginally better  - wifi that spins and spins no connection. Is this 1994?  Leaving this shithole and heading to a restaurant. So happy I didn't get soaked for $99

25 minutes in drive thru. Ordered beef tacos. They tried to hand me chicken at the window. Gave it back after honking the horn and waving arms like a maniac. 3 people back out behind me. 20 minutes later got the order. Wouldn't have waited if I already hadn't paid.  WTF FILIBERTOS?

Maybe it's the 10 year old boy still in me but I LOVE chicken fingers! The thought of a restaurant dedicated solely to chicken fingers lead me to believe they MUST have perfected the art of amazing chicken fingers?  So I thought.  Went to the counter and was really surprised how small the menu is- it's tenders and a few sides, that's it!! Order the 3-tender basket which includes fries and some toast or bread. Asked for ranch STOP we only have our Cane Sauce. BUT I want ranch I exclaimed! We only have our Cane Sauce. and so on... Got my drink, by the time my drink was filled the guy from the counter was behind me with my basket in hand before I could even find a seat.   Fingers - so the chicken fingers themselves were breaded, moist and tender, not greasy at all, however I felt they could be a little more crisp... They were much smaller than the ones in the picture at the store and web site.  Fries - I don't normally eat fries. Don't get me wrong I like fries, I just avoid the carbs so If they were really good I would have eaten them. These were SOGGY, old-school crinkle cut fries!! The place sells chicken fingers and fries. WHY NOT MAKE AMAZING HOMEMADE FRIES? Why not do what the belgians do - cut 'em fresh, fry 'em TWICE (two different temperatures) and make them amazing? These were SOGGY. I would rather eat fries from Wendy's or even McDonalds.  Decore - Very nicely laid out, modern looking store. They spent some money on the place, it's evident.   BOTTOM LINE: If you are going to be a specialty store, you had better ROCK the few menu items you make. It'l be interesting if you are around in a few years.

I would definitely not classify The Little Woody as a dive bar... what has replaced the former dive Great Escape is a very cozy drinking bar with a casual vibe. This is definitely the kind of place you could disappear for a few hours, or say an afternoon, and not know whether the sun is up or down as you stumble out the door and back into reality.  BOTTOM LINE: I've got a bar stool here. Already.

Don't get me wrong- the steak was absolutely Sex on a plate!  I am stopping short at 4 stars merely because the noise level and size of the small table we were seated at made the experience little uncomfortable. We were seated upstairs against the railing at a small round table. With bread, a bottle of wine, water and cocktails all at the same time there was so little space that I nearly killed a waiter below with a small plate that slid off the table and came crashing down to the kitchen below narrowly missing a waitstaff...  Service was spot-on, attentive without being overbearing. I tried to get our waiter to swear at me, asking him to tell me to F_CK OFF Ramsay style off with no avail...  Started with Onion soup while my girlfriend had a salad. Both excellent. Then onto the tortellini, delicious. Moving on I had the American Kobe Rib Cap - this is the fatty outer edge of a ribeye steak - it was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever ate. The absolute star of the show was my girlfriends American Kobe Filet Mignon. It melted in your mouth like butter and was actually larger than the 8oz promised, I guess it was 10oz. Steak will never be the same for me.  BOTTOM LINE: Sex on a plate. Not to be missed.

Had dinner here tonight, we were greeted warmly by the hostesses as if it was a red carpet. Seated promptly at Ricardo's teppanyaki style table were we were quickly met by server Samantha. Started with guac and shrimp ceviche both good sized portions and excellent. Followed with the chicken fajitas and the steamed fish in a banana leaf which was cooked in the table side wood fired oven. Both entrees were generous in size and very tasty.  BOTTOM LINE: Don't miss this place. Its firing on all cylinders now!

Had dinner here opening night, there was a lot of energy in the place - it was buzzing. Really well designed space with a giant tree in the middle and clean, modern design with tricked out lighting. We were greeted welcomingly at the host stand then promptly seated at the sushi bar. At first it was a little overwhelming - I mean sushi, multiple kinds of salsa, tacos, pho - a mixed bag of asian/mexican as promised so we decided to order a course off of each menu area.  We started with the Suzuki Roll - beautiful and delicious with just the perfect amount of crunch and heat. Then we had the lump crab guacamole - with the guac itself being very tasty and well put together and the 'lump' crab being somewhat lacking for a $14 dish. Our conclusion was we'd order the guac again but skip on the crab.  Moving on we had the Mexican Pho - a tasty take on the Vietnamese classic with queso and cilantro. Yum. Along with that the mussels, some of the largest i've seen, in a green coconut & lime - terrific heavy cream sauce that didn't seem too out of the ordinary in a Mexican fusion way.  Then we ordered tacos - they were already out of Pastor so we opted for Chicken - these were tasty little morsels of goodness on some kind of fresh corn tortilla.   We were already getting full so we opted to wait to do any of the larger entree style or wok prepared items. We finished off with an Hamachi roll with slices of fresh jalapeno on top. Yumm. Overall it was a great experience and it will only get better as the staff gets into the groove of things.  BOTTOM LINE:  Get your Mexican Sushi on here! We'll definitely be back to explore the fun and diverse menu.

Went to grand opening for Star Wars 3D. We live across the street at Optima so we've been anxiously awaiting this new theater to open. We were disappointed to learn this is not a "full service" theater like Ipic or AMC Esplanade. It's kind of a hybrid service model - yes they serve alcohol and a limited menu, but you need to buy the food/drinks and carry them to your seat with you.   So we expected a busy opening night, got there early and went to the bar. There was a huge line to get food items so we asked the bartender if we could order at the bar which we did. He then told us we had to get in that giant line to pick up our food when our name was called. This turned into a 40 minute ordeal with half of our party missing the start of Star Wars 3D. Food items were coming up and they were yelling out names, and then the items were sitting there getting cold. People eventually started grabbing items that weren't theirs. Once the food was ready, it was difficult to carry back through 2 sets of doors into the theater - we asked an employee to open the door and he refused until we practically begged him. Then he walked away without opening the second set of doors. Ugh.  Once inside the theater you realize that while the recliners are very comfortable, they are not designed with any sort of table or surface to put your food items on besides a drink holder in the arm rest. So now you are trying to balance your food items on your lap. Ackward.  The other issue is the very limited and unimaginative menu. Corn dogs, hot dogs, pizza, nachos - that kind of stuff. Meh.  Looks like we'll be heading back to AMC Esplanade. Wuff!
