The food is usually good, but the service is AWFUL. It takes FOREVER to get through the line. What takes 45 seconds at Chipotle takes 15 minutes here. They often run out of certain kinds of food. It appears to be run by teenagers who have ZERO sense of urgency about anything. It's too bad, because I love the sweet pork, but I just don't think I can go back again.

Eaten here twice. Both times were excellent. I've had fried chicken thighs and the brisket tips with Mac and Cheese and fries. Food is fresh, portions are generous, and the hospitality makes you feel right at home. Definitely coming back soon!

Had the chicken breast kabob and garlic naan. So good! Everything was well cooked, seasoned and delicious. Loved the red pepper-habañero and cilantro-jalapeño chutneys too. Definitely coming back.

Delicious food. Everything was great. After having their catering I'm excited to visit the restaurant.

Average food, really slow service, sloppy environment. Probably my first and last visit.
