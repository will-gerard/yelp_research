Went there today, Saturday at 4:30 in the afternoon and they were closed.  Their store hours sign says open Saturday from 10:00ish to 6:00ish.  I swear to god, I've never seen anything like it.  I had to take a picture I couldn't believe it.  Even though I live around the corner, I will go out of my way to avoid a place that disrespects its customers like that.  Set your hours and stick to them.

This place is awesome. Found it on yelp when I needed a suit altered in a very short amount of time. 5 stars with so many reviews...for a reason. It has a "homely" feel to it. Customers are like family members. If you're looking for something rigid or traditional, maybe this place isn't for you. if you want really exceptional work and a place that goes above and beyond for their customers, definitely go here. I don't even work or live anywhere near here and I'll be back the next time I need a tailor.

Small little gem tucked in the back of the shopping center.  Obviously the selection isn't as big as Guitar Center, but the quality is much better.  Nice staff, good prices, highly recommend.

I ordered my food an hour and 17 minutes ago.  I'm so hungry, why won't you bring me my food?  I get it, you're probably busy, then don't take my order.  I'll come pick it up, I promise.  edit: Called them once at an hour and once at an hour 20, each time they said he just left 5 minutes ago. Totally ridiculous, I will never order from them again. The teriyaki chicken skewers were really good though, so I'll give them 2 stars, but barely.

Best Chinese food in town in my opinion. Love the sweet and sour chicken, the service is always really good, and solid happy hour prices.

Why am I not surprised this is the lowest ranked walgreens in the area, by a long shot.  When I got there to pick up my prescription they didn't have it. Just, didn't have it in stock. No one called me, no one told me anything. Pharmacist called a different walgreens and confirmed they had it in stock, he sent me there and assured me it would be there.   Guess what wasn't there. Not only was it not ready, no one at that walgreens received a call from any other store.   Luckily there's CVS, Target, Costco...

It says they're open until midnight, so we went at 9:30 tonight.  When we walked in the waiter told us they were on last call.  Their hours are printed on the door, they are open from 4p - CLOSED.   They close at closed.  What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?    The bottle rockets are really good, one star for that.

17 minutes from the time I got in the drive thru until I got to order. They shouldn't have a drive thru if they can't handle it, cars were backed up onto 44th st.

Interesting little cafe tucked in the back of an otherwise ordinary shopping center. The eggs Benedict was delicious, fruit was fresh, service was...okay.  I think the waiter was new, but it wasn't a big deal.  The food came out right and everyone really liked what they got.   Final note, As we were getting up to leave, they were bussing the table when some coffee fell on one of the girls I was with. They were very apologetic and even offered her cash for any dry cleaning (which she rejected), accidents happen and they did the right thing.

Done with this place for good. I don't know why I keep giving it a second, third, fourth and fifth chance. Sometimes I get desperate when I can't drive anywhere. Hour and a half to deliver a soggy sandwich, soggy fries, and the driver forgot my drink too. I don't think I'll get this desperate again anytime soon.

If John Lennon and George Harrison rose from the dead to play one more Beatles concert at the Nile, I wouldn't go.  It was easily 90 degrees inside and they actually have the audacity to charge $2 for a re-entry wristband.

Worst casino staff in Vegas. Not sure you can find a more depressed, bitter, life-fucked-me-over group of people then the casino employees at Hard Rock Hotel. Not the waitresses and bar staff, the dealers and pit bosses. What a miserable group of people. They're lucky there aren't any other Casinos in Las Vegas. Oh, wait.

Damn, that was a really good burger. Not much else to say, good atmosphere, cheap prices, solid service. I'll come back for sure.
