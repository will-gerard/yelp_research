First time here and very impressed! My wife and I brought my parents here and we loved it!  The bruschetta board is the way to go with big servings of each.  We had the red peppers and goat cheese, apple brie and dates, classic bruschetta, and the smoked salmon. All were delicious!  The atmosphere is pretty trendy, and you have to valet your car cause there is no parking around the area.  To be honest its a little hard to have conversations in there as the music was pretty loud.  I could see how they would have that cause it seemed geared more to a younger crowd.  That was the only drawback.  I also had one of their Panini's, the Nine Iron.  It was good but could of done with out so much lettuce and had more meat.  Overall a great experience and coming back again to enjoy the bruschetta board.

This place is great!! I have had a few pedicures in my time and this one is the best. I'm a stickler for the calf/lower leg massage. They added a hot stone to it which made the whole experience!! I might have to come back on my own terms and not with my wife! Great place to go!

Not bad for a jiffy lube. Still overpriced, I think but the guys that work here are pretty straight forward as opposed to other jiffys that try to sell you everything!! Second time here both good experiences.

Cant say enough good things about this place.  I have been here twice and the food has been perfect every time.  the first time i had a new york strip which was amazing, but i was drunk when i had it so my taste could of been altered. The second time i was sober and it was confirmed that the food is awesome.  Get the filet mignon with merlot butter!!! It will melt in your mouth and maybe even tear up cause you have never tasted anything so good!  My fiance had the sea scallops which were good as well.  For an app we had the warmed goat cheese in a tomato sauce, nom nom!!!  Didnt expect anything less from a vegas restaurant.  Will definitely be back drunk or not ha.

First time here and a great experience! Service great, food great, and the pumpkin cheesecake is amaze balls!! They have their own pastry chef in house which seems to make all the difference. My wife had the lobster covered tilapia which was better then my balsamic salmon. Coming here again

This is our go to spot to get our little munchkins hair did!! They do a great job and take great care of your pup. If you are are a working person you are able to drop the pup off at 8 and pick her up when you are done with your workday.  They are great people who are dedicated to delivering exceptional service. They will always put a fitting bow on your pup's collar to match what time of the year it is. Trust this place with grooming and you won't be disappointed. Family owned and operated.

My wife and I ventured out this way after we hiked Pinnacle Peak.  It is a great place to go after a hike cause they offer a variety of healthy options.  All of their stuff is made fresh and tastes that way too.  Only being here once I feel you cant go wrong with anything on their menu.  Definitely coming back!

My girlfriend and i went here three times in two weeks and were never disappointed.  The service was great and the sushi is well priced and excellent.  Their baja roll is amazing and the ambiance reminds me of a vegas style restaurant.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good sushi at a good price.  Will definitely be back there.

I went here one night with my girlfriend and the setting is romantic and relaxing. The service was amazing!  We started off with the artichokes which were good and big!  You get four of them! I ordered steak tacos, which turned out to be the worst thing to get on the menu.  It wasnt that it tasted bad it was the serving size.  You only got 2 and they were mostly filled with lettuce. My girlfriend got the pork tenderloin which was HUGE, and delicious along with their smashed potatoes.  Will definitely go back, but will order something different.

Good place to take a girlfriend or spouse.  It is a little pricey for the amount of food you get, but the quality is high.  I had the chorizo porchetta which was amazing.  The scallops are bomb as well.  Make sure you get the guacamole.  They make it right at your table and how you want it.  I felt bad i didnt have cash on me to tip the guy so if you plan to order that it probably would be a good idea to throw a couple bills his way.  we tried the churros, they were ok but i think we should of gone with the fried bananas instead.  The service was great, very attentive and informative.

I havent been to a buffalo wild wings that has gotten it right and i dont think I ever will.  the atmosphere is blah and the service is just as bad.  It has nicer tvs and setup then the one in tucson but we werent greeted when we came in and there was a girl just standing there not doing much that never even asked us if we needed to be helped.  another person had to come and take us to our seats.  Wings are always good, but dont recommend anything else on the menu.

After I had made reservations at Seasons 52 i did a little research and found out what they were about.  their menu consists of meals that are under 450 calories i believe, which is a neat concept.  When we arrived for our reservation we were early so we waited at the bar and had wine.  they had a woman playing a piano and singing which provided a nice atmosphere.  The lighting is kind of dim making the menu a little hard to read but not to bad.  I started to get a little upset as it was past our reservation time and we hadnt been seated.  I got fed up and was about to go ask them what was going on when the host finally buzzed us. He sincerely apologized for the wait and gave us our first appetizer on the house!! I thought that was great cause it showed they care about their customers.  As a free appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms which were amazing!! they had such great flavor and was an explosion in my mouth!! For an entree i ordered a special that they had which was a surf and turf that wasnt on the menu and was not under 450 calories but was so worth getting!! they gave me a six ounce filet over garlic mashed potatoes with three stuffed jumbo shrimp and asparagus!! Needless to say i was in heaven.  We didnt have dessert but we were so stuffed after our meal we couldnt make room.  ONe of the best dining experiences I have had.  Will definitely go back again!!!!

The food will speak for itself and the view is something you don't get around the Phoenix area. Read it has the top ten views in Arizona. Just go and you won't be disappointed. Hidden gem in the fountain hills area!

This place was great! We didn't need a reservation we walked in and got a table right away. The service was excellent, my water was never empty! I had the Scottish salmon which was cooked perfectly and my wife had the scallops which were also good.  We also had a side of crab fried rice that rocked our world!! We ended the night with a Godiva hot chocolate cake with ice cream. Not to rich but just right. Overall our experience was great! I recommend this place over Mastros ocean club. Better value and better atmosphere

I heard about this place through some friends and decided to go one sunday morning.  I ordered the english muffin breakfast sandwich, which had canadian bacon, egg, tomato and pesto of course. I also ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich which was well worth its price.  The pesto and the perfectly cooked egg made it taste so fresh!! My fiance at the english muffin sandwich and loved it.  I ordered the berry smoothie and that was very good as well.  The staff is very friendly.  I suggest if you want to get something to go you should call ahead because they make everything to order and it took a little bit.  I will definitely be back on a weekend to have a reasonably priced, high quality breakfast.

I wasn't to happy with this place.  Location is great in the Scottsdale Quarter, but the food was bland.  I have had better burritos at roadside stands.  This place definitely misses the mark in Mexican food.  They base their whole menu around the street tacos. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but from a restaurant that looks upscale it didn't deliver. We may come back to this place but not anytime soon.
