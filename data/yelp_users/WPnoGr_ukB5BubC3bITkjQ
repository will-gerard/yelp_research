G&D was a sad day for me.  Have been super excited to check this place out because A. it looks Cool and B. friends have told me how awesome it is   But alas I have to give it a C.... We took the lightrail downtown for a Rattlers game and afterwards hit G&D for a drink and snacks afterwards.   It was really busy because of the hockey game being on so we couldn't find anywhere to sit in the bar area or even get to the bar to order a drink... so we found a table tucked in the corner in the "restaurant" side... only probably here was service.. no one cared about those eating food!    We only had about 10 mins to look at a menu and order before the kitchen closed at 11 so we had to track down a waitress to take our order.  Menu for food was quite typical.  Fish Sandwich, Burgers, etc.  Friends enjoyed it.. but also had a few beers in, so I cant say its more than any other "bar food"  I only ordered the chips and salsa which were less than adequate... straight from the store, nothing special at all.    I think this place could have been a lot better if we had better service and were in the bar area which is clearly the "cool" part.

It's hard for me to rate this place because its a little run down.. but the groomers are amazing, so for Groomers- 5 Star, for actual facility-3 Star.   I've used Janice for awhile now when she was at Fido's on Bell Road and followed her to this location.   The location is right next to Subway and is a hole in the wall by all means!  They have two groomers from what I can tell, Jennifer is the other one and my bf's dog has been groomed by her and she did a great job too.      Why did I follow my groomer to this new place?  Well 1. Fidos Closed and 2. So many places just shave the dogs down, but Janice really takes the time to get to know what you want and takes good notes so when you come back she knows exactally what to do.    If you are in the market for a new groomer I highly recommend making an appt with them just dont be shocked by the location!

This may be the first time I've gotten out of a place with a French tip pedicure for $25!    The place by my house that I normally go was undergoing a remodel so I decided to check this place out with a friend.   It was really busy on a Sunday.  Pedicure was $21 (+4 for anything fancy like French tips).   We thought it would be a rushed pedicure because they were so busy but they took their time on us, prepped our little piggies, scrubbed our feet good and painted perfectly.     Downsides:  Only take cash for tips (you couldn't add it to the credit card when you pay) so we had to run to an ATM and back.   Also, I had a lot of little gnats flying around my chair, my friend didn't seem to notice any by her chair- I was the closest to the door.  So it lost a cleanliness point for me.    (all the tools/staff seemed to be sanitary)  Overall, nothing too special about this place other than it was a good price..

What a fun time!    I can't believe we haven't done this sooner... we spent Saturday afternoon at the track betting on the live races and had such a blast.  It was a little tricky to figure out for first time betters so the first tip: Buy the program for $2 (share among the group- you only need one).  The program will show you all the races for the day including the simulcasts ones if you want to bet on those too.    The live races were about every 30-40 mins.  The TV's will update the odds which fluctuated a lot and don't lock in when you place your bet  There are multiple different ways to bet: Show Bet: ($2) pick a horse to come in 1st ,2nd, or 3rd place Place Bet: ($2) pick a horse to come in 1st or 2nd place Exacta Bet: ($1) pick the order of the 1st and 2nd place horses in order Trifecta: ($1) pick the order of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd place horses in order Super Trifecta: ($1) pick the order of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th place horses in order  You could do smaller bets on the touch screens, one person in our group did a $.10 Super Trifecta bet!    You can "box" bets for additional fees which allow you to get any ordering of your numbers chosen for the bet so if you boxed your Tri bet of 1-8-9 and the horses came in 8-1-9 you still win!    If you want to go check out the horses, go out to the left of the grandstands and you can see the horses before they go out to the track to race.  Beer was about $4 and they are running a promotion Twilight Fridays - $1 Beer, $1 Hot Dogs and races from 3-7pm in April.    Entry fee was $2 and Free Parking.    Clientele: Saturday afternoon had a wide range of families with kids, the local trailer park mullets, Scottsdale's douchiest and ladies in their finest summer dresses (sans Derby hats)  Pack Sunscreen if you are going to be there for awhile.  The grandstands did get quite shady later in the afternoon or you can always stay inside until the races are ready.

Let me start by saying this is a review of the Narande Spa at the Buttes only.  I didn't stay at the hotel but partook in SpaWeek and had a 50-minute massage at the Spa.    This spa is very small and a strange setup.   It almost seems as the "spa" was an afterthought for the hotel and is quickly outgrowing the space they have allotted for it.   You check in and then go to your womens/mens locker room to change into your robe and then come back out to the check-in area in your robe (which is also where people are getting manicures/pedicures) - so far- not relaxing..  They then usher you out the door and across the hall (which is a hallway filled with hotel rooms).  Across the hall is your "relaxation room"  aka a hotel room with the bed removed and some chairs, magazines and some fancy water with pineapple, oranges and cucumber floating in it.   When its your turn , they come into the room grab you and bring you back across the hall to your treatment room which is back where the locker rooms are.  The actual treatment room they put me in had a wall divider used so I could sometimes hear the people in the next room.    Overall, the masseuse was really good, but the atmosphere its self wasn't that calm and relaxing.   The locker room was really small and when there were 6 women trying to get ready it was a real cluster.  I'm assuming it was only this busy because of Spa Week and wouldn't be this crowded on a typical day.

1.5 YEARS EARLIER  Him: "I heard about this great Mexican place in a gas station" Me: (Scrunching  up my nose in disgust) "Mexican food ...at a gas station?" Him: "Yeah we should try it sometime" Me: (with heavy sarcasm) "Sure"  PRESENT TIME  After trying to think of somewhere new to take him for his bday, I finally decided I would try the "gas station Mexican" only come to find out they no longer have the gas station location (YAY!  I don't know why but Mexican food at a gas station just doesn't sound appealing!)  So we headed up north to Dasiy Mtn Road, easily found the location in the Fry's shopping center and then we just stared at the menu board!  There were a ton of options.. so we didn't even know where to begin. Ended up with a Texas Burrito, a fish taco and chicken tacos.  The food was very good, very fresh and very filling!    This is a great little family owned place,  you can really tell the heart and soul that goes into the food and they really make you feel welcome when you come in.  Many people seemed to be grabbing the food to go while we were there.  This is a place I am sure we will be heading back to.. and probably not 1.5 years later!

So I know there are already a million reviews on FEZ and how good the cinnamon dusted Sweet Potato fries are (Agreed- BTW) but I felt like I had to add my two cents in.. and also have an excuse to upload a picture.    We went to an event downtown so we wanted to grab a quick bite somewhere on the lightrail before hand... the bf suggested FEZ because I've taken him to Ticoz and Switch and he has loved both of those... but I have never been a fan of FEZ, I always found the limited menu to be just well, strange... There was always one ingredient they would throw on an item that just made it not sound appealing at all, so I'd always just end up with a simple burger (not even the FEZ burger) and then just be so-so on the place.    So this time.. I decide I would just pick something new and try to enjoy it and if it sucked, then I'd get a Soft Pretzel downtown for dinner instead! FEZ did me proud and we enjoyed our meal and the nice weather on the patio!  We split an order of the sweet potato fries and then he ordered the April Appreciation special, Tomato basil bisque with grilled cheese sandwich on Texas toast! For only $6.50.  I had looked through the yelp photos trying to see what the lettuce wraps looked like to determine if they were going to be good at all because they sounded like they could be too sweet with pears, cherries, dates in it... but since I didn't find a picture I just took a leap of faith and ordered anyways.  They were very tasty and I couldn't finish it all for a meal, so definitely share this others!!   I'm uploading a picture incase anyone else was curious about them.    Overall, FEZ has impressed me more on this visit than in the past... but I still hold Ticoz and Switch's food much higher

They had me at Baked.Goat.Cheese.   The appetizers were phenomenal, we got the Bake Goat Cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the Romaine salad with fuji apple & bacon.  But the baked cheese was by far the better of the two.  Main courses also didn't disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak.  I only had a bite of the fish so I can't speak that much to it, the bf enjoyed it.. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me, but I hate lemon flavoring so it's probably better to take his word for it!   The steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak.  Both entrees were pretty good size portions, especially after appetizers. And we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldn't finish  The actual restaurant its self is very open, there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar that's out in the open.    Valet only, complementary  Sat Night wait time: approx 20 mins  Clientele: On Sat night we had a big table of your typical Scottsdale Cougars, average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 (not the typical place for a bachelorette party)

Never again!  Horrible work, went in for a quick manicure ($15) on Sunday, by Monday it was chipping.  Tech only spent like 5 mins on my nails before painting. Waste of money!  Ps. Only cash for tips

We partook in Dining out for Life last night at Switch because they donate 100%!  And for as busy as the restaurant was, they handled the evening extremely well.  We didn't have reservations (because we didn't know they were taking them) and were seated in about 30 mins.  Switch is already one of my favorite places to grab dinner... great food, great atmosphere and good people.   DOFL was the exact same experience.  The hostess seemed a little frazzled because they were just floods of people coming in without reservations but she did a great job getting people situated, kicking people out when tables were needed and overall maintained a positive attitude about the whole night!  Switch was also smart and had a few waitstaff just playing runners- getting refills, grabbing empty plates, etc.. so you never felt unattended to, V. Smart on their part!!  The food.. wasn't the best I've ever had here compared to in the past, but I'm sure they were just trying to get things out of the kitchen and to the tables as fast as possible.  My Smoked Turkey & Brie Gallette was a little on the peppery side and had too much cheese on it (I know- how can you have too much cheese?!).   The bf got the Creole Jumbo Shrimp and said he really enjoyed the flavor (he cleaned the plate so I have to assume he absolutely hated it!!).     Overall we left full, our wallets a little lighter from donating to a good cause and smiles on our face from good service.   Thanks Switch for another good experience and for donating 100% to DOFL!

A hidden gem!    We never knew this place existed and stumbled into it after lunch at Chino Bandito (next door).  They have all sorts of flavors of popcorn and are more than willing to let you sample them. Even some seasonal flavors. We were really excited about the Cake Batter flavor but we sampled it in the store and were a little disappointed in the lack of cake batter flavoring, too much spoiling by Cold Stone's ice cream flavor I guess.    We took advantage of the bakers dozen deal on the small snack size bags so we could try lots of flavors, it was 13 bags for $11 (normally $1 each).  They were even willing to make us a bag of a flavor if we didn't see it in the small size.   They have many more flavors than what's on their website, some of the ones we got were Churro, Bacon & Cheese, Cookies & Crème, Coconut, PB & Chocolate, Cherry Chocolate and Candy Bar.    The store had lots of cute tins/gift ideas so next time you are trying to come up with a gift idea for someone, this might just be a great alternative option to the classic gift card.

Eh.   Not impressed.   Heard some glowing reviews on this place and how great it was so was pretty excited to try it because who doesn't love pizza?!    My pizza was undercooked and dripping with olive oil (not in a good way!)   The only thing going for this place is the crust.... It's pretty good when the pizza is cooked thoroughly to enjoy it.   Our server was very uninterested in actually being at work, and working in a boring chain place like this I could see why- no real character to the restaurant.    With so many great places to get a good pizza in the valley... skip the Mellow Mushroom.

If you haven't experienced Jimmy Johns  yet.... grab your car keys, your walking shoes, your bike, your bus pass, whatever you need to get there and experience the pure awesomeness that is JJ's.  Yeah, Yeah its just another sub shop right?  NO, the bread is amazing and baked fresh every day.   They even offer "Free Smells" which is a way better smell than the Subway Stench you have stuck in your clothes for days after you walk in the door.   JJ's uses fresh ingredients, amazing baked fresh daily bread and makes it "So fast you'll freak" right there.  My sandwich is usually done by the time I'm don't paying for my order.  The sub names are fun too, who wouldn't want to order a Pepe, a Turkey Tom or the Gargantuan!  They have vegetarian options, low carb options (unwhich- but why you would get rid of the best part of the sandwich is beyond me) and will customize your order if you don't like the menu options.   JJ's also offers their "day old loafs" for pretty cheap (under $1) and is great for making garlic bread  or something at home.  Coming from the Midwest, JJ's was a staple and I was really disappointed when I first moved here to find that the valley was JJ free... luckily all good things from Michigan are slowly creeping over here, Jimmy Johns, Bell's beer and next we might just see Coney Island's popping up.

Food... 5 Stars! Service... 3 Stars.  We just enjoyed a nice dinner on the patio with our Deal Chicken coupon and everyone absolutely loved the food.  Shrimp and Grits and Crusted Chicken between the three of us and everyone shared bites of each others dishes.  And we of course ended up splitting a Krispe Kreme Bread Pudding (uhm... YUM.   I dont even want to know the calories in this amazing desert.. just order it!)  Dan (owner) was our part waiter and made sure to go out of his way for us to make up for the slow service (they had just fired 3 employees on Friday).  He even offered to go to the grocery store across the street to get me a soda that they didn't carry.  Talk about really great southern hospitality!   The food more than made up for the slow service, and on a beautiful night on the patio we weren't complaining about being able to socialize with each other while we waited.  We will be back for sure.. probably for a Boil night and maybe even breakfast for the homemade biscuits Dan told us about.    If you are in the area... you must stop in here and have some good Cajun food, all made fresh to order and to your spice level!   Mmm.. Now we are thinking about planning a trip to Nola in our near future!

This one is all new and shiny and stuff!    I know it's a dollar tree so it won't last long... but this location is great for party supplies.  We are doing a Hawaiian luau theme and they had tons of stuff from leis, decorations, flip flops, plates and glasses.. just about anything you would need.  Also seemed fairly well stocked on Graduation Party supplies if you are in the market..   This location also had a pretty big selection of Wedding, Bachelorette Party, Birthday, Baby Shower decorations/supplies and as usual they have TONS of gift bags, wrapping essentials and enough balloons to create your own version of UP.   I didn't check out the sections for food or home supplies but I would assume they are on par with the rest of these type of stores.
