I really enjoyed myself here!! I wish mamas was closer to me! The prices are around starbucks but, that's okay. I was spontaneous one day and wanted to find a great place to sit and work and I found Mama Javas! So awsome! Im not a "hipster" so I wasnt really feeling the atmosphere or did I feel like I fit in (they could work on that) But, I was there to work and enjoy coffee and I did. Bagel was amazing too!

A true Sunnyslope gem. Im not even kidding when I say we order atleast once a week.... Pizza is phenomonal and the wings are GREAT! We have had one run in with an employee being rude but, Mrs. Stumpy messaged us on yelp and we great about it! We appreciated it. There can be long delivery times but, thats because, ITS SO GOOD EVERYONE WANTS IT! Im telling you amazing. A lot cheaper than spinatos and a lot more (If you're in the area and can't pick) Delivery is cheap too so we don't even have to leave! We came in for lunch one day and the cashier who was a lady (Amber? Amanda?) Can't remember but, was SO Nice!

Can you say BEST CHURCH EVER? When you come here... You become family. It may be a big church but, it makes it all the better. The barnetts are simply amazing. Groups are amazing. I love it so much! A great part is they offer free day care during service so I have something to do with my toddler while I worship! I love PFA!

I love this chipotle. Very generous on meat unlike metro location! Not to be rude but, everyone speaks good English too. I get very upset trying to explain how I want my burrito at the metro location and its never right and they don't understand. Always fast. I always have the same lady when I pick up. She always writes my husbands and is name on the bag with hearts. She's very kind. I love this location.

The other night my husband and I came for a date night. My husband has always been big on this place but, I haven't. We always leave disappointed, this last time topped it off for me. We were sat and someone came up to us and got our drinks. Okay 20 minutes passes....no drinks. I flag a guy down and tell him and he says oh sorry I'm actually your waiter what do you want to drink. I was calm. Said my drinks  again seeing if he'd apologize. Of course not! So than! I try to say were ready to order and he already stormed off..... Fifteen minutes more we get drinks and I really wanted an appetizer but, didn't want to be there all night and realize i was glad I didn't order, their appetizer prices are entree prices. I believe that a plain cheese crisp was 5-6 bucks! Crazy! I ordered a pollo con Caso or something its similar to valle lunas fundidio.... (says my husband who was waaaay wrong) and asked for carne asada and was charged 3$ extra.. By the time we got it 30 minutes later. It was cold and the meat tasted like hamburger meat! Ewwwwwwww! I got one refill the whole time we were there.not by choice... I  was so upset and thirsty already ticked off I waited another 30 min for my bill! My husband asked for the 99 cent margarita and even pointed it out that the people next to us had it.... And he got a huuuuuuge one and then we told them it wasn't what we ordered and still had to pay for it my husband had two sips maybe because it was strong and he didn't like the taste! I finally had to hunt down the manager...I had to explain the situation....he didn't apologize just brought me my bill,.....didn't even comp us for the crap service food or wait times and we left. Glad to say I didn't tip! No way! Another thing e hostesses shirt was like see through and loose...she didn't leave any room for imagination and their outfits are cheesy anyways! Don't go Here! Pay the extra few bucks at Valle Luna or macayos.......

Kinda ditzy waitresses but, this is my favorite place to eat in the WHOLE world! I am pretty mad that I wanted to have a group of 15 for our anniversary this year but,  the marketer I was emailing back and forth with (anthony) said I have to PRE PICK what everyone is going to eat or have buffet syle. My family and friends would like to pick their own food out. He said it's because, of the holidays... Well you just lost a BUNCH of business! He was rude as well.

They don't serve breakfast after a certain time... Kinda turned me away... Their menu is very basic as well... One thing that reallly set me off was I came in from a road trip for Phoenix with my husband and daughter expecting to get a nice warm big meal and a nice family brunch on a Sunday...  We walked in and it was packed so we expected to wait a bit for a table... The lady tells me "Around here we're not strangers to anyone and we sit together." and than walks us to the back and puts us next to an older man eating his lunch... Kinda ticked me off because, I have a one year old and she likes to sing, play,and, be loud and I didn't want to be rude and they would not move us. I didn't want to eat in front of a stranger either or have to limit my conversation over lunch because, we were sat with a stranger... Needless to say I paid for our drinks and went to the mexican joint across the street and I wll not be coming back. I was also appalled by the way my 2.00 drink was served.. A can and a cup of ice REAALLY!?!?!?!!?

The terrible egg.....  Our food came out cold, dry , and, BURNT!  The waitress acted offended that we asked for  a new plate... I told them I will eat it regardless because, I was dead hungry (AND pregnant I'll eat anything)  Manager was kinda a you know what when we nicely explained to her the problems... She did bring us more potatoes though even know we said no..... Surprisingly they came hot and not burnt... Not hard to do things right the first time....;   She said she'd take care of the bill for us.. Cool.... She came and handed the reciept to me.... 13.00.... For two people knocked off a whooping 7.00 (When both of our plates were 10+) and I dont mind paying it but, i didn't eat it! come on now lady!

I wish we had the option to give no stars. I normally don't waste my time on bad posts or negative reviews but, I feel this is something I should share. Today I took my dog into the dog groomers next door. I do not live in the area so I tried to kill time around the area. I came back to the area and I still had twenty minutes to kill... There's nothing in the plaza to sit down and relax at SO I found Long Wongs. It was about 4pm so I didn;t want a filling meal because, I had to cook dinner for my family... I had my two year old with me so, I asked for a kids meal.. The lady I believe they call mama looked at me and said that's it? I smiled and said yes. She got very rude with me and said you need to spend 4 more dollars for me to take your card. I said fine can I get a slice of pizza? She said Okay you don't want a drink? I said no I had a tea in the car. She sighed at me and took my card. She said is this to go? I said No, I will be eating here. She said I don't let people eat here unless they spend 10.00. I said are you kidding? She said no but, since we aren't busy I will let you sit down. I HAD A TWO YEAR OLD WITH ME IN 120 heat mind you! Wow! So... I was a little irritated needless to say but, it was better than waiting in the car in the beginning of July... When our food came out... i was appalled! My two slices of pizza looked like Dignornio.... My daughters corn dog was BLACK... and her fries... Were DISGUSTING so DISGUSTING... They were tasteless. We took a few bites threw it away and walked out. I will never ever ever go back to this place. You never know who is going to walk through your door as a business and your impression lasts... I own a store in the area... When they asked for a good quick bite to eat... it will not be long wongs.... I can't believe how we were treated and served. Sad!

We moved to Colorado awhile back and I can honestly say we have not found anything like this. I've been coming here since they first opened as a kid. I don't remember if it was this location! My dad and I went every Sunday! Every friend or family member who walked my path I take them here for dinner now I live 1000 miles away and CRAVE this place!!! I miss it!!!! I think I need to franchise Denver LOL!!! We even got a free dinner for leaving a rave review!!!

I wish you could rate things separately but, all the stars are just for the way this place looks... Management is horrible and the ladies the in office need an attitude adjustment... They do know we pay they're checks right... Danielle can be nice The apartment sold its self. She was kinda rude until we signed our lease!The other night the security guard was taking pictures of my jeep (which was in in covered) and he was taking pics of my license plate....so, I went out for a walk.. Yeah a "walk" to see what he was doing and he was taking pics of other cars.. I thought maybe it was something they put him up to but WHY would he take a pic of a car in uncovered it's free parking to whoever comes first... did I mention once he acknowledged I was there he was do quick to talk to me and short talk with me.. Ya sketchy.Well the next day I saw Danielle pull up to the phase two and I waited for her shes usually civil with me until I was straight forward and told her the story above... And she laughed at me.... I DID NOT COME TO HER TO GIVE HER A GOOD LAUGH AND I DIDN'T FIND IT FUNNY AT all.She began to walk off and said I'll look into it and nothing else! Rude much. I've had instances where I've called ALL day and no answer but I go up there and they're all there... Wow. Last time this happened I went to pay my rent and it looked like I was interrupting social hour...  They were quick to snatch my check and my nieghbors had the law at my door asking questions about them this was 2 days after i move in...I have never met or seen them and asked a lady in the office if she knew anything. I wasnt trying to be nosey I was concerned I have a baby! Well long story short they told the neighbor who I was and that I was asking them what's up and I was being nosey... Totally unacceptable!!!!!!! Right? Right! Luckily it was nothing and I met a GREAT NEIGHBOR. I love her to death now even though that day when I asked the office... She told me she was crazy! She's really not. How high school.My neighbors across from me were let out of the lease because a scorpion infestation! They're poor six month old got bit and another neighbors little boys were but multiple times! Luckily we know how to do pest control our self. Not lucky that we have to pay 5$ a month for pest control a month and I'm home a lot an never see them.... Ive ha multiple neighbors tell me they feel helpless. There's two complexes here 5$x 100+ apartments.... Imagine the profit they make on us just off pest control.... SCAM I've seen burns twice and the techs belly was hanging out of his shirt and he was spraying the dumpster... Seriously wtf?!?!? Wouldn't that make them run to the apartments. Just sayin. You have to walk with a black light everywhere at night phase twos pool is indeed infested with scorpions under the gill there is millions... What's the point of being home when you can't kick your shoes off for fear of scorpions!!! Fix it already we've all complained enough. I know it's unrealistic to have them all gone but control it!  And now for my biggest complaint... The biggest scam... The water.. We were never told when we moved in it was split between the buildings... Wouldn't seem to be a big deal because this is apartments right? No!!!!! We were gone all summer home maybe one week of each month... 68$ Here it's just us and a baby and we work and are never home..on top of that were in a two bedroom the SMALLEST ONE... We have two sinks a toilet a bath tub and a laundry machine we never se and dish washer that explodes so we hand wash...Scam... Last time I paid rent I just asked.... "So is water just split between all of us?" she looked at me like I was stupid.Next time I'll just keep my mouth shut and give you my hard earned wasted money...And to my neighbors above me I understand kids.But seriously allllll night and day I hear doors slamming and it sounds like a dang sumo wrestling. Security has never done anything about it! I've called at least 20 times I've seen them up there ONCE! Wow! Haha. Security right? Isn't it nice when your newborn actually sleeps???? Well I wouldn't know because she's up screaming scared from the bangs all night and pictures on our walls falling.... Oh and when she finally goes to sleep...landscapers are right at her window at 7 am!!!! So cool!!!!!!!! Not. 9 am would even be a blessing when she is up all night from the neighbors above....Does this sound like somewhere you want to live for a year?  Iunprofessional 95% of the time unless your giving them money or not addressing a problem.YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PROFESSIONAL CARPET CLEANING COMPANY TO CLEAN YOUR CARPETS WITH RECIEPT... I've never heard of

Horrible office staff! I wrote a review on the other site and I had to delete half of it because, my review was too long. I could go on and on and on. I regret moving in here! I'll probaly stay because, I like the area and my apartment (Stupid right?) and I hate moving. My apartment is fine it's just the staff and the way the run things. I avoid them as much as I can. I am still a little ticked that we were gone for 3 out of 4 weeks last month and our water bill was 68$ for a SMALL two bedroom... They split the water up between buildings... Like really? There are one bedrooms across from me and than the other two bedrooms.... This place is ridiculous... I could have a house for what I pay and not have to deal with the caddy ladies in the office (One of them actually is pretty nice!) THEY NEVER ANSWER THERE PHONES EITHER.... My toilet wont flush and my dishwasher blew up today. What a great day off. I guess I'll have to goto the office tgo use the bathroom all day today because, they wont answer or respond to emails. Sheesh! Also, The security gaurd was taking pictures of cars in uncovered parking! Why would he do that? He saw me outside and started to short talk me. I told Danielle about it and she laughed... I don't find that funny? I didn't go to the office to give her a good laugh either. He has a picture of my liscense plate for god sakes. I heard Phase one is a lot better than phase two and that phase two has a lot of kids in it.. Obviously, because, they are stinking rude! They don't do anything to control the residents street bikes all night here either. They really need to get it together. I loved it when I moved in but, my base rent is 705.... I've been paying close to 1000$ every month after all of their ridiculous add ons. Read the fine print! They charge us 5.00 for pest control EVERY month and I have seen them twice. THEY SPRAYED THE DUMPSTER! WTF! That would make the bugs come this way....

Nothing has gotten better here... Let me tell you I have NEVER had a complaint on me and I am rarley home. Well. my neighbors are upstairs and at 1 AM last night I called security because, they're noise level is out of this world and it scares my little one. I have made the office aware of this on several occasions... Well, today the office man Josh told me that the neighbor called complaining that I am noisey (keep in mind that I have never have a complaint and am never home) and told them my husbands alarm clock wakes him up. MY HUSBAND IS HEARING DISABLED. The nerve on these people!! And my "dog is loud and scratches all day" I DONT HAVE A DOG!!!!!!! And, Josh said he is taking the neighbors complaint seriously! I have been complaining for months. i understand they have a kid but, so do I and she gets woken up and is scared of the banging! I would be happy if they transfered us... But, they want to charge us a 250.00 transfer fee and RAISE OUR RENT ALMOST 200.00 FOR THE SAME FLOOR PLAN!!!! If we went to a one bedroom it'd be 78.00$ more...  HOW unfair is that?! I understand apartment living I really do! But, midnight till six am is just tottaly un fair for us. I understand they have a kid but, so do we and we get up early. I cant hear my neighbor next door with three kids! They say were noisey? Every neighbor we have says they dont hear us and they always ask if weve been gone awhile! JOSH ALSO ASKED ME TO HAVE MY NEIGHBORS COME TO THE OFFICE TO VOUCH FOR ME. I find that so unprofessional!!!! Why bring them into this? Why even go that far? Why not transfer us and do the right thing and make us happy. I hope they let us out of our lease... I pay way to much here to be treated like this and go through this stuff. I am RESPECTFUL and if i am home... I am quiet and mostly sleep. How is it I can complain for months and the neighbor says one thing back about me and its taken seriously? Also, I dont want problems its frustrating when my baby screams and can't sleep at night... But Josh keeps telling the neighbor what I say and tells me what he says and that DOES not help at all.... I am sick of this!!!

After standing my ground I was finally let out of my lease. I feel like I was treated like a dollars sign and not a human being at all. I am a mother and whenever my kid is not in a good environment... Best believe I will fight to the bitter end... It should've been a lot less bickering than it was... The major thing that really made me upset was....I had to attempt to get a hold of corporate like ninety times and they NEVER called back I was finally notified by email I could leave... Another thing was Josh telling me that my neighbors had to come vouch for me about my noise issue which was just degrading for me that I had to get them involved. Life after Talus Ranch has been a lot less stressful.. No neighbors up till 3 AM scaring my infants and than landscapers at 7AM waking her up after no sleep! Nice! Another issue is Talus Ranch's CAT issue... I am not sure if a lot of people have "outside" cats or they are lost or just strays but, night before carpet cleaners came (and I WROTE the office about this cat!!!) a cat got into our apartment and peed on our living room carpet... Guess who had to foot the 250.00 carpet cleaning fee... ME!!!!! Wow.... Needless to say I sucked it up because, I just wanted out... I feel like they did whatever they could to pin me with charges because, I got out of my lease free and clear... I don't have to smell marijuana every time I step out side either.. Nice! I don't have to worry about my car anymore either!

I would give this place half a star if I had to. I have never felt so degraded doing business with this best buy. I spent 1300$ on  mac book febuary 29th, 2012... Not even six months ago. I took it in  because, my daughter spilled koolaid on the keyboard. YES! My fault but, I could still use a USB mouse and keyboard. (Better than nothing right???) So, Still useable so I dropped it off on a Thursday to see what they could do... I picked it up on a friday.. I got my laptop back (Keep in mind that when I dropped it off everything worked on it I was still able to get into my user accounts) and when I got home... I was stuck in a guest only account! I couldn't get to any of my info or anything. No user profiles to be found. I took it back they said they had corrupted my osx..... So they "fixed" it and I picked it up... Wifi wasn't working on it! And it still isn't I do not want to take my macbook back to this place. On Thursday when I dropped it off the cashier stated her computer was being "retarted" (Which is hurtful and not right to use at all!) I was appalled. I have special needs family remember and I don't think any one should use that word when referring to something NOT working.... When we picked my laptop up last night the first man to work on my laptop walked by us at the geek squad podium and gave us the dirtiest look ever. If looks could kill!!!!! So, I will not be doing any more business with best buy due to their attitudes in store and online. No one answers me at corporate and when I call they tell me "Try taking it to a different store (Like I have all the time in the world) Also, I was not aware of what I was signing.... They said it was a paper to check in and out the computer... And apparently I signed a form saying my laptop was in "dirty" condition and Geek Squad CALLED me out over this in a Facebook post. My keyboard may be sticky from a little toddler in her terrible twos (I am distraught over this!) But, TRUST me. My laptop is NOT dirty!!! Not at all! Not ever. I posted pictures of my mac-book on their Facebook wall to show them it is almost in like new condition (Besides the keyboard) I have never dropped this laptop! They said It was from a dangerous fall my cords were loose and there were scuffs and scratches on it. There's a little bit of wear and tear on the bottom from being on tables and counters BUT apple products dirty easily. Theres NO Scratches on the screen NO scratches any where. NO DENTS especially. And, they have a the nerve to call a customer a liar.... They just lost a good customer I used to spend 30-60 a week at best buy just for ink for my business and for business odds and ends... I learned my lesson and I would never treat customers the way they do. By the way I was "spamming" their facebook page by asking for someone to email me back and please help me before I picked the laptop up (So I didnt go round and round with them). Im so done with this place. I am NO liar. I am just a customer who happens to own a business and my business and schooling are all done over a macbook... SO it's vital I have mine! It's not my fault they handed a laptop back to me twice with different issues than I brought it in with. Corporate does not care either.

Dr. Heard Vaughn was by far the worst doctor I have ever had. I regret using her through my entire pregnancy. She's very cold. My c-sectin was an absolute train wreck. I will give DR HV props for coming in on her day off to do it because, I demanded she did because, the on call was not any better. She complained my whole C section about missing a football game. I was on hospital bed rest with my first in Banner. Dr. HV never bothered to come see me in ante partum. My high risk doctor ended up demanding her to deliver me due to my preeclampsia. I do not recommend her to anyone. My second pregnancy I went into her office just for a blood test to confirm HCG for insurance and she had LAUGHED in my face and told me I am the worst pregnant prerson. I never returned. I had found an amazing doctor to take her place and I had the SAME problems my second pregnancy (Diabetes PRE E and HELPS) and my second doctor took such good care of us! My second daughter wasn't in the NICU either... She was delivered at 37 weeks like my first child. I strongly believe Dr. Vaughns terrible judgement and calls kept my child in way past a date that she was safe with what i had going on.... Don't walk away RUN!

If I have any worst enemies I would tell them straight up dont walk run from this place. Wouldnt even tourture them with this place. Last night at 3 am we were woken up from a fire. Smoke everywhere. We got up not knowing what was going on and started banging on everyones doors before the smoke got to thick. No staff or announcements. My husband and I grabbed our phones and went outside after not knowing what to do for what seemed like eternity because we couldnt see where the fire was coming from and where the stairs were. We had no idea if it was even safe!!!! We watched and helped families with children get down not even seeing staff around. We went outside in the freezing weather (actually a cold night for vegas. I live in the midwest and it was cold to me!!!) We went back ino the casino and i had went to the front desk attendant to ask her if i cluld get to the east side cannery because, i had to work this morning i am here on biz. She straight told me One room left and you will be paying for it. Youre kidding me right?!?!?! I called the east side to see what they could do. They told me open our window (in 30 degrees) and run the fan (which reaked of smoke!) It wasnt sucking anything up!!! Anyways, we got a room change and couldnt run the heater in there. Still smelled it!!!!! It was coming through our heater and so we slept with the heat off freezing. Our belongings were just smoke damaged. Smells terrible. Ill be having to replace everything for the wedding we are in this weekend. We witnesses staff throwing f bombs at eachother. They were so unproffesional with this situation at both cannerys. I am disgusted. Never evet ever again. NOT one staff member made sure the guests were comfortable or gave us any updates or letting us know anything. Not even a sorry you got no sleep for work at checkout which i was late today trying not to smell like an electrical fire. I have not heard anything from management about my complaints and dont epxpect too. They should have insurance to cover their guests and put them somewhere safe. We called over 20 hotels this morning at 3 am trying to get sleep. All over 300!!!!!!! Really? Like im gonna foot that bill . They should have maintained their heaters and made sure they wrre safe with cold weather!!! We booked a month in advance for the price. Absoutley ridiculous!!

This may be a "mom and pop" shop but, it sure is delic. I prefer coming here over anywhere else because, I AM  given individual attention and the family that runs this cafe is just to sweet. I am a regular and I love the Italian sub... No joke I eat probably 3 to 5 of them a week (I never liked italians before i tried Zax!) this place is very budget friendly and i never expect anything less than exceptional service. Zach works in the restaurant and he is a complete sweetheart! Oh by the way... Coffee is amazing! Anyone that wrote a bad review on here is 1) A yelp bully 2) Doesn't understand the way a mom and pop shop is/runs... Goto a 45$ a plate restaurant.... Honestly, It's probably the only place in the world that will please someone like you! GO ZAX! I looooove Zax!

People on here that are complaning on "over priced items"... Stick to eBay... I think the prices are fair because, she does have to pay rent for the shop and other business needs like employees and so on and so forth. You're supporting a local business shopping there and not a big dog. I have had GREAT experiences with Hissyfits and SOME okay ones and SOME "Im never going back there!" ones too but, I do go back. It's a love/hate relationship with the place... I think business is booming for Hissyfits and they're running out of space... It's really hard for me to get around in there and I usually have to have a baby sitter if I want to go there because, trying to get through the store with a toddler is absolutley impossible. I have had some instances with employees being rude but, never the owner. I have found some KILLLLLLER deals though and ones you are PROBALY not going to find on ebay! Some people on here complaining how they'll stick with ebay.. Than do it... You're always going to take a chance of ordering on there and you don't even see the product first it could be a tottaly different picture or size or it could be damaged! Shipping is a pain too... I like my things now. Compared to other shops in the Valley.... Hissyfits has it going on... IF you want to talk about being "over priced" I have seen some REDICULOUS shops that aren't HALF as nice as hissy fits... One of them is on cave creek and Sharon by the church on the hill... I DONT EVEN care to remember the name of that place it was SO over priced. The high chairs looked like they were from 1908 and every item I saw in the store was target-walmart-kmart brand... So go there and than come complain about how horrible hissyfits is! She runs a great local business and being a business owner and a mom... Its a tough life style! I do it too. I think the events she puts on are just wonderful. The only complaint I could have is maybe, some employees could have some attitude adjustments (but, they are young from what I've seen) and also, the space is cramped... I truly believe one day she will expand tho because, she does so great. My love/hate relation ship is more love! Hissyfits keeps my daughter looking stylish on a budget. I run a baby business (not consignment) so, I do know my prices and hissyfits is great! People need to get it together.

I agree YCs is the best around. I do not like stir fry paradise because, you can't take it home. Your wasting what you don't eat...dumb! Every time ive gone in there i feel like i am being watched like a hawk by employees. Always bad attitudes. Not a fan..

Went with husband a few weeks back. I really enjoyed myself. Doesn't look like much on outside but, the inside and patio. Romantic and beautiful! I will be back when I travel back to the good old slope! I loved our waiter. Patient! I take forever to pick what to eat! And very nice. Pizza and salad is to die for. Better priced than the breakfast joint scramble next store!

Amazing food! Amazing service! The cinnamon apple side is oh so delightful! Never had any issues! I have had the sweetest waitresses. Some things can be crazy on price but, so worth it when it gets in my BELLAY! Haha.

The server was very much in our face the whole night. Eavesdroppping on our conversations. Being annoying. Also stood there and waited for us to tip when we handed him the bill. Luckily my husbands a sweetheart because I would've dropped down a dime and left. I just find it very rude! The food took forever and it was cold when it got to us... Not worth a 90.00 tab to me!

Pricey. Not worth it. But, unique food! Another thing is a friend of mine who is a manager of sauce told me the owners of scramble would cone take notes of sauce before scramble opened. I see a lot of sauce in scramble.... Not cool. Not original. I feel your paying for the uniqueness of the food not the quality. I'm happy sticking with Denny's and not breaking my bank... Three dollar OJ with our refills? Reaalllllllyyyy?!

Not a fan. All pizzas on the menu are very funky. I am not sure what the hype is about this place. Peperoni is not even on the menu! Lol. PIZZA IS WAY OVER PRICED. The server reminded me of Moby and was very odd. He wasn't friendly at all and called me a "whimp" for wanting cheese and pepperoni pizza.. Sorry, I  must be from another planet. I'm not going to go here again. Everything is overpriced. On a thursday afternoon this place was so loud I couldnt even hear my thoughts..

I wouldn't even give this place a star dis freaking scusssting!!!!!! We went in at 7pm and the food was cold and stiff. They didn't put anything new out and we didn't get one refill. We were the only ones in there. My friend said it's horrible as well. I should've listened.. Un professional staff. Let their kids run around wild screaming while we ate and  they were picking at the buffet...... Never again. I doubt happy buffet will be there long I've grown up in the slope and nothing lasts in that spot any ways thank god!

I have to go up this way for work sometimes and I drive by A LOT. I finally stopped in during lunch. It was awkward being the only one in there. I am italain american and I have had some AMAZING italian food in my day! I would say this was good but, not  I HAVE TO GO BACK!!! A little pricey too especially for lunch... But, I did enjoy myself.

Absolute best of Surprise by far. Bill is an AMAZING AMAZING person and he is so personable every time we come in. The marcapone  isn't something I would really eat until Bill said TRY IT. I was so impressed and I crave it every day now. I love the new york and italian feel (Being both of these and being stuck in a concrete jungle this place is huge for me) I try to make it in every single weekend! They are so great with my kids too! I have been a true loyal customer since I have been a resident of Surprise... If I was ever to move back to PHX I would still come for my fix...

I drive by CCS every time I go to church and haven't paid much mind. One night we decided to finally stop in.... OMG! Amazing! It's very laid back... I didn't really goto Chuys a lot but, let me tell you CCs is where it's at this is a true Phoenix Mom and Pop GEM! I love the salsa bar and how I can keep getting up for more chips or salsa and they are very kid friendly.. The strawberry lemonade was to DIE FOR... The food is GREATLY Priced. I can not wait to go back.. Seriously they are sooooooooo much cheaper than rubios and other competitors! I love CCs! The staff was so personable and nice!!!

And I LOVED IT  The smore pizza was to die for. It's cheap... Delicious... and 100000 times better than dominos and digornio!   Also they take food stamps for those who have them!

I came in tonight and we were charged 41.63 for dinner FOUR TIMES. I find this very odd because, our server took our card for over 10 minutes and told us she had to call our bank to confirm the charge and authorize which I find VERY odd because, we haven't had any issues in Las Vegas! I am very disappointed. My husbands burrito was not the best but, my carne was decent. This was a very bad experience for us and even worse now because, I have nearly 200$ out of my account while I am on vacation and cant get ahold of anyone!

I can not even begin to say how amazing these guys are. We came down from Colorado for vacation and they fixed our iPad mini that we thought was beyond repair our daughter had TOTTALY wrecked it it looks AMAZING!!! Before I left  Colorado I also needed my screen fixed on my iPhone 5 they did such a terrible job in Colorado that I took my iPhone back to these guys and had it done right they were so amazing and helped me write a letter to dispute the bank on what the idiots did to my phone back in CO!!!! It may have cost me more $ to get it done right but I am happy and my phone is WORKING right!!!! Thank you thank you thank you guys!!! They fixed both of our apple products in under an hour!!!!
