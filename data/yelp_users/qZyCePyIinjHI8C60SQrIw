I did wait  a very long time the first time I went here, but the vet was very good and explained everything in detail once she finally came in. The second time I came (a week later) I saw a different vet and I was in and out. However, she gave me a medication that the previous vet had just prescribed and I didn't realize it until I had already paid and gotten home. I'm glad I looked at the name or I might have double dosed and maybe killed my dog! The staff was very nice and I really liked the "nurses". Much cheaper than the vets in Casa Grande. They even gave a follow up call to check on my dog after my first visit.

I love all the sides they offer, and that they give you the option to either cook the food for you or let you cook it yourself.  The chicken is my favorite of all the other Korean places I have dined, but the bulgogi is sometimes dry.  My husband is the bulgogi fan of the family and never wants to come here for that reason. The barley tea is also really good. Last time we went the service was awful though. They also changed the name but it seems to be the same menu. They still have sushi as well.

Not my favorite at all, it was just ok. I would like to try the buffet though. I just did not think the flavors were all there.

I tried to call in an order and was left on hold for over 15 mins. I finally just hung up...

My friend's and I have had breakfast and lunch here a couple of times. I like that you can call ahead and reserve a table so you don't have to wait, or you can get your order to go. They also will send you bogo free coupons to your email all the time. That being said, the food isn't very good at all. Everything is so bland, I need some flavor. My friend ordered a BLT last time we went and the waitress brought out a sandwich with just bacon with extra lettuce and walked off without an explanation. When she came back we told her it was missing the tomato, she said "yeah we are out", what? That's something you should have mentioned before she ordered it, that's a big element of a BLT to miss!

The breakfast potatoes are a must try. The sandwiches are really phenomenal too. The Chicken pesto, chicken salad sandwich, and the turkey cranberry wrap are my favorites. I usually alternate between the three. They usually have a rotating soup special, it's nice to always have something new to try. I do wish they would expand their kids menu, and add breakfast. The breakfast is very inexpensive so I usually just order that for my child, but it's a lot of food. They have ice cream, coffee, smoothies, and pastries as well. I love the special touch of a little brownie in each lunch. The whole reason I'm writing this review though, is their customer service. There is a lady named Jamie who works there, and she is just simply amazing. She always goes above and beyond and is so super friendly. She totally makes this place special for us. It's hard to find good friendly service in Casa Grande, and I find myself not going back to restaurants that have good food but bad service.

There are many furniture stores in Casa Grande but this one is by far the best. It is locally owned and operated unlike the other big box stores. I prefer to shop locally and gave this place a try. They have a great selection and can even custom order for you. If it's not in the store they can find it. Great prices and great people. Shop here first!!

Always friendly service and fresh food. Check out their secret menu, http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx  The animal style fries and burgers are the best ("Animal Style. An Animal Style burger also includes extra Thousand Island spread, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. Animal Style fries, on the other hand, are topped with cheese, spread, and grilled onions.") ! This place is always busy.You can even order a root beer float.

It wasn't open yet when we got there, but the owner came out to talk to us when she saw us standing out there and even invited us in to play and wait. Amazing!!

I think they finally have all their kinks out. Our food was ready and waiting for as right when we pulled up to the window.  Amanda was awesome, our order was correct and delicious.  The tenders are the best. All the sides are amazing, my favorites are the mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, and rice in beans. In that order.
