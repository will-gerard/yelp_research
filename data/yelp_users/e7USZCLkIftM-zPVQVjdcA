Sam is awesome. I have brought my wife's 84 Volvo in numerous times for small repairs. Sam always explains the issue and what the car needs before I get a surprise bill. Work is inexpensive and well done. He dresses very sharp and is very professional. I will never take my car anywhere else.   I highly recommend this place, not just for great prices and work, but to support a small business and a stellar guy.

This is the worst place to live. Management can give you false information about your lease and it is held up by corporate. Do not move here!!!
