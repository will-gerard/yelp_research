When I first moved to Phoenix, I was walking around the Esplanade and saw this place.  I had lived in NYC for years and had lived on Mercer street where there was a "Merc Bar" so thought I would go in and see if there was any connection.  Sure enough, this place is the 2nd location of the NYC Merc Bar.  Since I live across the street I come here fairly regularly.  I'm usually a wine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.  To their credit, their three beer tap usually has both Stella and Guinness, two of my favorites.  Nonetheless, I still have not found a wine there that I really love.  Not many people realize that they do make some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something.  And the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.  If you are on a date, the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you don't want to deal with the bar scene.

As a bachelor, I have to agree with Abu: TJ's is paradise.  It's seriously the reason I picked the Biltmore neighborhood two years ago when I moved from LA.  It made my move seamless.  I can honestly say that for the last 8 years I have been going to TJ's weekly (first in LA, and now in PHX), and perhaps a little sadly, I tend to buy the same things each and every week.  If TJ's closed, I would die.   Food: -- TJ's hummus: all of them are awesome, even the white bean hummus -- TJ's whole wheat pita bread, and the mini pitas.  Just dip these guys in the hummus (see above) -- TJ's dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).  Don't buy the more expensive canned dolmas they have from Greece.  Trust me.  TJ's is in a jar, you get a few more dolmas in there and they are firmer and don't have that old canned taste.  I think the Greek ones have been sitting on a shelf somewhere for years. -- TJ's nuts, all of them. -- TJ's frozen fish and shrimp.  They have excellent sea food and it's all been extremely good in my experience.  Their raw peeled shrimp makes for an easy meal of your choice.  I like to saute with garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice.   -- TJ's Greek yogurt.  They have a "brand" name, but stick with TJ's.  I have tried them both and still think that the house brand rules  Household Items: -- Dr. Bronner's magic soap!  This stuff is great and will make you smell good (if you don't already smell good) -- STAY AWAY FROM THEIR PAPER TOWELS.  In the last few years they seem to be carrying more household stuff, but their paper towels are worthless and actually smell kind of strange.  If you spill something and reach for a TJ's towel, the spill will get worse.  These towels repel all moisture.  Go to Target and get the real thing or use a washable dish rag. -- Desert Essence face wash.  For a bachelor, this stuff is great.  It's a simple face wash that does what it says and doesn't leave you smelling like an orchard  Drinks: -- Their juices are all amazing, especially their unpasteurized orange juice, but it's not cheap. -- Water is essential but I am a filterer at home so just buy their sparkling mineral water.  It's the best deal in town. -- Beer: They have the large bottles of Chimay, Arrogant Bastard Ale, and the usual suspects of trendy breweries such as Stone, Stella, Guinness, and some of the Japanese brands.  These are great, but my recommendation is for the Simpler Times lager.  It's only $2.99 for a 6-pack!  That's 50 cents a beer.  At first I was afraid, I was petrified...but seriously, I even served this beer to a female guest the other night and she was totally impressed.  Pour it in a pint glass and Simpler Times will stack up to the best brews. -- Wine: You have to be careful with TJ's wine.  Yes, they have some cheap wines, but you will have a serious time trying to swallow some of them.  Stick to the above $6 bottles at a minimum, and if you want to be safe, aim for the $11 plus bottles.  Also remember that southern hemisphere wines can be a bit younger because of the grow season.  For Chilean wines and Argentinian wines my price rubric can be cut in half because these countries have such low labor costs that even their cheap wines seem to be palatable somehow.  Also, those Bota boxes are convenient, but I think they taste about as good as two-buck chuck.  Someone told me they are inconsistent so I might give it another try.   Other Hints: --  If you take your own bag they will give you a raffle ticket and every week they draw a name for a $25 dollar gift certificate (don't hold me to that price, but it sounds right).  I've been playing this bag game for years at this TJ's and my prior TJ's and have never won.  It makes you realize that if you can't win a simple raffle at the local TJ's you probably shouldn't waste your money on lottery tickets where the odds are really against you.  Flowers and Plants: -- I've purchased all manner of TJ's flowers and plants over the years and find that they aren't very durable.  The flowers seem to die much quicker than the flowers you buy at the local florist and the plants are hit or miss.  If you have to buy flowers in a rush, go for it, but if you need them to stay perky for more than an day, you might go elsewhere.  That's my two cents.

I love my gym!  Prior to joining I tried out all the gyms around my house (Biltmore area).  That includes the LA Fitness by Trader Joe's and the 24 Hour Fitness on Camelback.  Each one was way too crowded for my tastes and lacked in basic human necessities (e.g. LA Fitness does not provide towels!).  I also have a lifetime membership to Bally's that my parents bought me in the mid-1990s, but there is not a decent Bally's close to my house and the closest one is just not the type of place that inspires me to want to work out.  So for a year after moving to Phoenix I debated whether to fork over the dough for the Village.  How much dough?  Well, the pricing varies but it is about 5 times as much per month as I was quoted at LA Fitness and came with a fairly large startup fee.  So far, I have found that it is worth every penny.  What do I like about it?  First and foremost, I have never had to wait to use a machine, ever.  They have so many machines, and not nearly as many members as the other clubs in the area.  During my trial period at LA Fitness, I seriously waited 5-10 minutes each time I wanted to get on a cross trainer, and then there was a time limit.  A gym is a place to work out, not a place to stand around or worry about time limits.  Second, the Village is huge: two swimming pools, endless tennis courts, indoor basketball, indoor running track, cycle studio, indoor racquetball, indoor kids area with Wii fitness, massive weight room, large stretching room, pilates studio with all kinds of human torture looking machines, yoga studio, group exercise rooms, a bar with Kilt Lifter on tap, a snack bar, indoor and outdoor lounges, TVs in all the right spots, a spa and equipment shop (and probably much more that I am forgetting).  It's physical size also doesn't say anything about the size of their programs, which range from basketball leagues, swimming, hiking, ski trips, cycling, fencing lessons, etc.  There is always something happening and there are often social activities going on that I don't partake in, but which I hear are pretty fun.  Finally, in my very humble opinion, I think they have the best schedule of group fitness classes around, taught by the best instructors in town.  I take on average 4 yoga classes per week and every class is included in the dues.  If I were to take a similar number of classes at a local yoga studio, I would easily pay double my current gym dues and would not have access to all the other great amenities.  Just joining for the yoga would save most avid yoga enthusiasts money in the long run.  As for my complaints, they are minimal.  My biggest complaint is not about the gym, but about my friends;  I wish that more of them were members!  Most of my friends seem to be LA Fitness people and just balk at the idea of paying more than $30/month for a gym.  That's just plain silly, but I understand that money is tight these days.  My only other complaint is that the classes tend to cater to an early crowd.  I will never make it to a 6:00 a.m. yoga class (who can seriously drag themselves to the gym that early?).  Like most late risers, I would prefer later classes instead.  The latest classes in the day seem to be around 6 pm, which is usually fine for me since I am self-employed, but there are days that I wish the last yoga class was at 7:30 so I would not have to brave the rush hour crowd trying to make it there.    Overall though, I'm very happy and would recommend anyone give the Village a try.  Oh, and if any of you yelpers are seriously thinking of joining and want some good karma, let me know because I can get a free month by referring you :)

This place was a great find!  It reminds me of the little Japanese places that litter LA, and for which I constantly long.  Being our first time at this place, we stuck to the basics and ordered several types of Nigiri and hot sake.  The Nigiri was excellent.  Although we tried some of the more exotic choices, we found that the basic salmon and albacore were our favorites.  Their house hot sake is also not your typical cheap and bitter California-brewed variety you get at most places.  Their's is both sweet and smooth and perfectly drinkable!  I love that they let you pick your own sake glass too.  We will definitely be back to Shimogamo!

I went here for lunch yesterday and ordered off the lunch specials menu: half sandwich and a salad for around $9.  It was ok, but nothing special.  My friend really likes this place for some reason, but I just don't get it.

Here's what you do (a variation on something I did last summer): hire yourself some free interns from ASU or U of A.  The job market is tight so they will work for free as long as they can get credit from the school.  On select days when you are craving PB, let your interns leave the office early, say around 4 p.m. but tell them they are doing such a great job you would love to take them to dinner at PB.  Tell them to go over there and get on the list and that you will be there ASAP after 5 when you close up for the day.  Your interns will be so excited to leave early and eat PB that they will gladly go down and put your name on the list right when it opens.  By the time you get there around 5:45 or 6:00, your table is ready.

Richardson's is consistently a very good restaurant.  I always find myself here with out of town guests who have never visited Phoenix, and most of the time everyone is happy.  The only thing that prevents 5 stars in my book is my most recent experience last night.  Two people in our large table ordered the same adovada dish and one person's had two tortillas on it and the other person's only had one.  No big deal.  The person who had only one tortilla asked for more and they brought out 4 more tortillas without question.  We were all happy campers.  Looking at the bill later, however, it turns out that the waiter charged our group for two side dishes of tortillas at $2 each ($4 total).  I know we are in the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression and the restaurant needs to make money, but that equated to $1 per extra tortilla.  Talk about nickel and diming.  I will, however, give our waiter kudos for working with me to make the New Mexican Platter vegetarian.  It was delicious, as usual.

This place is essentially a copy of the old Father's Office (www.fathersoffice.com) in Brentwood, CA.  It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous "Office Burger," which Delux calls the "Delux Burger."  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Father's Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you can't find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Father's Office, you're missing out.  It's like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.    Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones weren't "crispy" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).    When I go here, it's almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so it's about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Father's Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).  They also lose a star for retaining the FO prices but substituting Phoenix strip mall quality.

My friend and I had a great time here last night (Friday).  We sat at the bar and took the staff's recommendations on drinks and food.  My favorites: the spring rolls, ginger fish, grilled alligator, stuffed grape leaves, and the dumplings with wasabi!  4 out of 5 stars for being a little on the pricey side.  UPDATED: After our last visit to Sens I had to drop this place down to 1-star (used to be 4).  We made reservations in advance and were told it would be just a few minutes.  We waited at the bar for 45 minutes watching all types of tables come in and be seated immediately without reservations.  We were told it was difficult to seat a 5-top but when they finally sat us, they sat us at a 4-top with an extra chair pulled up and they had plenty of similar 4-tops available while we were waiting.  The food itself was also blah.  They put so much wasabi on the dumplings that one of our group almost got ill.  I am a huge wasabi fan, but I too had a hard time with the amount they put.  That first bite essentially killed the rest of the dining experience.  Don't waste your time or money.  UPDATED 6/12/2010: I am restoring the 4 star rating after a wonderful experience there last night.

I'm not a dessert person, so really should not be reviewing this place, but what the hay.  It's a pretty simple concept.  You grab a bucket and fill it with whatever soft serve frozen yogurt you want then put all kinds of toppings on it yourself.  They weigh the thing and you pay something like 39 cents an ounce.  The good thing about the weighing part is you can see directly how much unnecessary junk you are putting into your body, but by that time it's really too late to turn back.  When you eat your creation you will probably ask yourself why you made the choices you made, which will lead to an introspective search.  For me, a recent trip to Mojo brought back my earliest memories of eating Reese's pieces and watching E.T.  So I will say that this place has been therapeutic in reliving childhood memories.   As for the yogurt itself, Meh.  It's nothing to write home about.  The stuff seems edible enough but still comes out of a machine in an unappetizing and hard to manipulate tube-like stream.  The lighting and decor inside provides just enough distraction.  On my recent trip, the toppings area was also kind of disheveled by prior messy customers.  Call me a buffet-hater, but any time I have to reach under a glass sneeze guard to self-help myself to a communal troth of food, I can't help but lose my appetite just a little.  It met my (low) expectations, but like I said, I'm not a dessert person.

This place is legit. I would give it 5 stars if they did not have such bright fluorescent lighting, which makes the place feel like a hospital cafeteria. Beyond the aesthetics, the food is authentic and very tasty. I will definitely be back!

I love Green and this location is so much more convenient than the Scottsdale location. My only gripe is the hours. I feel like they close too early and should be open on Sundays too. Give me MORE Green please.

Hands down the best restaurant in the area. My law partner and I were so happy when this place opened and we often walk over for lunch. The service is excellent and the food is always fresh and made to order. I highly recommend the Kitchen Burger and fries, which for around $10 is the best sit down lunch around these parts.
