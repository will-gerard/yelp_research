Great deals found today.  70% off sale plus was able to use my 15% off coupon on top of that. Friendly staff. Patient at the register as I needed a couple price checks. Wide isles.  The downside was some of the price markings were confusing. And there was not a lot of staff available. A few places were messy & there was a ladder in the way.

I was invited to a Tasting which was for a student who was being tested I believe. She was perfectly on time with dishes, meals were perfect temperature. Delightful presentation and flow. Descriptions and open talk after were nice. A great experience & I will return!

Small place & I'm so glad I found it! I have stopped in twice for lunch & both times had the Greek Chicken salad. It's a big salad & so full of flavor. Best Greek Chicken salad I've had. Partially because they gave me extra feta ;)

No line. No wait. Friendly staff. Food was fresh, tasty & proportionate. They were patient with me & my kids & nice.   The location is fairly hidden in the plaza which is why no line or wait. Tables were clean. They welcome you when you walk in.

Can I give 0 stars?!?  No one acknowledged us  When I made myself known there was no smile, no common courtesy. Just a flat response of "ok well just take a seat and they will call you." Didn't take my name. Didn't ask what all I needed. Nothing. Place is hot and muggy and completely unprofessional. The staff looked like they were going to a backyard barbecue.  Nothing more.  I left.

I looove shopping at this Sprouts in my neighborhood. Always fresh produce & meats. Great weekly deals!!! I'm always rushing in & out but staff are consistently kind & knowledgeable. Register moves quick enough. Oh & the selection of breads & snacks are great as well.

Quick, easy & great customer service.  Not my part of town so didn't know what to expect. Someone greeted me at entry & directed me. No line, there were more than enough tellers open.

Attending training here. Always have the temperature set nice & classroom far away from distractions.  Nice open lobby & outdoor space to relax during breaks.

Service was excellent!  We came just before the lunch rush. Ordered the spicy chicken wrap. Apparently it's one of their popular plates.  The proportions were more than enough! The meal was so full of flavor an perfect blend of veggies & meat. Perfect timing on wait service & great friendly service.

A little wait but awesome service. Great food & good price. Server was quick and efficient. She even gave us to-go cups of our unfinished drinks. She checked on us at the right times. Food was appealing to look at & full of flavor. Coworker had a small salad with chicken added. The chicken was a larger portion. My hummus & sirloin steak was so delicious.

Hummas & Sirloin still delish. More than enough! Ask for extra feta & a to-go cup if you're like me & can't finish a drink!

This location is always slow. The lemonade tastes horrible. The driveway is odd and inconvenient. You can only make a right-hand turn on both exits.

This rating is based solely on today's experience. I went through the drive-through and there was only one other person in front of me. I clearly understood what they said on the speaker. The two ladies were nice enough out the window. They were fast and efficient. I was able to use my free beverage coupon from my rewards membership. That was easy and I paid just over a dollar for two medium drinks. Can't beat that!  I typically try to avoid this location because of past experiences. Hopefully the service stays as it was today.

Always have poor service at this location. Today the cashier was nice and patient but the rest of staff ignored me. Took forever to get order because they forgot. Coffee is always weak. Wraps were sloppy & packaging had messy melted cheese all over. If not for a doc apt down the road I would've went to another location.

This is one of the more consistent Dunkin' Donuts in my part of town. My drinks are almost always made delicious and they are very friendly and fast at the drive-through. The food is always hot and fresh! It's also a great place to meet a few friends and catch up.

Chicken strips were delicious! Fresh, crunchy, non greasy, & hot! Sauce was light & tasty. Fries were great! Not too salty, little crunch on outside & soft inside. Cool environment, completely friendly & attentive. Great first experience. Staff came to check on us an was knowledgeable about food.

Attended a Paint Nite event held in restaurant within the Marriott. Staff was super friendly & welcoming. They were patient with us & very complimentary. Waitress was familiar with craft beers avail & suggested one I'd never tried. Loved it! Chicken skewers were fresh, hot, juicy & full of flavor. Chipotle sauce was so good! I'd go back for this. Hummus was good.

Friendly & quick service.  While attending Volleyball Festival Tournament the Starbucks at Phx Convention Center had a huge line! We walked a short two blocks & found this one! Nice shades seats outside. Most importantly my drink is delicious!

What a refreshing relief!  Amazing customer service! We have been going to another location for years & never had more than mediocre service. Today we came here for the 1st time after waiting 30 minutes at the old location.  THIS will be our new location! Staff was courteous, acknowledge us, answered questions and was attentive to my kids & niece. Very personable. Went out of their way to make our experience positive and quick. We were in & out in 15 minutes.  (I will say we were the only customers there at 1:30pm.) My son has a developmental disability & the staff member engaged him in conversation. She was amazing!  Plenty of parking. Knowledgeable staff. Great location for us.  Clean and professional interior.  Staff looked presentable in business casual attire.

Hit & miss. Half our food was great, half was burnt! Some had no flavor. Coffee was room temp & Service was a bit slow. I lowered it from 3 stars to 2 because the waitress had an argument with three elderly ladies about extra fries! Not a way to get customers to come back!

Nice service. Fast & fresh.  Would've given 5 stars if my drink were in a cup with ice vs. a can of soda.  Delish French bread w/ my 3 cheese melt!!

Went through the drive through. Person on speaker wasn't rude but also not friendly. Waited a long time at the window. Two staff members were standing talking & although I realize they weren't "cooks" it didn't help my patience. Got home & everything smelled & looked delicious. Chicken strips were hot and decent sized. Double steak burger had great flavor. Buttered buns! Hot dog was decent size & taste great. Fries were thin cut & a lil salty. Very impressed with their fry dip made of mayo & ketchup & pickle juice.

First timer! I had to try 2! I ordered the Totally Green Smoothie which is so refreshing and has just enough sweetness (green apple & kiwi). It's my first time having anything with Kale & I think it's delicious! Definitely something I will try at home & have again when I'm in the area.  My second drink I wanted a yogurt blend & chose the Get Up and Goji. It's like a nice refreshment at the beach. Light & tangy & sweet with the lil fullness of yogurt.  Only reasons I didn't give 5 stars were: They only offer 1 size & it's $5 a drink.  The place is small & loud.  Customer service was ok but not great.

Came here for lunch. Parking was around/behind building so expected that downtown. The function of the restaurant is odd. Soon as we walked in there was a line. No signs explaining whether or not to seat self. There was a dirty dish cart next to us by front door. Somewhat crowded for small space.  So apparently you should: 1. Know what you're ordering. Or 2. Walk up in line to register & get a menu to figure out what you want before your turn.  When we ordered the cashier checked to see if there were rolls prepared in to-go dishes in the display next to her. Odd. I came to eat "fresh-prepared" food inside!?  As u pay the register asks for a tip. To which I asked if they would be delivering our dishes to our table. No they do not. They call your number and u walk up. Why tip? I felt obligated & tipped 10%.  Self seated in the back. It was that or by hot windows. We were next to the ice machine and makeshift storage closet with curtain. Place was warm. (It is 116* outside so pass on that.) Two rolls we ordered were great! Did not come with cucumber salad or Miso soup. You pay separately for that.  Overpriced for the overall experience. Thank goodness I had good company or I would have had a horrible time.  Probably won't go back though. I'd much rather pick up to-go sushi from Sprouts & eat at my desk.

Seated immediately. Nice decor more rustic meets modern. Set up so it's not too crowded. Cool temp not cold. Waitstaff and owner were personable and friendly. Made suggestions and were descriptive. Dolce Diavolo pizza was surprisingly delicious. Enough spice to taste the other flavors. Risotto Balls were crispy and great sauce on the side. Overall enjoyable experience & plan to come back only if they incorporate Craft Beers!!! *hint hint

First timer & I'm sure we'll become regulars! Hidden in a small plaza outside the shopping center. Staff was welcoming, friendly, extremely helpful with menu descriptions & went above & beyond. My son cannot tolerate the texture of rice. The staff recommended a chicken teriyaki wrap. I was concerned if it would fill up my 13 yr old. He said yes & I was happily surprised to see that they created a cucumber chicken roll on the side for my son. On the house! My daughter & I share a couple rolls & had to take a 3rd to go because we were full. Fresh, great texture, sauce was perfect $ portions were plenty! I actually cannot wait to go back!!

First time at this location.  Good service, friendly & patient at ordering. Quickly served despite it being super busy.  Food was hot & fresh. Only complains are it was noisy & fries were a bit too salty. And need a better selection of drinks!
