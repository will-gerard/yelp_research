This is another one of my absolute favorites in AZ. I've heard some folks pan on other boards but I just flat out don't get it. For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.  First of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.  Tortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.  I love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.    I think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.  So they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.  As far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables.   They are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think.   They're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.  I think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.  Right now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.  BTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on. Ended up with a bunch of scalding green chili in my lap my first visit.

We really enjoy Ballet Arizona productions. We recently saw The Nutcracker - an annual family tradition. They make a few modifications to the program every year. I really liked the tweaks this year. We also happened to attend a showing where Astrit Zejinati and Chelsea Wilcox doing the pas de deux. They were absolutely amazing.   Our 5 year old has also been taking ballet lessons at the school there since she was 3.  We think the school is wonderful. They teach classical ballet vocabulary from 3 years old on. They are pretty strict and have a set curriculum. They all wear the same uniform and hairstyle and are strict about it. After the 3 year old class, parent's aren't allowed to watch other than one class per session where they let us all in.   So far, from what we've seen though, the curriculum and the teachers are great. They do a lot to improve body control, teach musicality and start them on a course of classical ballet.  We're big fans.

This is a great neighborhood (though we really don't live that close) flower shop. My sister started going here years & years ago. Then I think my mom started going. Probably my other sister. Then I became a fan.  Jeff is always there. He has a great eye. He also puts up with my last minute request without issue. I know I can trust him to come up with great arrangements time & time again.  My favorite thing though is to go in there & see what he has in, look at some of the vases & suggest a thing or two. Then I let him do the magic and get out of his way. That way I end up with something a bit personal but done in great style.  The arrangements are always a great value as well. I will admit that I've even looked on-line recently (proflowers.com) but once they tack on all their add-on fees, handling fees, shipping, etc., there's really no reason at all not to go local.  Arcadia Flowers is definitely my go to flower shop.

I'm a big Liberty Market fan and way overdue on this review.   I'm also a big Joe Johnston fan. Think he's a great guy & love that he's about great AZ food, drink, coffee & gelato/ice cream - and not just his own stuff.  I've been to Liberty Market a host of times and enjoyed it each one. This past one, I went by for EVTM (East Valley Thursday Morning) and hung out with 40-50 friends & strangers.  I ate breakfast at LM for the first time and it was stellar. I got the demi-breakfast (scrambled eggs, meatball & pancake) and a bowl-a-ccino. The giant bowl of cappuccino was excellent, as is all the coffee I've had there. It was quite pretty as well with a very nice pour.   I thought the food was remarkable too - especially the scrambled eggs which were perfectly done (little bit soft) and the meatball (was hint of wonderful cheese in it - Parmigiano-Reggiano or something similar?). Super yum. While I thought the pancake was great as well, the other 2 were the standouts for me.  I also love the decor & ambiance of LM. I love how casual it is and how easy it is to feel comfortable with your family & friends. I think the ordering mechanics lend to that - you order at the counter & take your number to a table of your choice.  The building just reeks of character, with exposed brick and is beautifully decorated in kind of a retro vibe. The bathrooms are also very cool.  In past visits we've also had the meatballs, the rancher sandwich and some of the pizzas, which were all excellent.  If LM wasn't so far from our house, I know with certainty that it would be one of our regular haunts.

Went to Arizona Auto Wash and had one of the worst consumer experiences in years.   I was taking my mom's minivan in to get washed so there was a $1 upcharge. Fine.  I bought The Works wash. That is 2 grades up from their basic wash. Cost me $18.99 + tax. That's not like super cheap for a car wash, right? Could expect something? Or maybe I'm way off base.  The Works supposedly includes the basic wash, sealer wax, triple foam polish, tire dressing, air freshener, clear coat polish, deep clean dash/console/cup holders, exterior dressing, dress dash and console w/SunGuard protective coating.  So it's a minivan and we borrowed it for a trip to Flagstaff & the Grand Canyon. We have 2 little kids so went for the higher end wash. Needed a bit of TLC. Some debris on the carpet, some drippage in the cup holders, etc.  So watched the van come out of the wash and pull up to the wipe down location. Sat there for quite a while. Was even thinking that it was taking a long time but maybe they take a long time so you think you're getting your money's worth. I did notice the main guy on the car going back to the dash over and over and over again.  Then to the front windshield over and over again. Kind of seemed like he was milking it, which is fine (as long as the car was clean).  Well I had my tip ready and walked up to the car and figured I'd just check it out before handing it over.  Once I looked in, I went from surprised to frustrated to outright bitter.    The windows weren't super clean. Ok fine. Windows are a pain in the rear to clean perfectly.   There was debris, loose debris, all over the floor. I also get that stuff gets stuck in the carpet. This was not that.  Cup holders were full of debris. One of the main reasons to upgrade to "the Works" was to get the cup holders at least a once over. Both middle row chairs had been folded down. Of course they didn't bother to open them up and check. Loose debris all over the seat.  There was spillage on the walls in the back by the cup holders (kids) and spillage on the leather strip at the bottom of the sliding doors on each side. Now I don't expect them to go crazy for $20 but they didn't even try.   I ended up grabbing a rag and spending 10 minutes cleaning and wiping down the car myself.  Then I drove back over to the vacuum station and asked them to turn it on.  I spent another 5 minutes vacuuming the car. I did a little extra (pulled up the floor mats and such) but I definitely didn't expect that.  I at least expected them to get up the loose debris on the carpet, not the stuck stuff that you have to suss out with the vacuum head.  Of course when I got home later and looked in the trunk area, that hadn't been touched either.  The dash they spent so much time pretending to wipe was a mess as well. Blotchy uneven application of who knows what. Some areas had no coverage & others were almost wet.  When I was vacuuming the car, the manager on duty came over and I told him I was bitter. Told him what wasn't done and what I was doing. He took a look and agreed that it wasn't a good job.  He asked if I wanted someone else to do it. I said no and kept on.    When I was pulling out, he was standing around, didn't come up again. I drove over to him & again said I couldn't believe the quality of their work. He said next time I come, tell them his name and say he said I could get a free wash.  Sweet.  The other thing that's such a disappointment is that I've been going to this car wash for years and  years. It has been a good while since the last visit though. You can definitely tell something happened with the ownership. Lousy work and complete lack of concern. It even extends to the inside store area, looks quite run down.

Just got back from Sakana. My office is about 50 yards from Sakana Scottsdale so we go there all the time.   I actually have mixed feelings on Sakana. I know it's a great lunch spot but it might be much more than that ???  My main viewpoint on Sakana is a great lunch place with killer specials where you get excellent value for your dollar. The sushi is fresh and good. The cooked meals are great. The salads are great. Hard to beat when you're doing a lunch & want to have some reasonably healthy options. Add in the proximity and it's a no brainer.  The question in my mind has to do with their dinner options and going big on sushi. When we had them cater one of our holiday parties in the past, we had some conversations with them about what they do and got to talking about some less mainstream dishes: ankimo (monkfish liver), amaebi (sweet shrimp), etc. I didn't realize that they focused on these as well.  So a few weeks after that conversation, my wife and I headed into Sakana for dinner at one point and sat with Ray at the sushi bar. We proceeded to have a great meal. Really excellent. I was shocked as I'd always thought of it more as a "lunch spot" and wouldn't have considered it when thinking of going to my favorite spots like Yasu Sushi Bistro, Kampai, etc. Now we haven't been back for dinner since so I don't know if the stars were just aligned or if Ray was taking extra special care of us because of our discussion. So I'm hesitant to expect that we would have a similar experience just wandering in there for dinner. I need to give it another try though to find out.  So with that in mind, I cannot say they don't do great traditional, high quality sushi.   I can definitely say though that the lunches are great and the value is excellent.  From their killer deal of the Sakana lunch to the chirashi to the calimari/jalapeno salad to the chicken cutlet, I've never had a lunch there that I was really disappointed with.  It's probably our number 1 go to lunch spot. Always delivers.

I'm a fan of China Lite. It's take out focused (though has eat in option) and is healthy/semi-healthy Chinese fast food.  Our office is about 100 yards away so we go there often. Pretty much our quick & cheap go to lunch spot. Good food, reasonable, quick and they have a number of healthy options.  Feels at least partly authentic though they do also have several "American Chinese" selections (which I can also enjoy). I'm a big fan of the Szechuan green bean with chicken but sometimes need a good Sargent Chang's chicken or a honey crispy chicken.  My pops is from Canton, China so Chinese food is something we've grown up with. While it is take out/fast food focused, definitely a viable option.

I've always been a fan of Zipp's. For what it is/does, the food/drinks is great.  I find it hard to move myself off my regular order of the chicken focaccia. Just can't get enough of the garlic mayo.. I've actually been a fan of this since I found it at Goldie's, pre-Zipps way back in 1994/1995? Same folks...  Also love the cookie skillet. Good beer on tap. As far as a pub/sportsbar, just works for me.  The reason I'm commenting today is that I had a different preparation of mozzarella sticks than I have ever had. Instead of the typical batter on the outside, the mozzarella was wrapped with what I think was an egg roll skin. Looked kind of strange but for a mozzarella stick, it was awesome. Of course it's just a mozzarella stick & if you think it's going to be something transcendental, you're going to be let down. It's a good sports bar mozzarella stick though.  Just had to mention...

Hit Lo-Lo's again recently and it did not disappoint.  I definitely think this is the best fried chicken that I've ever had. Also quite enjoy the excellent waffles with it. While I'd heard of the pairing, I'd never tried it prior to going to Lo-Lo's. Just works for me.   I also ended up with 3 mason jars of Kool-Aid, which I love. As the Mrs. and her visiting friend are from Australia, they are not familiar with Kool-Aid. When it came out they said "red cordial"! Me not being familiar with this red cordial didn't know what that meant. I guess in Australia red cordial has a bad rep for inducing hyperactivity. Of course there is the sugar but then they also think the red food coloring contributes. Since we really did not need our 4 year old and 2 year old more hyper, I ended up with theirs as well. Fine with me. I will admit that I did not finish all 3. Those mason jars are huge!  The rest of the group, kids included, also love their meal.  Among us we had several different pieces of chicken (breast, thigh, wing), waffles, grits, collard greens and mac & cheese. Pretty much everything was a hit. The ladies absolutely loved the collard greens and we put away about 3 orders among the 5 of us. The mac & cheese (a JW recommendation) was also a very big hit. We also modified our grits order to no butter (not sure if that is sacrilege) and while I don't know if my mouth enjoyed it quite as much, I didn't feel like I was going to die from richness as I'd felt after the previous visit.  The staff was super nice as always and we also love the atmosphere in there. Especially liked seeing the Shaq signature on the ceiling in the room with the counter.  Ready to go back!

We went to our first show at the Orpheum Theatre last night.  I thought the theater was absolutely beautiful. I loved the intricate architecture. It felt old but stately. It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere. The sound was wonderful as well.    We saw Jake Shimabukuro, ukulele virtuoso, there. It was a perfect venue for him. So beautiful, stately, quiet with great acoustics. It really highlighted his performance.  I found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. In the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997. They brought back much of the original design (moldings, murals, etc.)  Now it's just wonderful. Anytime I see something interesting playing there, the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw. Can't wait to head back!

Big fan of Fry Bread House. I love the hominy beef stew with the fry bread. The fry bread is just flat out amazing. That stew is so good I usually burn my tongue with inadequate waiting.  I've had the tacos & they're good but tough to make me pass on the stew.  The dessert fry bread (gotta go honey w/powdered sugar) is also amazing.  Cheap & locally owned too. Gotta love that.  One of the AZ musts for folks visiting from elsewhere in my book.

I rarely write negative reviews but this location is terrible. Understaffed, undertrained. Will avoid in the future though I work nearby.

Huge, huge fan of HOER!  As has been said, there has been a change of ownership. I was never there before so don't know how that was.  I do know that I am in love with it now.  This is authentic Northern style (Shaanxi ) Chinese food. Some of the staff have limited English so probably best to come armed with some dish recommendations. Definitely look for Helen Y's review for some more ideas.   We had a variety of dishes on our first visit. 2 stood out strongly.  The Shaanxi-Style Handmade Noodle dish (#52) was fantastic. The noodles were amazing & they were topped with chiles, soybean sprouts, boy choy and vinegar. So good. A bit salty but I'm a fan of salt.  Our other favorite dish was the Hot & Sour Pork Dumpling Soup (#50). This was a recommendation from our server. This was absolutely wonderful. Excellent tasty dumplings with lovely wrappers (that would have been great on their own) in a yummy broth with vinegar, sesame oil & lots of cilantro. This was brilliant. I saw after we ordered that they also have this dish with lamb dumplings.   We also had the Shaanxi Pan-Fried Noodles (#54) on a recommendation from our server. A nice dish. A bit sweet, a bit of heat (sliced jalapenos), pork & onions. I like these noodles but liked the handmade noodles in the first dish even better. Definitely nothing to sneer at.  And then our first recommendation from our server after pointing at the Shaanxi-Style Handmade Noodles was Kung Pao Chicken (#30). It was good but we couldn't get over some of the other dishes. We'll be digging more on the noodle side in future visits.  On our second visit, we had to get the Hot & Sour Pork Dumpling Soup again and it was as amazing as the first time.  We also ordered the Tomato Egg Soup (#14). This was lovely. I'm glad it came out before the hot & sour dumpling soup as its flavor was far more delicate. I'd be happy to eat this again for certain.   More exploring to come!  Pretty much pining to return as soon as I stepped out the door both visits. And I want to go right now too!

I am a huge fan of The Orange Table and have been forever. One thing though, don't come here if you're in a hurry.  While the service is always quite slow and everything can take forever, the food is awesome.  They make everything from scratch and use ingredients of killer quality. I've never had a dish that I didn't completely enjoy.  My favorite is likely the white flannel. It is a corned beef hash (sliced corned beef) with garlic, mushrooms and sour cream. This dish is my absolute favorite breakfast in the state. Love it. And the ladies in the family are also extremely passionate about the green flannel. Another corned beef hash version with jalapeños. Quite tasty but too much for my sissy tongue.  As far as lunch, they have excellent burgers but the Loki always comes to mind. The Loki is a corned beef sandwich with these amazing pickled onions and slices of jalapeños. It's almost on the edge of too hot for my sissy tongue. In fact it is too hot. It's just so dang tasty that I force myself through the pain though. So many other great sandwiches as well. I even love the way they slice their chicken for sandwiches. While not in my wheelhouse, the Mrs. just loves their veggie dishes as well.    Then my favorite drink is the coffee soda. This is absolutely amazing. They make their own espresso syrup. I've been told it takes 40 shots of espresso and then they reduce it. They add this to soda water and you can add other things like cream, vanilla syrup, etc. I have a definite sweet tooth so I always go cream and vanilla syrup. It is a great combination of soda, intense espresso flavor and sweetness. I can't get enough of this.   The coffees, lattes, etc. are also excellent. They have a great microbrew list and a killer selection of boutique root beer.   My big piece of information is that you don't want to go here if you're in a hurry. If you have nowhere to go and you can settle in & hang out, it's tough to beat OT for breakfast or lunch.

CLOSING:  Sea Saw is closing with the last service on Sunday, June 7th, 2009.  http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2009/05/its_official_sea_saw_is_closin.php  We are totally bummed as Sea Saw has been our favorite restaurant in the state. Luckily it looks like Nobuo-san is staying in AZ and opening a new place in Phoenix.

Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.  Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.  And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette).

Also subject to unannounced rate increases.  Put up with it for years but will be moving out now.   Over a 48% net increase over 3 1/2 years.   Look elsewhere.

Went to a family event at Fuddruckers this week. Have a relative who digs it. Going there just gives me the willies.   It definitely seems to have been cleaned up a bit from the last time we went. It was dirty, nasty the previous time. Little bit of solace in that. DIdn't seem as dirty. They'd reupholstered the booths with the torn vinyl. They'd gotten rid of the cracked & torn vinyl red & white striped tablecloths. Still cracked & old formica but it didn't seem as dirty.  As far as the food, I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good. Ok, but nothing special at all. The fries weren't great either. In years past, I was a big fan of the plastic cheese in the heated cheese fountain but not so much either. After it cools a bit, it's just nasty.  I will go back when future family events require & maybe with less trepidation but I still wouldn't go there by choice with other good options nearby.

This is my favorite of similar type places by far. We used to Los Betos at the end of nights on the town & in a pinch when we didn't want to cook (as there is one quite near). At some point, the quality had dropped far enough that we hit Fiesta Burrito. My sister had been lauding this place for years.  Well, it is not only my favorite drive-thru/semi-fast Mexican food spot, it's one of my favorite value places in town. Cheap great food super quick. It's already kind of a stand by for me & the kids when the Mrs. does a girls night out. Also open quite late which is a major bonus (as both of my other cheap Mexican favorites have limited hours - Carolina's & Rito's).  Their food is excellent. Super tasty, reasonable, quick. Nice clean atmosphere, super friendly staff.  I typically go with the taco combination as they do the deep fried shredded beef tacos that are so yummy. Their carne asada is also brilliant. Great beans. They have a nice salsa bar as well. The Mrs. likes the green & red chile quite well too.  Can't miss with Fiesta Burrito.

Had some apps & drinks here a couple nights ago. They have a really nice patio & it's a pretty nice location.  I'm all about food though.  We had mini chimis, beef taquitos & spinach artichoke dip - nothing sexy. Seemed like the mini chimis & taquitos likely came frozen in a huge bag - have enjoyed ones we've gotten in the frozen section of the supermarket more. The spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too. Tasted predominately of cream/sour cream without much flavor.   Would go back for a social thing but if we ordered food here, definitely would try something different.

I'm a fan. We hit Caffe Boa this past Sunday for brunch. Was a bit bummed to not have the full menu but the food we did have was quite good.  I also saw that they were members of the Slow Food movement. Definitely a good start.  Began with a pitcher of sangria made with white wine. Was quite refreshing and tasty. Later swapped to red wine sangria made and was also quite good. Definitely give a look to the Sunday 1/2 price sangria pitchers and the bottomless mimosas & bellinis.  As far as the food, I ordered the eggs benedict. The major difference was that the eggs were over a nice layer of San Daniele prosciutto. Killer dish. Eggs were poached perfectly. The prosciutto was a killer touch. Hollandaise was super yummy. It also came with a side of a couple slices of excellent tomato topped with a mound of burrata/mozzarella - hard to tell.  Tasty.  Would gladly order again. The Mrs. got the garlic egg scramble with salmon. That was also very good. The bread accompanying was great and a nice compliment.  We also had our 2 & 5 year olds with us and it was a good spot for them. Was able to sandwich them on a long booth & worked out perfectly.  Will definitely be back to sample more off the regular menu.

Lux is one of my favorite businesses in Arizona.  I think Lux is an amazing example of authentic excellence. Whenever I think about branding, Lux always comes to mind as a great example. They know exactly what they are. They don't try to be anything else. They do an amazing job of executing every part of who they are.  First of all, the coffee rocks. They roast their own beans and are our favorite in town. Then the drinks they make are not only delicious but also beautiful. So many nice touches. Latte art. Homemade whipped cream with a touch of  honey. Sugared rim & slice of lemon on the lemonade. Fresh squeezed juices. McClendon Farms honey as a condiment. They serve their drinks in china & glass (cool non-institutional mugs & glasses) if you're drinking there. They even have killer lids for their to go coffee. Their straws are super thick & you never have to worry about them getting crimped.  If it didn't all taste good, I guess it wouldn't matter. But it does & every little aspect adds to the experience for me.  Same with their food. Great snacks. Served on china. Heated & served with a slab of real butter if it's supposed to be.  Cool decor. Changing local art on the walls. Great music playing. Free wifi.  The only thing that bugs me at all about Lux is how crowded it's become. In the scheme of things, I guess that's good because we know Lux will be around & it also says a lot for the taste of Phoenicians.  I have heard one other criticism - that the folks there can be snooty. I myself have never seen that & experienced the absolute opposite time after time. I often come with 2 little kids too so I'd expect if anybody was going to get the snoot, it'd be me.  I just plain love Lux. If it were closer to my house, I'd be there even more.

My pops is from Canton, China & this is the place he wanted to go for his birthday.  So that's saying something. It's definitely good. Since migrating from China Doll when I was a little kid (30 something years ago), we've been all over. Did a long stint at C-Fu but now it's Tao Garden and China King for us.  We've had stellar meals in the past here and our most recent was good but not mind blowing. Still solid though.  Seems like a lot of places have fallen off recently which is a major bummer.   Seafood tofu soup was great. Peking duck was good but just felt a bit clumsy (super thick pancakes, chunks of duck - made me pine for San Fran or even LA). Chinese fried chicken was good as always. Steamed fish was nice. Empty heart ? (some type of veg) was good. Beef chow fun was tasty but light on the beef. And beef & green beans w/XO sauce was good.  Service was uneven as usual but it's a Chinese restaurant so I expect such.  With some of the other stellar food we've eaten recently, I just wish we had a Phoenix Chinese spot that was fanatically committed to excellence as some of our other local faves are.

Returned to Tao Garden for the first time in a while. I was so bummed.  This used to be our go to Chinese dinner spot. As I mentioned my dad is from Canton, China & good Chinese food is an important thing in our world.  Was just underwhelmed on so many levels. We had a series of dishes (Chinese fried chicken, roast duck, salt & pepper pork, tofu/bak choy dish, greens, veggie chow fun, beef chow fun, seafood soup).   Didn't think anything was stellar and so many of the dishes paled in comparison to previous experiences.  I'm a big fan of chow fun. Just didn't really make an impression. We've also had great fried chicken & roast duck here in the past but they weren't executed well.   Could just be a bad night but didn't feel like it. Not sure that we will be racing back soon. : (

First of all, this has nothing to do with Tapino's food or service. It may be great. In fact, that's what we were hoping.  Secondly, we are big fans of what Chef Porter is trying to do. We have great respect for them advocating the locavore movement & using local farms & vendors. We're huge fans of local farmers markets & buy all our produce there. We're also huge fans of local independent restaurants & business and patronize them as much as possible.  So the birthday fail begins...  One more thing. Birthdays in my family are a big deal. Food is a big deal. We all grew up working in my dad's restaurant (the Glass Door) & food is hugely important to us. For birthdays, we do a fancy dinner & a family dinner. This was a family dinner. Lots of thought goes into choosing the place for each occasion. This was also my wife's birthday. Kind of a big deal for me.   For family dinner, we all go so we need a place that isn't too hard on the budget & that suits different dietary needs (some vegetarians, some food allergies). Looked at a ton of places & figured that we should try Tapino as they had a great food/drink special & we were into what they are doing. Figured it would be a gateway meal to us coming back a great deal more.   Ok, very last thing, kids... So we brought our kids. We've brought our kids out to eat since they were born & they know & appreciate good food. They've been places like Sea Saw, Nobu, Bouchon, etc. They know how to behave & are always expected to behave.  So to the story...  Called Tapino yesterday & spoke to the manager & asked if they could take a party of 12 for happy hour. She said they normally don't take reservations for happy hour but would be ready for us. Asked if they had 2 high chairs for the kids. She said no but they had low chairs & low tables on the patio that would work great. So we're in good shape, right?  Well today, I walk in myself (without kids) & say that we are here for the party of 12 w/kids. The hostess said no kids allowed in bar nor on patio (as they allow smoking on the patio) & they don't serve happy hour in the restaurant & just lets it sit at that. Pretty weird. Was almost as if they'd were ready for us.   Ok, so if you don't want kids in your place...at least tell us. I dragged 12 people out & set their expectations & was excited to have the perfect place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Then we get there & you say sorry, nope?  Also, there wasn't a single person in the restaurant at this time. It was about 5:45. Not one.  I'm like in shock so I tell her I spoke with someone yesterday & she understood our situation & that we were coming in. She said that she was right there when I spoke with her manager & they don't allow kids in the bar or on the patio & they don't do happy hour in the resturant. Ok, I get it. Probably heard this 7 times when I was there.  Might as well have said go away, leave, we don't want you here.  She eventually said that the manager was there & she'd have her come talk with me.  During the wait, I asked about last night's locavore dinner & told her we were excited to be there as we'd been following them on Chowhound & the Phoenix Hound Gathering group. Also told her I'd been talking with one of the farmers that was in for the previous night's event. Basically I let her know we know what they did & were into it. Might have factored in a bit? Nope.  Eventually, the manager came out & they chatted.  The manager then came over & changed the story & said we could sit in the bar at a couple of benches but kept reiterating that the kids couldn't make any noise nor move around at all. Ok, fine. First of all, we expect the kids to behave. If she'd left it with one mention, maybe we'd have just sat down. But with repeated mentions of no noise, no moving around, it was obvious they didn't want us there. I told her I felt that way & she said that wasn't the case but it rang quite hollow.  I went outside to talk with the family & figured we'd probably go elsewhere as we really weren't wanted. Went in to tell the hostess (manager was nowhere around) & got a perfunctory sorry.  Just seems like such a customer service failure. If they'd wanted us there, they could have refrained from making us feel unwelcome. Or if they were uncomfortable with kids being in the bar or on the patio, they could have easily set us up in the empty restaurant & offered us the same food/drink.  Or they could have told us their mantra "no kids in the bar or on the patio, no happy hour in the restaurant" on the phone.   Maybe it was a bad situation for them but if it were me, I would have tried a little bit harder to find a solution that wouldn't have so alienated us.  I don't know. I'm epxecting to see Chef Porter at OTFM & am friends with people who work with him & maybe we'll come back (sans kids of course) but right now it sure doesn't feel like it & it's a major bummer as Tapino seems like a place that is doing excactly what we love & we could have been huge fans.

I'm a cheesesteak freak. I do admit that I am not from Philly so my take is purely with regard to what tastes good to me.  As far as this place, I'd been wanting to go here for a long, long time as I'd heard a number of good reviews on it. We hit it last night after the Yelp Rocks! event and I was pretty let down. I got a cheesesteak with wiz and and an order of fries.    As far as the cheesesteak itself, it was ok. Nothing stellar though. The bread was good. I was pretty let down on the meat though. It had a good amount of gristle in it & was quite chewy. I also wasn't a big fan of the wiz. Now I'm not sure how this works but I thought the wiz was the easy part. I LOVE wiz on a cheesesteak. Figured you just order the giant cans of Cheese Wiz, open them up, heat & ladle it on. It didn't taste like straight wiz to me. Almost seemed like it was a wiz based cream/cheese sauce or something???? Just give me the straight wiz, please.  Then the fries... Don't all cheesesteak places have great fries? The fries were awful. They were soggy & grease laden. I NEVER leave fries on the plate & actually dumped 1/2 the order. Super disappointed in the fries...  I feel bad because I'm a big, big fan of cheesesteaks and had heard such good things. We also live quite close and I love any place that is open late/all night. Maybe my expectations were out of whack. I don't know. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be in a hurry to head back.

I swung by The Roosevelt recently for the first time. I totally dug it. First of all, I love the little brick house. The structure, the exposed brick and the decor give it a great vibe.  They had some great beer on tap - I tried the house brew which I believe is a Four Peaks? It was great.   Then I struggled with my order. I need to try the grilled cheese and tomato soup as I've heard such great things about it. Instead I got the chorizo and manchego cheese over toast. Not bad. I probably would have been in love with it if the toast were actually toasty. It seemed much more than toast. I also had the dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with Parmigiano-Reggiano. These were ridiculous. Amazing flavors, rich, yummy. I'd be ecstatic with a couple orders of these and the house beer.  I definitely need to go back soon and try the grilled cheese and tomato soup and the pretzel as I've heard so much about them.  My first visit definitely made a fan of me though and I will be happy to head back as soon as possible.

Had a wonderful meal at Yasu this weekend.  I'm already a huge fan but it's nice to see that it never disappoints. With Sea Saw closing, it's definitely my favorite place for Japanese food in town and one of my very favorites regardless of type.  The last few times we'd gone, we went omakase and had a variety of of his excellent sushi and creative cooked dishes. We love the Sumibiyaki (nice to get Wagyu too) and can never get enough foie gras.  For some reason tonight, we ended up doing mostly sushi (which I also always love).  I also typically sit at the sushi bar and as I was with friends, we were at a table this night.  At Yasu, if you're not doing omakase, you've gotta start with the specials handout.  We stared there & barely left it. It's hard to resist when you know that is what the chef recommends that day.  We started with a killer red snapper carpaccio drizzled in hot sesame oil, soy sauce, and ginger. Superyum...  Then we did a series of nigiri sushi: bluefin toro, kampachi, aji, Chilean abalone, uni, live amaebi. Everything was wonderful. Super fresh. Amazing. If I had to pick favorites, would go with the uni, live amaebi and the Chilean abalone.  We also did a plate of yellowtail sashimi w/sliced jalapeno. Yummy.   And then we finished off with a chef's special dish of seared salmon wrapped around shiso, some julienne radishes, etc. It was also topped with ponzu sauce. Wonderful dish.  Anyway, it's only been 3 days and I already feel like I'm way overdue for my next visit.

I know it's a chain but I can't help but love it. Went here for a quick Father's Day drive through bite with the kids.  The first big thing about In-N-Out that I've always loved is that they actually listen and speak with you when you're at the drive through.  They do their greeting and then actually respond to what you say. They're actually listening and interacting. How cool is that for a drive through? I've seen that from time to time at individual locations of other chains but it's pretty much standard here.  Love that.  Then I also love the fact that they're pretty transparent. It's quite cool that they have the big window walls all through the drive through so you can actually see what's going on. I love the fact that they want you to see what they're doing and what the kitchen looks like. It's also way better than looking at a cement wall.  I also love that the food is made to order (no tomatoes, yes onions) every time. And I love the fact that they use quality ingredients (fresh vegetables, fries being just potatoes run through the slicer, fresh ground beef, etc.).  Then I love the fact that they give you a box if you're going to eat in your car and also that they cover your fries with a napkin. Just little touches like that show that someone actually was a bit into what they were doing when they set this business up.  And then, I just love the payoff of the double double and the fresh cut fries. For a quick drive through, can't beat it.

Had a wonderful lunch here the other day.   Great club sandwich, great lobster bisque, great lemonade...  Service was great as well. It also has a very cool, relaxed vibe up there.  The highlight is DEFINITELY the view though. Up on the 37th floor, the view is absolutely amazing. You can see the city extend in all directions with the various mountains poking up from the horizon.  I could sit up here all day and just look out the window. Great spot!

So we've had some very good food at Nee House but I just don't care.   It's the fried rice..... I'm a fried rice junkie. Ever since I was a kid. I'm 1/2 Chinese and grew up in AZ. I remember fried rice at China Doll from my very early days.  Nee House's fried rice is probably the best fried rice I've ever had.   My dad is from Canton, China, and he favors the salted fish and chicken fried rice. While I love that, I have to disagree and go with the crab and dried scallop fried rice.  It is nice though to always get both & have a bit of each.  If you're eating in, they also have live seafood tanks so definitely don't ignore those.  Most of the time though, whenever I'm within stopping distance, I'm calling in fried rice orders and grabbing an order (or two) of each to bring back home to php and my family.

This review is years overdue. I forget Yelp is for businesses beyond restaurants at times.  I'm obsessed with the Phoenix Knife House. I need to go there every once in a while just to hang out (and I always have to buy something). I've bought many a present here and I'm always itching to buy another knife for the house.   Phoenix Knife House carries Japanese chef's knifes - which are only sharpened on one side. They're ridiculously sharp and so cool. We have a killer set of Wusthof's that we got for a wedding present that we don't really use anymore. And we just have a few knives from PKH. While we don't need anymore really, I have to get another soon. I'm going for the Sugimoto 8" chef's knife.  While they have some amazing, high end works of art (Damascus steel & such), they also carry a good selection of great knives that are super affordable.  Eytan, the owner, carries knives in typical Western shape and traditional Japanese form. He also has a bunch of killer kitchen tools. Absolutely love the kitchen shears he told us to get long ago and was excited to pick up a nice fish spatula recently.  This happens to be the place where many of the valley's local chefs do their knife shopping. Eytan has also expanded to carry some additional chef supplies so head over there if you need a chef's coat or clogs as well.  In addition to being an authority on knives, he's a master sharpener. He sharpens all kinds of knives, is super reasonable and has a quick turnaround.  In addition to the awesome product he has, Eytan is a major foodie. He is a former chef (SCI grad I think?) who worked at amazing places like Kai, Circa 1900, opened Fiamma here and did time in New York at spots like Aureole, La Côte Basque, and Craft.  He is also a great guy and a wealth of information on the local food scene. I'm always following up on  his recommendations.  Even if you have nice knives, you should check it out. Might get converted like I did!

How can you not love Hot Dog on a Stick?   From the killer uniforms, fresh squeezed (in the barrel with the plunger stick) lemonade/limeade/cherry limeade to the cheese on a stick, what's there not to like?  I'm a major cheese freak, with some of my favorites being Brillat Savarin, Haystack Peak, Humboldt Fog goat cheese, 5 year aged Gouda, Parmigiano-Reggiano but that doesn't mean that I can't still dig good ole American cheese. Major comfort food for me. And a stick of American cheese battered with corndog batter goodness & deep fried until it's all gooey inside? Come on... You can also get it with pepper jack but that just doesn't do it.  So every time I find myself in a food court with a Hot Dog on a Stick, I must succumb to a fresh squeezed limeade and a cheese on a stick (American of course).  Life is good.

Ok, I give up. I had a previous review of Andreoli that I gave 3 stars. They probably didn't care anyway. I gave it a lower rating because of the lack of service.  At this point, I just don't care. I've been back to Andreoli for lunch a couple times in the past couple of weeks and the food is just so good it doesn't matter. I also didn't have a repeat of the wait from hell so maybe that's helped change my mind?  The first visit back, I went with Giovanni's recommendation (which I'd heard from Eytan over at Phoenix Knife House) of the Mortadella (kind of similar to bologna but so much better) sandwich. Just Mortadella & nothing else. It was killer. Loved it. I've never had a bad sandwich all the times I've been there. Their bread is killer. Always nicely dressed. The salad that comes alongside is wonderful. Can't go wrong. I was with 7 people and they all loved their food.  We also did a number of orders of the patatine fritte (fried potatoes & leeks). They're pretty much the best french fries ever. I also ordered some mozzarella in carrozza (fresh mozzarella and bread dipped in batter and sauteed). That was quite nice too.   Washed it all down with a Limonatta.  My last visit, I had the ridiculous fried potatoes & leeks of course and they were awesome. I did the arrapato sandwich (breaded pork loin with arugula and parmigiano). Stellar again.  So I just give in & admit that I'm addicted to the food at Andreoli and am already overdue for my next visit.

It's been a while since I hit Roka Akor. Didn't do a full dinner so it's hard to do a comprehensive review. Hit Roka for #evfn and the happy hour menu and drinks.  It's definitely a gorgeous space. I love the lines, the materials used in the building and the decor.    As far as food, just did a couple rolls - the hamachi serrano chili roll & the soft shell crab roll. Both were quite good and quite affordable.  With regard to drinks, started with a shochu sampler. It came with honey-comb shochu, grape shochu (I think) and pinenapple shochu. They were all quite good. I definitely enjoyed them all but a couple of folks at the table thought the honey and pineapple versions were a bit sweet. Tasted a friend's tanuki peach. That is a dangerous drink. I'm sure it has shochu in it as advertised but neither of us could detect any alcohol. Could definitely get you in trouble. After that had a glass maze (shochu, lychee juice and ylang-ylang). Not sure what ylang-ylang is but it was quite good. I'm a big fan of lychee. I also tried a friends poochie-poochi (sparkling nigori sake). That was killer as well.  Service in the Shochu Lounge was also quite excellent.  Overall the experience was great and has further convinced me that we need to return and take a serious run at the food.

Roka Akor isn't my typical type place. I usually find that the food I love comes from places where they have put their heart and soul into the food and just ground it out. Sometimes these places look nice but often they're not too fancy and they rarely look anything like Roka Akor.   Roka Akor is beautiful and huge. The decor is modern and tasteful. They have a great lounge, a huge featured sushi and robata bar and oodles and oodles of wood (which I dig).  So often when you see these huge, gorgeous spaces obviously funded by a good deal of investor money, it's all business driven and the organization has lost some focus on the food.  That's not the case with Roka Akor. I've been there the past 2 nights (and before) for their happy hour and had some stellar dishes.  I'm a Japanese food freak so anything new & out of the ordinary piques my interest. I've been waiting forever to have a real izakaya or kaiseki place in Phoenix.   Roka Akor is rolling out an izakaya concept in their lounge. For this first week, they are also doing a special where all food and beverages are $2 (through 11/25). It's absolutely crazy not to check this out.  While I wouldn't say this an authentic izakaya, I'm a big fan of what they are doing. I tried most of the izakaya menu over the past two days and had some killer dishes.  The tenkatsu fried pork belly is completely ridiculous. It is right up there with some of my favorite bites in recent memory. Then I also had their burger on a homemade sesame bun. Definitely order this medium rare. We had a couple ordered medium temp that came a bit overdone. The meat was tasty though and the thing that put it over the top was the awesome bun. Super flavorful - absolutely made the dish. They also use this bun on the cremini mushroom burger with wasabi aioli. Also very nice. Last night I also got to sample their Chinese style glazed pork ribs off the normal menu - amazing. I was already completely stuffed but it still made a huge impression.  As far as other things on their izakaya menu, I'm a big fan of hamachi kama and enjoyed their version. Would have been killer with a bit of ponzu sauce. Robata grilled unagi was very nice and the fried soft shell crab with mixed salad greens was excellent. We also enjoyed the butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu. The list is getting long but we really didn't run across any major misfires at all. Enjoyed the sweet corn tempura with sea salt, braised short ribs with daikon, agedashi tofu & hamachi serrano chili roll.  For me the definite standout was the pork belly though. I kind of went through that list in order of preference. I enjoyed it all - actually a bit surprising.  They also have a bunch of great drinks. Over the past 2 days, I had the shochu & tonic (barley shochu with spash of yuzu juice and tonic), tanuki peach (again - shochu & fresh peach puree) & sake-tini (lychee). All were great.   The last several visits there we've also had excellent service. The staff has been super nice and super attentive. We even brought our young kids (5 & 2) after calling & making sure it was alright. While they are very well behaved, it is still nice to see them welcomed in.  I expect that this happy hour will stay in the rotation. Great food, great drinks. Nice value.  And I also have seen some wonderful looking sushi come out as well so we have to come back and go that route.  While it doesn't look like the places that fall into the norm of what I typically like, I can't help but be a big fan.

We are huge fans of Cartel Coffee Lab.   The Mrs. is a coffee nut so we drive all over in search of the best cup and the best beans. It is one of our two very favorite places.  First of all, their coffee beans...  We are firm believers in getting beans that are locally roasted. We've subscribed to the belief that flavor is lost  as you get too far out from the roasting. Cartel roasts their own and does a ridiculous job. They do a great decaf and a number of interesting and excellent regular varietals. If you don't already buy locally roasted beans, do yourself a favor and give Cartel's a shot.  As far as their in-house coffee drinks, the Cartel folk are pretty much obsessive in their pursuit of excellence. You won't find the million varieties of crazy drinks they now do in many coffeehouses but  you will find excellent drinks done by people who are serious about what they are doing. I for one, am happy to roll with their recommendations when I am there and enjoy my whole milk, leaded latte with agave syrup.   They also have a Clover machine (which many say does the best brewed coffee) which does 1 cup at a time. You will also see the beans individually packaged for the clover right nearby. One of the philosophies the folks there have expressed is that you want to get the beans brewing as soon after grind as possible. They've even minimized the number of steps you have to take to do this.  Cartel Coffee Lab is also a very, very cool place. It's kind of tucked away in a strip mall off University back behind Eastside Records. They've taken this industrial space and kept some of that which adds to the charm and also have put very cool local art throughout. Some of it changes which is also nice. They've also fabricated some things like the bar and space dividers which give it a neat look. Their roaster also sits out in full view. In addition to all this, they always have great music playing. Something about sitting down on one of those couches with their background music instantly relaxes me.  And the last bonus for me is that with them being so obsessive about coffee, they also sell some great equipment in the front. We bought our burr grinder from them and couldn't be happier.  About the only thing about Cartel that is disappointing to us is that they have recently stopped pulling decaf espresso shots. From what I understand, this happened because they switched their grinder system out for a better one. I hope at some point, they decide to grab one of their own burr grinders for sale and reverse this change.  If you haven't tried Cartel Coffee Lab yet, it's a must.

I'm way overdue on writing a review for Digestif so I must post something. I've been putting it off to do it justice with specific references to dishes but need to just post.  Suffice to say that Digestif is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere & I'm calling it now that it's just a matter of time before Payton Curry has a  Beard award. May be an early call but I'm sticking by it & check back with me in a couple years.  We've always been are big fans of the Kasperski restaurants (Sea Saw, Ciao, Kaz) so have been going to Digestif ever since it opened. I liked the food right away & have always been a fan.  I also think they have great, interesting drinks which is a bonus.  Toward the end of December we had a meal there that caused a major paradigm shift though. While we were fans of Digestif, I'd always thought of it as a bit of a "scene" place. Anyway, we'd done our company Christmas lunch there & had a bunch of great drinks so the Mrs. & I decided that for our anniversary we were going to go have a couple drinks, some apps & then hit a movie.  Well we did have some apps & some drinks & they were wonderful - so much so that we decided to head back after the movie for more. At t his point, I think the killer drinks might have been the initial draw. We loved the fennel & beer pork sausage, the Segwey martini & the Chartreuses.  When we got back, the bartender we were sitting with had cashed out so we were sat with Joshua. Turned out to be amazingly lucky. Joshua is a food psycho (in the best way). Former cook/chef at crazy name places across the country. Well, we pretty much put ourselves in his hands & had a mind blowing meal. Made me feel terrible for ever thinking of Digestif as a "scene" place & elevated it instantly up to the level of my very favorite restaurants in the state.  Some of the highlights of that meal were unbelievable foie gras. I mean La Belle Farms foie is always wonderful so how could it really stand out, right? It just did. The preparation was amazing. Rabbit confit & persimmon - absolutely love this dish. I've not been able to go back since & not order this. Pate was amazing. I'm pretty much just completely blown away with Digestif's charceuterie. Can't get enough of it. The burrata brushettone was amazing as well. The deserts (we already love Tracy Dempsey from Sea Saw & other) were also amazing, that night specifically the butternut squash & ricotta fritters. So good. We also did a bunch more cocktails (absinthe, chartreuses, gin sling, negroni) that were fun & wonderful.  Since then, we've been back and had matching experiences. Other standouts for us are the carrot fettucini w/lamb, Niman Ranch pork chop and the brownie & chocolate malted semifreddo - looks like just a brownie sundae but oh no...  I also love, love, love the fact that Payton Curry, Tracy Dempsey, Pavle Milic & a bunch of the other Digestif staff are at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market) weekly. So cool to be able to talk & interact with them, eat their food in an uber casual way & get tips. Helps unbelievably that they are ridiculously nice & personable.  Huge, huge fan.

The Mrs. had a hankering for fish & chips so we decided to try a nearby local place we'd been wondering about for a while. It was formerly another bar but not too long ago changed into an English pub. We've been in the strip mall a million times but hadn't tried it since the change or in its previous incarnation.  Walking up, it looked pretty cool. They have a small patio that had a firepit (portable) outside that was lit. As it was a bit rainy & chilly, looked pretty iniviting. With the 2 small kids, we headed inside though.  Inside was interesting as well. Huge circular bar in the middle of the restaurant was definitely the most prominent feature. It had a very casual vibe, TVs showing sports throughout, and posters giving it some English character. It was quite busy and the crowd was very mixed. After being there for a good while, the Mrs. & I agreed that it was an interesting place to people watch. There were a good number of seniors concentrating on their food, some super casual young folk drinking & hanging out & some middle aged folks that looked to be kind of on the prowl. Definitely had a huge local feel. The server said they have a ton of regulars.   As far as the food, we did 3 orders of the fish & chips (cod). They also had a couple walleye dishes. The fish & chips were great. With the Mrs. being from Australia, fish & chips are a big thing. Totally got her approval. In recent visits to places we've really liked in the past, we've come across dry fish with way too much batter. This definitely wasn't the case. The fish was moist, mild & tasty. The batter was light but crispy. Just right. The server said the owner was from York and they make their batter the traditional way every morning. The fries also passed the Aussie test. Nice big "chips". Malt vinegar, HP & the other necessities were also available. They also had some nice beer on tap (Boddington's & Tetley's were 2 that stood out in my mind).  They also had some other interesting things on the menu that we need to go back & try: Scotch egg, shepherd's pie, bangers & mash, bangers, beans & chips. No pasties or sausage rolls.  All in all, it was a good time & we'll definitely be heading back.

I am way overdue at writing a full review on NOCA but must post this.  Had read a good deal about the Wagyu pastrami & have been unable to get it out of my brain. My sister & brother-in-law were heading to NOCA tonight so I told her she must get it.  Ok fine, end of story, right? Nope. My subconscious kept churning all night & on the way home from our first Yelp event, we had to detour by NOCA for some Wagyu pastrami of our own. Called Eliot & said they could do to go. Got there & it was packed - nice to see as it shows Arizonans have good taste. Saw my sister & bro-in-law & actually got an early taste of it but mainly tried to stay out of the way.  Ended up getting our to go order, ducked into Bashas to swipe some to go silverware (we're very classy) & jumped into the car. Opened up the box & started salivating immediately.  Two gorgeous hunks of Waygu. With reading the descriptions I had, I really had no idea what to expect. Thought maybe it'd be sliced pastrami piled up or something. Nope. It was definitely Waygu in all its glory. Still intact. It just additionally had a beautiful pastrami crust on it.  It was amazing. Luscious, tender, flavorful, amazingly rich. Wonderful pastrami accent but definitely didn't overwhelm the meat.  Came over crispy whole grain mustard spatzle with a little horseradish crema on top.  Flat out amazing. Love NOCA.

Hit this place originally after reading Eliot Wexler's review in Edible Phoenix. If Eliot likes something, odds are that I'm going to follow right along. Was definitely the case.  Was driving by tonight at 1:00 am & just had to stop again. Quick hit for a hot dog with everything - bacon, mayo, beans, tomatoes and onions on a soft bun/roll.  Piled on my condiments of choice, canned mushrooms - lots of them (just got to love the canned mushrooms), guacamole, cheddar, cotija & salsa.   Powered down while there, including retopping the dog countless times with my falling condiments. So yummy.  Just a great end to a great night.

We are big fans of OTFM!  We had been going to the Phoenix Downtown Market on Saturdays for a year + now & love it. It's just a bit of a hike for us. We also participated in Maya's Farm's CSA the last go around & have been missing our market visits.  Well, we've been going religiously to OTFM now for some time & pretty much cannot miss it.  It just continues to get better & better (and more & more crowded).  McClendon Farms has a big spread there & the produce is awesome. They have enough variety that we don't even have to supplement produce purchases with supermarket visits at all.  My other favorite thing about OTFM is that they have GREAT food.  Highlights for me:  -Payton Curry is typically there (some representative of Digestif always is) & has killer dishes. We've had awesome chili, wonderful frittatas & even fresh hand pulled mozzarella with bagna cauda (which is probably our new favorite find of the past several months).  -Tracey Dempsey (desert genius of assorted Kasperski spots) is there & has wonderful creations. She typically has a great offering from Cowboy Ciao as well.  -Chrysa Kaufman & Rancho Pinot are there showcasing McClendon produce. Whatever they have flat out rocks. I've had amazing sandwiches there every time, unbelievable bean & sausage soup & about 50 glasses of meyer lemonade (the kids help).  The other absolute must for us is the bread by the Phoenician folks. They have a chocolate cherry sourdough which is insane. Pairs wonderfully with red wine & coffee (so it's easy to do twice in a day). Their other breads are awesome too.  That's enough for me to already be a win. I absolutely love that the chefs of some of the great local independent spots were there chatting & interacting with the community. Makes me doubly want to patronize their restaurants. It seems as if the chefs are pairing up with local farms as well.  Other faves:   -The tamale folks from Downtown Market are there with their excellent product. Unfortunately, they don't focus much on food sales on the spot but more on frozen packets for home.  We love their tamales (especially their chicken/mole).  -There is a hot dog stand using Vienna Beef & doing Chicago style dogs with sport peppers, celery salt & all. Food is good but be prepared to wait.  -There is also an interesting looking huge BBQ smoker which I need to try. Heard it was great from some folks we talked to.  -Maya's Farm is there. Produce looked great.  -There was an interesting vegan desert stall which was quite yummy that we'll be checking out more closely as well (dairy/egg allergic kids).  -Several artisan bread stalls...  And throughout the day, they also have live music which gives it a nice vibe.  Was bummed Tortillas Rosario isn't there any longer. Hopefully they'll return as they were there early on.   Excited that Seacat Gardens will also be coming back soon!  Have also heard Sweet Republic will have a presence soon which we'll be totall psyched for.  Fresh eggs are scarce. We've been too late but have heard that Maya & the goat lady have eggs. Definitely something that they need more of.  They also do the write your order down on a card & go pay at a central location type thing like Downtown Phoenix Market as well but there are a couple vendors who only take cash.  If you need it, there is an ATM just north of 1st street on Brown (west side of the street) - I needed it.  Anyway, for us, it's by far our favorite farmers market in town!

Just some more OTFM tidbits as going there is one of the highlights of our week.  As mentioned still coming in the original review, Sweet Republic and Seacat Gardens are now at OTFM.  Sweet Republic has been there for a few weeks and comes with their super cool orange & white bus (NW corner). They've got a selection of 7 or 8 ice creams & sorbets, their homemade granola, cookies, coffee, tea and other drinks. So psyched they're there!  As of this week, Seacat Gardens is now back to stay at OTFM. James Porter of Tapino will be hanging out with Carl (Seacat) and using his ingredients in a dish or two. The word is that Seacat's awesome heirloom tomatoes will be there in 2 or 3 weeks (5 or 6 varieties). He's growing 14 varieties of heirloom tomatoes. And I'm sure we'll see other interesting, gorgeous produce to come. Glad to see the "Gucci Gardner" at OTFM as some call him.  There are also a few egg vendors now. You still have to get there reasonably early but the Butter lady has a selection of eggs of different sizes. Super tasty. The goat lady usually has eggs early too.  As far as new finds, in addition to the killer lemonade by Rancho Pinot, they had an amazing pink grapefruit mint cooler. I don't even like grapefruit and I was jumping the wall to get some of our neighbors' grapefruits today to try to mimic (with permission of course).   Also like the tasty chorizo burrito by Gil's of Taos. Tried a couple other of the burritos & the chorizo is definitely our favorite.  As far as the other faves, of course we frequent McClendon Farms (amazing produce), Phoenician Bread (about 4 weekly must  have varieties), Digestif (for Payton Curry's hand pulled mozzarella & awesome frittatas) and Rancho Pinot (juices & killer sandwiches/soups) without fail.  Will be so sad if the market does close for the summer. At present, we've heard they may try to keep the market open year around & employ some shading although it will be sad to see McClendon absent for the few months he stops selling.

Another OTFM update...  Today the market took another step.  Went from the existing box formation to 3 rows. Looked a little cramped but it appears they'll be able to support a lot more vendors.  Heard amazing news as well.  Heard that in the summer, OTFM is going to move from it's current spot to directly below in the underground parking garage. Love this idea. One of the bummers of being a farmer's market lover in the Phoenix metro area is that it gets brutal in the summer months. Downtown Market at least has the fans, evap coolers & shading. Helps a bit but going underground in the summer months should make OTFM quite comfortable. Heard talk of fans, misters, etc. also being brought into the equation.   Totally psyched about it.    Do have a couple other recent finds to share as well. The lemon custard/Bubble Up float from Sweet Republic is amazing. Perfect as the days are getting hot. Today we got lucky & someone didn't pick up their special order from Phoenician Bread. We scored some cottage cheese/dill bread rolls which had been brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with sea salt. Chef Ben is awesome. Also officially addicted to Digestif's frittatas. They've become a weekly staple.  Today's pancetta/gorgonzola was super yum. The garnishes also stand way out.

I'm a huge fan of  Gangplank.   Prior to getting more involved with the community, I was happy to keep my head down & just work. Gangplank & many of the events they support there have totally opened me up to what a great tech community we have in Phoenix.   Since attending my first local event, Startup Weekend which was hosted there, I have been compelled to connect with folks in town & to try to do my part to make Phoenix a better place.  I'm also very impressed with how much they give and how little they ask. They provide co-working space for free, lunch & learns, social/work events like hacknight and also host many of the clubs & organizations in town. They really ask nothing in return. It's amazing.  I was very disappointed to hear of the break in there this weekend. Whoever did that is an absolute tool and if they are going to continue  lame, illegal behavior like that (until they hopefully get caught & prosecuted to the fullest), they need to confine it to targets that aren't as altruistic and giving as Gangplank.  If you wanted those computers, you likely know what Gangplank does for the communtiy & you deserve to burn.

Been meaning to try Cornish Pasty Company for I don't even know how long. Just hadn't gotten to it.  Today we got to the Mesa location and it was killer. Started off great just walking through the door. The decor is killer. They have done some neat things with the bar (tiling, industrial purse hooks - the Mrs. loves those so they stood out to me). The church pews for seating and the glassed over doors for tables are super cool. The melted candle bottles on the table and the black & white photos also help to give it a nice vibe.  Next looked at the menu and they have a great beer selection (mix of on tap & bottles). I did get a bit overwhelmed with the number of pasty choices (which is good). They also have quite a large number of vegetarian pasties which is nice - for the rest of the family. : )  Whittled it down to the chicken tikka, shepherd's pie and royale with cheese. The server recommended the chicken tikka and I went with that. The pasty itself was excellent. Great flavor, little bit of heat, great pastry. As the Mrs. is from Australia, we're big into pastry and things like pasties, meat pies, sausage rolls, etc. I definitely need to get her here soon!  The service was great as well. Everybody was super nice and quite efficient. Food and drink came quickly.   All in all, a great experience. Quite happy with the entire meal.  With so many pasty choices, I think it's trouble once you break the seal. I foresee many, many visits in our future.

We stopped by Singh Farms this morning for what I believe was their first public Farmer's Market (just their own product).   They are open on Saturdays from 8 - 12 and are just east of the 101 (east) off Thomas Road. If you head east on Thomas, it will be the first driveway on your left. When you drive in, there are 2 ways to go. You can head left and park in the open space which is very near the log cabin that serves as the location for their little market. You can also head right and drive to the back of the property where they sell their compost. They've been there for 7 years and have been supplying restaurants around the valley (Royal Palms mentioned) in addition to selling compost. I understand they've been selling compost on Saturdays for quite some time.  It is absolutely amazing to me that I was born and raised here, have lived here for the past 6+ years full time and I had no idea anything was in this location. If you pay attention now when you're on the 101 passing Thomas, you'll see there is this little grove of trees just east of the freeway.  The produce looks great and I've heard others really love it (haven't tried yet) but what really stood out to me was what a great spot they have developed there. As far as what they had for sale today, they had a small selection of great looking produce, herbs, honey, seeds, salts and other items.  Driving in, the property is covered with large trees. The atmosphere just seemed to be a bit different. Didn't feel like Arizona (the Phoenix metro area anyway). There was a ton of shade and the temperature seemed to drop a bit. In addition to having the farmer's market, they also invite you to tour the grounds. You could really tell a difference in the earth there - felt nice to walk on. Their compost is definitely getting put to good use.   Walking around, you see the different types of produce planted in gardens sprinkled throughout the property. They also have a lot of neat structures that give the place a ton of character. Their main building in front is an open log cabin. The setup of their little market is very cool.  In addition, roaming the grounds, I saw a cool fireplace built upon a giant block of tree trunk, a little old style outhouse-like storage shack, very cool timber tables and a hangout spot that resembles a cantina/bar.  They also have animals in different locations on the property such as chickens, peacocks, goats, dogs, wild mustangs, etc.  Mr. & Mrs. Singh & the rest of the folks there were super nice and helpful. The Mrs. also got a number of gardening tips from one of the folks there.  All in all, it's just got a great laid back vibe. It was a super fun place for us & the kids to visit. Almost felt like getting we'd gotten out of town though we'd maybe driven a mile or two.  Will be very interesting to see what develops there as more folks are exposed to them!

I'm a fan of Corleone's. I'm a big, big fan of cheesesteaks with wiz.  For me Corleone's, though a bit pricey, does the trick. Love the standard cheesesteak, typically go extra wiz. Good bread, ample meat, love the wiz. Can't beat the wiz. Great fries too. I'd eat it all time if the metabolism could afford it.  I know there's a holy war with regard to wiz vs. provolone but I saw an episode of Taste (by David Rosengarten) many years back where he supported the fact that wiz is a viable option for an authentic cheesesteak. Since that time, I have of course tried it (many times) and have been a fan since my first one. So you can rant & rave at me about provolone & authenticity but I'm sticking with my wiz.  While I'm always on the lookout for good cheesesteaks, Corleone's does the trick whenever I'm there.

We headed back to the One Eyed Dog for some fish & chips with friends the other day and were very disappointed.  It seems that the One Eyed Dog is no longer and now the location is Clancy's Pub. The temporary sign does have a shamrock logo (which we thought may have indicated it was now an Irish bar - nope) and also reads Pizza & Grill.  While the decor is still similar and many of the staff have been retained the big change that disappointed us was a completely new menu. Gone are the English specialties such as shepherd's pie, bangers & mash, bangers beans & chips, Scotch eggs, etc. They've even done away with their excellent fish and chips preparation. To be fair, we didn't try the new twist. One of the big draws for us last visit was an interesting English menu with great execution.  Now the menu is quite bland and the execution wasn't great either.  Our table had a BLT (not bad), a burger and a couple of wraps. Nothing stood out. Nothing super interesting. No raves for any of the food. The menu now consists of burgers, sandwiches, salads, wraps, pizza, etc. The one thing that comes to mind is that they have tater tots.   They've also eliminated some of the interesting beers (Boddington's, etc.) that were also a draw for us.  The staff were nice as before but we probably won't be back.  While some of it may be due to the change and the newness of the menu, I'd rather hit Zipp's next door whose execution of a similar menu is far better (in my opinion).  Might be great for some.  Just not our gig.

Really, really enjoyed Petite Maison last night.  First of all, I love the space. It's small, which I think adds charm. The patio is great and with weather like we've been having, it was amazing out there. I also love the restaurant interior itself. I love the space, the wood walls, the chandeliers, the bar... Very cool look and vibe.  We also had excellent service. Both the bartender and our server were great - total pros.   As far as our meal, we sampled a variety of things and really enjoyed most everything.  We ordered and shared the escargots, steak tartare, foie gras, Coquille Saint-Jacques (scallops), vichyssoise and onion soup. Highlights for me were the escargots, steak tartare, foie gras and onion soup.   The dishes were excellent. They even reminded me of the food my dad's old place (The Glass Door) served years ago, and not too far away. While we didn't have the puff pastry, the escargots with the pernod garlic butter were quite similar.  They were great. We definitely took full use of the good bread provided to soak up the garlic butter. The onion soup was also similar. It was fantastic, one of the best I've had in years. I will definitely be ordering that again. And while I may still be a bit partial to my dad's steak tartare, I'd also say that was excellent. I really liked the playfulness of the dish with the fried egg and homemade potato chips. The foie was great too.  We also had great drinks. They have a nice selection of spirits and the bartender made a very tasty chartreuse concoction that I didn't get the name of. I had a Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA that was served in a large very cold, snifter. Was a great way to present it and of course a great beer.  While they have a full menu, it's nice to see the option to go and get a variety of great appetizers. I also really like the idea of their late night staff meals.  It helps that it's just down the street too!

Ok, I'm pretty much cheese obsessed. I love it. Can't get enough of it. Doesn't mean I'm an expert though. With the limited resources in AZ, haven't gotten the education I need. If Murray's Cheese from New York was here, I'd be broke by now but I'd be a cheese expert.    So I'd been looking very forward to the opening of Petit Fromage. I would have been there opening day but the family returned from Oz that afternoon & it just wasn't possible.  We finally hit it today (a week late). In the interim, I'd heard mixed things.  I did hear that the selection wasn't that huge and it was pretty much 1 case of cheese.  So I went in with an open mind but not expecting Murray's (which is good). I left way, way more excited than I expected.  Speaking with Lara Hardwick, she DEFINITELY knows her cheese. It turns out she's been supplying some of the top restaurants in town for some time.  Found out we have eaten her cheese multiple times when we visited Binkley's (one of our favorites). From what I  understand she has been supplying them for some time along with other fine restaurants in town.  So walking into Delicious Dishes, we found the Petit Fromage section. It is one case. But after talking with Lara and sampling numerous cheeses, I was so not let down. I found that she specializes in artisan American cheeses. Cool. That is definitely not a population that I have targeted nor do I know much about it.   I tried a host of cheeses and found many remarkable. We ended up leaving with the 2 featured cheeses, Smoky blue cheese from Central Point, OR and Beemster XO, an aged Gouda from Beemster Holland. I already love blue and aged Gouda so I'm not surprised I would love them. I hadn't heard of either but thought they were fabulous and am so looking forward to cracking into them.   Another standout for me was Mahón (a cow's milk cheese from the island of Menorca, Spain with sharp, lemony, salty flavors). I also absolutely loved an intense blue cheese that I think was called Azul something or other.  I also quite enjoyed trying the unsalted and salted goat butters.  I'm already excited to return. I am confident that I will consistently find new and interesting cheese there and will learn a great deal from Lara.  If you are at all into cheese, you must get to Petit Fromage. Don't be let down at the first appearance of the single case (which is no bigger than something AJ's or Whole Foods might have). Engage Lara and put yourself into her hands. It is truly exciting to have someone here in town who knows and loves cheese, is quite ready to let you sample the case and that will help you learn and find just what you like.

I've been a fan of Zipp's for years. I appreciate it for what it is. Good pub food, cold beer and games on the tube. Not bad.  I've enjoyed most of the focaccias I've tried but typically get the chicken with an extra side of the garlic mayo. Burgers are good. Wings are good. Fries and onion rings are great. And love the cookie skillet.  So I was quite surprised yesterday when we found ourselves with some time to kill nearby and our Zipp's Arcadia experience was completely underwhelming.  Beer was still cold but the chicken focaccia was flavorless, as seemed even the garlic mayo??? And the fries and onion rings were limp lukewarm. It even seemed that the beer batter was way off with a chalky touch.   While I don't have high expectations for Zipp's, nothing crazy, I was still completely let down. Though I expect to spend a great deal of time this coming year right next door, I will take the extra time to choose and travel to a better nearby spot. I'm sure I'll give this location another chance in the future but not for a good while. Disappointed.

Hit up Modern Burger with Jason W. and Deb S. yesterday. I totally think this needs a separate designation from Modern Steak as it's quite different and for what it is, it's good...  It's basically a window in the side of Sam Fox's new place, Modern Steak. I think they do a couple of salads but I really didn't pay too much attention. We were there for the sliders.   They are....uh, basically....awesome! Two sliders of fresh ground beef, a house made bun (crazy foccacia looking one), American cheese, grilled onions, 1000 island & iceberg lettuce.  I'm hot & cold on Fox spots but I'm in love with Modern Burger's sliders. The beef was awesome. Super moist, juicy & flavorful. Cooked in butter??? The rest of the compliments were great. I was particularly impressed with the bun. First of all for some crazy reason, I'm strongly anti-foccacia. This bun looks like foccacia bread (cut square & about the same thickness) but it definitely wasn't. Soft & tasty, it was great sopping up the burger juices & dressing.  I also had the yukon gold fries which were good. While they don't jump to the top of my fry list, they're definitely respectable. MB has a few soft drink choices, a bunch of bottled water (sparkling & still) & I saw a bunch of bottles of wine so I'm guessing wines by the glass. (I was pretty much there for the sliders.)  The guys at the window were also quite cool & happy to do soda refills.  There were also some interesting looking ice cream sandwiches on the board.  While I thought everything was good, the major highlight for me was the sliders. I'd say they're even destination worthy. In addition to stopping over while in the mall, I will even fight the mall parking & crowds for more of those sliders.  It's in Fashion Square but is separate from the Modern Steak. Couldn't add the spot with the same address. Kept kicking it out.  Scottsdale Fashion Square 7014 E. Camelback Rd. Scottsdale AZ 85251 P: 480.423.7000

Hit Brad's Place for lunch when the other spot we were aiming for happened to be closed on Sundays.   Didn't have elevated expectations but the food ended up being quite good!  It's basically a neighborhood sports bar with a midwest flavor. Vikings, Packers, etc. on the walls.   The food took a while to come & trickled out 1 dish at a time. That might have been a function of lack of staff though as our server was all over the place - running food, behind the bar, in the kitchen. I was also probably least affected because mine came first. Was probably another 15 minutes + before the rest of our table was served.  So as far as my opinion on restaurants, it's mainly about the food. I can deal with service, delay issues if the food is good. Mine was.  I ended up getting the breaded pork sandwich. It was huge. Overlapped the bun by about 3-4 times. It was tasty and the fries were good too. And the rest of the table seemed to like their burgers, dogs & sandwiches.  Definitely wouldn't be averse to trying more of the menu if I ended up back this way.

So you live in South Scottsdale and you love coffee? For us that has meant drive time to Cartel, Lux, Liberty, etc. No more!  I'd been wanting to get to Sola Coffee Bar ever since I first heard about it but in a couple quick attempts when out with the family wasn't able to eyeball it's exact location. I'd heard they used Cartel Coffee Lab beans which is a plus for us and the fact that they were nearby?? How sweet would that be if it turned out well!  Well, I happened to meet up with someone today there and am so glad I did - turned out to be far overdue. First of all, it's a great looking place. Funky & cool but relaxed. They do have the free wifi - always a bonus. There is also ample parking around which kind of bucks the trend of great #phx coffee shops.  Then I did verify that they do in fact use beans from Cartel Coffee Lab. They also sell them. Bonus! Their confections also come daily from Lux. Another bonus. In addition to that, they have a changing selection of tea from Tea Gschwender down the block.  They have a nice espresso machine and my drink #1 there was excellent and complete with beautiful latte art. They were also brewing drip coffee in a manner quite similar to Cartel's so that bodes well. One thing they do that Cartel no longer does is brew up the decaf. That's much appreciated with Lee3 on the way.   I'm excited to get back, try more there and bring out the real coffee freaks in the family. I also heard from the folks there that Sola is non-profit.   One last point to remove the obstacle that delayed my first visit is that Sola Coffee Bar is located on 5th Ave a bit west of Scottsdale Rd. but still east of the Stetson connection. It is also on the north side of the road.

Decaf espresso in the house!!!   After multiple visits to Sola and a variety of drinks, it's safe to say that we're huge fans. And the great thing is that they're doing decaf espresso now too so the expecting moms now don't need to go without.  Big fan of the Haitian vanilla latte.

I'd say 4.5 stars. I'm definitely a fan but I don't have enough experience with Peruvian cuisine to know if it's as good as it gets. : )  I was first introduced to Peruvian food a week ago and have now been to Contigo Peru 3 times. From what I have come to learn, it is a natural fusion cuisine. There are large populations of different ethnic groups (some major ones being Chinese, Japanese and Italian) in Peru and those influences have all spilled over into the food of Peru. From what I understand, the cuisine of Peru is quite varied and the food served at Contigo Peru is primarily that of Lima.  The restaurant itself is great. It's clean and casual and the staff is amazingly nice. They were super helpful on every visit. I can't say enough about them.   Over the course of our visits, we had:  Lomo Saltado - tender loin beef strips stir fried with onions, tomatoes & french fries served with rice.   I understand this is a classic dish. I completely loved it. The stir fry is Chinese influence with tastes of soy sauce. It seemed like total comfort food, even bringing back memories of "chips & gravy" for the Oz folk and maybe even brings poutine to mind? It's kind of a carb fest but it's great. Easily accessible and super tasty. Not spicy at all. The kids loved it too. If you're new to Peruvian food, definitely a good place to start.  Saltado Contigo Peru - basically the same as loom saltado with shrimp. Also great.  Yuca con frita huancaina - slices of deep fried yucca root with a cheese and aji sauce.  First of all, aji here refers to peppers. This term is used all over the place. We enjoyed this but I don't know that we get the huancaina sauce yet. We ended up eating the yucca with aji (in this case referring to the spicy sauces/salsas on the table - more on that later).   Ceviche de pescado / camarones - ceviche with fish and/or shrimp,  shaved onion, lettuce, yam, corn on the cob & dried corn kernels (called ganchas?).   I loved these dishes. Sour and tasty but the thing that stood out most to me was the amazing contrast of textures.   Causa - layers of mashed potatoes seasoned with lime juice & aji and a chicken salad layer in between.  Kind of a crazy dish. Surprising texture (soft all the way through) but I really liked it. I liked the hint of spice and the taste of lime with the potatoes.  Chaufa Contigo Peru - beef, chicken and shrimp fried rice.  Enjoyed this well though I didn't really see a great deviation from typical Chinese fried rice.  Pescado a lo Macho - fish fillet fried and covered with a spicy seafood sauce containing shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels. Also some fried yucca slices.  This is a great dish. Super tasty with a bit of spice. One of the Heather's favorites.  Aji de Gallina - creamy yellow, spicy sauce, made with shredded chicken, ají amarillo (yellow chilis), cheese, milk, bread, and walnuts served with rice.  This was another great dish. It's actually not on the menu but I think they have it most Friday, Saturday, Sundays. Heather called it pure comfort food. Loved it, especially the subtle hint of spice. Think this will be a staple order.   Anticuchos - skewers of beef heart marinated in Peruvian spices and grilled. Also comes with it's own spiciy sauce.  This is another special dish. It's not on the menu and only there on occasion. Since they had it, I had to try it and definitely enjoyed it. Not spicy without the sauce. The kids also liked it quite well.  Rotisserie chicken - killer rotisserie chicken.  I loved this especially with the aji (spicy sauces) on the table. There were two of these, red & green, with the red being a bit spicier and the green having more of a cilantro flavor. I became a huge fan of these immediately. The first visit, I was using pieces of bread as a vehicle for the sauce. For the 2nd & 3rd visits, we ordered the chicken which just went perfectly with the aji. We also used it quite liberally in many other ways (on the yucca, over the chaufa, etc.).  If there were a good Peruvian restaurant close to the house, the rotisserie chicken and aji would be a definite staple. Felt healthyish and so tasty.  Chica Morada - Peruvian purple corn drink made with pineapple rind, cinnamon, and clove and then mixed with sugar and lemon.  I had this every visit and will probably always do. I actually liked a bit diluted. Light and clean. You can also order it by the pitcher which seems the best deal if you have at least a couple people drinking it.  All in all, I'd say we didn't have a bad dish. Looking at the menu, it can seem like french fry overload but with a bit of consideration, it definitely doesn't have to be that.  I'm a big fan and will be back often.

I'm not a fair judge of Republic Ramen.   I have had amazing ramen too many times now and when I go to a shop specializing in ramen, if it's not pretty great, then I can't help but hate it. They have "tonkotsu ramen" on the menu too so that alone sets expectations.  I ordered the "tonkotsu ramen" and hated it. Broth was weak with no depth of flavor. Noodles had no chew. As much as I hoped to love it, I was completely let down.  To be fair, I don't believe there is any decent tonkotsu ramen in Arizona.   I just don't see why this shouldn't be a concept that can be executed adequately here. For me, with the ramen I've had and love, it definitely wasn't.  Again, I'm not a fair judge of ramen. I'm mean and nasty about it. It's like sushi or uni. Once you elevate your expectations by having the stellar stuff, the mediocre doesn't cut it anymore.   And where I can eat American style sushi when I adjust my expectations (happy for crunch rolls and California rolls), can't do it for ramen.  If you're not passionate about ramen though, it's fine to ignore me. If you don't have amazing authentic ramen to hold it up to, it's probably fine.

I'm already a huge fan of Nobuo so I'm psyched to for any chance I get to try his food. Super bonus when it's very affordable.  Missed the 1st incarnation of this as I was out of town but happily made the 2nd.  Love the fact that it ran from sundown to midnight.  Big fan of anything that goes late. Actually went quite a bit past midnight.  Went with several friends which enabled us to try a good portion of the menu:  Started with McClendon's Select shishito peppers roasted in olive oil & soy sauce. Super yummy. About 1 in 5 were spicy. Perfect with beer.  Next up was watermelon & goat cheese with McClendon's Select sun-gold tomato, olive oil & mint. Another great dish. Light & refreshing. Great for the AZ night.   A universal favorite is always the soft shell crab sandwich with green papaya slaw. These are always killer. Got hooked on these at Sea Saw a long time ago and they are one thing I can never get enough of.  Had the pork belly with steamed buns & pickled mustard greens. This was a killer sandwich. Loved it.   Also had the marinated short rib with steamed buns. Also good but would probably do 2 pork belly next time.   Anddid my first ever Okonomiyaki - Japanese pancake with pork, octopus, squid topped with pickled ginger, shaved bonito, dried shrimp, Japanese mayo & tonkatsu sauce. I'd been wanting to try this for a long time. It was super yummy. Quite rich too. I batted cleanup for a couple people with these.  I also did one of the Japanese sodas which are always fun. They're the one in the cool shaped bottle with the marble used as a seal that you have to break through. Kind of like an interesting candy flavored Sprite, less sweet though. Yummy.  And then I finished up with the Kakigori (Japanese shaved ice). I went with strawberry, sweetened condensed milk and red bean. Just flat out awesome.  Ready for Nobuo's next gig!

I've had a number of meals here and never been disappointed. It's definitely one of our go to places.  They do a nice breakfast burrito and a great burger. Fries are also quite nice.  While we often do take out (with it being right next to Gangplank), I also like the ambiance of the cafe. It's got kind of a cool, old style feel.  Staff is super nice as well.

I'm a fan of The Herb Box. I realize I'd been there once before and really enjoyed it then as well.  Today the family came by to meet for lunch and I happened to have an email in my inbox with the new lunch menu at Shea. Talk about good timing. I'm trying to be a bit better at eating healthy and looking at the menu, there seemed to be a number of selections that would let me do that & still enjoy the food.  From looking at the menu, it was nice to see that they buy local where possible and are part of the Slow Food movement.  We started with the housemade sweet potato chips with sea salt and curry. These are ridiculously addictive. My 2  year old kept telling us "don't eat them all" and putting her hand over the basket. We all couldn't stop. While they might not really be, they even seemed healthy-ish (for chips anyway). I'd love to see if they had an extra curry version.  For lunch, we ordered the market sunflower salad (with chicken, bacon, goat cheese, dried berries, sunflower seeds & balsamic vinaigrette), the blackened chicken caesar salad (with crisp romaine, cotija cheese, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan caesar dressing), and the kids split the brown sugar pork sandwich (with watercress-jicama slaw).  As our little ones have dairy and egg allergies, they were great about working around that and giving us suggestions. They were super nice with the kids too.  The food was excellent all the way around. I'm not by nature a big salad guy but I went that way as I'm trying to lay off the carbs a bit. I really liked both and will be eager to order either of them again.   I'm also eager to try some of the more carb-y items on the menu when I can. They had a couple of soups that sounded wonderful.   The service was great. Our server was quite knowledgeable, super personable and very engaging. He also put up with our 2 girls flirting with him non-stop.  As far as drinks, we did green tea and blackberry jasimine tea. Both were quite nice.  As I'm committed to staying on this healthy train, I think there will be many, many more visits to The Herb Box in my future. At present, I'm hard pressed to think a better healthy/tasty lunch option.

Went back again today & everything was spot on.  Of the specialties, had the beef buns, the pot stickers & the beef pies. Added the cold, spicy noodles with cucumber & the cumin lamb.  Everything was fantastic.   The dumplings & pies were hot and the super tasty. I love what they do with the fillings. Great flavors. But they are really amazing with the dough parts. The bun of the beef bun itself was fantastic. Chewy, crispy, perfect. The dumpling wrapper of the pot stickers was also wonderful. I know they do XLB at times & I need to try that. I've heard it's gotten better from when they first started. If it's not fantastic yet, I have hope that they'll get there.  Everything just seemed so much more dialed in than my last visit. That was a good while ago.  I definitely won't be waiting as long until I return!

We're big fans of Rocket Rooter and Roger.   We saw Rocket Rooter get recommended on Yelp and even though we live quite a way away called them to see if they'd help us. They do service our area & have been out out to help us multiple times.  We had another emergency today and they were able to make it out and take care of everything very quickly.  It's very cool to have a great plumber that you know and can depend on. With some of the other service big shops, it's luck of the draw and the quality of service is totally dependent on who shows up.  Roger is a great guy and if you are looking for someone reliable that you can get to know and depend on, he's your man. His rates are also very affordable.  Have nothing but great things to say about Rocket Rooter and recommend them without reservation!

So we got there tonight and it happened to be opening night. Had a bunch of friends who also attended separately and....  It was great!  It's not fancy (which I couldn't care less about) but the people were as nice and friendly as could be and the food was stellar.  Having a father from Canton, China, I grew up eating Cantonese food all my life and only recently have been trying other regional Chinese cuisine - thanks to some good friends.  From what I understand, they have imported a Cantonese chef and a Sichuan chef from China. Not positive but the food tastes like it could be the case.  We went with the kids & had 5 dishes. All were fantastic.  Salt & pepper calamari - delicious.  Light & flavorful. The kids devoured these.  Scallion pancakes - absolutely loved. Simple but super tasty.  Will be a staple on subsequent trips.  Water boiled fish - this dish was phenomenal. I'm still pretty new to the properties of Sichuan peppercorns but I love them. Fish was excellent with some kind of bean sprout some celery in a spicy sauce. If you're not familiar with Sichuan peppercorns, the start slow & then the heat builds & builds. The really cool thing is that they also have a numbing quality. Same thing. Starts slow & builds & builds. I love it. My friend mentioned to me how you get to a point where when you drink water, it almost seems carbonated from the numbness. Couldn't have loved this dish more.  Yu Xian eggplant - this might have been my favorite of the night. I'm not a huge, huge eggplant fan all the time as it's just too soft of texture for me at times. This was still quite soft but the sauce just made it amazing. It's hot, sour, salty & sweet at the same time. Probably my favorite eggplant preparation ever. Think there was also some minced pork in there. Great, great dish.  And then we finished with..  Lai Tangyuan (glutinous rice balls served in soup) - these were lovely as well. They had a delicate, thin skin & were stuffed with a sweet sesame paste and were served in a sweet clear soup. Great way to end the meal.  Super reasonable as well.   For me, a great, great new spot for us. Super nice people, fantastic food, great value!  Going back tomorrow night with the whole extended family. Woot!
