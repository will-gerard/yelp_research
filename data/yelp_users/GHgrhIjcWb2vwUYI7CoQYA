drinks are super cheap!! The grilled cheese I ordered is my new favorite thing!!  service was fast and friendly and this place is just in an awesome location the vibe and atmosphere are great, they always have some kool new theme going on which makes it almost like a different experience every time I go. I came here with my boyfriend for a nice dinner and they were having a "blackout night" so all the lights were off except some ambient lights and candles on the tables so you had to read  your menu with a flashlight they provided, needless to say it was pretty kool and fun!! I love this place! I highly recommend!!!

People are right about this place being very clean and the staff being super nice!! Everyone from the cashier to the cook made sure we were satisfied and wanted us to know how they made their food to order! The burgers were very delicious and their burger sauce was very yummy!! I will be back for sure because I liked the food but most importantly because my fianc√© and I received excellent customer service...some people forget how far that goes nowadays! Thank you for being so friendly! You've earned our 5 stars!!

Looking for a place to eat on a Friday night and we stumbled across this place! , I wasn't in the mood for Thai food but once we ordered our appetizers and entrees I pleasantly pleased! The taste of the short ribs was delicious and our tiger prawns were very tasty!! I would recommend this place for a relaxed date night

This place is great!! I have been looking for a fun and affordable Zumba class in the Tempe area and I have finally found it!! Thanks to my new  MindBODYconnect APP I was able to find this awesome place! To my surprise it was less than 10 min from my house and centrally located to everything. I particularly loved the environment and the energy of this place, everyone was super friendly and nice which definitely makes me want to go back!! Thanks for the awesome workout!!!   If youre into the huge fitness classes with a tons of people and no room then this is not the place for you.
