Horrible customer service. Called to ask for a quote and when I came into the store, it was triple the price. Then told me - with an attitude - they couldn't honor my quote. Purposely talking over me, didn't even want to deal with the situation, extremely rude.

Have loved living here for the past 3 years. Ciera and the front office staff are incredible and always super friendly. It's pretty quiet and a great location. Maintenance staff quick and helpful. Awesome place to live.

I agree with all of the people above... this is the place where I got all of my training as a Kundalini Yoga teacher. Some of the best Kundalini Yoga teachers in the whole country teach here. They are people who radiate loving kindness, great energy to uplift others. The community around the area is also amazing. Some of the most magical moments of my life were spent in this building. This place has changed my life. Definitely worth a try.

I unfortunately had a terrible experience at Butters today. After calling ahead of time and receiving confirmation that dogs were allowed in the patio, I brought my small dog there for breakfast. I waited for 30 minutes for a table, only to be told by the hostess seating us that dogs were only allowed by the fence, information that I never received when I had called earlier. There were no other tables available. Then I asked to speak with the manager, since we didn't want to waste the trip and wanted to understand the situation. The manager was very defensive and unfriendly from the beginning of the conversation, and said that only service animals were allowed in the patio, also information that I did not receive over the phone when I first called. Also, there was another dog on the patio at the time that was clearly not a service animal. What happened today was very unfortunate. The food is decent, but service was clearly lacking.

Ann was SO SWEET and helpful, amazing customer service. I came to her to get a trial spray tan for my wedding, and she explained the whole process with detail and did a fantastic job. I don't usually get spray tans and was afraid it would look unnatural on my wedding photos, but it was the opposite. The color was very natural and made my white dress pop even more! The tan helped me look slimmer, too. Also, on the day of our tan, my husband forgot his shirt and she kindly gave us one. So thoughtful.

I love Chipotle, but America's Taco Shop is better and cheaper. Flavorful Mexican, without all the grease, tastes clean and healthy.

You have to try Nori's happy hour menu. Pretty amazing they charge so little for such high grade fish and high quality prep. Love this place!
