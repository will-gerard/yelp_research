I give it two stars only because the food service was excellent by our server Ryan D (46).  The rest is a hot mess. How is this place still open?    You enter and head to the "ticket" area or at least you think you are because as a customer you have no idea how to start playing games?  We get to the middle of the place to a long line and look above and decide to order the family four pack special as it's Sunday.  $40 for a large pizza and four one hour passes.  Well needless to say after 7minutes in line we are told that we have to go upstairs and order that from our server?  What?  Seriously.  Could there not be a sign?  Could one not pay for the $40 and go pick up a pizza upstairs with a ticket?  One can always order drinks and appetizers with the server if they are worried about not getting their servers work??    Anyway then we hear a technical speech regarding the cards because you can't play games that dispense tickets.....seriously?  Which games are those?  Are they tagged?  In a certain area?  Are you kidding me?  The "host" notices the discontent and he looks spazzed out!  Do you work here dude or are you a disney animatronic?  How about up-sell and offer to sell me another card that works on the ticket games.... Not that I would really want to but bringing in a couple of 8 year olds ....they kind of like those tickets?!!!    Still confused about the way crap works in here and to no avail we buy a regular pass from the animatronic and my Husband goes off to let the kids play while i go order food.   Nope. They don't give you your passes until you close out ( are you freaking kidding me) or at least I am too agitated to ask our sweet server because so far my attitude of this place has gone downhill fast. Wondering why we didn't just go to Dave and busters?    So upstairs... All the old games are gone that once used to be on the wall, (the racing games and the old school games) and downstairs my husband is running into games that are out of order or don't take the card!!  Lol  No good place of business should be this darn complicated. It's ridiculous. Who are the people running this establishment?  Honestly... Even my 8 year old said , they should have videos up of people playing video games ( would help since they don't have any of the major ones) and this place could be cooler.   Don't know but won't be a bit surprised when this place closes for good.   Won't come here again. Save your money. Stick to Dave and busters at Tempe marketplace or order Gametruck to come to your house for a video game party experience.    Grrrrrrrrr

Overpriced. Grass fed hamburger or not... If I'm paying for an overpriced 12 dollar burger why the heck does it not come standard with fries.  Oh wait. That is $10 for an entire stash.

Seriously on the lines?!!!  It's ridiculous. What happened to ten items or less?  Even the self checkout is ten people deep!  Hire people or get every staff member to a register.  Darn I miss fresh and easy!  Just needed two things and I spend more time in line than the store itself.

Hmmmm.  I guess it will matter if the store was actually open when I got here.  Note on door says they were closed due to odor next door (it's a storefront under construction). Not sure which odor would cause a store to close but seriously?  Open the windows?  Why would one lose business but maybe they don't get that much to justify being in the stink.  Lol.   Hopefully they are open tomorrow so I can update the review with favorable ratings.
