Great service, great selection! My husband and I both got bikes here, we could've got them somewhere else, but the people here were so nice, that we came back and had them order the bikes for us. Plus they gave us a discount since we bought two bikes. They built my bike in just a couple hours for me, and I LOVE IT! So glad we found this place on yelp!

I'm giving them a 5 just for their spaghetti and meatball calzone. It sounds awful, but it is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Must try!!

My friend and I have literally spent the last week at this place studying for a national exam we have coming up. We've eaten 2-3 meals here per day for the last five days and honestly everything I've had has been so good. And the prices are great! What I love the most are the people who work there. They are so friendly. Everyone coming to our table and promptly removing plates, the manager just asking if we're doing ok, and making sure the Internet is working right. I mean really a nice place so spend a morning, evening, and like us... Entire days!! :)

Dr. Steinhauer is the greatest!! It is quite clear that she loves animals and loves her job. I took my cat to her when she was on the edge of dying and Dr. Steinhauer and the staff truly cared and worked so hard to get her healthy again. I can say that my beautiful Phoebe is healthy and happy today because of the doctor. I now take my sweet new puppy there and see the doctors at banfield. I've seen Dr. Steinhauer and Dr. Horner and had very great experiences. (Dr.masscotte is pretty rude so we no longer will see her) but other than her, the staff at banfield is great! They call the day after our appointments to see how the animal is doing. Its really nice, too, because they give you a printout of services they suggest for your pet with prices so you can choose what you want and what You can afford. Seriously, your pet will love it here!!

If I were only grading the donuts --- I think 10 stars would be in order. However, everything else on the menu that I've had is horrible. I order a hot cocoa once, DISGUSTING. Also, the lady that works there and takes the order is so rude!! BUT, the donuts are fabulous, so go here for donuts, just be prepared for horrible service, and don't order anything else off the menu.

Food is great, service is great!! What more could you ask for....well maybe less of a wait would be nice. But let's be honest, the reason you wait is because everyone loves it!! My favorite menu items are the BC Sandwich and the Bird omelette and my husband swears by the Eggs Benedict. This is our favorite place for Sunday brunch!!

Still fantastic!!! Have tried many breakfast places in the area, and this one still wins. We come here most weekends. My husband always gets the eggs Benedict, and he loves it! I either get the Bird omelet, or the BC Sandwich, both delicious. If I could make one suggestion, maybe the management will read this ;), please start offering Individual French press coffee, would make this a 6 star place!! See you next Saturday BClub!

The food here is very good. I ordered the monkey cakes and figured there would be bananas and almonds on top of pancakes. To my surprise the bananas and almonds were actually baked into the pancakes. The same for the fruit cakes my husband got. Super cute place and nice atmosphere. However, the service wasn't great, but the food made up for it. The other waiters seemed to be good, but our specific one just kind of sucked.

Great salon in Old Town. I found this place on yelp and decided to try it out. I called and got an appointment with Lisa. She was so great! She did a whole color consult with me before and showed me color samples and everything. My hair turned out exactly how I wanted it. I'm all about looking like natural blonde.... And I totally do! I was super impressed with the way she did the color.

First, I walk in and say "I have an appointment." The guy says "I don't know what that means." Really? Then this other guy comes out takes my keys and says it will be 45 minutes for the four wheel alignment. Fine. So I go across the street for a lunch. 50 minutes pass so I walk back to the car place. The guy sees me coming, quickly moves another car off the.ramp and then moves mine up to work on it. I ask him, "Seriously!! You haven't started it yet??!!?" He says the other car was here first and its been here all day on the ramp. Except when I dropped off my car the ramp was empty. So fifteen minutes after I came back the car is done. Then I had to take it somewhere else to have the alignment checked again because I didn't trust the guy. Basically this place was more hassle then its worth and the guy was a liar which just isn't a good thing for a mechanic. I will say, that I ended up getting a call later from the manager, and he said he would look into it. Hopefully they're getting their act together, and they fired that guy. If you do go here, just make sure you keep good tract of what's going on.

This place is great. Now I would like to qualify my 5 stars. These strip mall nail salons usually suck so bad that 1 star is too many. That being said, as a strip mall nail salon goes, this place is top-notch. But don't go expecting some amazing 5 star spa, you won't get it. What you will get is a clean, sanitized, friendly staff. The guy did my pedicure and it was one of the best I've ever had. My feet & calves were so sore from ballet and now - they feel great! I got gels done, and I will say they aren't really set up to do gel toes. (they are for hands). I wish they had the UV light a little more convenient for feet, I had to get up each time, but otherwise a very pleasant experience for a very stressed woman!

So good!! Seriously, I mean it. This place is fabulous. You will walk in and think, "What the hell is this place?" Then you will eat your lunch and then start planning your next meal here. Super delicious.

Great pizza, we got there early because we were told how long the wait can be. To our surprise, we got as eat at the bar the second we walked in. I think this pizza is very good, but..... There is one place that is better (see my other reviews). The pizza here is definitely special' band the atmosphere is great. I think you should come here at least once while in Phoenix.

I feel like I've traveled the United States eating pizza.... Washington, Phoenix, New York City, Vegas.... and I constantly find myself comparing everyone else's pizza to LGO's. I have not found a pizza better than the Roasted Corn pizza. It is just fantastic! This is my FAVORITE PIZZA in all the land!! :) The Gladiator isn't half bad either, very delicious. You win LGO!

Seriously, some of the best food I've ever had! Super great. The shrimp appetizer was to die for, I mean it. I ended up having the special of the night, which was lamp chops. OMG! I was so full, but couldn't stop eating it. I practically licked my plate! The prices are expensive, but so totally worth it, especially for a special occasion. I almost forgot...  the bread they give you as a starter thing, excuse my french... HOLY S*$T. I cannot explain to you how great this bread is. I mean seriously, we ended up being the white trash people who asked for one more dinner roll, because it was like 'last meal of your life' type good. (and gluten free for those with celiac - so everyone can try this little bit of heaven)!! Go here on an empty stomach and ENJOY!

Great Atmosphere!! We always go sit on the patio for drinks. Very nice :) I think the food here is good, but it's overpriced, in my opinion (which of course this review is ;) ). We come here often just for the atmosphere and sangria. Pitcher of sangria is $20, which I think is a good deal here.

I like most of the food here. We've been 3 or 4 times. I love the guacomole, but I will say some of my favorite mexican food options aren't on the menu. Prices are kinda high and service is hit or miss. I've definitely had better Mexican food, but we've obviously been back more than once.... so overall, good food.

This place rocks! My pups, Martin, had so much fun here. As soon as we got to the car he was OUT! The water is great for them, I imagine that those dogs who got sick here weren't fully immunized. You should check with your vet before taking your dog to any dog park. But, seriously, this place is great, if you dog even kinda likes water, he will love this park.

Very interesting little place. Very authentic southern food. I had the fried chicken with Mac and cheese and fried ocre. All very good, I'm giving four stars because I felt like the menu was a little small, like I wanted more choices on food. But overall, good for some fried chicken and waffles! Good service, too!

I will not choose to go back to this place. I had a martini, it was ok, other people had the suishi, again they said it was 'ok.' Mostly the customer service here is AWFUL! Don't go in with a group, they force everyone at a table to be one 1 ticket. THEY WILL NOT SPLIT A TICKET! WILL NOT! I even talked to a manager and they refused to do this. I felt like I was imposing on them for bringing them business. Don't go here. There are plenty of good suishi places around that will actually appreciate you business. Don't do it.

My husband and I have takeout from here far more often than I care to admit.... Chicken pad Thai!!! Yum! I'm not a big Thai connoisseur, so I cannot speak to the authenticity of this place, but I love every bite and eat takeout from here probably once a week. The lady who owns it is super nice and friendly. They are a small shop so don't come here if you're in a big rush. Overall I love La's and will continue coming here and enjoying the food!

BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD! Literally. Go and have the breakfast, Chicago Pizza. Yes, I know it sounds weird, but it is so good you will end up eating the entire pizza by yourself, even if you tell yourself you're only gonna eat half. It's not possible, its just too good. Price is pretty good, maybe slightly pricey for breakfast (i think the pizza is like $9 ish) but completely worth it. Outdoor seating available if its not too hot. But seriously, go here and eat.

Really, 3.5 stars?? What are these people smoking?! Maybe if you are an expert cyclist and know everything you'd ever need to know, maybe then this would be a decent place to go. But as a beginner, I went in hoping to purchase 2 bikes for my husband and I to start Mountain Biking. I asked the guy for help and to answer a couple questions. The guy never even stood up, he just sat behind the counter and said to me "you don't even know you'll like it, so I can't help you" He said I needed to figure out if I liked riding and what bike I wanted before coming back and then he'd help me. He was just a total jerk. So I left, went down the street to another bike shop and bought 2 great bikes! Their loss I guess, because we are loving our new bikes and new hobby and go every weekend.

We have come here multiple times, every time we are in Vegas. The wild boar pasta is phenomenal, and the sangria is great and very well priced. My husband and I LOVE this place! Great value and amazing food, especially for Vegas.

I've been coming here for several months now, and it's great! I've been wanting to get back into ballet for a long time, but never could find a studio for adults. The owner and other teachers are so good and make me not feel like an idiot. (it's been awhile since I took ballet). I have taken other classes there, too, including pilates and ballerobica --- both very good. I've been wanting to lose a little weight for awhile now, and I am officially down one jean size, and the only thing I've changed is working out here. This is a great studio, definitely try it out, I even think the first class is free!!

As my husband so eloquently put it, "This place is tremendously average" Granted, this should've gotten them 3 stars, but the service was AWFUL!!! It was during march madness, and not one of their TVs had a single game on....seriously?? So I asked - can you turn on a game, 35 minutes later, and after asking 3 seperate people, someone finally tried to change the channel. But guess what?? Apparently none of them no how to work a remote. So we never got to watch the game (which went into OT btw, would've been a GREAT game) The food wasn't bad, per say, but it was nothing to EVER go back for. I had pasta - sauce was way to tomatoey, they definetely need to learn to cook italian food if they're going to be an italian restuarant. My husband had the chicken - again not awful, but we won't be returning. If you're going for drinks - probably fine place to go, just don't order any food.

Eric was GREAT!  I recently moved here from Washington and have been trying to find a new stylist. I had my haircut from some idiot a few months ago, so I went to yelp and found Eric. I'm very happy with my haircut even a few days later. The color is AWESOME! The only downfall of the salon - is trying to find it. When you go get your hair done here, because you should, just remember its INSIDE the sachi salon. You go into another salon and then take an elevator downstairs to the green room. It's kinda weird, but worth it. You definitely won't regret getting your hair done here!!

This place is a true gem. I thought a place called jacks warehouse would be basically a hole in the wall with crappy furniture, but my husband and I were desperate for a new couch that didn't cost a fortune. So we found this place on yelp, and decided what the hell. The furniture here is great!!! I wanted everything, and actually could afford the majority of it. They had really great leather couches and furniture at amazing prices. One of the best things about this place was the salesman. I know.... Salesmen suck, usually they are so annoying and pushy but this guy just introduced himself and then went back to his desk. So nice to be left alone to look. And when we did have a question, he was super knowledgable and helpful. We ended up buying a great couch, that we've now had for about a month. It's great quality and we love it. I will say that I was a little ticked off because they screwed up our delivery date.... but, I forgive them because they made it up to us by up grading our delivery for free. So glad we found this place! We bought a great new couch and we will definitely be back!!

Fantastic food! I had the turkey and Brie sandwich, OMG seriously, so good. I just wanted more. The good news' the potato salad the sandwich came with, was equally fantastic. I left full and happy. I will be going back for this sandwich!! They lost a start because of service (one of the waitress' friends was at a table, and she kept just sitting and talking to her, meanwhile we had empty water glasses on a hot day), and also, prices are kinda high. Mostly a great experience here, we will be back.

Solid place for pedicures and manicures. It is definitely one of those places where very few of the ladies speak English, and you will not know what they are saying to each other... but, good value. Also, I've had gel manicures from multiple places and absolutely, without a doubt, these gels last longer than any other place I've gone to. Minimum of 2 weeks, and honestly, they would last way longer, but my nails grow out and look weird so I have to change them. But they don't crack at all. Try this place out!

So happy I found this place on yelp. I've been looking for a long time since I moved to Phoenix for a good color and cut.... and that doesn't cost me $200. This place fits all the check marks. I loved my color and the cut is great. I saw Nicole, she was super patient and really listened to what I wanted. She showed me how to style it and gave me lots of styling tips! I'm so sick of other places charging $50 for a haircut AND another $25 for blow drying.... I mean it's part of the cut. This place does not charge you extra for the damn dry :) Anyways, the ambiance of the salon is really nice and fun, the people are super friendly, and most importantly Nicole did a great job and I will be going back for sure!!

Love this place. Started going here in June, and still going strong. It's super easy to stay motivated, and it is truly a "no-think" complete workout. I'm super busy, so it's nice to just be able to show up and workout. I'm sure my husband and I will be members here for a LONG time!

Love this place! We come here a lot to watch a basketball game and get some drinks. The only down side is the food prices are kinda high for the food you get. The food is good, just not amazing. If you're looking for a fun place to drink and get some bar food, this will fit the bill.

Came here for the first time to give the pups a wash. The people were super friendly and helpful, especially with my giant furry dog. They didn't even complain about the massive amount of hair he left in the tub... Way better than it being in my bath tub, that's for sure. They also have lots of dog food options and a bag program...buy 10 get 1 free. The prices are very reasonable for the wash. $13 for a basic wash, $15 and they provide the shampoo and conditioner, and $18  for this specialty thing that mixes the water and the shampoo for you. We did the basic wash and brought our own shampoo and conditioner. But next time we will be doing the $18 one. With as big and fluffy my dog is, I think next time we will opt for the more convenient one. We will definitely be back several times a month. The connivence of washing the dog here is worth every penny!!

My husband and I were interested in starting Mountain Biking and were wondering what kind of bikes to go with and just had general questions. So first I went to Tempe Bicycle.....big mistake! The guy told me that I didn't know if I even liked it and I shouldn't buy and bike and to come back later when I knew what I wanted. I said ok, and headed over to Bicycle Exchange. The owner happily asked all my questions, told me what each type of bike had to offer and gave me a few exceptions. I went home did a bit of research on the different bikes he suggested. The next day I went back and bought myself and my husband a new bike, he gave us a great deal, too! We've been out several times now and multiple trails in the Valley, and we couldn't be happier!!! The bikes handle great and have been a really great investment. I totally recommend going here. The owner will answer any questions without making you feel like an idiot (unlike other tempe bike shops ;) ) I will definitely be back for an bike needs we have.

Yum yum yum! This place is in a super weird location, but oh my gosh, the sushi is fantastic. I'm not a huge sushi connoisseur, but I eat it from time to time, and the roll I had here was honestly the best sushi roll I've ever had. My husband LOVED his, too, he had the Las Vegas and Golden Philly roll and raved about both. The wait staff is also super nice and attentive. Make sure to go for happy hour, too - fantastic prices on rolls! Can't say anything bad about the place.

Sooooo happy!! My husband and I used to live right next door to their first location and when we moved, I missed going there so much! And then they did it! They opened a second location near my new place. I was so excited to go here for their first opening weekend. Sat on the patio with my dogs and had the amazing Chicago Brizza (breakfast pizza) which is one of my favorite things. I love the atmosphere of this place, and the food is always great! Prices are good. The weekend we were there, the food was kinda slow to come out, but it was opening weekend so I'm giving them a break. I'm sure it will get better. Honestly I am so glad to have my favorite breakfast place back.
