Great service and wonderful authentic Mexican food. I've been living in this neighborhood for years and just discovered this treasure today.

Tracy's was amazing! I'm never going to the insurance recommended shop ever again, just Tracy's. They worked with me to get the deductible out of pocket into my price range, and at the same time managed to get me a great price on clear coating the rest of the paint on my car. I got in an accident, and Tracy's managed to repair my car to a point where it looks better than the day I bought it. Thanks Chip and Aaron for working hard in getting my baby baby back to pristine condition!!

I saw Dr. Reynolds on a referral from my primary care physician. He was nice enough, but I didn't really feel like my concerns were addressed. He sent me to get an MRI, but I had to follow up personally to get my results, which I was given quite quickly over the phone from another doctor, and they never bothered to schedule a follow up visit to discuss the results. My medical dollars would have been better spent elsewhere. To get my MRI results sent to my PCP, I called and it turns out their records person only works Tues and Wednesday from 8 am to Noon. I am not at all pleased with the customer service at this office.
