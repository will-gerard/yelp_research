I feel so fortunate to live in a neighborhood with two great corner stores. Sunshine is right by my house and has proven to be a life saver so many times. Whether it's craft beer I am looking for (on sale for $3.99 a six-pack) or some random tool that I find out I'm missing in the middle of a home repair project they almost always have it. I'm pretty sure the owners think I'm a little strange for the amount of time I spend staring at their tool aisle....  The family that owns the place is great -- very kind and fun to do business with.   There aren't enough shops like this left in this country -- I feel better every time I walk through the door.

Loved this place! It's convenient to my home in Coronado, nicely priced and delicious. Definitely going back for the beer specials.

Tonight I called in a pizza as I have done a few times before, and went to pick it up promptly 25 minutes later. At checkout my beer, pizza and fresh homemade baklava (that was just sitting there asking me to buy it) came in at under $20...and they carried the pizza to my car for me.   I adore this place for its convenience and for the awesome people that staff it. The owner is super friendly and always remembers me -- and they have the best selection of beer and wine that I have seen in any convenience store anywhere.   Other neighborhoods should be jealous of Coronado just because of this store.

I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place. The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class.   I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.  The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before.   In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.   I am not planning a return anytime soon.

I can't say enough good things about this place. I've taken several pieces of clothing in over the years for hemming and other tailoring services and Dennis always does an excellent job at a great price.   Most recently, I had a suit custom made in San Francisco for my wedding. I was supposed to have it fit in May, however the fabrics were delayed and I was unable to make another trip to the Bay Area to get it taken care of later, so I had it shipped here and I took it in to Dennis for a fitting last weekend.   I just picked up the ensemble this afternoon and it fits perfectly! As a woman who likes to wear "men's" suits, it's always tough finding things that fit just right. For my wedding I was willing to spend the money to have something custom made and I am SO glad I did.   Dennis is the best -- he takes care of his customers and does excellent work -- what else could you ask for? He's also really fun to talk to. :)

This place is great! Once I was able to pull my jaw off the floor I found some great deals in the tools section, bought a lawn mower for $50 and learned how to search the Craigslist catalogue. Having just bought my first home, I will definitely be making this my second for the next few months.

This place is great - I've been going for several months (before and after current ownership).   The first time was an emergency involving an at-home clipper guard malfunction -- Anna did an amazing job fixing my - er - handiwork. Since then, I've been going in every couple of weeks to have her continue to fix up my undercut and it's looking pretty rad now.   I highly recommend Anna -- she does well with men and women and she did an especially good job just in advance of my engagement shoot.   The place has great atmosphere too -- comfortable seats, neat decor and a good environment to wait in.
