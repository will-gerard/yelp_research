I had an excellent ice cream soda and a great sandwich for lunch. The decor/seating was excellent. I felt like i went back in time just walking in. The food and staff were tops! Highly recommended!

I recently met with a client here for lunch on his suggestion. When I arrived I was surprised...the decor/seating area leaves something to be desired.   However, the FOOD was awesome! I had the Doughboy, which is their "most popular" sandwich and I know why. It was excellent and I highly recommend the restaurant.

I've had nothing but good experiences in this Verizon store. Contrary to the first review, it's never taken me very long to be helped when I've come to the store. I rarely go in to any verizon store, as most problems can be solved online or over the phone with verizon customer service.   I think the longest wait I've ever had in this, or any, Verizon store was 15 minutes. I've been treated well and had nothing but positive experiences with Verizon. I tend to research EVERYTHING i buy, so I usually don't have big issues with phones, but I feel confident the the reps at this store are more than capable of politely helping me when I need help.

Having lived in Hawaii for over 5 years, I constantly have a craving for Hawaiian food. Moki's reminds me of little local restaurants in Hawaii. When I walk in I feel like I'm back in the islands. The atmosphere is very local style and the people are totally laid back. The decor has a do-it-yourself feel that IS local kine.   I've tried every Hawaiian restaurant in the Valley and this is by far my favorite. I go back often and highly recommend Moki's to anyone looking for some great Hawaiian eats!

Casa Reynoso is definitely nothing fancy, but the food is good and consistently so! I've eaten there about a dozen times and each time has been great. The service isn't great, but it is more of a hole-in-the-wall so I don't expect much. The servers aren't overly cheesy and trying to win a tip. They simply take your order, and bring you good food, followed by the check. That's it. It's usually busy, but I've never had to wait to sit down. The complimentary chips and salsa are great too!

I always ask my Mexican friends for reccommendations on which Mexican restaurants to eat at. One of them told me this place is the best in the valley so I just had to try it. I've been back a dozen times, at least in the last 2 years. The food is always excellent, the service has always been exceptional and the price is right. I love the HUGE amount of chips they bring to snack on while waiting...it makes it so I don't ever have to order an appetizer.

A friend of mine has been telling me about Ted's for a while and I finally decided to go. The food was great! I had a "white hot" dog, some onion rings and their longberry juice drink. Everything was SO good, especially the rings. I give this 4/5 because I felt the prices were a little high for what it was. Knowing that I can hit up Costco and get a polish with a drink for 1.50 makes it hard to spend $9 on my meal. Other than price, it was excellent and worth the wait in the long line.

Dr. Layton has been our Ob/Gyn doctor since 2007. He's a great Doctor and all our experiences with him have been positive. He's polite, has great bedside manner, takes time with patients to answer questions and he's attentive to patients' needs. He has delivered 2 of our babies and will be delivering our 3rd later this year. We're glad we were referred to him.

I hate going to mechanics!! However, Bumper to Bumper was recommended to me by a friend and I've had only good experiences there. I took my car in for a basic repair that only cost me $25, but I expected to pay around $100 for it. I'm glad they were honest and didn't try to upsell me anything...they just fixed what was wrong and did it as inexpensively as possible. Highly recommended!

When I walk into the 19th Donut Hole I feel like I've gone back in time. I don't think that was ever their intention, they just haven't changed anything since the beginning. The decor, etc. it just plain and reminds me of...a donut shop!   I've been coming to the 19th Donut hole for 3 years now and I've highly enjoyed the atmosphere and donuts each and every time. The older lady who helps me has always been really polite and helpful, and really just reminds me of my grandma fixing me a snack. Highly Recommended!

I went to Hangar Cafe after a friend recommended it to me. I love little places like this...takes you back in time. I had breakfast and got a 3-egg sausage omelet with hashbrowns (with the onions!) and white toast. EXCELLENT food. The service was great, too! Highly recommended!

I eat at Mucho Gusto quite often with clients/potential clients. The lunch menu is very reasonably priced and has a great selection. I really like the chips and salsa delivered while you wait. I gave this a 4/5 because the wait is longer than normal once you put in your order. Other than that, it's great!

I love the gecko grill. We go there about once every couple of months and have always had a great time. We take the kids and it's great for them too. The location is a little small, but the food is great...especially the bean dip, which I always order more of. The servers have always been great, especially helping to accommodate our kids.

Excellent food, excellent service! We've been going to Rudy's for a couple of years now. It's the best Mexican food in the East valley. We absolutely love the chicken taquitos and the variety of burritos. It's family owned and operated and they treat us like family whenever we come in.

"At just brakes we really do care" is not the case at this location. I've had no other experience with this company except at this location. I found the mechanics and managers to be liars and thieves. $99 brake job turned into over $400...and they didn't stop there. Even after that initial $400+ brake job had problems, they tried to sell me a suspension replacement to "fix" the brake problem that they caused in the first place. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND this place. The back and forth with this company was horrible and the brakes still make noise.

One of my favorite places to grab breakfast in the East valley. The lunch is great too. However, those blueberry pancakes can't be beat! It's always busy and once you eat there, you'll know why. I love Joe's!

I grew up in La Verne, CA...home of In-n-out #3. I love in-n-out. However, i give this location a 4/5 because they hardly ever get my order down as I speak it. Most in-n-out locations are quick to understand my order...especially the originals out in CA. I love the food and the staff is great. I just wish they could get my order right without me having to repeat myself a couple of times.

We've been taking our kids here for a couple of years now. The Dr.'s, hygienists, assistants and staff are all SO GOOD with our kids. The prices are fair, especially since we don't have dental insurance. The waiting room makes kids relax, as it is all train-themed, with lots of toys and a huge train on one of the walls. We've had nothing but great experiences here!

My experience with all mechanics/brake shops/dealer service centers has always been that you go in for 1 thing and by the end of the day you've practically upgraded the whole car!   That is not the case with this Brake Masters. I went in for what I thought would be a simple fix and it was. I was pleased to get the phone call that everything looked great except the thing I came in for.   They fixed the brakes properly, quickly and didn't try to upsell me anything! It was a great experience and I will return in the future.

4 years ago I did something major to my back and had extreme back pain for about 6 months. I had tried all sorts of things to cure the problem, including physical therapy for about 4 months. I saw Dr. Pappoe for the first time in December of 2007 and he did some tests and educated me about the problem. He then suggested a solution and I followed his recommendations. My back was fine within a couple of months and I haven't had any problems since. Thanks, doc!

I just ate lunch here today and I have to say it was awesome! The place is small, but the food is delicious. Chris, one of the owners, chatted with me quite a bit about the restaurant and life in general. It was a great experience!

The words "world famous" grace the entrance of Rock Taco Cantina in Chandler...what they're famous for would be worth knowing.   A friend of mine met there for lunch a few days ago and were totally unimpressed. We were seated quickly, probably because there were so few people there. Drinks came pretty quick but were refilled only once after we sat with empty drinks for 5 minutes.   The food was okay...I've MADE better. It took forever for the waiter to bring us our food. I had a shrimp/steak taco and 2 carne asada street tacos. Flavor was okay, but the beef was dry. The shrimp were pretty plain, nothing special.   I really wanted to like this place. It looked pretty disorganized though, as we were at the bar and I could see communication (or lack of) between the cooks and what looked like management. The cooks look frustrated...pretty sure that frustration went right into my food.

Slow slow slow...kept forgetting things, forgot an entire meal for one person in our party. Every request we had took at least 5 minutes. Horrible experience.
