Nice hotel that's located not far from shopping centers and downtown Chandler.  Great staff, check-in was quick and easy.  Rooms are fairly big and clean.  Some can use a facelift but they are still in a very good shape.  The pool here is amazing, it has a bridge waterfall and its huge. Worth a visit just based on that.  Check out my pics and stop for a visit, if you are visiting during the summer this is the spot that's affordable and the most rewarding.

The breakfast was ok and also the service.  Nothing that can justify the $42 bill we got for a simple breakfast for two!! Nothing fancy just eggs and hash browns and orange juice and the breakfast plate ...  The place is nice but totally not worth it.

It's closed.  Only the pumps work, the inside is under construction so take that under consideration.

If you pay for park n fly package you get to park your car there for free up to 14 days.  Perfect if you come from Tucson and want to skip the pay at the terminal parking. Most of my flights are late so it works out perfectly.  Other than that the hotel is in great condition nice and clean.  Great value + free parking = win!
