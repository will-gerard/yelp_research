Our server was Brandi was nice, but must have been new...  Every time we asked her a question on the menu, she would display the deer in the head lights look and say "I don't know."  We went there for happy hour on this Friday late afternoon in February..The restaurant was not busy. Service was very slow, but the food though was good.

Found this place on the west side of town 35ave & Glendale. So glad we did it has a great fish fry on Friday. $ 10.  All you can eat cod. What a deal it comes with frys, coleslaw or potato salad. The service is friendly & good.

We went there for the Wednesday night .50 wings special 7-10pm. They were not so special. They are small wings but they were taste. The fondue & pretzels were pretty good.  Our server was preoccupied with her cell phone texting. She got our order wrong. She would tell us, I'll be back with your drinks. Then space what we needed. She was nice, she told us, I don't know where my heads at. Plus the outside seating was sooo smokey I think it change ownerships and now called Windy city sports grill. It has 2 names on the outside of the building. Thought we would give it a try.  Plus the wings used to be bigger & better.  Service about the same POOR!!!  What is it about the food service industry. They want good / big tips but not willing to supply the decent / respectful service.   We go out spend our hard earned money.   For a good food & service. I hate to keep asking for refills, napkins, to go boxes or our bill...

Arrived to sit down with a good crowd & ambiance. Soon a stinky bar tender assisted with our order. His body oder was so offensive that it made me gag... We didn't want him to come near us. Couldn't even enjoy our meal. Came here on a Monday evening to watch a football game.

Went to get some cupcakes today. Our first time there. We were greeted with a smile & big hello as we walked in. The staff is sweet and friendly. They walked us through their cupcakes & they explained the choices to us. We got six different flavors. Couldn't wait to get home to get a big glass of ice cold milk & eat our cupcakes. We shared the key lime. Had a graham cracker crust, vanilla cake, key lime center, with a meringue frosting. It was Awesome!. Also shared the delicious vanilla with key lime...

Worth the drive from Phoenix. Great pork ribs. Fantastic dry rub & sauce. Excellent barbecue smell out in front of the restaurant on Cave Creek Rd. A tasty side dish is the 6 pack cowboy beans, as they have brisket bits inside. Best BBQ in the Valley...

Cool ambiance inside. The overpriced & known hamburgers fell apart in your hands. They are on small cheap buns. Greasy onion rings. Over-served 2 drunks at the bar...

OHSO is a happening place for happy hour. We enjoyed the $6. - 32oz pitcher's of beers. $3. Pretzel with beer cheese. Wish that the portion was bigger. It was sooo soft warm & yummy... We loved the big juicy burgers too.  I had the burger with thick bacon, gouda cheese, onion straws, & there dressing. Also the Arizona burger jalapeno cream cheese, green chiles, & onion straws.  Very tasty but has a bite. Service was prompt & very friendly:)  Would've like to see a broader selection on the happy hour...

Went here again for the Sunday $15 All-You-Can-Eat BBQ Special from 3pm-7pm. Let me tell you it was NOT that special... Ribs were over cooked and dry, like chewing on beef jerky. The brisket is pulled & had a vinegar awful sauce. It's placed on a slice of white bread. The chicken leg & thigh had that same awful sauce. The cornbread though was excellent. Potato salad & coleslaw were alright. Our waiter was friendly & the service was good.

Hostess was snooty & seemed to be bothered to seat us. Server was nice, but seriously not attentive had to keep waving our hands to try to get a refill. It was not even busy.  The food was a small portion for that price $14.95 each plate. It was just super hot could not even taste any seasonings.  Just had a burning mouth. Couldn't believe that we were charged $1.50 per tortilla.  You only get 1 tortilla with the meal.  Server should of mention the extra fee per tortilla. Will not go there again!!!

A very hip establishment that was hoppin' on this Friday evening during Restaurant Week. Located at Biltmore Fashion Park. Waited about 45 minutes to be sat inside at a booth near the noisy kitchen, The decor was trendy like the new taco joints have become. Overall the food was prepared well that's described in my several pictures. Was Impressed with the chicken fajitas, ceviche, chips, & guacamole. Chicken mole was good. Only memorable criticism is store bought salsa that was surprising to us with a prominent Mexican restaurant...

Went there after a movie at AMC. I don't know how long before we got their that the pizza was made. All they did was warm it up. I was awful, awful, awful, very dry crust & greasy topping. I spoke with the manager he was not willing to correct this issue. Said it was fresh, then why would you need to put it back in the oven...
