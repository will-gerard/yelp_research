I have been going here for sometime and the wings are usually pretty good but the customer service is nonexistent. They did not do my order correctly on multiple occasions and refuse to correct these issues. The management is very rude. Even the employees have advised me that it doesn't matter what you complain about, the management is not the type to care or resolve it. The bathrooms are very dirty and smell horrible. The wings are very small and the price is not the best do yourself a favor eat elsewhere

Staff is cold callous and demeaning ! There is zero patient privacy ! They did not run the proper test before prescribing a dosage of medication I had already tried before then dismissing me as not being sick enough to receive care despite being unable to walk I was completely ignored by their doctors for four more than hours and in the emergency room for more than 8 hours . Their staff talks to all patients like they are trash and they do not take an appropriate medical history or complete appropriate test before just throwing a higher dosage of medication at you . Due to the shared rooming ER policy I knew every thing about the patient next to me, his drug problems and the in identified drugs he was allowed to bring into th hospital unchecked . The nurses simply act like they hate all patients equally while admitted into this hospital in 2014 I got scabies! I would rather die then come here

Went to look at an apartment. The woman was horribly dressed. She was very rude. The apartment she showed us was filthy and smelled horribly of mold and mildew. The pool was cloudy and green and the club house a complete mess.. Very poor conditions on the property.

Have ate here a few times the only thing worth ordering is the pot stickers ! Food is made haphazardly with low quality ingredients and it's poorly prepared!! After tonight's order I will never order from them again the items were just thrown in the bag several items spilled and the pepper beef was awful ! Never going back

Food was horrible . Dumplings barely cooked with zero flavor ! My daughter ordered the wings and they were still bloody

The fact that this place was super busy would imply this place had great value and excellent service. However in going to this restaurant this morning the waitress gave horrible service she was very short and snippy! We immediately given the wrong Drinks which the waitress was irritated with us for. The menu was convoluted with extra charges for nearly everything!! Which would have made the bill for 1 adult and two children more than $50 . We opted out of this over crowded over priced poor service establishment and will never return

I used to eat at this location several times per week . Recently, they have had a change in staff and management. Since then the food quality and taste has gone down dramatically. They also started serving dramatically smaller portions. My last two visits to this location have been awful. The one on mill is much better !! This location has gone down hill
