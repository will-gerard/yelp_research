This place rocks!  About a milion times better than just going to subway.  I have been wanting to try this sandwich shop since I was in highschool, and never did until the other day when my husband asked to try something new for a change, and all I ever want are sandwiches.    The bread is so soft, there are so many meats and so many options that sound delicious, and best of all, I walk out of there actually spending less than I do at subway.  Definately worth a try if you like deli sandwiches on the go.

Update to my review, dined here again recently and it gets better and better.  If you go here, and the special is a meat or fish that you would like, get it.  The specials are SOOO good and really big!  They stay seasonal and change things up, so hard to say exactly what you should get, but the food honestly speaks for itself.  It's worth every penny.  Service is great and friendly as well, and every seat in the room has a good view, so not worth complaining if you don't get a window seat.

Yum Yum Yum. This place is so good.  I love their tuna on 12 grain bread so much that I always want to get something else and end up ordering it anyway.    That being said, when I do venture off of the usual fare, their daily specials are AWESOME.  Whether a new salad, hot sandwich, or cold sandwich, I've never been disappointed by the combos they put together on that specials menu.   One of my favorite sandwich places since I was like 10 years old. :)

I would rate it much higher if it wasn't so pricey.  It seems like it would be a fairly casual restaurant, but the prices are more in line with almost fine dining, so I was surprised to spend that much, which disappointed.  The food was good though, with reasonable portions, but I was expecting more.    Service was also not very good at all. We told our server we were in a hurry and she still took forever to get us our check and get us checked out.   Overall, the food is good and if you feel like 21 dollars for tacos is reasonable, then go for it because they are tasty, but I thought it was a little bit of a jip.

So, this place is great.  The pizza crust tastes like sourdough bread but ten times better, because its in a yummy thin pizza crust.  The gladiator pizza is very meaty and heavy and filling, but also kind of irresistable, with the HUGE pieces of schreiner's sausage and BIG pepperonis.    I have had about half of the pizza styles from here, and I have liked all of them (even goat cheese, which I used to think I would HATE!!)  If you try it once, I guarantee you would want to come back.  I like getting it to go, because I don't often feel comfortable enough pig out on pizza in front of people, and that's what happens with La Grande.

I constantly crave the Vodka Mai Tai.  It is so good, they use almost crushed ice to make it so it is SO cold and so easy to drink! Especially great during happy hour for $6.  It's STRONG, I'm good with just one, so it's not too much for me.  The ceviche was really yummy.  I was sharing but I wanted it all for myself.  I had the hummus as well, that was ok, nothing special.  Overall, a fun environment for happy hour.  The waiters are really nice and FUNNY in the bar.

So so so good!! Very fast and easy! Took my bridesmaid dress in and they did alterations on the neck (halter), waist, and length and had it ready in a matter of days. Offered to let me try it on to ensure the fit was right when I picked it up! Will go back any time I need alterations.

Highly recommend using moving team six. Moved our two story house so quickly and efficiently, also helped move junk items to garage to help us out. Will pack items if you need it, and they are upfront before scheduling what it might generally cost.

Delicious. Right near my ob offices and I haven't had many pregnancy cravings but this place is becoming an addiction. It is so good! No wonder parking is hard and the line is almost always out the door.  It is spicy. Like almost anything you get will end up being spicy, even the pico has jalepenos. But it is really good. I want to try a salad next time, but the enchiladas just call my name. I have only tried the short rib and the pork, but both were good. I agree with the tips about to go containers. Both times I've done it it seems they over cook my food and it sticks to the container. Not burned or anything but just like 30 seconds too long and I have to scrape it off haha. Still good though, totally worth it.   Price wise it's a bit expensive but you get what you pay for here and it's worth it!!! Yum yum!
