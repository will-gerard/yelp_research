Overall the visit was pleasant.  Had pizza (which was very thin) but delicious. Also had the jumbo shrimp with bacon omg was the the best ever!  Definitely would recommend this to everyone  Great experience.

Best icecream ever! Would definitely recommend this to everyone.  They got tons of unique ice cream flavors.  My favorite is their grasshopper mint!

Best spot in Phoenix hands down! The chamango is fire! Definitely coming back! They got all sorts of good stuff. Ice cream, ceviche, corn in a cup, all sorts of good stuff!
