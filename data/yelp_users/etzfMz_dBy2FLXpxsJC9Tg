I would not recommend this dermatology office. I scheduled an appointment months in advanced for a routine skin checkup. When asked if I had any problems, I said there was one spot that was potentially suspicious; not realizing that saying this apparently meant they would look at nothing  else.  After waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time in a relatively empty waiting room, I finally saw the doctor and the entire appointment was about 30 seconds. She ONLY looked at the one spot, telling me I had to to schedule a separate appointment if I wanted her to examine anything else.   The office is clean & the staff were all very polite, but my visit was a colossal waste of time & money.

Sakana's lunch specials are where it's at! The "Sakana lunch" gives you miso soup, salad, six pieces of sashimi, and a California roll for $10, which is pretty unbeatable considering the quality.   The fish is always super fresh & the service is consistently great.

The double black diamond martini is worth five stars alone....those suckers are dangerously delicious.  The service, ambiance, and food here are always fantastic.   Last time I was here (10/24), my steak was very over salted and my salad was hideously overdressed, but I won't hold it against this place.

The food here is fantastic and the owner, Swani, is the sweetest lady! The building is nothing too flashy, very casual atmosphere. The service is definitely top notch here and the house chicken is always delicious.   They have a great lunch special, but make sure to check the hours before visiting, as they do close for a short period during the afternoon.

Chino Bandito is the ultimate lovechild between Mexican and Chinese food...and tastes even better than the combo sounds. Kind of a hole in the wall, but in the best kind of way.   Order at the counter using paper slips, and don't forget to stop by the sampling area...they'll let you taste everything before you order. One of the best parts...you can get anything on the menu in quesadilla form. The other best part is the fresh baked cookie you get with every meal.  Jerk fried rice, black beans, emerald chicken, and jade red chicken quesadillas are my go to.

Some of the best cheap, no frills Mexican food in Phoenix. Their tortillas are next level, the beans & salsa are delicious, and you can't beat the price for a $4 burrito. The green machaca is an absolute must order!

This place is perfect for riding a bike to and grabbing a bite and few beers. I love that they have indoor bike racks viewable from the bar; a perfect feature for people like me who always forget my lock.   They have pretty fantastic drink specials and a solid craft beer list. All September they're doing $3 Oskar Blues cans. They also do all day happy hour on Saturday's, half price pizza on Monday's, and Trivia Night on Tuesday's & Sunday's.   I can't say the food is anything worth writing home about, but for what they offer they do it well & the service has always been great. All around a good place!

La's is one of our go-to Thai restaurants in Phoenix. Their Pad Thai is some of the best I've had in the area.   The place is relatively small, I wouldn't suggest bringing a large group here (more than 8-10 people). The service is usually quick, and the owner & her daughter Lisa are very sweet! We end up chatting with them almost every time we come in.

They did not honor the 15 class pass I purchased on Groupon. I had neurotically looked over the deal before purchasing, and it had said valid for clients not active in the last 6 months. I went to redeem it today & the rules had changed to 12 months, so my pass was invalid since I'd taken a class there 10 months ago. But I was allowed to put that $45 towards two classes.   Ugh, no thank you.   I called Groupon and they confirmed that the rules had been edited AFTER I'd purchased it, which they agreed was against their policy and issued me a full refund.   Very shifty, True Hot Yoga.

Dr. Ostler is the best the West Valley has to offer. I could not be more pleased with the dental care I've received from Dr. Ostler & his staff over the last few years. For the first time, I don't put off scheduling my twice yearly cleanings!   The office is clean & comfortable, with individual TV's above each exam chair for patients to watch while having a procedure or cleaning done (a nice touch for early morning appointments for my fellow non-morning people).  The hygienists & assistants are super friendly, and Dr. Ostler is a fantastic dentist. He's very personable and seems to be incredibly thorough, knowledgeable, & proficient at all the procedures he provides.  I would highly recommend this office!

DO NOT PRACTICE HERE! I repeat, GO LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE. I've been practicing yoga for six years & have explored many different styles at a variety of studios...and I've never experienced this level of disrespect.  The owner, Ben, is a complete pervert and a psychopath. Where to even begin my story...  Well, let's start w/ walking in. They start by preaching a bunch of BS trying to sell you on their overpriced, highly synthetic Herbalife supplement packages. You'll notice the walls full of books declaring "Bikram Choudhury is Jesus & the Buddha combined". Creepy as hell....especially seeing as how this man has allegedly raped at least six women.   The inside of the heated, humid studio has repulsive brown carpet which reeks of mildew & dirty feet. Instructors SCREAM non-alignment related commands ("AND STRETCH AND STRETCH AND STRETCH!!") repeatedly, as if it's an aerobics class, into a boom mic from a raised altar.   So anyway, I have a knee injury & have been taught a minor alignment change by other teachers to help support that (grabbing my ankles instead of feet in one posture)...simple fix. Anyway, Ben harassed me during every class about this issue...belittling me personally, repeatedly & loudly over the PA system in front of everyone, every time I attended, even though I spoke with him about it after my first class. He insisted that the practice must be done ONE way, & that Bikram knows my body better than I do...telling me I should do the posture even if it injures me because it won't. WTF?  When he asked if I'd like to sign up to renew my membership early, I firmly told him no. He took me into his office to speak about it privately, and I told him I didn't feel entirely respected. I asked to not be called out so severely and repeatedly during class for non-alignment related issues, as it was embarrassing. He told me I was a "beautiful girl", but I needed to do as I am instructed.  I told him I wouldn't ignore cues from my body just to follow Bikram's "protocol" for postures, and he told me I was banned from ever coming back. When I asked him if I could finish out the rest of my class pass first, he told me he would CALL THE POLICE if I ever came back. He proceeded to follow me to my car, threatening me the entire way.  So in short, I'm screwed out of the money I paid for a very overpriced membership for kindly asking not to be harassed.  I've filed a complaint with the Better Business Business Bureau, I suggest anyone who's had a similar experience here do the same.   True Hot Yoga at 67th & the 101 is an infinitely superior, cleaner, and more respectful studio that's only about a mile away.

Angel's Trumpet is one of my favorite stops to hit in downtown Phoenix. Really nice atmosphere, excellent and friendly service, and a fantastic rotating beer list. Definitely a good spot to grab a bite & a brew. Super bike friendly w/ a great patio area.   Tuesday's are the best, when they have a different weekly "TV dinner" special for only $7. You get a variety of delicious items that fit within a certain theme, served on cute "school lunch" trays.

Chopshop is the perfect stop for a healthy lunch. Tons of fresh options for juices, salads, sandwiches, wraps, and rice bowls. The "protein bowls" are all delicious; Brown or forbidden rice (black rice) with grilled veggies and meat or tofu.  My ONLY complaint...is that the protein bowls are frequently cold by the time they arrive at the table. Which is a huge bummer, because they're delicious otherwise.

Great environment and wide variety of beer choices, both bottled and on tap. The concept for 90% of the menu is the same...essentially a gourmet "hot pocket" type baked sandwich with a flaky croissant-like crust stuffed with a wide selection of fillings for different (mostly savory) flavor profiles.The vibe of the restaurant is very "old pub" with wooden bench seating and dim lighting, but they also have a fantastic patio/outdoor bar area.  Cornish Pasty is one of those places with something for everyone. I really appreciate that one entire side of the menu is dedicated to vegan and vegetarian menu items; the spicy asiago is one of my favorites! The soups and desserts are are also equally delicious, and it's always hard to pass up a banoffee pie or caramel apple pasty for dessert.

All the hype surrounding this place is real...Little Miss BBQ has the best in Phoenix. Though it's impossible to go wrong with anything on the menu, the brisket is to die for. The jalape√±o cheddar grits & pecan pie are also pretty next level, and the sauces  are delicious.   Plan to get here early (before it opens on weekends is ideal because the lines are long), but it's well worth the wait. I've never in my life experienced meat that tastes this good anywhere else.

This new location improved upon an already great setup. They have a fantastic happy hour & killer patio area! The ambiance is on point and the atmosphere is the perfect place to grab a pitcher of beer, a yummy bite, and play some cornhole or foosball with some friends.  Bonus points: they even offer doggie treats to take home that they make with the spent grain from brewing.

Rage is easily one of the best bikes shops in the Valley, I've never left feeling anything other than impressed. The shop has an awesome vibe, a great selection of bikes & gear, fair prices, and the best customer service I've ever seen from a shop.   I came in initially looking to buy a specific Brooks saddle, but they didn't carry the women's model I was looking for. Instead of just saying "no" as most shops would, they immediately started calling all the other shops in the area to see if anyone else had it. I was pretty taken aback by their desire to actually help their customers instead of just make money on them, and have been back with several small repairs on my bike since.  I sometimes got an "uppity" vibe from Landis and felt embarrassed to bring my "beginner" problems & questions there, but the staff at Rage is awesome. I can't wait to order my new Salsa cycle from them in the near future!
