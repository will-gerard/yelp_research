Came in with my dad during one sweltering August night, lured in by the cute 50's ambience and by the nostalgia of going to the Sugar Bowl as a kid.  The people who worked there were simply rude, barely acknowledging our presence.  When we ordered I saw that he scooped out of a container that said Dreyer's. If a sundae could be bland, this was. I know a lot of places used mass-produced ice cream, but I would go to Sweet Republic in a heartbeat over this place.

I am writing to sing the praises of the Ni√ßoise salad.  The seared tuna on it was flawlessly prepared, the haricot verts were perfectly al dente and I loved the touch of roasted tomatoes. And at $13 which may seem a little steep, it was a lot of food---I didn't finish it.  The people that worked there were very friendly.   It's a little hard to find, being at the back of the shopping center next to Crudo.

It's hard to go wrong at The Mission.  The atmosphere is just beautiful, candles strewn all around ---almost reminiscent of a church (appropriate given the name!)---Eating in the backyard is really an experience on a cooler night.  All of the tacos are phenomenal and have interesting ingredients that just pop.  The street corn is to die for, and the milkshake churro dessert is a go-to for me.  The cinnamon they use in the milkshake is awesome.   The servers are all really knowledgeable, and the service itself is generally outstanding.  It is trendy without being pretentious.   GO GO GO!

This is my go-to starbucks. The people who work here are really friendly. The outdoor seating along Mayo boulevard is strangely peaceful if you want a little respite from your day.  It's generally not over-crowded which is a nice change from some of the starbucks on or near Frank Lloyd wright blvd.  My only complaint is the outlet situation. If you're coming here to do work on a computer there sometimes aren't enough outlets, and some of the outlets are near comfy chairs instead of near tables.

I'm really sad to say this but I think this cute little shop has closed its doors. Unless it somehow moved, but that's probably wishful thinking. Sighhh.  Wish Phoenix could sustain more local boutiques like this.

I knocked a star off because the ambiance and parking aren't great. The ambiance is pretty 80s style and kind of cheesy.  If it's nice out, definitely opt to sit outside---you'll feel like you're on someone's patio, not in the middle of Scottsdale promenade. Prices are the most reasonable I've found in Scottsdale. Service is great.  They have a good selection of sake, pinnacle vodkas and fountain soda (weeeeeee!!!!).   The manager (Jay?) is a doll--he was so helpful in picking out the perfect amount of food for an event I was hosting at work. The fish was all supremely fresh and tasty, and it was packaged and displayed beautifully and with the utmost care.   Finally, I need to sing the praises of the spicy tuna roll at Yume. It's the best I've ever had - not only in Phoenix, but ever (this is saying a lot as I've lived in NY and eaten a lot of spicy tuna in my day).  It is made with no mayo---just pure heat.  Try it!

I've been here 3 times now, and every time it's been great.  It is the closest I've come to finding the pseudo-Mexican that I've enjoyed in other cities.  The fried fish tacos were outstanding.  Amazing flavor and the ingredients all balanced each other out.  The waitstaff is really friendly and knowledgeable.  I think the restaurant inside is a little dark, a little loud, and poorly laid out.  All the tables in the front are all bar height, so if that's not your thing eat in the back or outside.  The special guacamole with mango and goat cheese was fair.  I'd stick to the regular.

I think the issue with this place is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. The name would imply a coffee shop. The girls working there: a hooters style coffee shop?! The food, a lunch place. The hours, a pseudo bar. I'm sort of indifferent to the dress of the women but definitely felt strange ordering a "d cup". Can't speak for the food, but the coffee was decent.

If you can catch this place open, it's a real gem. Monique is the owner and also the dressmaker. Her dresses are incredible, whimsical creations. She does bridal, ranging from ethereal to more edgy creations, as well as more everyday apparel. If you don't see anything you like you can also custom order it. She is a real talent. On top of that there are some really funky accessories, especially the beautiful jewelry from Xappaland. The girls that work there are really nice and helpful---check it out!

I've had a few mixed experiences here.   What I like is that there are no TVs and it is a nice, well-ventilated area. The only technician I've had here who I thought did a phenomenal job is Liz.  The other mani/pedis I've had here haven't lasted very long at all.    My other frustration is that on two occasions, despite having made an appointment, I had to wait a long time. The first time, and I kid you not, I waited 45 minutes.  The second time close to 20 before anyone started on me. All the while, I see people with the same appointment time almost done with their pedicures.  If I didn't know better I would say it was personal, but I think it's probably just indicative of poor management.    I may be back, and hopefully the 3rd pitch won't be a total strike-out

Having grown up on Long Island and having lived in New York City, I know my pizza. And by pizza I mean New York style pizza. Basil and Garlic Bistro is the closest thing I've had to New York pizza. I wonder if they import the water for the dough? It is seriously good. The bottom is crispy and not burnt.  And the place has an air of authenticity in that the owners are bonafide New Yorkers, complete with Brooklyn accents. The ambience is ok, it's a little dark and cramped but there is something so New York about that too. Go and experience the cheesy deliciousness.

I had heard rave reviews of the Bink restaurants and was excited for my first foray.  Well, that excitement was soon tempered by a less-than-stellar experience.  We arrived and were seated.  I took a good 7 minutes for us to even be acknowledged at our seats.  Finally, we asked for some water which was brought to us with a perfunctory "sorry."  Then, we had to ASK for bread.  Finally, our drink orders were taken, and we waited for our drinks in the time it would've taken to ferment a glass of wine.  The gimlet I had was just meh.  I've had better.    Then, it took forever for the waiter to take our food order.  Once he did, we waited, and waited.....and waited.   He then told us that they were short-staffed that night and was profusely apologetic.  That helped ease the experience, but frankly not enough.  The butternut squash soup was good, but overall the food wasn't great.  The cauliflower tasted like they had haphazardly emptied their entire artisanal salt shaker onto it.  It wasn't worth complaining about, because by the time we could get anyone's attention and a new order it would've been a good hour.  I recommend the push-pop dessert which was made with lime sorbet and oatmeal ice cream.  It tasted like a key lime pie.  It was made ahead of time so was actually brought out rather quickly.

The gelato here is plain delicious---I would schlep 40 miles to the one In Gilbert to get some of this creamy deliciousness, so naturally I was thrilled when Frost opened at the Biltmore.    Speaking from experience, you won't leave with the same heavy feeling eating a bowl of regular ice cream will sometimes give you. You can also sample as many flavors as you want! I went with the straciatella and gianduja. If you like Nutella try the gianduja. Rich and delicious.   I did have a little trouble finding it...it's facing Camelback and is next to True Food.  FYI...they don't have a public restroom.

It could be because I came around 4:30pm, but the chocolate covered  "Twinkie"  I ordered, filled with buttercream and yellow cake, was dry and kind of tasteless. The cupcakes were huge which was why I opted for the smaller Twinkie for a little pre-dinner sweet snack. I love baked goods but this was a waste of calories and $4 to boot.  I would try the bakery earlier in the day and opt for a cupcake instead ---I concede I may have ordered poorly.

Located at the New Vision Center for Spiritual Living. Surya Yoga is an amazing place started by an amazing person.   The teachers are extremely accessible, and the studio space itself is soothing.  I regularly attend classes with Lacey and Erin who both have a calm and beautiful presence about them.   They encourage students to work within their own comfort zone and to get in touch with the "oneness" of it all.  Both Erin and Lacey give adjustments during their classes---which I love.      The classes are also relatively frequent and at great times.  I LOVE that they have a Satuday afternoon class, which is rare for most other studios in the valley.    Check it out!

A boutique with unique findings at various price points.  The owner was extremely friendly and has a passion for what she does. She was so excited to tell me about the Australian brands they will be getting in stock. They carry fun brands such as Mink Pink and Amuse Society. Will be back!

Having just eaten here, my tastebuds are dancing!  You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your seats. There are tons of vegan and gluten-free options. I came with two friends and so I was able to try a lot of dishes, and one was more delicious than the next! Both the Vegetable Chopped and Superfood salads were gigantic (as they should be at $10 a pop) and delicious. They forgot my apricots in my salad and were very gracious about it, quickly adding them.  I especially recommend the miso dressing.   I also tried the 'Faux Pho,' a vegetarian version.  The broth was particularly good and tasted almost like meat---very savory. The black bean tacos were tasty. Be aware, the menu doesn't list that they come on corn tortillas.  A great breakfast/lunch option in North Scottsdale.
