The first thing I must say about the Phoenix City Grill is that the owner of this place ROCKS!!! All restaurant owners need to take a page out of this guys book. Reason in a second. Let's talk about food first.  I had the baby back ribs and the were awesome. Not quite as good as the baby backs from Houstons but pretty darn close. My girlfriend who loves PCG decided to go with something different this time around and ordered one of their signature dishes. It was some sort of chicken. I do consider myself a foodie so the first thing I was thinking is how can chicken be a signature dish? Chicken is boring no matter what you do with it. Anyway, it wasn't that good and the chicken comes on the bone which my girlfriend didn't like. So, since it was a signature dish, recommended by the waiter, I had to return it. My philosphy is that if something is recommended and is a signature dish and it doesn't give you a mouthgasim, it gets returned. So the waiter nicely takes it back and apologizes multiple times and asks if we would like something else. My girlfriend orders her old PCG standby, the Pork Tenderloin. Wow what a great pork dish. I don't care for pork that much but i must say i crushed half of it, it was amazing.  Do I even need to explain the choclate tort??? YUM  Back to the owner. We arrive at PCG at about 4pm to eat dinner, who eats at 4pm, you'd think we went for the early bird special. We get seated in the dining room and are the only ones in the dining room and no one comes out for like 10 minutes. So we move to the bar  and tell the bar tender we are going to eat at the bar because no one came out to greet us or take a drink order. He apologizes, bvut it was NO BIG DEAL. We weren't mad or complaining or anything. Remember earlier I mentioned the signature dish that got sent back. Well the owner comes over to us and says i understand you have had some issues today and we are like ah no problem the food was great yada yada yada. The owner is like NO BOTH of your meals are on me including dessert. We objected and were like you don't have to do that and he INSISTED. Who does this now a days in the restauran business? Most definately not Donovans.  Anyway to sum it up. PCG is awesome, the owner actually cares about his customers and everyone i tell this story to they are like i can't believe he did that. Go to Phoenix City Grille you won't be disappointed. KUDOS to PCG and especially you Mr. Owner, sorry I don't remember your name. I'll be for some ribs soon.

So I've been told by someone that Uncle Sams has the best cheese steaks in town. I finally made it to the 32nd & Shea location and tried these so called best cheese steaks in town.  Being the food snob I am and somewhat of a cheese steak expert, I must say Uncle Sams has SOME of the best cheese steaks in. A close second in my opinion. The only cheese steak I've have in the PHX area that was better was at Flancers in Gilbert. Flancers are by far the best cheese steaks in town.  I will be back to Uncle Sams for another cheese steak and maybe give the pizza a try.

I consider myself an expert on Mexican food and all I can say is Carolinas is the BOMB!!! If not the best, one of the best Mexican joints in PHX. The bean and cheese burrito was awesome and the machaca tacos were off the hook. It's the first time I've had machaca and it is fantastic. Carolinas is a must visit Valley establishment.

I'll keep this one short and sweet. The only thing I can say about Flancers is that Flancers is AWESOME. By far the best lunch spot in town. The one in Gilbert is small and gets packed for lunch. The staff at the Gilbert location is awesome I feel like Norm from cheers when I walk in. Big Myke, Ben, Thomas and everyone else treat the customers of Flancers like they are their best friends.  Must have are: Best Cheesesteak in town, the It's About Tyme Sandwich, Pizza, and the french fries.   I really wish there was a Flancers in the Arcadia area.

Royal Taj is great Indian food. I was never a fan of Indian food until a friend took me to Royal Taj and made me order the chicken tikka masala. Boy was I suprised, it was awesome and the garlic naan we ordered with it was YUMMY. Be careful if you don't like spicey food because I ordered mine medium spice and iit still made my nose run a bit. Royal Taj also has a 9.99 lunch buffet that is pretty good for the price. The food on the buffet isn't as good as if you order fresh off the menu so don't judge Royal Taj on the buffet alone. I've tried a few other Indian restaurants since I started loving Royal Taj and have not found one yet who has a better chicken tikka masala. If you like Indian food, Royal Taj is a must try.

Lifetime fitness is the bomb. How do I know this? Because I have worked out at probably 100 different gyms during my 8 years of traveling the country playing minor league baseball.   At Lifetime you get what you pay for and Lifetime is not cheap. It's always meticulously clean, stocked with towels and has plenty of free and pay for classes if you like classes. If you wanted to, you could literally spend the whole day at Lifetime at have everything you need from the cafe, pool, child care (max 2 hours), hair and nail salon, free WiFi, lounging area in the locker room with couches and a flat screen TV, Jacuzzi, sauna, etc, etc, etc.   If you don't mind the price, 40/mnth for a basic membership, you will love Lifetime and never want to work out anywhere else.

Salon Tru is very nice salon, but a little pricey. I think you get what you pay for though.  I get my hair cut by Jessica and I love her!!!! I give her free reign on my hair and just let her do whatever she wants. She just knows that my hair style can't be too "out there" or make me look like a 35 year old who is trying wayyyyyyy to hard. If you are a guy looking for a good style and aren't afraid to go to an actuall salon, check out Salon Tru and ask for Jessica. You won't be disappointed

The Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican joints in town. If you are looking for traditional Mexican you might be disappointed with Barrio because Barrion Cafe serves what i like to call neuvo Mexican. I can't really explain what i mean by that...LOL...all I can tell you is that the food is FANTASTIC. My favorites are the Enchiladas del Mar and the Lobster Quesadillas....YUM. Oh did I mention the table side guacamole? Yeah it's the BOMB. So if you want one of the best Mexican meals in town with a twist then Barrio is where it's at.

The food and service at this place SUCKS....Stay away if you are thinking of having your Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner here.  I've been to the Hole in the Wall several times to see an old school bluegrass band called Joshua Stone. Joshua Stone is the only thing at the Hole in the Wall that I have anything good to say about.  Service here is terrible. EVERY time I come here it's like I'm invisible, I mean our group, is invisible. How do you fail to notice the group of anywhere from 5 to 10 people? In one instance, there were 10 of us and we all ordered drinks, food, and smores. All the drinks and smores came and some of the food so we figured the burger would be coming out soon. No big deal or so we thought. After about 10 minutes we realized the burger wasn't coming so we ask the waitress where the burger was and she, in a somewhat irritated tone, was like you guys didn't order a burger and we were like yes we did. She continued to tell us we didn't order a burger and finally we were like, ok, just bring us a burger and fries. 20 minutes later the burger shows up and it was good. But what really chaps my ass is that they had the nerve to charge us for it. Now I'm not looking for a hand out, but come on isn't that customer service 101.  On to my next rant about this establishment that should be called the S**t Hole in the Wall.  We went there for Thanksgiving dinner expecting a fantastic buffet. Now keep in mind my girlfriend and her family have been going to this "buffet" for like 10 years or something crazy so all I've been hearing about for the month prior to Thanksgiving is how wonderful this buffet is. Ummmm, can you say terrible. where to start. Trust me keep reading.   1. No buffet. It was changed to "family style." Last time I checked family style was a choice of certain things and then the food keeps coming until you are done. NOT HERE. As the waitress said, "we can bring more food, but would have to charge you. REALLY!!!  2. Waitress didn't give a damn. we waited probably 5 minutes before or drink order was taken, we didn't get plates until about 2 minutes after our food came, when we complained about the stuffing that was as dry as saw dust she just took it from our table and didn't replace it with another side. Oh and when we were ordering we asked about what tasted good and she was like I haven't tried any of the food. Come on Man!!!  3. Desserts were a joke. it looks like they were bought from the Circle K and they were served cold. Cold apple tart and pecan pie. Not good.  4. Manager never showed his/her face. maybe there was no manager, after all it was a holiday....lol.  5. Lastly, well there is alot more but I'm over it, but this needs to be mentioned. Our server tried to double tip us. The tip was included because we were a table of 10, but we split the bill and when it came she added the tip in again. She should have been fired, but again the manager was non-existent.  Summary.....don't waste your time here unless you are going to see Joshua Stone and only want drinks. I'm done.

Alot of you might be wondering why i would write a review on a fst food chain like Rubios. Well if you have had Rubios Gourmet Steak or Shrimp Tacos you know why I am writing this review. If you haven't had the Gourmet Steak or Shrimp Tacos then hold on to your tate buds because these bad boys are as good as they get. The Gourmet Steak is BY FAR the best taco, of any kind, that I have ever had. I'm not even going to get into everything that is in it, but when they ask you if you want the bacon in it say YES. This will be a taco that you crave, but beware at 340 calories per tacos if you eat to many you might pack on the pounds.  Let me know if you think these Gourmet Tacos are as good as I say they are.

Being a big fan of the high end steak houses in town, I had to try Donovans. For some reason as I frequent City Hall, Ocean Club & Capital Grill, Donovans has always seemed to slip my memory. Now I know why, my experience at Donovans was absolutely TERRIBLE. Seriously 3 out of the four people who ate there said they have had better steaks at Outback and I agree.   Let me start with the reasons why Donovans got 2 stars instead of 1. First, the wait staff captian John delivered impeccable service and should be commended with the way he handled a table who had 3 terrible, flovorless steaks. Second, the 2 bottles of 2005 Silveroak were fantastic, but at 160 a bottle it should be good. Third and the last reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because the filet medallions topped blue cheese were absolutely fantastic.  I would never go back to Donovans unless they offered my a free dinner with wine to redeem themselves. I know some of the Yelpers out there might think I'm angeling but we spents oveer $600 on dinner for 4 with 2 bottles of wine. BTW that $600 was after John took off one full Ribeye and half off another entree. I can personally say that my filet was charred, sent it back, came back flavorless and the bacon wrapped scallops were dry and tastless as well.  If you are looking for a excellent high end steak house stick to City Hall, OC, Capital Grill. I would really be impressed if someone from Donovans saw this review and offered to redeem themselves. Reviews can be ammended.

I had one of the worst shopping experiences last night at NM Last. Very disappointing considering I WAS a loyal fan. Maybe its my fault but I had a return that was less than 60 days old and the Manager at NM Last Call pretty much told me sorry about you luck we have a 30 day return policy. I was very nice to the gentleman explaining that I was trying to exchange my jeans for another pair but there weren't any that fit. Manager was like too bad we can't give you a refund and you are lucky I'm authorizing an exchange because we're not supposed to do that either.  Like I said probably my fault that I didn't read the back of my receipt but since when does a store like NM not make the customer happy: I even had my receipt. BAD customer service soooo disappointed and may never go back to NM Last Call because of this. Hopefully someone high up will see this posting and take action. Bad news travels fast.

Pan Asia is one of Phoenix's hidden jewels. Tucked away in a strip center on 24th & Baseline, Pan Asia is a great alternative to expensive, trendy sushi joints. I eat sushi at Pan Asia at least every other weekend and can say that Pan Asia's sushi is just as good if not better than RA. Not to mention cheaper, especially if you go there on one of their half off Saturday's or during happy hour.   I feel like Norm from Cheers when I go there and the staff is very friendly. Their friendliness is what you should come to expect from a family run restaurant. I especially like John who is hilarious. If you get to know John he will keep you laughing the whole time you are there and will make sure your drinks are never empty.   I highly recommend the Fire Roll, a California roll with a nice sized sauteed shrimp on top drizzled with a sweet and mildly spicy sauce surrounded with Bacardi 151 that they light on fire to create the ultimate sushi experience. For tuna lovers, go with the Sama Roll which is a spicy tuna roll topped with a black peppered spiced slice of Ahi.   Hope this review helps and if you are in on a Friday or Saturday night I'm sure you'll see me there. Can you pick me out???

What can I say about the Arcadia Tavern? well actually quite a bit since it is walking distance from my house. I was a little skeptical because since I have lived in the Arcadia area there have been several different establishments in the Arcadia Tavern building.   i must say when I first walked in I was shocked to see they had taken over the space next door and really opened the bar/restaurant up. It is a great place to watch a game because it's chock full of flat screens, has great beer, and bar menu. I must say that the best thing on the menu are the buffalo chicken sliders. They are a must have. So are the tater tots. Tater tots make me feel like a kid all over again....lol...I also really like the Thursday $3 Dos Equis special served in a goblet. So the good, food, drinks, atmosphere. The bad? The service is mediocre but the bar staff is cute which I guess makes up for mediocre service. Also a bit pricey, but not toooo out of line.   The Arcadia Tavern is a must visit restaurant/bar. You won't be disappointed.

I eat at Zipps on a regular basis and it's a good place to take kids because it's loud and no one can hear the kids if they get loud or out of control. The wings at Zipps in my opinion are the best in town. If anyone thinks different send me a message and let me know because i am always looking for great chicken wings.  Overall the food is good, great kids menu, and great happy hour. Service is what you would expect at a sports bar, not bad but not great. A definite must try.

So my girlfriend who is a sales rep for a cell phone company and calls on Apache Junction. She tells me about this little mexican joint that is off the hook. I'm thinking off the hook and AJ don't usually go together. Until now.  Los Tacos was worth the drive from South Phoenix. Let me start by saying it's hands down the cleanest mexican restaurant I've EVER seen. I thought they just opened but the owner said they've been open 3 years.   The food is great and the carne asada was the best I've had in a long time. Excellent beef and chicken tacos especially the hard shells.  Overall, excellent food, great service from the owner. It's evident she cares about her customers. Los Tacos is a must try if you are in AJ or if you want to make a drive for  some great mexican food.

Food is great. Staff is fantastic. The owner John makes eveyone feel like a regular. I've tried 5 different things on the menu and my 2 favorites area the steak panini and BLTC panini.  Steak panini is the BOMB. Food is freshly prepared and presented. Not what you would expect from a "suedo" fast food restaurant.  Finally a healthy alternative in South Phoenix. Keep up the good work GreenMix and don't skimp on the fresh ingredients.

So as anyone can see from my reviews, this is my third review of Green Mix. I went from 5 stars when they first opened down to 3 stars because they were skimping on things.  Now for an update. If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would. They have gone back to the way things were when they first opened. Better portions, fresh food & a very clean restaurant. It always makes me happy when I see restaurants take comments from Yelp and fix any problems there might be and it looks like Green Mix has done just that. Good job Green Mix you have gotten me back as a loyal customer.  A couple things I would like to see implemented. Maybe some better lunch deals, sandwich's are still a bit pricey for being next to Subway. The quality of your food blows Subway away but we are in a deep recession and a $5 foot long seems more appealing. The other thing and the BIGGEST complaint I have is NO KIDS menu. When I drive by at night the place is a ghost town and it might be because families will not come to Green Mix because of the lack of a kids menu. I know for our family, with 4 kids, you will never get our night or weekend business because there is NO KIDS menu. Why not have a grilled cheese or BLT that can be put on something other then a panini.  Other then that, good job getting the food portions and standards back to where they were when you first opened.
