This place is the absolute best. Having celiacs makes eating out extremely difficult and can feel very limiting and isolated at times but Picassos makes us feel like we can eat anything again (because we can on their menu!). Not only that but the food actually tastes amazing! No cardboard cheese bread here! Absolutely love this place!!!

Disgusting. Found five hairs in my egg roll. Called the restaurant and the best they would do is half off my order. I guess that's fair they did give us half of their cooks beard.  Amendment we actually have now found a sixth hair in the entree. Apparently it was not just the egg rolls.
