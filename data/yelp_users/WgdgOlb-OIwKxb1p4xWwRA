The beer is truly amazing, the food is good.  Bartenders are friendly and quick to be helpful - along with management always friendly and honest to god happy to see you and hear your thoughts.   Great place to watch sports, chat up new friends, and drink some great brew beer by Brian Helton. LOVE IT!!!

Absolutely delicious!  Homemade pasta that tastes as smooth as butter when it touches your tongue. Wine selection that makes your mouth water before you even take your first sip.  A definite try if you love genuine Italian cuisine and crave the magnificent taste of homemade pasta.

The customer service here is AWFUL!  The manager is less than nice, even at the best of times.  I was at Zipps recently for several college ball games, where thank goodness Megan our server was amazing, because the rest of the service was horrible. Not only was I in attendance for bad behavior on management's part, but also able to read an atrocious letter written to a friend simply because she wrote a bad review. I will NEVER be stepping foot in Zipps again, and will be forwarding the letter to ALL my friends.  The food isnt that great, and the beer is cheaper is most other establishments, where management is generally nicer.  I only wish I could give ZERO STARS!

My friend suggested we meet at Bad Donkey in Cave Creek, off Tom Darlington. The name alone gave me a little chuckle. Entering I realized its not your little place... There are 3 sections! Food, Drink, Dessert... AMAZING food, Inexpensive drinks, and DELICIOUS ice cream.  Definitely suggest stopping in, and having a quick bite followed by dessert ( for sure grab a beverage if you drink) and then enjoy the rest of your day up in Cave Creek.  Loved it!!!

Love it here on Saturday for lunch and a bit of sports! Wings are delicious... just cant beat the great atmosphere. Location doesnt hurt either :)  Happy Hour prices are really great, and the service is great. Food delicious. Best thing is not only are they accomodating to big groups but there is no bad place to sit in this place- great to watch any sporting event.

THIS PLACE IS GREAT!   Not only did they have a ton of tv's but the happy hour prices are great!  The food is delicious, and the servers friendly and happy.  A group of us went for the Univ. of Washington game and they were fabulous to us. Greatly accommodating, and very friendly. LOVED that they put the sound on pretty high for us and our server even joined in for some boo's and cheers.   Definitely planning on going back!

AMAZING & FUN atmosphere. Not only do they serve one of my favorite beers(Strongbow) but the food is truly delicious. We originally stopped in for some live music, and found that not only did we love the music, the decor, the drinks and the food but the people are also fantastic!   Love this place -everyone should definitely try the curry, oh and the fish and chips with malt vinegar.  Dont forget to stop in on a day they have live music!

Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(  The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.  I'll pass.

A table of 18 and a fairly empty restaurant with an over hour wait for food. Its ridiculous, and as our food arrives its overcooked, no condiments, and no food reprieve for the others at the table still waiting. No apologies, no checking in with us. RIDICULOUS!

Obviously a glutton for punishment- been here 3 times and EVERY time our service is ATROCIOUS. The pie is amazing- but cold when it gets to us.  And seriously... Management stands around texting?! EVERY time we have been there.  I'll buy the pie to go next time if ever a next time.  Happy Hours prices - STILL TOO EXPENSIVE  (drinks are cheaper and more quantity at other places) Happy Hour food - Over priced, and not that great  Pie- Awesome, you should try it for sure..... BUT YES VERY PRICEY  just too expensive of a place to continue going, when the service is sooo bad.

Lush Burger here I come again!   Talk about a delicious hunk of meat! Not only is the burger a big size but the fries----- OH MY GOODNESS! We opted for the Truffle Oil Fries, and our friends did the 50/50 ( regular fries, sweet potatoe)  We ordered a Clint Eastwood burger, and a Lush Classic(although I was eyeing the Kobe beef burger the ENTIRE time). Menu is easy to read, and a flash screen helps you see what your burger will look like when made! The beverage cups are HUGE, and the choices fantastic!  Beverage lists include, wine, beer, and champagne- Yes! you heard right. Price is perfect for the portion sizes, and if you live in the area look for your coupon card.   The decor is amazing! I felt super comfy in their booth, and even more comfy outside while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. They were extremely accomodating for our friends that have children with SEVERE food allergies-- a TRUE RECOMMENDATION for anyone with food allergies looking for an accomodating place without the severe looks of disdain.  LOVED IT! And definitely plan to go back

Love other locations, this one-NOT SO MUCH.  Took FOREVER for our server to ask us for a drink order. The table was dirty when we arrived, although more than 75% of the bar was empty at the time.   Our drinks finally arrive via someone other than our original server(who was MIA for at least a good 5 mins or more), we were finished and waiting for our server to get back to ask for our tab!  Horrible service, and truly disappointed about that since we absolutely love  Buffalo Wild Wings in general.

No Thanks!   Happy Hour specials are not that great, and definitely not worth waiting a long time while sitting at the bar and there are 5 bartenders fiddling their thumbs. Definitely not good to have 3 bartenders in an hour period and then when tabbing out the 3rd bartender cops an attitude b/c we cant remember if we already paid for one or two of our drinks, considering we were asked to tab out 10 mins into our 1st drink!   Food is less than average, WHERE is the flavor???  The staff seemed completed LOST! No thanks!

Beautiful atmosphere... awesome food!  Saturday and Sunday they have bottomless pit Mimosas and Bloody Mary's which just adds to the fantastic atmosphere and peaceful surroundings. The staff is nice, and dressed cute. Love that they use Tom's shoes ( proceeds from Tom's shoes go to charity).  Try the food, definitely sit outside at least once because you will see the gorgeous Arizona atmosphere, and live real life perfect weather.   A definite gotta check this place out!

Great Pie! The small pie is perfect for two people -awesome date place. Stuffed mushrooms a great added bonus to the meal. (the artichoke, and Italian sausage made those mushroom oh so yummy!)  If you can ever make it there for happy hour you should, and not just for the pricing but to try all the other small serving items on the happy hour menu. Such a great way to start the evening and end it with their desserts!  Fantastic food and fantastic service.
