I have to say I am extremely disappointed in the experience my family had last night with the "Picture with Santa" people last night. We went way early so we wouldn't have to stand in line. The lady at the beginning of the line said there was only ONE pack. It was $29.99 and that was the only option. So of course I bought it. Once I had paid and was leaving, I heard another employee ask the lady behind me, WHich pack did you purchase. HUH? I thought there was only one. Well looks like I was conned into buying the most expensive one. CAR SALES ME IN TRAINING...

I was referred to Rusty and Roderic from a friend. They are not only extremely quick, but incredibly reasonable. I had to repeat the quote to make sure I had it correctly. Love the family business. I would recommend these guys to anyone in a heart beat!!
