I have been coming here for a few years now and it is a great place to grab some quality Mexican food, and for the price, you can't beat it! I recommend the rolled tacos w/ guacamole or any of the breakfast burritos.

Not to much to say about this place. It's pretty much what you expect from a chain hotdog joint. I paid 5.32 for a hot dog and a drink...I would rather spend 5 bucks at Safeway on a pack of 6 and cook them myself than eat here again. But I guess its a nice alternative to McDonalds..
