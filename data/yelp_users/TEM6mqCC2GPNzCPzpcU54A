Go here!!!  Excellent hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.  I've lived in Phoenix for eight years and love Mexican and this is now my favorite option for cheap and tasty Mex.    The meats are at the core of what makes this place special.  They have unique marinades and they cook their meats just right.  The carne asada and carnitas are the showstoppers.    It seems like there's just a little twist to everything they do, like using red onions with the carne asada--atypical, but what a great combo.  They have special salsas for each dish, and you generally don't need to add anything, as the food is packed with balanced flavors.  The burritos and tacos are kick-ass, and the horchata is awesome.  Don't miss this place.

Crackers & Co is a 4.5 only if we're on a 10-point scale.  I went with a party of four and we were all very underwhelmed with the slop served here.  Maybe we went on a bad day, but our disappointment went as far as the quality of the ingredients, which isn't something that typically varies on a day-to-day basis.    Now, TC Eggington's is a decent breakfast spot.  I can go there and count on a nicely prepared eggs benedict dish every time.  Crackers is not the type of place that would be capable of making a decent Hollandaise or even poaching an egg properly.   I wouldn't be quite so hard on this place if their rating wasn't so outrageous.  I want to help others avoid going here with high hopes of an outstanding breakfast and come away with a belly full of unmemorable food.  What has happened to our standards for a good traditional American breakfast?

Most menu items are exceptional while a few are more average.  Pizza, breakfast plates, salads and coffee bar are exceptional.  I've found many of the baked goods to be less moist than I like, such as the cinnamon rolls, bread pudding, and cakes.  Once you find your favorites though, you'll have plenty of reason to come back again and again.  Liberty Market offers a lot more than quality dishes though.  The atmosphere is unique and inviting.  It's a cool meet up place for groups, whether that be family, friends or colleagues.   Additionally, the service is always excellent.  It's a very tightly run operation in many ways, which makes it a 5 for me.  It has really enhanced the look and value of the Heritage District in Gilbert.

My wife is Peruvian, so we were both very excited to try a new South American restaurant.  The place is very small, with just about six tables, but they are also short-handed on staff--be prepared for slow service and excellent food.  The menu is primarily Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Colombian, but is peppered with dishes from other nearby countries such as Argentina.  We tried several traditional dishes, including churrasco (steak w/ eggs, fries, plantains, and rice), ceviche de pescado, empanada de pollo (chicken pastry), sango de camarones (shrimp in a peanut soup), and chicha morada (refreshing Peruvian purple corn drink).  Everything was expertly prepared and came out piping hot from the kitchen.  It felt like a home-cooked meal.  There aren't many non-Brazilian South American restaurants around, which makes Mi Comida that much more valuable.  It's on par with Contigo Peru in Mesa, which is another one I'd highly recommend.  Mi Comida has character, serving up authentic traditional dishes the way they're done back home in a cozy atmosphere.  It is not to be missed.  Call ahead to ensure they're open--they have odd business hours that tend to change.

I've only been here once, but I have to give it a 5--this was easily the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten.  Every aspect of it was perfect, from the freshly made bread that was crisp on the outer layer and chewy inside, to the wonderfully sauteed peppers and onions, it was mouth-watering just to gaze upon.  They use white American, which is a requirement to me for a good cheesesteak (don't come at me with this provolone stuff, not on a cheesesteak).  All this goodness for $5.  How can you beat that??  I also picked up some great quality ingredients for my next homemade pizza while I was there--San Marzano tomatoes, imported pepperoni from Chicago, and some cherry peppers.

This is a really solid Irish pub/restaurant.  The food is quite good, especially the Guinness braised beef boxty.  For dessert, be sure to try the bread pudding, which is probably the best I've ever had.    It's a fun place when it's busy and has a great traditional Irish pub feel inside.  They pour a perfect pint; you'll notice the difference if you're a Guinness lover.  Rula Bula is a little pricey, which is the pretty much the only reason I haven't rated it a 5.

Excellent Persian cuisine!  From the tender, tasty and juicy flame broiled chicken to the creamy, sweet and aromatic Persian ice cream (homemade with rose water, pistachio pieces, and honey), this place does it right.  No complaints whatsoever, including the service, which others have had concerns about.    Other dishes we tried included the lamb shank with basmati mixed with lima beans and dill weed and tadig (crispy rice) topped with sabzi (green vegetable and dried lime beef stew).  We got adventurous and tried the yogurt soda as well.  Everyone agreed this was a 5-star experience.

Incredible food and consistency.  The swordfish tacos are to die for.  Probably the most deserving 5-star rating in Phoenix.  Their prices are very reasonable considering the quality of ingredients and preparation.  Very nice atmosphere, too.

Great place for a breakfast burrito or other Mexican fast food.  They take their time preparing your order, and customize it to your delight (without charging extra for anything).  Great value for the quality and experience--it's always an inviting and fun place to visit.

My wife and I tried the new breakfast menu this morning.  We both really enjoyed it, especially the Mother Lode Burrito with milk gravy and the Raspberry Bread Pudding.  I have to say they really know how to make milk gravy; most restaurants and even home cooks have no clue as to what good milk gravy is, so I was impressed.  One thing they are going to struggle with a bit is that scrambled eggs will never be excellent when they're served cafeteria style.  The same goes for potatoes.  That's the primary reason our breakfast was very good, but not exceptional.  I understand this isn't something they can really change, but thought it was worth sharing the observation as eggs are key to most breakfast dishes.     Overall, the new breakfast is very tasty and well concieved.  We'll be back again in the near future I'm sure!  BTW, the 25 cent coffee is a nice throwback.  If you want a refill you just drop a quarter in the pink piggy bank on the honor system--pretty cool.

These guys do a lot of things right--from their perfectly marinated and grilled kabobs, to their unique and addicting Greek fries, to the delicate and scrumptious almond chocolate baklava--there are so many reasons to frequent Phoenicia.  Their service is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean.  This is one of my favorite places in Gilbert.

Excellent Thai food, likely the best in the east valley.  Yupha's Fried Rice is their standout dish for me, but all parts of the menu have been enjoyable.  Some folks have rated Yupha's low due to the owner's attitude.  Running a restaurant has to be one of the most difficult things to do--I say cut her some slack.  Anyway, I go for the food, not the service.

"Common food done uncommonly well" is their motto, and I think it fits perfectly.  You'll find a lot of typical American fare, but each prepared with a special twist, such as the buttermilk pancakes with applewood-smoked bacon and bleu cheese.  You'll also find many unique menu items such as the Fontina burger, which is made with roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto and Fontina cheese.  Whatever you decide on, you can be sure it will be expertly prepared and very tasty.  Some of my favorites are the breakfast tacos, BBQ chicken pizza, onion rings, sweet potato fries, any of the salads, and the malts.    Some other really cool things to note about Joe's Farm Grill are that much of the produce is grown in Agritopia right next to the restaurant.  You'll find many seasonal items are from the farm as well.  Also, the building itself was the home that Joe Johnston grew up in.  It has been remodeled quite a bit, but the original walls and even fireplace remain.  If you've never been, you must give it a try!

Imagine Chipotle with more flavor.  It's almost a complete ripoff of Chipotle's concept, but with the welcome twist of more interesting meat, sauce, and cheese options.    I'm not big on 2lb. burritos, so I wouldn't frequent Qdoba, but it's certainly worth a visit every once in a while.

I went here once several years ago and wasn't impressed, but recently I've recently gone back and I've been extremely impressed with the overall experience. I understand there was a change in management some time ago, and they are clearly doing things right.  I've been back three times recently and each time my family all agreed it was excellent.    I have dined at all the Thai Basil locations multiple times and feel that when you're craving Thai food, each of these restaurants is a consistent and reliable option.  Based on my recent experiences with this Chandler location, I have to say it is the best of all the Thai Basil restaurants in the valley.  BTW, I saw someone gave a one-star rating after trying their panang curry.  I had it recently and there is no way any reasonable person could offer such a rating.  I'm a curry-loving person, and it was up there with my favorite curry dishes I've ever had.  Even if the person didn't like the particular way the sauce was prepared, everything they serve is made with a great deal of care and always with fresh ingredients--there's no way you can call it "vile" and give the restaurant one star.  That's simply ridiculous.

Great little family-run Thai joint.  Very small inside, but nicely decorated.  The food is prepared with a lot of care and the ingredients are very fresh.  The Thai Fried Rice is excellent, as are most all the dishes.  Beware of the spiciness--medium here is like hot at other Thai joints.    My wife and I will be regulars.

Dutch Bros is great for coffee on the go.  The joe is good and their customer service is always extremely efficient and friendly.  I really enjoy their Irish cream coffee, either hot or cold.  Make sure to go on Tuesdays to get a double stamp on your Dutch Bros card!  Also keep an eye out for their Twitter specials.

Some of the dishes at Pho Van are so good I pretty much just inhale them.  The noodle bowls are wonderful, filled with fresh ingredients, a rich mixture of flavors and variety of textures.  The food is healthy and very tasty.      They have some exotic drinks on the menu.  My favorite is the lychee drink, which is essentially 10 or so fresh lychees in water with crushed ice.  It's very refreshing.  I will also note that the restaurant is conveniently located next to Gelato 64, so it's always nice to walk next door and have a little sorbet or ice cream to cap things off!

Best tacos I've ever had, hands down.  Also the smallest, but that's okay because they were so damn good.  They were perfect.  The Mission does a wonderful job of combining various Latin cultures' cuisine into a dish to make it their own.  I got the chicken tacos, which sounds boring, but they were extraordinary.  They are served with an aji amarillo sauce.  Aji is a common Peruvian pepper, which has a wonderful and unique flavor, but I've never seen it on tacos before, since tacos aren't part of Peru's cuisine.  That's what I love about this place--they married the Mexican and Peruvian cultures and made something delightful out of the union.    I can't wait for an opportunity to go back and try their arepas.  The pabellon has my mouth watering already!

I've been to GB many times and nearly always have a good experience.  They have quite a solid menu all around.  I really enjoy their SW eggrolls, garlic fries, burgers, chicken pesto pasta, pizzas, and steaks.  The deserts are very delicious.  Portions are typically pretty generous and quality is consistently good.  If you want to go for a beer and appetizer, GB is a really good choice as well.  Their brews are good, they have a lot of happy hour specials to choose from, and the bar area has a good ambiance.  They always have good tunes playing and several HD screens with various sports on.  This is one of my favorite chain restaurants.

I had two very bad experiences with the staff and policies at Mountainside in Gilbert.  I'm truly not over-exaggerating with the 1-star rating--I would never recommend to anyone to get a membership here.  To be fair, the fitness center is very nice inside and well laid out.  However, my experience is that they run an unethical business.  My initial meeting with a trainer was a huge sales pitch.  He told me if I wasn't motivated to get down to 7% body fat that I shouldn't come back to the gym, which was quite a shocking statement.  Apparently, he was gambling that he could pressure me into signing up with a personal trainer.  He thought wrong.  That experience was bad, but to me it was excusable as it was just one representative.  The inexcusable part is their cancellation policy.  They make you pay up front for the first month and last month, which is fine.  However, I went in to cancel my membership by chance on the first day of a month and they told me I could use the gym until the end of the next month.  I wanted to cancel that day not two months later.  They said since it was the first day of the month that they had already charged my card and that the next month was covered by my initial deposit for "last month" when joining.  To me that is simply and clearly an unethical policy that is unfair to the consumer.  The fact that they wouldn't prorate the current month was bad enough, but to keep the deposit for the following month was the straw on the camel's back for me.  They absolutely should have refunded one of the months.  If they were ethical and honest, this would be a wonderful gym.  Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that they are far from it.

Great place to hang out and have a specialty coffee, tea or breakfast snack.  You'll be surprised upon entering for the first time how nicely furnished it is inside.    I got a mint mocha iced coffee and a strawberry doughnut the other day and both were excellent.  Prior experiences were good as well.

Unfortunately, it appears Cherubini has shut down.  It's a shame, but I can't say I'm too surprised.  It looked like they had a lot of overhead and not enough volume to support it.  I guess I'll have to start hitting Dutch Bros. more often to get my fix!

What a great find this was.  Sleepy Dog just opened around the beginning of 2010.  They do what they know; they don't serve food, just beer, and the beers are very good.  The IPA, milk stout, and Scottish ale all stood out for me.  If you go during happy hour, the pints are $1 off, which makes the stout only $3/pint; that's hard to beat for a good microbrew stout.   It's a great place to hang out.  They have various seating arrangements inside, including couches.  It's a very comfortable setting to kick back and enjoy a brew and conversation.  They have four or five flat screen TVs with movies/sports playing, and also have several games you can take back to your table.    While they don't serve food, they welcome you to order food and have it delivered, or bring your own food.  They also will give you complementary bar snacks if you ask.  Plus, they have a popcorn machine that you can always help yourself to.  If you work or live near this area, I highly recommend giving it a try.  There's nothing not to like about this place.

I generally avoid Filiberto's unless I've run out of other options, and even then I stick to one or two things on the menu.  They can't mess up a basic breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes and cheese.  Well, I say that and the potatoes are always undercooked so they're crunchy from the rawness.  They make a decent AZ burrito, but it's greasy as all get out--you'll want to pour out the grease before consuming the last bit of the burrito.    Because it's so close to the house, I've been here at least 30 times, so I have a fully-formed opinion.  I used to be excited about them when they first opened--who wouldn't be excited about 24-hour Mexican right on your corner?  Over the years I've become turned-off by their cheap meats, overly greasy food, and inability to cook potatoes.    A better option for a cheap burrito in the area would be Los Favoritos in Chandler or Some Burros.

Some Burros is hard to beat for cheap and unhealthy Mexican.  Even a place like Filiberto's that competes strictly on price is an afterthought for me.  I can go to Some Burros for almost the same price, and while the portions are smaller than Fili, you actually get decent food.    I really like the red burro with beans.  The lean beef chunks are stewed until they are fork-tender.  I also really like the beef and potato tacos, which is a combo that can be hard to find.  They have a lot of tasty options on the menu to keep you coming back.  However, I try not to eat here more than once a month or so, as it's carb and fat overload to eat at a place like this often.

Excellent cupcakes as you'd expect at nearly $4 per.  They have quite a few mouth-watering options.  We chose strawberry and orange blossom (the chocolatey ones were calling our names, but we were in the mood for something lighter).  The cake was light and very moist, and the buttercream icing was some of the best I've ever tasted.  Service was friendly.  I'd go back on special occasions.

Inka Fest just opened in Dec 2010.  The food is very authentic with quality quite similar to Contigo Peru just a mile away; however, Inka Fest prices are a bit more competitive.  Atmosphere is also better, as they had a live satellite feed of Peruvian television, which was pretty cool.    They need to get some signage up quick, as there's nothing to distinguish the suite as a restaurant, let alone a Peruvian restaurant.  I'm sure they're working on it.    It's nice to have another option for Peruvian in town.  I'll certainly be back.

Pretty bad stuff--greasy, poorly prepped, unauthentic food.  I had the shrimp and veggie tempura.  There was a carrot an inch thick in the tempura that chewed like a tree branch...then it just slid completely out of the horrible tempura shell.  The rest was saturated with oil and not enjoyable.  They use fresh produce, but put no effort or thought into prep and execution.  They need experience and leadership in the kitchen.  On the positive side, the staff were friendly and the place was clean.

One of the better BBQ joints I've found in Phoenix so far--notably better than Joe's Real BBQ, which I'm a big fan of.  All of their meats are quality cuts smoked nicely.  I can't stop ordering the spicy chop!

Exceeded my expectations for a place that is essentially the Chipotle of pizza.  The pie was excellent all around.  I loved the crust, they use quality toppings, and it was cooked just right.  Can't wait to go back for more!
