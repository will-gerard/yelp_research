Chico's is delicious and in a convenient location! It's by no means gourmet. But hey, if you're in the area and looking for some decent food at a reasonable price, Chico's is the place.  I come here every Tuesday during my class breaks at ASU's downtown campus. I recommend the chicken taco salad :) The shell is crispy and light, filled with creamy refried beans, grilled chicken (sometimes a little too blackened for my taste), lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. They also have a wide variety of fresh salsas at their salsa bar!

We had artificial grass installed in July this year. I feel that Legacy Green did a quick job with the installation at a great price. The grass also looks amazing.  The problem I have is this:  I have 4 dogs (2 large yellow labradors and 2 chihuahuas). I was initially concerned about the dogs doing their business on the grass due to smell, but was assured that artificial grass is great for dog runs and that the dogs can do their business on the grass without a problem. THIS IS A COMPLETE LIE. My yard smells like piss, especially in the mid-afternoon with the sun beating down on it. I've tried all sorts of bio-enzymatic cleaners to counteract the pee smell, but the smell returns a couple days later.  I wish that the company had been more honest about the grass as it relates to pets. If I had known what a hassle this would have been, I would have opted to get regular grass installed. Sure, it looks pretty... But no one wants to BBQ outside with the smell of piss surrounding you.

This location is completely hit or miss. Both food and service are extremely inconsistent compared to other locations.   We have dined here multiple times, one being last night (6/30/2016) about 90 minutes before closing. My husband ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and was served the Chicken Carbonara. He received the correct dish after I finished eating. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles, which were over-fried. The mashed potatoes were reheated so badly that they were glued to the plate. At that point, I didn't even have the energy to complain about my meal since we already had to send my husband's order back since it was incorrect.   I love the Cheesecake Factory and will definitely return to other locations, but this one is comparable to a glorified Chili's.  UPDATE 7/29 (over a month later): I have reached out to this location twice regarding this recent visit and haven't gotten a response.

All I'm going to say about this place is that I've seen the workers multiple times in the trash area at Kierland Commons storing/preparing food back there. Items included lettuce heads, breads, and macaroni and cheese.   DISGUSTING. I'm not making this up.    Unfortunately, I contacted Health Services about this, and when someone came to inspect the trash area there was no food back there.  (I, along with co-workers, noticed this on the daily back in high school when I worked at Cold Stone).

Kelly did my hair for the first time at Choppers today and I loved it! He's a fun guy with a super cool shop. Very hip and laid back, which isn't something you'd usually expect in Scottsdale.  He did a really amazing job fixing my hair from a previous hair cut disaster and my color looks awesome! I've found my new favorite salon! Everyone should go here... And I want to try their new blow dry bar!!! :)

Pretty good for a nail place in a mall :)   They did my calluses really well. The reason for a 4 star is because they don't carry a lot of OPI products, which is unfortunate. Also, they said they give a 10 minute massage with each pedicure... I would be lying if I said it was even 5.

I came in today for a manicure/pedicure. The pedicure was okay--- the lady who did my nails messed up my big toe nail polish when she was putting on my sandal and tried to cover it up by filling in the crack with polish. It didn't look good and I had to ask her to redo it over again.   My manicure was horrible. Upon the drive home, I noticed that the sides of my nails weren't even painted. Also, some of the tips of the nail were unevenly coated/not coated at all. I had to try to match a color when I got home to fix it and became upset.   I called back asking for a refund ($15) for the manicure only. The manager refused, despite me threatening to file a dispute. I am now forced to dispute the charge. He offered for me to come back in and have them redone. I was just sitting there for 2 hours and I don't have time to drive back there. Also, I'm leaving for Alaska tomorrow and have other more important things to do (ie. pack, pick up prescriptions, etc.).    I will not be going back, and I will tell my friends to do the same.

Dr. Aaron Davis is the best doctor I've ever had. He's a really nice guy and cares about his patients, not just the money he makes.   I have severe allergies. When they poke your back with 50 testers, I was allergic to 47 of the triggers. Dr. Davis explained my conditions and gave me suggestions on how to avoid my triggers. He also placed me on a medication regimen and allergy shots. I've never felt better. I now own three dogs, which would not be possible without Dr. Davis.   I would also like to mention that I lost my insurance for a few months when I turned 22. During those four months, Dr. Davis provided me with all of the medications I needed free of charge.   He's awesome!

Very happy with the new shutters we purchased for our new home!  We called to schedule an appraisal and they were able to stop by our house and measure before it was even done being built. Shutters went into production and were finished within 4 weeks, just about a week after our house closed.  The appraisal and installation were great. The prices were very reasonable, especially in comparison to other suppliers in the valley. All our windows (18 total) cost $5,000 (which I was surprised by, as some of our windows are fairly large).  The only downside is the time it takes to install... The installer was here from 8am until about 7pm the same day. I would imagine any shutter installation would be time consuming, however.

This is by far my favorite sushi place in the valley. You get to grub on DELICIOUS sushi while also people watching (mostly middle-aged folk, cougars mostly, going through what seems to be a mid-life crisis).   The service is always superb. I never need to ask for a refill or have someone clear the plates. They got their shit together there.   The Yummy Yummy Roll is my absolute fave ($12). It's basically a shrimp tempura roll topped with spicy tuna, spicy mayo, and a dab of siracha. Try it and you'll be addicted.  The teppanyaki rocks too! Be sure to go during happy hour. You get reduced pricing at the teppanyaki tables and you still get a ton of food.

I'm not quite sure where all the rave reviews come from for Joe's BBQ... I've been two times with different people and no one would come back. The meat is ok... Sides horrendous. Arizona clearly doesn't know what good barbecue is, because if you compare this crap to Kansas City barbecue, it's pathetic.   If cafeteria style, bland ass, if-I-had-to-imagine-what-prison-food-tasted-like-food seems appealing to you, try this joint.

This is the worst Chipotle location ever.   Lines are always out the door... And I've never seen a line move so slow in my life. No joke, plan to wait around 30 minutes. There are 3 reasons for this:  1. The employees are slow... And don't listen. I can't tell you how many times I've either had to have them remake my order entirely due to a lack of communication or add sides because they only put on a teaspoon of hot sauce.  2. Not sure why people don't use the online ordering. In the land of Mormons (aka Gilbert), this would really make a difference in the line... One person will be ahead of you placing 10 orders they are reading off their phone.   3. Samples. "Can I try the chicken?" Who the hell needs to sample chicken?! I mean really, people. Get yourselves together.   You're much better off going to the Chipotle location on Gilbert between Ray and Warner.

You really can't beat a $20 gel manicure. With that being said, Holly is the best. I can't vouch for anyone else. She spends a lot of time perfecting the cuticles and polishing the nails so they look fab :)   I think their gel polish selections are lacking, specifically OPI. They should really increase their shades, particularly seasonal colors.   Also, I've called ahead for appointments and still end up waiting upwards of 20-30 minutes. They shouldn't take appointments if they can't be timely.

Sake Bomber is too legit to quit.  The pricing is reasonable and they serve large, delicious rolls. The location is kinda sketch and it looks like the building is possibly abandoned. But, it cranks out those bad boy rolls like you wouldn't believe.   Try the Tasty Tuna, it's awesome! It's basically a shrimp tempura roll, topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. Mmmmm. Goodness I'm craving one now! The shrimp tempura, Boston roll, and tootsie maki also do not disappoint. I'm sure everything on their menu is decent.  I give them kudos too for always making a special, made-to-order roll for my boyfriend and I every time we come in. Try it--- it's made with rice, fried calamari, cream cheese, and topped with eel sauce and tempura flakes. :)

I don't understand the infatuation with this place. Maybe I ordered the wrong rolls?  My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday evening. We both got the all you can eat special ($20/each). The edamame was cold and not salted... I've never seen that. It's free and all, but I'll pass on that if I ever come back. The miso was okay, nothing special, and the salad was lacking. Luke warm, limp lettuce topped with a flavorless ginger dressing. It's only saving grace was the tiny, yet delicious, piece of crab on top.   The sushi was mediocre and definitely not something to write home about. The only roll worth mentioning was the Mido Roll, which was rather delicious.   I won't be back, even if the prices are temping. Check out Sapporo in North Scottsdale. It's got the best sushi in the valley.

Tasty and fresh sushi right on the Chandler-Gilbert border.   The rolls I suggest that are bomb.com include:  Las Vegas Roll: Cream cheese, eel, avocado, crab and shrimp... Deep fried. Need I say more? A few dunks of soy sauce and this baby is delish.  Dragon Roll: Crab, cucumber, eel, and avocado. Just the right amount of freshness.  You also can't go wrong with the ASU roll, Crazy Shrimp roll, or the Ladybug. The sashimi I've had here has been great, too.   Don't forget to pull up their e-coupon on your smartphone! $3 off your order of $20 or more, or $7 off an order of $45 or more. :)

They are lucky to get 2 stars from me.  Not sure why this place has such stellar reviews. I'll keep it simple.  1. No refills on drinks the entire dinner. 2. Only beef was good. Chicken, pork, riblets, and lamb were all dry as a bone. 3. The salad bar left a lot to be desired in my opinion. They had some good, unique choices and displays, but they should also offer traditional salad options.   We spent $50 each, had a reservation at 6pm and left at 645pm. That says something. You are much better off going to a real steakhouse like Mastro's City Hall or Ruth's Chris. At least their meats are worth the price.

This is a great path for any activity- running, walking, biking. I used this during my marathon training 5 times a week last year. While I would not consider it a trail in the traditional sense, it's a great paved route along the eastern side of the canal. The western side of the canal is unpaved in areas. There's also plenty of fish, turtles, and ducks to see. I especially love running past the llamas (between Pecos and 202) and the cows (between Germann and Queen Creek).

I love this place! I get the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and tater tots every time... The perfect heart attack recipe :)  The pulled pork sandwich is delicious! I crave it. It's moist with just the right amount of BBQ. One time the meat was fatty and chewy, but they redeemed themselves. The sides are good, nothing special.  It's good comfort food. If your looking for something healthy and fancy, you won't find it here. There is service in the bar, otherwise you have to go to the counter to order, pick up your order, and refill your drinks. I've probably gained five pounds from this place.

My boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves from our low carb diet and go to Scooptacular. Let's just say it was well worth it!  The place is nicely decorated and new looking (I'm not sure how long this place has been here, as we are new to the area). The owner was very helpful and gave/offered us as many samples as we wanted. We were really impressed by their selection of flavors. They have all the classics, along with some creative and different concoctions.   I went with two classic choices--- cookies and cream and chocolate, while my boyfriend opted for the cookie monster and reese's peanut butter cup. Every ice cream we tried was absolutely delicious. You can tell that they are passionate about making high-quality, delicious ice cream. It's nice since there are so many chains out there. It's also good to support a well-run, original local business.  I also wanted to say that the owner let us use the Yelp check-in offer (one free waffle cone), even though the coupon expired over a month ago.   We will definitely be back, although not as much as I would like in the near future, since I need to drop about 30 pounds.

Wow, all I can say is this place SUCKS big balls.  Take your money to 24 Hour Fitness (which is literally 3 minutes from here), where your business will be appreciated.   My boyfriend and I joined back in early summer. We paid for 2 full-year memberships. We paid nearly $500 each, which I feel is high for a gym. Don't go here if you are interested in a serious workout... All the women come all dolled up. And all the guys are meatheads (especially the trainers, who need to really lay off the roids).     The gym is very nice... clean, good/new equipment. The reason for the 1 star, however, is due to their policies and lack of customer service. When joining, they rush you through the contract to get you to sign, skipping over the fact that you are responsible for inquiring any additional fees that they deem as necessary. So, after my boyfriend and I had been working out at this location for a month, we got a bill in the mail saying we owed an additional $52 for their renovations. EXCUSE ME!?! This gym is like 5 years old...   When I called to ask what specifically the charges were for, the manager told me it was for the new IMAX Theater, valet parking.... the list goes on. Are you serious!? Valet parking at a gym? I've never heard of something so absurd. Get exercise and walk to your own car... This is a gym for goodness sakes!  They refused to take the charges off my bill even though I would never use their useless new amenities. They said if the charges weren't paid by the due date, I wouldn't be able to work out until they were paid off (with late fees). HAHAHA. So I went to Craigslist, sold both my memberships and my 20 personal training sessions. And I didn't have to pay their outrageous fees.   There were other shortcomings, but honestly, my BP is already going through the roof from writing this review. I'm done. You can go fuck yourself Mountainside Fitness!!

I'm probably stating what's already been said here, but please... When I'm paying nearly $20 for a car wash, I expect it to be at least mediocre, if not good.   This place blows. Water spots all over the glass, carpets barely vacuumed, and literally no dust or wipe downs on the inside whatsoever.   I've come twice, won't be coming again. I shouldn't have to whip out the vacuum and Windex as soon as I pull into my garage to clean it myself. I have enough shiz to clean, yo.

Stand Up Live has potential. It's nice, comfortable, and a new venue. However, it's extremely over priced. You have to order two drinks minimum per person. My boyfriend and I are on diets, so we opted for bottled water. We were in shock when the bill came... $24.83 for 4 bottles of SPARKLETS water. If you're going to charge those prices for water, at least make it Voss or Evian. WTF?!   After the show we walked by CVS who had 20 bottles of Arrowhead water on sale for $2.66. Wow.   I'm all for supporting local businesses, but I really feel like I was bent over and done dry.

Kevin did a great job with our home inspection in January 2015. Our one year home warranty was fast approaching with Meritage Homes and we needed peace of mind going forward that our house was okay since we had so many issues.   Kevin spent about 3 hours total looking over the house and provided a detailed inspection report the night of the inspection via email (pictures included!). He even came back this month (March) to ensure the repairs were completed satisfactorily and provided another re-inspection report--- completely free of charge!  I will use Kevin again and I've already recommended him to family members who need their home inspected soon as well. He's the best!

Robert is awesome!  I called to schedule an appointment. We discussed how I was concerned about all of the stains my pets have left on our carpets from vomit, pee, and poop... You name it.  Robert came to the house on time and got started. He used a "water claw" on our carpets in the tough to clean areas. He soaked the urine spots and then sucked up the water with this device. The result was amazing! 1 year old stains were gone... And are still looking great over a week later.   We also had our tile done. The grout is the cleanest it's been since we moved in.   We will definitely be using Robert again. His prices our reasonable and he cares about the job he does. He does all of the jobs himself and calls back a few days later to make sure you are 100% happy with the work. Otherwise, he will come back and fix it at no charge.

This gym is awesome. We've been members for 2 years and only pay $15/month each. Our first year was a discounted rate of $10/month.  The gym gets pretty busy during the week days after people get off work. Thankfully, I've never had a problem finding a treadmill or waiting to use any of the other equipment.   The only gripe I have is that many of the televisions on the treadmills don't work. Additionally, there is a time limit of 60 minutes on the treadmills before they automatically shut off. This was a problem when I was training for my marathon. If these two issues were fixed, I would bump my rating up to 5 stars.

We are so happy with the tv stand we purchased for our home theater. David was super helpful throughout the buying process and was willing to negotiate prices fairly. We ended up paying $375 for the tv stand (originally $499) with a $30 delivery fee.   The piece looks great and is of high quality! We will definitely be back! :)

So. Good.   Cinnamon ice cream = da bomb. So happy to have found a place that carries it even when it isn't the holiday season. The Moose Tracks and Mint Chocolate Chip were great, too!   The line was a little slow, but they are still trying to find their rhythm after the recent opening.   Will definitely be back to give the other favors a try!

This place is very tasty and has an expansive breakfast menu.   The buttermilk pancakes are huge, tasty, and super light and fluffy. The green chile skillet is delicious as well! It's served in a cute bowl, layered with potatoes, shredded carnitas, green chili sauce, eggs cooked to order, and cheese with a tortilla on the side.   The only negative thing I have to mention is how long the wait is on weekends, especially in regards to how long the food takes to come out once you order. Slow. Slow. SLOW.
