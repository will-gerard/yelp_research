I will be the first one to admit that this place would have gotten 5 stars when I first went there 7 years ago.  I went there with a bunch of other Yelpers Thursday...so there were about 20 of us...so this is going to be more about the food then anything else.  I am not going to rate the service, though our waiter, Guy, did a good job considering the large group.  Really couldn't complain about that.  I wasn't a big fan of the wine...but that definitely could have been my fault.  (I have been told in the past that my taste in wine can be better)   Sarah G and I shared the Calamari...which I thought was very full of flavor and cook just right.  The Potato soup was ok...a little too watery for my taste.  I loved the salad especially the house dressing.  I think that was the best part of the meal.  Of course by the time I got my main course, I was full.  But I did eat all of my veggies and half of my chicken (which said it came with lemon butter sauce...but that sauce was not lemony and it had mushrooms on it...which this chicken dish was not supposed to have...oh well.)  I did try Gabi's Sea Bass...now that was yummy!  5 stars though for the awesome company!!!!

I used to be scared...I used to be petrified.  I was never one to branch out with my variety of cuisine, which meant that I never had Indian food before...until a couple of months ago when I was invited to a dinner party. And at Flavors of India...my Indian Food cherry was broken.  I decided to review this place now...since I have experienced other restaurants since.  I tend to always come back to this location.  The place seems very clean, I love the Bollywood videos that they play, and I love the service.  And I think that they have the best buffet!    Now, I am really bad at names of the food that I order there (which is why I end up at the buffet...I may not know the names, but I know what I like looks like)  See me there at lunch real soon :)

Ok, I am not one that knows her sushi well, but when I order a roll that said that is comes with crab, cream cheese, cucumber, and avocado, why am I getting a roll with just whitefish?  I have been here twice and each time I have had the worst service!  This time around was the most interesting.  Twice, bussers came to our table and just tried to take our chairs.  Did they ask? NO.  Did they notice that my friend's purse was on one of them?  NO.  Did they ever come back when we said that we actually needed one more chair? NO.    Also, when it was time to pay the bill...all of us (6 people total) decided to make the server's job easier by writing on the back of the check on how much each of us was going to pay.  My one friend wrote $40 and I wrote $15 (I didn't eat much and I didn't get anything to drink)  This was with tip included.  Server comes back and charges my friend $15 and me $21.98.  (HUH!)  Then she told us that she couldn't add the tip with it.  Couldn't she have told us that first?  Especially when a sharp person could see that we were giving her way more than what the bill stated.  The food both times I was there was bleh.  Even the temperature of the food wasn't right.  I kept on thinking to myself this is how one gets food poisoned.  (I did not)  They turned off the heaters outside when there were still a bunch of people enjoying happy hour.  (It wasn't very warm out there!)    Next time...we are going to meet somewhere in Tempe for sushi happy hour.

My new home away from home.  As soon as I walk into Keegan's....the bar and waitstaff remember me and indulge in awesome conversation.  I always meet and have fun with the patrons as well.  It is like a family reunion....  And the food is amazing as well.  And please always remember to make room for their cobbler :)  Prices are very reasonable - and Happy Hour is a menu you can't beat.  (Football Sundays is also an all day happy hour as well)

After my Radio Milano experience, my friends and I decided to get a wine nightcap at Postino.  I was already tired, but still wanted to hang out.  This was my 2nd time at Postino (first time was for drinks and dinner)  We just wanted wine this time...we ordered 2 bottles.  (I sound like a lush)  The bar closed at 11pm, which I thought was odd...on a Saturday night I thought it should be later.  But the server said that enjoy all we want and we can order all we want until then.  They will so not kick us out.  I just love the atmosphere of this place.  I don't feel that I am in a pretentious crowd and the service is so on its mark.  There is a chance that I will be there for New Years...and if so...update!!!!

Words could not even express how angry I was after I left this place.  My friend and I went there to get pedicures done a couple of weeks back. (I knew if I wrote this review right away, it would have been right down nasty)  First off, we are told to sit in the chairs to soak our feet while waiting for a nail tech to assist us.  Jill got her lady first, and I am just sitting there....waiting....getting waterlogged.  Then I realize that this lady is going to do MY feet AFTER Jill's...even though there were other tech's available.  I look over at Jill while I am waiting and she is in pain.  She is not enjoying this one bit.  Now...here we go about my feet.  Now...not to be disgusting, but my feet get dry.  The tech offers to remove the dead skin from my heels and said she will give me the sponge as a gift.  Ummm...thanks!  No word on charging me...but what should I expect?  My massage was very short...and she also hurt my feet while clipping and filing.  She had no TLC in her what's so ever.  When she was scrubbing my feet she yelled at me..."Give me your hand...give me your hand...and feel!"  Lady, I know what my feet feel like thank you very much.  No need to remind me on how my feet are.  I already know.  So when we are going up to pay....she said that mine was $10 more than my friends....I am like...whatever.  Where is my spongey thing you promised. "I give!"  No lady, you didn't give.  "Oh, I will get it."  Yeah...thanks for it....from the effing garbage.  I will go back to my normal place....where they treat me nice (to my face) and give me TLC on my feet.

I would have never known that this place even existed if i wasn't invited out to breakfast this morning after my grueling (but so awesome) bike ride this morning.  It isn't the easiest place to find if you aren't looking for it.  Service was great...everybody was so helpful and friendly. (My cousin asked for her eggs a certain way and they came out watery...and were so pleasant to deal with when she needed them to take it back.) I loved the decor of the restaurant; I thought it was very cute.    The menu was so diverse, I didn't know what to get.  (I was tempted to get the chocolate chip pancakes that were only offered on the kiddie menu...but I knew better...)  I ended up getting the Spinach and Mushroom omelette that was also filled with cheese and bacon.  (I got it minus onions...yuck!  I am thinking about opening an onionless cafe...)  It was the first time I didn't have to put ketchup on my eggs. They were that good.  The potatoes were awesome.  I also opted for pancakes instead of toast...and that was the only thing that I was disappointed in.  (Sorry Sarah G...) They were hard!  A little too well done for my taste.  But I won't hold it against them.  I will definitely be back to try more breakfast and their yummy sounding desserts.

I am sad. Today was last day in a very long time I will be eating at Rubios. I am starting this ridiculous almost all protein diet, and sadly, Rubios just doesn't cut it.  With all of the sodium and carbs that this place carries...I just have to say goodbye for a little while. So, today (after working out no less...because I am an oxymoron) I decided to give my bon voyage of tasty mexican good to Rubios. Rubios I love you. You are my favorite. But I promise to see you soon :)  And I will get enchiladas again. Yummy.

Wow, I can't believe these negative reviews.  I went there last week for the first time and I have to say that I thought that it was wonderful.  Besides some service blunders I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. My mom never had Mexican food before (GASP!) except for the basic Taco and Taco Salads.  She ordered the enchildas as did I.  Their salsa was great.  I loved my green chile sauce that was on my enchiladas.  And I LOVED the Sangria.  I got a litre of Sangria for $9.95. Can't go wrong there. Of course it isn't considered "authentic" Mexican food.  Who cares!  It still tasted excellent.

Strange that I am writing a review on Nordstrom.  My mother and my sister both work at a Nordstrom (Mom is pacesetter at the one in Troy, MI and my sister is the manager of men's sportswear at the Novi, MI location) so I am extremely familiar with how Nordstrom's customer's service is supposed to be.  While my experience yesterday was mostly positive, there was one gripe that I have that I will tell about a little later.  So, I decided that I had to do a little makeover yesterday.  I was going out with girlfriends that night, and since I have been a little negative lately, I thought that buying a new outfit, makeup, and shoes would do the trick.  So, first I went to the MAC counter to see if I could book a makeover session...they took me right away which shocked the crap out of me.  The girl asked me what I wanted, and I just said (yes I did) I want to look friggin hot.  With only that information in mind, Patty did the most amazing job that anybody ever did on my face.  I literally felt better already.  (and yes, I bought the colors that she applied...)  Then, here comes my negative experience.  Now, I know that I do not look like the typical Nordstrom shopper, but I am not a raggy looking person either.  I went to the TBD dept looking for something that I knew that I would never wear normally.  There were about 5 girls working, just gossipping with each other, not paying me any mind.  At first I wasn't annoyed.  But when they would help others, that is when I became a little frusturated.  Then, which my two pairs of jeans and 4 shirts that I was holding felt a little heavy, I tried to get a girl's attention, only to be ignored.  I was amazed.  I even dropped a shirt (maybe on purpose) and I got nothing.  I had this one tall blonde staring at me but never came over.  Then some young girl walked in the dept. and she ran over to help her.  Maybe I was being a little irrational, but this is not the customer service that I ever experienced at a Nordstrom.  I finally went up to a girl and said as much and couldn't believe the experience I was having.  She was standing there in a state of shock, and I began to felt bad.  In the end, Crystal did a great job with helping me, and even picked out a couple of shirts that I would have never thought of buying before.    So, Nordstrom at Chandler Fashion Square was redeemed, though I personally like the one at Scottsdale a whole lot better.  I know that Nordstrom is now going with the smaller, two stories look for most of their stores now (the new one they are building in N Scottsdale will be like the one in Chandler) but I love the variety at Scottsdale a whole lot better.  And a shout out to Thea at Scottsdale, who literally does the best personal shopping ever over there.

Today was a day of relaxation, so what a better way to do that than is to get a massage!  I usually go to Dolce, but they were booked, so I tried Madison Avenue Salon and Spa inside Chandler Fashion Center.  I got my hair done there on Saturday and was already impressed.  (though I could have done without the receptionist.  At the end, I went up to pay my bill and she told me that she didn't like my hair - which I loved.  And I told her so, and she then said, "Oh I couldn't tell by the expression on your face, so I assumed you didn't like it.)  Okay.  I decided to get their Theraputic Massage (I am not a fan of Swedish)  The one thing that I like about Dolce is that they offer more of a variety of massage...(I especially love their Combination massage)  So, I had Brenda, and all I have to say is that she was wonderful.  In a strange way I felt like I was in physical therapy, but she is the first person to get my kinks out.  I literally left there feeling taller and straighter.  She gave me great tips on stretches that I could do at work and gave me a lesson on reflexology.  I give the place 4 stars, but I will say more towards 4.5 stars.  The only issue I had was their reception area and the fact that while Brenda was awesome, she did tend to talk too much during the massage.

I go here all the time...and the fire roasted tomato soup is the most amazing thing ever....and I hate soup.  Go figure.  Anywho, the funny thing that happened today made me realize just how ignorant some of the help could be.  I asked the girl at the counter what comes on the Chicken Artichoke Panini Sandwich and she looked at me strangely and said "chicken and artichokes."  Ok, duh!  Anything else?  Like cheese, tomato, dressing?  "Oh, let me ask."  So she asks the guy that makes the sandwiches what comes on it and he said, "um, I have no idea."  Are you kidding me?  So the manager finally came over and told me everything that was on the sandwich.  Thank you smart lady.   So, while the service is not the best...the sandwich was amazing.  And I always love my free cookie....

This was the cutest wine store!  I loved it.  I went there for an event, so I really was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere of the store.  (I thought it was going to be more of a restaurant...I obviously know NOTHING!)  The wine was great, the staff was very friendly, and I just thought the place was cute.  Cute Cute Cute.  I also love the t-shirts that were available for sale..."Women Taste Better"  I love it!

OK, I am definitely not the know it all when it comes to tattoos, but my friend told me about Wise Magic when I was decided to get my first tattoo.  I walked in their on a whim one day and I have to say that they did not make me feel stupid, though I definitely felt that way. I looked through the books to see if I liked anybodys art work. I was looking for somebody that was really good with color....and I noticed the Reverend Rad Chad's work. Ironically, it was the same guy that I was talking to when I came in.   I booked an appt that day for a couple weeks later. A few days before, I walked in (when I was supposed to be at a party...shameful I know) and decided right then and there I was going to get it done. I loved his design of my plethora of stars and how he did the coloring (all purple) and shading was amazing! It was a painless experience as well and I loved it that my tattoo didn't look all red and puffy when it was done.   I went to the party after and received compliments as well. ***Blush****   If and when I get tattoo #2 and #3...I am definitely going back there!

4.5 stars  Back in August, 2009...I decided that I wanted to get the Brazilian Keratin treatment done to my hair.  My hair looked horrible curly and I was ready to try something new.  Along with my curly hair, I also severely damaged my hair over the years with over processing my hair with color . My hair was also thin and dry.    I did some research and decided to give Bravo Salon a try.  They are known for doing exceptional service with the Brazilian Keratin, along with the Japanese.  I had my consultation with Elena, who recommended the Brazilian treatment for me.  Ever since then, I have been back numerous times for styling and color.  I love it that Elena is not scared to try new and daring ideas to my hair. She also listens and makes sure that I do not leave the salon looking less than perfect.  If she sees a hair out of place, or if a piece of hair was not dyed properly, she will make sure it is done perfectly before I leave.  She is a wonder with hair and also super sweet and personable.  Ever since I started the Brazilian Keratin process, my hair has been growing like a weed and is now soft and thicker.  I love it!  And what I love more is that Elena will not offer to do the Keratin in my hair again until I absolutely need it.  Usually the process washes out in 6-12 weeks.  I am now passed the 12 week mark and not even close of needing another application.  (This is not normal from what I understand...and this is from others that I know that get this process done)  I also see Elizabeth for my brow wax....I have to admit she does an exceptional job.  I am going to see her for a facial next week.    Prices are very reasonable...especailly for a salon in Scottsdale.   If I have to say anything negative, it has to be that I have to be in agreement about how small the place is.  I did mention this to the staff and they are fully aware.  Ideas are being thrown around to make that experience better.  In the end, I have to admit that I am very picky and choosy when it comes to my hair.  It took me three years and many different stylists and salons...but I now found my hair a home :-)

Ok I am poor...and Lifetime is the reason for it.  But you know what...I don't care...I heart LIfetime Fitness.  It is the only gym that I actually feel comfortable working out in.  They never tried to upsell me on packages.  My sales manager (who works in Scottsdale) is the best.  But on top of everything else...I love my trainer.  (this is why I am poor...but I love him so)  He is the best and believe me...when the manager was choosing a trainer for me...they knew what they were doing.   Matt is the best.  He is so worth it.  I am going to have my first experience with the classes tomorrow, and I have signed up for volleyball. (hint hint...they need more players)    The lifespa is awesome, and the Life Cafe has the best Chicken Pesto sandwich in the world.  Everybody is so friendly there...and the whole gym is extremely clean...another thing that I like.  I cannot complain in the least.

4.5 stars  Ok....I just had the most amazing facial there today....I never experienced anything like it.  And my pedicure rocked also.  I don't think I picked a better day to have a little relaxation.  I rode almost 24 miles today (I swear it was all uphill) and I had the worst pain in my legs.  (Yes, I did stretch)    My pedicure was great...Shannon does a wonderful job....though now I have straight line syndrome with french man/pedicures.  Since I hate it that they have to use latex gloves, I couldn't tell at all that she was wearing them when i was getting my massage.  AND!  She actually made my feet completely soft and dry skin free.  That alone is a miracle.    Then I had my amazing facial.  Where do you get a facial that they put your hands in parrafin wax, massage your legs (I did complain about my pain....) and give the most relaxing neck, shoulder, and head massage ever?????  Laura is amazing...and she does a great job with waxing also.    I found out today that you don't have to be a member of Lifetime Fitness to go there...and I did hear another rumor that rocks...but I don't know if I should say it here....

Ok, the last thing I wanted to do on my Thanksgiving visit to Phoenix, was to get new tires. I was driving from Denver when I noticed for the 2nd time in a week that my car was sounding funny since I got my oil change and tire rotation.  (Another review, which won't be five stars from the dealership will be forthcoming) I couldn't place it, but figured everything was fine.  (Known fact: I know nothing about cars)  During Thanksgiving, I had my friend's brother, who is a mechanic, drive with me to Starbucks so he can hear what I was hearing.  He got out of the car and vanished.  I am like, where did he go?  He was bent down looking at my tires.  My two front tires sidewalls were completely toast.    So, the next day I called my dealership on a price on my tires.  I got two tires from them last time and they matched Discount tires price.  This time, not so much, and they were going to charge me $350 for two tires.  I knew that was extremely high for my Nissan Sentra.  That is when I went to where I found amazing reviews for Big O Tires.  They priced out my tires, with the warranty, for $194 for two tires.  SAME TIRES that ABC Nissan were going to give me, btw.    The staff was extremely helpful and courteous.  Didn't treat me like a dumb blonde either, which I totally appreciated.

Ok, the first thing I am going to say is something positive...because I have been told to find the positive things in life...I focus too much on the negative.  Their cornbread was friggin amazing.  Whew, now I got that out of the way.  Now I can go on with my happy self and tell you why this place is lucky it is getting 2 stars  (and really it is only because my cousin had something nice to say also)  The story goes...I never experienced such horrible customer service in my life.  My cousin was in town from Michigan and loves the show "Drive-in's, Diners, and Dives" (is that the right order?)  and heard about this place so we just had to go.  (My grandparents mentions Bill Johnson's Big Apple, but I said I would just go home if they were going to go there.)  So Aaron and I ordered our entrees with a salad, and my grandfather order his entree with chili.  (Grandma doesn't eat much...)  Aaron also ordered fried dill pickles for an appetizer.  (Note: My grandma and I wanted a baked potato that on the menu said that are availabe after 5pm but the waitress said they wouldn't be ready until 5:30pm)  Aaron and I got our salads...and Aaron asked about the pickles..."Oh, they are cooking them now."  Ok...so then my grandpa asked for his chili, which should have came out with our salads, and the waitress replied "Listen, I have other tables that have orders also.".  Wow....I even replied, "Are you serious?"   So besides that, I found the decor a little nauseating (how many pink pigs do I need to see and why are they seriously playing "Babe" on the TV?  Like I want to eat pork now)  The food was so so...cousin said that his ribs were cooked just right, but the sauce was too sweet to his liking.  Grandparents thought that their sandwiches were too big.  I thought that my mashed potatoes had a funky flavor too them.  So with the review of the ribs and their awesome cornbread (which I ordered a 2nd helping of) I give it 2 stars.    Where oh where can I find some awesome barbeque????

Ok, going to make this short and sweet....  Awesome food and service.  The bar area even turned on the Red Wings game for my cousin so he could see the score.  Not quite Flemings (where I really wanted to go to) but still, for a chain restaurant, this place serves up some yummy steak. (and crab, and calamari, and salad, and shrimps, and asparagus)  Our server rocked and I am sure I will be back again.

Yes, I am not kidding you, this place dropped all the way to last place.  I heard that they are getting new management after the first of the year...lets hope that is true.  Because the HORRIBLE food that we received, I have no idea how this place will stay in business.  (Though, it looked like the place was crawling with Sun City folk- no disrespect of course, since I was there will my grandparents and their friends.)  Their vodka selection was slim.  My French Onion soup was disgusting.  My filet Oscar was DRENCHED in Bearnaise sauce...so much so I couldn't even eat it.  And because I was with my grandfather, he wouldn't let me take it back.  (Must be an old school thing.)  Nothing was cooked right (my grandmother and her friend disliked their salmon....though later on my grandmother said the food was so good there she can't wait for New Years...long story)  I mentioned that we should have went to Flemings...but nobody listened.

I was a little confused at what this place actually was at first when I walked in.  I went there to see my friend's friends band play last night.  I got that part.  But was it part art gallery, part coffee shop, part music venue, part lets confuse me a little more? It was a little strange to see a band perform there and no alcohol was served.  Thank G-d for the Bikini Lounge next door.    Whatever this place was, it was pretty cool!  The people that seemed to frequent the place seemed very nice and the chick that was working was super cool.  I actually could say that the acoustics in that place rocked....both bands that played sounded crystal clear and didn't blow my eardrums out.  Only real minus was the parking.  But who cares...it was one of the coolest places that I went to in Phoenix.

I am at work today, talking to my co-worker, letting her know that I was going to Taco Bell for lunch.  She looked at me disappointed, and said "I never want to hear that you are gaining weight again...stop eating that!"  She then told me about Sacks....I decided that I would give it a shot. (not that is was any healthier....) I wasn't real impressed with the layout of the place, even where it was located.  It was getting busy when I walked in...and had no idea what to order.  I ended up with the Van Gogh, which was roast beef, dill, alfalfa sprouts, cheese and I subsituted the marble rye for a tomato basil bread.  The girl at the counter was really sweet and helpful at helping me pick out what I wanted.   My sandwich was really good, and it wasn't just a normal sandwich.  I also liked the little cookie that they snuck into my bag.  And the fact that they have Stewart's root beer was a nice bonus. The only thing that I could say that was negative is that I left there still smelling the kitchen on my coat.  And it wasn't pleasant.

I was so pleasantly surprised with the Breakfast Club.   I wanted to take my mom to a nice brunch on a Monday...and I thought the Orange Table.  We walked in there and they stopped breakfast at 11, so I knew that I never went to the Breakfast Club before, but thought hey why not.  It was such a windy day when we went and the newspapers were flying everywhere on our table.  But we still enjoyed ourselves.  Service was wonderful; very attentive.   My mom loved her pancakes and I was so thrilled to find french toast made of challah!  (There is no other way to make french toast)  I also had hash browns (wanted the carbs I guess) and they were awesome as well.  The prices were a little bit high for breakfast food, but I have to remember that I am in Old Town Scottsdale.  I would love to go back there anytime. :)

I always wanted to try this place and today I finally did.  This is the best breakfast that I ever had in Phoenix!  I was extremely impressed of the service...when my breakfast companion and I walked through the door until we left, the servers made us feel welcome.  When the girl at the front told us that it would be a 15 minute wait (which was only 5) she actually asked if we wanted something to drink.  Everybody else also as attentive and very sweet.  I ended up with the Veggie Scramble with green chiles. It was delicious (I didn't even need ketchup!) and I even loved my sour dough toast. (And I never eat toast)  My companion had the White Flannel Corned Beef Hash.  She let me try it....this was the best thing that I ever tasted in my life!!!  I definitely know what I would be ordering next time.  We also split a banana pancake that was out of this world.   I was in heaven.  Next time the hash and a chocolate chip pancake.

I really do not have a lot of positive things to say about this bar.  I went there for an event last week with a friend of mine, and I was not impressed.  My friend and I were starving, so we went inside to find a place to sit.  The place smelled like garbage...I am not kidding.  My friend and I looked at each other and went back onto the patio, where we asked for white wine from one server.  (very nice, btw)  Then when she left, another server came up to us and asked us for our order.  I am not kidding you this happened three times.  So our nice server told us that they ran out of Chardonnay...which happened to be the only white wine they have.  They only had Merlot left.  We got our wine not in wine glasses...but small water glasses.  I know that red wine is supposed to warm (???) but this stuff was nasty.  Almost reminded me of Manischewitz.  We told her that this was not good wine and I asked for an iced tea.  S***  you not...they said that they do not brew iced tea on the weekdays.  I ended up with a water.  We then went to the event on the other side of the patio...not the best place to mingle...a little cramped and not easy to manuever yourself.  Nice server chick is the only reason why I give this place 2 stars. (I am being extremely nice here) I really do not know what this place tries to prove, especially being in Old Town...not a dive bar...I am not sure exactly what kind of bar it is trying to be to be honest.

I think the rule to actually like this pizza and actually want to eat it is to be drunk.  I was drunk and I loved the white pizza with spinach.  My friend had the cheese pizza...she didn't like it.  She was sober.

Hey, you know what?  I liked this place.   The DJ played cool music, when he wasn't trying to mix it with crap.  Servers were friendly, the atmosphere was cool.  And they gave out free shots.   Never should have left to go next door to Six.  I was happy sitting with the girls chatting it up at Mulligans.

I finally found my dive bar.  Right when I walked into the Coach House I could smell the diviness. An old pinball game, cheesy darts, cheap drinks, and rockin music.  I am in love.

I decided to read the reviews before I wrote mine....and how I agree with Adam M....(Much to my dismay!  LOL)  I didn't know about this bar before I came here, so I do not know much about the history.  I am just happy to find a place to go that plays Sisters of Mercy, the Smiths, and Ministry.  I now have hope that Scottsdale does have some down-to-earth dive punk bars that deserve its due.  I will say that the drinks suck...that is true.  The service, though, isn't that bad.  I was dressed up in a dress (since I just came from another event where I had to wear a little black dress)....I didn't look "punk" or "alternative" at all...and I was treated with respect.  (Odd enough)  It does help that I actually KNOW the songs that they played there and I am not some 20 year old poser.  But that is another story.  This place is very reminiscent of my younger days and I am very happy to have found it.  I just wish that Daniel Ash showed up before Midnight....DAMN!!!!

I will never ever go to Quiznos or Subway ever again!  Cheba Hut is definitely the best and most creative sub shop around. I had the White Widow sandwich on a garlic herb bun.  It came with chicken smothered in ranch, cheese, bacon,  and mushrooms.  I also added peppers and mustard and it was completely awesome.   Looking at the menu, I realize that really whatever I am in the mood for, they have.  I would give it -1 star for not having green chilies, but I will survive (and so will be esophogus)  Prices are very reasonable and I loved it that I had the choice of an 8" sub.  My biggest issue with the likes of Subway is that I could only get 6 or 12" when all I wanted was something in the middle.  I found a new love in Cheba Hut.  YUMMY!!!! And the decor ROCKS!!!!!

I went to Coffee Plantation last weekend when I was watching the Iron Man competition.  Yes we went to Starbucks first...but then we wanted to go shopping...and in the process of going shopping...we had to pee.  Only place around....Coffee Plantation!  After doing our business, the cuz and I decided that we were hungry...so we tried their turkey and bacon sandwich....oh my God!!!  I am not a big fan of turkey...but this was one amazing sandwich.  That and they had very yummy iced tea.  The best thing of all...it wasn't packed like Starbucks...amazing....

First things first....I love meat! I will never become a vegan or a vegetarian. But I am not going to turn my nose to a restaurant that serves Vegan/Vegetarian options only.   I loved the cool ambiance that Green offers. The staff is super friendly and gave me some great options since I explained my lack of vegan knowledge. I ended up ordering the mock fish and chips. Not my smartest decision. I have to remember never to order anything with the work mock in it. It doesn't mock the real thing, I don't care what they say.   I did enjoy the fries and their artichoke dip was amazing. I even took home a very tasty cupcake.   I would come back and try something a little more reasonable, like a salad or noodles.

Oh my...how I can't wait to go here again.  (Hint Hint Sarah G) Anyway...I just thought that the atmosphere was just awesome.  I loved the set up and the whole feel of the place. I have to say it was so hard to chose what I wanted to eat...knowing that it was lunch, I decided not to go with the pasta (zzzzzzzz) and had the Quiche of the Day (Spinach and Mushroom) that came with a regular salad and a fruit salad.  (I felt so healthy...minus the ranch I habitually drown my salad in...)  I even tried Sarah G's salmon...(first time trying it...and I just had salmon tonight...thank goodness House of Tricks was my first try of salmon...) I really really want to come here again and try another dish and the dessert! A little negative on the parking...but what do I expect from Downtown Tempe. When Sarah G gives her reviews...she will have pics!!!

So sad that I have to write an update on my ROTD :(  I still love you House of Tricks...but the service is just getting worse and worse.  I can't go there anymore during my work lunch...the servers take too long with drinks, food, the bill...and you know that I only have 80 minutes on the meter!  And it seems like the quiche is the best meal...the crepes I had the other day were just ok....it was a chicken, spinach and mushroom crepes...but with all of the mushrooms...I couldn't find any spinach or chicken!

After driving by this place a million times on my way to and from work, I finally got my chance to eat here yesterday for lunch with my work pals.  I really cannot complain about anything.  I loved my garlic vegetable dish with chili sauce and chicken.  The atmosphere was great and the place was very clean.  They never did ask if I wanted anything to drink, but I overlooked that since I was satisfied with water.  Prices were very reasonable....I really don't have anything negative to say. (there is a switch)  Now I have a new place to have lunch....

I never realized just how hard it was to shop for a bathing suit.  Since I am not of t ypical size (I refuse to go into more in this review about that), I can't go to a typical store (Everything But Water, Macy's...wherever) to find a bathing suit that fits.  After going to many stores on Saturday and experiencing lyrca burn everywhere on my body...I decided to check out this store.    While I feel that the customer service had a little bit to be desired, they had a wonderful selection of suits that fit any woman of any size.  The bikinis had a mix of sizes...and it just wasn't the typical small - large...they went by bra sizes all the way up to size G...they cater to everybody.  That alone makes it a wonderful experience.  While the type of bathing I was looking for was not a speciality of theirs (Speedo - and they did carry a few), I found a suit that fit and didn't make me look like a scary slob.  Also, the prices were spot on...I didn't have to pay a fortune to look good.  I give it 3.5 stars....selection was great...but they lost some on the customer service.  (Nice ladies...but they weren't very knowledgeable and when I walked out with the bathing suit on, they didn't say anything to me.  But when I walked out with my clothes on...they asked me what I thought...a little late, I may say)

I finally got to see my Red Wings play here in AZ last Saturday.  I was in complete heaven.  I do have to say that I feel real sorry for the Phoenix Coyotes (who did play a great game) because I will have to say the place was swarming with Red Wing Fans.  When the announcer was trying to get the Coyotes fans to make some noise, they made sure that the music was very loud to make it sound like there were some fans there.  Enough about that.  I have to say that I was very comfortable in my seat (I was behind the Coyotes bench, about 15 rows back) and what I was mainly impressed with was the acoustics in the arena.  Also, there was no obstruction, so it seemed that wherever you sat, you had a great view of the game.  I had a fantastic time, but I think it helped that the Wings won.  I left there without a voice (I tend to yell a lot at the refs like they can hear me or care what I have to say) and I especially liked the fact that I didn't have to pay for parking.  I love what they are doing down there at the arena with the shops and the restaurants.  Overall, the experience was amazing.  I can't wait for the Red Wings to come back so I can go there again.

I came here tonight to meet a friend for a drink.  We haven't seen each other in awhile, and I have to say that this place was a great place to meet somebody and just talk.    Of course we ended up getting an appetizer (the quesadilla...which we asked for without goat cheese.  I never had asparagus in my quesadilla before, but I have to say that it was really good!) and we got iced tea to drink.  If there was something that impressed me was how many times the waiter came by to refill our drinks...without ASKING!  I never knew they did that anymore....  I loved the atmosphere of this place.  The staff was very friendly.  What I really liked was that I didn't feel like I was sitting on top of anybody.  Everything was laid out nicely and spaciously.  The only thing that was negative was the prices...they were a little outrageous.  But I never really complain if I get great food and great service.

I have to remember that places in Vegas to eat are a little more expensive then at home.  That being said, I was still in a little bit of a sticker shock at how expensive Shibuya actually is.  Located at the MGM (my least favorite hotel on the strip, btw) Shibuya was a great place to get my craving for Teppanyaki....I was a little peeved that our table wasn't ready until about half hour after our reservations...and that the table was empty....it was just for my friend and I.  It is always so much more fun with more people.  We had a great chef making our food...very personable...though sometimes I thought he talked too much.  Food was great, cooked to perfection.

Getting upgraded to a Suite at the Hotel at the Mandalay Bay was a gift from the Gods!!! While it was a hike to get to the gambling and the pool...it was so worth the stay in their wonderful suites. Shout out to the wonderful concierge...Michelle and Rika. The rooms were phenomonal.  Shout out for the suite for having the most comfortable beds and TWO bathrooms!  I just wished it wasn't so far from gambling....but I will be back there again!  Can't wait!  FYI - if I wasn't staying there, I never would have met Sam Elliott...super awesome!

Ok, I hate this place.  I am only giving it the extra 2nd star because I was able to get in VIP...and the bouncers are actually very nice there. Why do I hate this place?  First of all, the go-go dancers there are a joke.  The people that were there were just plain nasty wanna-be somethings...I don't even think there is a name for it.  I have no idea which side is which...but the DJ sucked on both sides.  One side smelled like pot and piss.  And my drink was HORRIBLE!!!    Still had a great time though.  (Maybe because I was drunk)

I am not sure that this is going to be the review of the lifetime about the Captial Grille...but here it goes!  I went there with a couple of friends a month ago...I was worried because I was low on funds and I knew that the Capital Grille is quite pricey.    We were seated right away (we did have a reservation) and we sat at the smoking patio.  (I am not a smoker, but my friend is. It's nice to know that there are places that still offer this though.  I am not anti-smoking in restaurants)  I order one of their specialty drinks (my first mistake when trying to watch funds) and asked for the vodka to be Belvedere (My 2nd mistake)  i saw their menu and I order the lobster bisque and the chopped salad.  (2 very wise choices because prices weren't too bad and they were both very tasty)  I did look over with envy to see my friends sea bass....sigh....  After ordering my 2nd drink (third mistake) we were ready to go.  Service wasn't the best (they were more worried about the big party that was going to be seated next to us) but the food was really good.  And if I didn't order those drinks....I wouldn't have been depressed the next day that I didn't have any money left.

I am beginning to be hooked on sushi.  Two years ago, I would have told you that sushi was just wrong....but now I am wrong :)  I went to Sushi Eye on Friday with my wonderful and lovely friend. (You know who you are) I was excited to go there, especially with the rave reviews.  At first I was a little put off since I thought that our server was a little bit of a moron with a splash of attitude.  I ordered an iced tea and before it took her over ten minutes to come back so I could get some pink packets to sweeten it up.  (And that tea was dark!)  After that little slip, everything was perfect...(though my miso soup didn't have any seaweed in it...which is odd in my book)  I had the Spicy Scallop and the Philly Roll...both were awesome!  And my friend's California Roll with Asparagus was the best.  I will have to order that next time for sure.  The sushi chef was very nice and the other server there was more attentive.  I loved the menu and it had a lot to offer.  (And since I am don't know a lot of my sushi yet, I liked it that they had descriptions)  The place was clean and I really liked the layout.  I will have to go there again and have some sake as well. :)

I am most definitely a fan.  My friend was taking me out to dinner the other night and it was my choice.  I have been to Sierra Bonita a long time ago and I remember that I loved my experience there before.  This time it was just as memorable.  For starters we had the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Oh boy was that pleasure in my mouth! I had the buttermilk chicken with the side of mashed chipotle sweet potatoes.  It was amazing....and I made sure I left room for dessert!  I told myself I would only have a bite of the bread pudding and save the rest for later.    Yeah....that didn't happen.  I devoured that amazing dessert with spectacular speed.    I can't wait to go back to try something new!!!

My review is based on both times I had the pleasure of experiencing Bloom. The first was for Happy Hour...the service and the atmosphere were divine.  The wine list is phenomenal and well as the prices. The bartender was very thorough with the descriptions of all the wine until I picked a very sweet white wine that I probably would never had tried any other time.  (Very sweet, but good!)  I loved it that there was a group of probably 20-30 of us and the bartender had no problem giving up individual checks.  (I also had the tomato and mozzarella salad, which was good...but I saw the lobster salad...and well....)  The second time was last night...and I had the lobster salad.  This was probably the most amazing salad I ever had!  Warm Alaskan Lobster with asparagus and a white vinaigrette dressing.  I even asked for tomatoes and the server was very accommodating (and didn't even charge me extra.)  My sweet dear friend Lisa was going to get the Ahi Tuna, but changed her mind to the lobster salad as well when she was able to substitute the asparagus for broccoli.  She also agreed that the salad was amazing and even put her in an amazing mood!  What good food can do to us :)  I would so love to go there again and try more of their menu...(even though it will be so hard to stay away from the salad)  But I will definitely be back.

I wish I could review their food...but I can't.  Why you ask?  Because my party never got seated!  My friend Rayna was nice to give this place 2 stars, but I can't even do that.  I was so disppointed by the whole experience, especially since I was looking forward to my first Tapas experience ever.  I was over the moon excited, but the service was such a let down, I don't think I would ever give it a second chance.  I am not trying to be Ms. Whinypants here. I understand the whole sitting with others at the table concept.  When my two friends and I showed up for my friend's birthday party, we were greeted right away.  We said that we had a party of 6 and they will be there in less than 5 minutes.  The hostess explained that we could sit at the bar and wait, but she couldn't seat us until our whole party arrived.  She did point out that there was seating for 6 people and she was going to reserve it for us, but she couldn't hold it until the whole party arrived.  Well, while we were waiting, a couple walked in and asked to be seated.  There were other places for them to be seated....but she chose to seat them at our "reserved" spot.  After that, while we were still standing there, she ignored us.  Didn't explain to us that she had to seat them there or anything.  We were just completely ignored.  Even when she noticed that another person in our party arrived. An explanation would have been nice.    We thought it was unprofessional and lost the customer service appeal altogher.  We felt like she chose 2 people or 6.    So we left and decided to have a fantasic experience at Barrio Cafe....review coming soon!

Yes I may be picky.  But now I feel like I have to vomit.  A co-worker of mine told me that I had to try this place if I loved bbq.  Well, I am a sucker for ribs, but today I feel like just a sucker.  Horrible service "I would like to order a carry-out." "Then move over there"), horrible homemade Root Beer (I am drinking plain syrup and sugar), and horrible pain that I now have in my stomach.  2 stars are for the Mac n Cheese...which I must say was burnt just right.  (I love burnt Mac n cheese...yum!)

Met my friend for lunch here the other day.  Neither of us ever heard of it, but since we were in the area, we thought to check it out.  We sat outside, something that I never do.  The furniture was extremely dirty (we sat on some patio furniture), but that really is my only complaint.  Food was really good...I have been in the mood for grilled cheese lately and theirs was wonderful. (Bacon, tomato, avacado) My friend is a vegetarian and really could get the veggie wrap for a sandwich.  She enjoyed it but the sandwich was huge!  It was a great place to hang out and catch up... :)

i have to thank Sarah G for telling me about this place...the desserts alone are worth going in there.  They have this white macadamia nut cookie that is to die for (and I hate nuts!)  The breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about.  Lunch is great, though they have a thing for red  onions.  The grape leaves aren't typical greek style grape leaves, but they are still good. The grilled cheese I had one day was awesome...but I kept on asking myself....how did I spend $18 just on myself?    While the food is great...the prices for the quantity of food you are getting is the only hold back I can think of.

I hate to do this, but after today's experience, I am at a loss...  I don't even know where to start.  I love going here, but something has to change.  I always look forward to Essence...but today I just shake my head.  I went to the counter to order my Hamburger with Cheese (and extra .85 cents)  which is a new item on the menu which I have had before.  I loved it the first time.  I was not in the mood for a salad and I asked what I could do for a substitute and they said I could add potato chips for an extra dollar.  I let that one slide and then I asked for an Iced Tea and if it could be in a to go cup and they said that they would have to charge me an extra .50 cents.  I asked why and the girl at the counter said it has to do with refills.  "But I get refills in my Glass, correct?" "Yes, but that is the way the owner has it."  Now I am a little annoyed, but I try to get over it.  My lovely luncheon date, the wonderful Sarah G thought I was in a bad mood, and then I explained my issues with the counter.    I get my food...put my mayonaise all over it and then I cut into the meat...completely raw.  (Please remember that I did not put the top part of the bun and lettuce on my sandwich yet)  I cut into it in the middle just to make sure...and yep!  Red raw meat....I went to the counter and explained my finding and she said that she will put it back on to cook a little longer.  I explained to her that I cut into it and I had put the mayonaise on it...but she said she will take care of it.  So I get it back...with the bun on top of my hamburger.  I look underneath, and there is my cut up hamburger.  I take the bun off and noticed that the bottom half of the bunch is extremely soggy.  I also bite into it and it scorched my mouth.  I don't know that they did, but it was completely unacceptable.  On top of it, which didn't surprise me, the hamburger was COMPLETELY DRY.    Sarah and I both noticed that the staff did not come by at all to ask how our food turned out.  I went back up to the counter and told her that I couldn't even it my lunch.  The girl said that the cook ASSURED her that it wouldn't get dry....and I told her that she was assured incorrectly. They did end up refunding my money...after the fact I noticed that I didn't get reimbursed for my cheese.  (LOL)  My Parfait was awesome...that was a plus...their desserts are always so yummy.  Please Please Please Essence...I want to be able to come back next time and give you back at least 2 extra starts....  And by the way....I am still hungry

Vegas never fails...and the concierge at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay deserves a raise after recommending this restaurant. My mom was having a craving for Prime Rib and Strip Steak was where we were told we had to have it!   We arrived promptly for our reservations at 10pm. I was already on a happy high from seeing the Jersey Boys (best show on Earth) but wasn't as hungry as I thought. They gave us complimentary duck fries (amazing) so after I was done eating those, I knew that I didn't want a big meal. My mom ended up having the Prime Rib...which reminded more of a Filet Mignon. It was cooked to perfection. And she also ordered onion rings...which I couldn't stop gobbling up. (Yes I was eating off her plate...but she allowed me to. In fact, we ended up splitting the meal and they didn't charge us for an extra plate.) I ended up ordering 1/2 dozen oysters (can't get off this oyster kick) which were just as amazing as the ones I had the night prior at the Aria. Top that off with the best vodka and tonic (I was drunk after one....) I was in heaven.  StripSteak was the best way to end such a memorable night. Can't wait to go back.

I can't help but update my review with another 5 star update.    Forgive me Father (though I am Jewish) for I have sinned....sinning at Stripsteak!  How does one sin at a restaurant?  Well I am in Vegas for goodness sake!  2nd time I was there...my friend and I got our meal paid for by 40 drunk men participating in a Bacehlor party...she and I just wished we knew about it before we finished our meals.  We would have ordered a Kobe steak!  3rd time was a special treat.  Said friend and I finally treated Vegas the way it was meant to be treated!  And the employees at Stripsteak were more than happy to oblige.  (Wish I could indulge exactly what happened....but what happens in Vegas...well you know the rest) Again, meals were paid for, but this time she and I lived it up by ordering the Kobe Rib Eye, Macaroni and Cheese (OMG!) and a bunch of oysters!  And the Merlot that was served was perfect for this type of meal.  Can't wait when I go back this month...what wild stories I may have then!!!

I loved your Hummus... I loved your Pita Bread I somewhat liked my Spinach Casserole  But your service needs a lot of help.  1.  My Greyhound was served in a glass with dirt. 2.  There were 4 of us at a table.  2 of my companions got their shish kebab 10 minutes before my friend and I got our meals.   3.  Our server actually said "Is there anything else you need before I go on my break?"  9pm on a Saturday night no less, you get breaks?  I guess there was also supposed to be a tarot card reader that they advertise, but she hasn't shown up in three-four weeks.  Think she is still coming?    At least I was with awesome and intelligent people that made my time there a lot of fun...so I wasn't bitter last night.  (even if I was seated hunched over.  The seating is not good for the back.)  Wished I was in the room with the belly dancing (she could have least came into the other room where most people were dining).  My friend was a little upset over that.

I found my home away from home!  This place is the healthy Greek Haven I have been looking for since I moved to Phoenix!    From the wonderful and friendly staff to the amazing food (chicken salad is the bomb!!!) Zoe's Kitchen is such a treat!  I love the chicken kabobs and the rice is awesome!  I have not once had a dry piece of chicken and their salad dressing is super tasty!  Whenever I have a weird craving for something fast, I show up here. (and lately it has been 3-4 times a week)  I have turned on friends to this place and they also told me it was divine. (heresay perhaps?  So what!)   I am not a fan of their chocolate cake though. I had to try it, and it seemed like something I could back myself.  That is the only drawback I could think of.  But who cares!  Chocolate cake isn't healthy for you anyway!

I know that this happened a few months back....but why did you change your menu???  My staple now (with the new menu) are the roll ups.  They are really good...and they do come with sides.  But I even feel that the rice doesn't even taste the same anymore.  I will still be a regular for sure....but I am sad to see some of my fixes are gone :(

I wish this place wasn't out of my way for breakfast or lunch, or I would be there more often. I went in there today for a last minute lunch idea...I just love how friendly the staff is.  The owner seemed to know everybody there, or just was really good at acting like it.  She even made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  I usually go with my staple, the grilled chicken sandwich.  I usually get this when i am in the mood for heartburn, since it comes with cheese, tomato, lettuce, and my heartburn favorite, Green Chiles....yummy!  I love it that they serve it on a Challah role...  I always polish off my meal with their chocolate chip cookies, that are out of this world.  Will update when I go there for breakfast.  I just wish that they were open later than 2pm...my only negative thought about the whole experience.

So I went to two Zipps locations this weekend for two separate football games.  This location definitely made a bigger impact on me, and not in a good way.  Food was alright...nothing too amazing...but it is a sports bar.  I wasn't expecting much.    Drinks...my friends loved their drinks...I didn't drink this night.  I knew I was going to be riled up for the Lions/Saints game (sadly not in a positive way since the Lions lost!)  It was the service that killed the whole experience.  Our server...and I wished I remembered her name (I think we never got it actually) was simply AWFUL!  She had this fetish about clearing napkins up (I set my napkin down for a second and there she was whisking it away...and also she took a napkin on mine that had a phone number on it) but she didn't know how to clear the baskets away or wipe down the table that had wet spots everywhere.  And when we wanted more drinks in the second half of the game...she was non-existent.  We asked other servers for our server and they were clueless about who had our table.  My friend had to go to the bar to get another drink (which was finally during happy hour)  Minus the service...the bar is just a typical sports bar.  Nothing too special.

I probably liked this place more than I should since we got in free for being a Mandalay Bay guest. The view was extraordinary and the drinks weren't over the top expensive.  I realized that Belvedere is my favorite vodka...and SKYY Vodka is the well at every place in Vegas.  The music really wasn't bad either. And I didn't feel like anybody's mother...which was AWESOME!!!

Really...people like this place?  It's bad enough when the bartender can't make a drink correctly the first time.  (Vodka and Tonic mind you...and I think I only tasted tonic water)  When you go back (or in this case Robert M took it back for me since the bartender ignored me the first time I tried) the drink tastes 10x worse.  Music was good though.

Ok...I am going to say this...I am extremely disappointed in Sprinkles.  I tried my first Sprinkles cupcake back when they first opened.  (Thank you very much Sarah G) I thought the cupcake was AMAZING!  But, i am now thinking this was just way to suck you in.  The reason why I say this is the last 2 times I had cupcakes from Sprinkles, I did not have the same AMAZING experience.  Simply put.  The frosting was good....I cannot complain there...but I am not a frosting fan, I am a cake fan.  The cake on the cherry blossom and the lemon cupcake was DRY!  I gave my manager at work the red velvet.  She also said the same thing, frosting: GREAT cake: DRY.  Then she asked me how much I spent on the suckers and she was floored.  $ 3.25 for that?  INSANE!

I really wanted to try Radio Milano again and give it another chance.  The first time I was there, it was for the Yelp event, and it was not impressed with the food.    I met my friends last night for a dinner party...company was fabulous :)  I was the 4th person to show up and noticed that my other 3 friends got a table for 4.  I was like NO!!!  3 more people are going to show up.  Radio Milano was very accommodating with the table arrangements.  (Which is to say that the service from beginning to end was phenomenal.    We all ordered 2 bottles of sangiovese~merlo wine (which was amazing) and we also some of us split our meals, which gave us a chance to try different things.  I split the house-made papardelle (which came with vegetables that I would have never thought of putting in pasta - Brussels sprouts, squash, and artichokes) which was extremely tasty...though a little too buttery.  They hand made their pasta, which gives it an extra plus.  I also tried the chopped salad which was AMAZING!!!  Yes people, a salad can be that good!  For dessert I had the Chocolate Budino...very rich and you definitely need to share that with others...  This was such a great place to have a mini dinner party...very easy to talk to your friends and the server doesn't hound you every moment...she really came by at the "right" times.  She was also very accommodating with the bill when we had to split it 8 million different ways.  (ok, just 5...but still)    I loved loved loved it!  So happy I came back!

Ok Dirty Pretty...I am adding a star to you.... I had such a blast there the other  night.  I still hate most of the music that they play there on Saturday nights (this is a "rock" bar, right?) but I will let that go by.  The atmosphere was extremely different than the last time I was there.  The place was dark and people were actually DANCING!  The service is awesome (shout out to Victor and Justin for my friend, Jen of course) And I have to say that the bathrooms were pretty clean for a bar bathroom.  The people there that night also weren't the pretentious Scottsdale type...which made me feel very comfortable.  Dirty Pretty, play more rock music and I will give you 5 stars.

Went to see local bands play here last night with Amy D and her awesome friends.  Totally my kind of bar...dark, dirty, divey, and with killer bands playing.  Very spacious...but that could have something to do with the fact that the place wasn't really packed.   I didn't drink this night, but I did notice that Budweiser was $6.  (Not a beer drinker, but that seems a little high, I think)  But somebody was buying the drinks.  I think last night was the first time I actually had a guy fall on top of me. (And I guess my response was priceless)  The bar is in a strip mall, so parking wasn't too bad.  (I think that I came at the right time, but be careful where you park or you may get towed)   The most important part of the night was that I saved Amy D's life...I removed a splinter from her hand.  I rock!  Peace!

Wow, I was in complete heaven...  I was the proud winner of the hot stone massage gift certificate at Gabi's Ice Cream Social event at Sweet Republic.  I remember that day vividly because my back was killing me and I was like, I better win this!  Yay me!  My massage therapist (who I realize now never gave me her name) performed an amazing hot stone massage.  (I would never get a full hot stone on my own, but this was an amazing experience)  I also added on a 10 foot rub, which was so nice.  I also base my massages on the atmosphere...and it was very relaxing, from the lighting to the music. (Where I usually go, I feel like I am in a jungle, so this was a great alternative)  I will probably not go here again until I get enough money to be able to have a membership every month.  (Just not in the budget) They have 8 locations I believe, 3 in my area.  So if I ever want to belong to an exclusive massage spa, then I would definitely pick Hand and Stone.

So happy that I came here today...I was already stressing out at Tempe Marketplace (I was a little klutzy with my packages)  I was hungry and almost did the horrible thing and have the Cheesecake Factory desserts at Barnes and Noble when I noticed Tea Infusion...I have been here once before for Yelp Office Hours. I love their selections of tea and that you can buy them loose.  It was a little hot out today, so I decided to have their Peach Iced Tea.  (Free refills!)  I am not a fan of fruity teas, but this was wonderful and it didn't give me heartburn. I got a Tuna Melt for lunch...excellent!  (They used white albacore tuna...and they only mix it with mayonnaise.  So happy to find a place that makes tuna without onions!) The best though, was their pasta salad...it was awesome.   Next time I would love to try one of their smoothies.  I love the fact that while it is small, they have many areas to sit.  (I sat at the bar area)  The staff was very nice and accommodating...(especially when Miss Klutz was a little messy with her sandwich....)

Moe saved the night!  I had to try this place...after hearing amazing reviews...  So after waiting 45 minutes for a table (even though I did make reservations for 8pm) we finally got our table.  (I know that a lot of you like the decor...I just wasn't feeling it...a little too basic for me)  After being seated..it took another 20 minutes to have the General Manager come over to ask us if we have been asked for drinks yet.  I replied that nobody has even greeted us yet.  He took our drink order (I got this Pomegrante and Sunflower Iced Tea...which was AMAZING...weird since I HATE flavored tea) and he even took time to explain the menu to us.  Since we still didn't have a server yet, the GM (now I know his name is Moe) took our orders and even offered suggestions. We ended up with (I wish I wrote down the actual names of the dishes) Shrimp Tempura (out of this world), Cucumber Roll with this amazing plum sauce, this tasty salmon roll with asparagus, beef skewers, and scallops that were AWESOME with this AWESOME mayonaise in the center.    Of course since their servings were extremely small and my friend Karla and I were sharing...I needed some dessert.  I got the Strawberry and Honey Chawan Mushi with Apple Pear, Passion Fruit, and Banana.  First of all, it looks like salsa, the way the fruit was chopped up.  Then I tasted it.  Ewwww....not good at all.  Moe felt bad, knowing that we had to clean our palattes...so gave us vanilla sorbet and green tea ice cream instead...on the house and even took off the other dessert.  Moe Rules!  I didn't find the place to be too pricey...I have been to worse.  I even played a game with my friend about guessing the price.  She guessed $78....and I said $ 57.63.  I didn't even add up anything in my head.  The bill came out and it was $ 57.85.  (My friend thought I had some amazing psychic powers...)  Food 5 stars...well for dinner.  I won't even comment on the dessert, because I knew that I should have gotten the Flan.... I should give it 2 stars for service...but like I said...their new General Manager Moe...saved the day.  He was awesome!  Moe rocks.

I have never been to a hotel bar lounge in my life that was so friggin DARK!  Outside and inside...heck, outside on the patio I barely could see where I was walking.  Not sure if this was entirely necessary.  Everything is spacious and the seating was very comfortable.  And yes I know that I am at a resort in Scottsdale...but I was starving and still couldn't see myself paying $23 for an appetizer...or $10 for some fries.  (duck fries, whatever)  The drink selection was amazing and the server was even nice enough to give a starving chickie some pretzels :)  I would definitely go there again though...if somebody took me on a date.  (hint hint)

Never have I been so disappointed in a place that I couldn't wait to check out.  This is one restaurant that I will never go back to.  Sarah G and I went there for a late lunch...we walked in and was told to sit anywhere we wanted to. I guess they just had a big party and there were many tables that were not cleaned up.  But I also noticed that the waiter was by himself, so I didn't make a deal about it. I also noticed that the decor was a little bit on the cheap side and definitely didn't have that "wine" bar appeal.  We decided to order 2 appetizers and our entrees. (When we ordered our food, the waiter gave us a strange look, knowing that we were out of our minds for ordering so much food.  He could have warned us that my sandwich was going to be huge) For the appetizers we got calamari and spinach and artichoke dip.  Calamari was chewy and greasy, but the tomato basil sauce was actually very good.  Spinach dip was good, loved the cripsy bread.  Then came our entrees.  I won't go into Sarah G's food, but my chicken club sandwich was on the verge of horrible.  They had this chipolte sauce was way too sweet for this type of sandwich and even though I asked for no onion, I could still taste onion.  The sandwich was also a pool of grease. I could barely take 2 bites of it.  The funny thing was that the french fries were the only thing that wasn't greasy.  The waiter must have had an idea of our dissatisfaction because he never once asked us how our food was.  When we finally came by, we complained.  He took off our lunches from the bill.  By then, though, my stomach was reeling from all of that grease that i had just consumed.    Not happy at all.

Ok Ok Ok...I said in my last review that I would never go back.  I lied.    Met some friends there that actually frequent the place.  They knew the servers, which made the experience a little bit better.  While waiting for my friend's husband to show up, we shared the calamari.  Yes folks, this was not fresh calamari...but you know what? Who cares!  First off, I am in AZ...second, wherever it came from....it was was good!  We were going to order the spinach and artichoke dip, but our server informed us that ladies get $$$ off the brushetta.  I wasn't thrilled with the Traditional Brushetta....felt like it was was missing something.  The Caprese was excellent, but the Artichoke was by far the best.  I could have ordered more if I had to.    The wine list is extensive, and I promise the next time I go I will get some.  (I saw the prices, and they weren't that bad) The wine pairings is something that I would also love to try out.....5 courses for $65 is not a bad deal at all.  Can't wait to go back.

A few weeks ago, I asked many of my friends (on a status post on Facebook) where I should go to get my curly hair taken care of.  I thank you all for your suggestions.  I chose this place (do to my friend's hair looking awesome and the prices) and I am very happy with my results.    I went to Beth for my haircut and she took one look at my hair and knew that I had to chop a lot of it off.  I wasn't happy about this, but I knew that with all of the blonde color I put in my hair, it had to be done.  She gave me a bob that I think looks awesome.  In fact, I never got so many compliments on my hair.    I went back again to get my hair colored. Beth is great at multi-tasking and also had this girl Shiloh assist as well.  Shiloh was very sweet and does a mean hair wash.    I can't wait to go back to experience their other spa services.  I also like it that they are a Bumble and Bumble salon...which is by far my favorite hair product line.

Ok...I am into dive bars.  This place is not a dive bar, it is just plain filth.  I never felt so disgusting in a drinking establishment in my life.   My drink was horrible and my partner in crime was getting hit on by some nasty guy with sores on his face.  People were playing beer pong on a ping pong table...which then made me feel like I was 16 years old.  I am actually embarassed for this place.

I will agree with the overpriced issue with Jersey Mike's.  Besides that...this is the best damn Philly Cheese Steak I have had in Arizona.  (I am not from Philly, so I admit I am not a pro at the Cheese Steak cuisine)  Everything there is fresh, from the bread to the veggies to the meat.  My sandwich is never a mess..which is amazing in itself. Service is great, even for ASU students working there.  Great location....Really can't say anything bad about the place...it just sucks when there is construction on Scottsdale road and it makes it almost impossible to get there.  (One day it was so bad, I had to settle for Rubios....not a good settle when all you want is a cheese steak.)

5+++++++++++++ stars....Best show that I ever saw.  If you close your eyes, you think that Travis Cloer IS Frankie Valli.  Scene Stealer Deven May was AMAZING at Tommy DeVito and Peter Saide made an awesome addition to the cast as Bob Gaudio. I sang, I laughed, I cried.  This is the must - see in Vegas.    The venue was perfect without an obstructed seat in the house.  (We were in the 2nd row on the stage left side - and while we had to lift our heads up a little bit, it wasn't bothersome) The props and the sound was perfect.    And it was super awesome that I met the actors afterwards.  Super sweet guys and took the time to talk to their fans.

Laying out at the Beach...where it was only 51 degrees outside made my stay at the Mandalay Bay complete.  But damn does this place get crowded with every douchebag and tiny chick imaginable. (Well, this is Vegas.)  When I go back in a couple of weeks, I will review the wave pool...which was so reminiscent of my days at summer camp.  The cold weather didn't stop a lot of kids and adults for enjoying the wave pool though.  I also loved the sand that they had...who knew you could get the beach in Vegas?  The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. I was surrounded by the nicest people on the planet.  (They were drunk and relaxed...excellent combo)  Drinks were a little over the top in prices, but again...it's Vegas.  My only major gripe (besides the douchebags and tiny chicks) was the prices of the cabanas.  Next time I go, I need to find a rich man (or men) so I can live it up.  The best thing was that I left with a sunburn.  Success!

It is extremely necessary that I update my review...  This is about the atmosphere and hospitality that I received last night. While it is true that I was there with a friend who is a regular there, the staff couldn't have been more personable and engaging to me.  Antonio and Robert (I so hope I got the names right!) treated me like they had known me forever, which gave me that warm and fuzzy feeling inside.  My Pinot Grigio was chilled just right.  I would love to try one of Cork's wine dinners sometime, since all I hear are rave reviews about it.    I am going to write another update on Saturday when I go back there to try some yummy quiche. :)

Again with the five stars...  I met up with Aileen, Violeta, and Brynn last night to experience their happy hour menu.  Great prices, awesome food, and even better drinks!  I had the Prime Better Burger...the burger was a little undercooked for medium, but I didn't mind it that much.  (Yes I did put up a little fuss...but if anybody knows me - that's typical) and the short rib that was on top of the burger was perfection!!!  I had two of their drinks (I can't for the life of me remember the first one that I had, but I thought the Floral champagne cocktail was the bomb!!!  Made me extra happy.  If for anything else, the service is always top notch...and it was extra special nice of Robert the owner (who always makes me feel so welcome) sent over to our a table a glass for each of us of this dessert wine that he just got in.  And he also took time out to explain the new Sunday night dinner with wine pairings that Cork is offering, plus the Sunday Brunch and his ideas for Thanksgiving.  I know that Cork is out of the way for most of you...but if you are ever out in the area, please stop by.  It is so worth it.

Lets get the negative out of the way first...Sautee gets minus one star for serving the entrees way too soon after getting the appetizer.  Besides that, I loved it!  I went there last night to meet my friend and her husband for dinner.  They are new to Chandler and we were thinking of places to go and I mentioned this place since I always wanted to go.    I walked in where on the right is the bar area.  There was live music from this guy who was just awesome.  The music wasn't too loud and I was still able to have a conversation with my friends.  Stacey was our server and she was patient and extremely knowledgeable  about the wines.  She recommended a bottle of Pinot Noir for us (though I was hesitate since I am not a red fan at all) and I am now a convert!  LOL, we ended up finishing two bottles. (I think I am still drunk)  We started off the night with the calamari for the appetizer.  The calamari itself was cooked perfectly, though I could have done with the sauces that were with it.  (A chipolte chili drizzle and a key lime red pepper sauce)  I ended ordering the Panko chicken with spinach, avocado and a side of fruit. (Trying to stay a little healthy)  It was amazing and cooked just right.  My friend had the Garlic Feta Shrimp Wrap that she said was great and her husband had the Tortellini...put it this way I never saw somebody finish a meal that quickly.  He loved it.  I loved the atmosphere was this place...upscale without the pretentiousness.  The company definitely help, of course. I will be back for sure.

I think we can all agree that moving sucks.  I was thinking...do I ask my friends with trucks for help?  Then I thought that after all the time we waste going back and forth and then I will probably have to buy then dinner...it just wasn't worth it.  So I did my research, and decided that Camelback Moving was the best way to go!  And my decision wasn't wrong!  They are so extremely affordable...I was at first nervous because I was thinking you can't be that good and cheap at the same time.  Wrong!  They got everything from my apartment to my condo in 3 hours! The two guys, Mack and his right hand man (not sure of his name) were a pleasure to deal with.  Very professional and personable at the same time!  Even when I booked the appointment, I was speaking with the owner of the company.  He was amazing as well.  No job is too small for them and you get the same type of service even if I was moving into a mansion in Paradise Valley.  If I ever move again (which looks like maybe one more time in the next couple of years) I will for sure be using Camelback Moving!

I was recommended to go to Max Muscle from my awesome trainer (yes the one I talk so much about).  He knew that I wasn't getting enough protein in my diet, so he said, "Go to Max Muscle".  So I did. This location, I was impressed with the knowledge of the manager that was working there that day.  He was in great shape (for a body builder...gross) and even let me test drink different protein shakes.  We chose the brand and flavor...and guess what?  They were out of stock until Monday.  Go figure....  This location is much better than the other location...which I will be review next.

I know this is weird that I am writing about a cafe at University of Phoenix, but this place is amazing.  UPX has a couple of cafes...one that is next door to my office, which I can't even think about reviewing because I am not thrilled with it and I find it odd that you get a grilled cheese with fries for $7.    If you drive the I-10, you have noticed the new buildings that UPX has built.  Well, inside one of those building is the most amazing cafe that any office can offer.  I mean they have Executive Head Chef's making amazing dishes.  And there are like all of these different food stations...and you can get a grilled cheese and fries for $4 instead.  And if you want, you can have prime rib for lunch, or amazing salads, or any of their specials of day.  For a reasonable price.  You feel like you are going to an upscale Golden Corral....but tastes so much better.  Amazing....I just wished I worked in one of those buildings so I can go there more often.

Ok, first off, it has to be known that I am not anywhere near of being a vegan.  I love my filet mignon, chicken piccante, and sea bass.  But I am always up for trying new things and my friend wanted to meet their last night for dinner, so I was game.  I was pleasantly surpised with my choices...though i wished I ordered what my friend ordered.  (I ordered a lemongrass seaweed tofu thing, that I cannot remember the name of it for the life of me)  She even said she liked my entree much better than her Vegetarian Spare Ribs (which I though was AMAZING) I also ordered cucumber rolls, since I saw that it had white radishes in them (YUM)    So, now I know one thing...I have a distaste for Tofu.  But I will not hold it against the establishment since it isn't their fault.  But it was their fault that I was sweating like a pig in that place.    The staff was very nice and helpful.  The server had great suggestions for entrees.

Oh was I desperate yesterday and Pitaya came to my rescue.  I went to the Blackout Party last night, and yes, of course, I decide at the last minute to buy my dress.  After going to 2 malls, buying things I wasn't satisfied with at Nordstrom, I was about to give up.  I was getting my hair done at Mood Swings, and I had some time to kill, so I went next door to Pitaya.  These clothes were so adorable, and I was scared that I wasn't able to fit into anything.  This adorable girl helped me pick out some black dresses and even waited for me to model the dresses.  We picked out this great black sun dress that I could totally bling up.  And the price!  $34!!!!  And they also had great accessories to boot.    I will be there again...especially if I have a blue or pink party to go to.  I love it how they have everything in the store organized by color.  Made finding things so much easier.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT

4.5 stars  Here is the scoop...I love getting my gel manicures...and at the place I usually go it costs me around $50 each time (for not a great job, btw...) So after my last manicure, I was fed up, so I called the Pampered Pinkie.  I was talking to owner and she told me that they charge $33 for a gel mani...I told her I was shocked...she said that there are more places that are needed that don't charge obscene amount of money (Dolce) but charges enough so us girls don't have to go to the corner chop shops to get our nails done at a cheap price.  So I checked them out.  The place was really cute, an old fashioned set up with a cute boutique with clothing and jewelry to match.  My nails were done extremely well and the girls there were very personable.  My experience was very enjoyable and will be back.  I also got a pedicure, which was also very enjoyable.  I also liked it that my feet were soaking in a tub (like from the 1800's)  instead of the typical jet tubs.  It made me feel that they sanitized everything and felt safe sticking my feet in there.  The only drawbacks is that it took them almost 3 hours to do my nails and feet...and the girls can get sidetracked easily with their conversations.  But I will definitely be back.

Ugh....when you have thoughts that you are going to a dive bar, and you get this?  Not a pleasant thought.  Went there with a friend on Saturday night (can you all guess who that was??? LOL)  and the first thing I kept on thinking was..."Wow this place is bright."  Very sports bar atmosphere with horrible Karaoke and weird people.    Yes, there were a lot of ladies there....so the pickings for men were slim.  I had a couple of drinks and all I wanted was to find a decent guy to stick my tongue down his throat!  (Kidding, y'all)  All I got was some pretty boy who thought we were talking about curling and some weird dude next to us who sings a bad ass Barry Manilow.   Oh!  And when we were waiting for our ride (plus on the car service availability) some weird freak of nature walked up to us outside.  He was talking to me in some weird radio announcer voice in my ear.  All I wanted to do was run hom and shower and sanitize my hair and ear.    2 stars for the chicken fingers (yummy) and car service.    So not a dive bar.

I finally made it!!! This is now by far my favorite bar in Las Vegas!!!!   The ambiance alone makes the bar what it is. Everybody there is too party, and party right! The only thing that I got annoyed with is that it was hard to escape the unwanted male....there really wasn't anywhere to hide. Music could have been more rock n roll....but I didn't care.   Hopefully the next time I am there, Carey Hart will be there as well.

This was the best Thai food I ever had Hands Down!  If it wasn't for the horrible soup they give you in the beginning, I would give it five stars. My friend also fell in love as well.  She got the Spicy Eggplant that she said was the best she ever had at a Thai Restaurant.  My drunken noodles with veggies and chicken was also very tasty.  I even liked their spring rolls and rice. I actually liked the mediocre service that they gave.  They didn't hound me for anything anddidn't ask if my food was good when my mouth was full of food.  They were always available if I needed anything though, which I thought was important.  The first time I went there a few months ago, I wasn't impressed.  I am so happy that I went there again.  I will be coming back.

I really really really want to like the District!  But both times I was there, I had awful service - all due to the kitchen screwing up the orders.   The first time I was there I had the pork loin with the mac n' cheese.  After being the last one getting her food by a few minutes, the pork loin = not cooked on the inside.  I told the server and he said, no that is the way that it should look and went on about how they cook it back in the kitchen.  When I showed him the meat...he then said "Oh no!  That isn't how it should be at all!"  Takes my food away.  20 minutes later...new pork loin.  With my waiting (everybody was done by then) not having it done the first done, etc...I should have thought that I would have been compensated for something.  Nope nothing!  Oh! And the server kept on forgetting to refill my iced tea...HUGE pet peeve.  2nd time was last night and my friend and I were sitting at the bar.  We ordered off the happy hour menu with the cheeseburger - no onion (me) and plain Hamburger with nothing on it but grilled onions for my friend.  And we ordered sweet potato fries.  After a half hour (and we had tickets to see Conan in another 45 minutes) our food comes out.  Mine with onions and my friend with cheese and no onions.  Oh, and no sweet potato fries.  We tell the manager the mistake and took our plates away.  We also told the manager and the bartender that we had tickets and had to leave soon.  10 minutes later...our burgers came out again.  Mine was correct, my friend didn't get her grilled onions.  The manager told us that they do not grill onions.  Ooooh-kay!  And still no sweet potato fries.  Uh, where are our fries?  The bartender never put it in the system so the manager made him do that before we could get our fries.   Running late....we scarfed down our food.   At least we were only charged for our iced teas for this catastrophe.  The end!

OMG!!!!  I am not a fan of yogurt at all...but my Oatmeal Cookie mixed with Strawberry was the most amazing dessert ever!  (Well, not ever, but my goodness was this great!!!) What a great way to finish an evening.  I was tired from my workout and just finished a great meal at Bloom when I suggested Yogurt Builderz.  My friend thought I had the most magical idea ever and off we went!  I have friends that swear by this place and go here at least 3 times a week, so I had to try it.  And the prices aren't too shabby either.  And they have a great assortment of toppings...though I do wish they were labeled a little bit better.  And while experiencing this amazing place...my other friends stopped by as well.  One had the Marshmallow with Marshmallow sauce and the other the Devils Food. (Which I did have a sample of...good, but it seemed like it was missing something...probably calories and fat!)   But I heard that they don't have Oatmeal Cookie everyday....:(  I hope it's there the next time I go.

After walking around the Art Fest yesterday, I was needing food....and we found Pure.  I never been to the original location but I loved the set up of this location.   The service was very attentive, though sometimes I thought it was too attentive.  (Our server was obviously new and in ways it was somewhat cute.)  The manager came by with food suggestions...My friend and I realized that we are opposite in tastes...so sharing was going to be out of the question.  She settled on a tuna roll and edamame, which she seemed to enjoy.  I got the Tempura Bento box lunch...which was extremely interesting and yummy.  (the only negative was that it was a bit greasy)  I wished I did take some of the managers suggestions.  I will be here again, that is for sure.

I am so in love...of course minus one thing of course.  I will never be fully satisfied it seems. I went to Ocean Prime for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  I had a reservation for 5 and the service from the start was awesome.  We were in one of the rooms, so we couldn't hear any of the noise from the bar.  The place is well lit and easy to have a conversation with my friends. They started us off with a veggie and relish tray, which I have to say I fell in love with the the cream cheese dip that they had.  And their bread was AMAZING!!!   I ordered the Chop Chop salad which was divine.  My friend Jen had the same thing and just loved it.  We also both ordered a Greyhound (Vodka and Grapefruit) and I loved the fact that the bartender actually squeezed the actual grapefruit.  I now am ruined from any other Greyhound. My other friends ordered French Onion Soup...that looked so yummy, I wished I ordered it. (They both said it was great)  My one friend also ordered the Ravioli and the other two shared the surf and turf appetizer...all said was wonderful.  The only two setbacks that made me not give this place five stars is when our food was served.  Rayna told the waiter French Onion soup first...but was then given the Raviolis.  And when my friends asked the waiter to bring out a candle for my Carrot Cake...somebody else brought it out for us....minus the candle.  (And for the first time tasting Carrot Cake...not bad!!!)  I will back again though....so I can have some French Onion soup with a Greyhound.

I am sorry, but did it say that Blanco serves Mexican food?  This is a disgrace. Lets just start by saying that my experience here was less than mediocre.  I usually find one thing wrong with a place and still give 4 stars.  This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.  (The hostess was the other 10%...very unpleasant...like I was bothering her to get seated....honey that is your JOB!) I met my lovely friend Karla for lunch...she recommended the place and I have been wanting to try it.  We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup to start and I ordered also the enchiladas with green chiles.  The chicken tortilla soup was a catastrophe.  It was made with chicken broth with every vegetable you can think of, chicken, and WHOLE tortillas.  The tortillas were a soggy mess and the soup was just G-d awful.  The server (who was nice) had the manager come over and take it off my bill.  (Which was nice.)  The manager even said that my soup looked very unappetizing.  Next was the enchiladas...first...I didn't know that enchiladas were supposed to be HARD and CRUNCHY!!!  It was greasy, the cheese was flat out disgusting...and they even put my green chiles on the side when I did ask them to put them in the enchiladas. (Which shouldn't be too hard) And on top of everything else, my rice was BUTTERED WHITE RICE!!!!  In a Mexican style Restaurant?  Are you kidding me?  And it was so unappealing...(this meal I had to pay for...)  There was no Mexican flavor or feel at all in this restaurant.  Very displeased and have no desire to ever step foot in there ever again.

What a great way to get introduced to Fogo De Chao  And I thought I would still be full this morning because of all the wonderful food I consumed last night.  (Sorry meal plan, but I had to break a couple rules last night...)  Food, service, atmosphere were all A+!!!!  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The salad bar is AMAZING!!!  And the tour of the kitchen and the private room was a great touch to end the evening.  Thank you Gabi for putting this together!  It was such an excellent treat!

Ok...I just got my ass kicked....for the second time.  The first time was when I had my first session at Karve.  I worked areas on my body that never seen exercise before.  With the mixture of yoga, ballet, pilates, and free weights, you will for sure feel the burn after your one hour class.  I love it that the instructor makes sure that you are doing the exercises correctly...not like other fitness classes that I attended.  The instructor does not frown upon the student when they either need a break or cannot do a certain exercise. Also, I do have issues with my back, and I feel that this type of exercise can definitely build the strength that I need to help.  I just have to build strength in my neck for some of the exercises.  I am still trying to debate if I am going to by a package here. I have issues with my hand that affects me doing some of the challenges.  But they have specials for new clients and discounts for buying classes in packages.  But I do know if I want to get better at this, I have to go more.  Stay tuned.

Love it love it love it love it....  Whenever my friend Rayna and I need to meet for a glass of wine, this is where we go!  I love the ambiance that this place offers...I even like it better than the Arcadia location.  The bartenders are extremely nice and knowledgable with the wines.  (Always impressed with their selection, especially their Malbec and Syrah)   We always get the cheese plate and the variety of Bruschetta.  I do have to admit that I am not thrilled with some of their bruschetta selections lately, especially the Tomato Jam and the White Bean.  But my staples are the Warm Artichoke and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese = YUM!!!)  Parking is eh...you kind of aren't given a choice to valet.  And I have noticed on more than one occasion that the police like to issue tickets to cars parked on the street.  Bathrooms aren't that desirable either...like what Dallas G said...those bathroom doors...

Ok, now I know what prison feels like.  I went there twice already.  The first time wasn't that bad.  The upstairs bar itself (which is what I will be reviewing) is gorgeous...but please tell me who's smart ass idea was to not have the big resort style pool not blocked off is anybody's guess.    I am averaging my 2 times there.  The second time was just obnoxious.  They let my one friend in and refused to let me in.  In fact, I was ignored by security.  I don't know what I said in my fit of rage, but they ended up letting me in.  (I never felt so hopeless getting into a BAR!!!)  My pal and I finally got upstairs...people somehow kept on finding my feet, because I was stepped on at least 10 times.  But that wasn't the bar's fault of course.  This place was the stereotypical prentious hell that I always try to avoid.  If I wasn't meeting a group there, I wouldn't have bothered. (And probably won't ever again)  The bartenders there are morons.  They have no idea how to make a drink.  They ran out of certain liquors.  It was madness.  The funniest thing was a bunch of girls (who are obviously drunk) took of their clothes and jumped in the pool.  Yes, they were escorted out of the hotel.  I swear, somebody is going to fall in one day, completely drunk, and either get injured, killed, or just sue the damn place.  And yes, I could do without the sand.    Ok I am done complaining...next!

The four stars are for you Amber.   You definitely are an amazing salesperson and the only one that actually knew what she was talking about.   I would have put 5 stars....but somethings are lacking...like the other employees that stand there looking stupid when I am obviously there to buy a phone. (Especially when I ask, is there anybody that can help me, I need a new phone)   In comes Amber to save the day.   I am not the easiest customer by a million miles. I am very indecisive and a little bit clueless. Amber was patient and explained things to me in a conversation that I can understand.   But I have to say the funniest thing that happened the other day. I went in since my phone decided to not turn on. (Yes people, the battery was charged) The manager was helping me and another customer. Amber came up and started talking and the other customer said, "Amber! What a cool name) I am not kidding you, the manager gave the customer the Loser sign.   It was hilarious.   Luckily the customer had a sense of humor.

The Parlor is flat out AMAZING!  This was my second time here and this time I played it smart.  I went with 2 friends and we all were having a tough time figuring out what we wanted to eat.  Everything sounded so good.  So we decided to get three entrees and split them all. We ended up with the Margherita Pizza, Pesto Chiatarra, and the Farms Green salad.  The Pesto Chiatarra was by far my favorite, followed by the Farms Green Salad.  (I loved the mixture of Pear, Pecans, Tomatoes, and Gorgonzola)  The pizza...well it was like any other kind of Margherita pizza...but I did love the crust.    I do like it that they have lunch pricing and they don't charge for splitting the dishes.  Our server, Lizzie, was adorable. The layout of the place was nice...though I did see people confused if they went in the other door....they for some reason couldn't see the hostess stand.  And make sure that if you go for lunch...go early!  I couldn't believe the line when we were leaving. Not a great place to go if you only have an hour to spare.  Parking could be a little more favorable and the location is easy to miss.  But this place could easily become one of my favorite places to eat lunch or dinner.  I can't wait to try their desserts next time.

My goal on Saturday night was to stay home and just relax.  I should have listened to that goal.  I have been to the Parlor many times in the past year and always enjoy my food and service. I have to say that my one experience there that I had Saturday night will guarantee that I never step foot in this place ever again.  This isn't something about it being an off night...management proved that they just do not care about their guests.  Around 6 o'clock through Twitter the specials came through for the night.  They had listed a Prime Sirloin with a pesto spread and potatoes and broccolini.  Since my friend Jill and I end up sharing almost the same brain, she texted me immediately that we should go there and try it out.  I was game.  I even called over to the Parlor to ask about the special and if there was a wait.  15 minutes later, at 7 o'clock, Jill and her boyfriend Tony show up and put their names on the waiting list.  About 10 minutes after I showed up we were seated. We sat down and immediately told the server that we wanted 3 specials.  Tony, the server (not be confused with BF Tony) regrettably told us that they were out of the special after I ordered an Iced Tea. Since Jill has Gluten and Dairy allergies, there wasn't anything else she could eat there.  We asked to speak with the manager before we would make up our minds to just leave.  Server Tony asked me if he should hold off on the tea and I told him yes.  (The iced tea is important to this event)  The manager (who I believe her name was Monica...not 100% sure) came up and acted very defensively about running out of the special...even before we had the opportunity to explain our situation.  Jill said that I even called before to make sure about the special and there wasn't anything else she could eat.  Manager excused herself, came back, and stated that they could use a flank steak instead.  We asked what the price would be for that and she said the same price.  For a FLANK STEAK?  That isn't even close to the quality of a Prime Sirloin!  Manager Monica (?) said that she would comp us either drinks or dessert.  We decided to stay...silly people we were.  Server Tony came back, with my iced tea...though I never told him that I wanted it again.  He asked if everything was taken care of.  We said yes and that the manager said that she would comp drinks...so we all ordered glasses of wine.  Tony leaves and then comes back to tell us that Manager Monica told him that she would comp us desserts and $2 off our entree.  Since Jill can't eat the dessert and that wasn't what was discussed, we asked for the manager again.  Enter Eric.  I have to say that I never met a bigger jackass in my life.  He comes up to us and says "My name is Eric and the Parlor is considered my place.  As we make specials, you have to understand that it isn't an exact science.  Sometimes we run out of things."  Fine we get that.  I told him that the not having a special is now a moot point since his manager offered us something that she is now reneging on. He faces me and says "Have you ever worked in a high stressed environment before?  Sometimes we say things that we just think about then."  I told him that "Yes I have worked in a high volume stressed workplace before and as a manager I honor what comes out of my mouth."  I am sorry, but if you can't trust your manager with making decisions in a "high stressed" environment then you need to rethink your staff.  He then back pedaled and said that he would comp the whole bill for us if that is what we wanted.  We told him we weren't looking for a free meal, but ok.  Food came and he left.   Well, of course, the flank steak (cooked medium rare) what not up to par and very tough. The broccolini had absolutely no flavor.  The potatoes were great though.    Of course this isn't the end of the story.  The bill came and I am not shitting you....the only thing on the bill was my iced tea.  After all of that, you couldn't comp my iced tea along with everything else? We should have left then, because a few minutes later the server came back and told us that he handed us the wrong bill.  The correct bill was drinks comped, 3 entrees for $12 and still my iced tea.  (Yes this is a big deal to me)  We couldn't believe it.    If a restaurant is not prepared for a special for Saturday night (a high volume day) then you shouldn't even offer a special.  As a friend said to me today, this is a pizza joint and they should just stick to pizza and not offer these other specials just to get us in.   Customer service comes a long way especially in our economy.  I will be willing to pay for good food and good service.  The Parlor proved that they have neither.

I will give them one more star...I actually dared to go back with my friend Jen a couple of weeks ago.  My luck: I got the same waiter.  My hair looked completely different, so you should have seen my shock that he actually remembered me. (And made a joke about giving me the correct check this time)  The one more star is for Tony the Waiter for being super cool....and not poisoning me.

I am on a roll when it comes to trying new (well to me anyway) cuisine across the Valley. Today at work, my coworker and wonderful friend Vicky mentioned how she wanted to try Kareys Kitchen. I went on Yelp, read the reviews (especially from people that I really trusted) and I couldn't wait to go.   Walking in there (remind me please to always check the website and menu before I go into the unknown!) I was highly confused on what to order. The words Chicken, Beef, and Pork rang a bell to me, but not the words Caldereta, Tinola, and Asado. One of the owners, the ever helpful and super sweet Rey (the wife's name is Karen - hence the name Kareys Kitchen) let me try three sample tastes. The Chicken Adobo and the Beef Caldereta were amazing, but I ended up getting the Chicken Coconut Curry with steamed rice. The curry wasn't overbearing at all...in fact it was made just right.   Vicky order the 2 combination plate of Dinuguan and Pinakbet with steamed rice. (And let me tell you that you will never go hungry with the amount of rice that they serve!) I tried the Dinuguan...it was alright to me...but I am not a big pork fan. She loved it, though she was used to more of a spicier taste (Though the Pinakbet had bitter melon in it - ewww not a good after taste)   I also ordered a piece of their Cassava cake...but I was so full I only at a couple of bites. I took the rest home with me...what I had it was really good.   I am scared about when the word of mouth becomes so widespread that this place will get so crowded that it will start to become annoying to go there. Basically, the cafe is very small...cozy for now...

OMG!  I am so impressed with this place, from service to the food, to the atmopshere....I couldn't get enough!  The Union Salad (shrimp, bacon, green beans, tomatoes - no lettuce, with a vinegerette dressing) was out of this world.  The Oysters were to die for.  The drinks were terrific.  (I had this cherry cordial drink that was yummy).  The service was impeccable.  The servers were on top of everything.  And the atmosphere?  Amazing!

I have never been so disappointed in my life!  I have been waiting FOREVER to go back to Union in Vegas....just for the Union Salad alone!  But I also loved the ambiance and service that I felt they offered in a stellar way. Well, to my dismay, I may just never go back after what I experienced.  My mom and I were sitting in the bar/lounge area waiting to be served.  My mom was the first to notice that are server had a bit of an attitude...which I didn't really noticed until it took over a half hour to have her come back so we could ask WHERE THE FOOD WAS!!!  She asked how everything was, and I asked her where my oysters, salad and my mom's food was.  Yes we didn't order a bunch of expensive items, but we should be treated with respect!  12/27/11 - Ok so I waited awhile to complete this review.  I was so friggin' angry when I started to right this.  I am still angry and I won't be back.  The end of the story was that our server never came back and we had to get two managers to get our food.  And it isn't like we wanted to have anything comped....but this is Vegas and this is also a high end restaurant.  The managers didn't even come back to check on us after we got served.  The server ended up coming back in the end to just hand us our check.  No apology...nothing.  Highly disappointed.  (And I am not high maintenance...I just am a big believer in customer service)

I don't know why I have waited so long to write my review for John and Space Massage Studio.  I believe I have gone to John since he opened a couple of years ago...and I never wrote a review.  I am a bit ashamed....but I think I have a really good reason (or two)  I tell all of my friends that they need to go to John...but when it comes to why they should...there is so much into why that I didn't know how I could parlay it into words.   Over the years John has become more than a massage therapist to me....he has become somebody that gives great advice and actually listens to what I have to say.  And because he listens...my massages are always customed to what I NEED!  Not what I want...not a massage that you can get anywhere.  Example last week when I got my bazillionith massage from John.  I mentioned to him that my job requires that I now where high heels....he knew that while my back was messed up he knew that my feet and lower part of my legs needed added extra attention.  Just through conversation he knew what I needed.  And to me this is the most important thing I need from a massage therapist (or any therapist!!! HA!)  John is so attentive and really really really does give the most amazing massages in the universe!    I am happy that my schedule is more flexible so I can make the time to see John and Space Massage Studio.

You know, maybe I am a diva or I just expect too much.  But when I get the worst possible service known to anybody, I don't care how good your pizza tastes. I go to Slices from time to time to get my pizza fix.  I always thought that they have great pizza and I love the different varieties that they have.  But I may never go back...ever...  So I am in line waiting to be served.  (And when I say waiting, I mean at least 5 minutes with one girl staring at me while she is putting together boxes. )  Finally this guy came up and asked me what I wanted and I said the Tomato Basil and then asked him what pizzas just came out of the oven.  He told me and I said that I would also like a piece of Pepperoni and Mushroom.    I get to the counter and there is only the tomato basil waiting for me.  The girl (who loves her boxes) looked at me and I told her that I also ordered a Pepperoni and Mushroom.  She asked the guy and he said "I don't remember anything"  Ok, whatever.  So he gets a slice.  While I am waiting for that to warm, I told the girl that this was to go.  I am not kidding you she handed me a box and told me to put my pizza in the box.  (The two guys before got theirs boxed for them)  This place, especially the counter, is very small and I don't think it would hurt her to do some customer service and box my pizza.    I am now irritated writing this review.

I had to take a couple of hours to calm down to write this review.  I have never been so annoyed in my life.  I usually go to the Starbucks on 16th St...but they don't have a drive thru.  The one on Thomas/32st has the worst service, so I decided to the 44th St location today.  I was craving a Roasted Pepper Panini today real bad.  I get up to the drive-thru to order my panini   "No, you caaaaaaaaan't haaaaave that! I am soooooo sorrrrrrrrrryyyyyy.  We have been waiting for a new order to come in."  "Oh...well, do you have any other paninis?"  Instead of her answering, she said "You will have to stay in the drive thru line, but it doesn't look like it's that long"  Great...now I am stuck in a drive thru line that I can't get out of.  I was held hostage.  There wasn't anything else I wanted.  So I had to wait 20 mintues to get out of the drive thru.    Funny thing, the person in front of me got a coupon for a free drink because they were out of what they ordered as well.  I, of course, got nothing.

I am finally becoming a "yogi"  Many many years I have had friends try to get me to get into yoga.  I have tried them all, and I never got into the groove.  I didn't get it.  I never could get relaxed, get into that zone, or just overall enjoyed it.  Then my friend Tiffany asked me to go with her to Sumits Yoga.  I never liked "hot yoga"...I just thought it was disgusting.  And I always wanted to pass out after 5 minutes of getting there.  But I was so wrong!  I can't get enough of it!  I actually look forward going there after work.  I love the sweat, I love the flow, I love everything about it.  The instructors are amazing...and I love it that they don't do the yoga with you.  They talk you through it instead.  And they help you get flexible.  I am actually sad I can't go tomorrow.  :)

i heart this place.  They know about injuries and the right thing to do to make you feel all better.  My therapist Suzy is very personable and does a great job multi-tasking between patients. One of the assistants, Dylan is also amazing.  Great sense of humor and knows his stuff.  Actually teaches me how to do the exercises properly. I just wish I didn't have  a $40 co-pay, but that isn't their fault. Also, make sure that you are paying attention when they give you an ultrasound.  No names mentioned (basically because I can't remember his name) but one time my skin felt like it was on fire because he couldn't move the ultrasound thingy and ask me a question at the same time.

Definitely not a place that I would jump off my seat to try...but that is because I thought that it didn't cater to my palette :)  I went to Nourish yesterday for an event at lunch.  I wish that this place was easier to find...because I think that they would have a bigger clientele if they did.  Completely hidden....if I didn't valet I never would have found it.  Like I said, I am not a big fan of places like this...the healthy food establishment.  But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the potato and bacon soup that was really good, though I have to say it didn't look appetizing.  Lots of bacon!  I then had the salmon burger for my entree....interesting that it didn't come with a bun.  I really liked the burger itself...though was not a fan of the eggless coconut mayo that they had.  And the sweet potato fries that came with were very tasty.  (And the sauce that came with it was actually top notch!)  My only other complaint is the service.  While the servers were on top of everything...isn't it possible to do it with a smile on their faces?

After many attempts of having restaurants succeed on the corner of 16th and Campbell (people seem to think that the whole building is an autobody shop) I hope that Joe's works out.  I went there for the first time on Saturday...just decided to walk over and try them out.  Had eggs, bacon, and one pancake.  Everything was made delicious...and I have to highly recommend the pancakes!  I came back on Sunday to just have them again!    The owner, Joe and his wife Joan (I had to make fun of that...good sports) are very personable and full of excitement for their new venture.  Joe has stories behind each one of his dishes.  It was endearing.  The only thing that they have to work on is there service before you order and after. (During they are great!) It could take awhile for you to be noticed to be either seated or for you to order your food.  And getting your check? Make sure you ask for it during your meal.  You may just get it on time.

I was just treated like royalty....  I couldn't wait to write this review for Alchemy, I was so impressed.  The service was impeccable (excellent kudos to our server Jean), the view was awesome (I can't wait to come here during the day so I can take in what is obvious a breathtaking view), and the food was too die for.  Lets start from the beginning.  My friend Jodi and I walk in to the Copperwynd Resort.  (We did lose our way at first and walked through the pool/gym/spa area.  Seeing this with the views make me - and my friend agreed -  want to stay for a spa weekend.  I think we are going to set this up soon!) Nestled in Fountain Hills, this place is a hidden gem.  I understand how the locals may want to keep this place a secret, but it needs to experienced by everyone. I understand this place was closed for a few months...but Alchemy is back!  Our charming hostess sat us in what seemed to be the best seat in the house.  We were by the window and, while it was dark, you can see the lights of what was just an amazing view.    The wine list was extensive and it was tough to chose what I wanted to drink.  I chose what was a very delicious Riesling.    Now, when you make your reservations to have the most amazing dining experience, please make sure that you request Jean (or John - I am assuming it is spelled Jean since he had the most endearing French accent - though one should never assume :)) to be your server.  He made the whole night an event.  He had the best sense of humor and was very attentive.  (And if he is unavailable, there was another server, Jenny who was also very helpful throughout the night)   Now lets get to the food!  The manager did recommend to us that we needed to try the braised short rib crostini  to start.  Now I am one that will not eat onions....but as it was described to us...it was true:  This dish was a "party in my mouth".  The pork rib was cooked just right and it melted in my mouth with the goat cheese and grilled onions.  (I didn't realize that there were onions until afterwards.)   Next my friend and I split the Iceberg Chopped Salad.  Now...this may be the strangest thing I may ever say...but this was the most delicious salad I ever had!  The lettuce was just like butter...with bacon, goat cheese (Jodi and I requested goat cheese in lieu of the bleu cheese since we are not fans) avocado (again - I don't eat avocados - but I didn't care!  It was THAT GOOD!) and the perfect buttermilk ranch dressing.  I was a fan!  Jodi ordered one of the specials of the night - the Dover Sole stuffed with blue crab.  I had the pan seared halibut with a creamy corn chowder.  We both raved about both dishes.  Cooked to perfection!    While we were waiting for our desserts (where I was going to find room for this, I wasn't sure) Chef Paul came out to introduce himself.  A very charming man who definitely knew his stuff.  It was such a great added touch to an already memorable experience.    Jean came out with our desserts.  Now we were in heaven!  The flourless chocolate cake was melt in my mouth scrumptious...but I had this thing for this white chocolate cake that was out of this world!!!  While I am proud that I didn't over stuff myself by finishing the cake...there is a part of me that wished I did.  From beginning to end, the experience at Alchemy was top notch!  Prices were very reasonable, the food and views are just to die for, and I can't stop talking about the best service I had received.  (Remember - Jean or Jenny!!!)  I can't wait to go back - especially for lunch to enjoy the views!  And you need to go there as well to check it out.  Don't worry about the drive....this place is worth it!

I just went there again over the weekend for another spectacular experience.  I really do love this place and more people need to go out there as well!  It was extremely busy Saturday night and the staff handled it with ease.    I need to give a special shout out to Alchemy's manager.  Ryan is extremely professional and made the experience that much more enjoyable.  He loves to engage with his clientele and being extremely helpful at the same time.  He really cares about the restaurant and staff.    It's great to see a place where it is obvious that the staff enjoys where they work.  We had Jean again for our server...and his humor and knowledge is great.    The only thing I wish is that the wine list had more to offer by the glass. There are many different wines available by the bottle....but for this lightweight...one glass is fine for me.  And when you stop in...make sure you make room for dessert.  The goat cheese cake was out of this world.

I don't know what I could say that hasn't already been said, but this is one of my 3 go to places for brunch on the weekends.  I totally love it here and the staff always makes you feel so welcome!  The drinks alone are fantastic.  (Can I have the NO.2, please!) and they have great deals for brunch on the weekends.  Their Bloody Mary bar is the best with a great variety to mix in (and who really needs to eat after all of those olives!)  If you go for brunch, it is a MUST to experience their zucchini bread.  My friends tried mine yesterday, and they ended up stealing the whole thing from me!  HA!  And I also decided not to get the rest of the brunch yesterday and actually get a burger.  I got the Windsor style, and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I ever had!  I was totally impressed!  So do yourself a favor, even if you have to travel a bit to get there, and experience the wonderness of the Windsor! :)

I admit it, I love Mood Swings.  I went to so many salons this past year trying to find the perfect stylist that can fix my curly disaster that I have...and I finally found her.  I remember going to Mood Swings 8 years ago, so I decided to try it again.  I was recommended to try Shelby, and besides fixing my hair that I now can wear curly again, she also did a wonderful job fixing the color also.  With that and the fact that they do a great neck massage and hand massage while you are getting your hair washed makes for an awesome added treat.

First buckeye is hell. Second, when I did walk in the server did say for me to sit anywhere I wanted..and all but one table was dirty. 3rd I couldn't tell you anything about the food because I was sitting there for 10 minutes without anybody asking me for even a drink order or to give me a menu. I walked out...

Could I tell you anything about the fitness experience at YouFit?  I would if I could, but my friend and I didn't get that far in the process.  I walked in and the guy at the counter offered to show us around since I explained that I would like to check the gym out.  I swear that this guy was on drugs with the way he was talking and his sudden ADD movements that he was experiencing.  And he had his back turned to us the whole time, so I couldn't even hear a word that he said.  We asked if we could get a session to try the gym out and said that we would have to pay $10 for a guest pass.  Really???  The Village even offers a 7 day free  pass to make sure I like it before I would sign up. He then said his boss would kill him for saying this, but if we went online, we could get a free pass.  What????  The fees are ridiculous, and with the way this guy was acting, we definitely didn't feel comfortable giving our information out.  When we were going through the process of payment, the YouFit associate then said, "Oops, there is another fee. It's for maintenance."  My friend and I looked at one another and left.  This was not the place for us.

Did you know that Marky Mark is the same person as Mark Wahlberg?  And why did I mention this?  Because that is what the three workers (one I know was a manager) were debating about while I was waiting for my sandwich...and sandwich that was waiting to be handed to me.  Five minutes later....my name was called....another employee gave it to me...while the three guys were still talking about Marky Mark.    I was told that I had to go to this "amazing sandwich"...the best sandwich in America.  Well...service wise...this place is awful.  The guy taking my order had severe ADD...(would you like a drink with that?  "No thank you"...ok would you like a regular or large drink?  Or!  "What is the total?"  Moron behind the counter..."The cookie is $1.29)  Food wise?  There was nothing...absolutely NOTHING about that sandwich (Chicken Cheesesteak)  that would make me forget about the bad counter service so I would go back.  The chicken was bland and extremely greasy.  I am still feeling the effects of the pit in my stomach of bottomless grease.  Sorry Caprioti's....not going back.

I wish I was a beer drinker.  But alas, I am not.  But the people that I was with on Friday were and they had nothing but great things to say about the beer selection. I had cider...which really doesn't tell you much.  But I did try their sangria and I really wasn't impressed.    It was pretty awesome that the owner, John, came up and chatted with us for a good half hour about the restaurant.  It has only been open for 6 weeks and they are trying different things with the menu.  The micro brewery won't be up and running for another 6-9 months, but the beers that they had were from breweries local and from the western side of the country.  He also let my two friends try different types of beer to see what they would like.  I only heard amazing things about the White Chocolate beer that they had.  He also explained to me why I may had not like the sangria, which was also interesting.    I did not have anything to eat while I was there, but I had to say that the ribs that our neighbors at the next table were having smelled AMAZING!  (I am not a BBQ person by any means, so that to me was a big plus)   My friend and I both commented that we had to try this place since we drove by it so many times.  I can't wait to go back and try the food...and update the review! :)

I am here all the time...so much that I know that they know me well. (If that is a good thing since I make them pick out the onions...only green peppers)  I order the same thing everytime (Chicken burrito bowl)  and it always tastes the same....super yummy!  For the most part, customer service is great, even the newbies that work there are great (even though they can't fold a tortilla)....but I always seem to ask them to put more rice in my bowl....but they have no problem giving me a crapload of beans.

About a month ago, I started the juicing trend.  I wish I had the time to make all of my favorite juices, but I don't.  So when I work in Scottsdale, the go to place for me is grabbagreen.  I find their juices and smoothies to be very tasty....so much so that it is hard for me to have a processed juice from any store.  They are fresh and they don't have preservatives, which I find actually refreshing.  I am so happy that there is a place like this in my vicinity.  I can't even complain about the prices.  A little high?  Maybe, but it is a meal that you are having.  (And they have great rice and quinoa meals as well, btw)  My only complaint is the customer service.  They need to have more knowledgeable employees.  And I have been in there many times in the past and not once was I offered a punch card....I didn't even know that they had one until this past week.  I could have gotten a free smoothies 3 times over if I was told about this before.

Finally an AUTHENTIC Detroit CONEY restaurant in Arizona.    After I left Michigan back in 2005, I thought that I would never have this experience ever again, unless I went home to visit.  But Detroit Coney brought the actual Coney experience to me....and I couldn't be happier.  The Hani is exactly how I remember it...and the chili is the real thing!  (I may be wrong, but I think they ship it in from Detroit....)   The best part, besides the food....is that I am with all of my Michigan peeps when I am there.  There is always somebody to gossip with about Michigan....and in the end it comes to be known that we either know each other or we know the same people.  It is so much fun.  Do NOT go to any other places in AZ that claim to be a Coney Restaurant.  They aren't.  You need the Middle Eastern flair along with it, btw.  And bring your non-MI friends....they will thank you forever for it.

Well! I finally got a chance to go back last night! Service was impeccable...and probably had some of the best food I ever had! The quinoa tacos were amazing! The kale salad was out of this world! And why not top off the  "healthy" meal I had with the most awesome, the most spectacular bread pudding I ever put in my mouth??? Well done The Henry...well done!

This place is so cool...and the people who work there are awesome.  I came in today to look for a Camelback (some people are not talented enough to ride and drink at the same time)  They explained to me that I would be dependent on the thing and actually talked me out of the purchase.  The sales guy even said "I can't believe I am going to talk you out of a sale..."  He told me about these great water bottles instead...which I do own.  I think I need to practice with the water bottles more. While I am a Tribe girl at heart...Kevin at Tribe actually told me to go there...if I needed an alternative place to go, I would pick them in a second.  And I thought that the store was really cool.  Very laid back and they didn't make me feel like an idiot.
