I guess I'll join the bandwagon and give it a 4 star. We had the local greens balsamic salad, the lasagna, and the wise guy pizza. I'm giving it a 4 star because the food is good and the service we received was GREAT! Personally though, it's overpriced. We probably won't be back. There are other places with similar menu items that are just as good that are less expensive. But a good first experience!

Food was good, but service wasn't comparable. The alcoholic drinks took a long time and the margarita was too thick (hadn't melted the entire time we were there), then the Bloody Mary was "eh" & I never got my extra olives. Seemed like they were under-staffed for the lunch crowd. No one appeared happy; they were polite, but not much enthusiasm.  Probably won't go back.

The reason I'm giving them a low score is because of the horrible phone service. Tried calling ahead - it rang for literally 3 minutes so he could put me on hold for 9 minutes and so I finally gave up and hung up. When I got here 1 person in line (ahead of me). Yes there were people waiting for their to go orders but I would think with the amount of time they've had of being a popular restaurant & being opened for business that they would have come up with a designated person or better phone order system. Not only that - the place needs a serious renovation. With the amount of money (multiple locations) I'm pretty sure they could afford to do a little at a time because it's seriously needed.  The food though, is pretty damn good. I'm not a big fan of their rice or beans. I usually come for the buttered tortilla, chorizo & egg burrito & my husband gets the machaca, egg & bean burrito.

Ok. Let's see. I got the white tip with gel & I'm pretty happy! If you want something simple with no designs or have time for the frills then I def recommend this place. However I was a little put off from the cleanliness & dated decor, but the work done by Tom is Great. My nails weren't too thick and they look natural for sure. From my time here, looked like they service the older crowd mostly which is why I'm assuming they don't have design options or many colors. Pretty basic colors so again if you need a simple nail look and prefer quality over being rushed & pushed to add on services then I recommend this spot. I'm pretty sure I'll be back, thank you to my MIL!

I have to first start out by saying  that tonight was the first time since being in the old building that the service was exceptional. We stopped Coming BECAUSE the service became so $hitty, but they have redeemed themselves tonight. Bianca was on point with our order and the manager was attentive and polite when checking on us. The Mac and cheese must have gone they some type of revival recipe because it's better than the last time I remember ordering it. Should have ordered the greens to see if the flavor has improved too. Husband had the toy toy & I had the Betty boop. Both were cooked perfectly and our plates reflected our satisfaction as we didn't need a to-go box since there wasn't anything to take home. I did notice that the waffle size has changed in size - it's a lot smaller and thinner but still tasty. We just make come back again!

It was ok I guess. I had the huevos rancheros, hubby had the traditional breakfast.  For me - the beans tasted like canned beans, the tortilla tasted store bought like mission tortillas & the chorizo was a tablespoon so more beans than anything. My over-easy eggs, sliced avocados & potatoes were probably the only thing fresh. Oh, and the pico de gallo was pretty good. So overall it was alright for the amount of serving you get & $. If you're starving it'll fill you up. Most likely won't visit again. Husband said it was bland but did the job (after adding salt, pepper & hot sauce) since he was starving.  Apart from the food, the service surpassed the food! :)

So we didn't check the time and showed up 30 min before close. They still sat us thankfully!  I ordered the rotisserie rib eye and husband ordered the filet - both came with mash potatoes and veggies. Husband loved his dish! And well, I Loved my sides! The rib eye was very tender and juicy, but a tad bit bland. The filet def had more flavor/seasoning than my rib eye. Maybe it was because we showed up so close to close of business? Idk - I didn't finish my plate - it was a huge serving! :) I just took it home and will most likely doctor it up and eat it up! I'm really looking forward to the veggie though. If I remember correctly the waitress said it was asparagus, bok Choy, and a whole leek. It was just delish. :) our waitress was great! Very personable and made the night that much more pleasant.

Ordered "the original" w/jalape√±os - $10! Not even a combo. Only ate half. It was filling - but is the taste/quality worth the money? Nope. I'm assuming it has to do with location. The look of the pizza was not appetizing. The cheese looked dry which is one of the reasons I didn't order it. The inside was clean & organized so I appreciated that!

I've been going to laser for less for about 6 years - not because It doesn't work but because of life, so when I do find the time to get lasered I choose them! I live in south Phoenix so it is a drive that's well worth making. The staff have always been friendly with a great sense of humor so it makes the experience more enjoyable and makes the short amount of  time fly by. I'm not great with pain but that's just me. My niece didn't experience pain she just trucked through it so it's clearly different for everyone, so it's not bad to where you won't go back regardless of pain tolerance. I've never had an issue with cost, hours, staff, and clearly no issue with distance (I live about 15 miles away). This is the place to go to!

Love this place! My hubby heard abt this place thru yelp & When I first saw the location, it didn't necessarily have the best curb appeal. However, the decor and intimate size of the dining area makes up for it; especially the food. I've had the pepperoni and the margarita pizza, and we've had the lasagna & shrimp pasta dish. No complaints whatsoever. :) the appetizer, bruschetta is Delish. I guess what I'm implying is that I haven't been disappointed!  I personally prefer their pizza over pizza bianco.

Goodness sakes. The drive-thru time is the WORST! I've been sitting in the same spot for the last 3 minutes, but that doesn't include the 11 minutes that I've already spent in line. The worst part is that once you're in line, you're in line. There's no way to change your mind because you're blocked in. The window guy was pleasant. No apology for the long wait. I wished there would be a limit on "substitutions" on their drinks. Maybe it would help with the coffee making time. So far it's been 5 minutes since I gave my order.... 1 flat white - grande. ............................... 9 minutes to get my drink. Poor lady ahead of me wasted her time talking to the manager and all she did was apologize. Didn't even offer her drinks to be free.  So I just spent 30 minutes in the drive-thru for one cup of coffee. Never again.

Tacos were definitely a decent size - green salsa was flavorful. I had the grilled fish and fried fish tacos. Super delicious and worth going back. Prices were just as good and reasonable unlike other "taco" places in the area. Can't wait to visit their other locations :)

Disappointed is a word I've never had to use at this restaurant. The bar area is always clean - the bartenders are always friendly and know when you're in a chatty or solo mood.  Spinach salad, all their soups, BBQ pizza, spicy salsiccia pizza (sp check), and kids menu is delish. Their service is always quality and is greatly appreciated! The patio is perfect and the entire place simply has a great vibe to it. Definitely a favorite!

as recommended by many on Yelp we tried the soft pretzels fondue... and it was a success!  definitely need to limit yourself so you don't get too full before your meal.  the menu has a little bit of everything, but not overwhelming. the only hard thing is deciding what sounds better! we tried the pastrami sandwich and the chef salad. both are DELISH! I'm not a big pastrami person because it has a distinct taste to it, but this one was definitely an exception. it wasn't dry and it didn't have a weird after taste. it had you wanting more.  the chef salad that was recommended by our waitress & it was definitely a great choice. it wasn't the usual boring chef salad - the taste was different & the dressing didn't taste store bought.... i could be wrong....but the ingredients all together worked perfectly. the quality of the ingredients made a difference. I'm a carboholic - and the sandwich was definitely worth having, but i think the salad for me is worth having again.  we'll be back and our next objective is to tackle the fried chicken.... until next time culinary dropout, until next time....

Had the Pho Mignon and it hit the spot for this cold weather! Ordered the large because the prix and size makes more sense. Also had the edamame and it was seasoned just right! Our server was a bit slow but the bus girl made up for it. Overall, it was a good experience :)

I trusted fellow yelpers and am so happy that I did! The price was super reasonable and my dress fit perfect! My mother-in-law also had her dress altered and she looked amazing in her dress! We ordered her dress online & it needed a lot of work. The service was great & the quality of work was great. The only hiccup is that one of the pins was sewn/caught inside the dress making it dangerous if she would have stepped on it. Thankfully my bridesmaids caught it while steaming the dress (final touches) & carefully removed it without ripping the hemming too much. Only reason for the 4 out of 5 - I will def recommend her if anyone asks!

Definitely a great place to go to! Patio is perfect especially for the type of weather we've been having lately. I had the pulled pork, husband had the burger and cheese, 3 yr old had the chicken tenders. Also tried one of their low hop beers. We were all happy that we didn't even feel the desire to try one another's order lol the fries too! They were crunchy throughout and didn't get soggy or hard. My pulled pork had just the right amount of spicy and even though it was really juicy, the bread that it was on served on soaked it up to where the taste of the bread and juice made it even more of a 10!  The burger was flavorful as opposed to places where the patty isn't seasoned enough. The sauce was just the right amount and gave it that extra kick while still keeping that hint of ketchup.  Needless to say we finished everything on our plates and the portions were huge. Reasonable price and service was great! We'll be back for sure!

What a great little place! it's tucked in the corner, small and very quaint. the decor is very trendy and homey at the same time. very romantic at night, but still gives a family setting.  Dinner was delicious! bread/butter - amazing appetizer - grilled zucchini, savory entree - it was a crepe type of dish with cheese and spinach in the center. the BEST fresh flavor. side of meatballs - cannot come to this place without having them!!! so tasty, lots of flavor.  the waitstaff was very attentive and one of the owners came to our table as well. she definitely gave us a "we're at home feeling" which had us feeling "we love you nonna!"  food was great + service was great = total experience was exceptional

where to start......   the service is absolutely wonderful. no complaints there! not that there is really anything to really complain about. the food is good and the atmosphere is very trendy. even though it's a casual place - it's a dressed up kind of casual place. women will definitely feel under dressed if they're not wearing a skirt/dress or dressy blouse with their jeans & heels.  anyway - the food was good. we tried the ahi tuna tacos for the appetizer & it was tasty! first time i've had them and I was content. the filet was next as well as the steakhouse salad. both were pretty good.  i think the downfall for us is that the food was good, but not GREAT for the price. seemed a little over priced for what we ordered. if we go back it'll most likely be for drinks & the ambience.

Nachos, wings, French dip, burnt tips, Mac & Cheese, and cream of corn is what we ordered. The nachos looked good but it was too salty even with the BBQ sauce. Wings were mediocre, French dip wasn't tender like other French dips I've had. It does the job if you're starving. The burnt tips had too much grease - we literally poured it out onto a separate plate. The meat was tough and the fat was probably the best part of the taste. Cream of corn was too watery and hardly any corn in it. The Mac and cheese tastes like Kraft. The best part of our visit was our server/bartender. He was friendly, great sense of humor, attentive, and on top of it. So kudos to him! He gets our 5 stars :)

I normally order the Mexican Benedict and my husband gets the Wilcox Avenue but today we tried to other items! They sure didn't disappoint! I had the biscuits and gravy w/scrambled eggs & my husband ordered the pain Perdu. We wanted something sweet and salty so perfect pair to share. The gravy is simply perfect - full of flavor, bits of meat in it and not overly salty. The Perdu had a subtle sweetness compared to French toast (my next item to try). Needless to say we finished both plates!

I should have read some reviews before because I am disappointed in the fact that I paid $12 for a damn steak burrito and a side of guac. Which I had to add salt to. Food was meh. I guess I expected it to have some boldness to it. It's was okay. I'd come back if it was in the $5-$7 range, but definitely not $12!

Will definitely be coming back!  I had the roasted tomatillo chicken enchiladas w/red sauce & my husband had the pork w/green sauce - we both added an over-easy egg on top of all our fixings - NO complaints here! So fresh! We even tried their cocktails, mimosa & grapefruit margarita - fresh, crisp & amazing!

Came for lunch and had an adult beverage with the wings & salad special. As soon as I got to the bar, I could smell the bar. Seriously gross so I moved to the far end of the bar and still smelled. Similar to moldy wet rags/water. Definitely needs a good cleaning (bleach!)! The wings were fine, the house salad - supposed to be super simple - it was alright, wasn't a fan of the oregano seasoning on it, but ate it because I was hungry. Service was great - she was on top of it. The smell is what had me questioning the cleanliness of my cups & counter.

We definitely love coming here! We come about once or twice a year though. We had the bone in filet, creamed spinach & Mac & cheese. Couple of cocktails - Moscow mule & Pinot noir for me. Our food was great! And when they say that the medium is a little raw in the center they mean it! But I'm okay with it so no complaints because the plate was so damn hot that all I had to do was cut a piece lay it back on the plate and it'll cook the piece to well done lol I'll have to say the only thing I didn't care for was the mac & cheese and mostly because the plate was so hot that it kind of cooked it more and it turned oily rather than stay creamy. The service was great and it was noticeable that it was a well oiled machine haha so good job to everyone! We were in & out within 40 minutes. Guess it helped that we knew what we were ordering before we got there.  Oh and just one thing that I'd like to see is the Bravo feature to tip the valet guys

My family makes this spot our weekly Thursday night dinner. Pizza! It's simply delicious! Yup, just that simple. The crust is thin - our order is normally done within 5 minutes and we've never been disappointed. We normally get the salscicca (spell check) or don Alfonso and it's never bland or soggy. We recently ordered the Calzone and still as delicious. We haven't had anything as of yet that we didn't like on their menu. We have been Thursday night regulars for about 6 months now.... We love  pizza (clearly lol) and are always willing to try new places and still this spot tops our list.

Geezus I wish I would have looked at the reviews first! This TINY burrito just cost me $7! I asked the size and she Did say 7" but there is hardly anything in it! It might as well be called a rolled taco! SMDH I should have toughed out the line at Chipotle!! This is ridiculous.  The guac in the carne asada burrito is okay. The salsa that comes with it is okay. The tortilla is pretty good - thank goodness it's not chewy like mission tortillas, but it could have been cooked longer or warmed up at the very least. Burrito wasn't even hot, much less warm. The meat had good flavor to it... Still WAY over priced for the amount/size of a cold burrito.   Came in starving, left hungry.

First I want to say that I may come back and revise this review because I'm pregnant so I won't be reviewing the alcohol, but the food.... I had the AZ trail burger with onion rings. My husband the same but with fries & daughter had the quesadilla with fruit. The buns were pretzel buns & smaller than the patties. It wasn't soft like I've had at other locations and the patties were bland. I feel like they depended on the drizzle of the sauce to give the rest of the ingredients flavor. It had a bit of spice to it & it was good but the bun not being so soft and the party being a bit bland the bacon & sauce weren't enough. The onion ring had an okay taste to the batter but I guess I was expecting crispy since it looked like it would be, but it was soft. Not soggy so there's potential in it.  Fruit was good and sliced perfectly for my 3 year old. The quesadilla was okay. The cheese was melted through and the tortilla tasted & looked like a mission tortilla. I don't blame her for not wanting to eat more than 1 slice. The food wasn't Bad - it just isn't impressive. It does the job... Maybe we'll be back once I can try the beer.

My husband and I were so looking forward to our usual orders, being that we haven't been here in a month. I order the Vig Dip and he orders the VigAz burger. To our surprise they have changed the menu. To my husband's disappointment they no longer have the VigAz burger on the menu. The server did a great job attempting to  make up for it by suggesting to add bacon & arugula. Too bad that they didn't add the arugula (just the ice berg) and they forgot the bacon. The server brought out a side of bacon, but needless to say it just wasn't the same. Oh and they took the Rulemule (Moscow mule) off too. :( I was relieved that they still had my vig dip! But *gasp* I didn't notice that they changed how it's made. Ugh. The pretzel bun is so much more tastier, now they have some type of a wheat roll, they took out the delicious havarti cheese for something else that only adds to the blandness of the meat. The Aujus is just as disappointing because it tasted like watered down soy sauce. Luckily the fries were left untouched but it doesn't make up for the meal.  We MAY come back just for drinks but our family dinners will most likely be elsewhere..our last memory this meal - we still spent $50 for a meal that we didn't really like. But that's what you do when you're Hangry, you just eat.

I'm giving it a 5 star because of the bartender, Jeska. Super nice, friendly, great humor, and great service! Ordered the Picasso salad (which came out fast! *thumbs up*) - tried ordering a small but it was freakin huge! Def enough for 3 people! I hate to waste food so def worth the $ (not that it's a lot) because of the size - it's more than enough to fill you up. However, I would still prefer a smaller size at least for a lunch time special - I would probably visit more often. Ordered a kiltlifter and it was ICY cold just the way a beer should be! First time to this location and have to say I prefer it over the Tempe location....  So, great job Jeska & kitchen staff for the great service! Kudos to you for making my experience top notch!

Mexican chopped salad w/grilled Chicken = yummmm! I love roasted corn so maybe a little bias ;) but mix of everything was pretty good! Only 2 things I would change if I could: 1) make the tortilla strips shorter - I felt that they were having a fight with my mouth & face lol 2) I'll more than likely ask for jalape√±os next time. Needs a bit more of that kick/salty taste.  Overall tho, I'll definitely be back! Super clean, friendly staff including bartender. Outside patio is somewhat small but still great to be sitting at. They have misters so helps keep the inside cool air flowing.

We came to try the tacos, but they messed up our appetizer order so to correct the order we kept the carnitas nachos and they still gave us the carne asada nachos. Soooo we got too full to order anything else. We'll have to come back for the tacos because I'm confident they'll be as delicious as the nachos were! Both dishes were flavorful, the meat was tender & not chewy, And the portions were huge - enough to share for 4 people. The cheese didn't get dry, the creme wasn't too runny, it was simply tasty! We also had the almond horchata w/rum in it. DEE-LISH-OUS lol

Brought the fam for an early dinner and we had a good time.  I had: fried chicken entree  Hubby: Korean beef entree 4 yr old: buttered noodles w/fries  Well we all finished our plates! We enjoyed our food so we will be back for sure. This time though I might have to bring my own hot sauce since their only options are tobacco cholula and sriracha, & you just Can't have fried chicken and Not have Louisiana hot sauce!! So that was disappointing but the chicken was still delicious. The batter is slightly sweet & im not a big fan of sweet entrees but this was subtle and the chicken was tender & juicy so I have to say that I liked it more than LoLo's. Which I'm sure is a big statement for some people. Lol my biscuit Was (I capitalize because I ate that $hit up!) fluffy, buttery, & sweet.  4 year old daughter ate everything up which is rare so we are happy that money wasn't wasted! Shell type of noodles, a pretty good serving size & Parmesan was easy to eat.  Hubby says his plate was amazingly tasty. Period. He was satisfied so overall we had a great experience.  Service was good. He (Conner) had quite a few tables so I just had to make sure not to forget anything when he did come around.

This is my second time here and I love it! it's super sanitary everyone is super nice and upon arriving you can electronically put your name on the list and see the wait times of the people ahead of you. I got a pedicure this time around but will definitely be back for a manicure. My technician needs special attention to detail (no smudges left on my skin, the color was placed on smoothly & well trimmed) and the prices are extremely reasonable. The only drawback is that you cannot add a tip if you are paying with a card. They have an ATM that charges a two dollar service fee however, upon paying cash they give you that service fee amount off of your bill. At least that was my experience.

Goodness, the atmosphere here is GREAT! The owner is super energetic, friendly, hospitable, the music is lively with a mix of genres.  The food - is Fresh and you can definitely taste it. It's light and you don't feel guilty from it being so heavy or eating an entire pizza to yourself lol which can easily be done. My 3 year old Ate Up the Margherita pizza and she is a picky eater so we are even more delighted. We also ordered the 301 and it's also delicious. The crust is thin and not too thick I would prefer a Little more crispy but still satisfying the way it is. The sauce is light and the cheese wasn't too much and simply tasted fresh. The tiramisu and creme br√ªl√©e - both single serving size but easily shareable. Not too sweet or heavy.  I'm pretty sure we're making this our new weekly pizza place.

Service deserves a 5 star! Our server was an older woman and was on top of it! Coffee was refilled, check-ins were timed appropriately and knowledgable with the menu and gave us options with salsas.  The portions were perfect for the prices that we paid, and the taste was actually pretty good! I have to say that I preferred their potatoes over Matt's big breakfast because they were toasted evenly throughout (not burnt on one side) - they could have been seasoned more but regardless, they were good. The eggs were cooked perfectly and they tasted like real eggs, the hashbrowns were plentiful and again a decent sized portion. I had the Belgian waffle and my husband had the pancakes both were good - we've had better but they were decent. For it being a last minute decision we were very happy with this restaurant for breakfast. It definitely felt like the neighborhood restaurant - homely feel. :)

Wow. Just yum! We left still thinking about our orders!  my husband and I tried the sausage pizza & chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries. He had the grape of throne & the pale down unda and I had the Irish red. The fries were lightly salted, the size was perfect - not shoe string or wedges and just the right amount of soft crunch. The club sandwich is what took the spotlight! The chicken was juicy and no condiments were needed at all. It wasn't a big chunk of meat - it was thin grilled just perfectly. The sourdough bread was toasted and buttered just right, nice & golden and soft yet, toasty. The bread soaked up the delicious chicken juices but still kept the buttery edges the right amount of crunch. The pizza had a delicious and generous red sauce that had a smalllll hint of sweetness but still a good salty paired with the spicy sausage. We ordered wings to go too! Can't wait to come back and try something else although we feel the sandwich is worth being a regular order.  Portions are decent for the price too.  :)

We love trying new places! Flower child has a Great open space and modern feel.  Healthy is what they claim and success! we loved our food! However don't expect to leave feeling stuffed or full. Or there being any soda (our fav) We feel satisfied and that's great!  I had the mushroom Pho w/steak - great flavor! The noodles however seemed to break too easily, the steak was yummy. A little too thick but still filling overall.  Husband had the Forbidden rice w/steak and he liked his plate as well.  We shared the saut√©ed spinach & cauliflower - yummy. We'd order it again. Our 4yo had the chicken w/broccoli & Parmesan and brown rice. Broccoli could have been a bit more tender but overall a hit.  Will we be back? Not sure. It's great, but over priced in our opinion ($50). Guess it'll depend how hungry we are.
