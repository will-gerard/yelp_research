I bought a 2008 Sentra SE-R from Mark Kia a couple years ago, my salesman was Bobby O'Donnell. It was honestly one of the smoothest car buying experiences I've ever had. The car was exactly what I was looking for, and the price was right, but the car was located in Glendale and I was in Scottsdale. No problem, Bobby had the car moved just to allow for a test drive within 24 hours. I was given a more than fair value for my trade-in, and within 90 minutes I was on the road in my new ride, along with 4 free oil changes and a warranty. When I finally sold the car, it was for no reason other than needing a more adult-oriented upgrade. I'm still in regular contact with Bobby, he's definitely found a return buyer in me.

Definitely some of the absolute BEST Mexican I've ever had. The fish tacos were super flavorful and perfectly crispy, the asada street style tacos were awesome, the rolled tacos were amazing and piled high with black beans, cheese and sour cream, and the chicken quesadilla was tastier than any other I've had. The staff was friendly, the food was amazing and affordable, and the guy running the place was super cool. My only gripe is that I live in Chandler, and now I'm going to have to drive 30 mins to eat here, which I'm going to do, because it's that good.

Simple order.... A #9 cut in half, add Dijon mustard. Not cut in half, no mustard. Took 50 mins. Delightful. Second bad experience here. 3rd chance won't happen, I'm done.

This shop is nothing short of amazing. The staff is friendly and knowledgable, the prices and the quality of the products they sell are great. But the custom juice bar is where my heart lies. Oh that wall of flavors, it brings a small tear of joy to the outer corner of my right eye just typing about it. The possibilities are essentially endless, and at $8.00 for 30ml of CUSTOM juice, this place is absolutely unbeatable.

This place is absolutely amazing, the staff went above and beyond, they were extremely friendly and answered all of our questions, and even helped with assembly and basic starter education. I highly recommend Speakeasy to anyone currently into vaping, or looking to start.

I really only have one gripe about this shop. The juices on the sample bar all contain various nicotine levels. Some seem to be very low and have just a barely there throat hit, and some seem to be extremely high, to the point of not even being able to actually taste the juice you're sampling.
