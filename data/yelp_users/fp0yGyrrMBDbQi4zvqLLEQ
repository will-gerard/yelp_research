Moto is where I really got hooked on sushi, though what I have had off of the rest of the menu is always yummy too. The sushi is always fresh and the sweet potato fries are a great side to share with the table. I recommend Moto Happy Hour to friends all the time for sushi on a budget - the California, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Yellowtail rolls are all half-price and you can grab a 20oz beer for $3.50 to wash it all down. The "underground menu" is also a great option when your feeling flush - the rolls are all $12 each. My favorites are the volcano roll when I want something spicy and the mayflower roll when I want something bright and fresh. YUM!  My only complaint (besides the Fox news that is always on the television sets) is that they don't usually have the Ace Pear cider on tap like they used to... my non-beer drinking friends always appreciated the option and it was a favorite of mine as well.  UPDATE: the underground menu is above ground now - printed and pricey! The happy hour is still worthwhile and the beer list always has decent craft options (although they still lack a consistent cider for those who enjoy it and tend towards primarily hoppy beer choices). We still love the place and as we prepared to move cross-country, it was one of the few spots my husband needed to visit before saying goodbye for a year.

I'll admit it... I don't have any piercings besides my ears that have been pierced since I was five. That said, Halo is one of my favorite places to shop. The jewelry selection at Halo is unparalleled! I have found amazing deals (like the fabulous skull necklace that EVERYONE comments on and I got for a steal) and gorgeous indulgences (like the awesome blood-wood earrings I put on to show off... mind you they were only an indulgence because I am a student and have a $0 jewelry budget.) I haven't broken down and picked up one of the glass bracelets I ogle every time I stop in yet, but it is just a matter of time.   Though I haven't gone "under the needle" myself, I have accompanied friends to Halo to be pierced. Without a doubt it is the cleanest and most professional piercing place I've ever seen. The staff are always knowledgeable and I have even seen them turn down business rather than do a piercing they knew wouldn't heal and maintain well. I wish I could get integrity like that from some other businesses!  Honestly one of the best locally-owned businesses in town (and I make a point to shop local whenever it is reasonable to).

Music matters, and listening to records on the right equipment makes the experience amazing. HiFi not only sells the best record players, speakers, and accessories, but they are the most knowledgeable people to help you put together a system to meet your needs.   The listening room gave me a great idea of what I was looking for, and I even picked up a record to play on it while I was there. Friendly, high quality service from people who really know their business. Highly recommended!

LOVE this place - and I don't have kids!   As a non-mom, I am constantly finding myself out shopping for family and friends who have children even though I don't really know what to buy. Since Hissyfits opened, I have had a much easier time of things. Baby showers and children's birthday parties have been made a thousand times easier because I know I can stop by Hissyfits and will be able to find something fun and funky that folks in my social circle will enjoy (and I will usually be able to get a great deal on it!)   The staff is super-friendly and helpful, even when they are busy going through the boxes of merchandise it seems are always coming in. I have brought mom-friends to shop there and I always hear from them that they "just had to go back" because they found such a great (outfit, toy, pair of shoes, etc.) for their little ones. Really, Hissyfits is just a great place to shop!

I'd heard some positive buzz, but was rather unimpressed. We hit Hanny's on a Friday night and it struck me as one of those places that try to do too much and end up not doing much very well. My salad was okay but nothing I'd make a special trip for, my friend who ordered the Shrimp Pancetta appetizer said it was yummy, but the third in our party had the Pork Calabrese sandwich and it was so greasy I my skin almost broke out just sitting next to it. The too-loud (and "too cool") DJ and overpriced drinks didn't help the situation. It is a cool space and perhaps I just wanted too much, but I was simply disappointed.  I would give it another try, but only if other people were going and it was an "I'll meet up with you there" kind of thing. It definitely wouldn't be my pick. I hear the pizzas are a tasty option and I would give them a try if I find myself back there. Maybe they will win me over then.

One of my favorite places for an easy, casual breakfast, brunch, or even lunch. The staff is consistently friendly and the food is tasty. Wonderful options for vegetarians (like me) and vegans (try their awesome vegan french toast!)

I found Leah online when I was searching for a suitable trainer to help me work with my nervous rescue dog. He is a doxie-mix mutt of some sort, so a relatively small dog, but he was alternately scared into lock-down position or prompted to act lack a big, tough bully. With her help, he has become much more comfortable, trusting and reliable, even in situations where he used to freak out.  As he got better, we found he really needed a friend and Leah helped with our second dog as well. He is a high-energy beagle mix and really loves training. It is a great outlet for his energy. The classes and Leah's wonderful advice helped us bring the two dogs together and be able to trust them when we go out about town.  While our schedules have been limited, DHTA has offered great opportunities for review and practice at workshops. Now that I am on summer break, we will be starting the intermediate class and can't wait to see what else they can do!.

I keep coming back because the I simply love their tacos. I'm pescatarian (seafood only, no other meat), but I've shared meals here with vegetarians  and my dining guests always say they plan to come back. I love the veggie taco and the vegan option, and usually pair one of them with either a shrimp or mahi mahi. Always delicious (and, of course, the salsa bar if great!)
