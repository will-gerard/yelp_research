Staff was dismissive, throwing food at each other and lazy. Unwilling to make more queso because they were "about to close" at 7:45pm. Costa Vida is worth the 30min drive.

Won't be going anywhere else for haircuts, this place is awesome. Nathan got me in right away and gave me the best cut I've had in half the time it normally takes. I recommend this place for sure.
