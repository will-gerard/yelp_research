Okay I have not actually BEEN to this farm, but I just tasted some of their peach pie from the peach festival this last weekend...  My friend at work made the trek to queen creek for the festival, and although she said the festival wasn't all that amazing, the pie I just ate is to die for.  The best peach pie I have ever tasted. I'd give it 5 stars, but since I personally have never been to this location, it wouldn't be accurate. The 3 bites of pie I had made it worth a review though :)

If I could afford it, I would live here. They've got everything!  Gourmet bakery (cases and cases of handmade pastries), local gelato (yum), espresso bar, sushi bar, fine alcohols, outdoor seating next to the BBQ lunch bar, nice produce, lots of meat choices (sadly, no buffalo though) nice people!   Don't get up here very often, but last summer I spent a lot of time outside in their bistro tables, working on my microbiology homework. The outside area was the perfect setting for an iced latte, a muffin, and some hardcore learnin' about microbes.

Yay! I finally got over to Babbo. I didn't know it existed until I read other positive reviews, and it did not disappoint!   It was a random hour - 3pm this afternoon, and we weren't sure what to eat. So we stopped in and checked out the menu.  Definitely reasonably priced, so we stuck around. My dining partner ordered the creamy pasta with mushrooms, asparagus, and chicken. I had the Italiano sandwich. Salami and italian meats with oil, vinegar, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and pepperonccini. I also had an arnold palmer, which the waitress accidentally made with passion fruit iced tea rather than regular - and it was amazing. My sandwich came with the fried zucchini chips and at that point I was pretty certain I had died and gone to zucchini heaven. Worth the trip alone. I ate all of them.  Friend and I traded bites, her pasta was very tasty. The starter bread and oil they brought out was good. My other half of sandwich came home with me. Only complaint is that the staff was a little over-zealous, but we were the only people in the joint, so I guess I can't blame them. They were probably bored. Good stuff!!

I really like this place a lot.   I worked the front counter at a quality dry cleaner's my entire high school career. I know dry cleaning, and I know when people do a crappy job. If anywhere tells you they can do 1-day dry cleaning.... don't buy it. You'll get bad results.   This location is not a chain, and they do everything in-house. This is the way it should be done. It seems to be a family place, and they are always really friendly. They also accept competitor's coupons.  When I first started searching for dry cleaners around my area, my clothes came back with white spots, not pressed, and linty.. etc. Absolutely not worth the money. This place is worth the 15 minute drive from my house.   It really seems like they take their time. They've sewn buttons back on for me, and took special care for stains. They also press my pants with creases the way I like them! I have never had any problem with this dry cleaners.

I am a fan. We've definitely gotten a few dishes we didn't care for (we being the man and I), but sometimes thats just how it goes. Overall, the good dishes have far outweighed the bad.  KILLER happy hour. They've changed it 3x in 2 years which can be a bit annoying, but every single thing we've ever ordered off the $3 happy hour menu has been thoroughly enjoyed. Tasty beers, the man loves their raptor red.   Amazing veggie burgers, and I am not even a vegetarian! This is probably one of my favorite things on their menu. The only thing they don't do well is pizza..... but other than that I love this place, which is different for me as I am not a fan of chains generally.

I have nothing overly detailed to add that other people haven't already said, but this place is basically my neighbor and I have only been there twice.   Both times though I was really impressed with their quality, and got a lot of food for my money. Yum!

How has no one else reviewed this place? Wow.  Well I have only been once or twice so I am not the dazzo's expert, but I remember it being pretty awesome.   Kosher dogs and hamburgers. Fries. Chili. All the goodies on top you can imagine. Seriously amazingly tasty. Located in the ghetto, really tiny parking lot, but worth it.   Someone else who is more knowledgable should come review Dazzo's!

Not impressed.  Expensive, mediocre food. Slow waitress.  Okay... not INCREDIBLY expensive, but not worth it for average food.

I've avoided reviewing Pita Jungle because I just don't think my meager words can do it justice. So this is what I've come up with:  If I could live here for the rest of my life and roll around in their hummus all day long, I would die happy.  My favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix. Hands down.

Chanpen is another one that I have avoided reviewing because I am not sure exactly how to convey how awesome it is. (disclaimer: I have only been once, so there is still room for error, but it was really good that one time!)  My work-friend brought myself and a third lady from work to Chanpen. I had been looking for good thai on the west side. She said it was a hole in the wall.... she wasn't joking. But often those are the best places.  We walked in (a little early for the dinner crowd) and the employees were sprawled out across the couch, watching thai soaps. I found this to be more humorous than irritating, after all it is a family place. We ordered SO.MUCH.FOOD. I thought i was going to die of overindulgence.   Between the three of us, we had an appetizer sampler, 4 entree's, and rice. I can't remember all the entree's, but I know the pad thai was amazing. What's funny about me is that I don't like curry, I don't like coconut, and I'm not huge on peanut sauce. Well, that's like 90% of thai food. This place met and exceeded my picky-thai expectations.   Oh, and I drank an entire pot of jasmine tea to myself. Needless to say, I went home that night and cleaned my entire apartment from top to bottom. Maybe it wasnt the caffeine.... maybe it was just a high from damn good thai!

Why, oh why am I SO picky about italian food?  I can't help it. my tastebuds have been offended more often than overjoyed in almost every italian restaurant I have been to since moving to Arizona.  This place was dumb. We were seated at this awful middle-of-the-room table and I felt like I was in a fishbowl. The decor was..... tacky.   You can tell that they are trying to be cute, so for that I guess I give them some credit, but the food did not measure up. It was average at best, and the focaccia bread that they bring you to start is mostly oil and fat with a bit of dough. Tasty? yes. Rapidly enhancing the obesity epidemic sweeping the nation? Also yes.  Sorry tagliani's, my mouth (and waistline) do not approve.

I quite enjoy Bravi. I have been there 3 times, I think. Twice I sat in the bar (table service is only in the bar) and once I did take-out.   Things I have had/tried:  caesar salad mediterranean salad ravioli cheese pizza tuscan pizza w/ chicken  I really can't think of anything on this list I didn't enjoy. In fact, I seem to have a memory of leaving Bravi overstuffed and perhaps a bit tipsy on the house white wine. If you overeat, it's safe to assume it was tasty.  Okay I am usually a HUGE nit-pick about "authentic" italian foods.... but what I like about bravi is it isn't pretentious or assuming. They don't come off to me like they are trying to prove something, and that I like. Also, (i think?) the pizza's are wood-fired, and that is truly the ONLY way to go with italian pizzas.   Can be a bit hectic, but reasonably priced and a fun after-work stop off with the office ladies.

Amazing, amazing, amazing. Been there less than 10 times due to living super far away, but would be there every day if I could. Haven't had the fruit flavors, but all the chocolate and nut ones are great. Had real gelato across the walk from Treve Fountain while in Rome... and this might just be better.   Only complaint is one time I had a snotty high schooler helping me out.. but whatever. The ice cream makes up for snotty kids.  DELISH!!!

Okay I know that this place is closed, so writing a review is pretty much moot..... but what the hell, I'm in a sharing mood.  Dear.Sweet.LORD.   THE WORST  I MEAN ****WORST**** restaurant experience I have ever had. EVER.  It's been closed for quite some time now, and my memory is failing as to exactly every detail...but let's see what I can come up with..  Party of 4, we walked in and there was no hostess. Other patrons milling about, also waiting. Some woman with a baby bottle kept walking up front and grabbing stuff, leaving w/o talking to us. Finally she said "someone" would be with us shortly.   We're seated. Throughout the HOURS that we sat there, we were consistently (more than once) give the wrong dishes, no water, no chips, and no refills on drinks. It took an act of CONGRESS to track anyone down. Finally, mid-horrific-evening, we flat-out asked someone "Do we even HAVE a server?!" because everyone who walked by either ignored us or said they'd take care of something but never did. Their answer? No! They ACTUALLY said no!   Great. So hours pass, and the man is getting heated by now, not to mention the people who suggested it (other half of our party) are embarassed.   Owner/manager seems to be the only one trying to help the ENTIRE restaurant - but he's still doing a poor job. He makes excuses about "5 of his waitstaff" calling off that night. Uh huh.   by the way - the food that we DID get was decent.  Anyway, more time passes and we notice other tables getting up to ROAM the place for the manager, a server, anyone! So our friend gets up and does the same thing. He reams the manager about our experience, what we were charged for and never recieved, so on and so forth..... Manger gives us a 50% off bill.   We shouldn't have even paid that. The entire thing should have been comped. Honestly, I don't look for freebees, but this was the most outrageous experience I have ever seen. We left zero tip.  Felt a little sorry for them, but like Kevin H. said, it is not surprising that they went down, and quickly.

Ok I think the only reason I am reviewing a fast-food joint is to get my review numbers higher ;)  With that said, this place was pretty darn good!  I have lived in AZ for 2 years now, and neither my boyfriend or I had gotten into a chik-fil-a. So after a long flight last night, we went through the drive-through for some quick dinner.  Wow! I was impressed! Quick, efficient, and very friendly service. All white chicken, cooked to perfection (who woulda thought?) and the fries were so much fun!! They gave us a ton of different sauces, and my boyfriend made fun ot me for telling them it was our "first time" eating there.   We both got their GIANT chocolate shakes... I would have liked it to be a little bit more chocolate-y. Everything was good though. After the deluxe sandwich and fries, I couldn't even get halfway through the shake.  Would go again if I was craving fast food!

Pleasantly surprised.   Been here twice, and my only complaint is that the bill can add up quickly.   The first time we ordered pizza, wings, and beer. Can't remember which kind of each of these things we got, but I know I thought it was good, and that I was sad it wasn't a little cheaper so we could go more often (I am a cheapskate..). Also we got the giant cookie dessert.  The second time we went, I got the house chardonnay (meh...) and the baked ziti with meatballs, the man got the chicken parmesan. I think he has made it his personal duty to all italian restaurants ever to eat chicken parmesan, to be able to compare them ALL one day.   Anyways, our slightly over-zealous waitress brings the food out, and its HUUUUUGE!!! I think each of our plates could have fed 3 people. I was glad we didn't get salads or appetizers. He quite enjoyed the chicken, and my ziti was smothered in this awesome red/white (bechemel?) sauce mixture with mozarella on top and 3 little garlic knots. I picked most of the mozarella off (trying to diet on italian food? Doesn't work too well.....) but i tried nonetheless :) . I boxed up over half of it, and his leftovers heated up well the next night for dinner.   To top it off, we had another serving of the giant cookie. This put me over the edge and it was definitely an i-ate-too-much kind of an evening! So basically the only downside is that each time, with just the two of us, the bill reached somewhere around $50. Granted we were drinking, but still........  Overall, its not the place to go if you want something super fancy (although there was a little prom couple there...) ... but for moderately priced, fairly good food it works!

I was hired to work here before they officially opened, but unfortunately had to turn it down due to family issues and time constraints. I was very sad that I was unable to join their team, because it is ADORABLE!   Good atmosphere, nice people, owner really seemed like a genuine guy to me. Also it is nice to get out of the starbucks/coffee bean rut.

Sweet "O" is more like Sweet "NO".   Was intruiged by their website and good reviews, went on a wednesday afternoon around 430. We were the ONLY table. We ordered a two drinks, two sandwiches, and one dessert to share. The drinks were good, and the food had a lot of potential (although one sandwich was better than the other...) until I found a pretty gross hair embedded in the middle of my sandwich, mid-bite. Now, anyone who's worked food service can respect the occasional mistake. Sure, you cant control when your hair falls out. But what is getting the bad review from me is how BADLY the staff handled it.   Upon notifying the waitress, she unapologetically stated "Well I have no idea how that could have possibly gotten in there"... Almost as if I placed it there. It was short, black, and still had skin connected to it. I don't have short black hair. So she took it away. She then asked if I would like something else, to which I asked if it were possible to make another half sandwich. She came out with a completely different sandwich than I ordered (which of course was the one I didn't care for). So I gave up on trying to get any more dinner and we focused on dessert. It was decent, but nothing I couldn'tve gotten at applebee's on happy hour.   Then came the bill. Not a single thing had been comped, and it reached $60 dollars. When my friend complained, the waitress hastily said "I'll get the manager". Manager comes bustling out, sets a new bill on the table, and walks off.   I understand mistakes in food. I truely do. But the way this staff handled a mistake that was completely their own was ridiculous. Never ONCE in the evening did we get an "I'm sorry" from any staff member.  I won't be going back there again. And by the attitues they exhibited, It didn't appear as if they cared that I told anyone else not to go there either.  2/19/08 EDIT: The owner has contacted me, apologized, and shared that there is new management. Might be worth another try.

4.5 stars.   The man and I decided that since these are our last two days in Arizona, we needed to try as many non-chain places as possible. Also, since all of our kitchen is packed in boxes, we needed some breakfast food this morning. Yelp to the rescue and cue..Mike & Rhondas!  Wow. This place definitely lived up to the hype. You know you've found a keeper when they have advertisements around the boarder of the menu. I got a build-your-own omelette with egg whites only (yesssss!!), peppers, onions, ham, and pepperjack cheese. It came with hashbrowns and I ordered fruit instead of breads. No extra charge! The man ordered "The hungry man" meal which came with 3 eggs, 2 sausage patties, hashbrowns, and three HUGE biscuts with gravy...the size of your head!!   The battle between my man and the hungry man ended in a doggie bag to take home.. neither of us could finish our meals. We brought home what could easily be a third meal.  Friendly, ridiculously fast service. I only wish I had found this place 2 years ago when I first moved here, rather than 2 days before I was leaving!!

Been here for breakfast twice, lunch once, and dinner once.  Breakfast both times was pretty good. HUGE portions. Busy place. I guess the sausages are homemade? Can't remember having anything for breakfast that I didn't like. Both guests I went with on both occasions were happy too. Service is mostly on top of things and friendly.   For lunch I had "the gobbler" with fries... a turkey sandwich with cranberry, avacado, tomato, and onion. Fries were pretty darn impressive. Enjoyed this sandwich. The time I went for dinner I remember thinking it was just average. Still massive portions though.  Only downside I have found to the place was today when we ordered a "blackbeary" cobbler to go. Thinking that this was black bear diner, the blackberry cobbler should be a specialty.... it was pretty lackluster. Mostly just goo with a few berries, topped with a pie-crust like topping that wasn't quite cooked all the way. We popped it in the microwave and tried to help it out with some vanilla ice cream, but it just wasn't good. Not AWFUL, but not good. So we won't get that again. Otherwise a decent place!

Had been to NoRTH's sister restaurant "Sauce" a few times, figured I'd make the step up to the classier version. Made reservations and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Servers brought out an adorable olive tray with green and kalmata olives. Our server (Dominic?) was extremely attentive and knowledgable when I asked about the wines and my date inquired about the beer, and his timing was good. They offer wine by the standard glass and bottle, but they also offer by a glass-and-a-half. This was a perfect pour.  We skipped appetizers and I ordered the pasta bolognese while my boyfriend opted for the chicken parmigiana. After we ordered, we were brought bread and a roasted tomato butter. This was very tasty. My bolognese arrived with giant shells as the pasta, with large shavings of parmesan on top. It was delicous, with the exception of having fennel in it (which is just a personal preference!). I ate almost all of it. Sadly, we found the chicken parm to be a little bland.   To end the evening we ordered the "nutella mousse cake" which sounded amazing but was also a bit disappointing. We ate about half of it and when our waiter asked how it was and our response was mediocre, he insisted on comping the dish even though we had eaten half of it. This got big points in my book. He said "if you don't absolutely love it, I can't charge you for it". Our bill for two after a good tip for the waiter was about $70.  Overall, I recommend NoRTH.  the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the parm was a little bland and it was a bit pricey. If you are looking for a nice evening out (and are ready to spend a bit) it is appropriate, but for pasta or pizza, go to "Sauce".

So basically, if you don't like stir fry paradise, you have no soul. Plain and simple.  I'll admit, it took me a few months to get my exact sauce-combination down, and I am disappointed that they do not have the "sriracha hot chili sauce" to put on top (you know the stuff....bright red chile sauce, green lid... has a rooster picture on it..) but I still love this place.  Other reviews are accurate. Staff is amazingly friendly, and they all seem to be family. The food is cooked fast, and you create it yourself to your liking. LOTS of meat choices: beef, pork, turkey, chicken, tofu, shrimp. Fresh veggies and most importantly: cilantro....... LOVE it.   Side items are delish. Egg rolls and spring rolls for you vegetarians, 2 kinds of soup, a few other things...... but best of all are their fried pastry things. Basically they are really airy doughnut holes, fried and covered in sugar. My god. I would go there just for them. Also when you get your check, there's cute little tasty candies with it. Dinner for two is under $20.
