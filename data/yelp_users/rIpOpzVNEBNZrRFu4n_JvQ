It is a sports bar with reasonable charges for food and drink. The food however is your typical bar food and nothing seems all too fresh. I had the turkey burger and my hubby had a chicken sandwich. Both tasted like they had come from the freezer and thrown on a grill. The tater tots tasted like they had been over fried, refried or the oil needed to be changed. I think the kitchen cuts corners which is a real shame because I like the atmosphere there.

Awesome wine selection and the owners Bryan and Nancy make you feel like you are in their home. Prices are spot on and reasonable.  Nice selection of cheese and crackers if you are hungry. Save room for the chocolates by Jason Wasser Confections.
