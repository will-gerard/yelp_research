It's always a good time! It definitely beats TV. Support the arts and have some fun. It's a great venue and small enough to feel very cozy. Sit near the front to feel close to the actors. There is some great talent.

I couldn't reserve online though it showed the movie time open. It gave me an error. I tried to call the theater and no one answered. I drove down to find out and the teenager told me it was sold out. Why couldn't they show that online and/or answer the phone.  Elevator was filthy dirty too and fingerprints all over the doors. We left and I will never go back.

We had our company Christmas Party there.  Before closing, the staff turned the lights out over half our table.  The darkness was so overwelming, that we all forgot what we were even talking about.  When we were leaving our ruined party, we spoke to the staff about this.  They responded that "we all have families to go home to."  They don't care about their customers' experiences there.  I will never go there again.  Not even an "I'm sorry!" from them.

I feel very lucky to have found Liz from EK Tax and Accounting.  I have fought for 5 years to find a good CPA and finally I have found her.  She is everything I could hope for in a CPA.  She does very thorough tax planning which has saved me TONS of money already this year.  She is very timely with responding to requests.  She looks out for the interests of the business.  I feel confident that I am getting the best tax advise that I can get.  I can't say enough wonderful things about her.

I like the gym but their hours need to be better. Opening at 8 am on weekends is ridiculous. They also need to open by 5 am on weekdays but open at 6. Last Saturday literally 20 people were standing out front at 8:40 am after they were supposed to already be open. An employee never showed up to open the doors. I left so I have no idea what time they actually opened.

I loved the atmosphere! We went on a weekday so we didn't have a wait problem. I thought the food was okay but nothing to write home about. Our hostess was not the friendliest but I liked our waiter.

I am sorry I hadn't been here before. From the outside you have no idea what hidden treasures are inside. Everything we had as appetizers and our meals were great.  I love the new variety to our palettes. I highly recommend you come here.
