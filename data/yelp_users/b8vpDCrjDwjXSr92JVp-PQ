Simply the best! I was there for the yelp event but could have spent the night I just couldnt get enough.  There is so much to explore and learn! I enjoyed laying on the bed of nails, and moving the ball with my mind. I have recommened this for people that live here and people from out of town on vacation.  Staff is incredably fun and happy to help and assist you.  I just cant say enough but , Ill simply say GO!!.. thats all I feel I can say wthout rambing about how amazing this place is.

Busy busy busy.. actually too busy.  We made reservations and were sat promptly. Very small but warm. Staff was nice. You can tell it was a full house but just incredibly understaffed.  Chow- After waiting an insane amount of time we ordered a cheese plate. Had a nice amount of cheeses and fruit. Nice start. I then ordered the lamb and my boyfriend ordered the pork. Mine looked like a piece of meat dropped in a bowl of Dinty's soup. Bleh. However, My boyfriend food was insanely Delicious. it had a raspberry chipolte glaze and goat cheese. Just melted in your mouth I was super jealous.  Service- took forever until we saw our server in between ordering and it was over 45 minutes after ordering before our food arrived. It was awful. We did bring our own bottle of wine but sitting there without food for 45 minutes its hard to just sit there with your wine staring in your face and not drink it because you want it to pair with your food.   Break it down - We did choose this restaurant as it is BYOB , so we could enjoy a very nice bottle without the inflated restaurant price of wine, however I will take a big twist of my arm to go here again, even though one dish was nice , the service was not up to the standard considering the price of the food. I much rather stay home and cook my own. Pretty let down.

OH , How i dont want to review this because it my little hidden gem!! MINE MINE MINE::))  Local Staff- I have to do the people and the owners in the same catagory. Bob and Lisa are just to two best owners. Lisa is just a ton of fun and Bob is full of knowledge. Always there to fill your glass and have great conversation. I say the locals of the bar are always chatty too and everyone seems to offer you a taste of their wine if you have never tried it. It really feels like your a your friends dinner party, minus the food.  Cheesy Things- Although it is a wine bar at not offering food, you can pick from a selection cheeses and salami and crackers that they will put together for you. If thats not enough order a pizza from down the street and eat it up, just be sure to make sure you get enought for everyone:) lol  Vino- its al amazingly priced wine at what seems to be an average of 16 or so dollars. Largest selection of Arizona Wines!! plus a few beers, Champagne and sparakling wine to choose from.  Parties- They do theme parties once a month , the 50's night was great raising money for charity. Every Friday and Sat they do tasting as well.   Break it Down Jess- Just by far one of the hidden gems, that i dont want anyone to know about because im selfish ha ha. you will always feel wecome by everyone there and be part of the family in no time. oh yeah did I mention NO CORKING FEE. yeah, thats right... See you there soon!

Blah, Unless you are bowling during league play , dont bother , the lanes are never oiled and the ball goes all over the lanes, not very fun when your actually trying. If you are looking to just hang out and score dosent matter.  The specials are great so its a fun time for the price , usually 10 bucks for two hours, not too shabby.  Boozers Beware!- Get at least two drinks when you go to the bar, it might still take them ten minutes to make. The bar is a dreadful place with a painfully slow staff.  I would much rather go to anyother location.

Bring your reading glasses for the menu! It a big chain so not too much to say.  Surroundings- Its huge , menu is overwhelming and has advertising with I find annoying.  Staff- Some of the best.   Eats- cant complain, I can eat the pizzettes all day long for 4.95 all day long! The ricotta and sausage or the Pear and goat cheese is the best!  Have a go , you wont be sorry!

It Keeps getting better!  I have been going here for many years , was never really the best spot , however, cheap drinks, low key and good location.But things are changing in the best way.  Eats- Worlds best BLT! .Its pretty standard but for some reason the way it tastes is great, loaded with bacon on toasted bread, super fresh crispy lettuce. noms. I am a big fan of the Asian chicken salad and brownie for dessert.  Drinks- Great happy hour prices,( pretty cheap even when its not), plus no matter what you drink or whatever flavor you like , I can bet they have it! I swear they have every flavor or vodka known to man! OJ and marshmallow vodka , YES PLEASE!  Redo- Looks like they just remodeled , it used to be kinda dark but it seems quite a bit brighter and cleaner and more spacious, a much needed change. I think its now a place where me and my ladies will be going much more often. Especially with $4 dollar drink specials at night. Free wi-fi is a huge plus!!  Staff- a little life and personality is behind the bar now! fresh friendly faces with drinks being made quick and with a smile. They do offer OTB, which has a friendly and helpful staff and is happy to show you how to bet for all the rookies out there.  A happy little corner bar that is so much more! Cant wait to go back..More than likely tonight, see you there!

Its everywhere so its hard to say all you can write is about certain locations, right?  Well I go to the one in Old Town scottsdale a bit but mainly in Kierland so thats what this is about.  smile hour- is great , they offer super deals on drinks and food during the happy hours so you cant beat it.  Service and smiles- I highly recommend sitting at or in the bar for the best service. The ladies seem to have worked there for a long time and rock out the drinks and conversation.  Aroma- although most sushi places have a smell to them the down side of sitting at the bar is you get the normal smells plus thestale beer of the bar, but I think its such a great place , you get over it real quick. PLus you can always sit on the patio and people watch , which is the BEST!  Nom Noms- Miso soup, Las Vegas Roll( not my fav but every person I know lves it) , caterpillar rool and any sashimi, will always be fast and fresh. Never a complaint there.  Break it down Jess- Its corprate so they cant really screw up but of all the RA's I have been to cleanliness, service, staff and vibe, this is by far the best . Hopefully I will see you there.

Very well oiled lanes.  Great specials. Very clean.  Drinkers Beware!!! Worlds slowest bar staff, I cant even call them bartenders. They are just people that are getting your beer. So so so so sad, its hard for me to leave a tip.

So much cheesieness!!  Always hot and fresh whether you pick it up or you have it delivered.   I live pretty close so I usually pick it up. They have a very clean location and a fresh looking salad area. The staff is always right in front to greet you with a big smile.  You can see the kitchen and the cooks, which I always appreciate.  Although there is no bar service you can grab a glass of wine or a beer. They do have a very large dining area so bring the whole gang! Two large flat screen TV's hung high! See you there!   Great great pizza! (also look online for coupons)

i live in Scottsdale for about half of the month and recently decided that when its just me and my boyfriend go out with just us we will try a new place every time.   we decided to do a lunch at The Orange Table, after finding it after a little trouble, we walked in with anticipation of a nice brunch/lunch. we walked up to the girl at the counter exception to be seating she handed us the menu and said the tables near the walls are clean.  Before we ate already starting with a bad taste in our mouths. We looked over the menu and ordered our drinks(water & Soda) after about ten minutes ( still no drinks) we ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad.   Drinks finally came , we ate and left. the end. Service had zero personality and food lack any "yuuuum" factor.   So many people have eaten there , I guess I expected to remember the flavors of the food, maybe there was just none there.   The only thing positive was the Mojo Chai I had, unfortunately I had my food before my drink came.

I have been here several times and have never been let down.  The most important thing I can say about this place is the service is AMAZING.. let me fill you in . . .Every time I have been to Kazimierz , I have shown up very close to 2 am with a group of about 8 to 10. They have never let us down and always seem to be actually happy . Most servers seem to be angry that they might actually have to stay late and take care of people.   They have always helped us out , if they happen to be out of something, which is rare  but always recommend something we end up enjoying even more!   Plus always enjoying a cheese plate. Food is great !!   No Complaints , great to take first timers of Scottsdale too!

If you cant find it at Fashion Square it probably doesn't exists! After traveling to new york so many people asked if we went to time square and our answer was " why would we? everything there is at fashion square a minute from where we live" The fact that so many people travel to time square for the shopping and pretty much all of it is located in fashion square says alot.!!   Even if you cant afford the 18000 purse at Burberry( ueah $18000)  or the $6000 stunning floral dress at Gucci, or the awesome bag at Louie Vuitton, they still have all the standard stores any mall would like wet seal , finish line holliter and pac sun.  The only complaint is that it is very big and weird levels can make it sometimes difficult to find you way around.  The only thing that I could truly say bad is The Grand Lux cafe is something that should have not been put in there. Blah food.

For a reasons unknown, many people have no idea this place is here!  Chow time- Oh lord have mercy on the Butternut squash ravioli! I could eat this until ... like.. forever! Its incredably, juicy, soft, savory, sweet... oh so great. Its even on happy hour to make it $4.50!! its craziness.  Boozehound- Great bar on the second level, barstaff is professional and fun . Happy to talk and get to know what your up to.There have whipped cream vodka too. Give it a try !  The Look- its stunning when you walk in , great red, and silver bead walls. Huge spiral staircase to the upstairs bar.  Why not five stars? Here is the hell that it Bobbys- if you walk in there around 330, yes they are open, good luck seeing anyone working, no servers no bartenders, oh wait there is a host that will say hi but then not tell you anything or get anyone to help. I have sat many times at the bar and walked out after seeing no one , asking for someone and then someone being annoyed that I wanted to eat so early. Also , they close whenever, after gathering up a group to tell them how much fun this place is.. we got there and they were closed. another time I called and they said they were closed and driving by it was a packed house. Its so agrivating not to know .. or have a specific closing time.  Break it down Jess- I will always go back, just cant stand the GM.

This mall is incredibly disappointing from how nice it once was.  Most stores are closed, and the ones that are open seem to be fly by night stores. If you buy something and anything happens don't plan on it being there to help you fix any issues.  All the good stores that were there all are gone. Even the Dillards turned into a clearance center , which has , what feels like no air conditioning.  Although the food court looks great, with nice tables, chairs and flat screens, there are just empty restaurants.  Simply drive a little farther and visit Arrowhead or PV mall. The area stores around the mall are where you will find what you are looking for as they have remodeled the surrounding area. Great finds .

Overwhelming!  I feel like I needed a nap after taking a trek through this Frys' signature Market place. Even then name is huge :P  Foodie- If you cant find it , it dosent exist.    Hot spots- They have laid out this place perfectly, from the great wine tasting location right by the cheeses. The sushi stations.. its just perfect.   NameTags- The staff ,I'm sure, understands how overwhelming , and are super helpful!! The nicest group of people. I love that they hand out a map of the place right when you walk in cause YOU WILL need it! Dont forget to stop by the cooking class area and speak with the chef!  One down side- Other than just too many people, but its a new store, if you are shopping around with a cart and decide to stop for a wine tasting , there is no place for your cart. You know some places have a stroller parking spot, they need one for your cart.   Break it down- It the best thing ever.

This spot is incredible so much more than a simple tanning spot!!   Staff- super nice girls, eager to help and answer any questions, I love them because they are not pushy to make you buy a membership but kind and informative so you actually DO WANT to get one!  Machines-yES THEY HAVE THE COOLEST tanning  machines ever! they also have a hydration station, several types of massage tables, facial machines, teeth whitening, its crazy.  I am boggled why they have not updated this page to inform everyone of all the fun changes. its a contepo spa now.    Break it down Jess- Im obsessed, i have gone everyday since I have discovered it! Literally.

Do the tasting menu for the best experience paired with the wine or Sake tasting.  No matter what you have to have the butterfish or beef tataki. The best food items on the planet.   Also if you are not sure on what to order allow the staff to pick a entire menu for you. I have done this and it works very well with large groups. (Its kinda the only thing that works)  The lounge area is a great place for a date, the watermelon martini is killer,(thats not the right name but just say that they know what you mean:)

If you have nothing to really do and just want a basic lunch in a cozy environment I say go for it. I dont know what the pie is so humble about its not that great. With all the other choices for food in scottsdale I say look elsewhere for an interesting time.

Day drinking, superbowl party, night club, birthdays, couples bull riding anything you want to do you can do it here.   We ended up here somehow, and instantly fell for the joint. Open everyday food until two! The service is the best in the state, no question. They are so full of fun , the managers walk by checking on you even wait staff that is not yours seem to help out by grabbing you another drink or clearing the table.  Portions on food are awesome but dont let that fool you on quality because I have never had anything I wouldnt want to eat forever on a desert island. The BBQ chicken nachos I have actually gone back 3 times in one day for!!  They almost always bring the table a complimentary round!!   NOTHING BEATS it!  Good for anyonekids during the day, familys, college kids. Snotty dressy club girls will stll have a good time , its nice to stop in for a drink before the clubs or after the clubs for another round and sme food!!

Top notch fun , bar lounge, and food.   My guy and I  go here almost every Wednesday, when we get into town then usually two more times over the weekend.   Music- There is a dj spinning music onthe weekends and no question the best DJ in Scottsdale , playing music mash ups people actually can dance to not just a bunch of hip hop or house music. Every now and then late night the middle area turns into quite the drunk dance floor which makes for fun dancing or really fun people watching.  Eats- We usually load up in sashimi, which the chef came out to talk to us how it was nice to see people eating real japanese not just balls of cream cheese and rice. Everything has always been super fresh. I swear I cannot lie with out the ahi tuna sliders. We always bring a large group who always leave very happy. Its a great place to start the night at!!  Service- The girls are super cute but every know and then it takes a bit too long to get a drink but when you order a comlicated martini , you cant really complain!! I love the "picachoo" yum yum.  Overall the best scottsdale stop . A million times more fun and delish then Ra or stingray!

Chains!  I dont like to review super chains but i will  I will make it short but just because I like this location at 1-17 and Thunderbird by best buy.  I fell like its the best taken care of store with the nicest crew , especially in the morning!  Just overall want to give the owners and staff props. If you go I recommend the Alhoa pineapple in small.

This one will be short and sweet.  If you like a fun, clean, social, inexpensive, fun pool, great people, food, wi-fi, active , gym.. pretty much anything awesome , you will love your life here at Trillium!!  However if you hate finding a parking spot or finally finding a spot around ,what feels like , a mile away from your apt, you will not like it.   But hands down , Trillium is the best , any location.

This seems to be good if you are not used to going out alot to fine dining places. It has a good atmosphere , cheap food but can still feel like you are going out for a night on the town.   People rave about the lettuce wraps , which I find very blah, but I cant think of anything that truly stands out with any of the food here.   This is a very safe place to go if you are with semi picky eaters or people who are on a budget. The kierland commons location I find a bit better because the area outside can be nicer for groups or in a date setting  with the fountains and courtyards.   However , if you are eating healthy, even the healthly menu will leave you felling weighed down.   You are better off eating at Ra for a lighter meal.

I'm not sure how in the universe this place received anymore than one star!!   Hot Stuff- Man o man I went in around 4ish , thinking I could beat the dinner group and get a little work , (ha ha Yelping)lol, on my comp. And I should have worn my swimsuit and misty mate. It was incredibly hot, and I understand we live in AZ but it was unbearable. They are aware so they have put in these huge loud windy fans. which i felt I had no choice but to sit my them in order to not pass out. Only to have my hair blowing all over making it difficult to eat.  Wi-fi- OOOHHHHH wait there is none . I just feel in this type of environment it is a must, if they want to compete with Paradise Bakery at all.  Nom Noms- after wanted a hot sandwich but too warm so I went with a make my own salad, if i remember correctly, i got a choice of lettuce and up to 7 mix ins, which was the only good part. Lots of options to pick from,and knowing i made my own selections i cant complain about the overall taste. However i used 3 options for additional eggs, but no request for EGGSHELLS, which i received.:(  Service- with me being the only one in the place, it took about 2-3 minutes for any acknowledgment. which it a while if your just standing in a hot place.  Break it down girl- With places such a Tossed and Paradise bakery, and now even Wendy's offing huge healthy Salad options and lower prices, I will not go back.

Went there for lunch today and had the absolute best oysters I have ever had. Half dozen from the east coast delish! I also had the tuna tartine which was great also I had to push aside the olive side but I am just not an olive fan.   My boyfriend got a chicken dish ,poulet something and gobbled it up! We both ended up fighting over the grilled corn with creme it was so so good! The service also  MAde it very worth while , I asked for sangria which they didn't have however he offered to make me one and it was delish!   No complaints will definatly come back!

I have visited here for lunch on a sat afternoon. After waiting for a  very long time , having to ask if we have a server, a kid came up who , i hope, was on his first day. We ordered drinks and lunch.   Caeser salad , dressing on side. add chicken.  I ordered coffee and chicken kabob things.   Dressing came on salad, ALLERGY!!! chicken things came deep friend and gross.   PLUS THERE WAS A HAIR IN THE SALAD.   We had high hopes for this great sounding spot with such a good location. We were very much let down. We have tried to try a different spot in scottsdale alomost every weekend we are in town and cannot say a bad thing about any except this one. very disappointing.   having read another review I may steer clear of fusion.

We noticed a sign on the Optima,(where we live) which we had no idea it was even there. Decided to go check it out. We sat at the high top overlooking the kitchen , which was very nice to see how clean it was.   Once handed the menu we were obviously confused,( you will know what i mean if you go in,) it is similar to a sushi restaurant as far as you get a piece of paper that you check off. How many courses and what you DONT Eat. After that its all the chefs say.  It was really fun not knowing what you were going to get and after your first course you are really sitting ther with your mouth water.   We got a seven course dinner or maybe five?? With a wine pairing. Everything was fantastic, I didnt care fore the braised pork thing with bacon but it was good just not my cup of tea with all the fat.   The Chef was wonderful to explain what we were eating and why it works and the idea behind it. I recommend sitting at the kitchen seats just for that.  The desert was the best I have ever had. It was a honey custard pudding sauce?? not too sure on how to describing it but I really didnt want to swallow any of my food so it would never end.    As a bonus if you live at the optima they will deliver it to the condo. yum!

I live 1/2 in Michigan & 1/2 in Scottsdale, that being said the similar style of yogurt place in Mi is 60 cents an ounce! So Price is great here in AZ.  I  think the amount of flavors is wonderful, anything from Peppermint(seasonal), Plain tart (my fav), Coffee, Peanut butter & Pistachio to name a few.   The best part is Some times I want a chocolate style concoction with peanuts, chocolate, marshmallows etc, And sometimes I want a tart fruity blend, I can have both here I simply get to separate bowls of a little of both. I was there in saturday and my first bowl was $181 and my second bowl was .79 cents . Can you beat that anywhere?  Did i mention unlimited toppings ( although you pay for what you pick in the end. If nothing else the ice cold complimentary straw berry water is great.   Can beat it . i try to go back as often as possible.

Hidden Gem of Scottsdale!!  I have no idea how I wave walked and driven past this place so many times without noticing it. Luckily I did, checked it out on Yelp! and decided to have lunch/brunch for two on Sat midday. we waked in to a very lovely patio and inside a small but nice restaurant.  It had  fun paintings on the wall, several small tables and a full bar with French music playing.   Not big on too much French words I had to guess what was what and we went ahead and ordered. Our Cheese plate was wonderful although I thought it took a little to long to come out, being it was a cheese plate and there was only 2 other people in the place.   It was very good and i highly recommend it!

I have have been here just once but looking forward to my next time later this week!  I went there wit a small group and was very impressed walking in side. It feels like it didn't belong in a mall , even Fashion Square! It is visually stunning! The bar is great for moment and being able to enjoy drinks before your meal.   We had just slightly slow service but in a new place I wont complain , they are still getting in together. The food made up for it Everything on our table was devoured . I could have eaten the corn for the rest of my life!  After dinner , we were joined but a few more friend and decided to have  cocktails on the patio , which again stunning!!  I have no complaints for Modern Steak and look forward to showing our out of town guests of about 20 this week.!!!

Sat at the bar. The bartender was awesome. Food was ok. Will go back but wouldn't bring out of town guests there as the food was average. The phone was constantly ringing was my only complaint. They do have a patio which is a huge plus! They do give you bread with balsamic and oil before your meal which i am not normally a fan of , however it was very fresh. Again with out the funny bartender, who was very personable and engaging even though we were not drinking, made our night.

One of the best happy hours!  the look- Its kinda stark?, Im not sure if I want to use that but I will, when you walk in, seems dark. I always wander over to the bar and enjoy the open area and large windows.its always freezing in there bring a hoodie.  Tender of the bar- not bad but not fun and talkative either, so depending on your mood, could make or break you visit. Lots of brews on tap to choose from including Rouge dead guy ale.  Food- all of the food here is incredible, however the meatballs are out of this world ! dont leave without trying them.. don't you do it!! plus they are only 3 bucks on happy hour.  break it down Jess- simply great, wish it was closer to home.

I noticed the sign up about a week or two ago and was excited to see new places open p and as very eager to check out what look like a very chic tanning spot!  I finally made it in and was very impressed the staff was very nice and showed me around to all of the very col looking beds and also the area where to get pedicures and nails. I was also excited to find out they do teeth whitening.  In addition I couldn't stop looking around a the stunning white silver style of the place the wallpaper and chandeliers were gorgeous you felt like a hot new hotel lobby more than a tanning salon.  Also I like they provided eye wear and deodorant in your room.  Although some of the packages where higher than I thought they should be i did sign up for the $25 package of unlimited tanning and also enjoyed it there so much I decided to get a pedicure.   I was checked on a few times to make sure I was enjoying myself and was offered a delicious glass of " Dirty Blond " Champagne .  I cant wait to take my girlfriends there .

This spot is the standard chinese food spot. nothing to special but nothing wrong. I randomly felt like chinese and have driven by this place a thousand times so wandered in. Seems family owned.  We got a non-menu item, lo mein noodles with sheshwan sauce. I got sweet and sour pork combo. soooo the combo not only came with my pork but also crab puffs, rice, an eggroll, lo mein noodles, it was crazy for 7.50.  cant go wrong if your in the mod for some cheap chinese.

My Overview- I went there with my boyfriends for a couple of drinks before we actually went out for the night. Not really sure what to expect, we were very surprised to see how cool and "ultra" it was , from the out side it reminds me of a basic everyday hotel but stepping inside its like walking into a hip vegas hotel. As I spend a lot of time at The W in Scottsdale , it reminded me of a sister to it! So we checked out the place , nice furniture , patio with fire, whoo hooo! BE sure to order the Bubbletini ! We had such a good time we ended up staying the whole night! Awesome times! Hidden fun  that I hope people discover!

Alright , now This is a BAR! whoo hoo.  We decided to stop here as we waited until our reservations at another restaurant and walked up to the bar.   Scene- Walking in your overwhelmed with bright reds, loud music and the hustle and bustle, in a good way. Very active social bar scene.  We didn't eat on this visit, but having been here before I can tell you the eats are on point and always fresh.  Staff- The bartenders were very interactive and talkative . I asked about some interesting bottle that drape the back walls that I was unfamiliar with and they were more than happy to spend some time to talk and explain what they were and what drinks they are in, even though it was busy.  Overall, a great drink spot.

went over of my my way to visit based on a suggestion from my little bro.   The scene- walking in it looked very friendly and clean a little stark bu nice and modern. The music didnt make any sense in the place . weird, felt like it didnt belong.  Flovors- ok so yes they did have several flavors but was disappointed that there went really too many that i thought would mix well. although they have aoatmeal cookie that was dead on to the real thing ,I wasnt too impressed by the flavors which, didnt have anything unique.  Top of the morning'- the toppings were quite spectacular , mainly the sauces, frosting,mallow cream, nutella, all kinds of yummy toppings and my bestest Nochi, i think thats it( little powdery mallows)  Counter Lady- was helpful and nice, the oly thing she was explaining the way it works to a group in friont, but she controls the samples so we had to wait a bit and the people behind us even longer. I must say while there wasnt custmers she was cleaning and arranging the toppings so it was very nice to see staff working, not just texdting behind the corner, looked like she had pride in her job.  Break it down Jess- I will return to Yogurtology if in the area and in the mood, however having drove 10 miles just to try it, I wasnt super impressed but if you like the self servestyle, its a go!

Thought I would enjoy it quite a bit better than I did.  BARSTAFF-Right off the bat we sat at the bar, in the food for some conversation, that usually comes from the bartenders at any place, however after having two menus thrown down with out anything being said, it started off very unwelcoming. Without the help of , what seemed to be the manager, the bartender girl never said one word to us except" see ya" as we got up.( the manager did everthing from take orders and make drinks, but seemed annoyed like she didnt want to be helping the obviously slow bartender)  Chow & Grub- Truffle parm fries were tastly,but take off the top ten fries and it looked like the bottom of the barrel , just crumbs and bits.My guy ordered the Samburger which he devoured,(literally, breathe baby!!) so thumbs up there! I oredered the Roasted chicken salad , that comes with pomagranate seeds and goat cheese. It was delish! I would high highly recommend this.  The Look- standard clean fresh peppy, Fox place, nothing stand out. Clean and fresh. Good looking staff. :)  Break it down Jess- Given the greatness of my salad I want to give this more stars but the bad service and attitude was just too awful. It seems like a fun and fresh( yes I have said that) place and didnt pull its weight with such bad staff. The salad could be gotten elsewhere.

So fun and yet quite different from the original Vig.   Surrondings- You cant help but love the fact that the bar staff has a shake weight behind the bar! The white board wall is a total hoot by the end of the night, anything from robots , birthday shout outs, and a overly clever dog with a monocle.  Food- If you dont have the Deconstructed fish taco you are not living. I am not a fish taco or taco salad kind of person but this .. this.. this.. is just so good! also i heard the burger rocks.  Staff- although it took a bit for the bartender to get behind the bar, i may have been in during the shift change, she was right there the whole time i was there. always eager to make me smile and get me what I needed.  Cocktail and applesauce-(minus the applesauce)- I have had many on the specialty drink menu and all are good nothing spectacular, n=but decent although kinda on the pricy side.  Overall- You will have good eats and good fun no matter midday lunch or a night on the town.   P.S- if you go late on weekends be sure to dress up!

Fun!! couple of easy points: Good wine fair prices.  - Ill will swear to you that you will never have better chicken skewers in your life!!  - We sat at the bar but even the servers were still checking on us, and the bartender was AMAzing.  Best place in anthem by far.Good cheese plate as well, although I feel like goat cheese should be on there too.  We liked it so much we are going to a wine bar now in Anthem,az for cinco de mayo!!

Overwhemlingly yummy! Lots of options and a friendly staff, one thing makes this location stand out among other Yogurtologies (spell check that one) and all of the similare Frozen Yogurt places that have sprung up everywhere!  The Spot- tucked away next to a Safeway :( I have driven by it a thousand times and had no idea it was there! So get out there and show yourself !!Patio seating is very nice and there is alot of it!  Hired Help- The young lady who helped me was very friendly and as they do happy to help you with samples and an explaining how it all works out! Standard.  Frozen fun- I mixed peach and tart and it was great however I was bummed I wanted mango but however it was not frozen which was a bummer. They had several holiday flavors still available.Red Velvet cake is nice to see as a staple flavor.  Sprinkles(not cupcakes here folks!)- they do have all the standard candy, FRESH POMAGRANTE SEEDS!!!!! I spoke with the young lady and ask if they sit there and pick every single one out and she started laughing and said yeah with a chuckle:) but i could help but cover my food! it was amazing!  I be back a hundred more time. maybe just for the seeds!!

New place - " Perked " up my day!    Service- walking into an empty place is never fun, but my server"Hillary" walked right up and told me all about the place and, although not hungry made me feel like trying it out and having a bite. She was extreamly helpful and nice. an absolute delight!  The Looks- It was slightly hard what to think , it was very nice and clean, which is so very important, although I got a cool hipster vibe  then a everyday local diner vibe. I wasnt sure how to take it. But It was sill welcoming.  Grub a dub- The menu was very nice with lots of options to choose from , the standard stuff. All the breakfast and lunch basics and a few extras. No complaints!:) My food was fast, hot and super great! I am looking forward to having a second helping soon.   Break it down Jess- Over all it being a new place still has some kinks to work out. But as far as good food and good service I highly recommend it!! I was happy to find it there really is nothing like it in the area so its a good find.They do cage free eggs and local bought items. Also organic food. (mostly) . I hope to pull up a chair next to you soon.  * I filled out a comment card and received an email regarding everything I had mentioned rather quickly. I think this shows the dedication to making every guest welcome and not only does this show in the service but in the food as well. I hope its here to stay.

Gorgeous!!!  Food- eh, its OK ...as weird as it is to say this.. try the Brussels sprouts  Bar- Tom the bartender makes this place worth going to all by himself. hes over the top fun!! Good drinks fast!   I have been here several times and even though I didn't care for i at first they seem to be improving all of the things that seem to be off. Now even offering a complementary hummus bar during happy hour( which was not previously offered)

So nice to have a new type of environment to hang out in Scottsdale.  Decor - Its so clean and sophisticated sharp decor right when you walk in tn the door , you immediately want a drink when you see the beautiful bar in the center of the floor. OK OK I'm a little obsessed I know:) with good reason!!  Food- I have tried several things on the menu and was impressed with every hing ! LAMB BURGER!!! a must!!!  Service was friendly and professional. This place is here to stay !

My second home, no seriously , its that good! Cant say I was ever in the place before so I wont be making any comparisons.   Dough!- The pizza is perfect! I always get the personal size, with italian sausage and ricotta cheese. Its big for being a personal , I usually share it with my main man and it fits us perfectly, however I think for most people its not for splitting. Its thin crust , sorta similar to Grimaldis but better! and not as pricey. They seem to use a similar style bread on the spinach dip too and it melts in your mouth! noms!  Friends behind the bar- I have only been at the bar seats, but the servers are all friendly and happy to chat with you even when your not at their table. Bartenders are super awesome. All are fun and talkative. Making drinks quick and having a good conversation is hard to find!!  Wine bar?- The sign says Patio and wine bar, soooo it is.. but its very unpretentious , so if you are just getting into wine or are not at all , dont be shy come on in.. its not pricey and the guys are here to help! Plus a good selection of draft and bottle beers! If you like good wine, get in here! I you are a beer drinker, get in here! If you just like a goo place with good friend and soda, get in here!  Break it down Jess- All in all its a great place, half price wine bottles on Wednesday, and a great happy hour. My only thought that if you go to this wine bat for a bottle of wine with friends for a quite time, dont go during any sporting events as there are tons of tv's( which is great) but could easily turn into a guys bar during those times. But I love this place!!!!!!  See you there!!!

Oh where to begin the goodness!  The spot: the building is very eye catching right off the bat. Walking in it gorgeous!! stunning suedeish white seat that were super comfy. I love the open kitchen and the awesome draft beer pipe haning from the ceiling was rad.  Grubs: We had a huge meal starting with the meat and cheese plate that was amazing . I had read the menu on line about the deviled eggs and I was so excited about, and they came through, I could have ordered four orders as my meal :)), then we had the brussels ceaser and also a beet and goat cheese salad(.i have actually gone back again for that salad) followed by a fall apart(in a good way) milk braised pork shoulder and the pork belly . The sauce from the pork belly was sent straight from heaven. finally some pudding and the bananas foster  , which is anything but standard, lil bananas hot stuffed donut things.. noms noms!  Cocktails were spot on , lots of options that include sparkling wine, which I love in my cocktails!  I have already gone back and look forward to checking out the happy hour next.  Killer food , drinks and service!  Oh yeah get a spot outside on the patio its beautiful!
