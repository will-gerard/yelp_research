I love this place. The atmosphere and decor is simple but nice - very comfortable. The staff always make me feel so welcome when I'm there. It seems to be a family-run operation and the ladies working there seem to enjoy their jobs and have fun.  I've come here many times on my lunch break, and they always get my food out really quickly and it comes out just as I've ordered. My two favorite dishes are the Ginger Queen and Pad Thai. Both are served piping hot with super-fresh veggies and the perfect amount of heat (I go for medium spicy). The flavors are perfect and the Pad Thai isn't oily at all like at some Thai restaurants. Portions are absolutely perfect: enough for a single meal if you're REALLY hungry or enough to take a little home for a second small meal.  This is a simple, consistently-yummy, well-run restaurant. They know what they're doing and I'll continue to be a regular!

After an evening at the Duce, when I told my husband about this place, I felt like "Stefan" from SNL (Please note that all of the below are 100% true from my single 3-hour visit):  "Phoenix's new hotspot is called, 'The Duce.' They have EVERYTHING - wedding rehearsals, sorority costume date parties, fancy fruit drinks in mason jars, old refrigerators, a boxing ring, 13-year-old youth group members dancing to the oldies, hula hooping, lots of signs written on chalkboards, local celebrity Lin Sue Cooney, a newborn baby, an indoor food truck that takes 70 minutes to serve a hamburger, karaoke, a giant gift shop, ice cream floats, and lots of bearded twentysomethings."   I see how this COULD be fun, in theory. However, in practice, there was just way too much going on and this place can't seem to figure out what it is. It honestly seemed like someone spent about a month pinning everything they saw on Pinterest and just threw it into a single location.  All this said, at 35, I'm probably older than their target demographic, so maybe I'm just crotchety and out of touch. :)

I'm willing to chalk my bad experience up to "working out the kinks", but still don't think I'll be back.  The good news: The place was packed on Friday night at dinner time. I got my food to go and the staff were very polite and accommodating. The food was hot and the salsa that came with it was great.  The bad news: I ordered a chicken torta for my husband and got beef instead. I ordered a vegetarian burrito for myself and there was A) a big piece of meat in it and B) a long hair in the center. That ended dinner pretty quickly for me.  Disappointing...I was hoping this would be a great new go-to local place.
