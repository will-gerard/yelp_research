The food is over priced. The restaurant has no place to sit indoors.  The exteror tables aren't even covered by a shade structure to protect you during the middle of the day when they are open.  They have limited hours. The food its self its okay, but I could get the same thing for a lesser price else where. they charge you per item, even the salsa 15cents for 1oz and 50 cents for 4oz.  No way!  Never returning here.

Food - ok. If you are looking to just build your own salad. One premixed option. Watery mac n cheese. Cheep tacobell tacos. The flavor is ok. The soup is not hot, like it should be. Ambient- the place would be nice, if they would clean up more frequently. Casual. Modern. Service- nonexistent. They take your money and off you go. They will occasionally come buy to pick up your plates. Asked one of the waiters there if they could reheat my soup because it eas cold. She said "I'm sorry, but we have no where to do that. We only have stoves." Price- 6.99 adult... + drink. I don't feel I got what I paid for.

Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky, thick cut, with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food.

Great place to fill your self with veggies and soups and so much more. Yummy! For me its a little pricey, so I always come prepared with a coupon on hand. They come once a month in your mailbox. Else sign up and get your coupons electronically and you are set. You basically save on cost of the beverage, but every dollar counts.

Wow! I am amazed! I just had my tooth pulled today and my dentist called to check up on me. Who does that? This dentist, along with an emergency phone contact incase of anything. Definately impresed.

Love the Phat ti. (Pad Tie)? That's how it sounds. :-P  Ambient - Walls and decar are all pretty much thai inspired.  Red table cloths and golden accents all around.  Dim lighting, coozy, booths and tables.  Service - They are for the most part very attentive and friendly.  Food - LOVE LOVE their pad ti or is Phat tai, well how ever it is spelled.  IT is DELICIOUS.  We have tried other places and its just not the same.  This is the place for Pad Tie! :-P

Love their White Pizza.  Their two slices and a soda combo, great value.  And extreemly delicious!   The place is quite small indoors, but in a pinch you can sit out doors and people watch or take it to go.

Location- easy to find and plenty of parking Ambiance- casual, clean, and sensible. Although the owner is continuously trying to modernize the place. Service- friendly. You order upon entering find a table and it will be taken to you. Usually a 5 to 10 min wait to get your food depending what was ordered. Food- Delicious! They have a simple menu, with much variety of choices: gyros, burger, hot dog, greek pizza, pasta, and salads. I enjoy that you can choose a salad as a side vs french fries.

Plenty of choices in meat and salsas. They have barbacoa like that of chihuhua, mexico. One of the only places I know. Delicious!   You can see them cooking up the meet from where you order and they have a place facing the dining area where someone is making the tortillas fresh. How awesome.  The have tostadas to snack on, and plenty of salsa to choose from their Salsa and Toppings Bar.   they give you a number and then they bring your meal to your table.  I go there for the tacos, but they also have enchiladas, burritos, flan, rice, beans (refried and ranchero), and so much more.  Highly recommend!  Casual Dinning.

The green chile burrito was different from what I've had in the past. They use oregano vs cumin to flavor the meat. I can't say I'm in favor of it.

Wow! What a line! I now its good, but wow! They are working hard to get all those orders out. Check In 7:08PM. Order 7:12PM, food in hand 7:21pm. That's pretty good for the massive rush they had.

Food was delicious and the portions are considerable.  I enjoyed the daily special of stacked green enchiladas with shredded beef.  The beans served were whole and well seasoned.  The rice was tasty and had the texture of uncle ben's rice.  It was still good though.  The guac was fresh and delicious.  The salsa not so spicy, but good.

Ambient - Casual   Service - Quick, Friendly and Easy.  Food - I enjoy their chocolate chip cookeis and their Chicken Walnut Salad Sandwich.  Although one thing that I do not like is that their soups are not made their fresh.  They are good, but somehow I expected that they made their own soups. :-/

Location- easy to get too if going west on main, but east on main because of the metro and construction is a little bit of a pain. Plenty of parking. Its in a little shopping center.  Ambiance- casual, nice, clean, handycap accessible. Service- friendly! Welcome to planet smoothie at your entrance and have a nice day going out. Walk to the register to order find a table and they will bring it to you.  Food- Simple and Delicious! They have obviously smoothies, but they also have salads, sandwhiches, and wraps. I am personally a regular. The price is on the money and food for being so simple is quite delicious! Love their in house dressings. Meals come with a choice of side and a cookie, with the exception of the salad.

One of my favorite places close to home. tortas (Mexican style sandwiches).  Love the tortas of turkey butt (colita de pavo) delicious with the fresh avacado.  Yum!  My mouth salivates just thinking about it. Love there salad at the restaurant, the take home... it seams, its not the same.  Love their daily soup with a side of their in house potato chips.  The potatoe chips taste like salt and vinegar. Delish!  The chile verde burrito has great flavor, while I'm not a big fan of their red.  The place is very casual.  You can also get some ice cream and fresh fruit drinks like melon, fruit punch, horchata, etc. Oh, there are great sweet treats!  You order, pay and sit.  They will call your number once it is ready.  One thing though... be ready to grab your drink, if fresh fruit drink, if you don't take it someone else will gladly take it for you. :-P

The place was very nice clean, buddist zen feel, with relaxing soft music. Gave great instructions on how to get there and how to make my experience more relaxing through his insight. Did a great job, profesional, and also had a relaxed and focused way. Recomend it.  Massage is with clothes on and in a room with the rest of the other clients. FYI.  This was a little wierd for me, but it was good.

Food is simple and delicious! Get ready to get your hands dirty. There's no forks necessary here.  Rotiserie chicken, a simple salsa, warm tortillas, and canned/bottled drink. Love it! The salsa is simple and tangy. It can hardly be called spicy, but quite tasty. They also have roasted jalapenos, pickled purple onion, and go at it.  When you order your options are a whole chicken or 1/2 chicken. The cook will chop it into pieces for you.   The place is covered with the color orange, casual, indoor and outdoor dinning with a small tv for a spanish soap opera.

Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised at the food served. It was awesome!  The meal ordered included: 1/2. Dozen oysters, fish in a white sauce with mushrooms, and five shrimp tacos. The service was ok.  The place was clean and they apperently have kareoke. The juke box took us by surprise for out of nowhere it started playing some banda music and a ciuple of spanish clasics.  Price well as all seafood places... its a little higher than regular mexican food dishes, but overall acceptable. The highest dish at around $12.50. The 1/2 dozen oysters where fresh and served on a plate of Ice and slices of lime. Delicious. Taste of the sea. Oh,  how I missed the short lived taste and experience. The shrimp tacos, where ok. The shrimp was well cooked,  the only thing that I would say needed improvement was the tortilla. The taco fell apart at yoour hands. The fish in a white sauce with mushrooms could only be described as creamy goodness. Loved it! It was a delight! The sauce was a light chese, green chile, and mushroom white sauce. Not spicy, but savory. Highly recomd it. The rice was light and had a. Great flavor as well the refried beans, which were made from scratch.

LOVE, there mango habanero!  A mix of spicy and sweet.  The wings were pretty big about 4" for the wing and a little less for the mini leg looking one.  Enjoy my wings with a side of buffalo chips (french fries in a round shape) and some blue cheese.   There hot are pretty tasty too.  Do not like the carabean jerk, those to me are pretty gross, but some of my friends do like them. I saw give it a try.   Also a great place to catch the game or simply play some trivia.

Love their hot sauce. A little habanero mixed in delish! Plenty of TVs with various sports games. Catch a drink. Great place to come after work.   During lunch food to table takes a little long, go only if you have more than on hour lunch to spare.  Have some decent happy hour specials.

The dining area is clean and classy with gold and warm tones accentuated with black. A few thai Buddha's, picture of the thai royalty, but all in good measure. They also have a couple of tv screens, so we were able to see the World Cup while we ate.   Service, was good, kind and straight to the point. Then again we were the only ones there.   Food, was delicous! I had the papaya salad. First time trying it out. Asked for it medium heat. It had all the staples of thai cusine sour, sweet, salty, bitter and spicy. It had great bite in both heat and texture. The papaya was shredded like noodles. Zesty lime, jalapeno, thai chile. Wow!  The pad thai too, medium heat. Just remember that when you order it, it only comes with tofu. If you want an additional protein like: chicken, shrimp, etc. You need to ask for it. It comes with a lime wedge, spring onions and peanuts on the side. It had great sauce coverage. It had the great flavors of sour, sweet, and spicy. Delicious!  Price was great. Between me and my husband. The two plates mentioned above with thai tea about $30ish with taxes not including tip. Not bad.  We will surely be back.

Location- easy to find and plenty of parking Ambiance- casual with picnic looking tables. Its bbq it works.  Service- good. Friendly. Walk to the counter order and then pick up food at counter when ready. Food- it tasted ok, but then got sick.   This establishment is now closed as of a few months. (Catching up on reviews.)

My experience was not a pleasent one. Location - plenty of parking Atmosphere- a little cramped, but efficient use of space in number of tables. Went early lunch 11:30 no one else there (customers) Service- took awhile to be attended, only one person. He was busy doing something else. Upon ordering some enchiladas the gentleman proceeds to tell me that there are no tortillas.  I personally was in shock to here this, since it is a mexican restaurant and tortillas are a staple ingridient to the cuisine. After waiting for 15 min to receive my food. The gentleman sais that they found some. And after another 15 min get my food. Food-it was ok. Nothing great to talk about.

The Meal.  The lava sauce was spicy: heat and smokiness; great stuff. The potato jack enchiladas Christmas style with Chihuahua Cheese and topped with freshly made sour cream was DELISH!  I enjoyed the oven where they heat up your clay dish holding your enchiladas; it is brilliant!  The only thing that I think could be improved upon, meal wise, is the corn tortilla itself.  The tortilla was too thick, which led to it unrolling while it was being prepared and while eating it.  I think if they were to make it just a little thinner, it would make the tortilla hold its shape better.  Service.  It's still their first week.  They were nice and ready to answer questions, but a little slow getting ready for the lunch time crowd.  It was fine, we weren't in a rush, but one thing to improve is have one person for each station.  While I was attended there were multiple people, some unsure where to go and what to do, and only a couple of people preparing the dish, which led to a bit of chaos and time delay in the kitchen side.    Ambiance. The place was nice, clean, modern, and casual. Love it! Especially the light fixtures! The patio outside was great!  Maybe one thing to consider is add a couple of those pavers from your patio exit to the north parking lot  along the gravel garden, you know to reduce people walking all over your rock and ruining the wonderful landscaping.    Portion. The two enchilada plate did not fill the stomachs of my coworkers, nor mine, we filled our cups twice with beverage and that held us over.  One of the guys did get a three enchilada plate with a drink and that did the trick for him.

The place is clean, samples are available at the counter and upon request.  They have a lunch menu, but I was only there to check out their meat.  I tried the spicy hungarian and that was delish! It was smokey and spicy.  I took some canadian bacon and som capicolla? Both very tasty.
