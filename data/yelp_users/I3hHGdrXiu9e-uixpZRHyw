After spending one night at the Imperial Palace (Never Again) and two nights at Hooters, anything looks good. If your traveling for business then this place isn't a bad choice. Nice rooms with decent decor, a hd tv, safe, and iPod dock. Not to mention the beds are very comfortable. Im pretty sure the price here is reasonable, because our company wouldn't have paid for it otherwise.

I hate this place so much. The company I work for puts us here because it's cheap. Everything about it I can't stand. The lay out of this place sucks!!!!!!! It's like frickin shoots and ladders! And the whole place smells like crap. My whole experience here wasn't good.

Based solely on the fact that you can get the cheapest meal in town( a fat hot dog and a soda for $1.50) deserves 5 stars.

Great food! My lady had the chicken fried rice which was awesome. I had the green curry which was really good. Not the best I've ever had but really good. And it was alot of food too. I love leaving with left overs :)
