We have been going to Ah So for years and have never had a bad experience.  The sushi is always fresh and tastes great.  The teppanyaki tables are always fun and they give you too much food.    Stop on by and see for yourself.

If you are looking for a fast wash, this is not your place. 2 hours to get your car washed?   No oil change.  No detail. Just a wash.  Don't know how they stay in business.  Still waiting.
