Love it. Great service, great food, great staff, I'll eat here any time I get the chance. Whoever the manager/owner is that normally is at the front is great!

Order placed at 950. 1030 rolls around with no contact made. Turns out they "ran out of bread" when we called asking what was going on. The attitude we received was unlike anything I've had from Jimmy Johns in all the times I've gone there. When asked for the name of the person we were talking to, we got a laugh and "ocean tide".  Not only will we not be eating at Jimmy Johns again, I will not be using them to cater the events I throw for work on a weekly basis. I'm sure Jersey Mikes or even Subway (ugh) can fill the void.   I understand things happen, but the complete lack of accountability, dismissal of concerns, zero effort put forth to contact us, and the attitude and lack of a single "sorry" was super lame.
