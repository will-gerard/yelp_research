Just used these guys for a house we bought. Excellent service. I thought the inspector was professional and extremely knowledgeable. I got the report the same day and it was great. Highly recommend.

Great discovery! Small local family owned, say Hi to George when you go. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but the food is fantastic, authentic and very fairly priced. Service is great. We will be eating here as often as possible. Highly recommend! Oh, try the Greek Salad with chicken.

You know, I have never been disappointed at Harold's. The BBQ is always great. The fish tacos my wife says are the best. But today for the first time we had breakfast there. Excellent. Try the pork chop & eggs. Amazing!

I keep trying but not anymore. The food is just okay, the service is not okay. Over priced. Not sure what I could recommend if anything. Their guacamole is good, and a fair price.

Love this place! Great food at fair prices. Excellent service. But unless your into a more mature singles scene don't go on Friday or Saturday nights.

Awesome surprise! Drove by it a few times before deciding to try it. Weird location & strange layout, but if you can get past that, the food is great! I've tried several things but you can't beat the pulled pork. The mac & cheese is awesome too. Very very fair pricing. One of the better BBQ I've had in Phoenix. Recommend!

Love it here. Excellent food. Very good service. Cold beer. Wings are awesome. Tv's everywhere. Great for watching any sport. If you really care make a reservation.

Ok.. I've only been once, if I go again this review may change. Love the atmosphere & the location. The service was good, not great. But the most important thing is the food. Four out of the four of us weren't nuts about our food. Very disappointing. The waiter recommend the special to me with great enthusiasm so that's what I got. I didn't like it at all. Pork on the bone. I came really close to sending back but I didn't want it to effect the night.   With so many options in this town, unless your just going for drinks I can't recommend this place. Oh FYI. Too expensive.

Try the Butter Chicken! You'll love it. Fun menu. Excellent service. I've tried many dishes but keep coming back to the butter chicken. The quality of the food is high

I want to rate higher but just can't. The food is ok, except the Nachos which are amazing, the service is ok, but the prices (for what you get) are too high. Can't really recommend.

Really good food at a fair price. Service was top notch, very friendly. Not sure with the word Taco in their name you would try anything else, but looking forward to going back.

Yup. Gotta try it out. Too much fun even if you don't play golf. Bring your friends hang out have a drink. Prices very fair. Apps are excellent.
