First off I would have never found this if it wasn't for yelp so thanks for that. It is not seen from the road and is located behind the arcadia ice rink.   Second, pretty bitchin place. All of the reviews are accurate about the plexi glass wall viewing of the rink. Its interesting and I have never seen anything like it.   Third, they have live local bands on Friday and Saturday night for a low $4. It is noisey so if your looking for a quiet time I don't recommend it for you.   Last but not least, cheap drinks and nice tender!!

I am new to the area and I wanted a dive bar night. I hit Yelp up to help me find a few places, this was one of them.  I had chose 3 from yelp to go to in one night and this was my second stop. It is not as divey as the previous reviews in my opinion. It is clean, well lit, and the furniture is in good condition. These qualities are opposite of a dive bar. It seemed to me that the customers were all regulars. there is one pool table in the center of the bar and a jukebox. Someone thought we would all enjoy three 311 songs in a row. Not so much.   The beer specials are great. i don't think I will be returning, the stares from the regular customers made me uncomfortable and the only thing dive bar about it is the stinky bathroom.

I work in this area and have become a regular here. I am usually not a fan of Panda but the food at this location seems to be more fresh that others. The staff is always friendly and offer you to try their new dish. I wanted some rangoons but I like them fresh out of the cooker. When i hesitated the gentleman offered to throw some fresh one in for me at bring them to my table. This is not typical of a fast food place.

My sister has ranted about Cibo for weeks now, and how much she LOVES it. So needless to say I was excited to find out that one of our friends was having a group birthday dinner here this weekend.   The decor of Cibo is so cute and charming. The lights outside on the trees are a good addition to outside lighting. The environment is good for a date night, wine night with girlfriends, or family dinner.   Since this was a large birthday dinner we were seated outside. When we first arrived there were no seats available for my sister and I. While they figured out how to add a few extra seats we decided to go inside to order a drink from the bar. While standing at the bar our waitress from outside came up to us (who we had not even seen yet) and "barked" at us that we can order drinks from outside. She then very RUDELY asked what can she get us. We order our drinks and my sister proceeded to ask her is we can start a tab, she again barked at us and said NO they don't do tabs. I could not believe how rude she was being. My sister casually said "ok I will pay cash, I feel like I am starting to annoy you" Her response was "ok thanks"!!!! I was appalled!!   Once we got seated outside the waitress' rude behavior continued. She just kept barking things at the guests, such as "are you ready to order?" in the rudest tone of voice! It was not just us, I witness her rudeness towards other guests at the table. My boyfriend ordered a beer and she brought the wrong one out. I corrected her and she says "oh we were out of that one, but this beer is pretty much the same thing". I am sorry but when is it EVER acceptable to do this. The correct thing would to come back tell the guest and recommend the similar beer or ask if there is anything else they would like.   Through out the time she continue to reach over guests without saying excuse me. I witnessed her spilling water on a guest without apologizing. I realize we were a larger party but if you cannot handle it ask for help or trade tables with someone. I am sorry you got the largest table in the place and made a hefty tip (not from me however)   The ONLY reason I rated Cibo a 4 instead of a 2 was because their food really was fantastic and my sister promises that she has never received anything less than great service from the waiters.   Recommendation to Cibo, fire your bitchy server I have NEVER received worse service in my life!! Being so rude to your guests is not good for your business!

All i can say is DELICIOUS!! Everything i have had here is so good. they have a great selection of drinks and a variety of menu items for what ever you may be in the mood for. you cant beat their happy hour of 1/2 off apps and drink specials. their jalapeno app is amazing. the bartender makes great drinks including the "Kenny Margarita" this is to die for. it states on the menu "limit is two" that should give you an idea of how potent they are. the service is always friendly and quick.   I recently went for dinner and had their carne asada entree and it became my new favorite thing on the menu!!

Me and the boyfriend were going on a date night to Postino for their $20 bottle if wine a bruchetta deal. The wait was 40 minutes so we decided to go have a drink at LGO while we waited.  We sat at the Chefs table and were greeted by our server Emma, I must say Emma was the nicest server. We asked her a ton of questions about what her favorite dishes were for when we come back. She was so helpful.  We ordered a bottle of wine, its a much better deal than a glass. They sell wine in their shop next door. You buy the bottle at retail price and there is no corking fee. We got a bottle for $13!! You cannot beat that.  After chatting with Emma for a while and seeing the food around us we ended up taking our name off the list at Postino. (we still love you Postino the wait was just too long).  Emma recommended the Padres pizza which is not on the menu. It was delicious. No sauce, four cheese blend, prosciutto, and fig! The salty/ sweet combo is great!!  We started with the Shrimp Ceviche and it was the best I have had!! The shrimp was plump and not sparse in the dish.  LGO had a warm, cozy environment that is inviting. Emma was fantastic! The food was yuuummyy!! We cant wait to go back and try a different kind of pie!

I am not sure I went to the same place as all the other reviews due to the fact nothing is fantastic here except Pavle the server. He was funny, kind and attentive.   Six of us came here for a late night dinner. We ordered several different things on the menu and shared. I was not impressed with one thing i tried, and most of our group felt the same way. The blossoms were luke warm and over fried. The salame sandwich which was described as cheesy goodness barely had any cheese on it. I ordered the butterscotch pudding which was described as "to die for, people rave about it". The pudding was gritty, chalky tasting and not good at all.   The best thing that several of us enjoyed was the random cookie that came with the sandwich. This should not be the case.   Pavle was so kind and took the dessert of my tab. The service was great but for the price and the taste of food, I will not be returning to FnB

Tried Smashburger for the first time and it was AMAZING. For a fast, but not too fast food burger it is spot on. I asked the cashier her opinion on what to get and she was kind and honest. I ordered the Arizona burger and was not disappointed. YUM YUM YUM!!
