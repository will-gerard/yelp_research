The staff appears to made up of crusty old veterans who think they can treat the world anyway they want to because of their veteran status (they all had veteran hats on, not Great Eagle Golf Course hats.) They were rude at the cart and bag check, rude at the front counter, rude course marshal told us our foursome was playing to slow because the 3 little old ladies were playing from the front tees and always waiting on us even though we kept pace with the group in front of us and finished our round in EXACTLY 4 hours, 18 minutes. Nobody there to greet us as we made the turn, no one there to take the cart when we finished. Not sure why anyone would hire and keep such nasty staff like that. They must work for free in exchange for free golf. Played on a warm day in February....should be the pinnacle of course conditions right? Nope....greens were horrible, inconsistent, patchy, uneven. The greens' grass had splotchy dead spots everywhere, every putt bounced and changed directions multiple times. Bunkers had minimal sand.....you basically hit out of the mud. Fairways were unnecessarily narrow so they didn't have to overseed to much. Never saw a beverage cart. Will never golf here again.

Not sure what the all the hype is about. The a-la-cart style gets really expensive, really quick. If I want to pay $30 for a pizza I would most certainly expect it to come out NOT burnt to a crisp. I like a thin crust NY style pie, but this is wafer thin yet had a huge fat  2 inch crust. Service is slow. Refills on drinks are virtually non existent. Staff is rude. They wouldn't let us push a few tables together to seat our entire party of 12. They said they already had 1 large party there and won't accommodate another? WHAT?I wonder if this is the same owner that used to be at 59th Ave north of the 101...that place was pathetic too. I'll take other NY style pizza places over this any day. Never, ever going back.

Went to a group family party here. So glad I wasn't paying. We sat and chomped on ice, had to wait forever on refills. Food was so-so...definitely not worth what the group ended up paying for. Once again, this place disappoints at every opportunity. Pizza crust is too thin and burnt and flavorless-unless you like charcoal. Even for free I was less than impressed.

Great food, reasonable value. Certainly will take this over the pre-packaged Italian food at the big corporate guys. Staff is friendly and owners are onsite working all the time. New location is very nice at 7th St & Union Hills, lots more availability for lunch seating vs. the original location.

They sold my sister old outdated equipment and put us on long term contracts for them. She wanted a Galaxy note for herself, and an Iphone for her daughter. They sold her a Galaxy Note 3, when the note 4 had already been out for 6 months. Her daughter's line was sold an Iphone 5....not a 5s or a 6, but 16g Iphone5 that had been out for 4 years already. Verizon directly was giving away this phone for FREE then, right now, they give you an Iphone5s for $1. Then they screwed up the contracts on 3 lines on our account. What a bunch of lying thieving shysters. Avoid at all costs, unless you want to be sold a 2004 version of a Blackberry.
