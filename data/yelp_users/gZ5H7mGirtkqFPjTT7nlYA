I'm usually a huge fan of In-N-Out, but today must've been just an off day for this restaurant. I had a double-double animal protein burger, animal style fries, and regular fries. Everything just seemed like tons and tons of salt was poured on it. It was way too salty. Next time, I will definitely ask for no salt on the fries. I recommend you do the same or ask for reduced salt.

It's definitely edible, but I don't think it was good. I probably won't return here. I had the tonkatsu ramen with original toppings. I was really disappointed with my dish. The ramen was grossly overcooked. The noodles had been over soaked with the broth and showed signs of being overcooked. The noodles were so swollen that they seemed to fall apart when you tried to pick it up for eating. The broth itself was nothing to brag about. I also ordered an egg for an extra cost. To my dismay, the egg was just a hardboiled egg rather than the soft cooked egg that usually comes with ramen. Also, I want to note that I love bamboo shoots. But, there was definitely too much bamboo shoots added as part of the original toppings. I do not recommend this restaurant and I will not be back.

Honestly, I'm not a fan of fast food. But, I will always be a fan of In-N-Out. I love trying different things off of their secret menu! But, I'm definitely a sucker for animal style burgers and fries. I tend to always get my burger as protein style. Also, I have to have a vanilla shake every time I come to In-N-Out. Coming from a state without In-N-Out, this place is a definite treat!

To be very honest, I don't think that Dunkin' Donuts had very good donuts. I would consider them average at best. Personally, I prefer Krispy Kremes. And I would probably give them a two star if I was rating this place solely on their donuts.   But, I have to admit that I highly enjoyed the hazelnut latte that I ordered the other night. I enjoy a nice, strong espresso flavor. That was executed fairly well in the latte I received. Also, I really liked how my latte wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I find that Starbucks tends to add way too much sugar/syrup. This causes their lattes to be sickeningly sweet. Yuck!   Also, I would like to note that I received excellent customer service from the two employees there that night. They were about to close, but they were happy to serve me. I think small talk is fine in certain situations. And this is one of them. I had very enjoyable small talk with these two here.   In summary, I would come here for coffee.

I have quite a bit of family in Phoenix. So, I generally frequent the area quite a bit even though I am from CO. But, this place definitely offers quick Chinese food if you're on the go. The food is pretty fresh and the taste is on point. The crab rangoons are quite tasty and I am always a fan of dumplings. I am also a huge fan of Chinese noodles. If you are in the area, you should definitely give this place a chance. It is definitely fair and I don't think you'll be disappointed with the taste. Oh, and the people that work the counter are incredibly friendly. Although they are lacking a bit in English skills, they definitely try their hardest to make it up in service!

I'm back in town in AZ and Yan's is always a pit stop that I need to make. On this trip, I had the chicken lettuce wrap with the crab rangoon. I really enjoy the filling that they use for the lettuce wrap because they include water chestnuts. The chestnut adds a wonderful crunch to the meal. I also enjoy how the seasoning for the lettuce wrap is just right. It is never too salty or too dry. The portion size also leaves plenty of food for leftovers. Being a college student, I love having leftovers. It really is great in my opinion. I also really like how they add celery to their lettuce wraps. In my experience, celery is not always an ingredient. But, I love the flavor of celery. Personally, I really love eating cream cheese. So, the crab rangoons resonate well with my personal tastes. But, I highly highly recommend them if you enjoy cream cheese and fried foods! Really tasty!   Yan's is a nice place to eat with very nice cashiers. They tend to remember you if you're a regular. They really are very nice even if it is a little bit difficult to understand them. If you're looking for an inexpensive bite to eat on the fly, please try Yan's.

I'm going to judge this review solely based off the macarons. The first macarons I've ever had were from KAK. Since my macaron experience at KAK, I can tell you that no other macaron has really compared. The price here is very fair. It's a little over a dollar for one macaron. This seems to be a very standard price nationwide for macarons. The size of these macarons is a little bigger than what I've found in Denver and in Houston. So, I can tell you that these are pretty good sized macarons. These macarons have a very fresh taste and the sweetness is perfect. They are not overly sweet and they are a perfectly light dessert. My favorite macaron that I bought here was the Early Grey. They have a great creaminess to the filling. I highly recommend them.

I came to the Corner in December for a wonderfu;  event. And I was super pleased with the venue. The Corner is a wonderful place to  check out for a nice meal! I will definitely try this place out whenever I'm back in town!   At this event, we had the option of trying out several foods they serve here. I really need to commend The Corner on their Southwester style salad. It was absolutely delicious and very fresh. I'm a huge fan of corn and avocados; both of which were both included in the salad. I also really like how their pizzas are quite unique, but still tasty. I'll always say yes if there is bacon on the pizza. I really recommend checking this place out. It is refreshing and seems pretty healthy! Happy holidays everyone!
