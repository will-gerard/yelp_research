I stopped in to get my  20 Month old son's haircut.  The only lady barber in the shop had a seat open and I plopped my boy in.  She did an amazing job with his hair and he looked quite slick and ready for school pics at daycare.  I decided to jump in and get my hair cut, since i was impressed. Miss Barber did a great job on my whig too.  I couldn't believe it, I looked like a sane man, that someone might even stop and ask directions from.  I wish I caught her name  but I will take my son back, when he and I can no longer stand our hair tickling our ears and necks.

I've had better BBQ from Famous Dave's.  I don't recommend and would suggest driving the extra distance to go somewhere else.

This is my Go-To place to relax and get a nice cut.  Staff is friendly.  Business is clean and manly-beautiful.  TV's at each station for the customer to watch.  It's a throwback to when Barbers took care of the customer.  Every man needs to try a good Barber Shop at least once and I recommend.

Seven Tattoo is the place to go for Custom Tattoo work.  Every Artist in there is very talented.  I only have work from Carl Grace and Joseph "Fanx", but  if I lived in Vegas I would have work from all their artist.  I'd give this place 3 thumbs up, but I only have 2 thumbs.  Stop by talk and plan your next tattoo from this shop, when you're in Vegas, Baby!

Great instruction by Ryan Beauregard.  Clean workout facility and friendly people.  They have a New Student membership for $60 per month and classes are Mon, Weds and Fri 6pm-7pm.  It's definitely worth the money if you want to learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  I usually go to classes on Mondays and Fridays, and it's the best workout I've had in years.
