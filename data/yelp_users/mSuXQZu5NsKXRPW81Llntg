This dog park is AWESOME!!  I love the lake, I love the giant, grassy field next to it, and I love bringing our labs here to play and swim.  They are soooo tired when we leave, too.  I just wish we lived closer, otherwise we would be visiting every day : )

My husband and I absolutely love this place.  From the front desk to the techs in the back, we have always had a positive experience.  Dr. Bower is the vet we usually see. I recommend him to everyone we know with a new pet. Our puppy is always treated so well. Each time we come here, we feel like the only patients in the building. They have no problem taking time to talk with us about anything we need to talk about. We even ask them training questions!  Usually dogs are hesitant to go to the vet...but not ours! I feel that the positive experiences we've had from the very beginning with Dreaming Summit Animal Hospital has taught our puppy that going to the vet is fun and adventerous.

This dog park is incredibly close to our home, so of course we chose to take our 5-month-old puppy here first.  Overall, I love this park best out of all the ones we have been to.   The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the people you occasionally encounter at this park.  Out of all the parks we have gone to, this is the one where the most incidents have happened.  We have only been going here for a couple weeks and witnessed quite a few run-ins among pet owners who simply don't follow the rules.  The good far outweighs the bad, though, and we have made a lot of friends here. So has our puppy!  We enjoy meeting up with the "regulars" and will definitely continue coming!

A few days ago, our 4 month old black lab was acting completely out of character. He was throwing up, moping around, and worst of all, we had found blood in his poop. Fearing the worst, my husband and I knew we needed to take him to an emergency animal hospital ASAP. I am SO glad we chose this place!  From the time we walked in to the time we left, our puppy was treated with so much love and compassion. We were admitted immediately and seen by a tech within a few minutes of being shown to our room. Right away, she discussed our options and the tests we could run to determine what the problem may be. Within the first 30 minutes of our admittance, we had him examined, seen by the vet, and started running tests to rule out the worst (parvo, worms, etc.).   Thankfully, he just had a bacterial infection and we were sent home with everything we needed to make sure he recovered appropriately.   The only issue we ran into was the long wait after he was diagnosed. We were there for about 3 1/2 hours. While checking out, we could see how busy they got while we were waiting, though, and understood that things happen. And, as with all emergency situations, pateints need to be prioritized (which is why the long wait doesn't affect our rating).  I was in hysterics on the way to the hospital, but left feeling calmer and more optimistic. The entire staff here at North Valley Regional Animal Hospital is amazing, from the front desk to the vets and techs. They even called us the next couple days to check on our puppy's progress.  I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area with a pet emergency! Your pet is in good hands here! : )

After a negative experience with our regular pediatrician, a family member recommended Cathy Kelley at Pediatrix for our 5-month-old daughter. We made the visit to this location purely to see Cathy.  We absolutely LOVE her. She is amazing with our daughter. She is patient and never makes us feel rushed. She always has answers to our questions and great advice (as first-time, young parents, we are always in need of good advice haha). Any time we need to get some at-home advice, Cathy has always returned our calls in a reasonable time frame, always on the same day.  We are not huge fans of the actual location, though, hence the 4 stars. While the medical professionals are always friendly and happy to see us, the office staff isn't as welcoming and upbeat as I would imagine a pediatrician's office should be. But maybe my expectations are just too high : )   We also aren't crazy about the set up of the lobby. When you first walk in, the "well children" section is to the left in its own little area, the front desk in the center, and the "sick children" section to the right, as well as the main entrance to the exam rooms. The "sick" section is open and exposed and basically the main area of the whole lobby. So we have to walkthrough the whole "sick" section in order to get into the back, which makes me feel uneasy. It's one thing to have a sick individual walk by, but its another to have to walk through a room full of cough germs in the air with my infant daughter. If there is a method to this set up, then I would definitely like to know.  Overall, though, we love how kid friendly the decor is, we love the medical staff, and we absolutely love Cathy. I would recommend this place to anyone with young children : )

I love this place!  My family comes here once a week, it's become our tradition.  The Pomegranate Raspberry is my absolute favorite.  I think more fruit variety would be nice, but it's not a big deal.  The location and deliciousness are more than enough! : )

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food, the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca. We have always encountered friendly, welcoming staff and amazing, fulfilling food. What more could you ask for?!

I totally LOVE this place. Every time we have been here, the employees have been incredibly nice, helpful, and knowledgable. Their selection is awesome, too, and they have reasonable prices. We mainly come here for dog bones and toys, and we have never been disappointed! I highly recommend this store for their selection and friendly staff : )

Our personal experience with this pediatricians office was bittersweet. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be a long review!  I gave birth to our daughter last year in September, and the pediatrician that saw her and checked up on us while we were in the hospital was absolutely amazing, She belonged to this practice, so we just followed her there to continue seeing her.  Unfortunately, this office was not nearly as amazing as our pediatrician. As with all newborn visits, we were going frequently for about five months. We made five visits total, and each visit was a below average experience. The ONLY reason we stuck it out as long as we did was for the pediatrician.  First, the look and feel. The lobby is small, outdated, and very uncomfortable. The majority of the chairs were the little kindergarten desk chairs, and they littered the open space in a messy and unorganized manner. We had to climb over a number of obstacles just to get to an open seat where we felt somewhat comfortable. From the T.V. to the mural on the wall, everything was so old looking. Even the magazines were outdated, by months. I always felt very uncomfortable and out of place, as if I was sitting in a home where I was unwelcome.  Second, the cleanliness. My goodness, this place was not up to par with my expectations of cleanliness for pediatricians. The lobby always had some sort of trash on the few side tables that were available. I could let that go if it weren't for the rooms. The one place I would expect thorough cleanliness is the examination rooms. Every time we waited in the room, I could not WAIT to get my daughter out of there! In our short time there, we saw leftover, half eaten candy, crumpled up paper towels, dried up spills, and even a stray diaper that somehow didn't make it into the trash bin. Gross!  Third, the office staff. On almost every visit, they were rude, unorganized, and quite honestly lazy. They oozed a "I have better things to do" attitude. They never kept the lobby clean, and the movies on the T.V. were almost always stuck on the title menu. They couldn't even pay attention to that! Their lack of attention to detail and their awful attitudes always had me leaving in a bad mood.  Fourth, the waiting. We waited for at least 45 minutes every time, despite being 10-15 minutes early. I understand falling behind in appointments, but waiting this long every single time and seeing patients who came in well after us getting called before we did was not cool. And even once we got in the room, we waited for AT LEAST another 30 minutes before finally seeing our doctor. Just waiting was exhausting in itself, especially with a newborn.  Finally, the straw that broke the camel's back. On my last visit, I literally waited for an hour and a half before finally getting into the back. The only reason I waited so long was because the office staff said my daughter was due for vaccinations, and I had already paid my co-pay. When I finally got a room (which had a lollipop stick stuck to the exam bed) I waited for another half hour before I finally grabbed someone from outside our room in the hallway and asked them how much longer our doctor would be. She had no idea. I told her we were just here for vaccinations. She checked our paperwork and told me that according to our chart, my daughter was not getting shots that day. That was it! I gathered my things, strapped my daughter back in her carseat, and just walked out of our room. As busy as the traffic in the hallway was, no one noticed. I kindly told the front desk that I had been waiting over two hours with no sight of my doctor and I was given a "that's too bad" half-ass apology. I never went back.  While our pediatrician was awesome, she alone did not make up for the awful experiences we had every single time we went in for my daughter's check ups. I originally started this review with two stars, think one star might be too harsh. But after re-living everything and writing it all down, I know that one star definitely describes our experience with this place.

I've anxiously been waiting for the opening of Desert Eagle Coffee (I live right down the street and pass it almost every day!) and I am pleased to say it was worth the wait! I had one of the ice blended drinks with mocha, my husband had a peach smoothie, and my daughter had a strawberry smoothie. All three were amazing. I usually find that most mocha flavored coffee drinks have either too much coffee or too much chocolate, but theirs had the perfect combination for my personal taste. The peach smoothie tasted like actual peaches, and the strawberry smoothie was sweet and refreshing. I love that this place is so close, because they've definitely made a loyal customer out of me!
