My husband & I have been going to Bravi for the past couple of years now & it is one of our favorites. The food is always amazing & the service is great. Their tomato soup is one of our favorite things to get. We have tried many of their pasta dishes & have loved all of them. We also love the fact that they're always quick & friendly!

My husband & I went here for dinner tonight & thought the food was amazing. We got the spring rolls & cream puffs as an appetizer then the orange chicken & sesame chicken for our main entrees. Everything tasted great and the staff was friendly. Will definitely go back.

Ordered online for delivery & got a confirmation saying "45 min to an hour." Well after an hour & 15 min we called to make sure they received the order & they said yes it's just coming out of the oven & will be on the way. No apology. I also think they should have called to say it would be late. You would think with such terrible reviews that they would try to work on stuff like that. Guess they're ok with a 2 star rating. Anyways, 30 minutes after calling still no pizza so I called again & was told the drivers car "broke down". Shouldn't they have called & told me that?? They said sorry & that I'd get a free pizza next time. Uh, how about you give me a refund! I didn't want our food spat in so I didn't say that. Anyways- 2 hours after we ordered they call & say the driver rang out doorbell. Then he gave about 3 other excuses so I asked for a refund & said never mind. This place is a joke. Do not give them your business.

I give the food at paradise bakery 5 stars- the service at this location, however, is horrible. They have gotten my order & coworkers orders wrong on multiple occasions. They are often cold & unfriendly. I have visited many other locations & have not had this problem. It's unfortunate that I often take my business elsewhere due to the staff.

This place is perfect. The layout, the cafe, the playground, everything. I wish there were more places like it! Moms & dad's are able to enjoy some coffee while their littles run around. It's also VERY clean. My son is 18 months old & had a great time. We will definitely be coming back!
