Honest, friendly and fair, My wife had a problem with her Escalade, 2 trips to cadaliac and one to GMC and no solution, Sunburst looked at the problem, said its a seal that goes bad on all escalades and it was fixed the same day, i will only go her

Michael jones at realty executives Arrowhead has without doubt the rudest, condescending bullying manner of any property manager I have ever come across. Rent your home from someone else this company does not care.  Here is a picture of the pool that is in the lease to be maintained, it went green through mis management mid July now it's mid September and the picture is from today.

The customer service client care and follow-up of this dentist is among the worst I have come across. Did you not follow up they do not keep parents informed they are rude and unhelpful.

I love sitting at the counter with my Kids looking at the food being cooked and watching them lost in amazement at all that is going on. Food is served fast, hot with great presentation, love the coke machine, seems to have 1000 combinations of flavors.

Great concept though poorly executed, service was slow and borderline indifferent, fries served were old and when asked for fresh the response was not so service like. OK for a quick visit though next time I'll go to Red Robin.

Many times a monopoly may be good for the consumer, in the case of cox it is like the fox minding the chickens, their customer service is a negative and corporate culture is bellow belief. Hate this company and wish there was an alternative.

We had the pleasure of having Dircks move us last week, Michelle set us up with a great quote, we had more stuff than i ever thought possible, the driver, Tony and his team were on time, Professional and courteous. The y arrived and immediately set out runners on the floor to protect our floors and got to work, the move went flawless from start to end. I would definitly recommend the team at Dircks for any and all of your moving needs.  #dircks, #Bestmoversinphoenix

If the manager on duty doesnt care about service why should the staff care, I walked out while 4 workers were chatting and nobody came to help so i left and went to staples, the difference is night and day,

Wow the have to get it together, I came in for a to go soup and it took 20 minutes now I'm back to pick up something I forgot and have been standing here for 10 minutes while managers and servers walk around. And yes there is a ration and charge for breadsticks, I thought these were bottomless.   Meh..... Make eye contact, acknowledge the customer and provide service.

We went here with our kids at 745pm and the girl working there could not have been more un helpful, rushed us, dissapeared, was totally unhelpful, if you post a closing time be open to that time.

We arrived at the restaurant, We waited at host desk for some one to come to us, a server came and said restaurant was full and we could sit at the high tops in the bar. Our server was, to say the least Disconnected, seemed not to care in either her actions or attitude, we waited to order, she didn't know the menu, said no to a simple substitution on one of our orders without even checking with the kitchen ( please substitute pasta for Mashed potatoes).  Food was ok, our chicken dish has greasy sauce on the plate and the chicken sandwich was dry.  The bartender came by to help with drinks and was very personable, possibly the only redeeming feature

I have been a member here for the last number of months, it started out very very strong caring conscientious people that works there and over the last number of visits the service has got worse and worse and worse uncaring unhelpful almost shouting at you canceling my service today due to these issues the great concept the can be ruined by having the wrong frontline employees.

My rating is because I cannot give Zero.  Never never use this company, they are everything you hear about Bad Moving Companies. My experience is this is the best example of bait and switch in moving. Should you choose them, get everything in writing prior to them starting work, Trust nothing they say, watch the workers, supervisor slowed down the crew all day and so much more.

What a difference a change of leadership can do for a company.  I received a call from Ron, the new general manager who listened to my concerns and took the time to meet with me, he was understanding and very courteous and took responsibility for what had happened and made amends, it is my opinion that they have made the changes for the better and with Ron at the helm i would be happy to give them another opportunity.
