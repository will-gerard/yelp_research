WOOOOO! I love this place! I'm a huge fan of the arts and I'm so happy that there's a theatre as great as this close to home!   I was there last week to see bird cage (la cage follies)! It was a fantastic performance an I was trilled to come watch another show at this theatre. The actually theatre is pretty small. So small in fact that the orchestra is actually placed in a separate room on location and microphones transfer the live music out to the main stage. If you are sitting in the audience and look up you can see the director and lighting experts working their magic. The sound engineers are located in the back of the theatre which is the usual spot in most theaters. The seats were kind of uncomfortable but there was a person in the lobby trying to get donations for new chairs so I can't really say much about that.  During intermission I did have a slight problem with the pace the concessions were being sold. I tried to be patient because I knew they were having an issue with the credit card machine and the girl working was very apologetic but I felt like I was about to be trampled from behind by starving guests... But damn that cookie was good.   I'm excited for this seasons performances! Especially RENT!!

I'm a huge fan of Sunwest!   This location is definately the most convenient to get to besides the cactus branch. The staff at this location is very friendly and always willing to help you out. If you need a loan ask if you qualify... They will be more than willing to sit you down and talk over some options you may qualify for.   I'm happy Sunwest locations are open Saturdays now! I can see how that's awesome for those who work a five to nine job. Now if they ALL had drive through windows! (Super convenient!)   If you wanna drop your lousy bank and move your finances to a place you can trust any Sunwest branch will do!

I love Duck & Decanter! I've been coming here for years! This is an awesome little spot to brings your friends for lunch! Not only do they have a great menu, but the environment and vibe is also awesome. This hidden gem reminds me of a log cabin that just happens to be a restaurant. They have a little gift shop in the restaurant and they always have the coolest kitchen gadgets and nic-nac gifts.    My favorite sandwich is the Genoa. This masterpiece.... Genoa salami, herb and garlic cream cheese, marinated tomatoes, spinach on a French roll.  I've a had almost all the sandwiches.... Some other note worthy options are....  - "the duckling" - smoked turkey and duck breast with a cranberry relish,  watercress on a raisin bread.  -"briesciutto" - sun dried tomato spread, prosciutto, Brie cheese, and your choice of bread. I also like to add spinach.  -albacore tuna is also awesome!   There are several more options that are fantastic but too many to name. Come check this place out and sit upstairs to see some local art or come on in when they have live music (Fridays I think). This is a great place to take out of towners.

This review is for the Pharmacy.   The staff here is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I've been coming to this location for years now and have never had a bad experience! The pharmacists are all very friendly and have wonderful attitudes! They are sure to take their time to make sure you understand everything about the medication you are about to be taking and are awesome about answering all your questions.    The waiting area could use a make-over and I only say this because I've been to several other locations of CVS and they are all new a updated! This one needs a face-lift for sure!   I'm shocked by all the negative reviews.  I believe the worst part of this location is the homeless people hanging out front, but besides that the service has always been fantastic!

I've been coming to Elle Nails for some time now. This salon has a variety of services including but not limited to waxing and nails. I usually go with the mani/pedi bundle and usually pay around 35$. The ladies here take their time and make sure you are comfortable. They have the typical up-charges like sea salt scrub, callus removal etc... The basic spa pedicure is 20$ this includes an awesome  foot massage and your typical spa pedicure. I usually ask who's ever working on my toes to go a little harder on my foot/leg massage and they have no problem doing so. You can also get a back massage while getting a manicure. They have the massage chairs for the pedicure stations so you don't have to worry about that.   The ladies that work here are always super friendly and make conversation when I'm visiting.   I'm a fan of this place I will continue to keep coming back!

QT is my go to gas station! They usually have the cheapest gas prices around me and great customer service!  They also always have very clean/organized facilities and great selections on food and to-go products you may need on a road trip.  The only thing that could make QT better is if they could somehow get on the red box band-wagon if they did I don't think I would get gas anywhere else!

Great local thrift shop. I've been donating to this location for several years now and shop here every once in a while when I am looking for something specific. The location could be a little more organized on the inside but its not too bad. The staff is very friendly ad helpful.   Stop by if your a "thrift-er" I'm sure you will find something cool! They have a pretty decent jewelry section which I was surprised to see my first time in.

I found books for 1$-2.50$.. And good books!!   The staff is also really friendly and helpful! I had one of the girls suggest a few books and so far I've loved every single one!   Side note you can bring your old books in here and get $$ or trade for new ones!

I'm a reader so I love Barnes and Noble! I love that I can just come here relax at the coffee shop get some work done in a clean safe and fun environment.   They have a great selection of every type of book you can imagine. I find it fun to people watch in the different sections.  Now with kindles and Ipads I feel people don't come to book stores as often... its sad.... to me I still like that smell and the sound of that new book when you first open it.   The staff here is very friendly and helpful!

I was invited to my cousins wedding at this lovely location. The resort itself is absolutely stunning!! The grounds are very well kept and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The wedding was held on the golf course and made for an amazing view of the mountains and sunset (which was perfect for this 530 wedding). The area where the reception took place was right below the main restaurant/bar for the resort. the area provided was small but perfect for the amount of people attending (they may have a separate location for bigger parties) there was plenty of room on the dance floor for us to all get-down and boogie!   The resort also catered the food and I must say I was very impressed. AS the guests of the party entered the reception area we were greeted with smiles by two young ladies serving finger foods as appetizers. There was a try of baby bruschetta, and crape wrapped asparagus sprinkled with asiago cheese. Both were very good but I must say to the restaurant manager... if this asparagus isn't on your normal menu it should be and ASAP! They were Delicious and everyone really enjoyed them!! For dinner we had the option of a steak which came with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus or salmon that came with a side of rice pilaf and asparagus. I was lucky enough to try both options and personally i would always pick salmon of steak but this time around I enjoyed the steak much more! My steak was cooked just perfectly but i did hear other guests say there's was a little rare for their liking (I didn't mind it at all).   although I didn't have took much connection with much of the staff the ones that were working this party we all extremely nice and helpful!   all in all i would defiantly recommend this location to throw and large corporate event or wedding. I'm sure you will be taken care of!

I came into this place yesterday for lunch. G and I shared the pesto chicken panini and the turkey cranberry sandwich both came with a bag of chips. We also shared the boysenberry smoothie.   The pesto Chicken panini was my favorite! It was awesome possum! Totally hit the spot with all the fresh ingredients.   The turkey cranberry was also very good! Again super fresh ingredients and delicious fresh multigrain bread.  The smoothie was seriously on a different level! It was no joke one of the best smoothies I have ever had! Beats Jamba Juice any day hands down!  Have various sandwiches (both hot and cold), salads, wraps and even a kids menu. This place also has tons of smoothies and fresh made to order juices to choose from! I will 100% be back to try more. I have a feeling this will be my new go to!

This Albertsons-osco has been here forever! The staff here is super friendly and very informative if u have questions about products they may or may not carry. This location is usually pretty well organized and clean... The restrooms could use in upgrade and a good deep clean but besides that this Albertsons isn't bad.   They have a great selection of liquor and wine and even have an option to mix match six packs of specialty beer. Always a good option for those beer drinkers out there. They also give a discount (10% off) of six bottles of wine or more. Not too shabby.   Great selections of meats and they often have deals like buy one get TWO FREE, or some deal that you just can't beat! Also check the front of the store and random isles for the deals of the week and such.   All is all great customer service, fresh produce and clean location that often has tons of deals! Keep up the good work Albertsons PV crew!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this locally family owned business! If you are a smart pool owner you will without a doubt choose this place for all your pool needs from now on!   This place is amazing! They have everything you need to care for your pool, not only do they have a great selection of products with amazing rates but the customer service is like none-other. They go above and beyond to help you out and answer all your questions.   The location is a little difficult to find but its in your best interest to find this little gem!  This is a perfect example of why you should always support small business such as this awesome shop!!!

Came to join my mother on her lunch break at this little spot.   It's a decently small restaurant but not too small. The sushi bar is full of interesting fish and colorful veggies. The lunch specials here are great and you have a few different options to choose from. We split a tootsie roll, spicy tuna, and a crazy roll. All were very good but I'm a huge fan of spicy tuna and I wasn't let down! The fish in all of our rolls was very fresh and delicious. The salmon nigiri was fantastic and I always add a sheso mint leaf and squeeze a lemon wedge over the top and wowzers it's amazing give it a try! The albacore shasimi was also great!   The prices here are very reasonable although I wish the rolls would have been a little bit larger. I was also pleased to see that they served Saki and not only do they have saki but they have my favorite unfiltered saki!!!  The young lady that was working here was very friendly and the sushi chef was also nice! The service was fast and my overall experience was great! I'll defiantly becoming back. I forgot to ask while I was there but I'm interested if they actually have fresh wasabi or if its just their name.

Lets take a moment to talk about the non professors and teachers...Seriously the worst customer service I've ever received. No one is on the same page. Financial aid, advisors, office staff are ALL unhelpful, and rude. I've honestly never had such an awful experience trying to give people money to further my education. Calling to get an issue figured out? Forget about it. You will be on wait for 30 min up to 3 hours, get disconnected multiple times then be told to contact a different office or just never get through to the person your actually trying to reach. I had people tell me that they would resolve my problems and never follow through. Even supervisors were unhelpful! Do yourself a favor and find a different school that has there stuff together.   Professors and teachers.... Here it gets better.   I've been taking classes here for sometime now. I actually already have an associates in Liberal Arts from here and I'm in the process of getting another in sign language. After this semester I will be applying for their interpreting preparation program which is ranked in the top three programs in the state for the last time I checked.   Joanne has been my advisor for two years now is the absolute best. She has been there for me every step of the way and advised me in the right direction in every which way!   The campus is usually always clean and the grounds are kept up daily. I still prefer Scottsdale community Colleges campus over PC but its not bad. I like that if your in a specific program majority of our classes are held in the same building so you don't have to be running from one side of campus to another. This campus is also in the process of remodeling and adding new buildings as well s parking structures. I'm looking forward to the new look!   The staff here has been great I have yet to take a class and not like the professor. I highly recommend, Jeff Stone, Tamara Henner, David Bailey and Michelle Monhan for any American Sign Language or Interpreting classes. For English I highly recommend Cristie Roe. All these professors go above and beyond to help their students and really take the time to make sure everyone understands the material that they are teaching.

I was craving a sandwich. And I always pass this place and have never been in... I'm very happy I stopped! As I was getting out of my car there was a lady walking out who put on the "closed" sign. :( my luck it was 3:58pm and they close at 4pm. I was bummed! As I was about to walk away feeling defeated by the sandwich gods this nice man came out and said "Hey I can make you a sandwich to go really fast" I was hesitant because I know what a pain in the butt it is when someone strolls in right as you about to close up shop, but he assured me that everything still needed to be put away so it wouldn't be a problem. I ordered the Sacks Symphony which seemed to be the easiest thing to make just to be sure I wasn't being too big of a jerk. The cook made it up in a jiffy I cashed out with the sandwich and a bag of chip for about 8$ and I was on my way.  The sandwich was HUGE! As least for me it was. The sandwich had delicious crispy bacon, fresh avocado, sprouts and tomatoes along with cream cheese and savory turkey.  It was delicious and SOOO FRESH!   My favorite part was the awesome cookie that comes with every meal! Sold!  Ill be back soon! Very soon! Great service and awesome food!

Nati's alterations is awesome. I'm sooooo happy they are still in the area. I've been coming to this place for years! I remember when Nati took in a full sequence size 13 dress in for me and made it into a size 0 for me! It was perfect and I've been coming here ever since! Now Nati's is under new management but still the same quality of work!   The prices are extremely reasonable so I always take my jeans and clothes here!   Lets keep this awesome local business around! They do awesome work for cheap and they work around the clock to keep the turn around time fast! You can sometimes drop something off and depending on the work you can probably get it back in the same week if she's not too slammed!   Love Nati's they will always have my business!

I've been coming to this little spot for years now!! Its fantastic!! The secret is Taco Thursday! My family and I often make our way in on Thursdays for there taco special!  Dollar tacos and dollar house margaritas!! I mean how can you beat that?! For this special you get to choose between 3 taco options... Carne asada (my favorite) Beef Taco (only one that comes on a crispy shell) and the Fish taco (Yummmm). The margaritas are small but powerful! if you want something on the healthier side go for the fish taco with no tortilla its still awesome because the fish is always fresh!   The nice cute as a button ladies (all of them are wonderful) greet you with a smile and as soon as you sit down they bring over some chips and salsa but my favorite part is the AMAZING bean dip! ooooooh soooo good I could drink it! The cheese crisps are also to die for they come with green chilies (not spicy) so they give it a little something extra (sooo delish).  Another must try is there Tortilla Soup! Its hearty and full of think chunks of veggies including avocado! Great for someone who's not feeling so great (a touch of nani's cooking does the body good!!)    Cecilia is they most amazing server ever and I'm pretty sure my family would adopt her (basically has) if they could! She is seriously amazing its come to the point where we don't even have to tell her want we want to eat because she knows our order like the back of her hand! Shes always aware of whats going on in the entire restaurant and is always on her A-game!!!  We love our Cici!

This review is for Karl's Bakery and The Bakers Daughter. I've been coming to Karl's since I was allowed to walk down the street by myself as a kid. Then some years passed and I remember walking to Karl's every morning before in high school and getting a maple long john!!! These are by far my favorite treat here... but If you want one you better be there early because they seem to sell out because they are pretty popular!  Honestly the best bakery in town! They have everything from Chocolate covered strawberries to croissants! Fresh cookies and treats made daily too! a box of Karl's goodies always makes for a great treat to bring to a party or if you're just in a good mood you could bring some donuts too your co-workers ( they will love you forever)  I love that this bakery is family owned and operated! They staff (family) is always in a good mood! Having a party and need a special order? come to Karl's to get cookies, cake and other yummy treats that your guest will love! I recently was throwing a party to celebrate my mothers fifth year of being cancer free and I was going crazy with the treat and special details. I went in to The Bakers Daughters Chocolate shop (connected to the bakery) to talk to Cristine about doing a special order of truffles for me. She wasn't there so I left my name, number and Idea with the sweet girl who was working at the time. Not even and hour later Christine called me back to discus the details. She was amazing and had no problem answering all my questions and totally went above and beyond to make me exactly what I was looking for while still working within my budget! I'm so excited to see the final product but I'm sure the little ovarian cancer ribbon chocolates will be perfect!! I wouldn't expect anything less from this amazing place.   Defiantly check out the new addition to Karl's which is called The Bakers Daughter! Everything is soooo amazing and she specializes in truffles! so many varieties my favorite is the roasted raspberry and the lavender! The truffles are a little pricey but defiantly worth it!!! They are priced in weight and are about 11$ for a 100 grams ** which comes out to around 99 cents for the normal truffles and about 1.20$ for the gourmet ones!!!   Once you have been to Karl's I swear you will be hooked!!

Everything you need to improve your home under one roof! This is also a great place to by gifts for those men in your life.   Being a women and walking in-to a store like this can be a little over whelming, but the staff that works here makes sure to answer all your question and makes you feel like you can accomplish anything!   I love home depot and their helpful staff- A+

Love ZIA records! This is an awesome place to trade and buy DVDS and Music. I found series of TV shows that I could find anywhere else. Often times they will have new and used versions of majority of what they carry just in case you would like a new unused dvds or cds/records. They also have a large selection of gag-gifts and nic-nacs for your entertainment. The customer service is always very good and the staff is usually always willing to help you find what you are looking for. The trick with any ZIA records is to call and ask the representative on the other line to look up whatever it is you maybe looking for. If that location doesn't have what you are looking for you can almost always find it at a different location.   Awesome go-to to find TV series- Movies- DVDs and Music!!!

I've been coming to this place since I was a little girl. You can't beat the lunch specials here!! The only thing they are missing is a patio and happy hour!   Try the lasagna and the manicotti! This lasagna is seriously one of the best I've ever had!!! I don't know what it is about the simple garden salad here but it's amazing!! I also love the antipasti salad!! The garlic parmesan bread that they give out with the meals is mouthwatering and worth going in just for that alone!  The menu is pretty large so you have several options to feed your craving. The portions are great for sharing but also great for one person who's decently hungry.   The building has a small bar that can seat about 7 but the dining area is split in two which is great if you want to have a large party. They have both booths and tables which are both very comfortable. You can always count on seeing off duty officers or local firefighters enjoying a meal here (always makes me feel safe).  The staff here is always friendly and I always have a enjoyable visit.

Let me begin by saying that I've lived in AZ most of my life and I've been to hundreds (no joke) of nails technicians... I am very picky when it comes to my nails.  I live close by and walked over to Sachi the other day to see if they could squeeze me if for a quick gel-manicure. In my amazement they had an opening. The nice woman at the counter showed me down stairs to a little room. This is were I met Dante.   Right off the bat she was super sweet and hilarious! I picked out my color and she quickly begin removing my old polish. Now let me cut to the chase. I have never in my experience had someone clean my nails as well as she did. It was like they were never really cleaned before. She took her time and was very precise with detail throughout the entire process. We shared stories with each other and I swear It felt like I had known this sweet woman for years!   I left Sachi with the BEST gel-manicure ever!   Dante did a fabulous job and I will with out a doubt be back in to see her! Seriously ladies if you want an awesome, traditional (no nail art) manicure, you can't find better than Dante!!   Side note: I'm getting married soon and I now know who I'll be going to see before my special day, to make sure that my nails are on point!

This review is for the Take Care clinic in the Walgreens.   This weekend I had a run in with a rusty nail and it won. Needless to say I wasn't sure when my last tetanus shot was but I knew it had been about ten years since my last one so I hobbled into the Take Care clinic.   I was lucky enough to have no wait when I arrived. I checked in on the electronic screen, sat down in the clean tidy waiting area and  was called less than a minute later. The nice assistant showed me to large doctors room where I filled out a short form and questionnaire. The doctor Heather was SOO nice! She answered all my questions and was extremely knowledgable! She made me feel better by easing my mind almost instantly. I received my shot and was out of there in 15-20 min! Heather was awesome and I would defiantly be back to see her!   Oh and if you have insurance majority of all immunization are covered! The services at Take Care clinics are also cheaper than seeing a doctor in a private practice for ur everyday sicknesses. Check them out!   Heather keep up the awesome work! You were great!

Dunkin Donuts uses 100-percent Arabica coffee beans!   Plenty of options to choose from! Espresso, Coffee, Lattes, and Cappuccinos and a ton of different flavored syrups to add into any drink! They also have decent breakfast food to satisfy your craving if you're in a rush. Try the Big and Toasted. Yummmmmm but so not heathy. The breakfast sandwiches are basically all the same... egg, meat, cheese and the bread ranges from Texas toast, and bagels to glazed doughnuts.  Yeah....I don't think I'll every be trying that one anytime soon. The best part about DD are the super reasonable prices and great service! The new location near the Biltmore area is by far my favorite and has the best service by far!  All the people working here always have a smile on their face and make my visit a great one!

Yes I am a fan! My favorite is the Mango-A-Go-Go with the immunity boost! I get it every time!!  The staff here is always friendly and the juice is well.... delightful! If you don't like yours they are usually always willing to remake it for you!  Try a shot a wheat grass it will rid your body of toxins and give you that healthy boost you need!   I'm doing the Jamba dance now... Oh and look on groupon they sometimes have a 5$ for $10 deal which you can't beat!!

I love Einstein's! This location isn't my favorite but I'm biased toward loving the location I used to go to as a child. The staff at this Scottsdale location is very nice and helpful, at times I notice they get flustered (usually during the peak hours) and sometimes forgetful. But all in all they are super friendly so I guess in some cases it makes up for their rare mistakes they make. Just be sure to check your order if you come here during a rush.   The location itself is easy to find but this parking lot is a disaster and always is, so be warned about the parking situation (park to the left of the building for a non crowded lot)    My usual is an everything bagel toasted with plain cream cheese. Possibly double toasted if I'm in a picky mood.   They also have awesome breakfast and lunch sandwiches and an awesome coffee selection. "Darn good coffee!"   I'll be back for the delicious fresh bagels that are made daily the friendly staff and dirty chi latte! Yum!

Baby Costco! I really like Smart and final. Surprising deals on foods you love!    This location isn't my favorite but it's not bad! It's well lit, fairly well organized and the staff (some of them) are super nice and the prices are really reasonable!    Smart and Final is exactly what I said before it's a baby costco. You get large amounts of food, kitchen supplies etc. at a discounted bulk price... You can't go wrong!

On the Rocks is one of Scottsdales hidden gems! This place has AMAZING deals on beer and the perfect place to get a group of friends together and play some games!  They have shuffle board, darts, pool, bar-side arcade games and a jukebox! Another awesome side note is that you can bring in your own food!   The customer service here is also great!  If you are looking for a great time at a hole in that wall bar with great deals and a friendly staff, you would be crazy not to check this place out!!  LOVE ON THE ROCKS!!

The lunch specials aren't so bad.... But the food is your typical fast food Chinese place. Greasy, saucy, mediocre.   Try the sesame chicken. The pepper steak is really overly sauced up but not too bad. The fried wontons are yummy but the egg rolls are super bland.   This place is good for hangover food or a good place to stop if you want really unhealthy Chinese to hit the spot.... I've had this feeling one too many times. Order on line and pick it up or they also deliver.   Ummm side note... What's up with the HUGE goldfish looking thing in the fish tank? It's seriously too big to even swim in a tank that small. It literally can't move. I know it's just a fish but I feel like this is animal abuse.

Great customer service and very reasonable prices!!! I got two new tires for 140$. The men working are all super knowledgeable and friendly!  Side note. Call before you come to check on wait times!   They also have tons of coupons out there!

I'm in loveeeeeee. In love so much I have a problem. No but really I think this place has re-flamed my shopping addiction.   250$ shoes for 18$ yes please!! Seriously I've found Jimmy choos for 18$. 1000$ handbags for $100 granted you must have any eye! All the items that are in this store started at nordstroms then went to nordstroms rack then found themselves on the messy racks here. Majority of the items are missing buttons, have broken zippers, large stains or clearly worn then returned. The key here is too look very closely at what you are about to buy because not everything is in bad shape.   The rules posted on the wall are there for your protection... Yes I'm not joking. Crazy women in need of a good bargain can be extremely scary! I've had jeans ripped off my shoulder, shoes taken out of my cart and I've even seen women screaming at one another over a dress. (It was a fabulous dress but lets get real it's a dress!) this place is SOO insane at times I've seen women been asked to leave the store an not return because they've broken the rules of the last chance gods. I'm making this place sound insane... Well it really is but for fashionistas like myself it's sooooo good it hurts.. I wasn't kidding when I said I have problem.. But the first key to success is knowing you have a problem right?.... Oooooh look at that amazing Chole handbag over there!!    The trick to this place is make friends with someone who works here and have them sneak you the details on when they get their shipments. Yeah yeah I know that's cheating but come on I need more shoes... And more clothes... And we'll I could also use a new handbag... And sunglasses.   Don't be surprised if you go before they open and find a crowd outside waiting for the doors to open. Also don't be confused when they ask you to clear away from a section in the store so they can block it off and restock... "Please do not run or push each other when we take down the ropes... if you do so you will be asked to leave" yeah I've been here so many times I've heard this one too many times.   Be prepared to bargain shop... If you're not a patient shopper don't even try to bother messing with us über extreme bargain hunters.   ALL SALES ARE FINAL!!!! So like I said before check your items before you buy them!

I always passed by this place but last week I met up my aunt for lunch. This place has a great atmosphere and very friendly fast service! I had the rosemary chicken sandwich... It's was AMAZING! Perfect mixture of savory and sweet! Ill be craving this sandwich within a week I'm sure. The sandwiches come with a small simple side salad with a sweet (but not too sweet) vinaigrette. Ou can also choose to upgrade to French fries which I would usually do but I was in a healthy mood. The little side salad was the prefect addition to my sandwich which was a perfect amount! My aunt ordered the FEZ salad and added chicken. I stole a bite and it was also soooo good! I feel like this is a place where I could come back and try everything on the menu.   Our server was extremely helpful and friendly... I give them an "A" for service!  Ill be back soon to try something new!

I am addicted. The Chicken Pine-nut Gorgonzola salad is the bees knees I could seriously eat it everyday!!! Also try the Chicken Caesar Pizza ( its a pizza with a salad on top). The staff here is great and very helpful! Remember to leave a tip because I have known people who have worked here and they make less than minimum wage! SO TIP! The Mac and cheese here is also amazing but be careful once you start you cant stop! Thank you Sam Fox. I love Sauce and FYI if you ever open up a location in Santa Monica (would be an amazing location for a new store) I will be there to help you! :)

Chicken pine nut Gorgonzola salad is where it's at!!! Thats my go to. The macaroni and cheese is also really good. Well shoot they have a ton of things I enjoy!  The chicken Ceaser pizza (a pizza with a salad on top) is a healthier option and still delicious. You can actually add any salad on top of a of the crust.   The apple walnut and spinach salad is pretty tasty, as well as the tomato soup!  The paninis are all pretty great and come with a side of chips. They just added some brushetta to the menu that make great starters, and the cheesecake is an awesome dessert!   Ask for an extra roll... Oh man their bread rolls are some of the best I've ever tasted. Believe me you will want another.   This location has awesome service just wish there was a patio :)

Recently my uncle rented out a theatre at this location to celebrate my aunts 55th birthday! This would be this first time I've been to this theatre since they changed it into the dine-in movies. Lets just say I was very impressed! A few family members showed up early to set things up but when we arrived the staff was already on top of it! We requested to play a short video as soon as all the guests arrived and the staff had no problem accommodating that request. As the guests arrived the friendly staff walked around taking drink orders and quickly returned with the beverages and continued to take orders and help out with anything we requested. After a few minuets of greeting each other we sat down in our huge comfy recliners and started our private viewing of Iron man 3. During the beginning of the film the wait staff walked around taking food orders from the guests, we were given a fixed menu to choose our meals from. We had the option on a chicken quesadilla or loaded potato skins to choose from for an appetizer, and for the main course we could choose from four different burgers or a chicken Ceaser wrap (all options came with a choice or house made potato chips or french fries). I ordered the potato skins as my appetizer and the bacon cheese burger with french fries as my main meal. The potato skins were very good... not amazing but defiantly better that what I expected. Burger and fries were average.   The bar is pretty expensive... 40+ $ for a bottle of wine? 10+$ for a glass? That's okay if I'm fine dinning but get real... The wine selection wasn't even that great.   All in all the service was fantastic and the food was better than expected (but not wonderful)... Ill be back.

Love this park! I remember having Birthday parties here as a child and having the best time!   Clean HUGE and kid friendly park. keep the kids entertained with rides, playgrounds, bike paths lakes with ducks and other animals running around and plenty of shaded ramada areas to relax or grill up some grub for your afternoon picnic or birthday celebration.   Surrounded by an great neighborhood full of historic homes, local businesses and super close to Phoenix College.   Ill be back.

I came in today to trade some woman's apparel. When I arrived I carried my four bags and one box to the back of the store where the trade counter is. A young brunette girl asked me if I had ever traded here before and I told her no. She pointed to a clip board and said to read over the trade agreement. I was told it would be about 30min. As I browsed around the decently organized store and looked through the racks I noticed that majority of the merchandise was extremely out dated. I thought to myself well geeez they will have to take my "in style" higher end clothing. After looking around for about five min I sat down in a chair located right next to the trade counter. I watched the same girl talk to her co-worker for about ten minuets about total nonsense then she proceeded to go through her phone. I sat there staring at my untouched bags in front of her thinking about how many other things I could be doing. Shortly after this she dumped all my bags out on a long table without unfolding items she literally took handfuls of unfolded clothing and placed it back into the bags without even looking at it. I'm feeling annoyed at this point... But it gets better. As I'm still sitting waiting for her I look up to see she has disappeared, but all my clothes are still scattered all over the table. (Side note it's been over 45 min by this point) I wait... And wait.. After about 10min she returns to continue gossiping about other coworkers. Once again she is taking handfuls of clothes balling them up and stuffing them back into my bags without looking at them. As I'm literally rolling my eyes I look over to see her picture on the wall... Low and behold she's a "shift leader". You have got to be kidding me. She continues to shove my clothes in bags and walks away AGAIN! I wait for another 5 min to finally be called. When I reached the counter a nice middle aged women explained that they would be taking 15 items and that the trade amount would be "$15.75 store credit or cash would be $3.50." I had clothes that still had never been worn and your taking 15 items and you want to give me $3.50? Get real! I'd rather donate them. I told her no thank you and took all my clothing back.   All in all my experience was not a good one. I won't be back and I highly recommend staying away from this place.

I'll keep this short and straight to the point. I'm so dissapointed. I came in with a group of friends during the weekend. I asked for a basic mani-pedi. Payed 40$. The lady I had wasn't the most pleasent. While finishing my to  coat she accidentally bumped a nail and instead of taking the polish off that finger and redoing it, she just put another topcoat over trying to cover it up. It was a glob of clear uneven nail polish on one finger... Clearly this isn't going to end well. I sat and let them all dry for over thirty min. As soon as I got in my car that nail was ruined, so I went back inside and had them fix it while they talked about me in Korean.   All in all it was not worth it. My mani (even after they fixed the bad nail) only lasted one full day. My pedicure didn't even last a week. For a pedicure not to last at least a week is absurd in my opinion.   I won't be back.

I'm a huge fan of Tuesday Morning. This is a great place to come to find last minuet gifts and cool affordable home goods!  I've rushed in several times to grab a quick present for a baby shower or toy for a toddlers birthday they usually have a good selection of stuffed animals, and games for youngsters. Looking for a gift for your mother or father you can also count on finding something here. They have a whole section of candles, frames even clothing that your mothers would love and for your tech loving brother or father they are sure to have some cool gadgets that can make them smile. If you like to scrapbook and you haven't been in yet you need to get here ASAP they have everything ranging from a work desk to stickers, fun paper, crazy scissors and fun colored calligraphy pens! (I wish I had more time to scrapbook)    The prices here are very affordable and be sure to look for the yellow stickers noting their sale items (they also have a little section for sale stuff)  The staff is okay there's a few employees who are over the top nice and then you have those who don't even greet you when you walk in.  Check out Tuesday morning!! I'm sure you will find something for everyone in the family... and don't forget to buy yourself two gifts... you deserve it :)

Dirty. This location is just plain grimy. The floors are filthy the bathrooms are horrendous and the theaters smell. Thankfully the staff is decent. I'd steer clear of this location if you can help it... This is Arcadia I expected more.   I feel like this would be a great location if they updated the theaters and work on the sanitary conditions. Dine in movies maybe?

So I absolutely LOVE F&E! I was beyond ecstatic to move from AZ to Cali and have a location down the street from me. With news of this fabulous chain closing all stores in the US I was devastated. But thank my lucky stars they were recently bought out and are staying in the US. I have yet to be to any location of F&E and have a bad experience. They have the most amazing customer service, I swear its a requirement of all locations to have a top-notch crew working in their stores! I can go on and on about how awesome the customer service is but the best part of this amazing market is the awesome deals. They always the the freshest produce and the lowest prices in town! You can beat the 98 cent produce section. Yes you heard right they have packages of fruit, veggies and other awesome select foods for only 98cents!! Another reason I love F&E is the clearance section! When food throughout the store is getting close to the sell date on the packages the F&E staff reduces the price to almost more than half if not 70-80% off some products. This is the place to go if you are planning on having a large BBQ or small family dinner. I have found steaks for only 5$ and they were HUGE! They also have awesome deals on beer and wine (often have a buy one get one for 1cent on wine). This is my favorite market hands down! You cant beat the awesome deals and customer service!! Oh and they also give back to the community so this is another reason I choose the Amazing Fresh and Easy!   Just  little side note.... If this review is ever seen by the owners of Fresh and Easy  I have one piece of advice for you... REDBOX REDBOX REDBOX! if you guys were able to get a contract with red box you would be a golden child!!! I swear that you would up your sales greatly because your customers would have everything they need all in one place, they only time I don't come to your store and choose a different market is because I want to grab a quick movie at redbox; therefore I take my business elsewhere where I can get all I need at one location (which send pains down my spine because I love giving you my business) I know many of your loyal customers agree with me on this. :)     Love you fresh and easy! Keep up the awesome work!

Yum yum yum..... I wanna rub chick fil a's chicken all over my face! It's soooooooooo good!   Get a number five. 12 piece... The 8 will not be enough. Yum. Honey as ur dipping sauce is amazing! The waffle fries are delightfully delicious.   The lemonade is the best you have ever had! I'm scared that this location is so close to my house.   This location is clean and the staff is very friendly!

I love TJ-MAXX this location is actually one of the better ones but the Paradise Valley location is still my favorite!  This is a great place to come for a last minuet affordable outfit. You can get everything for your night out. A dress, heels, jewelry, handbag even new shampoo to get your hair looking fresh and clean!  I do love the fact they have a beauty section here, its nice to know I can find those expensive products I never buy for myself here at a reasonable price. Its right next to the jewelry section though so have some self control! When it comes to the fashion here its a little harder to have as much control because they always have the latest styles in fashion and they make sure to keep it clean and tidy so you can actually enjoy your shopping experience.   This is also an awesome place to come to find house warming gifts for those friends you love, or just to spice up your own living space! I swear my last house was fully decorated thanks to TJ-MAXX!   Majority of the time the staff  at all locations are very friendly and helpful, I've only ever had one experience with an older lady working at the dressing room that had a very unpleasant disposition... I haven't seen her again and I hope I never do.    All in all keep it up TJ-MAXX!

Great location. A little smaller than most but its the perfect location for me.   Very clean, well organized store with an extremely friendly staff just like most  Trader Joes. Any time I have question about a product or need a suggestion (even if its a recipe suggestion.) The staff is always extremely helpful and seem to have a "this is the best day ever!" Attitude... Everyday.  The only downfall of this location is the parking situation... ALWAYS hectic.  All in all great location.

I've been here multiple times to have shoes repaired. I went very recently to have a pair of boots metal shoelace loops replaced. When I dropped them off I was told it would be about an hour. After running some errands I went back to pick them up. As I was looking over them I realized there was a little tear in the leather that wasn't there before. Asked the nice man that was working if there was any way he could put something on the leather so it would tear any further. He had no problem doing this. After two min he returned and my shoes were like brand new. He felt bad about the little tear in the leather and ended up not charging me at all. I really appreciate that he didn't try to pull a  fast one on me and try to charge me more. I come here all the time and ill continue to come back for the great service.  This location is a little tricky to find.

Oh Royal Palm park.... I remember when this park had the coolest tallest slide when I was a kiddo!! someone broke both their arms falling off so they took it out. (Totally understandable) the park is huge and surrounding they have little workouts you can do on uneven bars and random little workout areas. The playground was just recently redone about 4 years ago and is still looking pretty good!  This is a great location to have sports teams come practice (field sports) although I am bummed they took the volleyball courts out. They defiantly need some sand courts ASAP. I agree with a pervious yelper that its kinda crazy they don't have a restroom... Honestly I didn't really notice until I read that review because I live pretty close so it's never been a problem but i can totally see her point if you have young children.  A few years ago this park was a little sketchy when it came to homeless hanging out, but now they have police that come by pretty often to make sure there's noting fishy going on. Now I feel much more comfortable going for a run alone.   This park is perfect to play frisbee golf ("frolf") or have an outrageous water balloon fight! It's also a great place to take your well-trained dog to play some catch... And don't worry if they make a doodie the park as a poop-bag dispenser.    Oh writing this review makes me have flashbacks of the grapefruit wars Sunnyslope would have vs Washington years ago....

This is my go to place for car care! These guys are always super helpful and honest (which can be very hard to find) They have great affordable rates and the customer service is great! This location is perfect because you can drop y our car off and walk next door to grab a quick bite while they work their magic!  No complaints here! Keep up the great work!

Sunwest has been my bank of choice for the last 15 years! I was so happy for this new location to open and I'm even more pleased with the new renovations made to the building.  The staff here is by far one of the most genuine, kind groups of people I have ever come across in a business. I have yet to visit this location and have a bad experience. The tellers are always smiling and greet me with a friendly hello (which we all know on certain days can be the highlight of our day) The Branch manager here Loree is an all-star! She used to be at the main location (Black Canyon Freeway and Cactus) but is now working at this new location on Bell. Loree is always willing to go above and beyond to help out customers (even staying a few minutes past closing hours when I annoyingly stroll in five minuets before they close... Sorry Loree :] ) She is extremely knowledgeable and trustworthy (obviously this is extremely important when it comes to people who are dealing with my money). I've followed her to this location because I know I can always count on her to answer all my questions. Ed the older gentleman that works here is a hoot! I absolutely love his personality! He always brightens up my day by cracking a funny joke or just simply putting a warm smile on his face! The other tellers here are just as wonderful and always are in good moods which always makes for an enjoyable environment.  This credit union has low rates for personal loans around  7.90% which in comparison to other personal loans is extremely low so for this I do thank you! Sunwest is also insured by the National Credit Union Association which helps once again ease my mind. They have 7 locations around the state and also do shared branching which makes it easier for me and I'm sure other customers to deposit money regardless of what area of town you are in . I also like that you have several different options when it comes to managing your accounts. You can choose to have money transfers automatically take place monthly without having to set yourself a reminder, they have direct deposit available which for me is extremely helpful. This credit union also has overdraft protection fees which we all know is important. Another great selling point about this company is that they also have notary public services available at all of the seven branches, and ding-ding-ding these services are at no charge to members.   So if you are sick of people you don't trust messing around with your money, if you're sick of outrageous interest rates and rude bank tellers make the switch to Sunwest and I'm sure you will be the happiest you have ever been with a Bank/Credit union!! Oh and I did forget to mention that if you suggest Sunwest to a friend or family member and they do go open an account I believe that Sunwest gives you 10  ( I'm not positive on the amount, but who cares its free money).  Thanks for making my life easy and hassle free if I could give this location ten stars I would!

Okay I think I have an obsession with this place. Its bad that its right down the street from my school because I'm constantly driving past and thinking "don't stop, don't stop" and then I stop.... Then after shopping I'm happy I stopped (maybe I'll come back tomorrow for more). Beth (the owner) is AMAZING she not only has an eye for fashion but she is super sweet!   This little shop gets new things in about once a week. They have everything ranging from dresses to nail polish. Its a small little store with big-style. Beth is sure to have the newest trends in her store and is constantly looking for the newest coolest items.  I've been in a few times now and as soon as I walk in Beth greats me with a smile and then says "Oh I have something new that would be soo cute on you" then she proceeds to show me the "cutest thing I've seen" and I must have it.  The week before my birthday I went in to look for a birthday dress.. I tried on a few different things but I didn't fall in love with anything at that moment. Beth knew that I was shopping for my special birthday dress and knows my style, she then informed me that there was a new shipment of things coming in later that day and that she had ordered a dress that she thinks I would love. I left and came back the next day to fall in love with the perfect birthday dress that fit me like a glove!! It was a black mini dress with two huge parrots  (basically take up the whole dress) I know it sounds weird but it was perfection! I mean it had to be pretty awesome to beat out the free people dress I had in mind.  Thanks for helping my birthday be one of the best I've had!!   Oh and for those of you that like to be tan, Beth also dose spray tanning here :0)

This review is for Karl's Bakery and The Bakers Daughter. I've been coming to Karl's since I was allowed to walk down the street by myself as a kid. Then some years passed and I remember walking to Karl's every morning before in high school and getting a maple long john!!! These are by far my favorite treat here... but If you want one you better be there early because they seem to sell out because they are pretty popular!  Honestly the best bakery in town! They have everything from Chocolate covered strawberries to croissants! Fresh cookies and treats made daily too! a box of Karl's goodies always makes for a great treat to bring to a party or if you're just in a good mood you could bring some donuts too your co-workers ( they will love you forever)  I love that this bakery is family owned and operated! They staff (family) is always in a good mood! Having a party and need a special order? come to Karl's to get cookies, cake and other yummy treats that your guest will love! I recently was throwing a party to celebrate my mothers fifth year of being cancer free and I was going crazy with the treat and special details. I went in to The Bakers Daughters Chocolate shop (connected to the bakery) to talk to Cristine about doing a special order of truffles for me. She wasn't there so I left my name, number and Idea with the sweet girl who was working at the time. Not even and hour later Christine called me back to discus the details. She was amazing and had no problem answering all my questions and totally went above and beyond to make me exactly what I was looking for while still working within my budget! I'm so excited to see the final product but I'm sure the little ovarian cancer ribbon chocolates will be perfect!! I wouldn't expect anything less from this amazing place.  Defiantly check out the new addition to Karl's which is called The Bakers Daughter! Everything is soooo amazing and she specializes in truffles! so many varieties my favorite is the roasted raspberry and the lavender! The truffles are a little pricey but defiantly worth it!!! They are priced in weight and are about 11$ for a 100 grams ** which comes out to around 99 cents for the normal truffles and about 1.20$ for the gourmet ones!!!  Once you have been to Karl's I swear you will be hooked!!

I'm so happy that this location is open. I think the store will do very well in this neighborhood!  The selection is smaller than other Nordstroms racks I have been to but it still very good! The staff here is very helpful and friendly. I like how they just started a new "speed check out" you can actually just walk straight up to any of their team members wearing a green shirt and check out with them instead of waiting in line. (kind cool I thought)   I'll be here often i'm sure :0)

I was in desperate need of a hair cut so I popped in keeping my fingers crossed that they had an opening for a walk in. Thankfully they did!   Go see Rayanna! Not only did she do an amazing job on my hair but she's also an extremely talented colorist and makeup artist! I promise you will walk out of there feeling and looking fabulous!!   The environment of this place is also fantastic!! I love the salon chairs! (Vintage wooden chairs that have been painted and reupholstered.. Super cute!) They also have small section of clothing and jewelry mixed in with their decent variety of salon products!   I'll be back not only for the awesome service and environment but I'm dying to sit at their amazing nail bar!! (Wonderful idea for a girls day!)

YUMMMMMM IN MY TUM!  Amazing chicken and Lemonade!  Try the #5 12 piece. I know it sounds like a lot but believe me if you get the smaller portion you will wish you had the 12 piece.

Okay the place itself is awesome and I'd give the building five stars... Where it goes downhill for me is the staff. When a few classmates and I  came for a few drinks after class we arrived and sat down at the bar. We ordered a few beers and then had to move to a bigger table to accommodate more people who were coming to join us. After we moved to a table close to the bar just big enough to accommodate all the members in our party a server came up to us and informed us that we were siting in "HIS SECTION" and he seemed annoyed to even be there. He continued to look at our table and roll his eyes at our already order drinks. Okay sir I totally understand the annoyance of guests moving around to different tables but in no case is it appropriate to give your customers attitude about moving to accommodate for a larger group of people especially on a slow night when there's plenty of tables open. Our rude server didn't come back over for at least 30 min so we continued to order food and other drinks from the bartender. When he finally came back, we had just received our nachos and more beer and once again he rolled his eyes scoffed and walked away.  We didn't seem him for the rest of the night which was fine by me.  I must say the girl behind the bar was very knowledgeable but she also wasn't too pleasant. The employees seemed to be friendly to one another and cracking jokes but as soon as they were talking to a customer it seemed like a flip was switched and they were now annoyed. I asked a few people that had been in before of what their experience was like they all said they had been in for dinner on a non-music night and the service was awful. Those who had been in during a show said they had a great time and the service was decent.   I must say that this location would be awesome for a music venue which it is... So maybe ill be back for a show but I will not be back for dinner on an off night.

mediocre. that sums it up pretty well. The staff is semi-rude and not too helpful with questions. They do not accept the Yelp Check-in offer here so don't even try. The sushi was beautiful but not so fresh. Thankfully I went during happy-hour or I would have been extremely disappointed with the full price and quality of the sushi. From what I understand they have happy hour from open - 5pm and 8pm-close. ONLY GO DURING THESE TIMES or you will be overpaying for ok sushi. I was happy with the beer and sake selection but this was probably the most impressive part of my visit. Also be sure to check your bill before you pay they over charged us for two beers we never had and a roll we never even ordered.    ***Try the Bird of Paradise roll but add jalapenos   ONLY GO HERE FOR HAPPY HOUR!!!

Let me start by saying that I used to work in the restaurant industry so I know and understand what "good service" entails. Needless to say this establishment is an absolute joke. Where should I begin...  The food- The sushi here is beyond disappointing. Not only is the presentation sloppy but I'm totally seriously when I say that it looked as if the chef threw it on the plate and sent it out, without a bat of an eye (rolls falling apart, wasabi and ginger missing, old rice particles stuck to the plate). Okay I can live with a sloppy presentation, but what I cannot deal with is fish that tastes as if its been sitting out all day long, not in a cooler (it was at best room temp, if not warm to some others opinion.) not a good sign. Old hard rice that was for sure a few days old. I'm sorry but this is unacceptable (especially when it comes to raw fish).  The service - The customer service at this establishment is beyond atrocious. A friend and I decided that we wanted sushi late one night. (8pm) We arrived, only to be ignored in an empty restaurant. I walked over to a staff member and asked if we could get some menus and sit outside. The lady nodded at me, said yes, then pointed at the menus. We grabbed the menus and sat ourselves outside. Then we waited... and waited some more... no joke 10-15 minuets had passed and I had to get up and walk inside and ask the same lady for two cups of water. She said  "ya ya, okay." then turned her back and went to grab us two waters (I returned to the table). When she finally brought us our water, she said "so you ready to order?". We ordered four rolls, edamame and a bottle of unfiltered sake. 25 min later she brought us our food. One of the rolls was wrong, but at this point we were so hungry we ate it any way (we still haven't received the sake we ordered). While we are about half way into our 2nd roll a man comes out of the restaurant and begins unplugging all the lights (time now is roughly 9pm and they don't "close" until 10:30pm). My friend and I just look at each other in darkness as we sit there on their front patio dumbfounded at what is happening. Our server comes out soon after and asks "well you need anything thing else or what?", I then told her that we never received our sake, but that we don't need it anymore because we are more than half way done with our meal. She responded with "okay, well then you pay now." (we still have food on our plates and our water glasses are bone dry) I look at my friend and then just handed the waitress cash for our bill + extra for change for the tip. She walks inside and rings us out but then never returns. We both just sat there waiting for her to come back out and bring us our change and water refills.... Nothing. Then the most amazing thing happened... They turned off the lights inside (time now 9:30). So we look at each other once again in amazement. I get up (again) and walk over to the door to find it locked! That's right you are reading this correctly. They left the restaurant and locked the doors with us still sitting on the patio with all our dishes sitting on the table!!! I have never in my life been to an place of business where the employees left customers at the facility and locked the doors behind them. As you can imagine I never revived my change and left feeling like I was just in the twilight zone.  I will NEVER EVER be back and I suggest you stay far far away from this place. There are several other places close by that have way better food and that won't turn the lights out on you and lock the doors an hour before closing time. Note to the owner - you should think twice about you have managing your business, because from what I've experienced on two separate occasions now, is the most horrific customer service I've ever come across.

I love Oregano's! The have awesome food and great service. Try the midday rush specials for lunch they have a few super cheap options for the lunch rush!!! If you're a drinker try the BELLINI! Its an amazing frozen cocktail made with red wine, rum, champagne and schnapps! It will knock your socks off in a good way!      I'm disappointed in the change of recipe for the toasted raviolis! PLEASE change it back to the original recipe it was soooooooo much better. I'm still a sucker for cheese so I will order them as an appetizer anyway but I still prefer the old recipe.  Try the Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad it is to die for! SOOOO amazing with the crunchy tortilla strips and the freshly grilled chicken, it a must try!!! But for all the salads I recommend the Jr. size because the normal size is HUGE and the Jr size is still enough for three people to share!  The Alfredo the dark and the deep dish pizzas are also great!!!   **** DON'T FORGET TO SAVE ROOM FOR THE PIZZA COOKIE!!! stick with the traditional chocolate chip version, I love peanut butter and macadamia nuts but both don't even come close to the amazingness of the original! Sure to be the best part of your visit!

I've worked several events that have taken place here. This is a great place for events such as the culinary festival, beer festival etc. The land is very well kept and always look fabulous! The security is always very friendly and make me feel safe.   This is also a great place to take a stroll or head to for a nice bike ride. You can often come across some type of event taking place (art, food, entertainment festival) There are several shops restaurants even a library close by to keep yourself entertained!   check this place out!

I'm so happy I found this little spot!   Try the Prima Chicken --- Oven roasted, hand-carved chicken, with roasted red peppers, tomato, baby spinach, provolone, basil pesto aioli on a ciabatta roll   $7.50  ** Avocado Turkey-- Oven roasted, hand-carved turkey breast, avocado slices, alfalfa sprouts, tomato and muenster with basil pesto aioli on golden, buttery croissant   $7.50   I think I like the Avocado Turkey better but they are both very good! The croissants here are to die for so flaky and wonderful they melt in your mouth!!!  They also have great Coffee options, I usually get a dirty chi and its fantastic!!  This is a great breakfast spot defiantly worth trying if you are looking for a new breakfast spot!! I'll be back for sure!!

Let me start off by saying that I was a skeptic. I've seen some pretty terrible spray tans in my day but there came a time shortly after winter where I was in desperate need of a tan, so I started doing my research and stumbled upon SunGun. Soon after I scheduled my appointment and went in to the shop to be greeting by a super sweet woman behind the counter. I checked in and was quickly introduced to my spray tech Brittany.   Brittany showed me the way to the room and walked me through the process. She was so positive and knowledgeable that I Immediately felt like I had known her for years. She made me feel so comfortable and really knew her stuff! After a few motions the session was done. Brittany explained the do's and donts to me and walked me back out to the front.   Long story short I'm beyond trilled that I found Brittany at SunGun. I will without a doubt be going back to see her soon! I highly recommend you go see her ASAP if you're looking a little pasty and you don't want to bake your skin... She's the bees knees! Keep up the awesome work!!

I love the Brat Haus! Lets just say I'm not what you would call a brat fan but this place changed me for the better! They use all fresh, natural hormone free ingredients, which makes me feel better about putting it in my body! If you've never been in before I recommend trying a brat. My favorites are the spicy brat with grilled onions or just the simple route with sauerkraut, the chorizo brat topped with the fabulous root beer onions (marinated in root beer) and the Moroccan Lamb brat with apricot onion chutney and spicy bell peppers. They just added a spicy pepper jack brat which is also fabulous! They have tons of brats to choose from besides my favorites I listed above including... a sweet brat, house brat, southwest chicken (spicy!!) a rabbit and hops brat, duck and dates, they even have a rattlesnake brat, and a veil brat. All the brats are made in house and are fresh as can be! The meat for both the brats and burgers come from Niman Ranch which means all the animals were vegetarian fed, antibiotic/hormone free and pastor raised... This can only mean that the meat you are ingesting is of the highest quality possible!   Be sure to start with a pretzel and cheese! They are DELICIOUS and the cheese dip is a three cheese beer dip that u can also top your amazing Belgian fries with but don't forget the bacon. The Belgian fries are to die for (they also have awesome garlic fries)  the fries come with your choice of dipping sauce and they have a ton to choose from... Ranch, chipotle aioli, truffle aioli, thousand island (hush hush sauce)  sriracha aioli and Blue cheese bacon. Okay I hate blue cheese but this blue cheese bacon dipping sauce is AMAZING!!! A must try! So not only do they have awesome dipping sauces for your fries but they also have a variety of mustards to choose from! They have the simple traditional catsup and mustard but they also have a whole grain, Dijon, honey mustard and curry ketchup. Try them all!  Some other note worthy menu options are- The schnitzel, crispy ribs, local tomato salad (add bacon!) and the charcuterie options!   Try and save room for the amazing date cake made with oatmeal stout and root beer (its soooooooo good!) you also can't go wrong with the butterscotch root beer float!   OHH and did I mention they have 28 beers on tap and tons of bottles to choose from? They also have an awesome happy hour!   **side note this is NOT a German food restaurant... But they do celebrate Octoberfest and its a pretty epic party!

I love TJ-MAXX the Paradise Valley location is still my favorite!  This is a great place to come for a last minuet affordable outfit. You can get everything for your night out. A dress, heels, jewelry, handbag even new shampoo to get your hair looking fresh and clean!  I do love the fact they have a beauty section here, its nice to know I can find those expensive products I never buy for myself here at a reasonable price. Its right next to the jewelry section though so have some self control! When it comes to the fashion here its a little harder to have as much control because they always have the latest styles in fashion and they make sure to keep it clean and tidy so you can actually enjoy your shopping experience.  This is also an awesome place to come to find house warming gifts for those friends you love, or just to spice up your own living space! I swear my last house was fully decorated thanks to TJ-MAXX!  Majority of the time the staff  at all locations are very friendly and helpful, I've only ever had one experience with an older lady working at the dressing room that had a very unpleasant disposition... I haven't seen her again and I hope I never do.    All in all keep it up TJ-MAXX!

Just recently bought a whole new bedding set for only 40$!!! And a lamp for 30$! Decorative pillows for 10$ I splurged.   This location is very clean and organized and the staff is super helpful and friendly!   Ill be here often.

Just left TQLA. I'm pretty Impressed actually.   The food was really good!   I had the carnitas tacos with black beans and rice.- the carnitas meat was absolutely delicious. The rice was perfectly seasoned Mexican rice and the black beans were cooked just rice with small dap of creme fresh and white Mexican cheese. The meal itself was plenty for me. Two tacos with a side of rice and beans. I was defiantly stuffed after. ~ $10.95  A couple other people had the crispy lunch chicken tacos- a little extra something than your normal chicken tacos. Also included rice and beans. ~ $9.95  Another had the chorizo and eggs (Sunday brunch special) I stole a bite and it was fabulous!! Chorizo and cilantro on top of an egg with a side of seasoned breakfast potatoes. I'd defiantly be back just for this! ($8.95)  The cocktails were also great! They have a HUGE selection of tequila and margaritas.... They even have a tequila flight. I had the berry mojito-awesome and not too sweet. The Bellini-super sweet if you're into that be prepared for a brain freeze. The skinny margarita was also so so good! Oh and if your a Bloody Mary lover they have a make your own Bloody Mary bar!! Super awesome!   Our server Danny was awesome! He was  super friendly and provided awesome service! Keep up the great work Danny!  Ill be back!

Okay. I have an obsession. But really. I have not been more excited about a new business as much as I have with this one.   First off I hate pickles so at first I was hesitant that when I went in everything would be made with pickles. This is not the case at all.   They have wine on tap. (Ummm yes please) Tots of the day. (Yes that's right they have a different "huge" tot every single day! Only 1$) Give a beer board (you can buy a beer for a friend write their name on a board and when they come in its already paid for so they can enjoy)  Amazing staff (I have yet to have bad service) Phenomenal menu (thanks to amazing head chef)  great Bar!!! Clayton is an amazing owner and has an amazing sense of humor my boyfriend an him are always cracking jokes to each other!   Try "the Nancy" but add pork belly or bacon!  I'm also a huge fan of their "cookie-ish desert! My goal is to try everything on the menu but if hard because there constantly changing the menu adding new items and mixing it up! Another highlight is their late night menu! Try the Udon Noodles soooo good!!   The braised duck leg is also a must try!   The only thing that I've had that I wouldn't be jumping at having again was the pork tostadas (not horrible just not my cup of tea)  I'm so happy that this spot is here!! By far my go to and new favorite place in town. Get there NOW!!! And may your first question be "what's your tot of the day?"

I'm sorry but I'm not a fan of Olive Garden I think all their food is awful. It tastes like it was trucked in frozen and thrown in a microwave then slapped on a plate and served. even the bread sticks taste funny (good but funny). The service is always mediocre, I'm not impressed.  Skip this spot and take yourself to Anzios Italian restaurant (locally owned) less than a mile away. There you can enjoy real Italian food and a friendly staff.  Stay away from this frozen swans-man food. Not that I have any issue with frozen food but I can make that at home myself.

I cannot express how awful my experience was here.   I came in a few weeks ago to get my fingerprints taken for a teaching program at school. When I arrived I immediately grabbed a ticket (time 11:14am) After filling out a short form I waited until 1:35pm (the time stamp on my receipt)  until my number was FINALLY called. I swear it felt like I won the lottery. So after telling the young lady behind the window that I needed to get fingerprinted for my "teaching program at school" she told me that my total would come to $6. That was shockingly low so I asked "it's only $6 to get my fingerprint clearance card?" She responded with "yes". She then asked for my fingerprint form, ID and the $6. I payed. Sat down and waited for about five min until my name was called. The nice girl made small talk and quickly took my fingerprints. After I wiped the ink off my hands she handed me back the form with my fingerprints on it. I thought this was odd so I asked "so this is my fingerprint clearance card? This is all I need?" She replied with "yep that's it! Easy as that". I then left to enjoy some lunch. A few days later I took the finger print card to the school I'm attending and this is when they informed me that "this is the wrong card".... (This is when I knew it was about to get nasty.) They provided me with a blue envelope with a few forms I needed to fill out then take back  to this location and have them mail the fingerprints for me. After that I would receive a different card... which is the card I need ("The verified prints").   So again I headed back to this inconvenient location (hard to find if you have never been here). I filled out the forms in the blue envelope grabbed a number then headed to the information window. I informed the officer of my problem... He then explained that because I didn't come back the day after that there may be an issue with the date and I may have to get re-fingerprinted but he was going to check with the supervisor.(Getting annoyed....) I handed him my ID, a receipt for the original fingerprints and the actual fingerprint form. He told me to take a seat and he would see what he could do. I sat down and shortly after he came out and sat down next to me. He explained that because the fingerprints left the building  I was going to have to get re-fingerprinted and that I also needed a cashiers check for $67 to get the "Identity Verified Prints" he said "read this form and it will have everything you need to know". I then expressed my understanding of his reason and asked him if I was going to have to pay another fee for the actual prints ($6). He said yes. This is when I asked him to speak with the supervisor. He relied with "I have already spoken with her, and this is what she said so your not going to get anywhere with her." I then told the officer I'd prefer to speak with the supervisor in person. He continued to repeat that I was "not going to get anywhere with her". Feeling beyond frustrated I left the facility, ran to the bank to get a cashiers check and quickly arrived back in the waiting area with 8 people in front of me. (Oh ps. The form says you need a check for $69 and the officer told me $67) Waiting for my number to be called was like sitting on a barbed wire... All I wanted to do was get up and scream bloody murder. Finally my number was called and I approached "window number five" the nice young girl behind the counter asked what I needed I told her (now knowing) "the verified fingerprint card" she took my blue envelope with the check for $67, my ID and entered my information into the computer then gave me a total of $6. I payed then immediately asked for the supervisor. The supervisor Dina came over and I asked her for a number or email address where I could file a complaint. She proceeded to write down a number and hand it over to me. Not once did she ask what the problem was or if she could help in anyway. Weird... isn't that part of your job description? With no questions asked she just walked away as if the problem was solved.  I again waited for my name to be called so I could get fingerprinted for the second time. Thank god the technician working Vanessa was a breath of fresh air. She was super sweet and very friendly... honestly she was the ONLY pleasant thing about my experience. Keep up the good work Vanessa!!  I know it's only $6 and its not the money part that gets me but the fact they didn't offer to waive the fee. Nor did the supervisor try what so ever to resolve the issue or even seem interested in addressing the needs of a customer. I don't care who needs what or when but if your a customer you deserve good customer service. Period.   If you can get ur prints done at a different location I highly recommend it.  **Side note. I did call back later that day to file a complaint. I spoke with Dina and she took the time to listen to my complaint and apologized for my unpleasant visit. Hopefully they work on how to better their customer service.

Awful. The only decent thing about this place is the set up (cool upper deck seating with a nice view). This is the ONLY good thing about his place. I went in last night for dinner and was blown away with the awful service. We were not greeted. Sat ourselves upstairs (as the "bartender" sat behind the bar and texted) we sat without menus or being greeted for 5 min. I then had to ask for a menu, was given one menu (for two of us and no drink list). After we looked over the menu still no server in sight... We waited another five min before I had to get up walk down stairs and ask for two waters myself. Again we waited... FINALLY our server (who was nice but seemed to be totally lost) showed up. We asked for a drink list which took another five min. Still no drink list... Asked again and finally she brought it up to our table.   We ordered our food, still no drinks.. About five minuets later we finally received our beers. The food arrived shortly after which surprised me since everything else took forever.. The only problem was we were not given any utensils,  no napkins, no side plates. Had to ask the server to bring all theses things. After a few minuets she returned and I took my first bite of our carne asada tacos... They were cold, not just a little chilly, it seemed like they were sitting in a fridge prior, the meat was bland and cold and the tortillas were stale and also cold. We also ordered a grilled chicken burrito. It was terrible, once again it was cold. At this point I was just so confused and told myself they couldn't possibly mess up the tortilla chips until I tried one. The chips were drenched with salt, I'm not talking a little too much salt I'm talking about chips COVERED in salt. They were awful and inedible.   I'm so disappointed everything we ordered was just pathetic. I asked our server for our tab as soon as she was in sight and asked nicely to speak with a manager. A manager came up and I informed his of how awful the food was and also told him that the staff should be a little more aware of their surroundings. I work in this business and I know how it important it is for everyone to work together.. This includes the front and back of house including managers. I felt like the servers and bartenders were not trained correctly and the manager I spoke with totally agreed. I don't remember his name but I know he is the bar manager.   ***Note to the owners of this place. LISTEN to your bar manager he seems to know where the problems are and he seems to really care about making changes to better this place. Your staff really needs to get on the same page and work as a team. I won't be back, and if things don't change soon I recommend their bar manager leave for a place that will last. Without a strong team there's nothing.   Very disappointed I was excited to try this place.

So happy this place moved into the neighborhood! This is a great place to end a family bike ride! in fact you get happy hour all day long if you ride up on your bike. $5 pitchers for happy hour and great food options on the happy hour menu! our server Kaitlin was great! She was extremely knowledgeable and extremely personable. Keep up the great work Kaitlin!  Try they tacos all of them are great! (The fish tacos are a little bland but still pretty good!) The Sangria was also really delicious... Very fresh!  I also like what they have done with the inside... Still a little gloomy and dark inside but not to shabby on the new decor. The patio is great and could use some decoration love or maybe some cool plants but still has amazing potential! (This patio would be great with a fire pit or heaters in the winter time)   I'll be back to try some more awesome food and enjoy the great atmosphere!

I'm beyond thrilled I found this place! Nori is outstanding!!   Sushi- Try the Poke Poki Roll, I love tuna poke so I was anxious to try this roll. The crumbled Doritos on top give it an awesome crunch. The Sakana Trio might be one of the most delicious rolls I have ever had. This roll has fresh Ahi, Yellowtail and Salmon layered atop and garnished with citrus popping BOBA. Another must try is the Ahi Tuna Tataki roll! I love the crispy onions and house made tataki dressing that make this roll one of my favorites.  Don't pass up the Tropical Hamachi and The Tuna Carpaccio both served sashimi style, which I love!   For all you non sushi foodies there is plenty to choose from! Try the Yakisoba noodles with chicken, you won't be disappointed. A few other noteworthy non-sushi dishes include, The Rib-eye Yakitori, The Galbi short rib plate, Breaded Pork Katsu and The melt in your mouth Miso Chilean Sea Bass. Honestly I have yet to try one bad thing on the menu, even the salads are amazing (try the Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad).  I almost forgot to mention that they also have a Prosciutto "sushi" roll thats made for those who don't eat fish.  Be prepared to have your socks knocked off after trying the Green Tea Waffle with Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert... All I can say is YUMMMMMM!  Okay so I know I raved about the amazing food but what makes me love this place even more is the extensive Sake list and awesome cocktails. Being a sake lover I was thrilled to see the amazing choices of sake I could choose from. My two favorites are the nigori and The Zipang, but If you're more into cocktails try the Thai Heat which has a fiery kick to it or the Blueberry Shisojito for a nice refreshing drink.  All in all this place has super fresh, one of a kind sushi, and amazing kitchen menu, amazing beverages to choose from not to mention their knowledgeable awesome team makes for a great experience all together. I'll be back and i'm bringing friends!!   Oh and one more thing... They have an awesome Happy Hour (M-F between 3-6pm) and an awesome wine special on Mondays!!

Absolutely the worst service ever. It took us ten min and me asking someone to get service. Another 20 min to get beers and the wait staff is rude. This place is also filthy!! I suggest health inspectors come see this place ASAP. The ladies restroom was so gross. Toilet paper all over the place, a sink clogged and over flowing with rancid stagnant water and there was feces on the wall of a stall. I can't imagine what their kitchen looks like.   The food isn't bad but not amazing. The pretzels were impressive. Wish the service was as half decent as the pretzel.   Night life here is again interesting.... You wait in an line at the bar for about ten minuets when u finally reach the bar you're getting hit on by sweaty man who's wearing way too much cologne. The drinks are nothing special and the service all around is again less than stellar.   Not impressive.  Review update!!! I went back against my will but I must say that Molly the server is awesome. By far the best service I have EVER received at HiFi. Note to the owners and managers keep this girl around. She is on top of her game and actually seems to care about the company. She wasn't our server at first and was still super attentive!! (She ended up being our server in the end.) Congrats Molly on being an amazing server and changing my negative attitude towards this establishment. Keep up the great work Molly!!

First off I must mention that I'm beyond excited for this concept! Payton Curry is in da haus with some fantastic ceviche options! Wardy is stepping up his food game and rocking out some amazing things from the kitchen! Oh and for all you gluten free peeps out there, you'll be beyond thrilled with all the options you'll have with this amazing menu! Which by the way is all about LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL!! Almost everything that comes out of this kitchen is locally grown, hormone and preservative free and FRESH! They even have the fish flown in 6 days a week!  Lets start with appetizers... The chips are made in house daily, lightly salted and gluten free! The table side guacamole is super fresh and made to order. All three fundidos are amazing so don't forget to give those a try too! Both the Albondigas and the Tortilla soups are flavorful and heart warming. If your looking for a salad you've come to the right place! The shaved Kale salad is AMAZING!! (yes I am now a believer that kale can be amazing! PS. add chicken) The Haus Chopped has a creamy cilantro dressing that's drinkable it so good! (please don't drink the dressing that would be gross) The Jicama salad surprised me. It was super crisp and refreshing! (make sure to add tuna or shrimp)    I tried all the empanadas and they all were fantastic... or what the tacotarians call "pillows of bliss". My favorite was the Carne Asada only because I loved the seasonings on the meat and how they compliment  the cilantro crema on the bottom of the plate... but seriously they are all awesome!   $3 TACOS!!! OH yeahhhh! You can mix and match your own little taco stand to please your cravings!! Choose from: Fresh fried fish, mouth watering pork belly, in haus rotisserie chicken, marinated carne asada or local veggies! They all come served on their haus made gluten free tortillas!   There's two options for how you'd like to go about the main entree portion of dinner. You can go ahead and order your own entree or theres also a section on their menu called "taquiza" and those are entree options for two to share! Both sections have amazing options like grilled tuna, scallops, beef or pork tenderloin, flank steak, you can even order a whole rotisserie chicken. (They have other options too, but these are a few of my favorites).  Now for my favorite part.... The ceviche!! I was nervous at first but I gave them all a shot and I'm so happy I did. The Halibut was by far my favorite. It melts in your mouth with its buttery taste and texture and kicks you at the end with a citrus note. The Ahi ceviche was my runner up, SUPER FRESH! I'm not a shrimp or scallop person but I went out on a limb and tried them both... The shrimp was light and refreshing and the scallops were herbal and buttery, to both I'd give a thumbs up! All ceviche is served in an avocado.  Desserts --THE TRES LECHES IS TO DIE FOR!!! The flan and homemade chocolate bar are also mouth watering!   One tequila, two tequila, three tequila... more? Taco Haus has over 36 tequilas, 20+ beers (including big bombers!), an amazing wine list (+ sangria), Haus cocktails that will knock your socks off and duh! tons of awesome margaritas!!! Be sure to try the Vergara Margarita- which is Serrano infused,  soooo good!  Okay okay so the food and drinks are amazing but that's not it! Taco Haus has an awesome environment and a killer staff! And once again they support local business. They even had a local artist come in and paint the walls! All in all it really is comes down to... Tacos, Tequila, Ceviche, Cerveza... I'm sold.

I'll start by saying that I'm SOO beyond happy that I found this hidden gem! I've been coming  here since they first opened and I'm still a huge fan!!!  The atmosphere is awesome! Even when it's dead there's a great vibe going on here. The outside patio is wonderful for larger groups and perfect for a nice Sunday funday gathering. Rose-all-day baby!! The accent painted wall is a nice touch and ties in perfectly with the twisted classy feel of the inside bar.   Now to the service. The service has been absolutely outstanding every time I'm here! All the bartenders are super personable, have amazing attitudes not to mention make some incredible cocktails. I would say that the majority of them are extremely knowledgeable on all ends of the spectrum. The servers are also super friendly and know their stuff! Like I said before I have yet to have bad service here and I doubt I will! I must give a double high five to the friendly manager who is clearly doing a good job of training his staff and running this posh little place!!   On to the food. All I can say is BRAVO!! All the main entrées are spectacular! The southern fried chicken is mouthwatering. The Chinese char siu ribs with smoked peanuts and cilantro pesto are to die for and I could easily live off of the lemon chimichurri cauliflower and mason jar chopped salad for the rest of my life.  *** Also a little secret.... You can bring your dog along if you choose to sit on the front patio!!   Way to go guys! Keep up the amazing work!

Stayed over on the Fourth of July to celebrate my best friends birthday. We hung out by the pool all day and enjoyed the friendly staff  bringing us drinks pool side. The pool was soooo hot like bath water, sometimes this isn't bad but when it's 115 outside your getting in a pool to cool down not to boil. After enjoying our time pool side we headed back to the room for the night.   The room was beautiful. Mexico vibe living room area and two beds in the room connecting. The bathroom was also really nice...  Big. The layout of the room was interesting, but still comfortable. I also liked that we had a small little balcony with a nice view! Everything was great but during the night the ac broke. We tried to suck it up but we were steaming hot! It's was soooo hot we ended up leaving. No bueno. The next morning we came back to check out of the room and when we explained what happened they took care of our room for us. That's was I call awesome hospitality! The staff all around was awesome and made my experience a great one! Ill be back for sure, despite the mishap with the air.

2.99$ car wash and free vacuums! The 2.99$ price is for a plain and simple wash and you can upgrade to more detailed washes if you would like. The customer service is pretty decent and the location itself is easy to find and access. If you want a simple fast wash without a hassle this is a great place to come. All washes come with a hand dry! Can't beat the deal here!
