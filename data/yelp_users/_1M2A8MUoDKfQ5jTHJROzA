Can you review non-service? This place tried to ruin my Sunday...but its cool. I'm cool man. I'm cool. I went to the George and Dragon with 4 friends this last Sunday afternoon for a breakfast/brunch and some hair of the dog after a night of trying to kill my stupid liver and all will be well in the world. Right? Found out from the owner's mouth they'll be featured on Bar Rescue soon. This might have been my first hint of things to come but hey this is my first time here and I'll give 'em a shot yeah? The owner is on the patio with his friends drinking and partying. Cool, If I owned a bar and it wasn't slammed (it seemed chill) I'd probably party on a Sunday afternoon too.  The bartender comes out to the patio to take our order. I am patiently waiting my turn to order, I know what I want and I am prepared to deliver this information is in simple and easy to remember terms. We're a five top; she takes 4 orders:1.eggs Benedict, a mimosa, 2. a water and a coke, 3. chicken fried steak, a beer, 4. a chorizo burrito, a beer 5...uh oh, the order's getting too big and she didn't prepare with pen and paper so she's going to go get some and...wow, its odd that I'm still able to remember everyones order and I didn't even write it down, thats weird & then she walks off without taking mine?! I am not sure why.  It wasn't like I was distracted or on my phone or ignoring the event or giving her a dirty look or nuthin'.  But she just walked off as I was trying to order. 5 minutes goes by...so now I've got to follow her inside to order. Okay, no biggie, maybe she just was distracted. It's cool. I'm a mellow dude. I go in and ask if I can also place an order and all will be well in the world. Right? She's busy entering orders into the POS computer.  She says she'll be with me in a minute.  Ok. Cool. A couple walks up next to me at the bar. She'll be with them in a minute.  Ok. cool...so I now assume I'll place my order and head back outside and then the couple that walked up after me will place their order and all will be well in the world. Right? She takes their order first! I'm annoyed because I was there first and I just got done chasing her down and well ok what ever so long as I get to order. So I wait. Finally she acknowledges me, but...she seems a little distracted?  Hmmm....maybe she really was slammed but then why is the owner partying outside lol? ok. I am also a very forgiving person so whatevs...I just want a mimosa and some breakfast.  I order. She says she'll bring it out to the patio with the rest of my friends order. So...cool. I see her enter my order on the POS!  I go outside thinking all will be well in the world. Right?  Our drinks come. To me thats proof that the error has been corrected since my beverage came out with all the others. My mind is at ease and all will be well in the world. Right? 20 minutes later...here comes the bartender...with all the food... except mine....Oh yeah, did I mention it was only 4 out of 5 of us ordering actual food so...yeah...mine didn't come. She explains she'll be right back with mine and walks back inside. All will be well in the world...gulp....Right? Guys? ...right? ...guys? 10 minutes go by... my pals are halfway thru their meals. Another waitress walks up and asks if we're all doing okay. I say no, I am waiting for food and explained that the bartender was supposedly coming right back with it... 10 minutes ago and my friends are almost done eating. She asks if I still want the order. "SIGH....uh....if you can bring it quickly sure." I was still polite. She goes inside... about 5 minutes later the bartender comes out to tell me they are still working on my order. I have nothing to add to the conversation so she walks back inside. 5 minutes go by.  Worst customer service experience I've had in a long time.  My friends are done eating.  I'm done with my drink. I'm done waiting for food. I'm done with this bar. I won't ever come back, not even for free snacks. I pay for my drink without a word. On the upside I saved money on a tip. She tries to explain that they gave my breakfast away to someone else.  Perfect. I don't have any words. I leave. It was suggested by a friend who was with me that I complain but that to me seems like a practice in futility. I already brought it to two peoples attention and there were no positive results. Besides, you can't upset a fat man over food and expect him to be rational.  If the bartender hasn't figured it out by now there's no fixing it. I mean didn't they just have a team of pros swoop in to save their business?  I think Bar Rescue missed a spot when they painted the place; they should've painted a big sign out front that read "Under new management, now hiring competent staff!" or maybe "GOOD NEWS! We're shutting our doors! Going out of business sale!" Terrible Pub 1(after all the mimosa was okay & the bartender apologized) Bar Rescue 0, hung over light rail rider...also a 0 and all was well in the world. Right? Guys?

Great staff. Outstanding service. Thank you Joe, Wolf, Cathy and Kyle.  Really know how to treat customers. If you decide to buy a used motorcycle from these people be prepared for helpful staff to assist you in finding the right bike. The guy in charge, Joe and my salesman, Wolf and Cathy, the lady who reminded me of the wife on the Sopranos(in a good way) took great care of me and made sure I got the right bike. There was an issue with the bike and service took care of it and got me a loaner. Great place.

Went in to buy coffee and use internet. The snot nosed child behind the counter informed me that they were closing in 20 minutes, mind you it was 940pm. I informed her that the website yelp.com indicated that the hours of operation were till 10:30p and she might want to have someone update that. She said :"I have no control over that."and went on about her business.  We specifically went to this place to drink coffee and use the wifi and I figured that helping them get IT right was the right thing to do so I said "I'm sure the manager can update those hours, you know the manager right?" she said "Oh, do I?" "I don't know you work here. you know what? we're going to skip the coffee we don't like this rude attitude goodbye" can't rate these asshole's coffee cause I didn't have any. Skipped the wifi too.  It gets better.  After I leave I call up and ask for the name of the manager. Its the child again. I am told that I am rude and condecending. Maybe, but I didn't ask for your opinion on the subject just the name of the manager. They say something unfriendly and Then a dial tone. Hung up on me.  I dont know about yall but next time I want  coffee I wont try to buy it from Cynthia.

Great food. Server was great. Problem with bill. Manager not helpful at all. Had Groupon didnt notice it was for 4 people. Was just me and my girl. Ya got me! He offered cash value or vouchers but not full value. Came for the deal. Really enjoyed the meal. Not the bitter after taste he left behind tho.

The ribs are super excellent smokey goodness. The smashed potatoes have smoke gouda on them for the win!  The asparagus was perfectly cooked yum yum yum! The apple pie moonshine tasted way better than expected.  Friendly waitstaff, great ambiance and comfortable decor.  Two people $46 with tip.  Well worth every penny.

This is the place to go if you need great service. Everyone I've encountered here has been a prime example of good people with great skills and know how. Prices are fair and the selection is varied and well stocked.  If you are in the market for a fixed gear or single speed bike check them out.

Outstanding food and service. My girlfriend started feeling a little under the weather right before we ordered and the nice ladies that own the place made her a special ginger garlic chicken and rice soup. Best thing off the menu!!! They also brought out hot tea. Nice!  Now best thing on the menu was the yellow curry chicken. Incredible!

Premium professionalism. This dude is officially my "computer guy!" quick honest reliable friendly. Its all there.  And right down the way from my casa. The only way it could be any better is if I didn't goof up my computer with porn and funny pictures of cats. Jk. Seriously, not sure how to leave a better endorsement for this business. There's a lot of "computer experts" out there who'll take yer hard earned money and do as little as possible to help out and then there's this guy. We don't need Donald Trump to make America great again. We just need more hard working honest professionals like this feller here! Now get off my lawn!

The first thing I notice about the place are the staff. Good people! Friendly and fast service with a smile. Decor is suitable . tables and chairs but also ample couches and outdoor patio seating. The Kennedy for the win. Eggs, avocado, bacon and cream cheese on a ciabatta roll. Hot, fresh, simple and flavorful. No salt or pepper required. The coffee is always the first thing I try in a coffee spot and their coffee was acceptably hot and fresh and just well normal coffee as expected. Very satisfying. I will try a fancy drink next time....and there will definitely be a next time.
