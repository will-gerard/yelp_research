Fresh and excellent sushi! I've been going here since 2005 and always get great service and excellent food. I especially enjoy going for happy hour from 5pm-7pm and sitting at the sushi bar.  This place is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall and has an intimate vibe. It's great for a date night or for a night out with some friends. It's best to make reservations on the weekends, though, because it gets quite busy.   My favorites: pan-fried gyoza, spicy tuna roll, Shimogamo roll, panko roll, spider roll, tsunami roll, caterpillar roll & rainbow roll.

This gem of a coffee house is nestled in downtown Gilbert. It has a large, wonderful patio with lots of places to sit in sun or shade and is filled with flowers. There is also indoor seating as well.  I love riding my bike here with friends and enjoy sipping coffee, which is roasted on site. There are also yummy baked goods to nosh on if you're hungry. In addition to coffee, Bergies also offers a variety of tea and smoothies with or without protein.   This is an idyllic spot to meet friends or curl up in one of the comfy chairs and read a book. Since there's Wi-Fi, telecommuters can also enjoy the atmosphere while working.   Bergie's has live music & game nights on the weekends. From time to time they offer a coffee roasting 101 class too. It's simply a delightful oasis in the downtown Gilbert heritage area.

I've been bringing my kids here since their very first dental appointment. The staff and docs are super thorough and friendly. There is a train theme and a train table in the office which makes it fun for many ages but especially for the little ones.

I LOVE my training studio! It is filled with fantastic coaches and team members. This is the place for you if you want to perfect the quality of your movements. They have helped me get stronger, improve my endurance, increase my mobility and taught me how to make the best nutritional choices. I'm hooked for life!

Zynergy is a wonderful pampering oasis in Gilbert, AZ.  The owners have put a lot of thought into the services they offer as well as how the salon looks and feels.  The front of the salon always has trendy accessories and clothing.  It's tough not to look and tougher not to purchase.  I've been going to Wendy Heyden for many years for my cut and color.  She is truly amazing with hair and listens to what you want as well as suggests a particular cut/color that would be fab on you.  She's always right too.  Recently I've tried the Keratin Express straightening and absolutely LOVE it.  My hair is silky smooth, straight and the frizz is gone.  Over the holidays I treated myself to the pumpkin enzyme facial and Heather, the esthetician, is super wonderful and very gentle.  This particular facial really helped clear and brighten my complexion.  I'm definitely going to treat myself more often to this service.  Zynergy carries awesome products too.  I've tried the Moroccan Oil products and especially love the hair spray.  It smells soooo good!  And they carry Skin Script Skin Care which is a Tempe, AZ based company with fantastic products.  Currently I'm using the facial wash and my skin has never been better.  The other amazing Skin Script product is the Glycolic Retinol Pads.  This product in conjunction with the cleanser has helped me battle mild acne and some facial hyperpigmentation.  Amazing!!!

My hubs and I tried this place out in March 2015 for his birthday. Although we enjoyed the look/decor of the place, there was no music playing so all you'd hear was the kitchen clatter echoing through the dining area.   We ordered the charcuterie board as an appetizer which we enjoyed. Everything else after that was just "meh."   We had clam chowder, ribeye steaks, mashed cauliflower and mixed veggies all of which tasted bland, as if it was prepared cafeteria style. It looked very appetizing but it was disappointing.   We skipped dessert because they were out of chocolate cake and the creme brûlée wasn't set. The price for the food was too expensive for the quality & atmosphere.   I will say that our waitress was lovely and gave us wonderful service.

If you want high quality organic food, this place is for you. Coconut Hut offers smoothies, acai & pitaya bowls, organic coffee & tea as well as other options.   I stop in here about 2 times per week to get coffee and some breakfast on the way to Funktional Fitness where I work. There are times when I don't have time to make breakfast and I was thrilled this place opened. Makes it easy for me to stop in and know I'm fueling my body with the best food.   Hooray for the Coconut Hut!
