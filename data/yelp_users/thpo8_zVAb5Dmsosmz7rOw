I absolutely loveeee this place. My son has been getting cuts from Jessica for the past two years and not once have we been disappointed. If your child hates haircuts this is the place to go.  I even make the drive from El Mirage to come here.

Worst service ever. I feel like everyone here has an attitude problem. They don't even greet or thank you. Ugh. I now drive out of my way to avoid this sbux.

Ughhh this is the WORST 99 cent only store. It is so freaking dirty. Seriously,  who manages this place??? The workers are down right lazy and rude. I wonder if they keep their home the same way?! Everything is misplaced all over the place and trash all over the ground. And the customers there let their bay bay snot nosed kids run around. It just seems like everyone (the customers and cashiers) don't give a damn about their personal hygiene and cleanliness. Learned my lesson to never, ever go back.

Came upon this salon on a last minute rush to get eyebrows waxed and nails done. This place lost stars due to unhygienic reasons. After my technician  cut my nails and cuticles, she proceeded to place the tools back in her cart. Clear indication that they do not sterilize here. She worked fast and nails turned out great. I then went on the get a facial wax and that's where things got even worse. I asked her to take a LITTLE off the brow and now I'm stuck looking like a clown with my pencil thin eyebrows. She also burned me with the hot wax. She also used one stick through out the whole waxing process, going from my face and back to the wax warmer. Needless to say I will not return nor recommend. Such a shame because the prices are decent and nails looked nice  unfortunately I can't risk my chances of getting an infection from here.

SMH where to start.... I wish I would have read the reviews before ordering but we were lazy and already on the road.   First off I called in a to-go order and the girl who helped me was really nice. Ordered the country fried steak meal, everyday slam and some extra sausage and pancakes. What I DID NOT order was the dawn pancake puppies thingy that I was charged for. Lucky for them it was only $2 so it was not worth my time and effort to complain about it, that's what yelp is for :)  Anyway,  the nice girl said that it would take 15-20 minutes which is understandable,  especially for a Sunday morning. Went in to pick up after 20 minutes...order not ready. 30 minutes, still nada. 45 minutes of waiting we finally receive the food. The hubby said our order came out in batches.   Got home, sure enough some food was cold, some still hot. The chicken fried steak was one of the worst I've ever had. The steak was tasted processed and the sauce on top very gelatinous.  The hash browns were overcooked and freezer burnt.  My sausage and pancakes were pretty good though. The eggs OMG tasted as if it was really really old. I've never experienced anything like it. I wanted to barf after one bite.   Now I know you shouldn't expect much from chain restaurants but the food should be at least decent. I honestly believe their ingredients used were well past their due date.   Please please stay away from this location. You don't want to risk getting sick.

I prefer Ulta over Sephora because the employees are less snooty. If you sign up with their rewards program they will send you coupons and promotions quite often. Great selection on beauty products including drug stores brands. I've been coming in recently to pick up a few things from this fairly new line called "It Cosmetics". The undereye concealer has the most aaamazing coverage for dark circles. So far I believe it can only be found at Ulta, QVC, and the brand website.

My favorite Fry's location ever!!!  What I love:  Outstanding customer service. Whenever I happen to pass by a Fry's employee I always get a friendly "hello". Everyone is very helpful and actually act like they want to help you instead of treating you like a nuisance.    Produce area is kept clean, have yet to come across a rotten piece of fruit.  They have recently introduced more organics.   Aside from groceries they have a small electronics area, arts and crafts,  home goods from bed linens to furniture,  beauty products, a sushi counter and Starbucks.   Oh, almost forgot the gas center.   You can pretty much get all of your shopping done in one trip which I do to avoid the crowd at Wal-Mart.   Really happy with how Fry's has stepped their game up and continue to keep up with the quality of the products they sell.

Always super fast service when I come. I cant say much about the food because I only stop by for the drinks. If you don't already know, happy hour is everyday from 2pm-4pm.

By far the SLOWEST Starbucks in the valley. I don't come here often but always wait 20 monutes, even at non peak hours. Currently waiting as I type, took 14 minutes to even order! Two stars for friendly service.

We had been on a serious manhunt to PURCHASE (not lease) a preowned 4runner with 3rd row seating. With the help of Brian Buckley, we were able to end that search. I appreciate his zero pressure approach while I was checking out the vehicle. I knew what I did and did not want and I was not going to settle for anything less. After we made our decision it was on to finance. Again, I did not feel belittled or pressured to buy add ons and extra warranties. I am confident in the vehicle I bought and covered until 100k miles (Toyota certified)   Now the cons: We received our first bill from an unknown financial institution. Funny because we came in with a preapproval from Desert Schools and wanted to finance through them. I did not want my credit report to be run again. However, no big deal since the interest rate was reasonable. So I made several phone calls, left messages for the finance manager and sent emails just to confirm that this CRB auto is my lien holder but no response for a couple of days. I felt brushed off after they got my money and was very  disappointed.   The tire pressure light was on and we asked numerous times for that to get checked out. It went back for a wash and one last check before we left. Came back 20 minutes later....Hmmm, light still on. Was told that it may take 30 minutes to go away. A day or two passes and the hubby decides to check it himself. Pressure in all four tires were inconsistent, some high and some low. The cap for the oil was also missing. Not major issues but would have appreciated more care before before I drove off the loft with my huge investment.

Soooo they added a fabric section and nobody to work there??? My grandma went in wanting to buy fabric and waited over 40 minutes while some lazy ass employees from other departments tried to page whoever the hell was supposed to be in fabrics. Finally after the 40 minutes they decide to use their brain and cut the damn fabric themselves.  Honestly there's no changing this issue because wal-mart just does not give a rat's ass.

I absolutely LOVE this place. Seafood was fresh and on point. Not too much batter to fish ratio, just right. We ordered fried oysters, cod, fries and hush puppies. Large portion and seasoned perfectly.  I must aay, the condiment bar and fountain drink area was VERY clean. (Something I pay a lot of attention to) even the bathroom was kept very clean and had a fresh scent I  there. Anyway, you know the food is good when my very picky five yr enjoys it. Must try!!

Waited at the counter for a few good minutes before I was finally acknowledged, (the man was pacing back and forth so I'm positive he knew I was there. Anyway, decided to stop by just because I was already inside grocery shopping. Ordered the avocado boba and again, waited and waited. The whole ordeal was about 20 minutes. Finally got my drink and definitely tasted like some cheap a** artificial stuff. You could tell that they didn't use real avocado. What a waste of money. I feel bad for the people trying boba for the first time at this joint. Please try bomboba! It's in the same plaza by subway.

visited Prado for my 22nd birthday dinner. Sad to say that this place is just OK. We started off with the burrata appetizer served with foccacia bread (which was untoasted). flavor was good but hard to enjoyed with cold, chewy bread. I had the sea scallops with chorizo risotto. Dish came with 3 beautifully cooked and seasoned scallops and mediocre risotto. The mister got the gnocchi dish which was excellent, however portion size was SO small. Enjoyed two cocktails one with some ginger syrup, great. I do not recommend the purple haze drink. Overall, the menu selection was small and the cuisine did not meet the standards of fine dining. Total ripoff and I would not return.

We dine here almost every week. Food is always delicious. Service is friendly and FAST. Not sure the exact happy hour times but I think the apps are half off. I recommend the Fettuccine Carraba and calamari.

Yelp, you failed me on this one. I'm going to break this down  easy.   Chicken strips-over cooked, dry, and mostly breading  Garlic parmesan fries- fries tossed in burnt garlic oil hidden under a mound of fake, processed parmesan powder  Corned beef hash- flavorless,  mushy yet at the same time burnt pieces of potatoes.   Eggs (ordered over medium) -too runny     Pancakes with bacon- was delicious

My favorite for Vietnamese food! Hmmmm what more can I say.   Well first off the dining are is large and kept clean. Decor is nice and simple. I like that they keep extra utensils (forks, spoons, extra plates and scissors) out for the guests to self serve. I like as little human interaction as possible LOL  The service is straight to the point. They're not going to stand around all day and kiss your ass. I'm sorry but get used to it. Luckily I'm accustomed to it and enjoyed not being bothered sometimes.   We usually order cafe sua da, pennywort drink, pho, com tam with bi and bbq pork chops, the spring roll and eggrolls. The quality of the dishes have never gone down or varied from visit to visit.   The prices here are also the best in Phoenix. You can get a rice dish for under $6 and the banh mi is only $3.50. Three of us went in and only spent about $25 and left with full bellies.   I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone trying Vietnamese food for the first time :)

I'm honestly not very happy with this location. The service seriously pissed me off. Went through the drive thru, tried to place my order and was interrupted every time with "will that complete your oder" "is that all for you today" ummmm I'll be done when I actually have a chance to stop speaking. I hate hate hate being cut off. Do tou or do you not want me to spend my money here? I only had four drinks btw.

I started going to Desert West Ob-Gyn back in 2008. I saw Dr. Tom regularly during my pregnancy. She is ahhhmazing! I was 16 at the time and she made me feel so comfortable. (The hospital staff didn't take the teen pregnancy too well) Come the day that I was in labor, Dr. Tom wasn't available so Dr. Zhang filled in and delivered my little boy. Saw her again after many years and she still remembered bits and pieces of my delivery :) very very nice doctor.

I came for the crab legs and nothing else. Food here is pretty freaking sad. Being Asian, I do eat quite a few weird things. But frog legs...seriously...? Waitress came by and filled my sprite cup with water and a damp FRUIT FLY. This place is a joke... I can't even...omg....This place sucks.

Sooooo I thought I'd try the "nicer" Walmart from what I've been hearing and this location had the scrubs I needed for work. the aisles are small and narrow. Carts are scattered everywhere by employees doing go backs. But seriously, do you need four barely filled carts in ONE section for go backs. Might i add they were lollygagging around. Other customers are rude as hell and have no respect for you or your space.  Drove an extra 5-6 miles to come here; ugh big mistake.

Based on my one visit here I must say it's not too bad. You know what you're getting for the price. It's easy, cheap, great for parties and good enough. Picked up some pizzas for 5 hungry kiddos and I was in and out. Pizza tasted fresh, lots of pepperoni, and cooked just right.

Love love love this little hidden gem in South Phoenix. They had a nice selection of party decor, pinatas and Mexican candies. Everything is priced inexpensively. I got a HUGE Minion pinata for my son which only ran me about $20. The staff here is really friendly and welcoming. I feel in most Hispanic owned stores I am treated a little differently but that simply was not the case here! Please stop by and check out the place.

Nice little restaurant...loved that the menu included pictures of every dish. Food was delicious and service was nice but not too over bearing. I gave a four star rating because we did wait quite a little for our check.

I do not recommend this salon. I asked for a mid-fade with zero on the sides and a 3 on top. what he got was a fade that started well above his ears and a much larger forehead. By that time, it is too late.... Now I understand that these are kids we are talking about, but my son is 5 and very cooperative. I do give the stylists the benefit of the doubt because it was busy with just two employees doing cuts, managing phones and cleaning. That is the reason I am giving two stars instead of one.

Came here on a warm summer night and it was quite warm inside the restaurant as well (a little stuffy) aside from that the sushi was really nice and fresh.  Too bad they don't serve mixed drinks but they do have some bottled Japanese beer.  The food came out quickly and wait staff was courteous. However we asked for a box and we're clearly finished eating and after about 10 min we finally asked for the check. (It was not busy and the waiter walked by several times already) he came back with the check, and walked away for about another 10 minutes. Lol.  The was a little frustrating being that the place wasn't busy and is small enough to see that we were ready to pay. None the less I would definitely go back for the sushi.

First off, service is always awesome when I'm here. They slice the deli meat and cheese to order, more brownie points from me.  Store is nicely kept, lobby is always clean. Food line is nice and tidy which is a major pet peeve of mine. 5 stars all the way!

I've tried really really hard to like this place. Tried the pasta, ramen and chahan. So far, the only dish worth buying again was the chahan (fried rice). Today, I came in to for 3 orders and rice is completely under cooked. I mean, crunch in between my teeth hard. The staff is always very friendly but good service can only take you so far. Being downtown, most customers are in on their lunch break. It's inconvenience of time and money when I need to find something else to eat. Hope management will take all of these review seriously and make the changes it needs to succeed.
