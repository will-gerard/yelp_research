Overall I would say Sugar Daddys is better than Sprinkles, the cupcake itself is very good. For me though, it is the frosting that really makes these cupcakes great! Couldn't get enough of the buttercreme. Even better, it's not a chain...gotta love that in AZ, the land of the chain.

Decided to give It another try. Last time I was here the food was okay but the service was bad. Well today was more of the same. My burger, the Mexi was okay but didn't at all remind me of "Mexican" food at all. Couldn't even taste a hint of chipotle aioli on it. That was the highlight. The sweet potato fries were burnt and the server was awful. It took forever to get our food and then for a side of ranch and refills on drinks. Others who ordered after us got their food first. Not sure how that happens. It wasn't busy either, just seems that they don't care about giving good customer service. Don't think I will be back anytime soon.

Great place, lots of flavors and toppings to choose from. The cake batter with circus animal cookies topping it off is awesome!

Authentic Italian pizza! The pizza is fantastic, the service very attentive and helpful and the desserts were amazing! Definitely recommend the semifreddo.

Absolutely love this place! I would not have known about it except for the article in azcentral about Pomo Pizzeria being one of the 10 best pizzas in the Valley. Looking at the website this morning, I saw the site for Forno as well. They are the only place in town to find a cornetto con crema like I had on my recent trip to Italy! This place is a true slice of Italy, walking in I immediately felt like I was back in Rome or Florence. The pizza is awesome, the selection great and the cornetto was perfect! I highly recommend Forno and if you have not had one before, get yourself a cornetto con crema, they are delicious!
