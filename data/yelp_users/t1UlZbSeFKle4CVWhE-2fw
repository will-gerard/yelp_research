I was really impressed with the quality of care we received at 1st Pet. They really treated our dog Cassie like she was the true member of our family that she is and made sure both of our needs were met during the visit. The doctor and assistants were extremely competent and detailed in their explanation of what was wrong and what our options were to treat it. I feel they found the perfect medium of professionalism and courtesy. I really appreciate all 1st Pet has done for us and will definitely recommend them to our friends and family. We waited 9 hours for our dog to be checked out at another emergency vet so the courtesy given to us at 1st Pet was much different.

If you've never gone here before, get here fast! This is my absolute favorite gelato place so I'm so happy that it's close to my dad's house. We go here almost every time I'm over. Their gelato is absolutely astounding, as is there coffee and canolis. Not to mention the attached Dolce Vita Grocer. Definitely visit there when you go for gelato!  I love this place because the gelato is amazing. Rich and flavorful. The people are so kind, too. They are some of the nicest people I've ever met. The owner is from Italy and speaks Italian. I mean, how much more authentic could it get?   Anyways, you've definitely got to go try this place out. Like, now.

Best gluten free buns ever. Honestly, if you're cutting it out for health reasons or just trying to eat well, check out the gluten free buns! They even do the fries in a separate fryer, which I appreciate.

You know, I really love the food here, but had the worst service ever tonight. I don't know if it was based on age, being a young adult, or out of pure laziness on the server'a behalf, but she never asked how our food was or if we wanted more bread. The only time she came over is when we had to call her over and then when she came over and said "do you want me to split the check?" And then put it on the table, without asking if we even wanted dessert. I mean, being the unruly teenagers we obviously are, we don't have money to spend on dessert.  I was honestly just appalled at the lack of service.

I really love this salon. I've came here before for a manicure and pedicure and loved it the first time, but the second time was just as great! They really care about attention to detail and delivering quality service. Plus, they've got lots of gel colors and new normal nail polish colors. And, they have the perfect O.P.I. taupe color too. Definitely try this place out.

I'm really sad that I had such a bad experience here. The waitress really lacked quality and was devoid of personality. She had a bad case of RBF. We ordered egg rolls which came out quickly, but were cold. They tasted fine, like freezer or Panda Express quality. The cook forgot to make our fried rice and then made it and it was delivered to our table. I ordered a 3 (on a 5 scale) and it was ridiculously hot. To the point that my mouth was burning and my chest was hurting a bit. I found it to be strange and thought I just got a bad bite, but it was all ridiculously hot and honestly just devoid of all flavor. I was not impressed. I give this place two stars because the fried banana at the other table did look quite good. The other waitress who helped us was very kind at least.  I feel like this place is incredibly hit or miss, unfortunately for us, we had a miss.

I actually really love this place; I don't know how you couldn't. The waiters we've had here are the sweetest and are very attentive. The second my tea was empty, it was promptly replenished. WITH a new lemon. Every time. The same went for out salad dishes; they were gone as soon as our salad was done!  Cory was seriously one of the best waiters we've ever had. He was kind, attentive and funny and we replay enjoyed his company as a waiter! He had the best timing; I was very impressed. I can honestly say I've never had such great service.  Regarding the food, for the money, it is a very great deal. It's cheaper than Olive Garden (which I now hate in comparison) and even includes spumoni.   We both started with salads. I love their vinaigrette and the fact that the bowls were cold. We also received some hot bread which was pretty standard.  For the actual entree, I had the manager's special with the marinara and the cheese and browned butter sauce (which were both pretty awesome) and my father had the chicken parmesan. He thought the chicken was good, but would have preferred it to be a little thiner, but he scarfed it down (and he is an italian food snob). Otherwise, I mean, come on.. They even have gluten free pasta! That's awesome! We also ordered a side of broccoli which was the perfect compliment to our meal.  We finished off with the spumoni (included) and it was the perfect end to a great meal!  I am very impressed with this place and will definitely be back!

Bless the establishments that gave gluten free options! Honestly. That is the #1 thing I look for in a place (being GF for allergy reasons) and it's great to know that one of my favorites offers gluten-free options!   And you've got to try the lavender lemonade. It's to die for.

We headed to Sunnyside for a Girls' Breakfast Out and had a great time. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and funny. He had a warmness about him that was very inviting and approachable; I really appreciated that! He seemed like he was really hustling for us. Anyways, one of my friends got a smoothie which she seemed to love. They make them with agave nectar, if I'm not mistaken, which is awesome. Makes you feel a little better than them using straight sugar.  My other friend and I both has the Denver omelette. While we both enjoyed it, I'd say it was only a little bit better than IHOP quality. But still pretty good! The potatoes were unfortunately a little dry, but still edible.   We used the Yelp deal where we got $20 for $12. I believe this added great value to our meal and definitely bumped up the star count.   My impression of the restaurant is a good one. I think they're still finding their voice, but the roots they have, like fresh squeezed juice, using agave nectar and infusing local cuisine. I'll definitely have to revisit them in the next couple of months and try something new.

Okay, I think I can finally write a review now that I've gone a billion times. I have struggled for years to find a nail salon that I can trust. Through yelp, I stumbled upon Marvel Nails, and can I say, thank god! Seriously the kindest, most talented people I've met! I love going in every time and leave oh-so happy. I get nothing but compliments on my amazing nails done by Tiffany. This is definitely something I've worked into my monthly budget because I love it so much. If you're on Yelp looking for an amazing nail place, look no further.

Had an absolutely wonderful experience here. The chicken pita wrap with salad and blackberry jasmine tea was amazing and the baklava was great, too! We live close by, so we'll definitely be coming more often. Very impressed! The service was also impeccable and you can tell they are very dedicated and enthusiastic about their business. We really enjoyed our experience.

This place is the bomb. I got the pesto cavatapi with a side salad and a drink and it was less than $10... How can you beat that? I really enjoyed my food. I'm definitely gonna try the Mac n cheese next time.  The small size was a great portion for me.

I really enjoyed my crepe here! We stumbled upon the place after dropping out pups off for boarding next door. The atmosphere is pleasant, the decor is beautiful and the food really was wonderful.

This is our favorite place to come, whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Their chips and salsa are a great way to start off the meal and their breakfast burritos are to die for. My favorite is the ham and egg burrito. Their tortillas are handmade and delicious as well; we like to bring them home! Oh! And if you like Coke Freestyle machines, they've got one!

I'm a long-time Salad and Go fan, so when I saw they were building one right around the corner from where I live, I was ecstatic! We have already been there two times since it has opened and have been incredibly impressed. Not only are the solids amazing, as expected, but the customer service is absolutely outstanding. I have never came upon such great employees in Mesa. I have no idea where they found these people, but they are seriously the best! Plus, how great is it to have a place that has salads and is set up like a drive through? It sure beats McDonald's.

Definitely one of my favorite Greek restaurants. They get two thumbs up for quality, value, friendliness and overall awesomeness! The portions you get are definitely worth how much you pay. The food itself is very delicious, I love the salad with the bell peppers and feta; too delicious! I usually get the chicken shawarma or a chicken kabob and love them both. The rice is super tasty too. Plus, their baklava is absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Their service is also something that stands out as they are genuine and kind. These are attributes I really appreciate.   So, definitely try this neighborhood Mediterranean grill. You won't be disappointed.
