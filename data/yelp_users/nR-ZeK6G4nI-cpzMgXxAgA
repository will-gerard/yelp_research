It looks like this place has a lot to offer, training, nutrition, smoothies. Today must have been an off day, unless this is just how business is conducted here, but I was never greeted, never acknowledged by the worker right in front of my face and felt completely overlooked. I understand there are other customers to be helped but a simple hello, I will be with you shortly would have sufficed.

Having travelled the high seas, near and far, east and west, I have yet to find a burger to satiate me the way the delux original does.   Thank goodness this place is still around since my college days or else I would be very sad visiting Phoenix. But why would this place go out of business, which we often have to worry about, even with the best places.   Now, the sauce that comes with the fries is also something I miss with a fierceness. I believe they told me the recipe once but I forget. Can anyone refresh my memory? Pretty please. Ok, that is all for now. Oh, and if you are ever in the South Bay in Los Angeles visit fathers office, it is quite similar. Ok back to eating. Bye.

Once again I went on my Scottsdale smoothie mission, today I stumbled upon the lovely buzz berry. Not only did they customise and perfect my order, they did it with a smile on their face and stimulating conversation. I would come back any morning, as I am curious about their breakfast burrito and bottomless mimosas.

Under very rare circumstances I visit Phoenix. However, if the weather isn't too unbearable, I thoroughly enjoy eating and drinking on the patio. I have been incredibly blessed continually having Athena as my server. Not only is she well versed in the food and drink items, she explains the dishes with such enthusiastic detail that my mouth is fervently awaiting the first bite. Luckily, the service is quite quick, even on a busy night. Dogs are allowed on the patio making the experience even more catered to my favorite things; cute animals, good food and drinks.

Today started off like any other day, I wondered what I was going to consume to get proper morning nutrition. As with the last 5 days I've been in phx, I decided on a smoothies. God forbid my host doesn't have a vitamix, so I have to drive to random locations to get my fix. As per usual, I got my smoothie from whole foods and was satiated, as well as perplexed as to why I just bought a ten dollar smoothie and why I also got $180 worth of random items including bee pollen and nut cheese? Anyways, I walked to my car and noticed the sign for pizzeria bianco. I loaded my whole two bags into the trunk and went and found out its the same place as the original location that I heard people bang on about the whole time I was at ASU. I got the margherita, recommended by the friendly and accommodating Dave. After my first slice I was pleased that the pizza was not only tasty but didn't leave me feeling sick as would a slice from somewhere like hungry Howies or dominos. Hurray pizzeria bianco, you continue to please.

Not knowing the area very well and missing my juice bar back in OC, I decided to give this this place another go. This time I ordered an apple based juice over ice with mint, lime, ginger and spinach. It was as lovely as it could possible be. I was talked into getting a cheeky spaghetti squash dish and was quite pleased with that as well. Also, never forget the homemade bars sold up front; you can never go wrong with these delightful bites.
