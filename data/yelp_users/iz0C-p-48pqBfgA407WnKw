Mexican places like this need to be judged based on consistency - here's what I mean:  42% of the time I've been hungover 30% of the time I've been drunk 22% of the time I've been sober 6%   of the time (other)  Food tastes great no matter what, and it's right down the street.

This is a legit establishment - they've got a good selection of everything and if they don't have something they'll usually figure out how to get it for you.  I bought my longboard here, I buy my Rainbow Sandals here, and I've bought Van's here; they even have Disc's for Disc Golf.

This review is only for the MTG side of the business.  Pop is great for buying boosters since they have a loyalty program, and it's fun talking shop.  I'm not crazy about their singles selection which seems somewhat disorganized, but it's the first place I started buying Magic cards when I got back into it a few years ago.  Everyone made me feel really welcome and gave me some great deck ideas.    I recommend everyone (card player or not) go there on a Friday after a set is released and just watch some of the madness going on - it's a total blast.

You forgot to put in my food order, or you forgot to apologize for the mistake, either way I haven't forgotten to write you a negative review.  If I could give 2.5 stars I would because the person next to me got their sushi on a boat which looked really cool, and deserves .5 stars.

Best place to listen to J-Pop in Scottsdale.

Best Tree Fort in Old Town, and you can take the mugs home if you get a moscow mule!

Where's the Organic section?  Where's the Fresh Mozzarella floating in water?  I wanted to make Caprese, but their artisan meats and cheeses were lacking.  After checkout, I bought 5 scratchers and didn't win anything!

Back in the day I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16.  After Beggar's Canyon me and my buddies would usually stop by this place for a cold one.    Happy hour goes till 7 - the Juri Juice is only 3 credits.  A lot of people complain about service, but Wuher, the bartender, is hard of hearing so you might have to tug on his sleeve to get a drink.  I don't know what Nick R's issue is with this spot - it's a dive bar, bro.  If you want a club scene - go to Alderaan, I hear it's blowing up...

This is hands down the best bike shop in the neighborhood.  They help out all levels of bikers, and have something for everyone from beach cruisers to the higher performance mountain bikes and road bikes.  I bought my current bike here, and always bring it to them if I need work done.  They're knowledgable, honest, and affordable.  The new location is great, it's kinda cool that it's right on the canal, and more accessible I think.
