Dr Shayna Mansfield has been my primary care physician since I moved to the valley. She has been outstanding as a doctor and very thorough in her approach with your health. During several visits she asked me a multitude of questions, as well as allowed me to be very open about what was going on. She even said at one point "I don't know, how do you feel you would like to go about it?". Humility is amazing, and I am grateful I can have a conversation with her rather than being steamrolled like most other doctors who carry the "treat 'em and street 'em" mentality.   As for he office, there was a little confusion with co pays with the office staff but no big deal. Bear in mind they are transitioning to emr so there is a little lag. They accept blue cross/ blue shield so most things are covered. Waiting room is clean, updated magazines fill most end tables. Parking is easy (I always get lucky with a front row spot).   If you are looking for a great doctor, then you should defiantly trust dr Mansfield to give you the care you deserve.

Right off the bat, week nights between 7 and 8 are the best time to go; not crowded at all.   This is what a shooting range should be for someone that doesn't have land to shoot on: range, gun smith, small shop, and a few to rent. You are treated like you are competent by both staff and range masters, and range fees are affordable. If it isn't crowded, it is a great place to shoot. When it is crowded it does get stuffy and hot but such is the nature of an indoor range.   Some of these one star reviews are unreadable, and make me say "lol what?". Different strokes for different folks, but if you are someone who wants to be hand held through he experience then this isn't the place for you. It's generally straightforward; the same person that complains about "well in my day there was customer service!!!!!" Is the same type of shooter who starts off every sentence in the range with "well glock is a plastic gun and not a 1911 so hur dur". Scottadale gun club is a drive from anywhere in the east valley and pricey, and C2 is down right dangerous with how they let their range master do what ever the hell it is they do. Shoot here, you won't be disappointed if ou are coming to shoot.

Go to place for Chinese on a week night.    Great fried wontons with crab and cream cheese, general tso chicken, and broccoli beef.   Best part is a drive thru; though this is not pioneering for food, it is awesome for those that want to skip over the Panda Express thunder poops.

This store has everything you could ever want and even more; yes there are unusual items along with regular fair. The smell can be off putting but is part of the charm.   If you can't find something you like here, you are doing it wrong.

Initially quite skeptical, and fearing another notch on the link of trendy family owned restaurants that disappoint, I found this to be the best meal I have had in a long time.   Environment was very pleasing, with bright colors, easy to navigate, and appropriate noise level. Listening to "looking out my back door" by ccr was a plus one.   Onto the main course: I had the prickly pear chicken sandwich with a side of green chili Mac and cheese.   Sammich: I will stop short of calling this the best sandwich ever created, but will say it is the sandwich that has everything you have ever needed. The chicken is slightly opaque and vibrantly pink in color (poached? Baked?) with a subtle sweet and sour flavor and a unique tang I can only think to be the flavor of prickly pear. This, coupled with a slightly spicy yet creamy green chili spread was the perfect balance of sweet, sour, heat, and salty. Topped with well shredded lettuce that was enough to play on cold and hot (and not too much that the sandwich imploded on it self like a collapsing star), made this sandwich second to none.   *quick note in the baguette, hands down the best I have had. Most French baguettes used for sandwich are hard and crusty for an overbearing amount of flaky texture that it just feels like biting into a giangtic non sugary piece of captain crunch that destroys the roof of your mouth. This, however, is incredibly soft in the middle and lends itself well to the filling. With a crunchy and cheery crust that makes it incredible.   Mac and cheese: I am typically a purist for Mac and cheese and don't like any additional inherited (from the school of thought of "stopped putting tomatoes, broccoli, or chicken on Mac and cheese, it isn't meant to be healthy"). This however was perfectly cooked pasta, lightly dressed in a spicy green chili cheese sauce. Could eat this forever.     As far as price, it isn't that expensive. We walked out for 20 on a Friday night. Yelpers that don't have cash, don't go out. This place is well worth twice the price.

As far as car washes goes, it is nice that they have out door seating and a coffee shop inside. Other than that, I was largely uncomfortable with the employees and service of the wash.   Service: I expect up selling as a person who was in sales, and I expect the questions and requests to upgrade no matter what package you pick. I picked the 19.99 package, the guy who was helping me politely asked if I would like to up grade. I declined and thought that would be it. No big deal. Less than 5 feet from my car, I get spotted and swooped on by another employee about a crack in my windshield. Before I even replied I his "hello" I got an entire speech about fixing it, dangerous to drive, and insurance would cover it.   I said "I am fine today man thanks" in hopes if could leave that awkward situation and read my book on peace. Entering the building another employee (another windshield guy) chases me down to ask why I didn't set an appointment to get it replaced. I responded that I didn't want to and my insurance wouldn't cover the cost. He then asked to see my insurance card, and handed me his business card in hopes of making a sale. I don't know what the deal is here, but this is more aggressive than a used car salesman and a door to door salesman combined. My insurance policy is none of any ones business, much less someone that runs through a car wash trying to talk me into stuff. I really that I wasn't handed a card that I would promptly throw away   On too of all that nonsense, car still had spots on all the windows, and there was parts of the interior that were not cleaned out and still had dirt in them.   I was in a pinch and needed a wash, but given the choice I will wash my own car knowing it will be done right and that I won't be hit up 3 different times for service I don't need. No means no car wash. Leave me be, I am already giving you money.   Anyone know of a car wash that does a better job that won't track and shake you down at every turn? Pictures to follow on the poor quality of work.

On the quest for the perfect hot dog, ted's fell well short of being....well, good.   Getting straight to the food: hotdogs were run of the run, and largely flavorless; mine was topped with canned/boxed agent orange Mac and cheese. Also go onion rings that were near Impossible to eat due to thin cuts, oiled out crust, and lack of seasoning.   I imagine this place is great if you are drunk, but not anything to go out of your way for.

This far this has been a two star experience; had to negotiate a time to do an estimate since it was made clear they won't come up outside of 8 am to 330 pm.   I sent an inquiry online through yelp, and was called within a few hours. Upon getting on the phone I was informed that estimates were only given between 8 am and 430 pm, Monday they Friday. This made it quiet inconvenient for me to arrange a time during working hours when I have an hour commute. I got the guy on the phone to commit to having someone at my door at 8 am on Friday (I had arranged this on Tuesday).   Friday comes around, 8 am. 8:05. 8:10. Get a call that says "I will be there in 15 to 20"; now I am sure this company does good work based off reviews and pictures, but arranging to call 15 minutes after an agreed meeting time doesn't spell out customer service. Maybe the attitude changes after money has exchanged hands, but certainly puts a sour outlook on me picking an electrician in a multiple bid situation.   Electro an shows up for the bid at 8:30 and is quite friendly. He comes in, I explain what I am looking for. He takes a few pictures of the area where the work will be done, then says we will get you an estimate ASAP. I am not sure why I couldn't take the very same pictures of my ceiling and send them in without arguing on the phone to arrange a time (that wasn't met), but I digress.   Another frustrating factor was getting an email at 430 pm on Friday afternoon stating my estimate wouldn't be ready until Monday. For a minor situation, this seems like a ton of run around, disorganization, and disregard for time. Low and behold the estimate is over 600 dollars to just install lights while cutting into drywall and not repairing it. Why would I pay someone to tear into the roof and then not repair it? The entire point of having a professional do it is so they would be able to run the electrical lines through the structure.   I wouldn't recommend using this company based on the negative experience just  getting a damn estimate a week after.

This is really what a oil change station should be; fast and efficient with not annoying hard sell for bs services.   Change was done with full synthetic is less than 10 minutes; topped off all fluids and was in and out in less than 20. Prices seemed on par but just better service and much faster.

Really nothing but issues since my girlfriend purchased her rogue here. May not be overt in their used car sales tactics, but being charming about it doesn't make their bullshit anymore palatable.  First red flag should have been when we attempted to trade in a car and were told it would be worth 1200 in trade in value. Turns out when stuff was actually put on paper, we got a typical "well not quite that high.......", and then we're told that they would trade it in for less than half. I get they are trying to make a buck on a used car, but to justify it by saying "oh well we have to take it to auction and sell it and that costs is money".....what makes them think I give two shits what they do with a car that is no longer mine? If you say you will do something at a certain price, then do it. If not, keep your meat flap shut.   On too of this, there is no negotiation in price. At all. Every car I have purchased, even from the seedy dealers, has waste the documentation fee (bullshit for them to charge for filing the paperwork on the car you are buying from them. Some what akin to charging a conscience fee when buying something you were already buying). Again, the justification is "everyone pays that, if we gave it to you free we would have to give it to everyone free". Again, horse shit; I had been considering buying a truck from here until I heard this identify with the crowd and appeal to normalcy Daniel pink sales nonsense.   Upon having the car, oil changes takes a really long time. To top things off, this model of rogue had transmission issues (a factory defect) that we were assured were fixed. Low and behold, driving to California one day we notice the car will not change out of 3rd gear and won't go above 60. Called these clowns and asked for a service report on the transmission (fixes and flushes) before and after our purchase date. Nothing was done to the car, nor were we informed we needed a flush after 30000 miles. Luckily, we made it to ca and took it to a nissan dealer that informed us it was still under warranty. That's right, the actual dealer was better customer service than these people. When we noted this to  them, the only thing that was said "well we can discuss that if you come in". Ha.... You got jokes.   Avoid at all cost; the sales schtick is still there but because they wear t shirts and don't negotiate, people believe that they are getting a decent experience. Given the opportunity, there will be issues with your purchase during and after sale. Stay away.

This is in a different part of Guadalupe and was excited to try it.   Empty on a Friday night but the service Ed very prompt and our waitress very nice. She brought chips and salsa and took our order back.   Chips had a stale and almost plastic flavor to them; salsa was not spicy nor did it taste like much. Left most of it untouched despite being pretty hungry.   My main course was the shrimp Veracruz with flour tortillas, sever with beans, white rice, and an iceberg salad. Oddly enough, the very English looking white rice (which included carrots and peas), was the best tasting. The peppers carrots and olives of the Veracruz was swimming in sauté sauce and oil so it was mostly a mess. The iceberg lettuce had tasted like it had soured.   Over all, not a good meal in a not great part of town for more than it was worth.

I wish I would have known about this place while I lived in phx. Great small bar with a modern locals I like type of feel. Very nondescript building off Indian school; if you are there are a cooler winter night I suggest one of their hand crafted cocktails. The brandy Alexander I had was fantastic, almost like a chilled adult hot chocolate served in a classy martini glass.   We got there on the earlier side prior to meeting friends so we found a spot in the back of the building to park; if you come past 10 pm the parking be is a tad tight and you may have to walk some.   Also, don't show up in a tank top and hoodie.....the bouncer didn't seem to like one that showed up directly from the gym. But he was also drunk off his ass.

Healthiest drive through option ever. They actually cook! I am at the Scottsdale location at least once a week. As a creature of habit, I generally only order the same thing....the seasonal turkey sandwich called "the gobbler" with this amazing cranberry goat cheese spread. Not sure what I will do when they change the menu.   They have assorted iced teas as well: green, black, and cactus pear or cactus blossom. These are excellent when mixed with black tea. The last time I went thru, I noticed they had a "doggie bag" option, which is chicken and wild rice. That's an awesome option for anyone who takes their pet anywhere.  Additionally, this place is small.... But if the drive through is backed up, the guy that works the first window will come out with spare menus and take your order on the spot. I don't think I have ever waited more than 5 min for food.

As it is my first one star review, I will begin with this positive. The "skeleton" of this place is pretty good. Decent size, aisle are wide, and I can find pretty much anything on my list that isn't highly specialized. Located anywhere else, it would be an alright place to shop. Prices seem pretty on par. However, this store is the reason that gf and I avoid any place within a block of the light rail on camelback.   Many other reviews will mention this, but I do believe it needs to pointed out. This store is just not safe, especially after dark. I have come to this store late (as my only alternative is to head west of i17 for groceries) to be hit up for money. One meth head (I assume meth because of the burnt urine smell she gave off), snuck up on me in the parking lot at 11pm to ask me to sign a petition for some cause. While most of the people here I am sure mean no harm, I would prefer not to be the person in front of them when they snap or start hearing voices. While there is always one security guard on duty, it probably wouldn't be effective if rival baby mamas or homeless druggies decided it was a good idea to brawl.   However, this shouldn't be surprising. This is what happens when public transportation is built. It gives undesirable people cheap access to other neighborhoods. While I try my hardest not to go here, there are times when I have to. Never go in here unarmed....while god forbid you'd ever have to use it, an open carried weapon serves as a warning for those who make bad ideas a life priority.

Beyond being the best philly cheese steak I have had and being run by an incredible family, I had to share one of the most outstanding displays of customer service that I have ever seen. Found myself asking "is this real life?"  There I was stuffing an amazingly soft and tasty cheesesteak (with onions and sauce) when random patron two tables down derp dropped his sammich on the floor. One of the daughters of the owner (I never got her name) swooped in and said "did you drop it?".....patron looked up in shame and said yeah.   Best part is within thirty seconds and upon utter insistence he had a new one made at no cost. Patron delivered with an extra large tip. I didn't know places were this caring or on too of it....seriously, this is the customer service and care that grandparents reminisce about.   Keep it up ladies! You are have become a staple on chandler with your excellent food and even better genuine care for everyone who sets foot in your place. One of your daughters told me you all moved from out of state to start a new beginning here.....I hope to be a proud customer for years to come!!!!!

Another reviewer mentioned that it was a neighborhood grocery that fit the neighborhood....that is one way to describe it.   Store is older, and run down. Only one entrance and the parking lot (and locals) are insane. Always an issue with someone flipping you off or shouting random stuff at you while driving through parking lot. Made he mistake of leaving my car unlocked and came back to some random person opening my door. While this isn't the frys on camelback that is outright dangerous, this chain seems to know how to attract he people your parents warned you about. Desperately need armed security in this store and parking lot    This frys came to be know as the frys that we don't go to, opting for the one on Warner instead if we are desperate for something.

Starting this off, I am no doctor. The closest I have is a live in nurse girlfriend; when I go to the doctor, I tend to be in a bad way and it's because I need medical care I can't come across on my own.   I presented symptoms of what I thought to be an upper respiratory infection: facial pain, chills, low grade fever, aching throat, chest pain and wheezing while breathing. Went into this place and was seen within 40 minutes, and presented all of these symptoms to a doctor in residency. Was given an in office treatment of albuterol  via a nebulizer after a series of absurd questions regarding symptoms I didn't have. Bear in mind this was from the supervising doctor and not the doctor in residency, who actually attempted an examination.   Doc: "do you have asthma?"  Me: "no" Doc: "are you sure?" Me: "still no"  After that treatment, which I admittedly didn't well to, I was asked about some other symptoms. At this point I wanted antibiotics, as this is usually what is prescribed for my frequent upper respiratory infections  Doc: "are you coughing?"  Me: "no" Doc: "we're going to give you some prescription cough suppressant"  Me: "I don't have a cough; can I have some amoxicillin? That's usually what I get prescribed"  Doc, clearly annoyed: "yeah sure but take the cough medicine".   Get to the pharmacy; low and behold, no antibiotics have been prescribed. This is day 6 with no symptom relief and nothing but cough suppressants for a cough I didn't have and continue not to have; turns out I have a sinus infections that can only be cured with....wait for it....amoxicillin! Jesus jet fuel Christ, if I had a broken rib would I be given medication for heart burn? Or if I had appendicitis, would you send me on my way with Advil and some juice?    Medicine should not be dictated on narrowed views of how medicine should be administered and gut feelings.   I would not recommend this place, not because of waits, over charging, or any other of the complaints on Yelp; don't go here if you want care for the illness you have. My care was a series of random guesses based on symptoms I never presented (I still don't have asthma). I somewhat get the aversion to prescribing antibiotics , especially during flu season, but they were developed for a reason. To help you body get past an illness. If a medical professional won't help get you past your illness for what ever reason, then they have ceased being useful to you.

An outstanding meat market with the absolute best steaks and bacon, all butchered fresh on site.   They also carry different hard woods for smoking, and pellets for electric grills. That combined with the great local beer and wine, fresh or frozen cheese curds, and a variety of more exotic meats is a fantastic addition and out of your way trip to get quality meat. Skip winco, skip frys, this is the place you want to get your meat.   If they read this, I request more game meats!

Stieners is everything a pub should be in Vegas!   Situated just south of over priced drinks, spray tans, and hundreds of call girl cards on the street sits this 24 hour spot, ready to serve all of what you are looking for in drink menus and pub fare.   Three things yelp friends:   1. Hands down the best chili I have ever had. Nabbed some off the old mans plate of a chili burger. Sweet, tomato tang and full beef flavor. One of those true staple foods way too god like to describe.   2. On bone lamb chops; I am used to Vegas buffets and churn n burn eateries throwing out "high end fair" for sub par prices and it is typically get what you pay for. This is different; under 12 bucks for 6 small lamb chops grilled extra rare and served with horse radish. Stop reading and order these. Seriously. Call ahead and order them.   3 horse radish sauce; the king of sauces as far as I see it. Beautiful in in balance of a brine and slight heart but no where near over powering. Perfectly seasoned for those aforementioned rare lamb chops. Even my heat and horse radish phobic girlfriend celebrated this.   Uber past all the strip and find this place; worth while any time of day.

Can I just plus one for a places already adored by yelp?   For a perfect winter day in az, this is the perfect out door place. I had several things on he menu because it was fat day.   Two hot dog combo: Sonora dog and BBQ dog.   Sonora was excellent, though mine didn't come with bacon. Baked camp beans piled high on kosher beef with cheese and jalapeños. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and an especially good lobster role fried to perfection. Second was a pulled pork: exactly as it sounds. Pork was a tad dried out, but not big deal.   The day we went, they were running Super Bowl specials. Seattle special (go hawks) was a seared salmon sandwich. This is the first place we had salmon that was 1. Pacific and 2. Not cooked to oblivion leaving behind gum textured fish swimming in its own oil. Absolutely fantastic.   Lastly, there was a shake with ground up chocolate covered espresso beans. Best shake I have had.   Again, go hawks. I could think of a no more annoying fan base than Bostonians drowning on about the "pah-trah-aits".

Several times here, several times awful.   I will put almost any type of exotic food on my plate. Tried a seasonal kangaroo burger; essentially tasted like rancid meat atop of piles brioche bun. It was bad to the point I actually had to spit it out and not finish a small burger.  Second disaster was an oyster po boy slider.  Same greases brioche, couple with two oysters that were deep fried and joined with raw batter that had soaked up a waiter cup of grease.   To add to that, this place is always a victim of the great Scottsdale salt shortage. Nothing was seasoned to the point that it should be criminal.   Great ideas and sentiment, but awful execution.

I have to agree on certain terms with Anthony p. This place has everything that I could need on a night time grocery run, which is usually frozen pizza and toaster strudels. I have done a normal grocery run here and it's pretty much just full of old people. It's still cheaper than trader joes and Safeway.   More over, I don't really give any considerations to supporting a local business or not, as long as it is a good experience with quality goods. It is generally the same as the frys up 7th, but a whole lot less rapey. Cleaner and less drugged out clientele......I don't actually need to carry a gun to shop here.

Mix and match tacos!   Pleasant ambiance for the most part, not a gaudy cantina knock off. Tip when ordering drinks: ask for the green salsa with the complement chips. Rich and smokey and tons better than red.  Tacos are pretty good, especially the steak which was actually grilled/seared rare!

4 million stars!  Well priced, extremely fast, and amazingly delicious food. This has been the saving grace of sick days and busy weeknights were my lovely wifey turns into a food rage monster can only be satiated by a tasty firestorm of pho. Here's looking at your sav r ;) if you don't like pho, it is because you have a problem with yourself   Remember, if you over do it with the sriacha.....it is my divine intervention. The furry of the chile gods is testing you to become a stronger person. Persevere. Stay strong.

Had a total shit day and needed to get out of the house. Even if everything had been average or terrible, the brunette girl that works the front is very nice and she was enthusiastic about everything. To the owner: she is awesome, make sure she sticks around.   I had been to urban beans a few times, but mostly for their eclectic wine selection (they have a bunch of good Washington state wines which are a little tough to find). Today was the first time I ate here. Iced tea and turkey and Brie sand which.... Well seasoned and came with an uber yummy side salad. I took the two top piece if bread off but that is just a personal preference.   I would like to add that this is the best time of year to use their outdoor seating (feb thru may). It is gorgeous out and even better when coupled with their excellent device and good food.

I can be a pretty demanding customer., especially with the stress of buying a new house coupled with a new job in the same week. Nick helped to make things a little less stressful.   I called him on a Tuesday to do a difficult ceiling fan install on 14 ft high vaulted ceilings. He was there Wednesday afternoon and did everything that was required to get it done. Whoever build my house/did the wiring did a half assed job that rivaled DMV customer service. Nick worked under the light if a headlamp, cut into drywall, went to a hardware store, rewired the entire system, and then installed the second one. He was there for over 4 hours and kept us informed the whole way through. He stayed over 4 hours, until the job was completed.   After that we had a conversation with him where he have us insider knowledge on what plumbers charge (ever heard of a trip charge? That's where you pay some clown to come out to tell you he can't fix something). I will be using nick for this home and every other property I own. He even charged us less than quoted and wouldn't take my cash when I tried to pay extra. I'll have to find a way to sneak it in to payment for other jobs!

The smells coming out of here are great; overall it was a good experience albeit it for a bittersweet goodbye dinner to friends.   We started with the tikka fries; while I wouldn't choose them over chili cheese fries they are a nice change if pace. I was also amazed at how the fries stayed crispy while being slathered in sauce.   I had the goat haleem, purely out of curiosity and a desire to try the most widely consumed meat in the wold. It is a type of lentil and goat puréed soup served rice. While it was delicious, I would have preferred more actual meat as opposed to the few pieces I got.   Naan was also good but I don't know that I have ever had bad naan.

The smells in this place are amazing. This has become the go to place that resembles a somewhat healthier option than my pizza and Chinese take out addiction. I will defiantly want to hit this place up before any event at chase field or if the suns are ever decent enough to see.   My first visit I did an sweet and sour chicken with a side of rice. Huge portion that last most of dinner and most of lunch the next day. Next time was loosing my pad Thai virginity. Now I didn't study abroad for 6 weeks in some god awful green peace program on Thailand...so I am not an authority on if this is "authentic".....but honestly, if you are hungry and like tasty goodness then this place will make you happy. So drop the cartel coffee and your thrift store copy of "animal farm" and just eat.   Additionally, the main waitress has remembers when we come in and insists we sit at "our table". Cute as hell.

Not as bad as the location in old town, but still not worth it.   Pretty simple order took over half an hour to be brought to table. Had the prime dip with chips. Meat was good, role was good, cheese was plastic tasting.   Seasoning always seems to be way off here: had the chips that were pretty much oil and thin potato....absolutely no salt on it. However, au jus for sandwich was beyond salty, almost to the point of inedible.   If you were forced to eat here like I was, check in to get a 5 dollar coupon. Will make it a little easier to deal with.

Decent lunch place after fan fest at chase.   Seated promptly after most things on down town were closed after 2 pm on a Sunday. Decided on a fig and proscuto piZza. While I had wished the prosciutto was fried and crispy on top, it didn't disappoint. I intended on eating half and proceeded to eating the whole pie.  Girlfriend had a balsamic salad with chicken. While the greens were crisp and well seasoned croutons were the best I have had, the chicken breast was cooked into submission and came out with a mealy dry texture.   Dani was our waitress; she was prompt and not overly chatty or interrupting ever 3rd sentence while we were enjoying our conversation. Not sure what customer service issues other yelp people have had, but ours was very pleasing.

Incredible food. See pictures for their stuffed French toast (they even put the real maple syrup on the side, for those that can't anything too sweet). Bacon is equally delicious and they make monster omelettes with various ingredients. Girlfriend had a southwestern omelette with lots of fresh avocado that she raved about. I found the coffee to be particularly good as well, one of the few non coffee shops you can actual drink the coffee black.  The atmosphere is nicer too, eclectically decorated with a picture of the restaurant's name sake dog on the front counter. It is also reasonably quiet for a brunch place. Pending a large party doesn't sit next to you, you can have great conversations.  More over, what moved me to rate this place so highly was the service of our waitress Bethany. For one, anyone who notices that I and girlfriend are wearing doctor who t shirts automatically gets 50 points on the nerd fighter scale. More over, she is genially interested in her conversation with you, and has nothing but nice things to say. In my new hometown that seems to be notorious for subpar service, Bethany was a breath of fresh air....and the reason why I have made wy-not my permanent breakfast spot in central Phoenix.

This is an obscure gas station, BBQ joint, wine bar, bakery, vintage store, and car wash. Whew!   Food is some of the best of its kind I have had; the Mac and cheese was done really simply. No tomatoes, chicken, jalapeños, truffle oil, bacon on bacon, or anything else that a chef could dream up. Simply, clean, suprisingly light and not over bearing in its flavor. I assume white cheddar and some type of sheets milk white on perfectly cooked pasta. Also indulged in a fruit tart with some of the freshest fri to have tasted at a rest in Arizona. So do yourself a favor, drop the old town scottsdale foodie scene and come up and explore what this place has to offer.      Gas tends to be more expensive than other place, but I imagine the premium is for the north scottsdale location.   I will be annoying and make this one complaint. This place gets overly crowded even at half capacity. Outside is fine, but while inside you have to meander between tight space of country chic decor being sold and the main lunch counter. Tables are extremely close together and there are an in ordinate amount of bussers (I am counting 6 for a place that has less then 8 people in it now). It can be tough to  navigate between so many bussers, the manager, people paying for gas, and all the patrons. Two people almost collided three times right behind me.

Been  sitting here for 40 min for a bowl of udon and one sushi role. Coupled with the fact that this place is tough to find or see from mayo...  Food finally got there. Udon was ok but roll had sauce that was just straight mayonnaise. Not quick, not cheap, and more trouble than it's worth   Cleaning chemical on hosted stand while I waited was nice to look at

Over a thirty minute wait, no misters, and very very limited seating? Also can't call ahead orders?   No lol. Not worth it for okay food. Exclusivity chic is lost on this place.

Outstanding watch service; brought in 5 to start with. They did the first battery as complementary and were able to finish the rest within a day's. No more of this going to a jeweler and paying 35 bucks to change a battery on a 100 dollar watch.   If you are into coins this is your place too. Very happy and the only place I will go now

Food is most defiantly tied to memories of home but the negative reviews of this place out silly.   This place is in Las Vegas. On Fremont no less; getting upset that these hotdogs and fries are not up to an idealized standard is like being pissed that the Paris doesn't have the tip top bistro and cafe you remember when you drunkenly back packed through Europe. Do you refuse to set foot in Caesars because the busts of Roman emperors appears out of chronological order? Vegas has made a name for itself in cheap accessible entertainment and food that appeals to the masses. And is damn good.   As far as chili dogs and fries go, this place won't disappoint. Basic fair that is done really well and served in less than 40 seconds. Stumble in, inhale everything in site, contemplate how you will work of the food crimes you committed, and continue the party.   Eat here. Stop reading, eat here.

My girlfriend was recently in the market for her first firearm. After searching online and hitting up two shops (bass pro and c2), we called and asked the guys here if they had the specific pistol she was looking for (sig 380, model is escaping me).   From our first call, Healy was respectful and extremely helpful. I had her select the gun she wanted and felt comfortable with, and tried to give little input so that she would make the decision based on what she wanted. She asked questions which were always answered in great detail. Before any money exchanged hands, they were showing her how to field strip and clean the gun.   While getting her squared away with her background check and transaction (which took all of 20 min), I had asked one of the marks about an ar 15 build I wanted to complete. Admittedly I was pretty ignorant on parts for final assembly, but was show how to assemble the lower parts kit in store. I purchased the trigger assembly a few days later and realized I had forgotten about the pistol grip and other key features. I was able to come back, humble in my ignorance, they allowed me to return the parts and buy a lower assembly kit with no fuss. This away refreshing, especially since a ton of the tacti-cool shops in az have a "do you ever at-15, bro?!?" Attitude.   Any gun I purchase will be done here, and I hope the new location in Tempe is prosperous. Keep it up guys!

Loving this place since I moved to the are, even though I always mistakenly pronounce the name "tableau".   The dive through is always very fast; girls that work here really love when murph (my boxer) sits in front seat with me so hey can pet her while drinks are made. They also have dog treats and water bowls for your four legged friends

A solid three star gym, as it is nothing special but it does share a parking lot with frys and 3 check cashing places. While issues within the gym are just normal annoyances such as waiting for machines, stepping foot outside (especially at night) is tricky. Solid chance that you may get robbed, stuck with a needle, or run over. General rule of thumb for new Phoenix yelpers......if at all possible, avoid anything within a block of the light rail on camelback and/19th.

Came by on suggestion of a friend, and didn't ever find a need to come back.   Quesadilla was cold, beer was run of the mill. I'm not into fixies so the decor appeal wasn't there; in addition, service was slow. Another place where food could have been made way better at home.    Not sure what the tempsters see in this place?

Alright event to attend. Got some free passes to a box on the 16th hole.   Apparently there is a group that puts this on called the thunderbirds....who dress EXACTLY like what I imagine golfers look like....ridiculous pants, and lots of visors.   Cool part was that we went on the celebrity tournament day, so I got to see two childhood Heros play. Randy Johnson and ken Griffey jr! See pictures for more.   Tiger woods also lead a good of celebrities.....it was odd to see how stark quiet it got when we put a foot out on the grass. It was like god had stepped forth and whisper "silence!" As a commandment and everyone followed suit.   All in all, if you have free passes with catered food and free drinks, go for it. It is probably not worth wading through drunken 30k millionaires on a Saturday afternoon

Ska and pastry on Saturday morning!   Found this place on yelp while debating the merits of getting out of bed. Needless to say, making the choice to come here will make it worth it.   While it is tucked a way in a small corner, it is easily accessible from the ray and alma school intersection. Upon arriving, we were greeted and given the run down on different option. Guy working there was really nice and made great recommendations. We went Jamaican beef, ham and egg, and chocolate creme.  Will now be a regular place!

Sorry to say this just isn't the best place to go despite outstanding facilities.   Large pro shop, many lanes, semi easy location to get to but the value for dollar and people you need to deal with are not there.   The range "masters" are toe a line between black water reject and call of duty fan boy. In every way they speak or interact with you (and your weapons) you will feel like you are treated like an inept child who has only seen guns in movies. Want to preach range safety? Sure. Wanna inspect my rifles to make sure the action is clear? Yeah I guess. Won't let me holster my weapon on the wrong side of the yellow line? Your house your rules.   But several things bothered me when those charged with range safety were actor out. One guy was so bored that he took his "tacti-cool" knife out of his billet proof vest  and started flicking the blade in and out of closure while not looking down range. Why in he hell are you carrying a side arm in a quick release and have a vest on? See a lot of combat in Tempe?   A second one had a pistol (not holstered" stuffed in the waist band of his jeans, where one small movement could get your ding dong shot off. While clowns like this usually show up at gun ranges looking like they desperately hope to fight zombies in Afghanistan, that type of ridiculous behavior is usually reserved for shooters and not employees. Bad form on a range that employs the very people that safety courses warm you about.    Pro shop is also over priced to the tune of double digit percentage points. Wanted to look at a sig for my lady and it turned out to be 400 dollars over what any other store had them listed at. Also went in looking for several accessories and parts only to learn "oh we are out" or "we can order them".   Is this a place to rent a gun on a weekend or to go for a bachelorette party? Yes. It is not the place to go if you wish to be respect as a competent adult around the call of duty crowd, nor a place that is very affordable. After 4 trips, each more negative than the last, i don't think I need to go back again.

Finally a good micro brew and restaurant in Arizona! And ten min away from my house.   Their beer this far is excellent. The pale ales and IPA are not typical of most micros (in that places like san tan and four peaks hop the shit out of everything and say "teehee see we can be just like stone!").   The food has always been good, burgers that are actually done rare and fries cooked up in duck fat.     Real thought is put behind all of their food and beer: if there is something local that is good, they will find a way to use it. I don't not remember of the porter or stout uses local superstition coffee, but it will be worth a visit.   Oh, and plus one for the growler station. Always glad to see a place to get fresh beer in large quantities

I can be a pretty demanding customer., especially with the stress of buying a new house coupled with a new job in the same week. Dave helped to make things a little less stressful.   I called him on a Tuesday to do a difficult ceiling fan install on 14 ft high vaulted ceilings. He was there Wednesday afternoon and did everything that was required to get it done. Whoever build my house/did the wiring did a half assed job that rivaled DMV customer service. Dave worked under the light if a headlamp, cut into drywall, went to a hardware store, rewired the entire system, and then installed the second one. He was there for over 4 hours and kept us informed the whole way through. He stayed over 4 hours, until the job was completed.   After that we had a conversation with him where he have us insider knowledge on what plumbers charge (ever heard of a trip charge? That's where you pay some clown to come out to tell you he can't fix something). I will be using nick for this home and every other property I own. He even charged us less than quoted and wouldn't take my cash when I tried to pay extra. I'll have to find a way to sneak it in to payment for other jobs!

Spring training headquarters? Not when the gear you supply is on 4 of the teams that train here. No mariners, Indians, reds, padres, brewers,  rangers, white sox, or Rockies. Shouldn't be taking ads out in the new times spring training guides that say you supply all the teams gear when....well, you don't.   Prices are not the 50 percent off as promised, pretty on par with spring training sights

Glad to be review number 400 for this place; straight out a noir graphic novel, I finely lit prohibition watering hole that makes you glad the 21st amendment was repealed.   Went in for a friends Feelin' 22 bday bash and were very surprised at this bar tucked away in the corner of an Art Deco building; hand crafted cocktails (beyond creamy White Russians) and small plates make it my new favorite fancy ass place in downtown.

I had he misfortune of living in the Bay Area for 6 years. Ike's at Stanford was one of the only good things about it.   From what I understand, Ike's has developed thousands of sand which combinations over the years. My personal favorites are the Damon Bruce and the Reggie Jackson (you'll notice that the sandwiches are typically named after someone, lots of sf giants players on the menu).   This place just opened in an odd corner of Mesa on valentines day. The best thing about it is there was no line and no San Francisco people that you had to deal with in order to get a great sandwich.

Quick and cheap but not without the third degree.   I'm usually a middle of the road wash person, but the two times I have been here there is always some 18 year old one direction looking guy jamming his done inside my car trying to get to to get a monthly pass. Even worse, my girlfriend stopped here between patients to get a car wash and one of these clowns decided that talking her up and giving her his number while she was in a big rush. Can't discredit him for trying to get at a good looking lady and going way above his stage, but time and place my friend. A frantic rushed woman who just wants a car wash won't call you back.   Oh, both of the vaccum so used had their plastic parts fall off. I really should learn to just wash my car at home

Craving Japanese style noodle soup since I was feeling poorly, found this place in the north reaches of scottsdale.   Service was prompt; drink was a delicious non sweet green iced tea. Ordered tempura udon and a Philly role to try out sushi. Sushi is pretty basic but good, hard to screw up salmon cream cheese and cucumber.   Star of show was udon; initially surprised by a smaller portion sizes served in small pot but it was perfect! There were not so many noodles that it made it hard to eat, and the vegetables were fresh as well. The broth was lighter, slightly oily and had a rich background of savory and heat. Noodles appeared to be home made to. They warned me it took 20 minutes to make but was in table in less than 10. God lunch spot if you work in the area, or looking for lighter fare in the summer

Everything should be on waffles. Everything.   Stumbled across this place after a gun show at westgate; was the only place not packed and forcing people to sit outside. Service was very very prompt with entire crew on top of things.   We ordered three dishes: the American, the Californian, and an order if poutine fries (which was a pleasant surprise on the menu). I'll let sav review her own food but here is how mine was.   Californian comes on a waffle that is not sweet at all but very light, and much light than sandwich bread or a bun. It had turkey that was actually turkey, not deli sliced sandwich meat sadness that is typically served. Bonus points for red leaf lettuce instead of iceberg, and the cream cheese herb spread was great as well.   Lastly, the poutine. Huge fries covered in beef stock gravy and melted white cheese. It was incredible to the point of wanting to drive an hour plus to get to get, while reciting the words to "o canada" and itching to go to a hockey game.   Keep it up and open a location or good truck in the easy valley!

More Colorado influence approaching the valley and thus far I love it. Less like a pasta chipotle and more along the lines of fast fresh casual.   Very fast and friendly service; good amount of local canned beers and bottles from Colorado (saw new Belgium and one other I didn't recognize).   Between the two of us, had one Mac and cheese and one Tuscan something or other. The Mac and cheese was very traditional in that it was pure elbows and light cheese sauce. While good in theory, this one missed the mark of the best Mac and cheese in Arizona. The sauce was too viscous, pasta a touch undercooked and overall not flavorful. It's not that it lacked speciality ingredients but more that it lacked strong cheese flavor and was largely just "there". The Tuscan was pretty impactful with a hearty whole wheat pasta and picked red onion, Parmesan, and other ingredients.   Pretty good and relatively cheap fare.  Worthy of cheat meal? Your call, probably hit or miss.   Mac and cheese? Okay, but lack luster. My journey for the best Mac and cheese in Arizona continues.

This place is the gym that I have always wanted; one that has everything from machines, to more than enough free weight, pool, classes, batting cages, and more.   Sav r and I came across this place after touring a few gyms in the area to see if there was something we could improve. I won't speak ill about youfit or la fitness that we had previously been members of but they were simply not fitting our needs when it came to exercise. I was tired of not being able to workout due to lack of power racks and over capacity, sav missed her classes. A chance trip to gorge ourselves on China Way ended with a trip inside.   Andre, who I assume to be the owner, showed us everything that was avail, and everything to come. Since I joined in December of 2015, more cardio machines, more spin bikes and more extra features have been added (mainly the tanning booths and batting cages/golf range). While a work in progress at the time of this review, it has all been positive and moving forward ahead of schedule. There is even going to be a suggestion box for members to ask for classes and or amenities in the gym; I have yet to hear about such an open forum provided at other places.  This place, due to its convenient nature of being across the street from my house and now 24 hour, has been a god send. I have lost 10 lbs, gained muscle, and consider fitness my newest and most devoted hobby.   I will save sharing what we pay for our membership, and say that I would gladly pay double or triple if it meant this place could always stay here and be operated by such cool people. Speaking of staff, I highly suggest a weekend night spin class with Tiffany. I am usually not much for fitness classes, preferring the solitude of headphones and intense focus but Tiffany is the best instructor I have had. Doing her classes has also inspired me to train for the biking portion of a sprint triathlon in Octobers. Monday Tuesday and Wednesday expect me huffing and puffing in overly sweaty Seattle Mariners merch.   Is this place for everyone? I am not sure that it is, but you would be hard pressed to not find one thing that you love about this gym. I am glad to have found a workout home   Keep it up!

Outstanding Thai food a great customer service. The owner is probably the only person I have ever met who is grateful and excited about every single thing that a customer does. Really high level of energy that is quiet refreshing.   I em ever venture very far through Thai food menus because I am unfamiliar with most; two dishes I have had here are the pad Thai with chicken and the drunken noodles. The pad Thai is unique in that it has thinner rice noodles and not an overt peanut/peanut butter flavor. It avoids being heavy and greasy turning into something with a lot of flavor that is really lite.   Drunk enough noodles have a strong spice and hearty flavor that is perfect for the 30 seconds of winter that Arizona will get per year.   I visited this place when it was another Thai restaurant and the new ownership has improved eveything from decor to service to food. Defiantly always a place on our minds for a nice week night dinner

What's not to love about an old New York favorite? Recent short order food and cool atmosphere, with out the Manhattan style lines to push your patience over the edge.   Last time I ate at a shake shack was at city field in queens, when the mets were still the mets (meaning they were in their rightful place getting smashed by a sub .500 Cincinnati Reds team). The menu looks to have expanded and improved.   I don't remember hot dogs being on the menu, so I indulged in a chicken dog that was very juicy and completed the set of cheese fries very well. Bonus points for throwing calories on the board (this is something az eateries are very hot or miss on).   Revolutionary? No, but this is one east coast influence I won't mind eating at again and again.

I have been waiting rd for a place like the famous diddy reise ever since I left la. This place comes pretty close.   Every ice cream sandwich place should be judge primarily by their chocolate chip cookies. These did not disappoint, both the chocolate chip and double chocolate chip were great; combined with way too much mint ice cream.    There is a great outdoor seating area in the back (with no back access unfortunately); if you have a dog with you they have no problem letting them walk through the store front to the patio. Only complaint is that the top 20 pop remix was so loud it was hard for new people to hear the explanation from the employees on how to order .   Keep it up! Nice addition to a slowly emerging downtown Chandler

Happy to be the first to review with new location to an Arizona (Chicago?) institution.   What more is there to say other than great pizza and great prices? This location has only booth seating and brand new tvs for any type of sporting event. My place to watch the Stanly Cup finals in a few weeks? I think so!
