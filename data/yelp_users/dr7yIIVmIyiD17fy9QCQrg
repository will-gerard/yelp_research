I'm not a big fan of vietnamese food but I have found several tasty options in my travels. This restaurant had some of the best entrees I have had in a long time. It was plentiful and extremley good.   This did not help the location and decor. When you go somewhere that is trying too hard to be trendy there are some expectations. The plastic seats made it feel like I was at a Burger King. That made me feel like I was over paying even though the food was real good. I would go back for the food but the sad truth is as good as the food is, I would want a better environment.

For my second review I wanted to write a review on a restaurant my wife loves but I felt like a prisoner at. For all you guys out there take your girl there but make sure you visit Jack in the Box before you pick her up.   The Good... This restaurant food was extremely tasty. Each item we ordered was flavorful on many different levels. this is definitely a Quality over Quantity kind of place. Also, the Specialty drinks were Legendary. That's about it.   The Bad... Price. More to the point, we dropped about $300 w/ wine and drinks and I was still hungry. We had their full experience menu. Also the service was attentive but not friendly at all. In fact, they were very pretentious. (I had to look that word up) On the Price to experience ratio, this place just isn't worth it. It is however, the kind of place that most guys will end up having to go to. I would avoid this at all cost. There are plenty of other places that serve food that is just as good and isn't as snobby as this place. I would give it one star but seriously, the food tasted great. However the small paper thin strip of Salmon was literally the size of a notepad. You can display it however you want but charging these prices is just not for 95% of us.

The Egg...  I try a lot of breakfast places and I have tried several of their locations and each time I have I have had a good plain breakfast. The truth is it was nothing special. The food is just that, nothing special.   The Good, the place is nice, friendly staff.  The Bad, they are normaly short staffed and this leads to mistakes. I've had 3 bad meals due to server error. Each time fixed but given how busy they are, they should be better prepared. Lastly, the food just isn't that good. The steak and eggs are plain and the beef dosn't taste like steak...   Last word is I'd rather go to Denny's if I am going to have a basic breakfast. It's a better chain...

This is a hidden Gem in Phoenix. I am a huge fan of small dives. Breakfast places are hard to find. Too many Good Egg clones that don't realize if you want a cheap basic breakfast... Go to Denny's. When you want to upgrade and not really pay much more... splurge at Harlow's...  The Bad... Parking is a pain and during college season, it's pretty packed. The ambiance is a real dive. I mean it's not much to look at but it is comfortable. Lastly it gets pretty hot there during the summer.   The Good, prices are awesome. I have had the steak and eggs, chorizo, and huevo's rancheros. All are completely great. I've also splurged w/ various pies and all have been good. I try to sneak in here every chance I can and hope to see you there.

This is the most overrated pizza I have ever waited 2 hours for. Oh and it's pricy as well. I'm sure there are a small percentage of foodies that love this place and talk it up but I'm here to tell you, most normal patrons won't like paying this much for sub par fancy pizza.   Ultimatly, there 2 star rule applies... Meh, I've had better...

This is another example of a foodie place. The food is actualy real good but the price is just inside of outragous. Come on, it's a burger... not fillet minion... Don't get me wrong, it was good but total bill was just too high for me to want to go back there.  Oh and don't get me started on the parking...

This stadium is like a giant UFO landing on an open field. A total Eye Sore. Plus the Team has been a total underachiever. But these aren't the only reasons I am completely down w/ the the stadium. First off, the prices of the tickets are awful. The stadium itself is designed horribly to keep the fans as far away from the field that even w/ binoculars you miss the action. But paying 50+ for 2nd tier and nosebleeds... that's outragous.   Then there is the location. With all the open space you would think that they would design proper parking and roads. Getting to and from the stadium takes 1 hour to reach the freeway 1 mile away. The parking situation is just stupid bad.   Lastly there is the staff/organization. The NFL implimented a new bag rule and the security at the gates were rude and ignorant of the rules. I had a small camera bag. I was told to throw it away or take it back to the car. No where around were the rules associated w/ the new bag rule. just this rude, bored bouncer. After throwing it away I found out that bags 4.5 x 6.5 are acceptable. My camera bag was 3x6. Too late, to do anything about it.   Given the problems in parking, staff and over charging I would rather go to Zipps and enjoy the game there. A much better food selection and nicer on the wallet.

I was dragged to this place by my wife who has gotten really into trying new places. I had heard some people talk about it but mostly it was complaints about the price, so I had negative feelings about the place to start.   Upon arriving all I can say is it's not much to look at from the dirt driveway. But once we entered, we were greeted by several extremely friendly hostesses and waitresses. Hands down the restaurant had a fantastic warming, and inviting feeling about it. We were put at ease and that was good because this is part of its charm. The full experience lasted 3 hours.   For dinner we did a full service chef choice thing where they picked for us the wine and food that is perfectly paired. I'm not much on wine but everything seemed to be better w/ the combination. I had no complaints about the food at all. Perfect. When the bill came I had no problem paying the $300 or so because it was well worth it. Taste, portions, service. All A+   on a side note, we went all out and there are a lot of less expensive items on the menu so price is relative to what you order. The Assume service is shared by everyone.

This is not the normal type of restaurant I would go to but I was dragged there by my wifey and I was pleasantly surprised. First off, they have real good selection of pasties... and for that I mean empanada type hot pockets w/ all kinds of different items.  The Good, I had the rosemary chicken pasty and potato wedges. The server was very friendly and on top of things for us. Parking was also a breeze.  The bad: The ambiance was absolutely horrible. It was pitch black and hard to maneuver. The layout was great but too dark to enjoy. The service was great for us but the table next to us was ignored for a long time. Lastly the potato chips were pretty bad. Not sure why the wedges were so good but these weren't edible.  Lastly the bill was not as painful as other places I have been dragged to so I will be back.

WTF? How does this dump rate a 4 star average. I've tried this place 3 times and each time I have been underwelmed. I've heard a lot of people talk reminicently of how great this place is but this has not been my experience.   In my experience, the place always seem dirty. The staff is not friendly at all, just trying to rush you along. The burger tasted like it was under a lamp for hours...   I'll say this, it was consistent as it was exactly like this all 3 times I went. This is fast food so my expectations weren't that high but I'd rather go to Carl's Jr. or Burger king before I would go here.

I am a big fan of movies. Since I'm not in my 20's I have some important rules that help this theater out. 1st off I try to miss openin weekends unless it's a can't miss movie, then I go 1st showing on sundays. This helps reduce the crowds. This also helps w/ everything. The screens and sound are awsome. The 3D is also real good. Lastly, the bathrooms and chairs are also real good.   The few times I've gone on Sat night have been a nightmare. so Just know, that the experience here is great as long as it's not too crowded. Then they have a hard time keeping up.

I have been a regular here during football season, and I have to say, it is a 5 star Sports Bar. This is not to say it compares to fancy places like Fogo d' Choa. But when you compare apples to apples, or beer to beer it is one of the best sports bars I've ever been to.   The GREAT... Their Golden Medium Wings are awesome.   The Good, The waitresses are awesome. They are always friendly and I've never had a problem, and the Football jerseys are a nice touch. All their burgers and sandwiches are also tasty. The Menu is diverse and always good.  The Bad, there is very limited seating in the bar area. There are a few pool tables which are hardly in use.   I hope to see you there...

I tend to visit this location several times a month. This is a great place to get a beer and appetizers. The bar staff is great and it's important to note, this place does everything Good. For example, unlike four Peaks, all their beers are good. However, unlike Four Peaks, all of their beers are just good and they have no great beer to compete w/ Kilt Lifter. I do enjoy their guest beers and their taps of Cider. The food is only good and I would recommend getting pure appetizers as they are the only great dishes. For you guys wanting to bring a date, be prepared to not hear her as this place is particularly loud. At times you can't even hear the music they play in the background. The atmosphere is great and well worth visiting.

For my Very First Review, I wanted to do a no brain-er.   This is by far the best restaurant I've ever been to. If you Love beef, you will love this place. At about $50 per person it is pricey but the beef has awesome flavor and it's all you can eat so get your grub on.   If you Vegetarian, you can get just the salad bar and it is still incredible. I can't give this place enough stars since it is the only restaurant that easily pleases both Carnivores and vegetarians!   I've been to this location several times and each time the food has been amazing. The truly greatest thing about this place is the consistency. Each time we have gone the service, food and experience has been the same. Amazing.   My personal Favorite is the House special. It has great flavor and is mouthwatering. The lamb is also great. each cut is great in it's own unique way. If you like well done or rare, ask the server and they will ensure you get it. Believe me you won't regret trying this place.

First off, this place looks like a great date place. The kind of place you can can bring your girlfriend and please her while still getting your grub on. It isn't. To say this place was a major disappointment is an understatement.   The Good... I ordered steak and ribs and these were okay. The place looks real nice, intimate.   The Bad... The price on everything because... The place is crazy loud and the tables are so close together you can't get to the bathroom w/o bumping someone. The Service was pretty bad. My beer was expensive and tasted awful. When I brought this up, she didn't care. Further she was hardly ever around. I had to pay extra for my side Cesar. My Wife, had an even worst experience. Her food was Awful. The lobster was overcooked, tasted bad. Her salad was awful, borderline spoiled/wilted. our sides were undercooked. Then I had to listen about all this for like 3 hours. To top it all off, we paid premium prices as if this place was Flemings or something. Seriously, if you want okay steak go to Outback or something cause this place is only going to ruin your night.

This has been my third time at iPic and I have to say each time has been great. Although the prices are a little high, the truth is, the food, drink and comfort you get make the whole experience completely worth it.   The bartenders were friendly and the servers were just fantatic. I can't say enough great things about how good the food was. If you havn't tried it, I would recommend the delux seats for your first experience. If that isn't for you, the normal seats are still super comfortable. Way better than any other theater I have been to.

Rudy's is a a bit of mixed bag.   The Good... First off, I'm a fan because the food is real good. They also have a great selection. Lots of options and even some breakfast options. The different sauces are great.   The Bad... I didn't give this place a higher rating and was a bit reluctant to give it 4 stars, because of the seating. When you go out, you expect more than folding tables and hard benches. No Beef ribs...   I recommend getting take out from here.
