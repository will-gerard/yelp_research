Love me some Sutra! Rebecca, the owner,  is welcoming and encouraging.  Best pre/postnatal yoga - it actually felt like I was accomplishing something, and I made some friends along the way!  Can't get enough of their yoga on the roof; they've always got cool yoga events going on.  Love the yoga instructors here, as well as the Skullpt classes.  Wish there was a studio closer to my new house.  Highly recommend if you're in the area!

Read fair reviews on Yelp, so I purchased a 3 month Groupon.  I LOVE Hot Yoga, and needed something close to work.  I've practiced yoga for 5 years, and I'm by no means an expert, but this wasn't my first rodeo.  First class - intermediate level at best and since I wasn't in the front right corner of the room, it wasn't hot at all.  I didn't even break a sweat.  The instructor/owner called out another first timer for doing the wrong pose in her atypical flow.   Not the most challenging yoga I had ever participated in, but I felt like there was still potential for growth.  Second class - Front right corner this time, so it was hot and sweaty.  Before class, the instructor told me how the previous studio I had visited wasn't "real yoga" and "just a business."  Put down the instructor of previous studio, and at the same time dismissed  what I had learned there.  Same sequence as first class, minus tree pose. During class the instructor/owner called me out during Warrior C when I shifted my hands in prayer forward.  "I don't know what you're doing up there..."  Ummm... taking what I need??   Third class - Came in with a pulled chest muscle.  Felt good when I opened it up so I held some of the poses longer, and took a wrap that felt good.  Owner was very specific when Warrior C came up, it was obvious she didn't want my hands moving from heart center forward.  Skipped a few other floor poses that didn't feel good.  Nothing unreasonable or distracting.  When I got home, I had received this email:  Feeling ok today? Dear Amy,    At Yogini's we define our relationship with our students from the beginning. Our guidelines for safe practice sheets are given to you and signed by you when you register in person.  It has been noted that you have not followed the studio or yoga practice guidelines, in that you do not follow instruction and deviate from the rest of the class. As per the guidelines, if this behavior continues, you will be dismissed from the class.  Yogini's, nor their instructors, will be held responsible for any injuries caused by a practitioner who does not follow the instructions and deviates into their "own" practice, as per the waiver and guidelines signed by yPreview and Sendou.  Please remember that as any business, Yogini's has the right to refuse service to anyone.  The guidelines are presented to you when you register for your safety. Please refer to these when returning to Yogini's--the safest studio in Phoenix!  Namaste   Ummm... What!?!  Needless to say, the environment presented during class and the intent of this email made the peace I desired from this yoga unattainable.  I was surprised that any yoga instructor would make eye contact, say goodbye after a class and never bring up what had gone wrong if it was so bad that they would threaten to dismiss me!  I would have appreciated the explanation and opportunity to converse about how to adjust poses to increase complexity/challenge.  I did not appreciate the passive aggressive email, or being chided about not following instructions.  Had I been doing a handstand when everyone else was in Warrior A, I would totally understand, but I extended my arms, and took an extra wrap - not behavior that warrants a demeaning, threatening email.  The studio (minus the carpet - gross!) was beautiful.  The other room that the owner made me change in (she didn't want me using the bathroom off the studio???) has a lot of potential but is just a big warehouse room.  Unfortunately, the business policies and the owner's bristly personality before and during class made this experience extremely sub-par and they'll probably never grow enough to expand to that space.   There are other, way better, yoga studios in the area who are welcoming and don't let their ego run off their clientele.  Groupon was very nice about giving me a refund.

Love, Love, Love!  I've been here two weekends in a row now.  The sibling restaurant to Postino/Churn finally figured out the beer scene with some decent draft choices and the option of keeping the party going at home with growlers and chubs.  The wine coolers were delicious - moreso I found with a straw, but that might be personal preference.  Strawberry Rhubarb is my favorite (so far).   The pizza is great - in the same vein as Humble Pie and Cibo - but better.  In Phoenix, I think only The Parlor could be better.  But when I'm jonesing for a meatball pizza, I'm headed to Federal.  Cozy/swanky interior, sweet little patio outside.    I read about the Corn Coins so we checked them out, but the Mister Mister was better.  Corn is corn.  Corn with cheese is corn with cheese.  Delicious, but not groundbreaking.    Our new go-to for sure!!  It's our new go-to restaurant.

I wonder if the great ratings are from friends of the owners because I cannot fathom this place getting that many great reviews. The 4 star review this place was rocking here made me think I'd give it a chance - the place that was there before it was terrible and I felt like I got suckered into trying that one.  This place is a step up, but ultimately not worth the calorie count.  If I'm gonna tuck into some pizza and wings and spend those hard earned calories, I want it to be worth it.  Or at least warm.    So, we ordered for pickup.  I tried to order online, but the website is ridiculously suck-tastic.  Both the listing of food and the actual program to be able to order online are not set up well.  When I told the person on the phone, she defensively stated that lots of people have said that and the website wasn't her thing.  No apology, no assurance that the correct people would be informed.  YIKES.  When I called the place and the wait time was 35 minutes I thought that was a little on the long side, but it was Saturday at 6:30 so I figured maybe I was being too hard and they were busy.  My husband picked up right on time and we live 3 minutes away. They were not busy. Upon opening the boxes, I found that everything I ordered was cold.  The Asian wings were a bit over-fried, but the sauce was good.  The garlic knots were over-fried chewy balls of dough.  If that's your thing, then they were great. I think if the pizza would have been warm, and it was the only thing we ordered I might feel differently about this place, because the meatballs on the pizza were good. Since it was cold, the crust was tough. I'm not expecting piping hot because we picked up, but I don't expect it to be cold either.  I won't be going back, nor will I be recommending to any friends - the food was MEH and I probably won't even save the leftovers.  I hope the next pizza place that goes into that strip mall learns from its predecessors.
