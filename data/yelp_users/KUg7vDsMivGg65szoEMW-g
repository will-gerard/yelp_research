Growing up in Phoenix, I used to love Havana Cafe. I had birthday dinners here several times. This week, my Dad proposed that we revisit Havana Cafe to celebrate my Master's.  When we arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday, we were one of three tables in the restaurant. The server (there was only one) kept our waters refilled, but it took 25 minutes to have our orders taken. We ordered maduros and black bean fritters to start. The maduros were heavenly, but it is hard to go wrong with a fried plantain. The black bean fritters were... not what I remembered. It may have just been a bad batch, but ours were suspiciously liquid on the inside.   For entree, I ordered Camarones Havana, my Dad had the Cuban sandwich, and my stepmom got a special: several pieces of pork with black beans and rice, yucca root, and more maduros. Dad loved the Cuban sandwich, stepmom seemed to enjoy the pork, but not much of the sides. We had to add a lot of salt to our food when it arrived, I don't think there was any added in the kitchen.   I was disappointed with my ($22) Camarones Havana. I received no sides, and the plate was just bland. It became marginally better with salt, but still. Where's the flavor? I ended up eating black beans and rice off my parents' plates.   By the time we left, the restaurant was mostly full inside, with a few people sitting outside. Because there was only one server, it took us another 20 minutes to get boxes and our check.   Sad to say I don't think I'll be back, unless it's to order some maduros to go.

My boyfriend said that this is his favorite Indian food buffet in the Phoenix, and so we've tried to eat there again. Three times. And every time we've gone there's been no buffet, but were offered the higher price main menu. I don't think we'll try again.

There isn't a Moon Valley child who's knees don't go weak at the mention of "Jade Red" or "Snickerdoodle."  Chino Bandido Takee-Outee is the taste of my youth, the one redeeming restaurant in the entire Moon Valley area and surrounding. Family favorites are the Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken, and Pollo Diablo. A buddy of mine who worked here in high school turned me on to the Jade Red Chicken and black bean burrito. Wow. It is an ethnic flavor explosion.   Don't be afraid of the ordering process, they are there to help you through it the first time (and they let you try the most popular dishes!). After that, it's a cinch. The price is right, too, but it really is a hole in the wall. Don't fight it, embrace the dive-y nature.  My only complaint: When I stopped eating meat, I stopped coming to Chino; if you're not carnivorous, the options are pretty limited (the chile relleno is much too greasy for me, the veggie enchilada is a bit al dente). I ache, literally, for that jade red sauce. O, Great Panda, can't you please put it on some vegetables? Tofu? Anything? I was with you long before Guy Fieri.

Boulders has been my go-to neighborhood bar for a while (BEER LIST), but really exceeded my expectations this week, and merited a review.   I recently coordinated a professional development event for the graduate students in my department. We wanted a place with good beer and food, but also that had a private room that was quiet enough that we could talk. This doesn't seem like a tall order, but Boulders was the only place we knew that had a private, quiet room. I've seen a chess club meet in there a few times.  We had a large party of 15, and we were seated in the "lounge," a room off the main dining area with a booth, a large table, and a door! The room was perfect, and everyone was able to hear the professor that came to speak to us. Our server Jake took excellent care of our group, and was really respectful and deft at delivering orders, refilling waters, and getting additional rounds of beer without interrupting our speaker. He even closed the door quietly as he came and went. I felt like the staff really went above and beyond to accommodate us, and the meeting went off without a hitch thanks to their help.  Thank you, Boulders! I don't think we'll ever meet on campus again. :)

Stopped in here with my boyfriend tonight after we visited Bookman's. He had never had Venezuelan food and was excited at the prospect of deep-fried gluten free empanadas. My Arepa shares a storefront with Rosati's pizza, which made the entrance sort of odd. To order or be seated, go to the window straight ahead once you walk in the door. We were the only people in the restaurant, which always makes me sad at local businesses.   We got two tamarindos to drink and WOW! I was expecting my standard Mexican drive-thru tamarindo but these were to die for. They were made fresh and full of flavor. Can't wait to try some of their other aguas frescas.   I, the vegetarian, ordered a veggie arepa and domino arepa, made with black beans and queso. They were both flavorful and the arepa itself was delicious, but the veggie was the stand out winner, made with sweet plantain, avocado, and queso.  SO ordered the Casaba Parilla plate with steak, yucca, and avocado sauce and a chicken empanada. The flavors of the steak were right on, but the meat was too tough for his taste. The empanada, he said, tasted amazing. Overall, this place is highly recommended: excellent service, and the flavors are very unique! We will be back.

Aloha is our favorite local frozen yogurt place! Always great flavors, boyfriend likes the Ghiradelli chocolate, I'm partial to the sorbets. I also love their double punch Tuesday and 2-for-1 Thursday. Nice patio area and always friendly staff!

Be careful when you order happy hour drinks! Don't open a tab!   Last night, we went to celebrate a friend who graduated and is leaving the country, and came at the beginning of the 7-9 happy hour. We were a pretty large group, and our waitress was very attentive, ensuring that we all had fresh drinks when required. My boyfriend and I each had two old fashioneds (olds fashioned?), which were watered down and full of ice, but for $5 we weren't complaining.   However, when we requested our check at 9:15 (fifteen minutes after happy hour ended), our waitress gave us a group check for almost $300, with everyone charged full price for their drinks. When we complained, she said that she had no way of knowing what time any of us ordered our drinks, so she couldn't give us the happy hour prices, even though we had been there for two hours. Suddenly, what should have been a $20 check became $74, including an outrageous auto-gratuity.   This may not matter to the typical Old Town Scottsdale crowd, but we are graduate students and can't afford a bar tab like that. So, thanks, Mabel's, for stealing my food budget for the week. With every bowl of ramen, I'll think of you.

I love Tasty Thai! Moved my boyfriend to Tempe in January and at the end of a very long moving day, and famished, we called Tasty Thai to pick up. We've been doing the same ever since! I like the standards: tofu green curry, pad thai. Boyfriend is a big fan of their tom kha soup, masaman curry, and pad prik king.   We've tried other thai in Tempe and this is still my favorite. Thai Elephant gave me chicken in my vegetarian curry and food poisoning for both of us, all in one night. I like Thai Basil, but Tasty Thai is more consistent and the owners are really friendly.   The other reason I am motivated to write this review is that TT is always so empty, which breaks my heart since it is so... tasty! Help support a great local business, eat at Tasty Thai.

Came in Saturday morning for breakfast. There was a long line, but it moved quickly. I got the granola pancakes, SO got the morning glory omelet with potatoes. Took about fifteen minutes for our food to arrive. Also, we appreciated that the menu indicated gluten-free items!  Boyfriend was very pleased with his omelet and sides. The granola pancake was basically just granola thrown on to their regular pancake batter. It was good, but I was disappointed to find that one of my pancakes was raw on the inside (next to the granola). We will return, but I am going to get a different dish next time.

I am very pleased with my monthly housekeeping and landscaping service from Clean Service Pro. For my initial appointment, they also fixed some of my broken sprinklers at a very reasonable cost. The price is reasonable and, unlike some other companies that I got quotes from, didn't require that I sign up for weekly or bi-weekly landscaping.   Sandra is very communicative, and all of the staff are very friendly and professional. I am always satisfied with my clean house and yard after a visit from them. I've been a happy customer for over a year now!

Very pleased with our service from David and Arizona Pest Squad. I called about some problems we were having with ants around our sinks; they gave me a quote and alerted me to the Yelp deal, which saved me $50 off my service.   David came out the following morning and was very thorough and informative. I told him that I would rather do only one service than two, as I am on a grad student budget, and he sprayed extra to accommodate my needs. I will definitely call them in the future for pest control!

My old hair stylist left Phoenix last year, and I had bounced around to a few different salons before giving up. With a new job starting, I knew it was time for me to get my hair cut again. I turned to Yelp to try to find a salon in Tempe, and decided to give Foxtail a try! I called and didn't receive a return call, so I texted instead and heard back almost immediately.   I went in this morning to see Candace, and found an inexpensive metered spot next door. The salon, on the first floor of the W2 building, is small and intimate. Candace put on some good music (thank you!) and started to rehab my sad, crunchy hair. She was efficient, friendly, and down to earth. I love my haircut and the affordability compared to other salons! I will definitely be back, and will be telling my friends about Foxtail, too.

I should begin by saying that I really want to like Spokes. Locally-owned, bicycle-friendly bar with a great selection of beer that is just blocks from my house and free of the Mill Avenue crowd. The all-day happy hour on Saturday is great, too.  That being said, I think it is just going to have to be a bar for me. I've been on a handful of occasions now, and have been pleased with my beer experience every time. However, the two times that I have gotten food, I've been disappointed with the quality and price. (First, a grilled cheese with caramelized onion and pear, second, a salmon (no B)LT). Namely, the two sandwiches I purchased had too little flavor and too much grease; I felt like I had to wipe my hands and face after each bite. My friends at dinner each of these nights echoed this sentiment, with sirloin tacos and a burger, respectively.  I'll keep coming back for your beer, Spokes on Southern, but no more food for me until the menu improves.

I'm happy to say that I returned last night to Spokes and had their spinach kale enchiladas with beans and rice, and I was very pleased with the quality of the food! I'm glad that they added another vegetarian option to the menu, and it was delicious. Haven't returned to the other food items that I disliked last time, but maybe during my next visit. Thanks, Spokes!

When I came to Tempe for graduate school two years ago, one of the things I was saddest to leave behind in Tucson was the wonderful $4 Yoga Hour at Yoga Oasis. I looked for a place to practice once I arrived, but I couldn't afford most studios on a graduate stipend, and I didn't like practicing at the rec center (ever tried to do happy baby in front of a bunch of frat boys?). So I stopped practicing.  No longer! I went to class at Yoga To The People today and couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. The space was clean and peaceful, our instructor led us through a mindful practice with suggestions on how to make the poses easier or more challenging depending on experience. It felt very supportive and non-judgmental, even though I was one of only four (!) students there.  What I like best is that they are DONATIONS BASED. Having felt like I had been priced out of studio practice, which is the best way for me to commit to yoga, I am so grateful that YTTP has come to Tempe. For now, I am just going to enjoy it until it gets crowded! And probably after that, too.

Boyfriend and I really enjoyed our experience at Chop Shop. We came for a late lunch on Friday and it was about half full indoors. I ordered a tofu teriyaki protein bowl, boyfriend got the chicken prosciutto sandwich at the recommendation of the young woman at the cash register. $23 for the two meals and two lemonades.   We waited about 15 minutes for our food, but passed the time with the free magazines they have to read. The tofu bowl was excellent; the teriyaki sauce had a subtle spiciness and I really enjoyed the forbidden rice and roasted vegetables. Large portions, too! Boyfriend liked his chicken prosciutto sandwich ("I'm full but I can't stop eating, it's too good").  As a side note, they were having problems with the music. It sounded like a CD was skipping? Lasted the duration of our lunch. I would rather have no music than intermittent music.  We're excited to come back to try breakfast. I'm just afraid of how packed it will be when school begins next week!
