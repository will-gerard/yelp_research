I have been eating at Flamingo Palace for at least a decade. It is my standard against which I judge other Chinese restaurants.  The egg rolls are the best I've ever had.

My wife and I have been going to Dr. Paul Coulombe for 15-20 years now (it's hard to remember). Everyone to whom we've recommended him loves his thoroughness and bedside manner and has stayed with him for five to ten years now. When our children were born (four of them), he "visited" them in the hospital even though he didn't have rights and he's been their doctor ever since--they're pre-teens now. Point is, he's a wonderful doctor and we trust him entirely with our medical care.  His recommendations for specialists have been impeccable, his advice on all facets of our health is wise and up-to-date, and his services never seem money-driven.

This is our favorite place for Mexican food currently. My all-time favorite is Carlos O'Briens, but it's too far of a drive when you just want some takeout.  The beans are phenomenal, as are the chicken chimichangas and homemade tortillas. I have never had a bad meal here and I've gone at least a dozen times. My only complaint was that the outstanding tortillas are way too big: storage is a real problem and there invariably ends up being too much leftover tortilla when making a reasonably-sized burrito with them.  The atmosphere is Filiberto's but the fare is worth it.

Our large team of developers and testers had a class there last week. Our cooking ability was mixed, to put it mildly. I think everyone had a great time and the food was surprisingly good considering the uneven competence of the preparers (I'm solidly in the low end of that spectrum).  It was very relaxed and Chef Harrison and his assistant Chance did a capable job in getting us organized and functional. The only problem was that I sometimes had no idea what I was doing and the chefs were busy with other people. So I ended up standing idle for a lot of time. I wouldn't fault them for that: our group numbered 16 and I think it was just too many people to whip into shape so quickly.  I would recommend them for classes and suggest that 8-10 would be a more appropriate group size to get the most out of what they offer.

I really like their food--the cheese steak is excellent--but I have had *nothing* but trouble with their takeout. Dining in is better.  The key to takeout is to take the order correctly, fill the order correctly, and have it up when you say you will. They have messed up each part of that equation and consistently failed in filling my orders. I now avoid getting takeout from this location because I have been burnt four times.  They did get the order correct once. I laboriously inspected each and every item to confirm that it was as I expected. The cashier asked if everything was okay and I explained my plight. She said that she'd put a credit on the account for the sandwich that they consistently got wrong and I left in good spirits. They had not only gotten the order right (slightly later than expected but I can forgive them that) but they actually practiced some Customer Service!  My elation was short-lived. They messed up the order on the next visit and my claiming of the credit was thwarted because no credit was actually applied. Nevermore.

I've eaten at Ari three times now and I'm a fan. I ate often at its predecessor, Katana Sushi, but always found the fare there too hot for my liking. Ari doesn't have that problem at all.  It's not the best sushi in the Valley (I think Tokyo Lobby has that distinction) but it is nearest to me and the variety is both astounding and dizzying. We're slowly working our way through the 50 states menu and hope that it stays in business long enough for us to accomplish that.  My one big complaint is that the miso soup is below average. Usually miso is a good bellwether for us when judging a Japanese restaurant, but I guess we can't rely solely on that any longer.

After eating there at least monthly for the last year, Tokyo Lobby is a distant memory. We have a new item every time we order and we've still barely made a dent in the impressive menu!  The place isn't fancy, but who cares? It is clear that it's a family business who has no aspirations to becoming a nationwide chain. And that's fine by me.  The waitress is very friendly: greeting me by name when I walk through the door, remembering my orders (even when I forgot to get my usual garlic tuna roll), and giving me small treats as I wait for my takeout. The owners are similarly pleasant, so i imagine that it's part of their customer service culture.  I recommend Ari Sushi to everyone I know that lives near the area and they all have loved it as well. The place has gotten busier, which results in longer wait times at the peak. But it's the price you have to pay to make sure that it stays in business.

My wife and I were big fans of Blue Nile Cafe in Tempe. When it closed, we were left with a big tasty void in our lives. The other Ethiopian restaurants we tried just didn't stack up but we pressed on and hoped for something better.  Gojo is the new Blue Nile Cafe for us.  We didn't see sambusa on the menu so we asked. Sure they'd make them for us. They were outstanding: bigger than Blue Nile's and smaller than Messob's (our reigning favorite Ethiopian in Los Angeles) and so flavorful.  We had the Ethiopian iced tea and it was delightful. It's like regular iced tea but with Ethiopian spices. I'd highly recommend it as it's not intense at all.  We ordered two of the meat and vegetable combos, but the waitress suggested we'd only need one since they're substantial. I appreciated that. The injera was perfect, the dishes were exemplary. If you like Ethiopian food, this is the place you need to try!
