I recently had the opportunity to cater a small event at MonOrchid and I have to say, if you are looking for a unique, artsy and really special venue for your event, this place is it!  I could easily see how the space could lend itself beautifully to weddings, bridal showers, as well as corporate or team building events and I would love to see live music there--I am sure it would be a stellar small concert venue as well.    As an added bonus, Wayne, the owner of the MonOrchid, is such a personable guy, making it a real pleasure to do business in his amazing space.

Although the space itself is really beautiful, My first visit to St. Francis left me longing for the tiny digs and reliably excellent food of Matt's. On the plus side, our party of 6 was seated without wait, the wait staff provide lots of good eye candy and the service was friendly and prompt.  The food was just ok.  I had the fried egg sandwich which comes with their roasted fingerling potatoes and small ramekins of their 'Mexican ketchup' and chipotle mayo. Everything on the plate was boring. There are just too many ways to make a great breakfast potato, so these bland, unseasoned fingerlings were disappointing and neither condiment wowed me. I thought it odd that no salt or pepper were on any table and I thought I might insult the chef by asking for them.  I assumed the absence of such basic 'comforts' must mean they believe everything is coming out of the kitchen perfectly seasoned. Guess again guys. It is never a good thing when a table full of famiodis foodies take in an entire meal at a new place without a single rave or a 'holy socks Batman, this is killer!!'.  Nope, not a single holy anything in the beautifully styled St. Francis. My other non food related negatives are the lack of parking and the VERY uncomfortable seating. They do offer complimentary valet service in their postage stamp sized lot but it looked like a crazed chess game as we waited (in the rain)  for a stupid long time for the valet to 'free' our cars. The seating is bench style, on which there are no backs, so you are either practicing perfect posture throughout you meal or you are leaning into the backs of perfect strangers. Either way, it is weird and uncomfortable. All in all , I most likely wouldn't go out of my way to go back.

Beautiful, local produce with the added convenience of 'one stop shopping'. This service is perfect for people who want to support local agriculture but don't have the time to browse the Farmers Markets each week. The process was easy and the product was awesome. Why didn't I think of this?!

I always feel right at home at Parking in front of Aaron's. I actually prefer it to parking in front of my own home, even though it is a several block walk. Whenever I need a parking spot in The Coronado, this is my 'go to' place.
