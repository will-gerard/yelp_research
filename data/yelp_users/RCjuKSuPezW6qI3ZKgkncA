I love LGO! Everything that I have had here is always very fresh tasting and delish!  My favorite lunch salad is the smoked salmon salad.  You can also take your dog here and sit on the patio which is very nice since there are not a ton of places in Phoenix to bring your pup! The Tammie Coe desserts are also to die for!  The last time I went I got the coconut cupcake, I thought I made good cupcakes, but then I tried this one!  Very moist and the cream cheese frosting was amazing!

Usually I love me some LGO but today I received the worst service I have had in a long time. I took some new Lgo-ers here after convincing them that they have the best salads and nice friendly staff. To begin...the cashier was very rude when one of the salads was asked to be made without cheese. Then after waiting over 25 minutes for our 3 salads there were no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long. The worst part of it all is when we complained about the wait, the manager was standing right there and said nothing!

I love Dr.Andre and her staff. I brought my french bulldog here to get ACL surgery and they have been great. They do a lot of rescue animals in order to keep costs down. I ended up bringing in my new french bulldog puppy as well. I would highly recommend this vet!

I went on a Sunday night just before it was closing around 6:30 pm. My first impression was that the decor and space was lacking but then I tried the food! Everything I tried was amazing and was not greasy at all. I had grilled trout with rice and my boyfriend had an empanada and an arepa. All of the dishes were superb and we will definitely be returning. We both recently moved to the west side for school and this restaurant is by far our favorite on this side of town!

I LOVE YC's! I like the fact that you can choose if you want to be super healthy with veggies and tofu or go and pig out on meat and noodles. YCs is never disappointing and is now located by a fro yo place so win-win!

I always leave here happy and full! The cocktails are very tasty and at a good price point. If you come at lunch the crowd is usually business men but nighttime is a different story. There are always trendy good looking people to look at while enjoying some appetizer pita and hummus and a delicious pasta dish. If you are still hungry try one of their 16 different gelato flavors.

The atmosphere is very dark and you feel almost closed in.  But the food makes up for it. The greek salad and the tikka masla is really good.  The workers are all tatted up and seem kinda unshowered.  The happy hour has good car bomb specials.

Service was decent but not great, they kept on coming by and asking what we ordered.  The place is pretty small so the waiter should remember who ordered what!  The food was decent except my dinner salad came out way earlier than the rest of the meals, even before the apps!

So delish!  I have been wanting to go here for years and we finally went just as I am about to move to Portland!  Anyways it was so good.  We got the bruschetta and the scallops as an app.  The scallops were superb, perfectly cooked.  I got the penne putanesca, which was also really good.  To finish off the awesome meal we had the bread pudding.  All in all it was a great meal and I will definitely be returning when I come to visit my family in Arizona.

I used to frequent this nail salon all the time when I lived up in North Scottsdale. But I still go back when I visit my mom. The owner is so nice and always remembers your name. The services are great as well, with many choices and options to choose from.

We went on a D-Backs game day!  The food was pre-prepared and the waitress did not even know what "well/ house vodka" was.  The service was alright but was def not worth the price or wait!   Most likely won't return!

The lemonade, the lunch, the grocery store...everything here is amazing! I randomly ended up here today for lunch and the reviews did not disappoint. The pita bread was fluffy, the hummus was smooth, and the salad dressing tasted very fresh and authentic. The man at the cash ( I am assuming the owner) sold me on the lemonade which was probably the best lemonade ever! The lemonade is made with rosewater and honey, no sugar added. I will be returning soon to try their famous Baklava!

I stopped in here for lunch with my sister around 1:30 on a Tuesday and we were the only people in there.  The service was horrible, I mean we were the only people in there so it was pretty extreme how bad the service was.  The food took forever so I asked for some bread.  What came out were hard pieces of stale bread.  I got the shrimp salad that ended up being 20 dollars with tax.  And to our surprise on the bill the bread cost 2.50!!!!!!!!!!! I was outraged! I will never be returning!

Even though this location is not the best I still love Target. If you really want a good target experience drive a little more south and hit up the Tempe Marketplace location or go a little more north and go to the Raintree location.

DELISH! The coconut marg is sooo good and everything else!  We had the table side guac and the shrimp appetizer.  For the main course we had the mahi mahi tacos and the black cod dinner.  The sauces on all of the dishes are very tasty!  For dessert we got the pumpkin bread pudding which was AMAZING to say the least! Will definitely be returning! :)

Whether its a happy hour outing or a hung over brunch this place never disappoints. I like how there is a cucumber in the water and the wait staff is always very friendly! The portion sizes are pretty huge so depending on how hungry you are, you can take home some left overs!

This yogurt place is way better than any of the others around the area.  They have unique toppings such as strawberry and mango boba and delish baklava.  They also have the awesome oatmeal cookie flavor, last night they featured a new flavor "bit o honey" and it was awesome!

I am def going to miss this place!  Back when I lived in AZ I went or picked up food from here at least once a week.  The greek salad and broiled chicken salad has the greatest dressing ; not too heavy not too light!  The chicken shwarma wrap is good as well, get extra pickles on the side, they are very tangy and have a different flavor to them.  The trio hummus for an app. is always a good bet and their local organic wines are quite flavorful!

This location is very nice and always has great take out service. I usually go with the hummus plate and one of the soups. The bread that they give with their salads are definitely worth the drive!  The cupcakes are sub--par so don't waste your money on them!

I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!

Waaaaay better than your average Americano or other espresso drink. I have only been a few times because parking in old town scottsdale can be annoying, but will definitely try to make more of an effort to get more espresso from here! And as a plus there are cute Hipster boys :)

I went here with my mom as a birthday/ mom day celebration. The decor is beautiful and had a great experience there. For the price of the services you get a great deal! English speaking people, a soothing atmosphere, and a great location right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  I also liked that the owner is an ASU grad, Go Sun Devils!

I went here today for lunch and was super excited to try it out based on the 5 star reviews... What I found was a 2 star restaurant. I would be shocked to find out if everything and/or anything was freshly prepared in house. I had a grilled chicken pita that tasted mediocre and my mom had a caesar salad which I swear is from Costco! If you are looking to spend 8+ on a meal that can easily be picked up from the pre made section of a grocery store then be my guest and give this place a shot.

After hitting up the food trucks at the Phoenix Open Air Market on Wednesday we went to grab some beers and dessert at this place. We had the apple pop tart, which was pretty flipping good. They change the flavors seasonally and had just missed the pumpkin one :( They have a rotating list of craft beers on tap which was pretty neat. And our waitress told us about the great brunch they have on Sundays! I will definitely be returning to try it out.

I learned about this place through Yelp and figured I would give it a shot. Not only was I blown away by the food but the owners were very nice and really seem like they care about their business and customers. The place is owned by brothers and even have their own mother cooking in the kitchen. It is hard to find a Lebanese place in Scottsdale that is truly authentic and tastes fresh. My usual go to Mediterranean place is Pita Jungle, but I will make the extra drive to come back here next time I am craving some jalapeno cilantro hummus!!!

Restaurant quality tacos on the cheap! I ordered the shrimp taco and a chicken taco and they were both great. You can definitely appreciate the fresh ingredients. You can either do the drive thru option or order up at the window and eat outside. I did not really know what to expect but I will definitely be returning!  -I would highly recommend  this restaurant if you are looking for a fast,cheap,not greasy taco!  ps try the Horchatta!

I was very excited to come and try out this new healthy restaurant. I was very unsatisfied with the portion size and price. The flavors of the salad were very good but for $11 I would have hoped for a bigger meal. I have not tried the juices yet, but they too run pretty price at $7 each.

I went here today for a belated Mother's Day Lunch and loved every minute of it. My mom ordered the egg white frittata with a side of potatoes and I ordered the rice bowl and added chicken. The ambiance is very warm and inviting, it reminded me a lot like Portland (my old hood). The servers were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely  be back for breakfast,lunch,dinner,coffee, and desert.

I went on a Friday night with high expectations after reading some of the Yelp reviews. When we arrived we had to wait 10-15min for a table (not a long wait) and the staff kept apologizing for the long wait time, which I thought was nice. We sat down and the waitress looked like she was in a huge rush to take our orders so we ordered the house marg and some guacamole. I was excited that the marg was only $3 but came to figure it was probably due to the undetectable amount of alcohol content... Overall the waitress was rude,didn't give us napkins after asking twice, and then food was meh. Would not be eager to return.

5 stars! I have been to many "make your own salad places", but Freshbox has the best and most unique ingredients by far. I had a salad with chicken and the blood orange vinaigrette. I also had the cold brew coffee which was not acidic at all and had a great carmel after taste! I am glad Freshbox is in North Scottsdale. I will most definitely be returning!
