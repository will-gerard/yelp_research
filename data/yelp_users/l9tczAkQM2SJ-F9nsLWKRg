I've been here before my visit, but we had a party of six. The food was cold, the service staff was rude, and the manager left in the middle to take care of business. We were here on a Sunday and it was not that busy.

Loved...loved...loved the food! It was decently priced and get a lot of chicken. I got the food pretty fast and the service was nice. Highly recommend.
