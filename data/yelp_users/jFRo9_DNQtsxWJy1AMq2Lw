Place is definitely out dated and quite frankly I feel like 75% of people here have the ability to shank me at any moment. Its still a fun place for mini golf. They try to stick it to you for rides, probably because they realize there are only 3 rides people would get on. Place needs a face lift for sure. Name is a little misleading, "Castles & Coasters"... more like "semi castle on hole 8 and one coaster"

Why the hate? I see a lot of bad reviews on here and do not understand why. The place is no 5 star eatery by any means. But its good mexican food if in the area, again not great like some old fashion joints make it but it's at least a few steps above Filiberto's. Staff is friendly, place is never too packed. I reccomend the carne asda burrito with cheese sour cream and hot sauce only. Even the bean and cheese burrito is pretty good with a large chicken taco. Give this place a chance but don't go in expecting to be blown away.

Love this place! Jeff and Dave along with their staff seem to always make every experience a good one! They are very knowledgeable when it comes to their products and I always see results after following their advice! The smoothies are great but I suggest for those who lift to try their ISOPure products in the fridge, mmmm darn good.

Steak tasted like chewy rubber, had to wait forever to get water, games are over priced. Really feel like there is no organization, I only go here when forced or because its on someone else's tab.

Our waitress Jessica was fantastic! My buddy and I wanted to stop in for a quick drink/meal. We were promptly taken care of which made the atmosphere and experience more enjoyable!

Love this place plain and simple. Hands down always enjoyable service and drinks! The customer service is always great and I always make a new friend when I'm there (3 of which follow me on instagram) I go out of my way for that coffee!

Not a bad place for an average night out to eat or for lunch. Had the Lariat burger, nothing too special but still a good burger. By the taste I'm assuming their meat if naturally raised cows from Montana. Good prices as well!
