This market is always fun to visit even if I don't have something specific I need to buy. It has an awesome selection of products from many different countries so if there is something you need that you can't find at your regular grocer I bet it will be here!

Best pho I have found. My friend and I have "Pho Phridays" and eat there every time we want pho. Fresh ingredients every time and everyone there is super friendly. They remember their regulars and make sure to seek us out to make sure everything is to our satisfaction. I highly recommend this restaurant!

This place is awesome! I visited the shop after seeing it in passing a few times. Any candy you could possibly ever want is here. No joke. Friendly atmosphere and more candy than anyone would know what to do with. It is like a candy wonderland!

I would love to give a review of the food but I never got to try it. My husband and I ordered on a Friday night and after an hour and a half of waiting I checked in. When I mentioned I have been waiting the lady automatically said "do you want to cancel or wait?" No apology no reason for it being late. I asked how much longer and she said 30 minutes. Once it was 2 and a half hours I called again. After the phone rang for 2 minutes the lady answered out of breath. I told her we still haven't gotten our food and I want to cancel. She said okay and hung up. Around 10 at night there is a knock on our door and the food arrived.... 3 hours late... we told them we cancelled the order and didn't want the food. He said he was never told and started arguing with my husband. After all of that my card was still charged and I had to file with my bank to get the charges reversed. The delivery person's excuse for being late? "What do you expect for a Friday night?" NEVER AGAIN.
