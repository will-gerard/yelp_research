Jesse James is amazing and now he has added a new massage therapist named Evan. Evan was amazing! He really made me feel very comfortable and explained everything he was doing and it all made complete sense. His type of massage was something I have never experienced before. I would recommend a massage with Evan!

Are you kidding me? Look at the instruction paper they give you at check in. The insult their guests... " The Shower " Normally we require our guests to have an engineering degree to operate our vintage era shower, however if you do not have the necessary qualifications blah blah and then it says Shirley we don't have to tell you how a tv works? And if so there is a hint. Point the button covered thing. Who says this kind of crap to their guests? Major no!

Well the chips and salsa were good while it lasted now been waiting 15 minutes for refills on our sodas and chips. I had to get up and find our server just to get those and he seemed upset that I even asked. Waiting on our food order to come which was taken about 20 more minutes. Oh did I mention we waited for a table for 25 minutes when they said 10 then we get shoved in the corner with a loud family blehh

My sister and I came in today to look at the store and Rudy helped us. He was very professional and knew his products well. I would definitely recommend this store for all your flooring needs.
