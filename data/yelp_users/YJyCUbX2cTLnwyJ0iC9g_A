When we arrived, from the front of the building...it didn't look very promising and my heart kinda sank a little.  But once we got inside the courtyard...I actually felt like I was in Paris (except for the dry AZ heat).  We (there were three of us) took a table outside near the fountain and since it was BYOB and I had printed out a coupon for the free corking fee, we brought a bottle to accompany our meal.  For starters, we had the cheese plate & the pate...and it was delish.  I got the duck and it was perfectly crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and full of flavors.  I don't recall what my companions had...but they equally enjoyed their meals.  Consistent w/the service in Paris, we found the wait staff here to be efficient & brisk.  My boyfriend is not a fan of uppity fancy restaurants...but he also really enjoyed the food and experience here.

This place is so awful that I don't even want to spend too much time writing this review.  Food is mediocre, service was extremely rude, my catering order was never filled and when I called to confirm the order one hour prior to pickup they just simply told me they didn't make it and wasn't planning on doing it...huh?  I once found a cooked cockroach in my dim sum dish...that was it...would never ever go back.

Came here for a late last minute Mother's Day lunch.  We got the Rancher Salad, the Arizona Pressed Sandwich w/a side of the artichoke salad, the White Pizza & a slice of Carrot Cake.  All the dishes and sides were wonderful and the service was super friendly and prompt.  The ambiance was also really chill and the outside patio was very cute.  I think this is my new favorite place in downtown Gilbert.  Will have to come back to check out their breakfast offerings.

NOTE: This review was written by my other half, Matt.  Recently we had our A/C serviced by April Air Conditioning.  We returned home from an out of town weekend trip to find our house hot throughout and our A/C not running.  It was 10 pm when we called, and we had to pay an extra $60 to get a technician out that evening.  We decided to have someone out, and about 30 - 45 mins later Bryan Hall from April arrived at our house.  I told him the heat pump was not running at all, and there was only warm air coming out of the vents.  After a quick check of the heat pump outside, he said there was probably a leak in the system.  At this point I was a bit uncomfortable not knowing what was going on, if his assessment was correct, etc.   He was very patient while I thought about what to do and did some quick searching on the internet about air conditioning problems.  I asked him what the next steps were, and he said he could pressurize the system to look for a leak.  I decided to have him continue, and he went up in to the attic and took the compressor apart, sprayed the copper coil with soap bubbles, and found the leak right away.  I was impressed by how quickly he got this figured out, considering how hard it seems to be to find leaks sometimes, based on what I read online.  At this point, he helped me decide what to do by giving me my options, and also gave me an exact quote based off a list of prices in a binder that he had with him, that covered all the types of services offered.  I decided to get the leak fixed at a cost of ~$700 for everything.  It was midnight at this point, and he was very tired, so he offered to return the next morning at 6 am, 2 hours before his scheduled shift.  I agreed and met him the next morning.   He got to work straight away, recovering all of the R22 refrigerant, soldering the leak closed, testing with nitrogen, installing a drier/filter, pulling a vacuum, and adding the new refrigerant.  By this time I had time to review lots of postings online about air conditioning servicing.  I'm an engineer, so it was easy to absorb this quickly, and I watched closely as he did his work to verify it and to learn more from watching him.  It took longer than expected due to the vacuum taking a long time, but he was patient and very thorough.  He checked everything and we started the house cooling.  I would highly recommend Bryan Hall from April Air Conditioning for any A/C work that you might need done at your house.

What can I say about Four Peaks that hasn't been said before?  Great beer...wonderful food...fun crowd...cool building...and very reasonable prices.  Some of my fav food items are the Spinach Artichoke Dip, the Garden Burger (prob one of the best I've had), the Beer Bread Sandwiches, the Pizzas and def the Spanakopita.  Being a girly girl (& not much of a beer fan) I really like their Hefeweizen & Peach beer and my boyfriend always go for the Kiltlifter.  The only complaint I have about this place is that I've been here countless times and I can't recall ever getting good service.

Went here for breakfast on a Sat w/several girl friends after doing a 5K at Tempe Town Lake.  The coffee was really really good (I drank about 4 cups and I'm not even a coffee drinker) and our waitress was so good about keeping it warm and full (even though they were busy).  A friend and I shared the Huevos Rancheros (w/green pork chili) & the Seafood Omelet (w/o the Hollandaise sauce - we both didn't care for the texture or taste).  Since we didn't want the Hollandaise sauce, we asked for extra green pork chili for our Seafood Omelet and our waitress happily & promptly brought it.  The potatoes were also really good and we both polished off our plates.  I can see why this place is so popular and would highly recommend.

Our friends go to this joint a lot and raved about it so we decided to give it a try since we were in the area.  We've both been to Thailand numerous times and have frequented plenty of local as well as out-of-state Thai restaurants...and this place was a real let down.  We ordered the Pad See Ew and the Spicy Eggplant (w/shrimp & chicken) and also Thai ice tea.  We ordered both dishes at a level "1" spicy.  Even though we both could eat medium spicy...we weren't in the mood for really spicy food...so decided to go w/a "1" just for a little kick.  I can pretty much predict how the food is going to be by judging the Thai ice tea...and it appeared too clear, tasted watered down (lacking in the essential tea flavor), too sweet & had an artificial sweetener after taste.  My Spicy Eggplant looked beautiful upon arrival and I got my hopes up...but once I dug in...it was way too spicy.  I'm not sure if there was no flavor to my dish or if it was so spicy I couldn't taste the flavor. When the lady came back to ask me how my food was and I told her it was really spicy for a 1...she told me I should order it non-spicy the next time.  I thought that was kind of dismissive since I didn't want my food non-spicy...just at the level that I ordered and could enjoy.  All the meat & vegetable also looked like it had been steamed or boiled and then a sauce poured over it...no absolutely no pan sauteed look, smell or taste.  Our Pad See Ew noodle was mushy and unappetizing...and it didn't taste too much better than it looked.  I did notice that it wasn't as oily as stirred fried noodles usually are so maybe that's why it was clumpy & mushy?  One good thing I do have to say about the place is that the decor and ambiance was really nice and the rest of the wait staff were friendly.  Overall, I would have given this place 3 stars if it hadn't been for the patronizing attitude from the one lady.

Be still my beating heart!  When I moved here almost four years ago...I was looking for a restaurant to host a very special occasion for 7 guests.  I went around and checked out several highly recommended establishments and Tarbell's was my last stop of the day.  It was actually closed on the day that I arrived to check it out so I just looked through the windows into the restaurant and when I saw their semi-private partial glass enclosed dining room, I knew this was the place.  On the day of the event, we had two vegetarians in our party and that was not a problem at all (I think their food was actually the best).  Instead of getting an entree, my son ordered three sides and he was completely happy w/his meal.  I recall having the raspberry mojitos and chocolate martini and both were sensational.  Dessert was also top notched and to make the experience even sweeter, Mark Tarbell came by to congratulate us and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to host our special event.  From beginning to end, our meals felt like it was taking us on a culinary adventure.  Service was also excellent and everyone in the party agreed that we'd come to a very special place indeed.  I've been back to Tarbell's on a couple more occasions since then (always w/guests in tow) and the experience has always been the same...everyone leaves completely happy.  This is a very memorable place and I would come here more frequently if it wasn't so far from my house.

Been here on numerous occasions (both lunch & dinner) and have never been disappointed.  There is a wider selection at dinner...but the lunch price is almost 1/2 that of dinner and the selection is still huge.  Every time we come here...I swear to try something at every station...but there are just too many.  You do feel like you're at a Vegas casino buffet or on a cruise.  Some of the items are really good while others are mediocre...but for the value & selection, everyone is bound to find a boatload of things they'll like.  This is a good place to go when you're 1) super hungry and can eat a cow, 2) like having a large selection to chose from, or 3) w/a group that can't decide to do Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian or Vietnamese.  This place has it all and something for everyone!

This place has been on our to-do list for over a year before we finally made it here...and I could have kicked myself for waiting so long!  Upon arrival, we were immediately taken w/the place.  The grounds were beautiful and we truly felt like we've "left town" and was at someplace else.  There is usually a line for breakfast but once you sign in you can walk the grounds and garden or sit on the outside patio (in front of the other restaurant that's only open for dinner).  This place is also dog friendly and if you get a drink from the bakery up front, you can refill it at the cafe when you sit down for breakfast.  When we come here, we always go for the French Toast and something else.  Have you ever had something so good that it ruins it for you to get it anywhere else?  This is what their French Toast did to me...from that moment on...all French Toasts will be compared to this one.  The bread they use is super light and fluffy, sprinkled w/toasted pecan & served w/warm & silky maple syrup.  It's really simple...yet so unbelievably delicious.  We usually also get some sort of egg breakfast and they've been pretty good.  Their potatoes are also good and I always request mine extra crispy like my bacon.  Another plus is they have fresh-squeezed OJ and the service is always prompt, courteous and mindful.

I've been going to Mido Sushi for about 3 years + and the food is consistently good and the prices are unbeatable.  In addition to the $19.99 all-you-can-eat sushi (w/some exceptions) they have great lunch specials and happy hours.  I also like the fact that they treat everyone to edamame, miso soup & a house salad.  Although the sushi chefs are pretty friendly and personable...on most of my visits, the waitresses have ranged from brisk to downright exasperated (one even rolled her eyes at me because I asked for tempura sauce and she brought me eel sauce and I had to ask again for tempura sauce).  Overall, based on food and value, I would recommend this place.

7 of us went there for lunch last week...and everyone loved their meal from beginning to end.  We all got the $11.50 lunch special, which came w/veggie spring rolls, a yummy soup (which had chicken) an entree of your choice, and fried bananas spring rolls for dessert.  The Pad Thai was one of the best that I've had here in the valley.  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I also tried the spicy eggplant w/tofu and it was also very good (although there was almost zero spice flavor).  The pad kee mao was also excellent.  Several ppl had the yellow curry and they cleaned their plates.  The only thing is that they didn't ask any of us how spicy we wanted our food.  When two ppl in our party told them that they wanted theirs "Thai" spicy...they laughed and made jokes about whether they know what they were asking for.  When their food arrived...it wasn't as spicy as they'd like and they weren't offered a side of chili to add in additional spices.  Overall, the food was very good, service was attentive and the ambiance was chic & bright.  Would def come back and highly recommend...only be aware that you'll need to ask for extra chili on the side if you like your food w/any level of spiciness at all.

Been to this location many times (both lunch & dinner) and the food is always good and filling.  I'm a huge fan of Indian food (both north & south) and this place is right up my alley.  Great food, great prices, speedy service...and always made to feel welcome by the friendly lady behind the counter.  I've even ordered food from here for a company luncheon event and everyone loved it.  Have taken many out-of-town guests here and everyone is always impressed w/the food.  I've been to many other Indian restaurants around the valley...but this is the one I always come back to.  The following are some of my favorites from this restaurant:  curry eggplant palak paneer malai kofta vegetable manchurian naan dosa

Ever since I moved here from the OC (where I've been super spoiled when it comes to good Pho)...I've been on an unsuccessful quest to find good Pho.  Pho is not something I want to eat on a regular basis...but there are days when I just want a good bowl of Pho and it's frustrating when I have to drive around and settle for something mediocre.  I wanted to come here about a month back but they were closed on the day I wanted to come (again, I was having some Pho craving issues).  But today was my lucky day because all the stars lined up and here we are at Pho Van!  Walking in, the restaurant felt really open, clean and inviting.  The people running the place were friendly and attentive.  I did notice prices were a little on the high side for a Pho joint.  We got the Pho Dac Biet and found the broth steaming hot and perfectly seasoned.  There was plenty of noodles and ample amount of meat w/a nice dish of very fresh herbs & veggies.  The only thing I wasn't thrilled w/was the obvious lack of tripe (which was my favorite thing in the Pho)...I didn't really find any and I had to read the menu again to be sure that it was included as part of the description.  The second thing I wasn't impressed w/was the beef/meatballs...they were kinda on the hard & dense side and wasn't plump & juicy.  We also got the house special Bun Rieu...and again, the broth was steaming hot and perfectly seasoned and tasty.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see escargot (which I love) in it...even if it was on the chewy side (lucky for me, I'm okay w/my escargots being chewy...although the boyfriend didn't care for them that way).  One thing that prevented this bowl from getting 5 stars is the shrimp cakes/dumplings in this noodle (which is suppose to be the highlight of the meal) was completely lacking in shrimps...it was disappointingly made up mostly of ground pork w/just a hint of shrimp.  Maybe I'm just being really particular because I've searched and waited so long for a restaurant w/this much promise to come along.  Overall, the food was really good and I would def go back and I do highly recommend this place to friends and family.

Another spot that I tried out w/a girlfriend prior to our little shopping spree.  The chicken was delicious and the waffles were also good.  I didn't think the waffles were especially phenomenal but together they worked well along w/the syrup.  What I actually enjoyed most was the eggs w/cheese & onions that came w/our meal...they were some of the yummiest eggs I've had in a long time.  I also ordered an extra side of collard greens since I love collard greens and what's eating at a soul food restaurant w/o trying the greens?  I found them to be entirely too sweet & spicy...I couldn't detect any other flavor beside the sweet & spicy and I didn't find them too appetizing.  The staff was friendly and easy-going and we even chatted up our neighbors at the next table.

This was another one of those place where everyone tells you you must try out NOW...so I came here w/several friends for lunch last week.  The restaurant is pretty much standard Chinese hole-in-the-wall...nothing remarkable.  It wasn't packed but had a good lunch crowd there.  The waitress was also nice & polite and came by a couple of times to see if we were ready to order (since it was our first time, we didn't immediately know what we wanted upon arriving).  When ordering noodles, they have a list of about 5-6 different types of noodles...first you pick your noodles, then you pick how you wanted it prepped...pretty neat.  I got the beef stew w/the wide noodles and it was so wide I had a hard time eating it.  Each noodle strand was almost an inch wide so it wasn't easy trying to stick it all in my mouth.  I should have stayed w/my original thought of getting the hand pulled noodle...and will get it the next time I'm there.  Although the wide noodle was slightly difficult for me to eat, the beef stew & the pickled greens that came w/it were really good.  I also had the boba milk tea and it was okay.  Complete lunch for me came out to ~$10...I was a happy camper  :)  There are also several vegetarian options so our vegan friends weren't left hungry.  Our friends' vegetarian noodle plates came out to only $4/each...what a deal!  They felt their meal was very satisfying and we shall be back.
