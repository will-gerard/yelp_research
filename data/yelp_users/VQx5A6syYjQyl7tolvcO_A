Wow, I can't believe how bad the food here tastes. Too much minced raw galic in their food. I'm the biggest garlic fan but this was just wrong. Probably last time ordering anything from here. Sorry for the negative review but is was bad..

Service was ok, but the food has no flavor. We ordered salmon and tuna. Salmon was fishy and the tuna was very off. Come here if you want to feel disappointed and ripped off when walking out.

Brought my fam here. The burgers were good but I wouldn't go craving this place. It's an establishment where I would visit once every year or two just for convenience.

Came for some Vietnamese cuisine but was thrown off and confused with there menu and high Glendale prices.

Yolanda is right. These guys need to get better before competition takes all their customers. I do NOT recommend!!!!!!!
