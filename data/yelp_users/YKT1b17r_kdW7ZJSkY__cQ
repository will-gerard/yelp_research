Loved the happy hour and cute atmosphere here! Happy hour ends at 6 so be sure to come by. We got tofu steak, rainbow roll, salmon sashimi and crunchy roll for a total of $19! Definitely get the salmon sashimi. It was a great deal for only $6, generous servings and the salmon was buttery and delicious. The crunchy roll was only $3 and was great deal, it wasn't the best but it was great for the price and serving.   Service was great and they even let us bring in milk tea from Snoh next door. I would love to come back during happy hour and try the other deals. Even the regular menu seemed pretty cheap, ramen is only priced arond $6-7.

Best duck curry I've ever had. The duck is tender and juicy. The sauce was flavorful, tangy and very tasty. Rice is included! I got the large and shared with another. Definitely recommend this dish!  Minus 1 star just because I got the Thai iced tea and it was watery. Wasn't as sweet as I wanted.  Service is also great!

I've been looking for a decent coffee shop around Mesa to do some studying and unfortunely still have not found it in The Coffee Shop. The store is trendy and spacious but came off as more of a sit down and eat cafe rather than a study place. First off there are no outlets in the main dining room so you have to go to a fairly dark room in the back to find outlets. Instead of tables though, it's filled with sofas so it's even harder to stay awake. The wifi is fairly choppy too so it kicks you off every so often, with a big suggestion that they don't recommend you staying on for more than 2 hours.   But if you're not looking for a place to study, the coffee shop is good for chit chat and food. There is plenty of room to sit, talk and catch up with friends. There is also a nice patio outside.  I ordered a vanilla cupcake after hearing that they were on cupcake wars back in 2010. The frosting was sweet and creamy. My only complaint was that the interior seemed a bit dry. It's a fairly big cupcake for $3 though, perfect for sharing.  I would return again to try out all the delicious items I saw on the menu and just catch up with friends on the nice patio outside. However studying for a long period of time is probably not a good idea here.

I've been looking for a good boba place since I moved to Mesa 6 months ago. I finally found one! The green tea milk is one of my favorite drinks here. The drink prices range from $3-4 for very good portion cups. It's located next to Mojo Yogurt and within Tempe Marketplace. Good place to study for the day and then take a break and go shopping!

Service is a bit slow but understandable with only 1 barista. Place is a little cramped and small but plenty of plugs available! Barista is nice and friendly.   But more importantly, this place has the best iced mocha I've had in Arizona.

Tip: When it says 3.99 a la carte, it's actually only 1 taco. Only the taco plate has 2 tacos. We made that mistake and our bill ended up tripling in price.   On a brighter note, the horchata was fantastic! This is the first time I've seen horchata filled with so much fruit and it was such a large size, perfect for sharing. We ordered the slow cooked pork taco and I thought it was a little too messy. I enjoyed the fish tacos the most, light and crispy.  Also loved the extensive salsa bar and the fact there is cilantro salsa!

I had a bad experience the first time at smashboxx but decided to give it another try on Friday....it was worse. First of all I don't understand why guys only have to pay cover.. it's not Vegas.  Second of all, the staff is rude.  One of my friends was just dancing  and he got physically manhandled and kicked out for just dancing...and another got head locked for trying to follow the other friend.  Really? Isn't there a nicer way to kick someone out then using violence when there was no retaliation at all?? It looked at 1 point like physical assault from the bouncers.   I'm never going again unless they change up the bouncers... If you go, be careful how you dance, they might think you're drunk and manhandle you

So many things to love about Snoh. First off, I really enjoy the modern decorations and paintings. The interior feels so different from everything else in Arizona - hipster and modern. There are even board games and cards to entertain yourself with. Along the lines of modernity, Snoh seems to always be experimenting with new creations and recipes. The first time I came they only had milk tea and shaved ice. 3 months later they had brick toast and now they have another new dessert. Innovation and a growing menu are always a plus for my taste palate.   Five stars for the milk tea! In my opinion - best milk tea in Arizona! It has enough sweetness without tasting like syrup! The portions are also great for the price. They even have a stamp card for all milk tea addicts out there.  I always drop by Snoh if I'm in Phoenix and it has happily satisfied my cravings everytime!

Every chipotle has the same food but it's just the service that distinguishes them. This one had terrible service and horrible wait time. I waited 20 mins for a bowl when the line wasn't even long. The food was made haphazardly and they constantly ran out of things so it took forever. Worst chipotle I've ever been to.  Worst part, the corn was frozen in my bowl -___-

Service is awesome here. There's always a friendly face and they constantly come around to check on how you're doing. Last time I went, the chef even came out to ask my opinion on the dessert. I also love the decor here, modern, clean and hip!  I have gone twice and ordered Paitan broth which was scrumptious. I have friends who hate broth and still drank it all because it was so flavorful. Remember to add cracklings to your soup; it adds a nice crunch! I got the pork belly as well and just wished it had a little more fat to it.   I love this place but I do think the price can get a bit steep. The basic bowl of noodles is $8 but each additional topping is extra. With such an extensive list of extras, it's hard not to end up with a $11+ bowl of ramen.

I'm a huge fan of boiling crab so I'm always on the lookout for anything similar when I'm away. This hits as close to home as possible. I got the 1 lb shrimp, trifecta and mild. I know I shouldn't compare to boiling crab, but it's always my baseline for seafood nowadays. The sauce is great, lacks a little bit of flavor compared to BC, and has a little too much pepper. The other issue is that the sauce is too oily. The oil seems to seep through the bag and all over the table. So if you go, really prepare to dig your hands through some oil.   We also ordered the po'boy sliders which were delicious! One of my fav things about Anrgry Crab Shack are the delicious fries, make sure to get those along with your seafood meal. Service is also outstanding here. Everyone is friendly and helpful!  So I guess my minus 1 star is the fact the sauce is too oily and the sauce just needs a little more flavor.

I'm originally from the bay area and there was an Ike's 15 mins away from me that I religiously went to. So when I saw an Ike open in Mesa I was unbeliveably excited! I got my usual, the Menage a Trois and it definitely tasted like home. Each sandwich is made with some type of crack sauce because it all becomes very addicting. Fortunately they said delivery might not be too far off in the feature!  What set this Ike's apart was definitely the service though. The manager was amazing, considerate and very helpful. We ordered 8 sandwiches and she packaged each one seperately for us, put in individual reciepts and even labeled each one with hearts. She made the whole experience enjoyable and easy. I am definitely going back again!

I happened to stumble upon this place on a Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 16oz Buzz and it was delicious! Tasted natural and healthy, didn't taste any preservatives or frozen junk like many other juice places. I usually hate carrot juice but the combo of carrot and the other ingredients made it delicious and refreshing. I'll def return and try the other juices on the menu.

I was so excited to see a Lo Lo's after I got off the plane. However I was super disappointed it didn't taste like the original at all. The lemonade has always been a favorite at Lo-Lo's but it was so watered down - didn't taste good at all. The chicken salad had basically 2 handfuls of salad mix with couple pieces of chicken. It was definitely not worth the price.  The mac and cheese was dried up and stuck together.  The only part of the order I liked was the corn bread even though it was cold. If you are expecting to come here for the experience, you are in for a disappointment! Service was slow and took 20 minutes and they  even forgot my waffle.   I'm sad because Lo-Lo's would have been great to showcase what Arizona has to offer for tourists at the airport but this particular store def does do not do that!
