I own my own business, and it's nice to know that I can get my packages out quick and easy. Every time I go here I am in and out in less than a 5 minutes. They also do faxes, notary, and have mailboxes too!

I was referred to Village Electric from a trusted mechanic that I have used for years. The customer service they provide is top notch. I called in to check if they could help fix my car as the problem was beyond my mechanics capability.   The girl who answered the phone was very professional and did a great job. She explained that she would check with the technician and let me know shortly if they could take care of the problem.    After just a short time she called back and said that they would be able to take care of it and could even get me in that day!   I dropped off the car and within 24 hrs they diagnosed and fixed the problem. I was very impressed with Mark ( the tech ) who was able to get my car back in tip top shape!   I highly recommend working with this company they are honest and do a great job!   Thank you all for running a great business I will certainly use you all in the future!

We had a great time getting to know the owner Swani. She and her husband shared how they have been in business here in Tempe for almost 40 years. The food and service are top knotch! They were even nice enough to accommodate our huge party of 30 people.  Thank you for the great service and amazing food. We will be back again for sure.

I recently moved to the Farm House Meadows right down the street from the Gilbert Zipps. I was excited when I came for the first time last Sunday! The bar tender was great, the patrons were friendly, and the food was delicious! I had such a good time playing pool, shuffle board, and hanging out I came back Monday with one of the guys on my Landscaping Team! We had such a great time we stayed from 7-11 shooting pool, playing music on the juke box, and enjoying a large meal! Our server Tanya, was amazing she had a huge section to attend to, but did such an amazing job that you would have thought we were her only table.  With the above said, my mind was blown when Sebastian (the same person who was there with me Monday) and I returned Thursday! While I went to the quarter machine to make change for pool and the juke box, the server informed Sebastian that he needed to be 21 yrs of age to shoot pool at that time or even be in the restaurant. He told me about the rule which we were unaware of. We were hungry and ready to eat, and bummed out cause we rode our bikes there. I asked to speak to the manager to ask if he could make an exception and allow us to eat dinner on the patio, out of the bar area. He informed me of the strict company policy that he needed to adhere to and that there was no way we could stay.   At that point I understood the policy and respected the rules. I politely asked to have  the 15 dollars in quarters I had got exchanged for cash (as I rode my bike and did want to loose the coins on the ride home). He then rudely said, "I would have to roll all those quarters, and I don't have time for that." I said are you kidding me?!!! And he said yes I can't make change for those quarters unless YOU roll them for us! At that point I lost my cool and was very frustrated. I told the manager I would take my business elsewhere and would never be back again! He just said ok and walked into his office.... Wow my mind was blown!!!  Our server from the other night Tanya, observed my frustration with the manager, and asked what happened? I told her and she on her own time, as she had just clocked out, took my quarters, apologized for the manager and said I hope you guys do come back!   I highly doubt that we will be back! But if we do come back it won't be on the Thursday night managers shift!!!    I'm not sure, but maybe you should start "making time" for customer service, because I don't have time for that B.S.!!!!!!!

Every time I go into this store they can't pull up the parts I need for my 2001 Chevy Silverado. I would understand them not being able to locate the parts for a rare custom build, but a Chevy Silverado???  Please update your computer system.

Despite the poor reviews I came to in and out to get my motor cycle title and registration. Jay who was working the window was very personable and helpful! He did a great job working the counter and even multitasked taking calls and helping customers since they were a staff member down. There was a $18 convenience fee but I mentioned yelp and got a $3 dollar discount.   Well worth the time I saved rather waiting in line at the DMV. I certainly will use this place in the future and appreciate the good service. Looks like they have been making some positive changes.   Thanks for the help and doing a great job Jay!! Keep up the good work!!!!

Cory, Mary, Gus, and the whole team are amazing. This shop is top rate, and keeps all our equipment running excellent. After I bring in my lawn mowers, blowers, chainsaws in to be tuned they are done in a timely manner. I trust them with all of our equipment and don't go anywhere else.   They also have a great selection of new and used equipment for any professional landscaper or home owner. Check them out off Az ave South of Guadalupe. Thanks Cory and team for the great job you always do!  Jeremy Cahill Cahill Landscaping LLC

If you want a place to get your car washed fast and for a great price then this is the spot. They have free vacuums and plenty of them so you're not waiting around. I'm not usually in this area, but just happened to swing by and I'm glad I did.   Thanks for doing a great job, and if I'm back in the area I'll surely swing through again.

I highly recommend All Terrain Landscaping! Adam and Natalie have a great eye for detail and they are meticulous about quality. They are reliable, honest, and do a great job every time. Their commitment to quality and knowledge of the industry are two reasons that I team up with them on jobs regularly.   Adam and his team do a great deal of landscaping, design, and install for us when we are booked a couple months in advance. It's great to have a business that I can refer to other's and can be confident that they will deliver the highest quality results.  Keep up the good work guys!
