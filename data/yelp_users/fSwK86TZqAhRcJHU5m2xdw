Ordered a takeout order online to be ready at 7:55 show up at 8:00 to pick it up and they were just putting it in the oven... It was ready at 8:20. They didn't even apologize. Overpriced for such bad service. I won't be eating here again.

I got the Moo Goo Gai Peng and the House Special Lo Mein as take away.  It was great!  I was also excited to hear they deliver to my place so I'll be ordering them for delivery in the future.

I found this company here on Yelp and went with it because of all the high reviews.  This company deserves them!  They did a one time treatment for sewer roaches and while they were here also found termites and showed me where they were.  They were able to treat them with a one time fix instead of trying to sell me monthly treatments.  This is not a company that pushes sales they just do what you ask them to and they do it well.  I would recommend them to anyone having a sewer roach problem or termite problem.

Deborah, the owner, is great, she was very professional and worked with me every way she could to make sure I was taken care of.  I had a leak from my second floor shower and it came through the ceiling.  She tested everything and followed up with me throughout the process to make sure I understood what was going on.  If I ever have a mold problem again she will be the one I call.
