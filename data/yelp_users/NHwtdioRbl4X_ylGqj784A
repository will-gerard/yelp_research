This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Phoenix so far. Let me break down:  The service was terrible. The ingredients in the salad weren't fully explained and when it came out I realized I hate multiple items on it.. I tried to find the server, but she never came back. My date had to awkwardly half eat, half wait for me. By the time she came back - she just wanted to clear the plates. She did bring out a different salad - but I was charged for both.  Our entrees were mediocre at best. Steaks that were over-cooked and under marinated.   We were given a birthday dessert that was nicely decorated, but then we were charged for that as well. This isn't actually a big deal, but I've never had to pay for celebration dessert at any restaurant before. The Olive Garden gives you a free cake for crying out loud.  That being said, the place has a cool concept. The spinning room in downtown is really cool. If you really must check it out - just grab a drink. The food is expensive, terrible, and will be served to you in an un-timely and unfriendly manner.

Food was pretty good but the service was terrible. Server was unprofessional and came back after everyone had paid and asked for a better tip. I've been in the service industry for 8 years and have never ever seen such a thing. Will not be returning.

We had a great time here. It was a fun atomopshere, the food came out very quickly, and our server Toby went above and beyond to make everything wonderful.

I've been to Sweet Tomatoes a few times and I have to say, I like the new changes they're making.  The whole look on the inside is different - and in a good way. I like the new decor right when you walk in. It's a nice change, and makes everything look more modern and fresh.  As far as the food goes, I also like the new additions. I had the rotisserie chicken and the creamed corn and both were pretty darn good.  Overall - it's nice to see them evolving and changing things up.
