Always friendly, always knows my drink. Quiet and plenty of outlets for road warriors like me.

$99 brakes special is a total ripoff intended to get you to pay for expensive repairs. I decline service and tell them I will have a friend to check and if necessary repairs and pay for $99 "special' THEN they tell me if I do this on my own it voids the warranty and lifetime replacement. TOTAL BULL.  Just Brakes...Just Stinks!!!

Great service and excellent repairs.  Had to bring in my car after my car was hit. Rick and his staff handled all the communication with the insurance company, kept me up to date every step of the way and as a bonus, got me a great deal on new brakes.  For above and beyond service, its Chandler Auto Body.

Dad's dinner secret.   Avoided this for years because I thought it was Pizza Hut's wings but 6 months ago we check it out and it's a winner.  My kids love the teriyaki wings but my favorite are the Hawaiian WIngs. The fries are great and a Dos XX while I wait for takeout is always a good thing :)

Non corporate coffee  Solo cafe has become my new favorite place to have my cup of joe and work.   Ty makes a rockin americano or cappucino and they have a great variety of teas and some awesome pastries.   The vibe in the place is very cool with awesome artwork and cool tunes in the background - no muzak.  It is also not too loud and has free and easy wifi and outlets everywhere. Might just trade in my gold starbucks card.

I was so hopeful for a comeback....but it didn't happen  After terrible service and great pizza last time we went, my wife and mother in law returned for lunch and had a terribly overcooked, dry and tasteless chicken parmigiana sandwich. They brought some home assuming I would eat anything but could not eat this.  Off the radar for a while.

Redemption for Sandbar Chandler.  After a less than pleasant experience our first time at Sandbar, GM Bill Hovey and staff truly put the customer first.  Bill saw my complaint and immediately left two voicemails, an emall and eventually invited me and my wife for lunch today via facebook.  We were greeted by the very pleasant Jen as we walked in. Our waiter was very pleasant and funny without being too over the top.  We started off with chips and a great trio of salsa and cheese dip. My wife had a very tasty burrito and my ahi and shrimp tacos had a great combo of spicy and sweet. (FYI Tuesday is $2 tacos).  We finished off with fried ice cream with fresh pineapples. A tasty end to the meal and the beginning of my food coma.  In a time when you hear more excuses than accountability, Sandbar Chandler was a refreshing change.  They are back on my radar. Thanks Bill.

Don't Try this Thai!  For the first time in weeks my wife got to have dinner without the kids and decided to got out for on of our favorites, Thai and try a new place -- Bad Idea.  We ordered tofu soup, BBQ chicken and green beans with shrimp from a very nervous waiter who was obviously very new. We order unsweetened iced tea to drink. We specifically asked to have the soup FIRST.  Five minutes later waiter comes back and says that are out of Tea. No Tea in an Asian restaurant? REALLY?  Twenty five minutes later we finally see the waiter and wave him over. I ask him about the soup and remind him we want it BEFORE the meal. Five minutes later we get the soup....with no bowls of silverware (another waiter get them for us) ONE MINUTE after we get our soup we get our meal!   By the way, the tofu soup...HAD NO TOFU!  Despite getting the meal with the soup against our wishes, we pressed on. Unfortunately they gave us the wrong shrimp dish. It took us five minutes to explain to what appeared to be the owner/managers wife the mistake and another ten minutes to get the right dish.  We try to eat the BBQ chicken but it was so dry I actually got into a five minute choaking fit...No one came to see if I was OK OR fill my water glass that was EMPTY FOR 10 MINUTES!  After waiting and looking to get the check we finally get it from the nervous waiter.... but it include the Iced Tea they were out of so we waited 10 minutes for him to ask him to remove that charge from the bill. 15 MINUTES LATER they come back with the proper bill!!  My normally calm and understanding wife finally asked to speak to a manager. The older asian lady came out and told us the manager was not in and proceeded to blame the kitchen for all the mistakes and said "I am only one person, I cannot do everything"  Frustrated we left our table. I noticed a older Asian man walking around the restaurant so I asked him if he was the owner/manger and he said yes he was. I began to explain our issues with dinner and service, he incredibly lost his ability to speak english. We left vowing to never to return again.  The old Asian lady did give us a generous 10% discount on our bill. That and the fact that I left a ZERO tip for the first time in my life made the meal inexpensive. I'll give them 2 stars for that LOL  The owners should fire everyone, close the doors and find new careers.  **UPDATE**  After seeing this review, the owner's son sent me a note saying he was sorry and offering me a free meal once they have their staffing issues resolved. I refused the free meal but said I would come back once resolved and if better, I would update the review.  Stay Tuned.

Academy of Scuba recently became a client of mine so I thought a scuba lesson would be in order.   Tania, Martha and the staff were friendly, professional and very easy to learn from and create a great learning environment.  Great place to learn and fall in love with Scuba

Oregano's is the Bomb  When I posted that I was going to Oregano's for the first time, the post above was one of several very positive recommendations so I was encouraged...and fortunately.  From the very beginning, the staff was very friendly and attentive.  I had their thin crust pizza with tomatoes on top (forgot the name) which was excellent... a big deal coming from a NY pizza snob. Then my guest and I shared a delicious, giant and warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  Our waitress was first class and even made sure our giant to go cups were filled to the top before we left.  I will be back with family, friends and business partners soon

Mellow Mushroom - WOW  As you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade. Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.  We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome. The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it. I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked.  Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off.  I'll be heading back...soon

Don't go on a rainy Saturday!  Normally a good place for a treat, it failed this Saturday. They had four yogurt machines empty and all the fruit containers. We mentioned this loud enough for the staff person to hear but got no action.  Keep the quality up.

Went here for lunch with my client, Academy of Scuba and had an outstanding burger. The marinara burger was incredible and the tots were amazing. They gotta franchise this place. Yum!

Went there for the first time. Food was pretty good but not good enough for the real slow service and the completely arrogant and rude owner. I prefer to to have my pizza without a side of **shole.
