Went to Snooze this morning around 1000 with my dog, Bubba. We sat outside which, in this heat, was a questionable decision but with Bubba along for the ride we didn't have a choice. We were seated on the back patio in the shade and it was actually pretty nice! Our server promptly provided a water bowl for bubba and took our orders. We both made a couple of changes to our order and the server was happy to accommodate us. I had the egg scramble with bacon and sub'd the toast for a sweet potato pancake with blueberries. Food came out quickly and was delicious. Honestly I don't know what else to say. It was a great meal with great service. 5 stars!

I'm here from out of town so I couldn't visit my usual detailer. I talked with the attendant and we agreed on a wash, wax, interior detailing with carpet shampoo and scent. When I picked the car up (had been waiting inside for them to call me but they never did. Went outside to check and they said it had been done for a while) it definitely didn't meet expectations but I had to go. Upon further inspection, there are the following shortcomings: - still have bug guts on the paint and grill - headlights still have some sort of wax or cleaned on them that was never buffed off (pic) - the running boards are now scuffed whereas they weren't when I came in. So somehow they made that worse (pic) - the pilar between the dash and roof is scuffed (pic) - none of the interior windows were cleaned (there was a large dog nose mark on the back window that was untouched)  All in all, they managed to make my car dirtier than it was when I came in. One star.
