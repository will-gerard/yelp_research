I paid almost $10 for a steak and guacamole bowl and the meat was lukewarm. I came in at 3:45 pm on Super Bowl Sunday. They offered to remake it (with the same batch, I'm sure) and had to ask for a refund. They did not seem apologetic and kept serving the steak to other customers. Poor form. By far the worst chipotle I've been to, and the reviews reflect it. Look in to new management.

I went in for a pedicure and brow waxing.  The brow waxing came first with only minimal pain and redness.  The classic spa pedicure was very relaxing and came with a much-needed cuticle scrub.  I received one of the best massages at a salon.   Very clean, professional, and they have a wall of really cute shoes!  They also made sure I was comfortable the whole time.  Also, they offer a lot services including: facials, waxing (even Brazilians), specialty manicures/pedicures, and body wraps.

This first experience has been fantastic. My brother received a FREE large one-topping pizza for his bday. Be sure to come at 4:45 for your pizza from a freshly stoked oven. Perfectly cooked with fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce. The Caesar and caprese salads were a great starter. We'll be returning for the great pie! Don't forget the tiramisu.
