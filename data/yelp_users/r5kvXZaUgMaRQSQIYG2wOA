DO NOT RENT HERE!!  I have had only issue after issue in the year I have been here.  I move out on Sunday.  Thank Goodness!! I'm sitting here right now with no running water & as always the office is not returning my call. Last week the AC was not working for almost 5 days.  My apt was 100 degrees.   The office doesn't care & the maintenance crew is rude. I've had consistent issues since move in with plumbing, AC and inconsiderate neighbors. Stay far far away from this place!!!!!

Just a quick review.  Lunch was yummy.  :)  I really wanted to talk about customer service.  Christina is an amazing hostess!!  I wanted to say Thank you!   I think it is easy for some people to forget that service matters!  It was a wonderful experience!
