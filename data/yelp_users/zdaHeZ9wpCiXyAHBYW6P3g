We used to order here all the time but lately it hasn't been as good as it used to be. Most recently, we called to order pizza for delivery and were asked cash or card. We told them card as usual and the response was "our servers are down so can you pay with cash? If not, we can't help you."   We didn't have cash and of course don't expect free pizza...  But the attitude of the girl on the phone was extremely rude. Won't be returning.

This place is a few minutes from our house so my boyfriend and I tend to come a lot. It has a very "local" feel to it which I like. Their "Cave Creek" salad is delicious and literally EVERY dish is MASSIVE. Do not come here unless you're starving or else you will bring half of your order home with you.   They're one of the only places that we have found that sell "two harded ale" ... A Michigan beer which is my bfs fav. As long as we live near by we will come and come again.

What a disappointment! Went to Vegas with a group of my friends and decided to make this our evening dining location.   The food was okay. Nothing special considering the price. This review is really for the terrible service we experienced.   We were a party of 8 which included 4 couples. The guys sat on one side across from their girlfriends. After we ordered, but before we got our food, my friend asked if our server, Jesip (Josip.. Can't really remember which since I barely saw him) if he could split the check into the four couples. He very rudely goes "would have been nice to know this beforehand", walked away and literally stopped being our server.   After that our water cups were empty the rest of the meal because he did not come by again. We had to tip him because gratuity was included with our large party. I wanted so badly to cross the gratuity off the check and ask the manager to adjust the bill without it.

My boyfriend and I came here last night with some friends that were in town from Minnesota and once again this place didn't let me down!   My favorite part of Olive & Ivy has got to be the stunning patio! Seriously, don't even bother sitting inside. The patio is worth it even in the middle of the AZ summer heat, thats how pretty it is. I always get the Margarita Flat Bread and it is to die for. My boyfriend gets the Veil and Spinach Ravioli and loves it every time as well (I can't vouch for this one though, seeing as Veil is not my thing).  I have only ever had one issue with any food I have tasted here and that was my starter from last night. I chose to start with a cup of their soup of the day - Broccoli Cheddar. I don't know about you, but when I envision Broccoli Cheddar Soup, I envision orange, cheesy soup with a ton of chunks of Broccoli. The consistency of this soup could be compared to water, no chunks of broccoli and was green! I have never seen green broccoli cheddar soup. Honestly think they just pureed broccoli together, added water and a little bit of cheese and called it a day. I would definitely pass on this next time it is available.   Other than that, our guests loved the suggestion and we loved it to. Will be back time and time again!

My boyfriend and I had a reservation here Sunday night with a few of our out of town friends. This was my first time at Ocean Club seeing as we normally go to City Hall behind Fashion Square. Let me tell you, Ocean Club lived up to the Mastros name!   All four of us ordered steaks and they all were cooked to perfection. The mac n cheese (a favorite of mine) and the asparagus were the perfect sides and of course, how could I have forgotten the pretzel bread to start (delish!)   I just have one minor complaint. I always order the petite filet and, in the past, it was always an 8 oz for $40. However, I guess Mastros just started selling the petite filet in a 6oz (trust me, the 2 extra oz make a huge difference when it comes to filling up your stomach). You can order the 8oz for, I dont know, I think $10+ -, which is the smallest complaint. But I mean, I'm already paying $40 ... why should I have to pay an extra $10 for what I normally always get??   Anywho... we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back without question.

This place gets 5 stars simply because it's an Alabama bar in Scottsdale. ROLL TIDE.    ..... Thier bean dip and queso are on point as well.

I know it's McDonalds so I shouldn't expect much but this location was such a disappointment.   Short and simple: I asked for large fries and got medium. Not that big of a deal because I looked at my receipt and only paid for medium so whatever. But I love ketchup. Seriously, I could swim in ketchup. She only gave me ONE ketchup packet for all those fries... So I asked if I could have a few more. She then gives me, again, only ONE more packet (and looked extremely annoyed while doing so).   Dirty woman's bathroom too. Not good customer service.

One of my favorite places for happy hour in old town!   My boyfriend and I come all the time. Their cornbread is to die for. Seriously it's the best corn bread in all the land (or at least this side of the Mississippi).   We always split the Tejas Trio and a side southwestern Caesar salad. Service is always great and we love to sit on the patio. We tend to usually have the same server as well who recognizes us every time which is another plus.   Also, their strawberry mojito deserves 5 stars on it's own. Sadly, it's not part of their happy hour menu but still freaking delicious!

Let me start off my saying that I HATE the dentist but I LOVE Simply Dentistry!   I am a Diet Coke addict. Seriously, I drink up to 8 a day. Needless to say I don't take care of my teeth as much as I should.   In March I had really bad tooth pain. It turns out a root canal I had done in high school (I'm 23 now) was infected in a root my previous dentist had forgotten about when doing the original procedure. I was in excruciating pain and had just moved to the PHX area in January so I didn't have a dentist.  I turned to Yelp and boy did it not let me down! Dr. Tran and the Simply Dentistry team got me in the next day (they area always booked becuase they are that good so getting me in the next day was not an easy task),  were very aware of the amount of pain I was in and took extra effort to take care of me.   Before going to Simply Dentistry I hadn't been to the dentist since January of 2011. Now I have already left and come back again for a second cleaning!   For anyone afraid of the dentist or weary of finding one, seriously look no further! The ENTIRE Simply Dentistry team is easily the nicest, most professional dental team I have ever had the pleasure of being a patient to.   No doubt in my mind - 5 STARS

The food was pretty good... Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but seeing as it is an airport restaurant I can't complain.   This review is mainly for our sever, Carol. She was the BEST! Super nice and attentive. My favorite thing though, was when I asked if their key lime pie was good (my favorite dessert) she gave me an honest answer and told me no. Servers survive on tips. Ideally, the bigger the meal, the higher the tip. By telling me the truth about the key lime pie she risked a lesser tip for honest service. LOVE that! If you go here.. Make sure you ask for her.   (And to clarify, she definitely got a higher tip than she probably would have gotten if I had ordered the pie :))

I just started a new job and stumbled upon this JJs location less than 5 minutes from my office so I stopped here for lunch today.   I get an hour for lunch and since I'm always paranoid about being late anywhere I decided JJs "freaky fast" subs would be the way to go. They seriously stick to their motto don't they? Between the time I ordered to the time I finished filling up my water cup, my sub was already waiting for me.   Honesty, I was impressed. Being in an incredibly business (office) heavy location, I know they probably get slammed for lunch... and today was no different. There's a large selection of tables inside and every one of them was filled... yet every sandwich seemed to come out "freaky fast" anyway.  I'm knocking one star for the presentation of my sandwich. Coming to this type of establishment, I know I can't expect much in terms of look, however, I had to shove the majority of my sandwich insides back in as I was eating since they were practically out of the bread to begin with. Still timely and delicious none the less.

My new "must have" Vegas stop! My boyfriend showed me this gem and all I could think of was how many Vegas trips I've been on in which my taste buds have missed out!   It's hidden down a hallway in this elegant Vegas hotel, then you turn the corner and it's like you're in a greasy New York pizzeria. I don't really know what makes it so good, but boy is it delicious.

SUCH a great show! I come to Vegas for the shows more so than the gambling.   This did not disappoint! The music might be stuck in my head for years... But it was well worth it.
