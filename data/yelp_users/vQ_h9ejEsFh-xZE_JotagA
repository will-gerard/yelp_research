I went to The Melting Pot for the first time a couple weeks ago on a double date. Ambiance was wonderful and dessert fondue was absolutely amazing. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because the expense- although I do not mind paying for good food, I do not like the attitude that sometimes go with high-class places. At one point, I felt as though I was not spoken to in an adult-like way despite us all being above legal drinking age. Perhaps it was because we look the part of 'college kids'. Overall, I'm willing to try again- it may have just been a bad night for that particular waitress.

Oh gosh, what a place this is! The only I liked about this place was the little aerobics room- i would use it as a personal dance studio when there weren't classes. The place was very sweaty, hot, and disgusting. Bleh!  The staff there is just concerned with money! They try and push supplements on you repeatedly! I tried them for several months and honestly cannot say they made any noticeable difference.  I felt judged when going there because people would stare at my confusion towards several machines. Most machines are old and some are not working for weeks at a time.   The girls behind the counter seem clueless and are definitely only in it for the paycheck... they act like as though you are inconveniencing them if you ask questions. When I canceled, they gave me the run around for over a month. Finally, after the manager refused to return my calls, I went in and was then charged for two more months as a "60 day notice". Oh, AND, my sister-in-law went and was cheated out of over TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS! They convinced her that she had to pay up front for an extreme amount of personal training as part of a discounted price. Well, when my brother got deployed as part of the military one month later, she was never refunded her money! That's ridiculous!

I love love love the food- thank goodness I don't live close anymore- I could gain a lot of weight :) It's perfect for a casual night out on Mill Ave. It is not a formal date place but still has a good atmosphere. Personally, it is only a once in a blue moon things nowadays because it's just too expensive...

I don't usually write about a chain restaurant but the service was excellent. Drinks were always filled, dirty dishes were always cleared and staff was consistently friendly. Above and beyond friendly actually... AND it was a Saturday night!   If I ever want Chili's I'll opt to drive out of the way. The thing that would make it 5 stars? A little bit of a juicer steak!

I had never done yoga before and this was a nice experience. Holy moley did I sweat A TON!!!!   They made me feel very welcome and I didn't feel like a total idiot when I didn't know what the heck they were doing! Haha. The music was VERY soothing and with time, I think I could come to enjoy hot yoga. It was rough for a first-timer and I suggest that you take an intro class before the main hot class. That way, you have more knowledge of what the flow is like and how to be doing things correctly. In all, I am not going back until I get a better paying job-WAYYYYYY pricey for me!

If I could give 4.5, I would. They were all very personable and everyone was easy to understand. I have only been twice but I received excellent service both times. Great job with acrylics and pedicures :o) The only thing I wish could be better would be a little bit of a nicer atmosphere... sometimes it is a little loud and you can tell they have been in that building for a long time.

I just went here for the first time and I will not be going back. I'm usually not a complainer but I feel like I need to share my experience with you all.  I walk in and ask how long the wait is. 10 min. Okay, great! I understand  it is  a school and I don't mind waiting but at least TELL ME I'm going to be waiting a long time. 45 minutes go by and no one checks on me. I went to ask if I was forgotten about and they said the station was being cleaned right now. 45 minutes go by AGAIN and I finally get seated for a pedicure/manicure.   Again, I understand these are students and I can't expect perfection. No problem. The issue was the customer service, or lack thereof. I wasn't greeted with a smile or how are you... She wasn't talkative and was moving extremely slowly. Everytime she would sit down and rummage through her box, she'd realize she was missing something and would need to get up. By the time she started, the water was cold.   Then, she began reusing old instruments and instructed me that that was all she had to work with. She also didn't fail to mention how much she hates doing pedicures... several times. Really...? it shows.   The chair was uncomfortable and for 45 minutes of 'cleaning the station', it was sure dirty! It reminded me of plastic preschool chairs. But, that goes with the fact it is a school. Massage was non existent and she never communicated when she wanted my feet in/out of the water so constantly felt like I was the annoying one!   Two and a half hours later and ten dollars wasted... I left quite annoyed.

It was great. In fact, I'm near speechless... The guides were VERY respectful while still being laid back and personable. Great at pairing horses to individuals' backgrounds so if you're more experienced, you have the opportunity to be with a horse that likes a faster gait. We only had four people plus a guide so it made everything much more personalized than the traditional "nose to butt" trail. Went through forest, open land, over logs, up/down hills, through rivers... the experience was BEYOND amazing. Nothing dull about this ride especially because we were able to trot or even gallop, if we wanted to. Will DEFINITELY be back to ride with them in Paulden, AZ!!!!!
