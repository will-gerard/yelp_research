Been here a few times. Food and service has always been phenomenal. Turkey burger is the best I've ever had. Great atmosphere  you can sit outside, bar or dining room and you will have a pleasant experience.

Been wanting to eat here for a while now and finally stopped by for lunch. I was expecting more. We tried the fish, shrimp, crab, fries. Seafood had zero flavor, fries were soggy and the "pirates sauce" was watered down hot sauce. Long john silvers is wayyyyyy better. I don't think I would go back.

Great find this place is very cool. Small but love the atmosphere, staff, food selection, wine selection. If your looking for a casual time out sit at the bar and watch the chef's Chef it up!!!

Ordered takeout today pasta, couple of appetizers and a couple of sandwiches. Food as always was excellent and the service as well. Everyone always treats you like family.

Been here a few times. Breakfast items are great. Loaded potato soup and Rueben were okay. Service was excellent, everyone was very friendly.

So I have been here a few more times after my initial review and I'm sad to say I will not be returning. While the service is good, the food has been mediocre at best, food quality is not great nothing special here. Stinks it's the only breakfast place right now jn the area.

These guys are AWESOME. I first started using their services when I was managing for a national restaurant concept. They power washed our sidewalks serviced our windows. I also use them in my home, parents home and now also my parents restaurant. Prices are extremely reasonable, the whole team is very pleasant to work with. I highly recommend these guys.

Burgers, fries, service was awesome. Way better than Five guys. Burgers and fries were not greasy and all the employees including the manager made contact. Will definitely return and recommend to everyone.

This place is pretty good. Love the customer service, the young girl working tonight seemed to love her job and asked us if it was our first time, Flavors were all good, great topping and the waffle was awesome! Cool concept and great atmosphere with the upbeat music playing!

Blah! Nothing great. Was expecting a better experience, ZERO genuine guest engagement from bartender, I can get better guest experience at a national chain. Nothing here to draw you back in.

Stopped in for lunch today. Our server was great....food was mediocre at best. Definitely have had better fried chicken. The chicken fried steak was rubbery. Best part of the meal were the hot sauce, corn bread and catfish. Will return to try some breakfast items next time.

My daughter has been attending Tigers Lair for over a year now. She absolutely loves it. coach Pedro and coach Christian do a great job teaching. She won gold in her first tournament, which motivated her even more. She is passionate about winning and the coaches guide them to win!
