I haven't been to Ritos in ages but I had to try my favs..red mix enchilada style with a side of rice and beans! The beans are the best in town! So flavorful! Red chili is spicy but not overwhelming. The rice is tasty all by itself but mix it with their hot sauce and you'll have a party in your mouth! I ordered two beef tacos..two words, de lish! Hot pulled beef with lettuce and cheese and put the hot sauce on and you're in Mex food heaven! Bring your cash and your friends! This place will not disappoint you!

Go there for lunch often and I'm treated like Norm at Cheers. Love they remember my name. The servers and sushi chefs ( especially Ivan) can cut and roll some sushi! They have an underground menu you can pick from or just tell Ivan what you want in your roll ( custom)! I order the "Sasquatch" roll and I'm thoroughly satisfied. The noodles and any of the bowls there rival any sushi place around. They change out their beers weekly so you can enjoy many local brews. Try the "stoner" bowl and enjoy the spicy chicken/ ranch/ rice mix. Great for a hangover. It's local, its comfortable and it has a great happy hour on Friday.

My wife and I found plenty of parking on a Sat night (bad omen)? 1st timers. We liked the cleanliness and how the hostess greeted and seated us immediately. We ordered the artichoke spinach dip and it was served hot with salsa and spiced up chips..delicious! I ordered an Alaska amber 20oz beer and it was cold and tasty. My wife had a lemon and apple martini but she said they lacked taste. We split the fried chicken plate with mashed potatoes and corn. I was impressed that the chicken was crispy but not greasy and had a little kick in the finish... Tasty! The mashed potatoes were highlighted by the white gravy which set this apart from my mothers! Along with what I think were green chilis in the corn I was impressed how it all complimented each other! I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and food! My next time there I'm looking forward to ordering the grouper. 5 stars if it wasn't for the total price...(but worth it).

I'm on my second knee surgery and I'm very impressed by the attitudes and professionalism of the staff there! Everyone, (especially Jeff, Michelle, and Itamar) are very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the therapy that is right for you. The clinic is large, organized, and very clean. The staff is caring and always remembers my name. My PT Michelle answers all my questions about my injury and other therapy questions. She is always kind and compassionate. I had a choice where I had my rehabilitation. I'm glad I chose Foothills.

Was there last Wed 3ish liked the valet parking but when we got to the hostess she said she will text us when table is ready,"around 20 minutes" so I grabbed a beer at the bar, took a long time to get their attention. Ordered a martini for my wife and the bartender made it terribly! I played a game of ping- pong...cool! Then didn't get the text our table was ready, (my fault) 5 minutes late on getting to the hostess. She said we now have to wait 20 more minutes for a table. She argued with me for a minute or 2 until wifey got pissed then we left. I would love to have tried the food there but bad service ruined it for us! They have a great patio area though!

Went to NMB and had to look hard for the entrance but put that aside I really enjoyed their flight of beers especially the lighter ones. Tasty! I had the crab dip, pretzels, and fish 'n chips. Hint of spice in the fish batter! Yummy! Staff friendly. Clean tables and room. I felt very comfortable and was satisfied when I left!
