We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!

They recently remodeled. New chairs and nice atmosphere. $39 for mani/pedi, and they did a good job! I messed up my pedicure, and went back the next day and she fixes it for free! So nice!

We stayed here last night. I've read a few reviews about older rooms, but we were in the Mountainside Suites and our room was beautiful! Fully updated and nice. The major downfall was that at 6am on Sunday there were several PA announcements about a golf tee time. It was so loud and ridiculous at that hour. I would have given this resort a rave review, but that early am vacation wake up call ruined my experience.  I'm not sure I'd recommend this resort to a friend, based on that alone.

I'm recently trying out a gluten free diet, so I came to ZTejas knowing they have a g-free menu. I had their veggie tacos and they were amazing! Our server was also very considerate and warned me that the corn bread was not g-free. Big fan, I'll be going back soon!

We had a great experience with Great Gates! So easy to work with and gate was completed much faster than promised. They were flexible with scheduling and very accommodating. We got one other competitive bid, and Great Gates was much cheaper, which is why we went with them. Our RV gate looks beautiful! I'd definitely recommend them!

Brought some Michael Kors sandals here to fix a piece of leather that fell off. He replaced the leather with a perfectly matching piece. It was only $15 for the repair. Great service. Nice man. I will go back for any shoe repairs I need.

We bought a groupon for this club. All 4 comedians were awesome and hilarious!! The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars was because the wait staff was very slow. However I did appreciate that we did not have to stick to our 2 drink minimum requirement.

Healthiest lunch option on Mill! Great vegetarian and gluten-free selection. The staff is SO friendly. You can tell how much pride they take in their food, and they help you in making your selection. You can also taste everything before ordering it. Love this place!!

I really wanted to like this place since it's in our neighborhood, but we've now been there for both brunch & dinner and were disappointed both times. The atmosphere is so cute and the patio set up is great. However the food is terrible. We were with a party of 5 for dinner, and all of us thought our food was just blah. Then my husband & I went for brunch, and both did not like our meals then either. I hope they improve their food! I really want to like this place.

So great! Love this new cute little walk up place. We had a swirl cone, dipped cone & a root beer float. All delicious! A fun new little treat in old town!

We went here for the first time and were so impressed! A really nice atmosphere! Clean, nice comedy club. We saw Dustin Ybarra, he was hilarious! Our MC was Jack and he was actually probably our fav part of the show! We laughed the whole time. The drinks were a bit pricey, we had two dirty martinis and they were $17 each! But I think beers & wines may have been more fairly priced. So nice to have a real comedy club up here in our neighborhood! Definitely recommend it!!
