Great food and service . Ordered a large cold sub and was ready before I sat down. Now that's fast!

Great food when it's served to you . We ordered 2 salads , a calzone and a slice of pizza . We get the slice and calzone and was asked if I received all of my food . I grabbed the food and one of the workers said oh sorry someone else will make it . We're done with the shared slice and calzone and I go up and ask about the salads that are still not served . Mind you the workers are now talking among themselves since no other customers are in line for  food . Finally the salads come over in a all bowls that take less time to make then the slice and calzone together . I wanted to bring to the lack of attention that not only happens to your place and also other places that I don't spend money at anymore for the above reasons

Ate outside to check out central Phx . The red pepper and feta cheese appetizer is delish. Happy hour prices make the dinner price lower :) Ordered the meatball sub, yum. The service is great and quick also.

$15 fee to pay to cancel . I've never heard of such a ridiculous part of a gym membership . Not like I'm dying me and it costs more to leave compared to enter the world .   By the way, when I joined , I never received a hard copy of EOS gym membership , nor was it emailed to me .
