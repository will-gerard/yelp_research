I absolutely love this place!  I actually am not a huge sushi fan, but my wife is.  She loves the sushi and I can actually eat and enjoy anything on the menu.  I think the difference between this place and other sushi bars is the freshness of the product and I like the happy hour prices. I've been there numerous times and have never had a bad experience.  I recommend this place!  PS A little tip, ask for the chopped Wasabi, not the colored stuff they give you.  SOOOO good.

If I could give this store and the company a lower rating I would.  I went in to the store to simply cancel a plan because I'm moving abroad.  I knew that I was going to have to pay a cancellation fee, which made how they treated me worse.  Basically, they couldn't cancel my service in the store and I was forced to call their customer support IN THE STORE, which I was hung up on twice!  It took me over and hour and a half to simple cancel one phone line.  What made things worse is they wouldn't let me cancel the contract for an entire month so I had to pay for the cancellation fee + another month of phone service that I couldn't use because the phone was not compatible in Europe.  The manager was obviously trying to hide from me because he made one of his least experienced representatives work with me and he made sure to look busy on the opposite side of the store.   BTW, I wanted to sell the phone back to the store, which I was quoted $100 a few weeks prior from their customer service.  When I arrived to the store, they told me the phone was now worth $33.  How does a phone in perfect shape lose $77 of value within weeks?    What angers me the most about Verizon is how I've been a customer with them since 2002.  When I move back to the states, I will NOT sign back up with Verizon.  Verizon is a horrible company.
