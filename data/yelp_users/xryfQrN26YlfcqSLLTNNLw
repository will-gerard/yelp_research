One of my all time favorite places to go. Especially, if I'm feeling pizza, pasta, or want a massive salad. The rumors are true, their portions are huge. Unless you're starving...you might want to opt into the smaller sizes of things; )  I usually go for dinner, but went out to lunch with a friend on this day. For pasta, the Big Rig w/ chicken is the way to go. I got their lunch size, and it was quite a perfect portion. I was perfectly full, and was actually able to still go back and put gym equipment together.   Pizza : they are literally all great! I like the number uno though.  Pasta: Big Rig w/chicken. They also have sausage and meatballs as options. Big Rig has a chipolte base, so it's a little on the spicy size.  Salad : Pablo Picasso. The dressing is a little spicy as well for this one!  Also, their cheesy bread is great! But also filling! (Appetizer)

Love pita jungle!  This location has the fastest service of the all the locations that I've ever been to. Their roasted bell pepper hummus is the best. Get that with chicken, and you're set. Their chipotle pizza is great as well. Almost equally as good!   Perfect service, great staff. Will be back here!

First timer here:  Was my first go, as I was excited for the stuffed french toast, assuming it was all day breakfast. They do have all day breakfast, but it was only about 5 items I think :(  Anyhow, I'm not picky. Ordered the Mushroom Brie burger  (medium well). It was ok. But it wasn't medium well (see picture). And half of it tasted burnt on the edges. The $5 red house wine was good though. My gf thought the Cobb salad was ok. Decent. The soup she got with it wasn't very hot at all. A tad bit over room temp...still tasted good though.  Anyhow, I've still heard things about this place. Maybe it's the breakfast that sets it apart. I'll probably try breakfast from here one day, and edit this review possibly.   Customer service was great though, if that means anything to you! :)  2 stars = me not really excited to go back.

Customer service is ok. It seems just a TAD too much for the few servers that exist. Meaning, that people somehow skipped ahead of us on the wait list,  the server forgot a small side item, and there is about a 15 min wait. - small petty things that might piss off a snobby person. But not me! Other than that, I love this place. Its a close, great breakfast place that has a great selection of quality food!   Four peaks french toast is awesome, as well as the powerhouse, breakfast tacos, and all the other southwestern items!

I go here every now and then, usually on Tuesdays (taco). Mercedes is usually there, and she is SUPER nice. She remembers you're name, and is very awesome when it comes to customer service. CS is something that people aren't getting these days, and when they do get it...its not consistent like Mercedes'.

I've always liked the crust overall. But I ordered the Buffalo pizza (comes with buffalo sauce). I've tried this kind of pizza at 2 other places and it was about 7x better. The buffalo sauce tasted more like a tangy syrup or something similar of. I hate to say it, but I wont be back to Pizza Hut for quite a while. Threw my appetite off!    Best case: Don't try their buffalo pizza.

3/15/16 - Love the food and dessert here. The ambience is nice and low light makes for a good first date. The staff is great, especially the servers/cooks. The hostess (girls up front) aren't the friendliest. Regardless, I'll still come back to this place because of their cheesecake lol. They have a huge menu to choose from, whether it's for you're entree or desert.   It can get pretty busy at dinner time, especially on a weekend! Plan accordingly.  Update: 4/9/16 - it took about 10 minutes to get us seated. I was actually impressed, with it being a Saturday night. We ordered cheesecake only, and killed it in about 15 minutes. It's now been about 45 minutes after we've finished our food and our server still hasn't brought our check. He seems new and stressed out. I don't blame him, I blame this particular restaurant for putting him on the stop without being fully prepared. Yes this kind of a rant. Brought it down to 2 stars :(

I have been renting from this location for about an entire year now. I've probably rented 15 times or so. I shoot landscapes, so I'm usually all over the south west! This place is great. It's an Avis and a budget location built in 1. Making it super convenient to choose a lower cost, especially if you're a cheapo like myself.   If all the times I've rented here, I've never had one single bad experience. They are usually quick and efficient. Even the guys that work in the back (that make sure you're car is clean and ready to go) are super nice! Barb has always been great! There are times where you will have to wait, but let's face it...people show up when they want to show up!  They always make you feel appreciated, and I honestly think that's how real customer service should be. I'm moving soon further in South Chandler, so I pray that the next Avis will be half as good as this location.

An all time favorite restaurant of mine.  Between the food, staff, vibes, and location...this place is as good as it gets. The price is probably what will get most people, because its so easily dangerous to try more and more food. Everything they have has literally been great. The chef's pizza is always a favorite of mine. And the chef is a super nice humble dude, might I add?  If you like beer, try their Golden Monkey. Not many people have it on draft, and I find it a luxury that I get to drink that here! Deserts are obviously to die for. The bread pudding (flaver changes weekly I think?) is a fav. I will always come back again and again to this place. I and many friends have yet to try ANYTHING that is not completely satisfying.

Just found a new position off of Germann and Dobson, so I'm always on the lookout for a good lunch deal. This place probably beats any other place within miles (until another Barros pops up). Best lunch deal around hands down. 2 slices and a drink is literally under $5.  When you're a cheap guy like me, this is the way to go. The price doesn't say much about the quality though. The pizza always tastes great. I order delivery sometimes, and always request Mike. He is hilarious. The staff in general are always friendly. I am happily moving to this area soon, and will be visiting this location many more times.   I also want to take a moment to brag that I am the Duke for this Barros on Yelp:)

I tried this place for the first time the other night at the Warner location. I believe this is a pick-up only location. Faith at the front desk is awesome. They are known for their deep dish I think...but I opted in for the rare thin crust.  It was good. I liked it alot, and I'd honestly compare the thin crust to oreganos thin crust (because of their size, cut, and pricing). I hope thats not a huge step down for some, because both are awesome. It was about a 25 minute wait on a friday night. I think I would have given this place a 5 star, if it had just a TAD bit little less grease. That was the only step back for me, honestly. But again, its alot of cheese, and toppings on a thin crust. So that is typical I think! I do find myself trying this again in the future.

Honestly such a great bargain. For about $60 a person, they serve you a full dinner with desert, and take you about 7 miles into the Canyon. It was honestly a cool experience for myself, regardless if it was for me or my girlfriend. Having Dr. Sky on boat was just a plus. We had a great common interest for astrology and astrophotography. My lady had a blast. The summer months would probably be a little too hot to sit on the outside of the boat. I went last week (June 25) and it was a little warm, but felt nice once the sen went down. Staff was amazing, everything about it was really awesome. It would be hard to have a bad experience here. Thanks guys, I'll definitely be back!   Ps, bring cash if you want to purchase extra goodies, or alcohol etc.

Just blown away with this location! I knew that Walmart itself, already has a pretty bad rep, but this is just crazy. No one in the store is very helpful. They are less than friendly. The staff alone is just never in a decent mood.   One encounter: I was trying to buy a fishing license one day, and the lady was trying to tell me that they don't sell them when the department is closed. I thought, ok understandable. I asked what time it closed and she said 8pm I think. Well it was about 7:42. 18 minutes till. I could tell that she was the one that would have to open up the department, because she is the one who closed it early. She then argued with me, and then complained that Walmart didn't get her enough of a break, only 15 minutes! I was astounded.   Second encounter: I was in the area and decided to go finish some grocery shopping. (Yes I know, I can't believe I went back to this place). My shopping cart was full, and I'm aware that if the shopping cart is too far out, then a magnetic signal with stop the cart from being pushed and stolen. So the cart was completely inoperable about 75 yards out...and I had a shopping cart full of stuff. I was stuck and had to pull my car around to the cart itself, stressing more that someone would steal my groceries...judging by the average customer that shops here.  This sounds like just a horrible rant, but literally does not do any of the stories justice in person.

I've tried about 5 Thai places so far. I've come to a conclusion that Yellow Curry is my thing! Thats of course what I ordered. My gf got the Pho Tai. We also got the garlic Clams I think. The curry was a solid 2/5, and the Pho Tai, neither of us liked. The clams tasted great, but only about 1 of 3 clams, had something in them. They were all SHELLS! That is what really got to me, especially with the price tag for those guys. I feel as if i spent an equivalent amount of money on grade A Thai place, but had no satisfaction. I don't think I'll be coming back to this place.

Lived by this place for 2 years, had no clue what I was missing. I tried the bloom sandwich, and it was amazing. I had macaroni salad and potato salad (because the employee insisted that I try both), and he gave the extra side at no charge.   Also, the service was excellent. Incredibly nice people there! Well deff go back!

So I'm new to this restaurant, as I work nearby now. I gave this a shot the other day with a group of co-workers and afterwards...I made the decision to want to come here again. To start off, the customer service was fantastic! Everyone said hello when we walked in, and had a pleasant smile that you couldn't see through! The menu was pretty decent in size, so theres plenty of things to choose from. I think I ordered a wrap, and it was delicious. Greek fries to go with was the best part! They were insane! For what you get, its totally worth it. This place doesn't break the wallet...and is in a great quiet area. (It wasn't packed during lunch hours). I'll be back here!

The girls at this location are flawless! I come to this location because it just happens to be the closest, but I have been to probably 9 different sportclips. This one stands out the most, mostly for customer service.   I one random day I decided to try this location after the new move, and I was hooked since. The manager is great, as well as everyone employed there. I am moving again soon, but am debating driving the extra mile to keep this place my main!  These girls deal with people all the time that come in 5 minutes to close (I'm not one of them!), and they keep their composure with a smile on their face. That's just one example that separates them from other locations.   Chelsea that just moved from this location will be missed, as she was the best head massager ever.  Dana is definitely at the top of the list when it comes to a quality haircut. She listens, and cuts accurately! She can also put up with a rediculous non stop conversation from me. Ask for her!

I chose to come here, after not really deciding on where to go on a late Friday night. Its one of those places like Filibertos, or Amado's thats usually open late at night, and you can expect it to not disappoint! Well sure enough, it was one of those places. I was pleased with the service provided. They didn't have a HUGE bar selection...but their queso dip was awesome! The DJ that night (Friday) didn't have the best choices either (sorry dude). It wasn't packed either, but that's a plus in my book. Will probably go back here a few times.

This is the closest car wash to me. I've been here twice so far. If you have an odd tail end like me with somewhat of a hatchback spoiler, it leaves tons of soapy water underneath. It's a big stream of water every time. I feel like that could be the cars build though.  However, the car wash stopped in the middle of washing my car. My car stopped moving, and the wash pads just sat all over my car. Kinda weird. They manually over-rided it I think to get it started up again. Towards the end of the same wash...it felt like my car came off the track. It may or may not have, but it surely felt like it. There was a loud bang from my car vs the car wash. Not sure I'll go back, but what can you expect for a $3 car wash. It's super cheap, so you get what you pay for. My first experience was better.  The staff and vacuums seem cool though!

This is an awesome safe place to stop and get coffee! They also have a bunch of different teas. I haven't been here in quite a while until recently. If I lived closer I'd definitely come every other day!  It's a small quiet place to meet a friend or plan a trip. I see people with laptops all the time here, so you can get work done if it's necessary here. But don't let that make you think this place isn't a spot to just chill at. I've never been on the weekends, but I think they have a bunch of live music at that time. It looks like a small place on the outside, but it's super spacious inside, with alot if comfortable seating. They also have outdoor seating.  The staff is super cool as well. The manager is awesome. They also have great Wall art th at is possibly for sale. (I'd love to hang my work here, and I'm actually picky).  Go try this place!

I waited forever to try this place! Me and a gf went one evening. It was quite busy. I got some kind of Croissant sandwich. There menu wasn't huge. It matched the limited seating in the small restaurant. Usually that means, prepare for something special! I expected more I guess. The food was ok to me. They did have some craft beer available. The staff wasn't very welcoming though. One girl literally just stared at us as we entered the restaurant and waited for us to order. Not the greatest position to be in when it's busy and you have a line behind you (especially when it's you're first time here). One guy seemed very optimistic working though. Anyhow, I wasn't overall amazed. If I find myself in the area...I will try this place again and update this review. Perhaps it's the breakfast, alcohol, or mimosas that they are known for.

The dude was nice there. He gave us a stamp card and had decent manners, unlike the younger lady which was quite rude, and wanted us to know she hated her job apparently.  We sampled a few flavors and thought the pineapple tasted funny. Something like rotten milk  (no I'm not exaggerating). So we didn't go with that one. And we didn't sample everything obviously.   We went with the new york cheesecake flavor and hoped it was good. It however tasted the same. Like a bad rotten milk flavor. Not great. We got half mint and half NY cheesecake and they both tasted like this. So thats 3x that this had a weird taste to it. Not good.  Prior to this, we asked the lady what the most popular flavor was, and literally rolled her eyes and told us cake batter which such a blunt tone.   Anyhow, Iiterally just gave an extra star because the dude was nice in there.   Customer service from the lady was bad. As well as the quality of food. Dissapointed as it was our first time

This location is great! - yes I consider myself to be am oreganos pro. I've been to many! I live close to this location now, so this is the new regular.  The staff here at this location is great. The younger lady at the pick up station especially! Of all the times I've been here, there was 1 hiccup. A couple of waiters were confused about which tables they were responsible for, and forgot about us for a little bit. They resolved this with a free cookie - which can literally make up for anything!   Overall. Everything here is great. As long as the staff and food stay awesome...I'll forever be a customer to this location.   Pasta 10/10 Pizza 8/10 Salad 9/10  And so much more to choose from.

This is a great place that's honestly, REALLY tucked away in Chandler. Even though it's off of Chandler Blvd...it's the opposite direction of a crowd. It's a few miles from the Chandler Fashion Square Mall, which why you won't find a SUPER packed restaurant. That's a rare gem if you ask me, especially on a weekend night.    There was not a wait, which was super suprising! I'm used to an Oreganos-like wait in order to get decent pizza or pasta. Everything seems to be advertised as homemade. It honestly tasted like it too. I got the sixth topping (forgot what it's called, something six) pizza. It was delicious.  It was paritucliary sweet. Not sure if all of pizza sauce is that sweet. Wasn't bad st all though. My gf got the turkey and pesto sandwich (I think), and that also was great. The bread was the  best part, and it didn't fill you up with calories either.   It was great pricing. The literal only the thing that could have been better...was the waiter. He was a bit awkward - not to throw anyone under the bus! I'll still be back, and could rate this place 5 stars afterwards...

After hearing about this place for months, I decided to give it a go. Just after 2 times, I can say that this spot will become a regular for me. Quality and anything that wont break your wallet is what I like to eat! The quesodillas are a little better than the burritos. They are flawless! And the margaritas are good as well! Decent beer options as well! Will be back numerous times!

THE BAD:  Me and a friend decided to give this a try after a another referred us. It was a Sunday morning, close to noon....and let me tell you...it was PACKED. After a long hike, standing for about 65 minutes is not what you want to do. I don't know if this place takes reservations, but it took a while. We were patient though. For all you impatient people, you should think about that.   THE GOOD:  The food, definitely made up for it though. The pancakes are unreal, along with the maple syrup! Coffee was OK. I was very content afterwards due to the quality/preparation of the food and customer service. If I'm ever around the Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area...I will find myself here most likely, and you should too!

Ordered a burrito bowl, and a burrito. Both were not satisfying to me and my partner. We both like Chipotle, but not this time. Both meals had TONS of rice, and I mean a ridiculous (not appetizing) amount of rice. Both were missing lettuce and were tastless. Idk what went wrong to make it lack taste. Maybe it was all the rice. Between the these 2 things, it was enough to say that I won't be going back to this location. I'll be posting pictures to show everyone what I'm talking about, that way you dont think this is all just an unnecessary rant.

I have been living only 6 minutes away from this place. I love pita jungle, it's always been that way. This location is right off the 10, so it's super convenient. Their hummus is the best around. Everything about the entire menu is great. Awesome variety to order from. Staff always super friendly! I will forever come here until I'm tired of it.

After months of waiting to try this famous pb and j burger....I was in the area and gave it a go.  I was working, so I ordered pickup. I got sweet potato fries instead of regular...and they were the ish! Customer service was excellent as well. High energetic place which it seemed, the little time I was inside of course.   I told them that it was my first time, so they put all of their sauces in my bag to try as well. They were all great. Scottsdale was a little out the way for me, but I will definitely be making my way up their again for this burger. They won me over, easily.

I don't even know where to begin! This place is just fantastic all around! It's only about 0.8 miles from my apartment, and I had no clue what I was missing the whole time! To start off with, Jeanie (I think that's her name) was super awesome! I didn't ask, but I think she is the manager. She's super welcoming with a sense of humor, lol. She told us that everything was homemade there. And yes, it did taste like she was telling the truth!  The tangerine lemonade is to die for, seriously. I had the meatloaf sandwich and my gf had a different sandwich and soup. They also seem to be known for their Quiche! It has got to be the best thing they have to offer, beside their customer service! I will find myself here at least a few more times before I move!   If you're in the area, and you're looking to try a new place that you won't be disappointed with...please take the time to give this little place a shot. Its small so chances are...you wont have to worry about a crowd. It has an awesome quiet atmosphere with some art hanging up (I would love to have my photos hung up in there)! This place honestly blows most out the water.   Try the Quiche (green chile) and Tangerine Lemonade on you're first visit!

Ordered a hot wing pizza, and cheesy bread sticks (yes I feel fat). The hot wing usually comes with ranch, but it doesn't anymore I suppose. I had to pay extra for ranch.   Yes this sounds like a rant, but hear me out.   It was pickup. Went and picked it up. Should've checked inside the box, but no ranch as I find out. And we're already home. The games starting. Eh. The thing that bothered me, is that they weren't even busy! Restaurant was about 20% full. They had no realistic excuse.  The other on going issue, is that the pizza is never cut! The managers usually cut the pizzas, and for some odd reason, it's me always tearing apart pizzas lol. The slices are no where near even. One could be 2.5 slices wide, and the other could be a quarter size slice.   Pictures don't do it's justice.   Called and spoke to a girl, which led to speaking to another girl...explaining the issue again, and the 2nd one chuckled before she yet again put us on hold to speak with a manager.   After meeting and knowing about 5 members of the Barros family...I'd expect them to eventually raise their standards of their staffing.

Noticed this place, by just walking by one day. Being that I have never actually officially measured myself for a dress shirt...I walked in thinking that I could just get measured and be on my way. Nick was the first to greet me, and he did definitely exceeded expectations. Turns out, I'm an odd size...but this store had what I needed. I'm a 16 in the neck, and a 36/37 in the sleeves. 9/10 times, the average place will NOT have this size...and this place did. Not only did they carry many different sizes that are rare, they had plenty to choose from...and it honestly didn't break the wallet. If you buy 2 shirts, you get them for $20 each. I'd definitely go back, and pay that price to find a shirt that fits me perfect. They have plenty of deals on shirts, ties, bow ties, full suits, pants, and much more. I'll probably find myself back here once I need some more things!

Great place to check off you're list in the Gilbert area. It can get quite busy with a 30-45min wait at times. So plan accordingly. I think the food is a TAD bit over priced as far as the quantity you get. Service and ambience is what this place is known for I think. I'm one of those super tall guys that can eat a lot. They don't have a crazy entre that fills me up completely. I go for what they have to offer though: The Beast Burrito. The 1st batch of Chips and Salsa are complimentary (they used to be all free though :/)

I have been finding myself here almost every Taco-Tuesday. I don't know where to start. It's in an odd location off the 87 I think. Because of that reason, I think most people don't know about this gem.  They have $1.50 tacos on Tuesday, and I can't seem to get enough. I'll usually purposely order a lot, that way I don't have to order more in 1 sitting. It never works though. I swear there is something in these tacos that make you get more and more!   Their tacos are street style, so they are small, but they have  massive flavor. Marinated chicken is the best I think. The hardshell tacos are great as well. I haven't tried the burgers, but I hear great things about them.   The staff is great as well, and I think the older lady is Julia:)    if you love tacos or better yet Mexican food...you must try this place asap! It blows most places out the water.

This was my first ever trip here today as I couldn't find a cheaper/closer wash. (Yes I'm cheap). After waiting at the gate to pay/enter for a little while, I finally got out of my car to approach the closest man that had his back turned. I was thinking that he didn't know I was there. As soon as I got out, he turned around and pointed his finger and said, "I'll be right with you". It wasn't the most pleasant tone that I've been around to be honest. After speaking with him for 2 minutes...turns out he wasn't very nice at all, and had no manners. He then noticed that I was in a work vehicle and started talking about fleet memberships and other profitable ideas for the entire company that I work for. Turns out, this person was the General Manager, Barnet Jacobs. He obviously wasn't too thrilled about something, and allowed it to get the best of him. He didn't treat me like a customer, nor a paying customer. He skipped right to the "bringing more money to his business" part. I don't think a person like that deserves my money or future business.   It was solely customer service that rendered a this review. I only rated this place 2 stars, because for $5... the wash was a little better than the average car-wash, and it has free vacuums.

I'm new to Thai food, so I don't have much experience with comparing to others Thai restaurants or the origin itself. The yellow curry has been my go to for many times now, and I can say that this place has their yellow curry on point! It was about $15 for yellow curry with added chicken. You honestly don't even need the chicken because it's loaded with flavor though. Let me stop though, because I'm starting to think that this review is exclusively on yellow curry.   The customer service was great. They were super nice and friendly. Didn't take long to get our food. Oh and the dumplings are amazing (appetizer)! It was a Sunday late evening around 5, and we were the only people their! One person actually came in, but that was it. Overall, an awesome, cozy, and chill place that I will be most likely visiting back and forth now!

Just tried thus place for the first time. It's tucked back into a plaza area but its worth looking for!  I live close, so I guess I have been missing out on this place ordered take out within the yelp app, which is super convenient and rare! That's honestly what got me started here.  Ordered 3 gyro wraps. 2 spicy and 1 Philly style. They were all great! The spicy gyros are seriously spicy though! Be prepped if you order those. Philly style was perfect to me. I'll definitely be back a couple more times before I relocate!  Ps, if you get takeout, be sure that they doubke bag (the brown bags)...because mine broke and everything came out. Lucky they didn't roll down the staircase!   An awesome taste for something that won't break you're wallet!

Great little hidden place. I usually go to the location off of Guadalupe, but this location is the new close one for me with the recent move.  I went around 1pm on a Monday and it was dead! Not sure, why...because the food was great! There was only one other table inside being served. Appetizers and entrees are great! Price is even better, which is a biggie for a cheap guy like myself.   Literally the best place to get you're sushi fix.  Fav Rolls: Caterpillar, crunch, and California tempura.  The monkeys rolls make a great appetizer! I'll be back to this spot for sure!

I've given this Starbucks multiple chances to redeem themselves after previous mistakes and bad customer service.  This was my most definitely my last trip here. The older lady is so rude there. I'm the nicest guy ever, and can easily make a conversation with anyone, just to put myself into a perspective for some. She gets frustrated when I have a specific order, or ask for extra this or that. She can't handle pressure, especially when there's a long line. You can easily see the frustration on her face.   She tells me to "hold on" when I give her the instructions of how I want my order made, so she can write one thing at a time on the cup. Other times, if I don't tell her in time that I want it "double blended, extra this or extra that"...she gets frustrated that i didn't tell her in time! So idk which way to go! I have to actually prep myself to order in a special way because I know that she'll back taking my order? It's ridiculous.   She honestly ruined it for me. I won't go to this Starbucks anymore. I feel that if I'm going to pay $5 for coffee, then I should be able to have it how I want it...and not have to stress because she'll shake her head and sign because I ask for something a certain way....  Yes this review seems harsh to the average viewer, but it's brutally honest. I know that I'm not the only one, because there was about 4 other people that were also having to deal with her bad attitude. You could easily see it in their faces too, that they were astonished. This review seems to be more about her and not about Starbucks. Regardless, she is representing Starbucks and should be held responsible for a customers experiences.

I've given this Sonic 3-4 tries. I like this location because it's super conveniently close and there's not another south of here for miles.   Every time if go to this location, there seems to consistently be an issue with my order. The location is great. The staff seems wonderful, but all that is pointless when you're order is incorrect. Especially when it's the food, that leaves you're last impression on the business. Not a fan!

Just moved out here. This place is literally within walking distance of me. I am most excited about that part! I lease apartments in the area and hear nothing but good things about this place. I think they changed their name once before.  Anyhow, I gave them a shot and then I was hooked. I've tried this place twice already. They have a great menu! So many burgers to choose from, and an insane amount of different beer! Service can get a little crazy. So definitely "get in line" with their sweet phone app to save you some time. They have a crazy amount of the, so it's great for playoffs! They also advertise a mobile app to where you can hear the tv of you're choice from you're phone, which is a great idea. I couldn't get it to work, but hopefully that pulls through.   Service can get a little slow, but all the girls and staff seem great. The price isn't that crazy for the items I their menu too. So...if price, food quality, and service are great....that's enough to keep a customer coming.   If you like cold beer, and cheeseburgers (hence the name), you should definitely this place a shot.

Little hidden place in a plaza had a great reviews. I decided to give it a try, and they owned up! It wasn't a huge menu, but they had just what they advertise, burritos! They were a bit small (compared to competitors), but they were also a little more affordable too. It was definitely quality of quantity here. Tasted great!
