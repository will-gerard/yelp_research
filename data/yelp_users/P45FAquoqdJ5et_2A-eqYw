Small pub, but great staff, food and drinks! I've been going to BOP for about a year, and I've never had a poor experience. It also feels like a genuine English pub!

I've been coming to Fiesta Burrito for months now, and the food is always good. From the breakfast burritos, to the various entrees, the food always hits the spot. It's not exceptional, but there is never a wait, and I know I can always count on getting my Mexican food fix here, and that makes me happy.

I've been eating at this place for months, and they never disappoint. They ALWAYS deliver quickly. The main dishes (fried rice, General Tso's entrees, etc) are always fantastic. They're hot and fresh. However, the side dishes (the egg rolls, dumplings, soup) are always sub-par. The egg rolls are dry, the dumplings are cold, the soups are cold, and it's just not...great. The solution? I order only the main dishes. If you haven't tried China Wok, do it. Just stick with the entrees.

My friend took me here for the first time today, and I have to say, I'm really impressed. I've lived in various Asian countries, and truly know what is and isn't authentic cuisine, and House Modern Sushi is certified exquisite! From top to bottom, this place feels like a sushi house you'd find tucked away in a small side street of Tokyo. I highly recommend HMSR if you're picky about Asian food as I am. You will not be disappointed.

Of all the restaurants I frequent for my sushi fix, I'd have to say Sushi Station is one of my favorites. I love the ambiance, and the chatter of happy people everywhere. If you haven't eaten here before, note that they charge you via a plate color system (white plates costing $1.25, blue $2.75, purple 3.25, yellow 4.25, and black 5.25), so it is easy to accumulate a larger bill than you might think. On average, I spend about $25 each time I go, though I have a large appetite. That aside, the sushi is always fresh, and the variety is fantastic! Definitely consider giving them a shot, even if you have to drive a bit to get there (I personally live 30 minutes away, but it's worth it!)

My friend and I stopped by on our way to have sushi next door (@House Modern Sushi) and we tried their "batch #1" (a blonde Belgian) and a vodka cranberry. Both were spectacular. The staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is laid back, Jason was the bomb, and the owner Matt was very nice! I look forward to trying their food in the very near future.

A friend and I ordered a pizza sub, "loaded" fries, and a salad. The order took 1 hour and 20 minutes to arrive, even though we are a couple miles away. The delivery driver did text me and ask where I lived, though all he said was "Hey where are u." All the food was cold, and the sub had a rubbery type texture to it, indicating someone microwaved it. The "loaded" fries barely had any toppings, and again, were cold. I will try their pizza before I make a decide whether or not to eat here again.

Ok. I have to admit it. Genos really won me back. I was contacted by Toby, the owner, personally, and she apologized profusely for the sub-par service I experienced the last time I ordered. She comp'ed the entire meal, and this time, the food arrived quickly, was hot a fresh, and DELICIOUS! Seriously, I'm not a big burger guy,but this pepper burger I ordered is truly 10/10. If you've had a poor experience in the past with Genos, give them another shot. They are definitely worth it.
