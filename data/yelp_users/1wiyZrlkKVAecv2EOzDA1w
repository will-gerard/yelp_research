Excellent little gem of a neighborhood restaurant! Their sandwich bread is amazing and their sandwiches are huge! The main bartender/waiter who was there on Monday was the friendliest guy and made us feel welcome the minute we walked in the door. This place is tiny, but what it lacks in space it makes up for with the food! I highly recommend this grill to anyone in the Scottsdale area!

Awful drinks. The beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible. Not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game.

This restaurant is excellent! The food was incredible, the service was spectacular and the ambiance was amazing. Their menu is full of remarkably creative items. This is a seafood restaurant, but they twist the items so that they are different than other restaurants in this same category. With menu items like: Chilled Avocado and Crab Cocktail with Spicy Remoulade, Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp with Shiitakes and Sugar Snap Peas, Sliced Wagyu Beef "Hot Rock" Ishiyaki with Soy Broth, Lightly Smoked Filet of Atlantic Salmon with Bok Choi and Chinese Black Bean Vinaigrette, Seared Pacific Ahi Steak with Sautéed Shiitake Mushrooms and Wasabi Potato Puree, Crispy Cashew Calamari with Fine Cut Vegetables and Ginger and Soy, Truffled Macaroni & Cheese and Sautéed Spinach with Garlic and Shallots, who could ask for more!    From our experience: The bread was fresh and service was quick, friendly and efficient. The dumplings were superb and the sauce they were in was perfectly seasoned. The lobster bisque, scallops, ahi steak and swordfish were cooked to perfection. The only item we weren't impressed with were the french fries that came with the swordfish. Although not bad in taste, they didn't mesh with the swordfish. Other than that, the dinner was superb and I would recommend this restaurant for dates, groups and business evenings.

Okay room, but the location isn't safe. It's cheaper than some hotels around the area, but honestly, not worth the lower cost if you care about safety. Don't walk around the area alone or with children at night. I used to live in Tempe/Scottsdale and I wouldn't stay in this area again, even though it was closer to the location I needed to go to the next morning.  Many other options available for similar costs.

Great hotel with excellent staff. Clean, easy to locate, great location, comfortable bed, nice shower and adequate pool. Negative: there are no drawers in the room. Literally, no drawers. There are some shelves in the bathroom, but there is not a single drawer in the whole room.  We had a 3 month old infant when we stayed here for 4 days and the drawers would have helped. However, not a huge issue. I read some reviews that were annoyed with the air conditioner. I am a REALLY light sleeper and I had no issues with the air conditioner.  Also, rooms on the west side are nicer because you get a sunset view of Tempe Town Lake.

This restaurant is one of the many Fox Restaurant Concepts in the Valley of the Sun. The Fox Restaurant Concept has mastered creating amazing ambiance in great locations. What they need to focus on now is creating amazing food to equal the ambiance.  There were 5 of us in our party on a Friday night. When we arrived around 7:30pm the restaurant was pretty empty. We sat at the bar and were intrigued at the gorgeous décor. From the all white foundation of the rooms to the light blue accents everywhere, the entire restaurant is truly beautifully appointed. In fact, it's so nice, you may almost be willing to accept some mediocrity in the food area...and then again, maybe not.  We ended up sitting out on the patio area at a really nice table. Weather was beautiful, company was great and the drinks were made to perfection. Then, first thing I notice after we get comfortable is a huge rip in the chair cushion at the table across from us. Not a big deal, but definitely strange for a restaurant that's trying to rank up there with Morton's and Ruth's Chris Steakhouses. Right? Next, out of the 5 of us at the table - 4 of us ordered steak. Out of the 4 of us that ordered steak - 3 of us had to return our steaks because they weren't cooked. Now, anyone who has worked in a restaurant knows the deal with steak temperatures, so I can understand a little difference here, but when the server doesn't mention that they cook their steaks 2 levels different than what you are actually ordering, kind of makes you wonder about the kitchen ability. (For instance: one steak was supposed to have been medium well and came out bloody.) Now, in defense of the kitchen, the fish and the sides we ordered were great! Of course the manager was nice enough to remove one of the steaks and give us 2 free deserts (of which no one ate because they were really bad). All in all, the dinner was not worth the price.  My opinion of this restaurant is much like my opinion of the other Fox Restaurant Concepts. Ambiance = Amazing. Food = More to be desired. I agree with a friend who said, "Fox should spend as much on their chefs as they do on their interior designers and they'd be a huge hit in every state!"

The service here is impeccable. We had a party of 4 adults and 5 kids/babies. They were above and beyond courteous. Restaurant was clean, food was good, iced mocha was DELICIOUS. Highly recommend this restaurant.
