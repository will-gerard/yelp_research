The vibe in here is great, fantastic to stop in for some wine and relax. Staff was very friendly. However, last night the odor was so bad (we guess from a sewer/grease trap) that we paid and left our $13 glass of wine unfinished. Hope it's fixed soon.

The breakfast is the best! We are always amazed how fast our order arrives, the kitchen is super fast. From pancakes to the breakfast sandwich it is delicious. Definitely great comfort food, nothing fancy and the prices are very fair.  Downside, no credit cards and no wifi.

We have found a great place!! It is located in an unassuming, older strip mall but inside it is very nice.  The service and food were all fantastic! An added bonus we brought our own favorite wine (seasmoke Pinot). We had the 4 course tasting and it was the perfect amount of food. While everything was great, my partner loved the Wagyu Bone Marrow and I can't decide if the risotto or skirt steak were the best. Every course was delicious and we were doing a happy dance in our chair over the desserts! We can't wait to return and if you run out of wine, just go back how you entered at the wine bar, awesome selection.

Fantastic pulled pork and the macaroni and cheese was delicious. We waited about 45 minutes at 6:30 on a beautiful Saturday night! Love the way the smokers fill the air....

I'm only Writing a review for the bakery. We just had a fantastic chocolate cake filled with chocolate mousse. It was for a 10 year-olds birthday party. This cake was incredibly moist, it looked great with lots of icing for the balloons and sweet enough to satisfy any picky 10 y/o lover's sweet tooth. The price with tax was ONLY $18.31, a great value!

I just love the St. Francis! For starters, I'm a big fan that it is family-owned and they do garden fresh right. The cocktails are high-quality, and I especially like the Lemonade - made with vodka, pomegranate syrup, and fresh-squeezed lemonade, it's very refreshing. The wood-fired flat breads have a perfect blistered crusts and seasonal vegetables. The flat breads are high quality and my favorite item on the menu (order the market vegetable). The meatballs (Moroccan Spiced Meatballs) are delicious and so unique.  Go for happy hour and try everything, the prices are great for HH, $5  libations. The reason they don't get 5 stars is the 2nd floor is very warm.

We wanted lobster and remembered this restaurant from Southern California so thought to give it a try. We were seated promptly and served warm sour dough bread very quickly. The oysters were fresh but very small and at $13 for a half dozen not a great value. But the main event, we loved the steamed lobster. It was fun and our professional friendly server let our 9 y/o pick our fresh lobster. The bar was nice and it seemed like a fun place to gather after work.

The food is decent, but the service is horrible. No reservations on the weekend. The hostess had a smirk, heavy sigh and eye roll to match a surly teenager! The food runners had no idea who ordered what, and we had already waited a long time for our order, then had to help; further adding to the poor service experience! Coffee was good! Overall experience marred by poor service!

There is always a line out the door, so couldn't wait to finally try this place. Our server was top notch, he was quick with the beverages and packed up the leftovers at the table. The simple antipasto salad and bread are delicious, I loved the soft bread and dipping oil and let's just say I had my share of carbs this meal. The obviously homemade lasagna had a rich meat sauce but was a little dry and I should have asked for some extra marinara sauce.  Will return.

Awesome locally owned spot with great selection of beer! We tried the sampler because there were so many choices new to us! The pretzel is so good, we ordered one to go!

Very well managed, very clean, really nice people. Front desk staff courteous and welcoming.  I saw Ramona today and her hands were gentle and strong enough to knock out ALL the kinks.  There was spa music playing and I felt totally relaxed. It is as well run as any hotel spa I've been to. At the end they give you a cold water bottle to help flush out the toxins. Great experience!

We absolutely love the Sunday brunch! As far as ambiance it doesn't get any better, just an awesome neighborhood place. Emily is so knowledgeable and knows the perfect time to check in and refill water. Loved the bacon cheese grits!!!  The pulled pork chilaquiles were fantastic and you can order a tapas size or entree size but the smaller portion was perfect. They have games and you can sit, drink and make it a Sunday fun day and don't forget a sorbet infused mimosa. Also you can linger on the back patio and have a relaxing environment, around the fire if the weather is cool. Live music for brunch. Just a great local place with good food.

How fun - loved it! The tableside gucolomoe just could not get any fresher and is most unique with dried fruit and pomegrante seeds. A must try with friends. We didn't sit outside due to the frigid weather but you can enjoy a plethora of outdoor seating. You can pick and choose which tacos you want and how many since they are kind of a la carte. Can't wait to go back.

Awesome place, we really liked the ambiance, warm and inviting. The aromas upon entering are fantastic! The artichoke appetizer was plentiful and tasty. The pork chop was juicy and very thick. The service was a little off but they've only been two weeks so I'm sure they will fix.

Such a cute quaint restaurant in an unlikely strip mall. Only 1 table to seat 6.  Super comfortable high back chairs in the bar area. Warm friendly greeting upon entering. Large and unique beer selection and we sampled a blueberry ale but decided on a mr pineapple wheat beer. Now the wine list is just inferior to the beer list. To be categorized as a wine bar is not accurate, a small and unimpressive list; average glass price $9 and bottle price $27. Go for the beer and you will not be disappointed. The starters and small plate options are typical of a wine bar, we especially liked the cantaloupe, blue cheese and prosciutto bruschetta. A unique item on the main entree were frog legs and they had lamb chops. Locally owned so hope they survive.

Fantastic hole in the wall, very clean!! Nothing fancy and you order and pick up at the front counter! The food is outstanding - Carne Asada was super flavorful and tender!! Prices are very reasonable!! Fantastic food and don't be put off by the lack of ambiance but a good sign that it's authentic is the TV is playing in Spanish!I if the salsa was a little bit better and there was no Styrofoam plates I might give it five stars!

This is the place to splurge in the East Valley! Foodie heaven - the wood fired porchetta and charred lemon butter beans -  it's tender, balanced, succulent!!! Note - Porchetta is not for those watching fat. The burrata - melt in your mouth,  scoop the burrata. We loved the candy bacon, duck egg over grilled asparagus - excellent execution!!  Anything pork and wood fired grilled is DIVINE!! Great place and our server Grace was knowledgeable and attentive.
