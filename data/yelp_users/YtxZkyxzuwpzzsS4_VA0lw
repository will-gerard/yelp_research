Zero if I could. Horrible customer service. Indifferent to the customer. Has this company ever heard of training?  Never shopping at Walmart again. I'd rather wait a night to go to target then come to this 24 hour pos.

Delicious, and plenty of options.  If you're in Vegas, and you want to hit up a good buffet, you cannot go wrong here!  There is plenty of variety, and it's all above average.

We visited town for my great grandmother's birthday, and the party was hosted here.    It was absolutely delicious!  I ordered the atlantic.  I love smoked salmon, and this was some of the best.    Did I mention they opened the place after hours just to accommodate our party?   That alone is 5 stars, but their awesome service, and awesome food sealed the deal.    Definitely recommended!

A little hard to find but well worth it. Very nice, and super quick service. Best part is the food is amazing. I highly recommend!
