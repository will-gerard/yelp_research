I ordered a supreme croissant.  I got an overcooked dried out egg, soggy croissant, no bacon, what the hell! It was like I got a day-old breakfast jack on a croissant for 3x the price.  I already got to work before I realized what they gave me and now I am in a bad mood.

I bought the chocolate and salted caramel cake for my wife's birthday.  It was beautifully done and taste fantastic.  It was a big hit.  Definitely coming back again.  At the time I ordered it I had not known they were only open for 3 weeks...this place is an up and coming star.
