Hands down. BEST BREAKFAST IN THE CITY!!    Pros: * The atomosphere is really chic yet still feels comfortable. * The service is fast! * The food is the best part... the buttermilk pancakes AHhhhmazing.  The "bird" omelete is to die for.  Topped with creme frache and loaded down with turkey, cheese and avocado... I have been dreaming about it!! * You will leave full.  I wish they would franchise and put a BC in St. Louis (where I live).  I would be there every weekend!

After visiting the Phoenician last week for our "Babymoon", I am not surprised to learn the resort is the #1 rated Luxury Collection hotel in the Starwood chain!! Wow! What an experience! My husband and I both work stressful jobs and we desperately needed some R&R before our baby makes her debut. I read way too many hotel and resort reviews before finally settling on the Phoenician. I was initially concerned about staying at the resort during Scottsdale's "off" season and worried the weather would be too hot for a 7 month preggo to enjoy the pool and sun.  However, after spending four days there, I quickly realized that off season is OUR season.   Because the resort wasn't at 100% capacity, we felt like we were given a lot of special attention (and maybe they make everyone feel that way all throughout the year). From the moment we checked in, every single person at the resort made sure our stay was exceptional. The ladies at the front desk were so kind and offered restaurant advice and appropriately commented on the nature of our trip. They even gave me a gift-- a Starwood Kate Spade golf bag! The bellman, the servers... Even housekeeping made our stay phenomenal. We all know you can stay in a beautiful building with the nicest amenities... But if your room isn't clean then your view of the hotel is diminished. The housekeeping staff at the Phoenician are some of the best in the country. We always had plenty of fresh towels, always replenished soaps and coffees, and the little extra touches like chocolate on our pillow and slippers by our bed at night was so appreciated.   If you stay at the resort, I highly recommend participating in the resort events and activities. As a non-yoga person, yoga was surprisingly one of the highlights of my stay. Susanna, the yoga instructor is amazing and truly teaches on every level--including altering her class so that I could participate (full belly and all). My husband enjoyed the cocktail lesson and we loved the live music at the Thirsty Camel at night (see my separate review on Yelp).   The bottom line of my review: Would we go back? Absolutely!!!

Great live music. Beautiful scenic views. The best service in town.  Sounds great--right?  My husband and I recently stayed at the Phoenician and made visiting the Thirsty Camel a nightly ritual.  The beer and liquor selection is excellent and the apps are great (try the dip trio!).  The prices are a little high (I recommend having a happy hour!) but the experience is worth it.  Bottom line:  Will we be back?  Gosh! I sure hope so:)

We were in route from Phoenix to Tuscon and needed dinner. I looked up a few places online and Eva's seemed like a reasonable option.  This restaurant has EVERYTHING it needs to be successful: * A cool atmosphere-- check! * a great menu--check! * Good drink specials--check! check!  Despite all of this, this was hands down the WORST Mexican dinner I have ever had in my entire life. (I eat a ton of Mexican food).  First of all, the service is terrible.  Our waitress did not know what beer was on tap, did not know the drink specials or happy hour dinner apps and didn't give us appropriate drink refills.  The food takes the cake for being just plain awful.  I ordered tortilla soup and one of the happy hour nachos, my husband ordered a combo meal and my cousin ordered a steak rice bowl.  After one bite of my soup, I was completely done (tasted like it was burnt), my husband and cousin could stomach a little more than me but still felt like the food was sub par at best.  I mentioned to the server that I was disappointed with my soup and all she could offer was to take it back to the kitchen (no replacement option or comp ticket).   Bottom line: Would I ever eat here again?  Nope.  Never.
