This is way better then the one they have on bell rd. Staff is more friendly and the food fresh.  CJ has waited on us and we absolutely love her. Great service.  Will be back alot.  I come here from west phx. ...

i have been here a few times thinking it has to get better.  but tonight was the worst.  we go for the crablegs.  it is an all you can eat buffet.  i brought two friends with me and we each grabbed a plate of crablegs.  the owner, comes up and says cant we eat something else the crablegs are very expensive.  i cant believe the humiliation we felt after only 20 minutes in this place.  i will never  recommend anybody to this place.    i need to find a new place.  i mean id rather eat at mcdonalds.....rude and humiliating.
