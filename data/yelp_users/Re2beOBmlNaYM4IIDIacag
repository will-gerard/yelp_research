Been going for years, some of the best sushi in town. Try the spicy tuna, climax roll, and first love, the Las Vegas and the amigo are awesome as well. The one in surprise is nothing like this location. I tried it and the sushi sucked. Go to this location instead. Nice affordable prices during happy hour and friendly staff. Small little quaint place but the sushi makes it worth it!

Awesome coffee, awesome atmosphere, if you really want to wake up, ask for the Lindsey. You'll be cleaning your keyboard with a q-tip and organizing your whole house in no time. They make a bunch of goodies and pastries from scratch that are yummy. The home made whip cream is d-lish!!!!

Anyone who gives this place less than 5 stars is in a bad mood or looking for something to complain about in life. Always treated right and the food is insanely delicious. Tenderloin Benedict for the win. Short review but don't doubt the place, just come in and try the food. You will come back after you have tried it once.

With such a famous history, I expected more. Went in with a group of 15 people expecting a good show. (We spent around 1500 dollars at this place) we got a random white dude as our chef..he didn't do any tricks... And any that he did try he would mess up and say "cmon guys to have to cheer me on here!!" Sorry man, we are not going to cheer you on if you can't even do one trick on the grill. There were people I was with who had never gone to something like this before... So it was disappointing. He even stacked the onions up and I told my friend next to me, get ready he's going to light it on fire!!! So he got his phone out to record it (other places do this) only to find out that random white guy was just going to scoot it slowly across the surface of he grill and pull out a whistle that sounded like small child's train toy, and act like the onions were a train.... Super lame dude. The food and show is better at AH SO and its less expensive and it's centrally located instead of driving all the way to chandler.  Waitress was nice, food was good, oh, and the bartenders need to learn how to make drinks, I shouldn't have to explain how to make any shots I order that are pretty standard... Step your game up BENIHANA!

Never had a spray tan before, wanted to look as good as possible for my wife for her 30th bday on the beach! It was an easy going experience and I received great value for what I paid for. I was on the trip for 5 days and it lasted all the way up until the last day, which was great because I was in and out of the ocean and the pool a lot. I paid 40 bucks and I can get another tan any time during the year so basically 2 tans for 40 bucks. I will come back. It was nice to actually look tan cause I am super white and it's very hard for me to get an even tan. Thanks again!!

Went in a week ago, nurse practitioner was friendly and she is definitely not the reason why this is a on star review. It's the events after my visit that has motivated me to write about this place. I went in a week ago with a very bad cough that I had for almost a month, after they saw me, they told me I had bronchitis, gave me my prescriptions and I was on my way.... I took every pill and prescription as directed. Once all the medicine was gone, I am still coughing, and still wheezing. I go back in 3 days ago, see the same nurse, she now tells me I have asthma. Ok, I'm willing to deal with it, have to go buy a different inhaler now... Which is 130 dollars out of pocket, and they prescribe me medicine that has to go into a nebulizer which is a breathing machine and it's something I have to take 3 times a day. Went to a couple cvs... Can't find any that have a nebulizer in stock.... The nurse calls me, tells me I need to find a place that has what I need because it is a "life saving" thing for me. So here is where it gets bad. Today I find a place by my house, they have one in stock!!! I show them my medicine that has MY name on it and says right on the label "take 3 times a day via nebulizer"... But it's a no go! Pharmacy says I need a prescription for a nebulizer. At this point I am HEATED. I call dr express, a man with a deep voice answered the phone which I later find out is the manager,  he is really short with me on the phone , I agree I had an attitude, but when I am constantly trying to find something that can help me BREATHE, wouldn't you be upset?! The "manager" keeps questioning me why I don't have my prescription and why he needs to fax another one somewhere,... I told him all my prescriptions I was written is at work ( next to the actual dr express location) and that is 50 miles away from where I am at the moment and I need something faxed over that says I can get a nebulizer so I can breathe....his response: "if your going to be snotty you can come down here in person and pick up a prescription yourself" and hangs up the phone. This is the manager huh? Quality! (Sarcasm)   I call back, lady answers phone, tells me that was the manager and he is too busy now to help me. And that I was NEVER prescribed a nebulizer. So I asked her... "Let me get this straight.... You guys told me this is something I need to breathe... But never prescribed me the actual machine I have to put the medicine into?" She said they can work on it but they are busy and maybe they can get back to me in an HOUR.... I was literally standing at the pharmacy... A couple feet away from a nebulizer and they refused to fax something over until they "checked into my charts" and cause they are "really busy"   This place is A JOKE and I'm going to go to a real doctor and even see if this diagnosis is correct! Still wheezing... Still coughing... Still don't have what I need to get better.  Update: after 2 days and me having to have the pharmacy call them again, they gave a prescription for a nebulizer. Upgraded review to 2 stars cause the manager that has no customer service skills ruined this place! Going to see some lung experts and see if this diagnosis is correct!!

Attention yelpers that whine about their experience not being "perfect" this is a sports bar, not the capital grille or a steakhouse. When everyone is saying "best wings" we are talking about the traditional bone in wings, of course the boneless wings are like "chicken nuggets" or "Tyson chicken" with sauce drizzled on them... Because those aren't real wings! They probably offer them for weirdos who don't like eating real wings...  Anyway.... The traditional wings "hot" and "crazy hot" are amazing.... We only eat the wings here and I have been picking up orders and taking them to my family to eat for two years, we tried a burger too before and it was pretty damn good. So if you go here, remember... It's a bar! Order some traditional wings and a cold beer and you will do just fine. The end!

We wanted a break from Denny's and the normal routine breakfast places, hoping this would be different. It was not. Service staff was friendly and quick, no issues with that, price was fair as well. Food was mediocre at best, the bacon looked like the cheapest one you can buy at the grocery or store... Or maybe it was the "ready to eat" pre-cooked bacon, not sure. But it was not good. The strawberries were not fresh, the "country fries" are thin potato slices that have no seasoning or flavor, had to pour a bunch of salt on them just to make them not taste like a plain sliced potato. The price was cheap so I guess you cannot expect much, I would pay more for better quality food though.

The food is good. Usually the service is fine, however now they have 3 employees that all have no idea what they are doing, all 3 of them in the front ask the customers the same questions instead of just one person being a greeter, obviously all are new and don't mesh well together. One girl has a very bad attitude and one customer was trying to tell her what he ordered for pick up and she wouldn't even look in his direction, she just seemed like she hated working here. She kept muttering under her breath the whole time that they are running out of supplies and seemed very frustrated. They all were discussing how to open up a bottle of wine, and how they were going to figure it out. Inexperience + bad attitude is not a good combination, there needs to be a manager that needs to step in quick to supervise these employees and get them trained and informed on how to perform their tasks so customers aren't put off by this. An older gentleman was kind of lingering around behind the counter and was not in uniform and was wearing a nascar hat that had nothing to do with the restaurant which is strange cause it just seems like a random guy is hanging out behind the counter...is he the manager? Is he a friend of the owner? Or the owner himself? Your guess is as good as mine. He was sipping on soda from the restaurant and walking back and forth with a few buttons un-buttoned from his shirt like he was walking around in his home....WEIRD! Good food is only half the experience when going somewhere, make sure you don't let this place go downhill! Cause the food is really good! Get your staff trained and up to speed! I ordered a to go order (4 dishes) and it took over a half hour.
