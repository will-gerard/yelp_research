Loved the food and drink!   The nachos with muchaca under the appetizer menu was GINORMOUS, it was so much food between the two of us, we could not finish it. The blue type margaritas that are presently on special for $2 a piece, all day, are fantastic.  Our server was super cool and on top of her game and for a total of four drinks and the increadibly large appitizer, we paid $27. How can you beat that?!

This place as a whole has bitter sweet memories for me, it was the beginning and the end of a very important and romantic relationship in my life. The atmosphere is so great, it is housed next to a gelato place and the two go great together. On weekend evenings in summer, they would have live music, not sur eif they stil do. The outside seating in the area is condusive to some great people watching. The coffee, hot or iced, is fantastic. If you are in the area, I highly recommend going!

So....it does not have the full menu options like that of a regular paradise bakery. IT is still great and has the basics, the problem is, depending on the season (IE- the blue hairs or younger types who are there due to weather or school schedules) can make the wait quite long.  Seating is open food court in the mall, which is loud and again, depending on time of year, difficult to find. Regardless, I stop here if I am in this mall!

Love the popcorn flavoring, the rocking seats and stadium seating!  I choose to go to this thearter more often then the one across the street, which is also an Arrowhead thearter but is an AMC.  Here they have the flavor topings for the popcorn and the seating just seems to be more comfortable. Come to think of it I cannot recall the last time I went to the thearter across the street....

I see a lot of low rathings and I am shocked.  The food is family style, so if you are not prepared to eat, don't go.  The chicken marsala is different, I had tried it here since I never had before, and it is almost like sweet & sour chicken without the sour. The baked ziti, was fantastic tasting!  We did not order a dessert, however, the sunday is bigger than the face of two people and has twelve pieces of brownie....the waiters have to hold it with two hands when they bring it out, so if you have a sugar attack, consider going for that - you will not be dissapointed.  The atmosphere is stimulating, pictures, paintings and portraits everywhere!!

Not bad, avacados on the salad bar? Awesome! While some of the seating arrangements just feel weird (we ended up sitting near what was an exit door, and it was hard to tell until people filtered out) They had decent prices, and the fact they had avacados on the salad bar, and they were fresh and green, was a winner with me!!

Love it!  The people are snarky in a cool way, they jab at you and if you play back you only get deeper into it!  I always go for the Global Scent Company, but the turkey legs as bowling ball are also AWESOME! Tried the sheppard's pie and had a beer with it, really good too! It can be pricey, but it is really worth it. I had my hair done at twisted sister, in like 7 minutes they had this elaborate braid in my head. The jousts is great, the shows I prefer, but are PG-13 to R rated: Don Juan & Miguel, Ded Bob, Dexter Trip (some of his are G).

Burger and shake were good, nothing to rave about. So what's to love? Great and fast service, even in a mad rush of customers, and awesome atmosphere! Kinda odd that soda refills are 40cents....but I got the Jamoca shake, which was uber thick and tasted great!  I plan to go back during a quiet time and see what it is like when there isn't a mad rush. I like those old time shops so I am a bit biased.

Expensive but I LOVE it!  Look, I am a Marriott rewards member, and while the rooms are expensive they are really nice, the 17th floor was awesome (by the way it goes from 12 to 14....like 14 isn't really 13 at that point). The breakfast had fresh fruit, and not the cheap melon stuff, the actual strawberry, raspberry and pineapple. I am a loyal rewards member and have yet to stay in a bad hotel!

I love this place. It is over run by the blue hairs in winter, but if you go after 6pm, you are pretty free. The food, fruit and veggies are fresh. They carry an awesome selection of bread, and I am addicted to the chocolate covered honeycombs.....YUM! Also, the employees are pretty cool, never had a bad experience!

I am telling you I don't think I ever really have a bad experience here. They took the Pollo Espinaca Enchilada off the menu, but there is one girl there, who usually works the drive through, who knows what it is. The chips are thin and warm, and I love the hotter salsa. Salmon was awesome and if you wanna go fattie style, the Pollo Fundito (I think I may have spelled that wrong) is AWESOME! I also have the girl and guy margarita cups, those suckers are HUGE and make my face go numb half way through. Keep in mind, I am a light weight though!!!

Very rarely can you go wrong here, my 800 calorie lunch is a testament to that!  Within the past year they changed their look and added to their menu. I love the grilled chicken sandwhich I had, and their baked potatoe soup, while not as good as the Corner Bakery across the Loop 101 to the East, is still great.  Their bread bowls are fantastic, but they tend to run out of them at night time hours.  I love the veggie omlet if you make it for the mornings, and my favorite cookie, their ginger molasses....I can eat those all day!!!!

This is true mid-west fattie food, and I love it! The best: thanksgiving dinner, on thanksgiving!  The food is always mid-west heavy, it is the food I remember eating in WI. They serve breakfast all day and there are different specials running through out the year. I cannot eat enough of the thanksgiving dinner, which runs though the weekend of the holiday. How can you go wrong when you can over eat just enough not to feel sick (which includes dessert) and some one else cleans the dishes for you?!?    Oh! BTW, you can now order a whole thanksgiving meal carry out here!  They also at times have this chicken wrapped in tin foil cooked in all the veggies, it is a special, but when it comes around, GO FOR IT!!!!

I like AMC's and this one has been pretty good. Going to check out their IMAX for Underworld, will finalize the review after. I was going to be a bit upset since they had no flavor toppings for popcorn, but the IMAX movie....WOW!

Not bad! Listen, ladies night has turned into ladies day, so ladies, go and all you have to pay for is any rounds you use and targets. You get a lane for free, and then you can also rent as many weapons as you want (one at a time) but still, I shot 3 different .45's and I fell in love with the Sig 1911. The only problem here is, #1, it is busy and lane rental can take over an hour if you are not a member, and #2) selection on weapons to buy is limited. Still, great merchendise great time, I really enjoyed it!

They are one of the few places around that can cut close enough for those military guys.... And I had my hair cut there, the lady was awesome, I don't normally trust a barber shop to do this, but you know what I would go back here in a heart beat!!!

It began two years ago. We signed a lease, and were so badly misquoted, I had to pay  an additional $100+ in fees the first month. Then, we were told we could not hang sun blockers on our patio, the heat in the single pain windows required us to buy special curtains, to keep the 2 bedroom apartment a scalding 80 degrees for almost $200.00 per month in cooling bills. The pool turned into a bathtub for the children, often having an off yellow color and high crime indicators of loitering individuals became prevelent. Now, after scrubbing down the apartment, paying to steam clean the carpets and paying numerous deposits, I am sent a bill, dated mid-December, received today (mid-January) and told if I fail to pay $143.99 in 14 days I will recieve action on my acccount. BBB....here I come!

Well, upon receiving a letter from management, they want confirmation from an agency we paid to have the carpet steam cleaned. I have seen their vans, from Carpet Genie, which look like child predator vans and their employees look like un-checked felons (I am almost sure they do not conduct back ground checks), and we purchased a steam cleaner and because of my cats, cleaned the carpets a minimum of three times. Why would they offer to refund my money if I had a receipt if the carpets were not up to par already? Then they charged for light bulbs, when I put in energy efficient ones, when originals burnt out. I am not sure if they think they would have charged me for a service call as a tenant when they did, but they sure are now. If you are military, STAY AWAY, they will use your need to get things moved as a reason to rack you with fees and allege they have "pictures" of the place, which in my case were not taken while either of us were able to be there. Oh, and don't bother getting a drink at the pool from the vending machine, if it does work it is a rarity, when it doesn't, Mr. Garcia has no clue about how to get your money back....why would he allow some one to put that on his property without ensuring it works properly and know who to contact when it doesn't? Because the complex is sheisty.

I used to love this place, the guy who ran it was cool, honest and helpful. After today's initial experience with this new counter guy, I was hesitant to leave my car, but will likely not be back....  The service ended up being okay, but like I said, whatever it was about the new front desk guy, I felt like I was being talked down to and like I was on the verge of being shammed. The place used to be open on Sunday's, due to staffing at the moment they are not, so don't even try to book an appointment on line for Sunday, they will redirect you.  I think I am going to find a new place to do oil changes and car tune ups...sad, I used to love going here.
