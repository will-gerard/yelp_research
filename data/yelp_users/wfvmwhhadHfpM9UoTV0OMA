We had the Sunday brunch.  It includes an entree and a seafood, appetizer, ad dessert  buffet.  The buffet was better than the entrees but everything was very fresh.  Drinks are very expensive but what the heck, you're at the Biltmore.  It is definitely Oooooooold money here.  We loved it. Woof!

We had brunch on Sunday and it was great.  The place looks great and the food was deelish.  It's a bit pricy but the ingredients seems all top notch.  We'll try to hurry back.

I've eaten here about twenty times and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  It is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley and top three for Japanese (Shinbay, here, Hana, maybe Roka)   The drink prices are great and even better at happy hour.  The sushi is great but so are the reasonably prices kitchen items.  If you aren't a piggy like me you can eat here very reasonably.  We love the owner, Yoshi.  Try the boars specials, always great!!

I couldn't agree with David more.  The owner is definitley an interesting  person.  The more money she thinks you make, the more she will talk to and love you!  So tell her you are RICH!! (Sorry Didi C.) As for the food -  Ho hum VN food at high for what you get prices.  The Pho is very avg and double the usual price. They don't charge a corkage fee for  BYOB which is nice.

Thanks, Joe for saving Gilbert!  Great, casual place like a slimmed down Dish urban market (RIP).  The pizzas have awesome crusts and without the wait! (take that Bianco)  NIce place to stop by for a quick bite.  I hope they opne up a grill too.

I'm Asian and love authentic, down home Chinese food but sometimes I get the hankerin' for good old Americanized Cantonese food like at Yao.  The owners are super nice and the place is clean and fast and the portion sizes are out of control.  Also $2 Tsingtao Beers anytime!!  It's easy to drive by and never feel like stopping in but the the place is great.  Don't Panda, Don't Pei Wei, Don't PF - go to Yao and support local, hard working folks.

This place is fantastic.  Not all of the food is incredible but I love the convivial atmosphere and we had great service.  Their drinks are crazy cheap (pitcher of Kirin $15!!!) and we stuffed ourselves.  I think their $9.50 black cod tased just as good as the one we had at Twist the night before on the $185 tasting menu.  I'm adding it to the Vegas rotation.  They're also open till 3AM :)

The first time I went here, the food was pretty good and I really had no complaints.  The second time - What the heck happened???  The name of the game that night was how much salt can you ingest in one meal before a stroke occurred?  Everything was a salt bomb.  Especially the seafood pasta where beside the gross, old mussels the only spice I could taste was salt.  The sad part is - I love salt!  I won't go back or recommend it to anyone who has hypertension.

Yes, the place is old and stale looking but every-time I'm there I feel  like being in a small town diner with all the folks that I know.  The coffee isn't very good but the food is tasty and not greasy.  The prices are low and the Serrano's are as local as locals can get. It gets crowded on weekends so come before 10.

We always try to go to Firefly at least once on our Vegas jaunts.  Reservations are a must as the place fills up with mostly the younger crowd.  I love bringing new people here to show that some Vegas places can still make awesome food for low prices.  The parking can be hit or miss when it is busy.  I haven't tried Drangonfly next door yet - next visit I guess.

Wife and I really like this place.  It still has its hole in the wall feel but is very popular and sometimes crowded.  The menu is broken down to a southwest fusion side and straightforward New Mexican side.  Both are very good and very spicy.  The brunch is very good on Sunday.  Priced can be a bit high but quantity and quality of food is very good as well.

We've eaten here or gotten take out many times from here and I felt it was time to put my two cents in.  It is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Chandler area.  The food is very authentic and the menu huge.  Almost everything that we have tried is awesome.  Stray away from the Americanized dishes d try the unfamiliar like the dry sauteed green beans and stir fried snow pea shoots.  You won't be sorry. (unless you like the Panda- then you will not like it)

The food here saved the evening for us as the service especially at the hostess stand is atrocious.  We had reservations and of course our table was not ready.  A teenager working the front told us to wait in the bar.  After 30 minutes, I inquired about our table and got the "And you are...." comment.  We almost left but the wife wrangled the manager who got us a table sans apologies.    Now for the good stuff: 3 course American Wagyu tasting menu Course 1 - Caesar salad, grilled shrimp, wagyu tartar Course 2 - NY strip and rib eye with asparagus, mashed potatoes, mushroom roast Course 3 - three deserts  Waaay too much food, and everything was delicious.  The beef blows my steaks on the grill away.  Our waiter was very nice as well and attentive.  Overall a good experience food wise.  The initial service was worse than at some mall restaurant (hey wait , it is in a mall!!)  Tsk, Tsk Collichio - you always are lambasting your chefs on TV about perfection.

I've lived where there are four of these shops in the same strip mall (Seattle, Houston)  and while Lee's isn't the best ever, the fact that it exists  and is clean and tasty makes me really appreciate it.  I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would order off the "American" menu....

Probably the best overall buffet in Vegas(for higher prices ones)  The waits can be long (and tend to bring out all that is wrong with human beings - pushing, line jumping, etc.)  The food is very fresh and there's an awesome variety.  Good place to get the gang to go when no one can make up their minds.

We shared a chef's table with two other couples recently at Alex.  The service was impeccable and to room was beautiful.  As for the food,  it was very good certainly but nothing too memorable.  I can only recall one course that I really enjoyed (lobster truffle pasta).  The wines( which we ordered a la carte instead of getting pairings) were good but had tremendous mark ups on them.  It was an interesting evening but not the best ever certainly.  FYI dinner for the two of us with gratuities hit 4 figures...The wife has forbidden a return visit.

the best dim sum in the East Valley. It is much better than C-Fuey.  The only knock I have is the lack of variety sometimes.Get there early or prepare to wait outside.

Dear Ken,  I love your restaurant because the cooked food is just as good as your reasonably priced sushi so that non sushi eaters (read-WIFE) still want to take me there for my raw fish fix.  But why, oh why is the service so slow and maddening?  Could it be you don't have enough servers to help your sweet, overworked staff?  And why won't you listen to me and open a branch closer to my house in South Chandler?    But I digress, love you like family, keep up the good work and see you Saturday.

Ambiance - "Old" money and I mean Old. Dress Code - Supposedly in place but lots of t-shirts and sneakers on Saturday night Price - Higher than other steakhouses.  They justify it I guess by throwing in potato (very good) and vegetables (forgettable)  Service - 3 servers per table and yet sloooooooooooow Food - Unimaginative sides, steaks pretty good.  It was pretty disappointing overall.

Thai food for me is one of the world's greatest cuisines.  Too often though it's pretty blah.  This place is by far the most authentic and best tasting place I've found here.  If you take away the ac, the front wall, parking, and general cleaniness, you could be sitting on a soi in Bangkok having dinner (and sweating).  Try some things you are unfamiliar with, you won't be sorry and heck the prices are 20% lower than other places.

Wife and I had the lunch buffet.  The food was outstanding everything was awesome especially the rice dish.  The food has some similarities to Northern Indian food so it seemed familiar to me but different enough to intrigue me.  The only con was the bread which I guess is traditional but I found very dry.  We will go back for dinner for sure.

Had the Omakase with the wife. Chef is a great guy named Roman from Munich. He comes by and asks what you don't like and like. There are four courses and each course is about 10 dishes each. The Sushi course was outrageous - the freshness unbelievable. Only bad - the flavored sochu is pretty gross and overpriced and the dessert was waaaaaay to sour (they replaced it). $350 for dinner but worth it for us and hey, my wife doesn't even like Japanese food really!! I'm coming back.

It is a bit expensive - I mean it's pizza for God's sake.  Beyond that though I enjoyed the food there.  The pizzas are BIANCOesque even down to very similar toppings.  For me it was about as good as Bianco without the ridiculous wait. Good place to kick back with good friends.

Molto Mario? Nope.  Molto Salate!! (Very Salty)   The theme for our overpriced dinner was obviously salt. Thinking we must be behind in our sodium intake, Carnevino graciously doused our entire meal in salt. The pastas we ordered (pasta with broccoli rabe) was so salty that some members of my party's heads blew right off. Then they served nearly raw meat (at $70 per person!! watch out - it doesn't say pp in the menu so you think it's for the both of you) The meat was good quality - but still moving around on the plate. Three plates back to the kitchen for re-fire! Wines marked up only 4-5 times retail so they do have a heart it seems. When we displayed our dismay at the salt level, our waiter just laughed nervously.   Oh well, at least we stimulated the economy.

Just had the BBQ on the terrace offered on Sundays during the summer.  It comes with an appetizer,salad, soup, shellfish buffet, an entree  with sides and dessert.  The food quality was fantastic (Kobe sliders, duck burgers, Olympia oysters, king crabs).  There are drink specials for $8. The cost is $49 which is expensive but I thought it was worth every penny.   The restaurant is beautiful and check out the bar.  Quite a change from the Marquessa.  We'll be back to try the regular menu soon.

We came for a quick staycation on groupon - highly recommended.  I also found a travelzoo deal for half off tasting menu at Bourbon steak.  It was $125 for two (for a $250 tasting menu for 2) - great deal I thought.  The problem was the restaurant clearly just gave us a $125 tasting menu for two.  Small portions, cheap ingredients.  Two bites of bland tuna tartar, two cappuccino cups of melon soup (sadly the best course), two beet salads that had about four beet pieces on it, two small sad pieces of tuna, three thin slices of some sort of meat on cabbage(!) without any sides, and two chocolate desserts (not too bad). But the kicker is they automatically added 20%tip to ... $250 "original price"!!  With a bottle of tasty chupacabra wine ($54) add extra $129 to the bill.  Fail.  Avoid.

Anyone who loves pork products like the chef here is A-OK with me,  Took some out of towners and sat outside on the patio.  It was 100 degrees but the sun was down and the misters from Metro brasserie cooled things down nicely.    First of all some seriously stiff drink worth every penny.  My buddy got a gin and tonic and they served a mini gin bottle and tonic separate so you can mix it any strength you want.  Genius!  The food was dynamite and requires an adventurous palate.  The wine list is crazy long and has some very cheap bottles on it.  Overall a fun night with friends at a very nice restaurant!

Great new addition to downtown Chandler.  This is an upscale Thai restaurant with a hip, cool interior.  The food is Thai and Thai Fusion and very good.  Try the awesome Halibut dish.  The owner and his mother really contribute to a friendly,fun atmosphere.  FY I- it's south of the wedding dress shop and the entrance is actually located on Arizona.  We will be back!

Wife and I have been here three times now(twice for brunch).  The food is very good and the decor is hip and stylish.  Each time we've been, it's been pretty empty.  It's too bad that locas owned places like this struggle and right outside the California Pizza Kitchen (yuck!) has a line.    We like the lobster burger ($18 here $30+ in Vegas) , cheese puffs, green chile, great service,and bar drinks.  I hope it sticks around.

We just tried the new BLT steak at the JW Marriott Camelback Inn last night.  It was their third day of service.  Despite that, we were treated to excellent service, great food, and awesome experience.  First of all, the resort is newly renovated and it looks incredible, like a lodge in the desert with views of  Camelback mountain from the patio.  The dining room is open and airy - not as trendy as Bourbon steak.  Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!  The Cote de Bouf for two entree ($86) was perhaps the best steak I've ever had - with bone marrow and bacon and mushroom ragout on top.    Sides were good as well as the salads.  Prices were high but I thought worth every penny.   Welcome, my new favorite steakhouse in town! (at least until the new one opens at the Phoenecian)

This place also has an excellent Korean-Chinese menu.  Look for the alternate menu given to the Asian folks.  They have dished that Koreans expect in a Chinese restaurant - has very little in common with American-Chinese dishes.

I hate to do this.  A Pho joint so close to home and yet so disappointing.  We've tried to give this place many chances and every time it's worse.  The Pho is just OK.  Anything else on the menu, especially if Thai-esque are abominations to Asian food lovers everywhere. The owners and their kids are sweet and I love Mom and Pop places but I just can't recommend this place.

We've missed Fogo since we left Houston in 2003.  Back then the price was around $50 and now it is $42.50 - yaaay deflation!  The food and service were outstanding.  Our experience was different from John V's in that the meats were cooked at a variety of doneness and when my wife wanted something cooked a little more (does that make her unsophisticated? - yeah right) they were more than accommodating.   It's a meatstravaganza!!  Also, webmaster - Kerstin M. Deserves the first to Review.

The room is so awesome with the view of the city through huge windows.  The food is top notch and amazingly, moderately priced.  This city is killing me with all of these awesome steakhouses.

Better central location on the strip than Four Seasons. Service was outstanding and the rooms are great though a bit small.  Loved the private valet entrance off citycenter for easy in/out.  Bar has fantastic  views and delicious cocktails (they'd better be for $20) Added perk - state of the art gym and quiet, infinity edge pool.

Since it's close to the house, I thought I'd give this place a try.  Tried an Angus burger and the wife had the sliders.  The food was in a word mediocre.  I've had much better burgers in a lot of places that made lots of other things besides burger.  The sliders were pretty bad with thin tasteless meat.  The prices are high as well.  Oh well, on to the next joint. Only if Delux could branch out to Chandler...

The food here is very good overall.  Happy hour is a very good deal. The menu is modern American and I really like the pasta dishes.  One complaint - The lobster salad has a ridiculously small serving of both salad and lobster - I understand the lobster but salad??  Four stars for me for the happy hour.

I have found it! A good indo/paki restaurant in Chandler.  A little hard to find just south of the Big Lots on Warner and Alma School rd.  The dinner prices are low. I mean hard to find anything over 7.99 low.  The portions seem small until you eat with naan and rice and then it really isn't.  Hands down the best naan I've had around here (because it's fresh and not overcooked)  The saag, CTM, Eggplant were all very good and spicy.  The owner is a cool dude who checks on you frequently and is a very nice person.  The decor is very bright.  For me could be a little cooler in the restaurant, but minor quibble.  Count me a fan - Will come back to try the rest of the menu.  The wife, who is a fierce critic of Indian food really enjoyed it.  Hooray for Chandler!

Had two breakfast and the sake Sunday brunch over labor day weekend.  The room is very airy and comfortable.  The service is excellent.  The food during the regular breakfast is expensive but fresh and tasty.  The brunch though...was killer.  The appetizer buffet had a fantastically fresh oyster bar with three varieties.  Each oyster runs $3-4 at most placed so do the math (brunch is $58).  There are sashimi and sushi and all kinds of app and salads then they pass around other apps and dim sum then you get you entree (Indian, Asian, American choices) then the desert buffet. Oh my!!  Juice is not included we found out ($8 each , ouch) That being said, I'm still thinking about is for our next trip!

Had Khao Soi (curry noodle soup) - hard to find and often bad -downright awesome, just like I had in Chiang Mai - turn out owner is from there.  Makes authentic Nam Prik (look it up) if you ask.  Damn! right here in Chandler, I'm tearing up. Going in the rotation for sure.

Not. Good.  Shameful Korean food and side dishes being served up to unsuspecting, nice white folks. Why is the soft tofu soup lukewarm?  Where is the egg?  Where is the stone bowl rice? Why are the side dishes so bad?    I'm ashamed for you, Red Kimchi!

We sat at the same counter space as our last (and only) See Saw experience.  The ambience, food, beverages, and service were all top notch.  Best plate of food was the braised leeks and fried eggs.  Also had some overlap with the post 10pm menu and they smelled amazing -  will have to come back for that.  Awesome people working there - it really makes the restaurant.  Hopefully they will keep on going strong despite the economy - all locals support our restaurants especially when summer slowdown hits!

Had the brunch.  It comes with pastries, a glass of champagne, a starter, entree and dessert.  Had the pizza and wife had fish.  Tasty although pizza crust got very hard as it dried out.  Ambience is very cool and chi-chi.  We liked it and will try happy hour if at the mall.

It's a Thai explosion in Chandler -  not that I'm complaining.  Me and the missus stopped in for dinner.  Service- terrible, atrocious, slow, haphazard.  Food - delicious, spicy, cheap.  It's a good thing I lower my service standard for Asian places.  The family next to us waited forever for their food and I gotta say, God bless the father who took it all in stride patiently and enjoyed the food.  Who says there are no good people left, I think Chandler is full of them!

They have the Best and cheapest buffet in this part of town served by the best and nicest servers.  It's still a buffet so not everything will blow you away but its all good and filling.

3.5 stars for me. Food:  Very comfortable and delicious food familiar to us Roaring Fork folks. Wine:  Reasonably marked up bottles to share. Service:  Sloooooooooow and forgetful. It's new so I'll cut them some slack Crowd:  Mostly Older folks, but that never bothers me.  Best part was the Green chili stew and the Ice cream and pecan pie.  Don't know if I'll schlep up for it from Chandler again but my friends live nearby so....

It's hot today. Not been too bad a summer til now.  Finished lunch at Lattitude 8 with the missus and stumbled onto Paletas Betty.  A memory tickle from growing up in Houston...Popsicles!!  Went in and got arroz con leche and missus got the mango. Price a little high (for a Popsicle) until you realize the thing is all fresh fruit or dessert!! Now price sounds just fine.  Betty is a cutey and my wife agrees! Get  your butt over there ASAP.  Plan to bring the Yorkies over next time.  If you eat over in downtown Chandler, skip dessert and go here.

We got off to a rocky start, they were overwhelmed by their newfound success on a Saturday night.  We sat down and waited and waited and waited for someone, anyone to acknowledge our existence.  We were the only Asian folk there but I guess we're not their target audience...Just before we were about to leave they at least brought water - which had a bug in it.  Oh Well, it did just open so we ordered away.  The food is very good and nicely spicy.  The apps are excellent and the menu variety is nice and interesting.  My Thai wife approved.  The space is beautiful and let's face it the rent in Gainey village must be astronomical which explains their higher prices.(they even charge for rice - our sticky rice was old)  Once they iron out their service issues it should get much better.  I can get Thai food nearly as good for cheaper in Chandler where I live but for a date night out this place will do nicely.

Good drink menu and good neighborhood place but not a destination restaurant be any means.  We enjoyed the food, especially the halibut.  It's tucked into a side street and is easy to miss.  It would be hard for me to go here instead of FnB since they are so close togeather.

Terrible rip-off.  Fried frozen food really sucks.  The wings were bad too.    (try Blu32 instead  haiku lovers)

It's probably the smallest restaurant in Arizona.  There's only six seats in front of the sushi bar next to the bar.  We went when live music was playing and it was waaaay too loud for us.  Now on to the good parts.  The chef and his assistant couldn't be nicer and genuine people.  I could tell they really wanted us to enjoy the food.  The food was fresh and delicious and portioned just right.  The prices were a bargain compared to other omakase I've had in town.  Next time I think I'll ask them to sub some Nigiri sushi for the  first courses.  Oh and did I mention five wine and sake pairings were $15!! We will definitely be back.

I just don't get this place.  All the food comes straight from Cysco and falls into their fryer and onto your table.  The wings are lukewarm.  The service is bad.  The lighting is terrible.  The place looks dirty.  My wife had the fried fish and shrimp.  The shrimp were tiny and obviously from the frozen section of Costco.  So were the fish.  So were the curly fries (but those are damn good anyway)

So sad.  We live nearby and though we would throw some local business their way.  Wife is Thai and the food is bad.  It is edible but I can't tell if they are bad cooks or just adjusted so much for White folks that the food barely tastes like Thai food.  So, So sad.

Like the other reviewers have said the service is really not that great.  Luckily they're saved the  really good food that they have.  We ordered so much food that our little two top table  couldn't possibly handle it all.  The mussels  might have been the best I've ever had. We also shared a Frito misto, which is really good except they're pretty chintzy with the shrimp they only gave us too.  The pastas were clearly handmade which appreciate and they're quite good. The owner came over to check on us a couple times which I appreciated.  I'm definitely coming back soon.

We really liked it at lunch before we flew off to Vegas.  My wife loved the filet steak special for lunch and my steak salad was great as well. The coconut pie we split was ridiculous - in great taste and size. I'm surprised by the poor reviews and if the girls working there don't mind what they're wearing,(not that risque really) why should you?

The whole process was very professional and well done.  I had Xpel ultimate full hood placed onto my Cayman s and partial protection for wife's cayenne with clearshield.  The work was done exactly as promised and on time.  Shane clearly takes pride in his work and is a stand up guy.  When he noticed flaking from a bumper part, he offered to pay for it even though it is under warranty and I really don't think he did anything to cause it.  His prices are very competitive as well.  I drove from Mesa to see him because of his great reviews!

Scott is the man!  I've never even met him haha because my wife always takes the cars in.  She raves about him.  His labor charge is half of the north Scottsdale dealer and his parts cost have to be even less.  He is always honest and only charges for necessary parts and labor.  Thanks to azpca website for recommending him.  If you absolutely need a not so great lounge and a loaner car then I guess go to the dealer and pay more than double!  Otherwise,  go see This man - he clearly values YOUR time!

Amazing fettucini with truffles! The rest of the dishes were pretty good Our waiter disappeared for awhile and the room alternated from hot to cold over and over again but we enjoyed it overall.  Next time, I'll stick to the pastas.

Been several times for $30 massage for 70 bucks.  They are foot specialists but do the whole body as well.  If you Arne not used to asian style foot massage, know it is very, very strong and can be painful - just ask them to ease up a bit but you feet will thank you the week after.  The ladies are very nice and free massage after 10th one!

They just opened in the Egg and I location. They are slammed and the wait is loooong for food.  The smoothies are very good and fresh.  They made the space open and nice with an open kitchen.  I'll give them the benefit of doubt for the wait bc it's new.  Onto the food. Not too shabby, spice level very low, salt level very low befitting the hood.  It's better than what was there before and I'll give then another shot.  I hope they spice up the food a bit once they settle in!

Long wait on Saturday night but worth it!.  Drinks are strong ( and too sweet just like NOLA) and the sauces are oily, spicy, and absolutely delicious.  We has crawfish, oysters , and lobster.  The fried food were overly fried but the rest was a messy delight.

Service department -  I don't know why I always fall for this crap -  your service will take 20-30 minutes so why dont you have a seat and wait.  Then an hour and 45 minutes later - the car may show up.  Just friggin tell me the truth and drop me off somewhere or give me a loaner.    Sales department -  love Tino, sorry Tino.

This place is fantastic.  Go after dim sum.  Owner is great, the place is clean, and the snow ice incredible.  Enough said.

It's a must stop for me.  Stupid cheap drinks and friendly bartenders.  Hell I even won at the video poker!

Clean place with friendly owners. Prices were fair and their sauce is cleaner and less garlic forward.  Their fried foods are excellent and they must be using clean oil.  There is ample parking and the combo bags are good deals.  Next time In Vegas, we will be back!

Super dead on a Friday night. The appetizers and fried rice for nothing to write home about. But then, the chicken came and it was absolutely delicious. It's too bad it's in an awkward location set behind Chandler Boulevard because it's really good place. The server was very friendly, And the prices were very good. For some reason we also got 10% off. I definitely plan on coming back with a large group of people so I can take advantage of the karaoke. I sure hope more people fill this place to keep it going because the fried chicken is vastly superior to other places.

I've been there twice now and I really enjoy this place. They actually have excellent service and the side dishes are really great. If they find out that you're Korean they will give you a few more more "Korean"side dishes as well. Definitely try out the braised  cod dish as it's our favorite now and it's absolutely delicious. Right now beers are on sale for four dollars and the server are really excellent and friendly (unusual for K restaurants, trust me)  I'm really happy that this place opened.

Great new Filipino joint!  Prices are very low and the portions very large.  The food was wonderful as well as the owners.  I had the lechon kawali, pancit palabok, and the lumpia and it all tasted awesome.  I will definitely be back!!
