Unfortunately, the experience with Allstate Appliances has been very disappointing, time consuming, frustrating and bad! I do not write bad reviews normally but in this case I need to let everybody know not to buy anything from this dealer.  I bought a Subzero wine fridge in mid August and it was delivered and installed in the beginning of September with the wrong front. The front door was 84 inches instead of the ordered 80 inches. The installer, sales rep and sales manager at Allstate have all agreed that they delivered and installed the wrong door.   After endless phone calls, text messages and also visits to the showroom, talking to first the sales rep Ray L and then the sales manager Mike, being promised that they would "take care of it", which they never did, I finally contacted Subzero directly.  Subzero informed me that Allstate Appliances had lost the Subzero dealership contract on September 5. This being absolutely no excuse for how Allstate have treated me as a customer but might be one explanation. I would imagine that the reason they lost the dealership is many complaints similar to mine which you realize when checking reviews for them.

I just love this place! The genuine western ambience is outstanding. We always take visitors from Europe here and they all LOVE it! The bull riding just tops off the evening!!

I have the best nail technician ever at Elite Nail saloon - Kathy!!! She is always so sweet and nice and does the most amazing pedicures and manicures! Love her and the whole atmosphere at the Saloon! I also appreciate the warm reception arriving! I find myself going here more and more often!

Beautiful hike! The trails are VERY organized and smooth. I would easily give it a 5 star if it wasn't for bad signage to find the trailhead. Fix that and this is a 5 star!

A friend of mine, she is French but lives here in Scottsdale, took me to this genuine French restaurant. I had the Quiche du jour and it was heavenly good! So happy to have found this place since I really have missed good food. I will be coming back a lot!

I love going to Renegade for a drink in the bar. It has got great atmosphere and is not as noisy as many other bars! The 5 stars is definitely for the atmosphere even though I also love their bar menu.

Had a great dinner at Black & Bleu last night! Used to come to this place when it was Renegade and just love the atmosphere, specially in the bar!  The King Salmon and Halibut was excellent. Their signature Bleu Burger delicious. The cob salad had a great taste even though I found a couple of bones in it... Very nice and friendly service, but yes, the service need to improve (that's why a 4 star) but I figure it is a start up issue. This is a great addition to the restaurants in the area and we will definitely be back!
