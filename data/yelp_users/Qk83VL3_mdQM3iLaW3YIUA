We spent our ninth anniversary here! The food was delicious! We each had the four course meal with endless meat. We added our own desserts with the curtains closed...lol. Very fun!

I have eaten here several times and normally have a pleasant time. However, this time we had a waitress that was slow and we had to keep asking for more "endless" fries and refills on drinks. It is much better when the waitress is paying attention. It would not have been bad, but the restaurant was slow and should not have been that way.   The food was still tasty. I got the A-1 peppercorn and it was very good. Just wish the service would have been what we were used to there.

My wife and I recently stayed here for our anniversary staycation. We were very satisfied with the stay. The room was excellent. The bed was clean and comfortable. I had read reviews of the low water pressure in the showers, but I had no issues at all. The hot tubs within the butte were amazing. We went at night and could look out over the city. The service was great, too. Everyone we talked to was pleasant. Unfortunately, we had to pay for parking and internet which should be included in the price of the hotel; however, we knew this in advance. We would definitely stay here again.

The course was in decent shape for the price paid. However, the service is lacking every time I come here. It seems like the pro shop is always run by a grumpy old man who hates being there and answering simple questions.

I love this place. There are tv's all around and the food is awesome. I always get the roasted turkey melt. The service is a bit slower than most places, but it is worth it.

My family and I come here about once a month. My wife and I normally share a large salad with steak or chicken. The sweet pork is good but too sweet for us. The salad is excellent with the tortilla torn and eaten with it. You will not be disappointed.

Today was my first time visiting this great sandwich shop. I got the #5 sub sandwich...basically the italian sub. The sub was full of meat and their special sauce was so good. It was some sort of garlic and vinegar sauce. They have a lot of choices and the subs are affordable.

This was the second time that I ate at Zoes Kitchen. The first time I had the Protein plate which consisted of grilled chicken on top of some cabbage and onions I think...not for sure, but it was good. Today I had the Steak kabobs and they were amazing. They came with vegetables and potatoes. Each with their own seasoning and cooked to perfection. I will most likely be coming back very soon to get the same dish.

The seasonal raspberry white chocolate chip pancakes are amazing! It comes with eggs, bacon, sausage and hash browns. You will not be disappointed.

Still my favorite burrito place! I love the steak burrito with their smoked chipotle Tabasco sauce. They are always making sure that the customer is happy. We were in this location last night and it was a bit slow, but nothing to complain about. The cashier apologized and gave us a buy one get one card. I will continue to go to places that care about the customer so much.

I went here based on a recommendation from a friend. I had the bacon and blue burger with fries. The pretzel bun was very good. The burger was average, but the other burgers on the menu sounded good, too. I will go back to try the others.

Of all the courses here in Scottsdale, this is the one that I frequent the most! First, the scenery is amazing when golfing around Camelback Mountain. A few of the holes are extremely elevated and make for a fun round. Next, the outside service is great. They are always kind and do a great job getting me started. Last, they have 3 different nine hole courses which's make it a different experience often.

Pizza is amazing! I've come here several times. Like the idea that I can choose the toppings and the price does not change. Will keep coming back for sure.
