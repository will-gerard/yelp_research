We find ourselves here most Saturdays for a big bowl of teriyaki chicken with brown rice and all white chicken meat. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious.  The restroom could use some updating but it's in an older strip mall so sort of expected. They take phone orders as well.

Not impressed. This was my second time here. The first time the staff was helpful, however today was the complete opposite! Brenda attempted to help me with my issue but was not professional and came across as combative. They may have the parts, but if the staff is unwilling to assist customers in a professional manner you might as just order the parts online.

Usually this Outback is great, but not today. My family and I go here every couple of weeks and usually the food is terrific value and friendly staff. Today we went the waitress didn't bring any bread and didn't come back to check on our drinks. My husband and I both ordered the Outback special medium. My husband's came out fine, but mine was hardly cooked and rare. When I asked the waitress that I would like mine cooked more to my disbelief she told me that is how they make the medium. After showing her my husbands medium steak cooked how it should be she took it back to be cooked more. Not a good experience. My guess is she was having a bad day or just new to waitressing.  I don't think the staff should argue with the customer about how cooked the steak is. Just take it back and cook it properly.

How many Sam's club workers does it take to figure out the price on an item? None. They are clueless. Sam Walton would not be impressed. Went here to pick up some items and grabbed a bottle of wine that was on display and clearly marked $6.96. It rang up as $7.58 so I told the clerk. She then asked another cashier to call for a price check. Five minutes later the clown they sent to do the price check said he doesn't see a price for the item. Check out the pictures I posted, clearly labeled $6.96. I offer to walk back and show them but they are too lazy so I walk back myself and take the picture and bring it up to the register clearly offering relevant proof of their error. They are absolutely baffled. Some of assistant manager gets called in and he doesn't know what is going on either and states to the cashier "I don't care just give it to them". Classless. On top of that he does nothing to fix the pricing problem that will inconvenience other customers in the near future. Whatever general manager runs this store needs to better educated his/her employees to handle types of situations like these and fix problems when they are identified.

We purchased a used vehicle and took it here to get the fluids checked and just for them to go over the vehicle to make sure it was in good working order.  ( we know where to put the gas in and that's about it)  Unfortunately for us, it had other issues either the seller didn't choose tell us or know about.  Adam, the store manager helped us prioritize the items that should have our attention first and other things that could wait until later.  He also told us that they have a service for around $60 that they would look over a vehicle you are wanting to purchase and they will tell you everything that is wrong with it.  Definitely will use that service in the future, Before we buy our next used car...   Was impressed with his thoroughness and kindness.  Will surely be back.

One of the best places in Arizona for fajita lovers . Cadillac fajitas are a must try here. The Cadillac fajitas are a little more expensive than the regular steak fajitas but a better quality meat. The tortilla soup is also great. They will even give you extra tortillas to take home. Good stuff!

Extremely slow service. Ordered a hamburger waited 30 minutes and waitress was M.I.A. Got up and left. Unless you like have a lot of time to kill, I would avoid this place.

My family and I love coming here.  The food and wings are delicious and the crust is very flavorful.  The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing.  When we want pizza, this is the place we go!

Andrew at Congress Realty is a true professional. We listed our home and had multiple offers the first few days and our house under contract within the week. Andrew is bar far the most knowledgeable and responsive realtor I have ever dealt with. He helped us navigate through the entire home selling process for only 1/2 of 1 percent commission a savings over $7000 of what we would have normally paid! If you are looking to save money when selling your home and looking for realtor with a wealth of knowledge negotiating contracts I would recommend Andrew English at Congress Realty.

If you are looking for taco's that have about 1/3 of what they are suppose to have in them, this is your place! Wrong orders and very unreliable. Disappointing.

9:15 on a Saturday. Not a soul moving in the APS building and all these lights on and they charge high rates for us during peak demand. They must get free electricity at this joint. See picture as well

Come to this location about once per week. Staff is always friendly, great service and food. My personal favorite is the Spicy Chicken lunch with fries. It is even available for breakfast. Highly recommend 5 Stars!

Had not been here in years and thought I would give it a shot. Place has been remodeled with a great look and new menus and waitress was very friendly unfortunately those are the only positives . The water tastes like it came from old rusting pipes, beef fajitas are tough as leather boot and tortillas are cool. Kicking myself now that I didn't go to the Chipotle 1/4 mile away. I would avoid this place unless you are looking to just have a drink. Food is no Bueno.

Be prepared to wait and then wait some more. Waiting an hour in the lobby and then another 30 min in the waiting room. There where only 2 people ahead of me. The X-Ray technician may have been been having a bad day, but was very unemotional and not empathetic. I even heard him tell an older lady who was in visible pain to hurry up while walking to back. If she would have been my mother he and I would have had some words. The PA was friendly and seemed knowledgeable but took less than 5 minutes talking with me. Overall not impressed.

These "savvy" business owners managed to take my box fee and then close their location along with hundreds of other customers. I think they had a few hundred boxes in this location so they basically stole thousands of dollars. Postnet corporate is not willing to do anything for the hundreds of customers. Franchise owners were Walter R Young and Alicia Young. Property records indicate that they recently sold their home and more than likely skipped town. The research I did online it appears Walter is a complete tool with an eight grade education that is a Tea Party gun toting member that thinks there world is ending. Great job doing your due diligence PostNet corporate on potential franchises and supporting the hundreds of customers Walter Young ripped off.

This is the "cheese pizza". I thought commodity prices where heading down? Apparently not, these folks are rationing the mozzarella! Maybe next time I will the order the extra extra extra extra cheese. Make it look and taste like a pizza guy, not a big bread stick with tomato sauce.

This is the second time we have used Door Doctor and they continue to impress us with their professionalism, and skill.  We sold our home and are renting for now.  Unfortunately the garage door opener decided to quit working shortly upon moving in.  We passed on Door Doctor's contact information and a quote to replace the opener to the landlord. He decided to purchase an opener at Home Depot and have a Handyman install the door which took him and his wife 5 hours to put up.  The door worked for a week then the cable on the side came undone and the whole door became slanted and would not close.  Again we told the landlord to call a professional, licensed company to fix the problem.  He sent out another Handyman that proceeded to beat on the door for 45minutes to try to get it closed.  He gave up and told the landlord he needs to call out a garage door company.  The landlord finally got in touch with the owner Ron at Door Doctor and got him out to fix the door.  He had it closed in 15minutes and it back up in running in a little over an hour. This company knows what they are doing and will get your door up and running again!  We really appreciate them being so patient with our weird situation, would highly recommend if your door is needing some attention.
