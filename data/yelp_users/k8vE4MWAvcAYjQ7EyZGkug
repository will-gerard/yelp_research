This was my second time trying Venezia's. First time was during an office staff meeting. I had chicken pesto both times.  I am normally a very harsh pie (pizza) critic... Having been born in Europe, I have high standards set for what a pie should taste like.  However, Venezia's has definately been able to live up to my grand expectations. I must agree with the rest of fellow Yelpers, this pie is to DIE for!! We definately been blessed with a slice of PIZZA HEAVEN!! :)  So... get in your vehicle and take your hungry butt to Venezia's. You will not be disappointed!!

I have to agree with Erica M, this place should not be getting the same praise as it did before Laura and Lisa left. I went here a couple of months back and needless to say, I wont be returning.  I dont like to give negative reviews (especially for local businesses) but this time my negative experience justifies it.   I know that it was partially my fault for not noticing the mistakes when I was handed a mirror but my skin around my brows was still red. When I got home, I've realized that my eyebrows were NOT the same width.   If that is not bad enough, my right brow was overplucked (inner side) by half of a pinky's width! Horrible experience!! I really hope that they get some more experienced employees or they will not be able to keep their clientele.  So, just as Gabi and Erica M have, I too will be following Laura Smith to Brow & Beauty Boutique!   P.S. The ONLY reason why I gave this place two stars was because I was able to walk in without an appointment and they have entertained my husband while I was getting my brows done.

City of Tempe and its residents should be excited to have this place around!   Awesome burgers and fries, wine or beer on tap, help-yourself condiments bar, chill atmosphere, indoor and outdoor seating, super affordable prices that are specifically designed for small budgets (college students), great service, etc.  The only con is that it's on cash only basis but they have an ATM machine inside.

This definitely IS the place to get your hoagies from!! On their website it states, "What is a hero?" You might ask yourself. Well, come try one. It's what others call a sub, hoagie or grinder, ONLY BETTER. What some call a sandwich, we call a snack. What other places call double, we call regular. We definitely don't skimp." Yeah, they definitely don't skimp on ANYTHING!!   The quality of their bread and meats (Boar's Head), dressing, and customer service is spectacular. Ah yes, their customer service... You will definitely get that East Coast vibe- be a part of the family- yet don't feel offended if you hear a cuss word or five- and better know what you are going to be ordering cause this place is not for the indecisive.   I haven't tried many Heros because I usually stick to my favorite one of all, a Po' Boy Special (ham, salami, bologna and American cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and your choice of dressing). It costs $7.95, which is extremely cheap (not saying that you should be raising your prices but I would still be getting my Heros on even if you did) for the quality AND the quantity.   The only downfall to Hero's Factory is that they are only open from 6 AM - 3 PM Monday to Friday, so I am not able to go there as often as I would like to. However, my husband does work downtown (night shift) and is able to bring me some before he heads home.   To Nicole and Jay, and to the rest of the team, thank you for all of the Heros. :)   P.S. Hero's Factory has made my Best of the Best ONLY list, of course.

My husband and I met a couple of our friends here for a business lunch.   Our waitress was super friendly and seem very knowledgable. She was extremely patient even though it took us at least 20 minutes to order.    We started off with beers. Hefewiezen is delicious. (A German-style wheat beer that is crisp and refreshing. This light and sparkling beer is known for its signature aroma that suggests cloves and bananas).   However, if you cannot choose your favorite flavor, I would suggest The Sampler. It gives you a sample of all five beers in the shooter glasses.   As for the actual food (remember we were here for a lunch), we wanted to step outside of our 'comfort zone' so we decided to order something that we usually would not.   I had Lobster and Shrimp Mac 'N Cheese (Our twist on the classic mac 'n cheese. Saut√©ed lobster and shrimp tossed in a creamy parmesan-havarti cheese sauce with bowtie pasta - $19.95).   All I can say is... WOW!! This dish should not even have words mac 'n cheese in it because they don't do it any justice.  The flavors definately blew my mind! For all those who (heart) cheese, pasta and seafood, this dish should be a must!!  My husband ordered Blackened Mahi Mahi Sandwich (with Cajun remoulade, baby greens, tomatoes and Garlic Fries - $11.95).  Neither of us eat Mahi Mahi often but I must say that if I ever had a craving for some Mahi Mahi Sandwich, this would be a place to go to. Once again, the flavors blended perfectly. The only negative comment I would have about this dish is that it was a tad bit peppery for my taste buds.  All in all GB is great place to go to. We definately will be back, with or without our friends! ;)

I love coming to Yogurt Jungle with my husband! I must say that it is one of the best self serve frozen yogurt places around.  They have a great selection to choose from: 50+ toppings, and 10 flavors that are either low calorie or low fat. My favorite flavors are Alpine Vanilla and Pistachio but you will not be disappointed with any flavor that you may choose.   Their prices are reasonable ($0.39 per ounce) but ounces will add up after you add all of your favorite toppings to the frozen yogurt. Do not be surprised if you pay $10.00 for a large cup. However, you will not regret coming to Yogurt Jungle and will most likely return to it many more times! :)

In my opinion, this is one of the best restaurants on and/or near Baseline Rd in Tempe.  Their service is great! You will be greeted from the time that you step a foot through their door. Unfortunately, per today's so-called standards this is not a very common courtesy.   If you a first time customer or a returning customer, you can ask the person behind a counter to recommend a meal for you or you can ask for a minute or five. As a very indecisive person when it comes to choosing an item from a menu... I really, REALLY appreciate it when I do not feel rushed when it comes to making such an important decision in my overwhelmed life. :P  I haven't tried too many things from their menu because I usually stick to my favorite: Award Winning Gyro Lunch/ Dinner. A plate of delicious slices of beef and lamb, carved off the rotisserie, served with fresh toasted pita.  Lunch is served with your choice of the sides... Oh, and did I mentioned that their prices are extremely affordable! $5-$13 price range!!  So, enjoy your meal and make sure that you do get a chance to turn around as you are walking out because they WILL thank you for coming!  Kudos to you... my dear My Big Fat Greek Express owners and employees for making my oh-so-many dining experiences pleasant! I shall forever cherish thee!!

I absolutely (heart) smashburger!! This is definately a place worth raving about.  We have never been to this place before but decided to give it a try since it was on our way to the movies.  This is what I call a BOMB burger joint!! You know that you found a great burger place when you feel that you need a freakin' bib in order to eat there.   Everything is absolutely delicious and fresh. Meat, veggies, fries... Mushroom and Swiss Burger is a burger worth trying - more than once.  smashburger will now be on our regular rotation! ;)
