Easy to get to via Light Rail and if you have a USAIRWAYS ARENA event ticket, you can ride the light rail for free!  I went here for a WWE wrestling event (I will never go to another btw, it was terrible.  Im not much of a wrestling fan in general, but I can't imagine it would be fun even for die hard fans...).  So there was kind of a weird seating layout for the arena as well.  I want to go back for a more 'normal' event like a suns game or something and get a better feel of this place.  Seems nice though!

Went for the Yelp Ultimate Science Fair, and this place was really sweet.  I think we had the most fun playing around in the Human Body area.  There were many great exhibits though.  I look forward to going back sometime when I have more time to fully experience this place!

Wow this is a really cool place.  Im not sure if the Duck would qualify more as a deli or a grocery, but its got a pretty wide selection of products.  Nice selection of beer and wine and  cheese.  The architecture of the building is pretty neat as well! I stopped by here for the Local First event and it was really impressive!  There was a beer tasting going on on the patio of the bar and samples of cheese and tea provided for free.

After numerous visits, I must admit this dive had grown on me. It really is a good dive and with a $4 bacon blue burner how can you complain. The owner is awesome and a great host. The drinks are cheap at all times. They have a touchtunes juke box.

I liked the food and had a good meal. The decor and the seating arrangements were a little off though and I never really felt comfortable. Its tucked away in a strip mall so I guess its one of those place you have to know to find and they were busy.

I ordered their lunch specialty, prime rib sandwich.  A roast beef sandwich from subway probably has about the same amount of flavor as this thing did.  All I could do to try and awaken my taste buds was lather on some horseradish and au jus...  Maybe I picked the wrong item, but when I order a 15$ sandwich I expect quite a bit above average, and this sandwich was average at best.

I'm not usually big on chinese, but this place is doing it right! Nice clean feel upon entering, and I was promptly greeted by a friendly man whom I would guess is the owner.  The menu was easy to read, and the prices are fair. I ordered won ton soup and moo goo gai pan.  Both were great!  Would definitely recommend to friends!

Fast and friendly!  I actually saw another patron introducing his family (he was an older gentleman with his wife and middle aged son and his family) to the staff of this BK.  I have never seen BK bring someone to tears, but that day it happened.  The man had genuine love for the staff of this place and they all knew him as well.  Fast food greatness.

You really can't go wrong when you eat here and order the thin crust pizza, I've never tried a flavor I didn't like.  If you want the chicago-style pizza, be prepared to wait, they take about 45 mins to cook.  Also, the desert cookie is really good, big enough to split between 4 people I would say.

Thinking of Dilly's focaccia bread makes my mouth water... Seriously this place is great and Ive been here or the other one in Tempe numerous times and never had a bad meal or bad service. Personally I love the Yahoo (on focaccia of course!) or if you want something a little lighter, go with the Southwest chicken wrap.

Who cares if its a chain?  As far as bang for your buck is concerned, Outback has always been good in my book.  It was a packed house when we got there, so we sat at the bar and Paige was our bartender and she was great.  She helped us get the table we wanted quickly and was very friendly.  Blake was our server and he was great as well.  Food was all very tasty.  Had bloomin onion, filet with wild mushroom sauce, and prime rib.  While the prime rib was a little tough in some places, it was still very good overall.  Good prices, good food.

This is a cry for help. I feel like this place is destined to be a place on restaurant impossible. From the start there were issues. We waited at the front to be seated for several minutes while there were only a couple tables filled. I think there were only 2 servers working which was clearly understaffed but also seemed like its probably normal.  The food was bad. As in, my chile relleno tasted ROTTEN. It was filled with some gross greasy cheese mess and had doubly greasy batter that it was fried in. I honestly wouldn't have fed this to a pig. I probably have more to say but I feel that any more effort is unnecessary and would be a lost cause.

The food is good, I usually go for the ultimo burrito.  They have a nice fresh salsa bar with peppers and limes.  They also give you a bag of chips to snack on with your food, which is nice while you wait for them to make your food.

Tried to overcharge me for a double cheeseburger and then when I tried to explain to the manager what happened they seemed to not have a clue how to fix (I had to explain it to them about 4 times for them to understand and then i pretty much had to spell out what they should do to make it right).  The place doesnt look very clean and I would consider this to be below the standards for most burger kings.

We had a small group go in for snacks and drinks after visiting the 13th Floor haunted house on the other side of the mall. We got a table on the patio and when we ordered with our waitress, she wanted a credit card or for us to pay as we go. Now maybe this place has some sort of problem with people walking out on them, but if thats the case its probably because of staff like her. When I questioned her about it she tried to give us some half hearted sob story about why it needed to be done. I guess at this point realizing I was pretty irritated and wasn't going to do either of the options she had given me, she offered up another server which we gladly accepted. The next waitress was much more pleasant and friendly and [shockingly!] didn't require a credit card deposit or to pay as we go.  Overall it was a pretty bad first impression, but by the end of the night I was satisfied. The fried zucchini was pretty good, I wasn't too impressed with the fries or the garlic bread that we got though. The beer was nice and cold!

Stumbled upon "Taco Tuesday" - buy any drink (alco or non) and get 2 tacos for ~$7.  Our party all partook the special offer and were all pleased with the results.  We had an array of taco flavors, my personal fav was the tenderloin (beef), while I found the chicken to be a bit dry.  The chips and salsa they serve pre-meal were fantastic, really great flavor in the salsa.  Great place

I was driving around and BAM! hit a bump in the road and spilled some coffee on my shirt.  I stopped by this place and asked if they could clean the stain out really quick and the nice lady said she would try.  A few minutes later, she returned with my shirt, spotless and ready to go.  I asked how much I owed and she said not to worry about it!  Def. recommended.  (Their regular prices seemed pretty good anyways though)

This place rocks!  Decked out wall to wall with authentic sports memorabilia and pictures of the celebs who have stopped by, it has a great cozy feel.  Their bartender, Shelly is world class.  Don, a managing partner, was nothing but gracious and hospitable and readily offered conversation.  The rest of the staff were all friendly and  worked well as a team.  The food was outstanding.  I had the prime rib which was perfect and a jumbo twice baked potato that was spot on.  I will certainly be back!  THANKS DON!

Great ambiance, nice open kitchen, big booths.  This place was really nice (and really packed at lunch time).  I took some suggestions from other yelpers and went with the prime rib and it was really good.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  I would recommend this place for sure.

I have really wanted to try this place out since I had heard about them flying in their seafood fresh daily.  The place has a unique look as well, with just a small portion of the building being exposed above ground. Walking in, I was immediately impressed with the maritime feel that the decor gives.  The food was good.  My date had the crispy grouper which was really good, and I had swordfish with mango salsa.  For me, the swordfish was good, but I felt like the mango salsa was a bit overwhelming and the entire plate could have used a little more.  We also had a shrimp cocktail appetizer - good - and a chocolate lava cake for dessert - this could have used some ice cream or something, but the waitress actually informed us that they dont have vanilla ice cream at all.   Overall dinner was very nice.  The prices are expensive, I'm sure this is primarily due to the cost of having fresh fish flown in daily.

When I first started frequenting this place's Sunday night happy hour, I loved it.  I would go with a group of friends, and it was always a great time.  Over the last few months, I have seen a decline in the quality of food, service, and an increase in prices.  Happy hour is still pretty decent prices, and the food hasn't been bad, it just isn't as good as it used to be, unfortunate really.

Best bar in Tempe.  There is no place around brewing better beer (try the peach ale!).  They have very tasty food as well!  I like to go with the fish n chips or maybe the southwest egg rolls.  Beware my fellow Chi-Town sports fans though, this place turns into a Vikings bar on sundays...

I went to this place to kill some time one day and sat at the bar.  The ambiance is kind of "dingy" for a sushi bar, which for me is a real turn off.  When I am eating raw fish, I want the place to FEEL clean (and of course actually be clean as well).  I wasnt very impressed by the service the bartender provided either during what was a slow time of the day.  Overall, I would say you are better off hitting up some of the other nearby sushi place if you have the craving.

I stop at this McD's sometimes for breakfast when Im in a hurry and they always impress me!  The service is always fast (I always use the drive-through) and my food has been hot and fresh every time. Ive not been inside, so I cant speak for that aspect, but the service and food quality is above average in my opinion for McDonalds.  Not sure what that other review is all about... I mean really, who drives 15 mins to a late night McD's for a coke (and doesnt immediately taste it when the get it! LOL)...??

This place annoys me so bad...  It has potential to be a decent place, if it werent for a few major problems.  First, they charge a cover like every single night... (and as someone else said in a review, im pretty sure the doorman probably just pockets the money anyways...).  Secondly, their bartenders are terrible... if you can get them to stop bs'ing with each other or some drunk old hippie for long enough to order a drink, its like you just asked them for a kidney.  They all look like they just had a meth party before work and havent eaten in a few weeks.  They dont have any food or TV's so if you arent going for the music, forget it.  I can walk to this bar in less than 5 mins from where I live, and still have it on the bottom of my list of places to get a drink.

You seriously cannot go wrong if you've wound up at this place.  Everything on the menu is simply fantastic.

Because its so small.

Stumbled upon this place through yelp and was not lead astray!  I had their signature roast beef sandwich (I forget the name) but it was delicious.  There were only 2 people (myself and one other customer) there when I ordered and it seemed to take quite a long time to get the food.  I got mine first (took about 5-10 mins) and the poor other guy there didn't get his sandwich till I was almost done with mine!  Not sure what the problem was, but I would hate to see this place at lunch rush... probably want to order ahead!

Good pizza, went with a large group and was able to try several different styles.  Heres what I had: Diavola pizza, The Vortex pizza, Southwest Chicken Pizza, Hawaiian pizza, Classic Gluten free pizza,  They were all very good!  My favorite was the Southwest chicken, and my least favorite was the Vortex (too "olive-y" for me, but a it was a couple of my friend's favorite).  Oh and the salads are really big, 4 people shared a small (appetizer portions)! One negative about the experience was the waiter though.  This kid just didnt seem to know very much about anything, and wasnt very attentive to our large group (10 people).  When a friend asked about a beer he was unfamiliar with, the waiter described it for him, "Its from California.  Its good."  when he asked about another beer, his description was very similar (although slightly more helpful), "Its our darkest beer, its good."  Maybe they can educate their staff a little better about their menu.

Cool bar, bike friendly, good draught selection!  Told the bartender I drink everything and that he should pick me a good beer, the result was a great suggestion that I enjoyed thoroughly.  This building's layout is kinda odd with a loft and a couple side rooms set up with dining tables.  This results in a cool ambiance and a take-me-back-to-the-golden-years attitude.  Love it.

Wow, this is my 100th review!  And what a great place to get it!  There is a dog park area near the corner of College and Curry, with restrooms and park benches.  A really nice sized park with some mountain bike trails going through and some nice short hikes as well.  Great views of the city if you will climb up a hill and some small ponds you can fish in.  Theres so many great areas of this park, and they all have different character and atmosphere, you cant go wrong.

Lots of fun, just bring your cash. As with seemingly everything now a days, the prices just keep climbing at the state fair. Some of the rides now cost the ticket equivalent of over $10 for a ride. I saw a food vendor with a $20 Turkey Leg (wrapped in bacon) and a $30 combo of that item. Am I crazy to think a bacon wrapped turkey leg and a basket of fries from a street vendor shouldnt cost that much? Ok well Im a scrooge for sure so I wont waste this whole review ranting about the prices. The Fair is always fun though and is one of my favorite places for date nights. Theres pretty much always something new to see each time you go and the experience is great.

Ordered take out for lunch.  Had the BBQ sampler lunch with pulled pork, beef brisket, and pork ribs.  The brisket stood out amongst the meats and was very good.  The pork stuff was not that impressive.  Overall I felt the food was not great for the price.  Had a beer at the bar while I waited which was very cool.  Decor to entertain.

The bartender was friendly and attentive but not annoying. The food was good and served in a timely manner. There were numerous TV screens with good picture quality for us to watch the MLB home run derby on.  We took advantage of their 2 for $20 deal that gives us an appetizer to split and an entree each. I was pleasantly surprised that the entrees were full portions and not downsized for the promo. Nice place overall.

Mill is a unique area and a great part of Tempe.  It has its own character, love it or hate it.  Some business plans thrive here, and some that seem like sure things fizzle and disappear.  Lots of good bars and shops. Go here during the day to grab lunch or do your banking, or go for the nightlife, with Thursday through Saturday nights being the best.

Love this park!  Always great events going on here, especially during the Fall months.  The ~5 mile path around the lake is great for jogging or bicycling.  This is my dog's favorite place to run!  The new pedestrian bridge is now open adding a new crossing point at the Tempe Center for the Arts (Which is an awesome looking building and a great part of the park).  The lake is stocked with trout during the cold months but the fishing permit for them is kinda pricey (you can get it at local sporting stores like Dick's).

A nice change of pace from many of the other Old Town spots.  Cozy bar for cold winter nights.

The spot is really cool looking, a bar nestled up against the lake tucked into a corner of a larger building. I stopped by with a couple friends to have a quick drink. After quite a bit of a struggle to get someone to take our order and get some drinks, we enjoyed the time on the patio and the seats were a little old but still comfortable.  Once we got our drinks, we never saw our server again. Once we finished our drinks and were ready to leave, I wandered around trying to find someone to pay our tab with for nearly 10 minutes before abandoning hope, guessing the total of our order, leaving $20 on the table and walking out. I couldn't believe it. I read some other reviews now for this place, and it seems like this is pretty commonplace type service here.

I've been here several times now to take advantage of their Monday night special of a bottle of wine and a bruschetta for $20. It has been a blast every time thanks to the people I am with. Maybe we're too dysfunctional to get quick service, but it usually seems to take longer than you would expect. We aren't ever in a hurry though so its never a been a big deal. Im not sure which bruschetta is my favorite, but it's definitely the ones with meat! Forget the vegetarian options IMO.

Their prices are hard to beat, but I feel like every time I enter a Walmart parking lot, its like entering a war zone. I have seen some seriously disturbing stuff go down at Walmart, including people (yes, more than 1) peeing their pants in the check-out line. Usually its not that bad and everything works out, but you never know when you shop at Walmart!

Its cool.  The hike to get to it is not even a hike, the hole offers a nice view of the phx skyline.  You can climb around on the rock, but besides that theres not much to do here.

A solid "college bar".  Good specials, and lots of fun stuff to occupy your time while you drink (such as shuffle board.)  Nice patio with TVs and a good number of seats. The bar is not a very efficient shape, but a small negative among many positives.

Tried out this place and sought out their italian beef sandwich. It was a monster and nearly impossible to manage eating. Glad I had this one to go... probably would have looked crazy trying to eat it in public! lol

One of Mill Ave's shining stars.  Cons first - drinks are not that cheap, and I havent really seen any specials there.  Ive had their food once and it was mediocre (mussels and some sausage app that was more like hot dogs...).  Lastly they often have a very long line to get in on their busy nights (20+ min wait to get in the front door is not unusual on the weekends).  Ok, now the good stuff - beers, lots of good beer on draft including Guinness, Smithwicks, plus several other decent choices.  When they have the irish bands in there its really fun and a great atmosphere.  They have a good sized patio (that just got a lot bigger with a new addition) that is good for socializing.   The staff is all pretty friendly and the bartenders are pretty quick even when its packed.  Love the inside bar and barstools they have for it.

This trail is near my parents house and have only hiked here a few times. It's a beautiful park, this is not too difficult of a hike so everyone can do it!  The view is amazing because there are other cool mountains surrounding this area. The name, Sunset Trail, really does fit the park.

Nice poker room.  Its big with lots of tables, and well managed so you can get a seat quickly.  Lots of TVs and some fair promotions usually.  Best place to play poker in Phoenix for sure.

Very tasty wings! The drinks are cheap as well.  We all got wings and everyone was very happy with them!  All of his flavors are really good (we didn't try the honey mustard) and the heat levels are not some pussy chain restaurant rating either- Fire is Fire!  My gf got the philly cheese steak which she loved.  The place is really small, but its got some TVs and a dart board and its really chill.  They deliver as well.  I will be getting my wings from here from now on!  We had 7 people with us and Larry (Mister G, the owner) came out and talked with us for about 5 mins while we gave him our praise over his great sauces.  He is really nice and I always feel better supporting businesses that have good people behind them.

The only thing saving this place from a one star rating is the pleasant decor.  The "hipster" staff was anything but pleasant, the food took forever to get and was nothing special.  The waiter was unattentive and moved about the same speed as a turtle.  The bartender gave me a dirty look when I asked her for some change so I could go add time to my parking meter (since the food was taking so long...) and then made me wait about 5 mins while she tended to other guest before she got it for me.   Ok, so since the begining of this review, and reliving my experience as I wrote, Ive decided that this place does not even deserve the two star rating I had originally planned on.  One star, this staff is horrible.  Don't make the same mistake I did, go somewhere else.

Beat the blazing challenge (12 of their hottest wings in 6 mins) along with 2 other friends (3 of 4 finished, 1st try).  Sooooo - their wings were undercooked (not raw), you know, the kinda slimey, stickey chicken skin as opposed to the ideal crunchy, dry skin.  Ive also eaten their other wing flavors (Hot, Spicy BBQ) and was not impressed with the flavor of the sauce (and again the wings were undercooked).  The one good thing this place has going for it is that there are LOTS of TVs and they get all the football games. On a side note.  I know several people that work (or have quit) here and have heard horror stories about how their management treats their staff and would advise anyone looking for a serving job to look elsewhere before you look here.

This place has improved immensely since when it first opened.  The cooks seem to have finally learned how to cook, and the waitstaff seems a bit more competent as well.  Mozzarella sticks were good and the Southwest bites were tasty.  Not sure what it is about their wing sauce (buffalo) but my stomach is always in knots the next day... I might not consider myself a wing aficionado, but Im probably pretty close and I havent had the side effects I get when I eat here anywhere else.  And it happens every time I eat their wings.  They do taste decent, just not sure if the product is worth the price anymore (and im not talking $$).  Best things about B dubs = LOTS of tv's, they get UFC ppv's, they have most football games and other sports on at least one tv.  Decent selection of beers, and they have games like golden tee and that trivia game to play if theres nothing on tv

Ok, so this place is pretty nice looking, and decent sized, a bit of an odd layout though...  I felt like you definitely paid for that.  Opening night, THURSDAY, and NO SPECIALS.  I mean really?  This is still a college town right?  5 bucks for a (warm) beer, 6.50 for jager, and the typical 8 bucks for patron...    The dj wasnt really sucking me in either...  Overall, Id say this is a nice place with some potential as long as you arent looking for cheap drinks.

This place has gotten much more appealing since they first opened!  The staff seems much more broken in, and I think they may have adjusted their drink prices some.  Either way, the atmosphere here is great on the weekends.  The patio is big and has a bar but the shape of it makes it just a little awkward when its busy.

Just stumbled upon this one while doing some errands downtown.  Needed a snack and this ended up being a perfect choice!  They have a great tapas menu that is actually priced decently for how tapas should be ordered - in bundles! :D  The drinks are also priced reasonably and the staff was friendly.

The Short Story: The management is unfriendly and unapologetic if their staff makes mistakes.  Jenna, the lead bartender, trains the bartenders to intentionally pour the draft beer with extra head so as to give customers less beer (I've heard this is because of a bonus system the place uses for management).  Her personality is abrasive and in general she is not pleasant to be around.  If you see she is the bartender (she is a tall woman with shortish hair and tattoos), I would suggest getting a table instead of sitting at the bar.  I used to be somewhat of a regular here, but the attitude of the staff (management and bartenders especially) is so rude and unwelcoming that I have no desire to ever go back again.  There are plenty of other businesses in the immediate area that will actually appreciate my (and your) business.  If you want pizza on Mill Ave, you're better off hitting up La Bocca (across the street) or try Slices (on 6th street). You could also go around the corner to Oregano's on University Dr.

strawberry-banana smoothie with energy booster = money in the bank.  I got one for my girlfriend right after she quit her job and it made her feel much better! Very clean, and a great looking selection of toppings for the frozen yogurt.  They had a coupon for a dollar off when I checked in with yelp also, very nice.

We had a great time here for a low key birthday dinner. The service was spot on, the server's recommendations all proved to be excellent.  We had the calamari and the chef's plate for apps. The plate was awesome while the calamari was average. The seafood risotto was dumbfounding as you couldn't even take a bite of the risotto without getting a piece of some sort of fish along with it - shrimp, scallops, lobster (by all means a good thing.)  The pasta trio was also very good. The mushroom ravioli was by far the star of the plate. Great place, recommended for sure.

Love this place!  Great (short) hike with a rewarding view at the top.  The old mill on the west side of the mountain give the park some history and character.  The huge concrete "A" that resides on the south-facing side give the place the nickname "A Mountain" and has a long history to it.    You can see all of the valley pretty much once you reach the summit.  Look down on Sun Devil Stadium and Tempe Town Lake, or look to the west and see Phoenix's downtown and Sky Harbor Airport.

Nice place, lots of TVs.  I was here for the first time on the night of the ASU vs UofA football game so I feel like the experience may have been somewhat less than authentic, but it seems like it would be a decent place on a normal night still.

This place was accommodating to our large party (We came in about 15 deep after a yelp event nearby... needless to say we were boisterous and thirsty!) with a section on their sidewalk patio.  It was late and they were not very busy.  The staffing was light at that time and the waitress had a hard time properly serving us along with her other tables though.  We still had fun and the food and drinks were tasty!

This place is great (especially for a chain!).  They have a nice bar which is where I prefer to sit, with nice hd tvs.  They have a nice booze selection as well (including Hennessy- my personal fav). They have a salad bar which always temps me, but I can't say no to their ribs! They are sooo good (much better than chilis or any other chain I've had). The new tacos are also awesome. If you want a good app, go for the spring rolls or the quesadillas. I always substitute dessert for drinks so I can't really help there, but I'm sure they're also good!

The Capital Grille apparently knows how to pair wine as well as they manage their promotions. The Generous Pour offering was a tremendous experience for understanding the importance of a well matched plate and drink. The fact that they offer this to everyone for $25 (I think) all summer is amazing. Check this out for sure

Really great huge shopping center. Like Costco, but without the membership. That also includes the 'no credit card' policy- so bring cash or your debit card! Really great pricing on their products though and usually worth it compared to the 1% cash back from your credit card
