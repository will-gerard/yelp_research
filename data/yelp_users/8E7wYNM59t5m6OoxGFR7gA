Pizzas and burgers at this place are awesome. Been here half a dozen times and every time it's great. Highly recommended.

Cheesecake is hit or miss for me. The first few times I came here I wasn't impressed. Then I found the Chicken Madeira. This dish is amazing. Since then I've tried a few other dishes that have been hit or miss. For a home run every time, go for the Madeira.

Pretty disappointing. The crepes are good, but I had a burger and it was pretty gross. Over-cooked and the toppings were super plain. Don't expect to be wow'd.   If you just want a crepe, then this is your place. The ambiance is lacking and looks like it was put together with a shoestring budget.

Hands down the best sandwich in Scottsdale, maybe the entire valley. It's tucked away and not a great location, but the inside/decor is great. It's a small place but there's plenty of seating. The menu is small with 6 sandwiches, some focaccia bread, salad, and some desserts and drinks.   I've only been there once and got the #4 which is a Prosciutto San Daniel. It was amazing. The focaccia was incredibly flavorful. The combination of the meat, veggies and olive spread was the perfect combination.   I can't wait to return. My new favorite sandwich spot.
