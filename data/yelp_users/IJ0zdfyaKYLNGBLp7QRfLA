ARIZONA SOUL FOOD.  Love the food and atmosphere. A great old school Mexican joint. Nothing fancy just great Mexican food.   The chicken nachos on happy hour could feed 3-5 for $5. Serve their iced tea in big cups. Margaritas in big glasses and chips and salsa that will blow your mind.   Try the cheese crisp with guac or anything with guacamole... It is to die for.

This is an amazing New Mexican food restaurant. Very good chips and salsa. Great for groups. Always had really good service here. Friendly management.   The cheese enchiladas are amazing. The best I have had. If you love spice this place is for you. If they tell you something is hot.... It really is. Tacos are really good. The quesidillas with green Chilis are to do for. The hatch green Chilis here can not be beat.   Great food for a great price.  You have to check this place out you will not be disappointed.

Pizza here is really good. The price is excellent. I'm glad someone finally took ownership of this pizzeria. In 2005 it was summer the worse Service and pizza I've ever had.  My mom lives here so we started eating frequently on the side of town. Rush Street street is now our go to pizza.

Amazing pizza from a amazing local family. Support local chains and the best pizza in the valley!!   The slices are amazing , get pesto the crust. Love their wings the Joe sauce is amazing. My recommendation would be a pepperoni, sausage and meatball slice with pesto on the crust... So amazing

This is the best filibertos in Gilbert. Great service the food is always hot always quick. I actually drive past two other filibertos to hit up this one. The rolled tacos are amazing in California burrito is to die for.  If you're driving past stop in and get a California burrito you won't be disappointed

3.5 stars. I'll start off with the good. The bagels were amazing. Like best I have had awesome. Soft and chewy. Cream cheese was awesome. Wife had bagel melt and she loved it. I had bagel sandwich it was stellar. We ordered a cheese bagel with jalepeno cream cheese to give an accurate review. The sandwich and melt came with tasty little muffins. Awesome. The food again was stellar. And literally the best bagel I have ever had.  Being a bagel place they should have a good iced tea product. Both iced teas the had were TERRIBLE. We live in Arizona to me Iced tea is a must. They chinced on tea and I could tell. Call a China Mist rep.  The store feels crowded and cluttered and to make things worse, no tables were actually wiped off and the floor was full of crumbs and paper. The bathrooms were filthy and not attended to.  We will definetly come back to see if the place is a little cleaner.  But again kudos to Kokobelli for making the best bagel I have ever tasted.

Good food and a really cool atmosphere. The breakfast burritos are really good but pretty pricey.   Local haunt always busy but worth the wait. Bring your dog to the patio as its pet friendly.

Of all the Chinese places in the area, this is the best. Tastes fresher, is less greasy.

Over priced pizza. Snotty service. Been here 5 or 6 times hoping it will get better each time.  My wife politely asked for a side of ranch and the server scoffed and told her they don't serve ranch. Way better pizza all over gilbert, cheaper too. Skip this place.

Awesome hot dogs. Fun hole in the wall. Vienna Beef products. Bagel dogs, corn dogs, fries all great. Cash only so bring some green.   Same woman takes my order every time. Eat here before you judge.

overpriced and the food is average to below average. Crab cakes tasty super fishy and the beer was not cold. Salmon was ok and the garlic fries were WAY too garlicy. And I love garlic.  Try somewhere else when in the area. This is a overpriced chain restaurant with average to below average food.

More consistent then most little Mexican joints around here. Cheaper than a filibertos. Their tacos are very good. They are .99Â¢ Tuesdays and it is always busy. I always have the carne asada or a cheese quesidilla and they never let me down.   They can tens to be a little bit slow but overall the Service is good and so is their food.

I love filibertos in general, but this location is very hit and miss, this goes for the food and the service. They recently upped their prices , which is fine but the quality of the food should have least stayed the same.  More times then not the inside of my carne asada burrito is cold, not lukewarm but actually cold. Their breakfast burritos are very good and so are the rolled tacos. but if you have a choice, choose a different filibertos or even a whole different Mexican place.

Great food and a great value. Shrimp burrito and fish tacos are amazing. My wife had a chicken quesidilla and it looked awesome. Salsa bar is all fantastic and chips are crispy and not greasy.  Service is friendly and prompt. Really great healthy alternative to traditional Mexican food.    The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the tables were not cleaned and I think there is some confusion in whether or not you are to clean your own plates off your table or not.   Will definetly be b back.

Staff was great. Dr Singh was horrible, disrespectful and rude. Sending official documents regarding my experience to the office as  as the board of physicians.

Love jimmy and joes. This location is no different. Wings are great slices are huge and amazing the specialty pies are all so good.  Try getting pesto on the crust of your slice. Makes a great crust even better.  Don't forget the one of a kind Joes sauce. Out of this world. Don't believe the haters. I got nothing but love for JJP.

Unbelievable Fish and chips, best lobster bisque and calamari I have EVER had. Lobster Mac and Cheese was really good. Bloody Mary bar looked great.   This place is amazing. Really good service. You should sit at the bar at least once and watch the steam pots and the chefs at work.

Calamari was great, lobster taco was amazing and fish and chips were very good. Homemade cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and salsa all worth the trip alone.  Awesome local joint with awesome food and a fun atmosphere.
