I want to give CPEC 5 stars due to their customer service.  I visited CPEC thinking that it was part of my eyecare insurance network.  However, when I arrived the staff advised me that it wasn't.  My fault, I had changed jobs and should have looked at my new network's providers.  Long story short, CPEC pro-rated my exam which I thought was more than fair being they could have charged me full-price.  The exam was very thorough and  staff very courteous as well.  Thanks for a great experience and excellent customer service - I'll be back even though you're not in my network!

For me getting prompt service from a dry cleaners is good, but these guys are ROCK STARS!!  They are always super friendly which is greatly appreciated.   Thank you - and keep up the great work!

I was there for a busy Monday night game and was extremely impressed with the service.  I give kudos to the owner who actually plans for big crowds.  The interior of this place is fun.  If you have kids they'll enjoy the model train that travels around the place.  (I secretly wished it would poor beer when it neared my table, but......).  If you're a Packer fan than go no further as this seems like it's Packer headquarters.  We had the wings and mushroom burger.  The food was good, but a little cold.    Overall though it was a fun night with good service!

Do you drink coffee in the afternoon?  I don't (I know...a sin, a sin).  However, unlike most other coffee shops, they understand that sometimes people just want to come to a place, chill, read the paper or fire up their kindle and NOT have coffee.  So they serve smoothies, soda and flavored water.  I only drink coffee in the morning so this is great!  The place is very well designed.  The main area has a good amount of tables, yet there's an oasis away from the main part for those wanting a quieter spot.  It also has plenty o' plug ins.      Overall a great coffee shop, I go out of my way to visit it due to the atmosphere and variety of beverages.

I hadn't been here in a couple years and had some time off, so wanted to visit my favorite local coffee place....wow what a difference a couple years makes.  First I got in and there were several people working behind the counter.  Instead of helping, they just kind of looked at me for a couple minutes like I was bothering them.  But the worst was the service.  I couldn't connect to their WiFi which is one of the reasons I came.  After asking someone behind the counter if she could help, she just said "well we haven't had any problems".  What about the problem I was having?  I just took my drink and left.  Obviously I wasn't the only one.  There was another guy in the parking lot with his laptop out next to me leaving.  I asked him if he had any issues connecting and he also was having the same issue.  It would have been an easy fix, but they just really don't care.  Btw, it's definitely not my computer having issues, I"m typing this from one of your nearby competitors now.  ;)  Service has really gotten poor here and I won't be back, too bad.

Just got back from going into Zias for the first time. I wish I would have found this place earlier. They have a great selection of about anything you're looking for (DVDs, CDs, vinyl and BluRay) and some things you may not be looking for, but are certainly cool. Personally, I was impressed by their selection of funny fridge magnets. But they also have other stuff like music collectibles and TV series sets (Seinfeld, etc).   I traded in about 60 records and received a great price. Their service was fantastic!   Thanks everyone, I appreciate your excellent customer service. I'll be back.

I like to write good reviews with positive feedback, but this isn't one of them.  The food here was only subpar.  After dinner, I was hoping for a knock your socks off cannoli to make up for the food, but they were bland and fairly tasteless.    However, what made it a forgetful evening was the lousy service.  Our waiter was extremely rushed.  When we asked to see the wine list he said "you just tell me what you'd like and I'll tell you what the brand is".  Really?  We can't even see the menu?  He didn't even give us a chance to view the prices.  The same for desert, he was so rushed he couldn't get the flippin menu, he could only tell us what they had.  We had to ask 3-4 times for water.  Here's a hint to the staff:  When it's 100+ in Phoenix, people will want more water.  REALLY an unsatisfying time.  For a much better experience, hit Tutti Santi (I prefer the one on 16th street).  The food is superior and service outstanding.

So I walk into my Optometrist with a white cane, dark glasses and German Shepard...they knew they were in trouble!  Ok not really, my eyes aren't that bad yet.    You know how sometimes you visit the Optometrist and you feel like a number or they try to oversell you in buying some glasses?  This is not one of those offices.  Besides the normal eye check to ensure you're not blind, Dr. Kessler suggested some simple treatments to help decrease the redness in my eyes that I experience due to allergies.  It has really helped!  No other optomotrist has suggested this.  Thank you for a great visit - I'll be back!

I went to Monti's with a group of people very diverse in age. Since I was there plenty early I got a chance to visit both the bar and the dining area.  The place has some great history and it was neat to read some of the memorabilia on the walls.  My favorite was the cow picture...you'll have to go there to read it.  The bar area is great.  It's separate from the main dining area and has a good casual feel to it.  My bartender provided good service.  They have a limited number of beers, but their selection is diverse and will probably suit most people, plus, it was happy hour...woohoo!    Here's a summary of the dining experience: Food:  Very good.  My steak was good size and sides delicious.  They have nightly specials and I ordered the fillet which came with 2 sides ($12.99).  Very reasonable. Promptness:  Very good, was a busy night but our meals arrived in about 15 minutes Service:  Our waiter was noticeably proactive with water refills and had good recommendations (didn't upsell like another review mentioned).  Recommendation:  If you're in Tempe looking for a good steak house, I strongly recommend Monti's.  You won't pay $80/oz like other steak houses, but if you have money to burn then please contact me.

I will say this - if you are in the mood to shop for overpriced Hawaiian shirts at a store while getting terrible service at their restaurant, then this is your place.    I went there with a very large group and the service was terrible.  We sat at the bar for 10 minutes before I asked the guy behind it if I could order a drink.  He actually said, "Well sometimes".  The problem was not the wait staff, but the manager.  Don't put your employees in a situation where they are short staffed.  We called ahead of time to advise them of a large group and you just chose not to staff it accordingly.  Also try to teach your employees to smile at least once in their shift.  They looked annoyed that we were bothering them.  I'm sure this is a good place when they are not so busy, but my review is to skip it.  They really don't care if you are there or not.

A summary and suggestion for virgin Maggiano's customers:  Summary 1.  Service was spectacular.  Our waiter refilled our water glasses several times and really knew his stuff.   It was my friend's birthday and she found some extra cookies our waiter had thrown in when she arrived home and unpacked her to go container.  2.  Food - um....delicious.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and was not disappointed.  The meatball was as big as my head and very tasty.  3.  Drinks - fantastic.  I had the red sangria (don't tell my Irish brethrin) which was delicious.  4.  Atmosphere:  Classic Italian.  It's no Maestros, but it's also no Olive Garden.    Suggestion: Get the $39.95 dinner for two if you go with someone.  You actually get one very large meal (which you probably won't be able to finish) AND a to go meal which you can freeze, feed to the dog, or whatever else you decide to do with it + desert + a side.  It's a great value.  Well played Maggianos...well played.

First of all let me give kudos to the staff who helped us.  It's rare to find such great service nowadays so when I do I like to point out the places that do.  My girlfriend and I decided to eat more salad on our New Year's resolution quest.  She told me about Jason's Deli and how good of deal their salad bar is.  You can literally stuff as much salad in a containter which both people can share.   We did just that while adding toppings.   We had plenty for both of us and she still had some leftover for lunch.  Thanks for the great experience - we'll definitely be back.

This is a nice little neighborhood restaurant, good, but not great.  I've been here a couple times since I live close and have found the food to be well flavored, service quick, and drinks strong ;)  My personal recommendation is the penne alla campagna, a great mixture of pasta, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and chicken in an olive oil based sauce.  Not too heavy, not too light.  I was a little disappointed they only had peach sangria, a nice red one would have hit the spot.  They also have a gluten-free menu.  The staff is very attentive and take a lot of pride in their restaurant, but like a few other Yelpers have noticed, they seem to want to get you out quick.  Our server asked us twice if he wanted us to box up our dinner while we were clearly eating.  I don't want to be rushed on a nice dinner.  For a few more $ and because it's across the street, I have to recommend Rusconi's.  Their service and food is really 5-star.

I've been to this location for 2 years due to the proximity of it to me.  Trust me, if there was another gym nearby I would be there.  The equipment hasn't changed in two years.  I often see 'Out of Service' on many of the items.  Upstairs the cardio area definitely could use some extra ellipticals.  Amazingly they have not added any in 2 years!!  As one reviewer said at night there is usually a wait for them.    The worst though?  The service.  In two years I've been greeted about half the time.  This is a management issue.  I know it's reaaaaallly difficult to show your front staff how to say 'hello', but there are plenty of classes that can help you.  BTW, if you're a prospect, make sure to take a tour of the cardio area during times you'll be there so you get an idea if machines will be available.    All in all, the gym is old and most times they just don't care.

This place is low on customer service and high on frustration.  I agree with the other reviewers that the time it took to make an appointment is extremely frustrating.  I first opted to stay on hold for 6 minutes.  With no luck, I left a message.  When I missed the call I had to call back and go through the same thing.  The facility itself is dingy and dark.  I don't expect a resort setting when I go to a doctor's office, but it looks circa 1980.  The front-end staff acted like you were there to please them.  After I got to the waiting room I waited almost 45 minutes to see the doctor.  Really?    On a positive note, the staff checking the vitals, etc were very nice and friendly.  Dr. Hines seems like he sees many patients, I didn't get a very warm feeling from him.  Skip this center.

This was my first time here and probably my last.  I went with a very large meet-up group and service was paaaaaainfullly slow.  C'mon managers, when you have a large group, staff it appropriately!!   Drinks took forever to get there and getting the bill was just as painful.    BTW, you might ask your server what they do with your credit card once you give it to them.  Our server put ours in a huge batch with others in her pocket and then asked me to pick out which one was mine.  No ID check at all.  Really?      Too many other restaurants around here that have better service - pass.

What a disappointment.  I'm sure this restaurant has good food, it's why we came here. After 20 minutes though we left without even getting near the front of the line. This was avoidable, there was one person both serving and taking orders while another employee just sat there texting on his phone. Don't even think about going anytime after 12 unless you have 2 hours for lunch.

"Do no harm" is an oath medical personnel take, but it certainly doesn't apply to the care providers here.  Dr. Anne Marie Reed used to own an office that took their time and listened to you, but now they don't even care.    In January I went in to have them check out a mild inflammation in my ears and eyes.  The Nurse Practitioner prescribed Clobestasol Propionate.  I reviewed the side-effects online and found out it was an extremely strong corticosteroid.  Thinking it was more than what I needed, I contacted a dermatologist for a second opinion.  When I told him what I had it prescribed for he said he was shocked it would have ever been prescribed for my condition, and he certainly wouldn't have prescribed it himself.    The medication website clearly states, "should not be used on the face", which is one of the areas I advised the NP I was having inflammation.    I called the office and the Office Manager apologized, then advised she would give me an office credit of $50.  I thought this seemed reasonable as I had paid just over $50 for this medicine.    Amazingly a week later she stated she couldn't do this and felt the NP had prescribed the medicine properly.  I advised her I would be contacting the state medical board.  Like others who've complained, I received a nice form letter stating they would no longer be my Primary Care office.     I'm not suing or want anything, I wasn't harmed because I did my homework and didn't take the medicine they prescribed, but I want others to know about their horrible practice.    All they really care about is profit - not customer care.     I've filed a complaint with the AZ Medical Board.

This is such a gem in the NE part of Scottsdale.  There are many different types of hikes:  Some for beginners, and some that will challenge the hiking elite.    Some tips: The Gateway Loop will take you about 1.5 hours.  If you're in good shape you can run about 40% of it, get a great workout in, and finish in about an hour.  Pants fitting a little tight?  No worries:  Add Inspiration Point to your Gateway Loop hike.  It will almost double your time and you'll get a kick a$$ view from the top.  You can then either back track and rejoin the Gateway Loop or circle it around and add even more time to your hike.    You can't go wrong here - even the bathrooms are in 5-star hotel shape!  PS:  Saw a Tiger Rattlesnake on my last hike - yikes!

All I can say is...wow.  This is by far one of my best customer experiences ever.  I had planned on selling my car and wanted to see what they could offer.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted with a smile and handshake from the GM and then given a short informational on the process by a helpful representative.  After the short informational, the representative took my keys, gave it to an evaluator, and in less than 15 minutes I had an offer on my car (which was $1,800 higher than what a previous dealership offered).  Happy, happy, joy, joy!!  The good service didn't stop.  I was taken to the business office where the business personnel were friendly, informative, and just as helpful.  Because I didn't have a ride, the GM called a local car rental company for me so I could rent a vehicle (now being carless....).  Again, I can't say enough for this place, this is how service SHOULD be!!!  Thank you!!

Althought I just bought something small for my kitchen, their prices on furniture were very reasonable.  I liked that they had a good variety of contemporary stuff.  If you like Pier One, you'll probably like this place, except you won't pay the Pier One prices.    The staff were extremely nice and helpful.    Will be back again when I need more furniture.

This AT&T has moved to the SE corner of Tatum/Cactus.  I wanted to give a shout to Janae, who was professional, incredibly helpful, and funny!  She helped me transfer over data to a new phone.  Could I switch carriers?  Yes, but the service I received gives me reason to stay.  She made my experience very positive, this is what service should be.  Thank you again Janae!

I went there recently for an event that had over 130 people.  The event leader said she had told the owner far in advance of the event and of the amount of people.    The service was predictably slow, but I mean reaaaaaallllllyyyyyy slow.  They only had 2 servers, yes 2.  We had to get up and get the server, get our own water and drinks at the bar they were so overwhelmed.  This is OK at an Arbys, but not at a restaurant.    My rating isn't for the servers, they did their best to keep up, my rating is for the owner who really didn't care.

It took multiple visits to get a refund for double billing me. I then had to write the Better Business Bureau to get a refund for a separate rebate check. Instead of apologizing, they sent a nasty return letter stating they had already told me about the refund (they hadn't) and I was lucky to get my refund. They are truly the Kmart of Tanning Salons. Prepare to fight them for a long time if you have a problem and check your bank statements for double billing!!

I'm really not sure if I got the run around or not, but I called this company today about some door dings I wanted to get fixed and painted.  I guess they don't fix dings even though on their site it says, "Paintless dent repair (PDR) includes removing hail damage, fixing dents, dings, and buckles."   I guess lesson learned is don't call these guys if you have door dings even though they advertise it on their site.

Would you imagine a great restaurant could sit in a strip mall next to a pizza joint and a chain greek restaurant?  Believe it!    Rusconi's is a true gem. I had the sirloin tips while my girlfriend had the salmon.  Now these aren't your ordinary dishes: for example, my sirloin tips sat on a delicious bed of truffle scented mac and cheese.    I also liked that they don't serve over-sized huge portions.  The portions are just big enough so you have room for...wait for it.....the chocolate bread pudding.   The service was also excellent.  Our waiter was very funny, offered great suggestions, and always on point to fill our water and wine glasses.  We'll be back - but please don't sell out of the chocolate bread pudding.  I need more!!

I used the company on July 3.  The guys that actually moved me were very nice and helpful.  I had multiple broken items that I emailed them and they negotiated a settlement.  I can't say enough about the great service they provided after the check they sent was stolen.  The owner takes a lot of pride in customer service and it shows.  Wish all companies had this great of service!

I purchased a Groupon with high hopes of getting my golf game back in shape.  Unfortunately, this person doesn't believe in customer service.  After calling 3 times I received 0 replies.  He's probably a good instructor, but horrible at customer service.  Skip this groupon, it's not worth your time.

I placed a couple to go orders and found out that they had a new special price on their free crab puffs.   Instead of being $15 as advertised on their old menu, it's now $20 on their new menu.  The manager was extremely cool and still offered the $15 price since it appeared on their online menu.     Happy customer, happy tummies.  Next time I want to dine in.  LIke others have said, the ambiance is kind of retro California surf.  Great vibe.  Keep up the great work!

This is my neighborhood 'I just worked 10 hours and need pizza fast'  go to place.  The other kicker?  This is the best service you'll ever get at a pizza place.    Eats:  My Pie has done an excellent job taking the pan pizza and giving it a new look.  There are several suggested pizzas they'll make for you (try the Spicy Butcher for a little kick or My Uncle Nicky to satisfy your meatball craving) or you can just make your own.    The best part?  After ordering your pizza will be done before you can return a text, it's literally 2 minutes, yes 2 minutes.  Yowza!   They also have a nice selection of local craft brews, not a ton, but a good offering.  Recommendation: Sign up for their text marketing list (you do this at checkout).  I receive periodic texts for $2 off a pie.

Topgolf is really what bowling wants to be - fun without having to rent tacky shoes.    Even though it was incredibly fun, the reason I give it 5 stars though is the obvious effort to offer great service.    We went on a Friday and had no problem getting a bay. We were met outside by some nice Topgolf employees.  Once inside, employees quickly checked us in and escorted our group to our bay.  For an hour it averages about $11 person.  Food and drink prices I thought were reasonable.      I also want to give huge kudos to our server - she checked back frequently and was super friendly.  Recommendations:  Get your $5 membership online.  This will save you a little time inside.  Leave your sticks unless you're so tall or short that average size clubs won't do it for you. Our group of 4 did fine with the selection of clubs they had at the bay.        'Sunday Funday' offers significant discounts.     We'll be back - What a great place!

This was my second time here and the service was just as fantastic as the first time.  However, there were a couple things that were off.  First, they were out of the medium salsa which is odd, our server said it was because they had gotten slammed the night before.   Don't you make it everyday?   Next, the pork in the street tacos was a little dry. In fact, I had to remove a couple pieces that were grisly hard.  I did give a bonus star for great service which was greatly appreciated.

Lobster tacos and spicy shrimp.....Oh Bonefish how I'd love to give you more stars....but I can't.    We came in for a late happy hour and the placed looked great.  We had read good things about the bang-bang shrimp so we both ordered some.  Yum....the shrimp is worthy of the positive reviews and they have it for $6 on Wednesdays.    Unfortunately, the rest of the tale is not a good one.  Service was slooooooow, even with just 8 people at the bar and 2 bartenders.  They weren't bad, just not in a hurry to help anyone.    The lobster street tacos had 2 pieces of small lobster in them, some lettuce, and a light mayo.  The taste was uninspiring at best.  I would have recommended some chipotle mayo or something to spice them up.   I was charged for two lobster tacos and received just one.    Overall too many good restaurants in the Tatum corridor to return to this one.

Listen people, this is by far the best comedy experience and comedy value in the Valley.  Stand-up Scottsdale is located in Papi Chulos, who I can testify makes one solid mojito and has fantastic service to boot.  I'm also impressed by their salsa, they bring one spicy mix and one tame one for us gringos.  Now before you question what type of comedy club atmosphere are you going to get being joined on to a Mexican restaurant, have no fear.  The club is separate and well-designed.  Now here's the value: at least right now you receive 15% off your bill at Papi Chulos if you also have a Comedy Club ticket.  Now here's the double-bonus:  You can also get a Groupon for the show for $9.  Triple-bonus?  Yes!  They only have a one-drink limit.  Btw, the owner, Howard, cares about service: In-between comedians (who were top notch), he asked if anyone was having any service issues.  Wow!  Bottom-line:  Go!
