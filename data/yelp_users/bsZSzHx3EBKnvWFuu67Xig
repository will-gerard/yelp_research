Small, locally owned businesses hold a special place in my heart and are always on the top of my list to support. Azteca has been around for as long as I remember. I bought my prom dress here in 2005, my son rented his tuxedo here for a family wedding and naturally it was my go to when planning my own wedding.  The customer service is non-existent, don't expect to be greeted. They lack organization and have terrible communication. I would save yourself a headache and go elsewhere.   I gave two stars because they have a pretty large selection and refunded our rush fee as we received the dresses after the date they were promised to us. I am getting married out of the country and everyone has flights a week before the wedding. One of the workers and my bridesmaids were less than friendly with each other over the phone. The owner called me and kept me on the phone for 30 minutes proving her point (the dress delay, my bridesmaid and her workers, etc.) She again had to prove her point to my bridesmaid when she picked up her dress. I don't care what happened we just needed the dresses at this point. I appreciate the attempt to rectify  the situation with the reversal of the rush fee but I am done supporting this business.

We came here for the first time for our 1st Wedding Anniversary dinner and I wish we hadn't. I chose the place for the view, which is beautiful. Our food was mediocre, I had the chicken and the risotto was a little hard and flavorless. From the time I made the reservation over the phone to the time I was seated I was asked about 4-5x whether we were celebrating and I told them our 1st wedding anniversary. I thought they would send a dessert or something, why else would they ask and keep asking? But nothing.  Our server was great and so was the lobster bisque, view, and tidbits of history on the wall.

This is our favorite go to on nights we don't have time to make dinner and refuse to eat fast food. It is always fresh and consistent. We frequent the 7th ave and McDowell location more than this one but the food tastes the same.   Our favorites:  Greek Salad Chicken Salad Sandwhich Steak Roll-ups Protein Plate  And for our son-Ck strip kids meal-baked ck strips, no breading and rice

My brother ordered a custom cake from this place for his girlfriend's birthday and it was awesome (I did not taste it but they did an excellent job asthetically).   I stopped in during their anniversary sale for 4 cupcakes for $4. I was looking to try the churro cupcake/scout a place for a baby shower cake but they didn't have churro available. We took home 8 cupcakes of various other flavors and I have to agree with the other reviews in saying they were dry. I don't know if its because they were dated or if they are just dry.   One highlight was the red velvet flavor was better than others I've had although Tammie Coe and my late great grandmother hold the trophy for best. Also worth noting the cashier/owner(?) was a little difficult to understand. I was asking about a cake for order and he was not very clear.   Their portfolio of work is amazing and you might want to order here for something complicated and one of a kind.

Delicious Vegan Desserts!  My husband and I have had multiple tSoynamis and pastry treats here. Our favorites are: the Dough Boy and the PB 'n' J but we have also tried the specials: Banana Cream and Strawberry something and they were so good. The place is small, there's a wait sometimes, and parking is tight but be patient. Your nami will be worth the wait!

I've never had something here I didn't like. My husband is very much NOT a vegetarian and he loves this place. Their mock meat is incredibly real tasting. His go to is the Big Wac. I usually opt for the Spicy Peanut Chicken Salad. We took a Cheese Burger and fries home for our 15 yr old son and he had no clue it was mock meat.  Staff is awesome and service is fast.

I originally came here for the phenomenal flow yoga, which was great. I decided to try the party on a bike class and it was hands down the best group exercise class I have ever been a part of. The music and lights are so fun and uplifting.   The front desk chicks were sweet and helpful and the instructor was welcoming.  I had a delicious $8 Thai salad from the seed cafe afterwards.

Small family owned and operated serving Mexican Sushi and tacos.  The place can get busy and usually has a small staff resulting in a wait. We usually call in for take-out to avoid the wait. We have had the sushi, Mar Y Tierra and the Kissi Rolls, Carne Asada plate, and Mexican hotdog. The Mar y Tierra roll and salsa bar are highlights.

Love the place and the flavors. But homegirl serving the ice cream was RUUUUDE! I asked to try a flavor and said"is this your most popular flavor" and she replied "we don't have a popular flavor!" My little brother even laughed in disbelief. She really did not want to be helping people or chatting. Hopefully she was just having a bad day and doesn't hate her job and treat everyone like that. Cashier was sweet and friendly. Ice cream was yum.

Sumits North Phoenix is hands down my favorite Yoga studio I have ever had the opportunity to practice at!   I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this gem. The studio is beautiful and well kept. The staff is welcoming and helpful, even greeting me by name since my second time in. They have truly created a feeling of community here.   Each instructor has something wonderful to offer. Ashley's pointers, Sara's fun upbeat class, and Tabitha's serene guidance are a few of my favorite things about this studio.   Whether you are new or an experienced yogi this is a perfect place to practice!   Oh...and there's a plethora of parking behind the building.

Kaira's charged me $250 less than a bridal boutique in Scottsdale wanted to charge me for my dress. They are flexible, caring, and stayed in communication with me when my dress was delayed due to a strike in CA. My alterations were a lot more than I had budgeted for ($530 for bra cup inserts, hem, taking in sides, adding bustles) but my dress was altered perfectly in 1 week! I couldn't be happier with my dress. Thank you Maria (seamstress) and staff. I will share photos after my wedding.

My cousin took my son here who loved it so much he kept begging us to take him back and boy are we glad we did.   The general area is a little shady and the building has seen way better days but the food is so good. We usually order the tacos which run about $2.00 each and are small. I can eat 3, my son can eat 6. My husband had the Mexican hot dog and swears that its the best one he has ever had in Phoenix.

I love everything about this place except the coffee.   The staff is awesome both friendly and helpful. I've had a few breakfast items and a scone and they were delicious. Like really really good. The interior is cute and welcoming and the drive through is convenient and fast.   I don't consider myself hard to please. In general I usually get either an iced Americano or a latte when I'm wanting something sweeter. I prefer small coffee shops like Copper Star, Lola, Lux, Urban Beans to places like Starbucks and Dutch Bros.I like lattes that are strong and delicious but not too sweet. At Smooth Brew I've orded the Americano (perfect), the Mocha en Fuego (I love spice and this was awesome but a tad too much cayenne had me choking at the office. I had trouble finishing it), the Horchata Latte (Amazing idea but something was way off, I threw it away), the Mocha (meh), and something they recommended to me maybe it was the Panda (way too sweet).    I will not give up on this place as its new and I figure working kinks out. Get a punch card. I just love places with a punch card!

I am so happy this new location opened closer to my home. The food is so fresh and delicious. I have loved everything I've tried. Their salads are a good size and you can add protein (steak, chicken, salmon, or tofu) for a few extra bucks. Their soups change daily and the 3 different ones I've had were unique and yummy. My husband always orders the forbidden rice bowl with steak and its great. The lemonade/tea and fresh baked goods are also noteworthy. They have a couple of local wines and beers on tap too.   Service is A+, decor is adorable, and seating is plentiful. The ONLY downfall is that for 2 of us we never get out of there spending less than $45-50.

We came here for brunch on Father's day with a group of 7 (5 adults, 2 teenagers) and left in a food coma. Service was awesome. I had the the crabcake benedict from the brunch menu and they were not stingy with the crab which is hard to come by.   Try the $6 hash brown! 3 of us shared it.

Awesome concept. Poor execution.   My husband and I make it a point to hit a speakeasy in cities we visit so I was thrilled to know my home town was opening one.   The place is distinguished by a red light-bulb in the alley (awesome). Cash only (no problem). The 6 option drink menu was written on the wall with 3 of the options crossed out (not so awesome). Prices were a little steep being there were only 3 drink options and seating was scarce.  We came opening weekend so I will definitely give the place another shot. Valley Bar is a nice alternative but not necessarily a speakeasy.

We came here to see live music from The Henry Co. on a Thursday. We shared the calamari and shrimp fritti, the House Pizza (has chilies, must try if you are a fan of spice!) and a Margherita Pizza.  Pros: Beautiful place, excellent food, live music although I don't know if this is reoccuring.   Cons: Parking sucks. We parked around the corner in a neighborhood. Service is all over the place. Friendly but discombobulated. Lipstick on the glass (stuff happens, no biggie), forgot an appetizer, and just seemed really confused.

An event I went to had some small offerings catered by Chestnut a while back and they were great. After looking online for where to get Mama's Cold Brew on a Sunday we made the trip to Chestnut and we won't be returning.   To start the line to order was out the door but only 5 tables or so were occupied. The cashier looked frustrated and another gentleman came and took over. The line was moving slowly but moving. We ordered 2 cold brew coffees, a scramble plate, a soup, and a cookie. We were informed by the gentleman that Mama's creamer is 1.50 extra each coffee (no problem), but cold brew coffee refills are free (great). He poured quite a bit of creamer in (a little much) but being we could get coffee refills I figured I would drink some down and make room for coffee.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but our food was underwhelming with the exception of the cookie. We sat on the patio and despite 3 bus boys running around tables were still dirty with dishes.   On our way out I walked up to the girl behind the bar but not the cashier and asked for a coffee refill.There was still a line and I was trying to avoid stepping back into it. We had barely drank any it was very sweet with the excess creamer. She said she was new and unsure. I told her what the cashier had told me and she complied. The cashier then stops her and tells her we have to be charged. My husband said "for what"? We walked to a different cashier so that he could charge us for...a splash of coffee? To which my husband said " I will pay you but please tell me what I am paying for." After an explanation we were allowed to leave.    Mama's Cold Brew was on sale for take home, I really wanted to buy some but did not due to line and just wanting to get the heck out of there.   1 star for the cookie, 1 because we didn't hate the place
