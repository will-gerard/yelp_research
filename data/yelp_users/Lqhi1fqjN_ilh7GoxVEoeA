Derek is amazing! Personable and hooked my roomate and I up on appetizers and drinks! We asked his suggestions on things and he was more than willing to offer up his suggestion and a sample when possible. Wish we had spent all day here rather than spreading our hard earned dollars all around town.

amazing!!!!! cool atmosphere, great food (we had the monster burgers and children of the corn) and the most amazing service we have had in quite some time. Obviously it was our first time because we were oogling over the decor, so our server offered to show us around and told us some cool info/background on the restaurant. Top Notch service, he even brought us cups of h20 to go after we declined ordering a 2nd beer because we were driving. Extremely attentive. The only suggestion I would have made would be to keep the haunted house open the weekend after halloween (we really wanted to see it) and to lose the football on the tvs. horror films without too much gore would have fit the atmosphere so much better. We cant wait to bring friends back to Monsterland! its only a matter of time before some television show features this restaurant, its that awesome!

I am writing to let you know about my experience at the tempe marketplace Verizon wireless store on Rio Salado Drive in Tempe, AZ. I had walked in with my fiance to get a new battery for my phone. We were greeted promptly and helped by a associate named Charlie. He went into the back to get the battery i had requested when he came out with the battery he (as well as pretty much the entire store) noticed a Giant dust storm moving in. He showed me the battery then walked past me to the window. I said that I wanted to purchase the battery and he (apparently excited about the impending storm) ran around in a circle towards the back.  I called out id like to get home before the storm to which he replied "good luck" and went into the back to get his phone. He returns and goes outside to take pictures, brushing past us again telling us to "hang on". At this point we left without ever purchasing the battery.

This place has gotten much better since they have been open awhile. Today was my 4th time dining there and it was by far the best experience I have had there. The food, drinks, service and overall experience was much better than on my previous visits.  The patio was wonderful with each table having their own umbrella to provide shade. Also, they have happy hour 7 days a week which is a rarity for old town.
