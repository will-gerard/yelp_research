First off, if you're interested in fitness, real, honest to god get-in-shape, look good naked, fitness, this place is not for you. If you are looking to markedly improve your cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, coordination, agility, balance, *and* accuracy, this place is not for you.  Their free weights are stuffed in what some other fitness clubs would consider a closet. If you know what a clean and jerk is, and you go to this club, you're in The Village's 1%. Even the pool was a disappointment. It's not for laps, it's for moms to sun and read magazines while their kids splash and fart.  Don't get me wrong. You *can* get into shape here. But you *can* get into shape in your backyard. The cost of joining up could buy you a great set of Olympic weights, a pull up bar, new shoes, a weight vest, a kettle bell or two, a jump rope... But you wouldn't be considering a club if you wanted to get fit in your backyard and buy all your own equipment.  Now, if you're into tennis, this place will accommodate. I think half it's footprint is set aside for courts.  If you're into pretty girls in full makeup wearing their brand new Lulu Lemon Yoga Pants (and believe me, it's ALMOST worth joining for this particular scenery), there's plenty of that. If you're into orange dudes who won't sweat because it'll muss their hair and they simply spend toooo much on product to deal with that, then this place is for you. If you dig stepping on french fries the aforementioned farty kids dropped on the floor while chasing each other and screaming while wearing a full set of Under Armor compression gear that costs an average person's car payment, you'll dig this joint. If you're into a place to pretend you're into fitness and "be seen" then you should join up tomorrow. If you want to the cashier at AJ's to notice your latte cup with "The Village" emblazoned across the front while you buy your parakeet four cases of Fiji water to bathe in, then this place is for you.     There are some people here who are in great shape. There are some people who are flat out awesome to chat with. The customer service is nice. I would club baby seals for some of the girls here to star opposite me in a romantic comedy.       However, all of the positive aspects of this place are not involved with fitness. They're recreational, hang out, be part of a scene type of pluses. If you're willing to pay for that, then saddle up partner. But if you want to be taken seriously when you say you "work out", by people who actually do, then you don't work out at The Village.

A friend of mine found a stray last night that was the most matted, stinky, sad little pup I've ever seen. These folks took him, cleaned him, charged a 1/5th of what you'd expect (seriously it was like buttons and clamshells), and he looks great!   They've got my business.

Tuck is the best thing you can ask for in a neighborhood restaurant.   They value the local clientele with a genuine wink and nod, maybe a handshake or a "how's yer mom?" kind of comfortably friendliness. But, if you're not from the neighborhood it's ok! You'll be treated like part of the family anyways.  The head of the house, John, is one of the easiest people to talk with I've ever met. My second visit was a month away from the first and there was not only a "hey welcome back!" but a few inquiries about a conversation from my first visit. Visits 3-6 were even better. His balance of friendly and professional is top of the charts. I pride myself on being easily social but this guy can talk to *anybody*.   Don't be afraid to sit at the bar, either. It's small and quaint and handled perfectly. I could swim in their gin and tonics. In fact, I think I have, it's kinda fuzzy.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, and I eat out a lot. It's also one of the smallest restaurants in Phoenix so take that into consideration. Friday night at 7 isn't the time to walk in and expect a table for five. However, I would wait longer here for the experience than I would for a Bianco pizza or a plate of Matt's Big Anything (both of which I'm willing to hang quite a while for!).

I've never had a bad time at Hula.  The drinks are some of the best mixes in the valley. Be careful though, they pack a helluva punch.   From the burgers to the Mongolian beef bowl to their ceviche, you can't pick a bad dish.   They set out to be a throwback 50's style tiki bar and they nail it.   But, if you really want to enjoy yourself, sit at the bar. John (the tall guy) is hands down one of the best bartenders in the valley. Somewhere the art of that job got lost. The fun, easy to talk to, quick witted bartenders have been in large part replaced with a surly, too busy to chat, cooler than you crowd that makes it hard to be a repeat customer anymore. Not at Hula.   Some people think that five stars are too commonly given out. I think five stars are deserved when it's a place you've recommended *first* when somebody asks you where to go downtown. Hula's been that more than once.

I'm glad TMI exists. I live in Coronado and I love that I can just walk or bike over, have a few beers, relax, and hang out. The place has plenty of pros and only a few cons, unfortunately the cons have kept me away more than once.   Luckily for Matt and Co. the pros, in my opinion, definitely outweigh the negatives and I'll continue to be a regular.  This is a business that the neighborhood is better with.   The Good  - One of the best happy hours in town for beer lovers. $2.50 pints of Rogue? Yes, please. All day Monday? Seriously? And now it's one of the only places in downtown open on Sunday. (though I hear it's cramped some of the crews sunday night hijinx, I appreciate it)  - A small, broad based selection of excellent beers. You'll find the real deal in their taps, not just stuff picked up in closeouts.   - Good music. It's not the typical bar scene sounds. From Mos Def to The Pharcyde, it works. Even if you're not into the genre you'll probably still appreciate it.   - Dog friendly patio! I actually got trash talked once for *not* having brought my dog.   - Great patio, cosy small bar, nice use of inside space to accommodate various sized parties of people.    -If you bring a book and post up on the couch or at the bar, they're not dicks about turning over that seat.   - The regulars are pretty cool. While this spot could easily get that coffee house vibe of noses up and glasses down, it doesn't.    The Bad  - Go often enough and you're going to get tired of the food. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I would slay baby seals for some SPECIALS! Get something seasonal going on! This is the entire reason for me writing this review. If the food changed up on a more regular basis or if there were specials weekly/biweekly then I would eat here waay more often.   - Did I mention I wished the food changed up more often? The kitchen doesn't have room for a fryer. If only somebody would start some kind of business that would do something like..I dunno, knock down walls and rebuild them in other spots?   - Some of the taps just refuse to go away. I'm sure the Inebriator Stout is popular, but after the Sonora/Sonoran split I just won't put it in my mouth. Yes, I said it.    It's a great spot and I dig it.

I checked this place out on a two month whim. I'm glad I finally did.  As a member of the 24 Hour Fitness on 32nd and Camleback, this is like working out in the future.    While the few people I've seen here aren't what I would call friendly, I've yet to see the place packed. Every membership comes with towel service.   The locker room is clean. The showers almost make you feel silly for bringing flip flops. I think one of the soaps had aloe in it.  The worst thing I've noticed is after rush hour there can be some towels piled up and maybe an empty protein shake can left in a locker.   I toured The Village and just couldn't bring myself to join. I mean, a gym that has a bar in it? Seriously? Kids eating french fries on the carpet outside the weight room? Really?   While it would be nice for Golds to have some courts or a pool or something, honestly, I'm ok with it not. It's Gold's. They're kind of known for getting your ass in shape not being a place soccer moms can barter for carpools over a latte.   Don't get the wrong idea though. The place isn't for the hardcore, barbell dropping, chalk on the palms, vein faced sweat spitters that populate some of the traditional Golds. This is both a plus *and* a minus for this place. If you want to do some serious weight training then expect to use machines. While they do have a decent free weight area it's just too small. Two Smith machines are ok, but only one real squat rack? C'mon. If you want to work on Oly lifts like a snatch then you're going to either have to wait your turn or improvise with dumbells.    The trainer staff is nice enough but aren't really cued into the basic gym etiquette. For example, one day I was doing overhead squats, so I had over a hundred pounds suspended over my head, and one of the trainers walks *directly* behind me, between myself and a bench rack. Not that big of a deal in writing, but she and her trainee were potentially within inches of having their heads crushed if I couldn't hold my grip.  Kind of amateur.    As with any gym there's the douche canoes and their spiked hair, there's guys dropping the occasional set of dumbbells and two uptight guys on elliptical trainers who will glance at each other and do a synchronous eye roll over it. Sometimes the trainers take up too much room with a client, but all in all if you avoid rush hour it's a good spot. Oh, but the music sucks, bad.

It's like Buffalo Wild Wings minus the wings. Well, yeah, and more beer. Barely.    At 4pm on a Thursday three friends and I found an empty table (shocking in a place that likely seats fewer people than The Grind).   After roughly ten minutes at the table one of my friends finally got up and asked a waitress for menus. As there were probably 25 people working, it wasn't hard to find somebody to ask. Strange since not one of them had been over to us yet.  She wasn't given a bottle list, which apparently is a claim to fame for them, but we got to look over their taps and a list of local eateries that are willing to deliver.  Hmm, no thanks on that idea.  The taps were a disappointment. A large variety of over priced local offerings, some mediocre imports (Colorado and Oregon make great beer but having Dead Guy on your tap isn't risque). Not even a single sour.   At this point we were getting pretty thirsty. A timer was set for 15 minutes. If a server didn't ask us for an order we were outta here.  The server did finally show up. She talked to the other party taking up the rest of the room. I leaned into my group and told them that watch, this girl wasn't going to even *allow* us to make eye contact. She was going to get their bill straight, ignore us, and split.   Exactly what happened. She literally kept her back to us the *entire* time she was in the room.     On the way out I asked a server if the room we were sitting in offered wait service, or if the customers were expected to walk to the bar to order a beer. Again, without eye contact, she said yeah the room has service, and then turned her back to me and stared at her notepad.    This isn't their first location. A company with as many outlets as these guys have should open with servers who know how to carry one-single-product from point A to point B.   Rude servers. Maybe not all of them, but I wouldn't know. After the three I dealt with here I won't ever deal with a fourth.  Lackluster tap list. If you want good taps go to Taste of Tops or Brat House, or a smaller spot like TMI.   No food. Having deliveries doesn't count.   Big Business Chain. While the owners want you to think its an edgy, tattoo'd and hip local spot for cool kids, it's not.
