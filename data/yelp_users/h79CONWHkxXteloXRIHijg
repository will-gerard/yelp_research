Pros: great chips and salsa! Veggie tacos were very tasty. Ambience on outdoor patio is great. Cons: the service. I think our server was just too busy with three other relatively big tables . She took our order, delivered the first round of drinks, and then never saw her again. Not until we were almost finished with our meal. I was able to flag down the hostess for the waters and more chips and salsa. She was helpful and asked if she could get us anything else. We also had to see the hostess for our bill.  The pork carnitas taco was really dry and the bison taco was average at best.   Just too many other good places in the area to eat.

Used previous yelp reviews to find this place just off the 10 on drive back to Tucson from Phoenix. We wanted some brunch stuff to go.  This place is great!!! Great food with wonderful customer service. Tuna melt, a BLT with added roasted turkey on top, and the crepes were all nice and flavorful. Good quantity.  More people should know about this place. Looking forward to stopping in again when back in town  Thanks!!!!
