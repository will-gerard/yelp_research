This place is great. The food is made fresh, very friendly staff, and great pricing! It's always busy here so prepare to wait in line. It's worth the wait. Enjoy and help support a local business!!!

We had a great experience! Such down to earth people who care about good food and service. I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak with a cup of creamy asparagus soup! Thank you Kristen for the great service!!!

Ashley made our first visit a great one! If course the great food helped out quite a bit. The local greens salad A+, sweet & spicy burger cooked to perfection, a little too big for my liking, but I are it all. Such a great local bar feel!!! I'll be back.

Not the best. Quality of the food has gone down hill. We were the only table there and service was very slow. The gazpacho is like a cold tomato bisque, don't order.

From drinks to entree you cannot go wrong. This place is a great addition to the Biltmore area. Olive to start, who ever thought they'd be so good. Warm would even be better! Burrata with fresh greens and tomatoes, a great next course. Pepper shrimp, delicious and cooked perfectly and for dinner, the most amazing scallops!!! And I'm a New Englander!!! So, the food is amazing! Next you have to ask for Tim the server, great in every step if the way! Nick the manager stopped by, talked with us like we have known him for years!! I love the Gladly. Not to mention, this is only our second of many visits to come! You're fools for not dining here. Enjoy!!

I've been here a few times and it's been okay. Today we walked in and sat at the bar and waiting a good 12 minutes for a bartender to arrive. During those twelve minutes, a gentleman is sitting at the bar finishing his meal. He then proceeds to get up and walk into the kitchen. This gentleman, was the manager and watched us sit there and wait for service. There was absolutely no sense of urgency to take care of guests. It was really disappointing because we will only go to local establishments especially in the summer to support our local businesses. Sorry Grass Roots! Not a win!

Being a New Englander I may be a tougher vote than others. Service was poor, uneducated in wine and the menu. My friend and I had to explain to her the difference between a Connecticut lobster roll and a Maine lobster roll. She could not explain the wine list at all. Oysters were extremely small and dry, fish and chips were rubbery and tasteless, lobster pasta had potential but served with spiral pasta, which really cheapened this pricier dish. Lobster rolls, once we described them properly to our server, were tasty and true to tradition. The ambiance  has a "Scottsdale" trashy feel and many of the clientele were there to be seen and definitely heard. It has a bar feel with subpar food. I don't see this place lasting long on our very culinary driven Indian
