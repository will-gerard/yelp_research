While decently priced, this is somewhere to only come when drunk. The food lacks any real flavor and is greasy. You get a lot of meat for $5 tostada but it's not really someone I'd come back to unless I was hard up for money lol

Sooooo glad we found this place! Came to pick up my boyfriend's car from a tint place late Sunday night and saw this little taco truck. We looked it up on Yelp to see only four reviews but five stars. We were intrigued.   This spot is, dare I say it, adorable. There a tables, a DJ   playing music and a waitress. We tried all the tacos... And all the tacos are AMAZING. Don't be intimidated to come to this side of town... These tacos are worth the treck. They're serviced with some great salsa (just the right amount of heat) and some smooth avocado salsa.   They also have desserts! Flan cheesecake that my boyfriend loved (I can't eat dairy unfortunately) but that was the most I've seen him smile in a while.   I literally wish I could rate this place 10 stars. We will definitely be back! It's no mystery why this place has been around for over 15 years!

So bomb. No lengua-bummer! But the pastor is delicious! Veges weren't as good as last time, but the meat was great as always and so was that avocado sauce... Yum! Will definitely be back and I recommend it to ALL my Yelp friends!

Came here a few months back with my friend who recommended the filet mignon kebab... Definitely worth it!

For a 3 star motel, this is a good one. They've got free breakfast that they actually make in front of you, a happy hour with free drinks and snacks and they allow dogs. The rooms we've had were clean and spacious. Pillows are comfy... Bed is ok. Some of the staff are a little rude but nothing too bad. Downside: it's by Arizona Mills and you know what that means. Overall this is a great hotel for dirt cheap.  I previously rated this place 4 stars...that has now dropped to 2 because the lady at the breakfast place is a witch. The last time we stayed he there was a kid trying to get some cereal but she said the cereal dispenser was broken.  The Kid was really sad so someone in my party tipped the dispenser upside down so that it would get unclogged.  She flipped out and started yelling at him. And banging pots and pans and huffing and puffing and cursing in Spanish.  Today, we chose to stay here again and she tells this member of my party that he can't use the waffle maker or the cereal machine. What the hell kind of petty bull shit is that? We paid for our hotel just like everyone else and now you're on a power trip?  We will be going to management. Completely unprofessional and terrible customer service.

If I could somehow pour enough of the red curry to swim in it without being burned... I'd be the happiest girl in the world. This place is super affordable, super fast, friend and oh my God that red curry. I literally get the exact same thing every time I come (this is my 10th tkme) it's that good. Pad Thai is bomb as well. But seriously... Red curry.  :)

Awesome food! Been here twice and loved it both times! Get the Shwarma platter for two or four... Plenty of food... Even enough for leftovers. The Arabic tea is delicious!! Make sure to ask to add mint to it. Boyfriend loves the pita bread. I'm gluten free, but it smells amazing! Overall a great place and we will be back! Make sure to also come on a Friday or Saturday night for the belly dancing.

Super good Mediterranean at Tempe Market Place! We got the chicken Shwarma plate that was TONS of food and so flavorful! I've had much better hummus but the Shwarma was so tender and the rice was bursting with flavor! I'd definitely come back. Great bang for your buck!

Super clean El Pollo Loco location... Like crazy clean. Food was solid. Don't know what all the really bad reviews are four. It was one of the better El Pollo Locos in the valley.

Freaking amazing tacos!!! The beef was great, the avocado salsa was amazing and the corn tortillas were super fresh but the absolute best part was the lengua!!!  Let me tell you, this place does it RIGHT. Fall apart tender and bursting with flavor. I'll be back specifically for the lengua. It's worth the trip all the way down the 17 for me!

Super skimpy on portions at the end of the night... What are you saving it for at 9:54 pm?

Gluten free waffles at affordable prices in Vegas? What? And Nutella? Sign me up! Great coffee for an amazing price. Staff is friendly. This hole-in-the-wall coffee shop is definitely worth venturing off the strip to go try.

Good in an unlikely location. Thick and delicious corn tortillas... The Carne en salsa Roja is great and so is the beef barbacoa. Awesome salsa bar and flavorful beans. Friendly staff too. The red spicy salsa will make your mouth burn in a good way... But beware... They ain't lying on the spicy level. Decent prices and a wide selection of fresh foods. Good spot for anytime you're at the AZ state fairgrounds.

Not worth it in my opinion. Had the tossed Greek salad with roasted veges which were a joke. Veges weren't done at all and the onions tasted sour. Also big chunks of the outer peel. The salad was big and the chicken was fresh but there was WAYYY too much diced raw red onion. Like so much I stopped eating the salad. Would have given this place 1 star except for the portion size was good. Now after reading other reviews I just hope I don't get sick. Won't be back. There are so many better Mediterranean places. Should have gone with my gut.

First, I love the concept. Fresh, healthy food to go for the working man or woman or busy mom or dad. Prices are reasonable and there's a HUGE selection.  Not really a place I'd come and sit to eat since it's not really set up that way.  I ended up purchasing five items:  Pineapple Habanero Chicken Oh my gosh was this delightful! The right amount of spice and sweet. Amazing!   Spinach Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes Good but a little bland. Could have used more seasoning.   Chicken Salad Great fruit and texture but bland to my palate as well  Sweet Potato hash WAYYY too salty. So salty that I actually couldn't finish it. Good flavor, but needed to be dialed back several notches.   Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble Honestly, this review should be a 4. But this Crumble is one of the best damn things I've ever eaten plus it was gluten free. Worth the trip back for this $4 tin of heaven alone!

This place is truly a hidden gem. I have been craving Mediterranean food for so long and I'm so glad I came here for my fix! It's a little hole in the wall place in a strip mall but what it lacks in size it makes up for in flavor. I got the chicken Shwarma plate after asking the owner which was better... That or the gyros. He said the Shwarma. He wasn't lying. It was BURSTING with flavor. Some soft pieces, some crunchy. Amazinggg. Great garlic sauce and awesome, super creamy humus. The salad dressing was great too. Super good value for your money. The plate and a drink cost me about $11 and it was worth every penny! I'm stuffed and I normally don't ever feel full. He was a doll and even brought me out a baklava. I will DEFINITELY be back. I'm not a huge fan of Mesa... But I think Green Corner may have made me turn the corner about this city. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

Good value for what you pay for. It's not top of the line Mediterranean...meaning it's not authentic. Definitely americanized but it's super good. Best fast food-type Mediterranean. I like it a lot more than garbanzos. The cilantro jalape√±o hummus was flavorful and so was the chicken kebab. I love that they have fresh juices as well (and affordable compared to Nektar or Whole Foods). We had the Beach Bum which was kind of weird because of the cucumber but really good. Staff is super friendly and nice. We will definitely be back!
