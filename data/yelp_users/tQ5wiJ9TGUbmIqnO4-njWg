La Tolteca is one of those Mexican gems in Phoenix that I get worried about too many Gringos (hey, I know I am one of them) finding out about.  Cheap, tasty. It is a seat-yourself eatery and small market combined with a bakery. I like that they have a decent selection of baked goods, but there are a few local panaderias that do it a bit better. HOWEVER, their salsa bar is top notch and their food is delicious. I personally love La Tolteca because it is one of the only places in the valley that regularly has green corn tamales available. The staff is always very pleasant, and the food is always good.  This place does get pretty hectic at meal times and on weekends, but the seating area is rather large. Sometimes the service gets a bit backed up, but honestly, it just adds to the lively feel of the place.

Although it leans on the pricey side of Phoenix cuisine, Houston's is by far one of my favorite places to go out for a nice dinner. Their veggie burger is beyond amazing (I always get the couscous on the side which is also delicious).  On a recent trip, my boyfriend ordered the ribs on a recommendation. He said they were by far the best ribs he has ever enjoyed.

I love their tortillas and their salsa. Their salsa has a strong garlic flavor and is unlike any other mex joint I have encountered in AZ. Carolina's has a very extensive and cheap menu; two people can easily eat for under $10.   Watch out! Carolina's gets CRAZY during peak eatin' hours from its downtown cult following.

I don't know why it took me so long to try Lalibela. Tucked away in a typical tempe strip mall, Lalibela had a decent crowd for 8:00 on a weeknight. And we found out why - the food here is superb.   I ordered the vegetable combination and my parner-in-crime ordered the meat combination. His prefered the two beef dishes to the chicken. They are very generous with the inerja here.  I LOVED the Tikil Gomen (cabbage) and the Gomen (collard greens), but all four of the dishes were wonderful. I also enjoyed the Misir Wat (lentils); my boyfriend said that the lentils were his favorite vegetarian item when he sampled all of my items. The Fosolia (string beans) was good, but I prefered the other items.  Order their iced teas! We had the Tossign which was very refreshing and the Yekemem Shai - which is very similar to a Chai.

One of my favorite spots in all of AZ.   Green proves that vegetarian, and more importantly, VEGAN food can be interesting and delicious. More importantly, the dishes served here can fullfill your junk-food cravings.  I am a vegetarian, but not usually a fan of mock meat products. Green does such a great job at creating tasty vegan creations that the mixed crowd will amaze you. Not to stereotype the vegan "look", but if you come in to Green during the very busy lunch rush, I would bet money that 50% of the patrons are regular meat-eaters. The food is just THAT good!  I have tried most everything on the menu, and my personal favorites are:  spicy buffalo "wings" jerk tofu salad mexicali burger thai peanut bowl with crispy tofu original "g" spicy po-boy sammy  One more thing:  They always have delicious daily specials and homemade desserts.

This is hands-down still my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area.   All I need to say is "I love curry", and they by far have the best green curry in town.   The food is consistently amazing and the portions are very generous (I usually get a second meal out of my entree leftovers), and I have never been disappointed

They took me on a walk in. Great pricing, super friendly staff, and my girl did a nice job. Got a fill and gel polish with hearts for valentines day for $33. Can't complain about that!

The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.  I still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.

I am VERY disappointed with my experience here. I had bought a couple of groupons when they were available ($10 for $20) because I was excited about a local alternative to Sprinkles (which in my opinion, does not live up to all the hype).  Decided to use one of the groupons to get some cake pops for my team of co-workers for valentines day. Expecting today to be chaos, I stopped in yesterday to purchase them. Before I made my purchase, the woman behind the counter said that I should come back tomorrow as they would have some special pops for valentines day. So I did....  I waited in line for 20 minutes upon their opening, only to have the woman behind the counter tell me that they did not have the pops available for regular purchase by the dozen. My only option was to buy them in boxed sets of 4 (very pretty gift items, but defeating for my purpose) for $19.99. After some protest, she said that I could buy a dozen pops, but they only had the custom ones available and they would be about $10 more for the dozen. I told her that it was my intent to use the groupon to cover the majority of the cost, so I wanted the standard pops. She finally agreed and I walked away with 6 white cake and 6 chocolate cake pops. PS, When you look at the menu, there are * flavors listed as "House flavors" and I went in with the intention of getting a variety. She told me that the only house flavors were plain chocolate and plain vanilla and any other flavor would be an additional charge.  My biggest problem is that I wanted to inform a manager/owner about the situation. I feel that as a customer, I was given incorrect information that inconvenienced me and I wanted to let him/her know. I was directed to the individual at the register who disregarded my experience completely and was quite rude.   Please fix your menu so the pricing makes sense and try to give more accurate information to customers, especially if they are making more than one trip to your store based on what you tell them.

So, let me begin this review by stating that until 4 months ago and my discovery of the gel manicure (Gelish, OPI Axiom, and Shelac), I REFUSED to pay another human being to paint my nails.  1. Best case scenario is the manicure lasts through the first day instead of just on your awkward spread-fingered trip to the car 2. I can do the same chip-two-hours-later paint job myself  Then I was introduced to the world of gel....I am obsessed. I have been trying various nail salons that offer gel services, and Polished Nail Spa is by far by favorite. I admit that the industry-wide price tag for gel services is on the high side (around $100 for a mani/pedi combo). The different brands claim to last 14 to 21 days, but I easily go a month between appointments.  Ok, on to Polished....  The salon is fairly small with two mani stations and two pedi stations, and a great, earthy decor that makes you feel very comfortable   Michelle is a doll. It is alawys nice when you are patronizing a business and actually get to intereact with the owner. She is down-to-earth, bubbly, and the conversations with her flow easily. More importantly, she had extensive product knowledge about the equipment in the salon and the products they use. She was also very helpful at suggesting layering combinations and colors that would flatter your skin tone.  Bottom line: this place is fairly tiny and from what I understand, only has three nail techs including the owner, but I doubt they will stay that way once the word gets out.

Ok, coffee plus mexican coke? The royal soda is pretty much the perfect mix of magic. Coffee lovers must try this unique beverage!

Thanks to you, Capriotti's, my boyfriend and I can finally go out for sub sandwiches together.  My boyfriend has been a regular at Capriotti's (both here and Vegas) for years. As a vegetarian, I have a pretty strict "no sandwich chains" dining rule. I do not want sliced tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, and mustard on bread for a meal. On his last Capriotti's visit, my boyfriend informed me of the vegetarian-friendly menu. I looked it up online, couldn't wait to try it.  Inside, the Tempe location is more of a cute deli than a subway. The staff was very nice and helpful and the sandwiches were served quickly (the establishment was not busy at the time though). My boyfriend got the turkey sub (his usual) and I got the vegetarian version. On my sub, I got faux turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion (which are so thinly sliced and amazing), pickles, sweet peppers (also amazing) and mustard. I would recommend this combination to any vegetarian looking for a filling and tasty cold sub sandwich.  I noticed some people on here complaining about the pricing. Well, the ingredients here are of a much higher quality and fresher than a subway or quizno's, so in my opinion, it is worth paying a couple extra dollars. My boyfriend loves it because they use shredded turkey instead of deli slices on the subs. I am not sure if I will be able to wait many meals before running over there to try the vegetarian version of the Bobby.

This place is adorable. My man and I went inside just to check it out when we were strolling by on Mill Avenue. We LOVE paletas, and it was so strange to see a small shop dedicated to them. The place is clean, simple, and reminiscent of a pinkberry or similar yogurt shop.  Unlike a pinkberry, the name behind the brand, Betty, is also the face behind the counter. She is very passionate about what she prepares and explained that she only uses the freshest of ingredients (she even said that the mango chile paletas are not currently available because the mangos are still ripening). I got the fresa con creme - strawberries n cream (I love the creamy ones), and my boyfriend got amanecer - pineapple with raspberry. Both were excellent. It took every ounce of will power not to get seconds.  If you compare the price to what you would spend at a Mexican market, they are expensive. But I would much rather spend $3 on a fresh, delicious fruit bar than on a single scoop at baskin robbins. I cant wait to try more flavors. Arroz con leche is up next.
