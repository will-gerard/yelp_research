Great place to grab a quick, cheap lunch in a laid back environment. The $5 Burger Box comes with three toppings (cheese, bacon, avocado, red onion, to name a few) and a side of fries. I like the sweet potato fries. The bar staff are friendly and attentive and I always here the most random statements from day drinking patrons.

Amazing food. One of my favorites in Tempe. So many options to choose from. I recently tried The Pilgrim. It's Thanksgiving dinner wrapped in warm pastry bread. Delicious!

I work on Mill Ave and wanted to try something new so I gave Corleone's a shot. A sign on the window advertised a Phili Combo for $5 or $6 available everyday however, when I asked the guy inside about a lunch combo he rudely informed me that they don't have one. I still gave it a chance and got the small Buffalo Chicken Phili. The sandwich was alright but not worth the $7.50 I payed for it. There wasn't much meat and the bread fell apart after the first bight. I definitely won't be back.

Chompie's is one of my favorite places to get breakfast. The Benedict's are excellent. The menu is enormous. I've been going here  for years and have just recently started trying lunch and dinner items. The turkey sliders with matzo ball soup is a great choice. And don't forget to try the desserts. Delicious.

Best place to get lunch on Mill Ave. When I worked in Tempe, I ate there 3 or 4 times a week. The daily special includes a sandwich, with your choice of salad, French fries or hummus and a drink for just $6.50 including tax.  And the owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.

They've shown some improvement. I ate at Bliss opening weekend and was not impressed. However, I gave it a second chance and had a much better experience. I had a grilled cheese sandwich with the creamy tomato soup. My boyfriend had the Bliss Burger. Both were great comfort food. We'll be back again.

Hands down my favorite place in Phoenix. I see movies there once or twice a week. The programming offers a wide variety of options. They play everything from current indie movies to documentaries to cult classics.   Catch a movie Monday-Wednesday and take advantage of the weekday special. You get a ticket to the movie, a popcorn and a beer or glass of wine for only $12.

Awesome flat bread pizza. I don't know what they make the crust out of but it's delicious. My favorite is The Super Greeky. To be honest, I haven't tried the others yet because it's so good. Don't pass this food truck by if you see it.
