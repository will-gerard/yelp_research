Consistency.  That's what I love most about Honey Bears.  I'll disagree that "you don't need no teeth", but I will say that the chicken is juicy, the beans are incredible, and the hot sausage is amazing. Your sweet heat vinegar bbq sauce is delicious. Your service is fast, and you serve some off-brand sodas on tap, which makes me smile everytime.  But every time I have had a meal here, it has been tasty. Have I had better BBQ? Yes. However, your location and consistent experiences have kept me a fan.   Smoke your ribs longer, please.

McAlpines is one of those old school places that would probably be right at home in downtown Prescott. Authentic, amazing service, and the whole fact that they have an antique store really helped make this place shine.   We had a simple dessert that consisted of 2 Phosphorus's and a hot fudge sundae, and after wards, I felt bloated and diabetic. That's because for the prices, you get a surprising amount of deliciousness. You feel like a little kid when your kind, humorous, tattooed server brings you a MASSIVE sundae cup, dripping with hot fudge and all of the toppings.   The only, and I mean, THE ONLY drawback, is that I live so far away from them. On the other side, I guess that means I won't be gaining 20 pounds anytime soon.

Seeing that this place has great reviews on Yelp, and with raving reviews from my co-workers, I decided to try out this place.  It's unfortunate that Schlotzkey's has the catchphrase "Strange name, serious sandwich", because Cheese N Stuff takes the cake.  I had the Manhattan, which was a take on the classic Ruben, and it was delicious!  The only thing though is that I would have loved my sandwihc on rye, not wheat.  This is the kind of place that just oozes good feelings, and the owner is more than helpful.   I enjoyed my sandwich, and intend on going back, especially because they carry Lutefisk.

I finally got to try the fabled Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe, and I will say that I am a fan now, but there were a few glaring inconsistencies that really keep this place from shining.   First off, the goods: Delicious beverages, and a menu that is completely out of this world. I can get clam linguine in a white wine sauce, along with spicy Korean bbq beef in soba noodles, which is exactly what we did one night.  The flavors were excellent, although a little muted, and the amount of clams were amazing. There was a little bit of sand in some of the clams, but to me, that shows the dedication to having a fresh piece of seafood on the plate.  I also thought that my wife's clams were swimming in the sauce, as there was a TON of it on her plate. Conversely, while my plate was cooked well, I felt that 1) the beef needed to be spicy, and 2) there needed to be more of it. I really felt like I was eating more noodle than anything else.   And that's what keeps this place from getting a 5. The little things, like a lack of spice, too much sauce, the absolutely dreadful & schizophrenic decor, and, well, on our night, the single server handling the entire restaurant.    There are some nice little touches though. They serve you some of the best banana bread that I have had in a long while, their green tea is tasty, and the menu selection is above and beyond what I was expecting. I'll come back, that's for sure, and you should definitely give this place a try.

I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet.   It's incredible, really. An incredible amount of pork products, from all natural casing hot dogs, to different wursts, to the most amazing sausages, and tons of products like capicolla, head cheese, bologna...it's all good.  This past weekend, I picked up the Hot Italians, Sweet Italians, Apple, Jalapeno Cheddar Dogs, Beer Hots, and their Cajun Boudins.   Obviously, I love my pork (urge to make sausage innuendo jokes rising...).   All of the sausages were amazing. Juicy, tender, with crisp skins. The hot italians were actually spicy, which is amazing, most "hot" italians aren't. The jalapeno cheddar dog was gooey and spicy, and the beer hots were spicy with just a hint of lager to them.  I've had the Cajun Boudins, but I haven't been able to get into my new ones, but to be honest, they're amazing. Mixing pork and rice in a sausage is an awesome idea.  In their store, they have samples. The head cheese is glorious, despite the name of "head cheese", trust me, it's incredible...   Very cheap prices and friendly staff (even though I would honestly expect a huge italian guy, yet I am greeted by two awesome women) help round it out, and keeps Schreiner's at the absolute top of my list.

Despite being a chain, The Capital Grille breaks the formula of "tired steakhouse", and led to one of my favorite dining experiences I've ever had, though I have a few reservations, but I'll get those in a moment.   First off, getting in was extremely easy, but it was a Monday night. Last minute anniversary idea totally worked in our favor, as we were greeted with a "Happy anniversary!", and led to a seemingly huge booth decorated with rose petals & cheap plastic heart pieces, which was a nice touch.   The drink selection consisted of standards like martini's and a massive wine list. We went for the basic. Dry gin martini, 3 olives. They pulled it off wonderfully, and it was shaken/poured tableside, as it should be.  We started with the calamari. They fry them up in a bready, salty batter. Almost too salty. Then, they do something awesome, and toss in chopped cherry peppers. The result is this concoction of spicy bready perfectly fried calamari. The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish, which is completely unexpected and delicious. Great ratio of head vs body too. I hate it when restaurants just give me heads. I'm not afraid of tentacles!   I had the sliced filet migon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms, finished with a 12 year balsamiq reduction. Perfect crust on the steak. The saltyness of the crust brought out the juices of the meat, when combined with the reduction, resulted in a fantastic melt-in-the mouth feel.  That being said, I wish it was a little more rare.  She had the special, which was a lamb roulade filled with an herb cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. While this proved to be a winning combination of flavors, the lamb was slightly overcooked from medium rare.   We got the lobster mac and cheese, which had huge chunks of lobster. The cheese was mascarpone, which resulted in a soupier mac, but it worked well with the lobster. We also got the french green beans with heirloom tomatoes, which while tasty, wasn't anything special.   For dessert, we were brought an espresso chocolate flourless cake, finished with raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries. Rich and delicious.  In the end, it was a fantastic meal. The Capital Grille is not the best steakhouse I've ever been to though, it is a very close second. I recommend in a heartbeat.  As a p.s: The service was top notch. I even got a phone call the next day, wanting to know how the experience was. I have never gotten that kind of attention from a restaurant before, and I doubt it will happen again.

First off, like what Daren below me wrote, there are 2 Casey Jones's. One offers up free UFC, and this one offers up an incredible local beer selection , and some decent food to go along with it.   It's a sports bar, and it does it well. And they carry everything, including stuffed pizza sticks, nachos, and my personal favorite, fried cheese curds.  Yes, fried cheese curds. Balls of wonder.   Go for the beer, the tv's, and trivia on Thursdays.   Parking is horrific.

It's hard to find good sushi in Phoenix, especially when most sushi is found in Scottsdale, and usually populated by the snobby and uninspired eaters.  Fresh Wasabi is not for them.  This is a place for the real sushi eater, who is not afraid to try extreme flavors and very fresh fish. They have an incredible menu, filled with traditional sushi/sashimi, and with your more contemporary rolls, including the old standbys like Alaskan rolls, spicy tuna, Dragon, etc.  When I went, I got to have one of their Sashimi plates, which included very fresh tuna, salmon, incredible octopus, some of the best Mackerel I've ever had, and a small tuna/octopus salad that was amazing.   I also had the Uni, which is my absolute guilty pleasure. It was oceanic, soft, and intense, the nori was a little chewy though.   The scallops dynamite was very good, but it could have been slightly spicier, I enjoy the spicy a little more than most people do, but the scallops were sweet and mixed well with the kewpie and fish eggs.   We finished up with a roll ( the name escapes me), topped with salmon and eel sauce, filled with a spicy tuna mixture, it was good, but nothing too special.  On this special occasion, we had desert. Green Tea Ice Cream was soft and chilled, with frost on it, quite nice, and tempura battered cheesecake was incredible.    Also, the staff is very awesome, but that might be because we went with a regular, I'd love to go back and sit at the bar though.  I highly recommend Fresh Wasabi if you're on the west side, despite the weird location next to a Fry's.

Greek wraps is one of the tastiest places I have ever been to. Their gyro is superb, and their falafel is one of the best. If you go, definitely get the "Wrap" vs the Pita. The wrap is freshly made, and it really adds to the meal.  The rice is incredible, the dolmas are ok, they might be pre-packaged, but my Fiance and I have been going there since they opened, and we've loved it. The owners are very nice, and yeah, sometimes it does take a little bit of time to get the food, but really, should you be in a rush to wolf food down your throat? If you want that, theres a Burger Slop down the road.

Halo is amazing. I have been to plenty of piercing parlors, and none has ever matched Halo, in terms of selection, intelligence, or cleanliness. God the cleanliness. I have been going to them exclusively since I got my ears done, 4 years ago, and the quality of the jewelery has only gone up.  And as a note, Ana is the best human being alive.   Go there!

First off, this place is a dive, and I mean a DIVE.  Every animal is on the wall here.   Their beer selection is abysmal, even for a dive bar....really, what kind of dive bar doesn't carry PBR?  I had the fish, it was nothing special, the fries tasted like frozen fries, nothing special there either.  I guess for a bar, it would work, but it's definitely not for my type.

For the first time, Yelp has burned me.  I see nothing but glowing reviews, but what I got wasn't amazing. It was mediocre.  It was taking everything I knew about good mexican food and bastardized it.  Who serves non marinated carne asada? Who serves up tounge that has been cooked to crisp?  First off, Carne Asada needs to be served up with lime and guacamole, not fried-ish with cheese.  And Lengua( or tounge), has a very distinct flavor, very hard to describe...something close to corned beef. This tasted like fried beef. And had cheese on it.  And the baby banditos are just like taquitos, and their "bandito" sauce is nothing more than  whipped butter with a few butchered slices of jalapeno in it.  Their salsa was tasty, that gets them a star. And they have awesomely large community tables, that gives them another star.  Don't believe the hype.

Oh Casey Jones, how you have failed me. I remember when I first came across you, free UFC, decent bar food, which included delicious fried cheese curds and jalapeno bottle caps. You even had decent beer prices! Terrible selection, but the price point was fine.   Recently though, things have changed. I'm guessing an ownership change.   New menu, which is ugly by the way. If you're not going to hold onto any of the train motifs in the menu, then why keep the thing on the ceiling?   Completely new and inept staff with glassy eyes, who don't seem to care at all. When I ask for tea, don't bring me Diet Pepsi with a lemon in it.  Annoying announcements 5 times in one night (yes, we know you're offering $4 Yager crap drinks, please stop reminding me, and no, having a child yell "get some" isn't cute. It's probably illegal.)  Understaffing the bar when there is a fight, so your servers are overworked and stressed, leading to problems & unhappy customers.  Serving cold food and pizza that tastes like dishwater.   I can't find one thing I like about you anymore.  I'm going elsewhere.

You want amazing breakfast? This is the place.  Here's the good: Great food, perfect portions, and awesome unique choices.  Here's the bad: A little pricey, and CASH ONLY?  Cmon people, it's 2009.  I'm not going to repeat what's already been said, but this place is a definite go-to.

Yeah...   Overpriced, greasy, and not really that British.  However, they have AMAZING Bread Pudding.  Simply incredible bread pudding.   A more detailed review...  Beer was way too expensive, service was slow, even for sitting at the bar, the fish fell apart, fries were cold and lumpy ( were not CHIPS), NO FULLERS.  The good? The relish served with the Ploughmans, and the bread pudding was amazing, warm, served with fresh nutmeg, awesome custard.  However, in the end, that's the only reason why this place gets a star.  Avoid this, pay less and get better food in Tempe, at Rula.

When I'm in Tempe, so far, there is only one place I need to go to, and that's Rula Bula.  I'm a huge fan of their sister place, Lis Doon Varna, and they basically have the same menu.  I love the fish & chips, and I have no problem downing 3 pints of Guinness there.  Great place, and great times.

Incredibly expensive when it's not happy hour.  However, I had a wonderful early dinner last night, as part of a meetup at Caffe Boa.  First off, walking down mill ave, you would pass this place, and not even know. In a way, I think that's good. Proper foodies and locals populate the place, and the bar is pure class.  Taking a look at the happy hour menu, I was at first turned off by 8 dollar beers, 15 dollar pastas,  and 36 dollar halibut, but then I realized something about this restaurant.  Everything here is sustainable, organic, or locally harvested. Now, while I think that is a great thing, I think that the prices are a little high, especially for something as simple as pan seared halibut. The price point knocks a star off.  However, the food, from what I had, was great.  I got the "Sustainably farmed in Washington Mediterranean varietal mussels steamed with shaved leeks, thin sliced garlic, white wine, shallots, parsley, and a touch of lemon/cream  served with  warm rustic bread", minus the bread (sadly, also helps knock that star off) at an amazing happy hour price of 7 dollars, and I was pleased.  The mussels were steamed perfectly, and had a sharp oceanic flavor that cut through the shallot cream sauce, making a perfect blend of both shellfish and sauce. Not once during the entire meal did I feel that any of the flavors overpowered each other.   I really did miss out on the bread, I would have loved the bread, because the sauce was that amazing. But I did make sure to scoop up the shallots with my fork.  Also, 3 pints of Mothership Wit on Happy Hour prices is a nice thing too.   Once I get a new job, I will be making sure to come back down here for more happy hours.

I'm torn with Sapporo.  On one end, this place has become a delicious restaurant, with great flavors and staff.  On the other end, this place caters to people who think they're are being "fancy", cougars, people with roofies, etc etc, you get the idea.  So for ambiance, it gets knocked down a few. I can only handle so much bass-blasting techno remixes of that santana song from 6 years ago.  However, the food is delicious. The las vegas roll isn't super bready, but light and delicious. Their sweet shrimp is meaty, and the shrimp heads are crispy and flavorful.  Their happy hour prices cannot be beaten, and for the first roll that I have ever had seared steak on it, very good.  I wouldn't go if you hate loud noises, or are craving a traditional experience. Most of the dishes are american fusion,  and of course, Teppan-Yaki doesn't exist in Japan.

Every once in a while, you eat a meal that is so fullfilling, so nice, that you walk out utterly satisfied.  That is how I felt when I last dined at Bouchon, 2 years ago.  Bouchon is Thomas Keller's attempt at bringing French Bistro dining to the affordable masses, and it works wonders.  When Sarah and I dined there, we first started with the Octopus starter, which was like a japanese style salad. It was crisp, refreshing to the palette, and was a fantastic starter. Afterwards, we were able to feast on the freshly baked bread and wine, while we waited for our dishes.  I had the Gigot d'Agneau( roasted lamb), while Sarah had an "Apricot Chicken" ( not currently on the menu).  My lamb, which was my first, was cooked perfectly. Savory and aromatic to the last bite. The red that was recommended paired perfectly.  The chicken was tender and moist, also cooked to perfection.  And, on Anthony Bourdain's recommendation, we had an order of the "Best Fries in the World", and to me, they were.  When I go back to Vegas, and I will, I will be making dinner reservations here again and again, and again.  As the French say, "Incroyablement délicieux ".

So, after hearing about Delux from co-workers and Yelp, I had to try it.  Getting there early helps, because the restaurant gets packed quickly.   First off, the place is ultra chic. A large bar/table is in the center of the restaurant, highlighted with blue lights. This place oozes of sleek.  But enough about the lighting, onto the food!  I got the Delux burger, which was incredible. Medium rare beef, served up on arugula with gruyere and a mixture of onions and bacon was incredible. The bun, a super soft baguette style was incredible as well.   Juice dripped from this burger. Not grease, but juice.  Pure, delicious, incredible, beef juice. If I could bottle and sell it, I would.  My fiance had the turkey burger, which was excellently spiced, a tad dry, but the aioli helped cover that dryness.  Their fries were also tasty, I enjoyed the ketchup and aioli. However, I have had better sweet potato fries.  Their beer selection is awesome, including selections from 4 Peaks, I had an excellent Kolsch-style lager, that complemented my burger well.  The prices are a little high, but the burger does make it worth it, both size and quality  On a final note,I wouldn't recommend coming here at night, it seems like over priced drinks, loud music, and lots of stuck up people.

I never in my life would have thought that mixing Chinese with Mexican would be a good idea.  I was wrong, and boy, I am so happy that I was wrong.  Chino is a strange fusion restaurant in a slowly dieing shopping center, but keeps up the business alone.  They mix bold flavors together,  and it comes out great. Cuban Black Beans, spicy with a hint of sweet,  Caribbean Jerk Rice, that stays absolutely spicy, and their mexican and chinese choices are amazing. The chinese ones have great sauces, and the mexican ones have been stewed to perfection.  Also, they give you snickerdoodles, fresh ones.  Excellent restaurant, I will continue to go as long as they last.

How have I not reviewed this place on Yelp?  I reviewed them for Check Please, Arizona!, a PBS review show. http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/. I could at least do a written review.   I've eaten at FEZ so many times, I can't count anymore. I think their burgers are some of the best I've ever had in the valley. Always juicy, I think the square patties are adorable.   The FEZ burger, with it's molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, providing fireworks for the tounge. Their Douxelle burger, with sauteed mushrooms, provolone cheese &  mustard, resulting in a subdued but delicious burger.   Their fries, which include normal, sweet potato, harissa, & garlic are also great, but I love the salad that comes default, including their lemon dressing.   If burgers & fries aren't your thing, they have Kisras( think like pizza, minus the cheese), and their daily specials are amazing.   One time, I was lucky enough to score the mushroom risotto, and it was perfect.  Sugar snap peas,   Drinks are fantastic too. A margarita that doesn't taste like chemicals, perfect martini's, and a G-Spot(grapefruit, pom, and vodka), make FEZ a perfect place for lunch or dinner.

Excellent.   Really, there isn't much to say. Carly's is a small bistro, offering an excellent beer and drink selection, along with your typical bistro fare, including wraps, sandwiches, salads, and some appetizers.   I met with a group of designers from around the valley to have drinks and some food. I enjoyed the Cuban sandwich, the filling of ham, turkey, pickle, and cheese, with a course grained mustard was very tasty, however, for a Cuban sandwich, the bread was a little too hard and thick for my tastes.  When I eat a Cuban sandwich, I expect a crunchy outside with a soft inside. However, the freshly fried potato chips were a great surprise, but I would have appreciated more of the sweet potato ones.  All and all, it's a great place, and I'll be going back, but my slight qualms take away that extra star.  Prices are moderate, with food running around $6-$11, and drinks running from $2.50 specials to $8 for beers. Hit up the happy hour, and the art/music is an excellent combination.

You know the phrase "A Diamond in The Rough"?  Greektown is that diamond. Nestled in an area where LoLo's would feel right at home, Greektown hardly looks like an amazing restaurant.  However, it is on the inside where the food really shines. The resturant is family owned, with the Mother actually in the kitchen, slaving over traditional dishes such as dolmas, gyros, falafel, and Sweetbreads.  That's right, Sweetbreads. I was warned by the owner when I ordered them, I assume most people do not know that they are the thymus glands of a calf. They were fantastic. Served in a simple tomato sauce, they were cooked to perfection and were warm and filling.   Every meal comes with soup and salad, the soup was a warm lemon soup, it was excellent, I even used the bread to soak up what was left in the bowl. The salad was simple, using feta, kalamatas, and olive oil.  My fiance had the chicken (I forget which ones),but it was some of the most tender and moist chicken ever.  And really, that is the key to this place, the simplicity.  From the throw pillows to the heart-warming and amusing owner, to the fantastic food.  The only thing missing from this place is the ability to toss plates, but then again, when we went, it wasn't super busy.  Opa!

I've been waiting for this, and today, I got my chance to try out the Cornish Pasty Company.   I will tell you now, this is a place for a true foodie. This is a dark restaurant, one that puts you in the kitchen. Literally. If you find yourself disturbed by seeing real kitchen professionals running around, then avoid this place.   Walking in, I felt like I was going into a dive bar. All of the kitchen staff is motley, and I loved it. We took two seats at the bar, and were greeted by an awesome server. She got us Guinness (poured perfectly, that gets a star), and we got to check out the menu.  Vast, is a good phrase for this menu. If you haven't had a Pasty before, I like to think of it as a Hot Pocket that doesn't make you want to die.  I got the Cottage Pie Pasty, and my friend got the Italian Pasty.   Our pasties were served on very distinct metal plates, with a sauce side. I had a red wine gravy, which was incredible. Tart and not thick at all. It was excellent. My friend had a marinara, he replied that it had a nice spice to it.  The food was excellent. My Pasty was filled with ground beef, potatoes, peas ,carrots, and cheese.  Warm, gooey, and it felt good being in there.  That is what I would say is the key to this place. You have to love it. You have to love feeling of the warmth every time the oven is opened, along with the following scent of roasted herbs and spices. The staff, rushing around, looking more like roadies than cooking professionals.  This place is real. It's alive. And it's good. Check out the menu, and go there. I will be going as much as possible.

It's hard to review Big Fat Greek when you've had obviously better greek food in Phoenix, but here goes.  Great service, they do put on a fantastic show when someone orders the "Flaming Feta".   Their portions are copious, but the gyro is usually dry, the beer is mediocre, and the pita bread was ok.  The positive? Lemon Potatoes. I could eat a vat of those.  And that's why they get a two. Good service, good potatoes.

I've noticed some people comment saying "I don't like Sonoran/New Mexican mexican food."  ...then why are you eating Mexican food in a primarily Sonoran Mexico area? Do you see an ocean? No, this isn't Baja.  Valle Luna is the premier place to get Sonoran mexican food. The portions are copious, the flavors are bold, and the food is consistently good.  I can't think of anything bad for this place.

I never ever thought I would find a dive bar like the ones in Flagstaff. Ever.  Last night, I was proven wrong.  The Lost Leaf is a pleasant breath of fresh air, devoid of the moronic masses that usually clog bars. There is fantastic art everywhere, and fabulous music.   And the beer listing is the best I have had in town. I will come here again and again.

Looking at the reviews of this place, I was hoping for at least a decent experience.   What I got was frozen fish, terrible sushi construction, and a spicy tuna roll that I almost couldn't eat, but did anyways due to the inflated prices, and some awful service.   I'll get the easy one out of the way. If you're the server and you see a stack of 4 dirty plates with two people who are still attempting to get some water our of empty glasses, pick it up, fill our drinks. It's simple.   As for the dishes, we started with the softshell crab roll, which had too much rice and no flavor. We then got the Dynamitex2 roll, which I had expected to be spicy. What we got was spicy tuna, topped with chili sauce. Normally, this would be fine, but instead of prepping their spicy tuna the traditional way (with kewpie & sriracha) it had jalapeño folded into it. The result was flavorless and burning hot.   Their spicy scallop was offensive, with a small amount of scallops mixed with crab meat and poorly shoved into a roll.  The tako salad was actually tako sashimi, which I won't complain about. The slices were cut perfectly and the sauce was wonderful. Easily the standout of the meal.   And lastly, Uni(sea urchin). I typically make my judgment on a sushi restaurant based on how they handle such a delicate meal. Typically, a good sushi chef tries to layer the meat in a way that the entire roll can be consumed. This wasn't layered well, and they used a good piece to hide some not good pieces.  I won't be coming back. Almost $40 for 5 items, I've had better elsewhere.

Is it too much to call these cookies godlike?  Because they are, really. I can't think of many times that I have had a cookie where I can taste every single ingredient in each bite.  I'm not joking. Upon first bite of an Urban Cookie (I like to imagine a Blood Cookie yelling "Wut up B!"), let's say the amazing Pineapple Coconut, you taste a savory buttery flavor, then an intense, and I mean intensely tart dried pineapple. The sugar, both in the batter and the toasted coconut that tops the upper layer of the cookie helps cut through the tartness and leaves a great moistness in the mouth.  Love it.  Also, the cookies are massive for their cost, the store itself is very chic and trendy, and the staff is very nice.  I would consider these for my wedding, but I don't think the people coming are quite good enough for these cookies.

Remember that scene in  "Harold and Kumar" when the finally get the burgers and it's amazing?   That's what eating at Lenny's is like. When you show up during the lunch rush, it's a madhouse. Fire, meat, people yelling, the smell of fries, it's amazing.  The  metal walls with neon and 50's pictures help increase the awesome of this restaurant.   They serve up a decent amount of food, from chicken, to burgers, to shakes and cheese fries. This place is very "diner", and I have always had great food here.

Usually, I would hate this place.  Every ounce of my body hates the kitsch.  Bears, everywhere. The napkins, the walls, the poor high school kid in the bear suit, all of it. Even the plates.  But their food is amazing.  The breakfast is filling, flavorful, and the variety is astounding.   From scrambles, to skillets, to steaks, potato pancakes, and pie, this place has everything one needs for a good breakfast.  What is an added bonus is that their food isn't greasy. Time and time again I have been to plenty of places with greasy food, and the Black Bear has constantly kept up great food.  Definitely worth going, over and over again.  However, I have never tried anything but the breakfast.

Ray's pizza is simple and unassuming. You're going to get big greasy pizza, which feels good to eat, and really, it's very NY.  My only issue is that when I want hot wings, I expect them be at least tangy.  Good prices, fast speed, and overall , a delicious pie.

FINALLY. A Vinyl store in Arizona!   I have been going to RHR since they first opened, as "the flagstaff guy". Since then, the store has gotten more awesome as time goes on.  The selection, the staff, all of it is awesome, and free stickers top this place out as one of the best shops in Arizona.

I had never thought it possible. An actual Dim Sum place that conjures up memories of Chinatown SF?   No. I must be dreaming. There's no way that I can get succulent Shumai, Steamed BBQ pork buns, Lotus wrapped rice, and fried Sesame Bean Curd balls in Phoenix, Arizona.  Looking back, it did feel like a dream. Everything was right, even the dumpy decor, and (ironically enough), a tv playing the P90X infomercial in the background.  English was poorly spoken, as it should be, and the items are easily identified by pictures on the menu.   Some oddities stood out, such as tripe, chicken feet, and shark fin, but I will save those for next time.   We got the typical items, including Chinese sausage buns, egg custard, and  cilantro-wrapped noodles, and it was all tasty. While not the best I've ever had, it was still delicious. Cheap too!  Be adventurous, and go here. I fear that without support, this restaurant will fail due to it's absolutely terrible location.

What I enjoy about this place is that it's simple, good, and fast.   Came here recently and enjoyed the Sacks Art Deco, which is your typical Italian sub, served up with some Salami, ham, provolone, Italian dressing, et cetera. It is rather odd it was served on a french baguette, but I'm willing to let it slide.   Really, theres not much to say here. They make sandwiches, and they make them really well.  All of the sandwiches are named after art styles or artists, which is a fun gimmick.   I intend on going back and trying more of their sandwiches, for sure.   Makes for a great fast lunch. Give it a try!

I ton of people seem to like this place, so I guess I'm going to be the bad guy.  Honestly, I've eaten at better Chain sports bars than this, namely BWW.   However, their wings are decent, and the service is good. But Macaroni and Cheese should not be soup.

Gyros are tough to rate. I am a firm believer that all gyro meat comes from one factory in the northeast. It really breaks down to what is served with them and how.  These guys make them right. Crispy,juicy, and overflowing out of the wrap. Served up with some delicious tzatiki. Fries are ok, they're fries. I tend to find that the gyro fills me.   I've also had some of their other items. The Falafel is wonderful, and the vegetarian platter is also great. Super smoky baba ganoosh, garlicky hummus, it's all pretty great. I've even had their Chicago Dog, which was perfect.  The only negative with their food is that their chicken tends to be a little dry, and the service can sometimes seem like you're bothering them.  But whatever, give me that gyro.

OI!   This is great food. I have had several types of fish here, the cornish pastie, the bangers and mash ( excellent!), Scotch Eggs, and the English Breakfast, which is sadly, no longer with us.  The owners are Brits, and they explained that there were no fish n chip shops in Phoenix, so I, for one, am very glad they opened this place.  A fine selection of beers and british treats rounds out an awesome restaurant, in fact, the only reason they don't get a 5 is the lack of English Breakfast. I want my Blood Sausage, damnit!

Never before on the mainland have I had sushi that has made me stop and really, and I mean, REALLY savor the flavors. Like the world slows down "Matrix-style", grinds to a halt. It's that good.  The last place that did that to me was a small place hidden in a business complex in Maui called Sensei, and since then, I have not had that experience.  Until now. Run out of strip-mall, a Korean Chef named Paul runs Yen Sushi & Sake Bar, and creates some of the most interesting and delicious sushi I have had the pleasure of having.  First off, the nigiri is very fresh, we had Spicy Scallops , Uni, & Smoked Salmon. The Spicy Scallops were exceptionally surprising, because the spicy sauce was not mayo-based, like EVERY OTHER SUSHI BAR EVER does. The result was nothing short of amazing.  The smoked salmon was melt-in-the-mouth delicious, and the Uni ranks as the best I have ever had. All roe, very sweet, and not over-powering at all.  For their Maki, we had the Heart Attack, which is basically the greatest Jalapeno Popper I have ever had. Extremely spicy Jalapeno, spicy tuna, real crab, and some sauces, deep-fried. Decadent.  Delicious.  Our other roll was one that was a mixture of fish, I believe tuna, mackeral ,crab, mountain carrot, a few other veggies, and some eel sauce. Very fresh, and incredibly awesome.  Delicious tea, and free miso, on top of an amazing atmosphere and an incredible chef, have made Yen the ONLY sushi bar that I will continually come back to in Phoenix.

This restaurant has been shut down before I could eat their delicious food. Alerting Yelp management.

Tried this place for lunch today, wasn't really impressed, seeing the number of 5's on here.  The french fries are frozen, floppy, and they don't have much flavor. Maybe I'm spoiled by In n Out's real potatoes, but I like my fries tasting like potatoes. And seasoned, at least.  The chocolate malt was also just ok. In fact, it barely tasted like malt, and was way too sweet. I prefer a less sugary chocolate taste.  And finally, the burger. I got their Wisconsin Melt, which is essentially a patty melt with two burgers.  It was well seasoned, but the seasoning was cut out by the amount of butter/griddle grease they use, so I could only taste the seasoning every once in a while, not good. Also, for a patty melt, there is a lack of onions, which I greatly disapprove of.  The whole thing was kinda greasy, and left a terrible feeling in my mouth afterwards, which is being currently washed down by a Becks.  In conclusion, just go to In n Out.

I love the Irish.  Good beer, good culture, and great food.  Lis captures all of that, and at good prices, to boot.  Their food is always consistent and delicious, I say eat the Bollix Balls and get some Fish&Shrimp&Chips. The staff is always friendly, I find myself at the bar with friends striking up long conversations with the bartender over a few pints of Guinness. And that's the best part. Nitro Tap Guinness, served properly.  You just don't get that in this town.  Other than a 10 dollar cover charge during St. Patty's day, I can't find anything wrong with this place.

I have to say, my first venture into the amazing flavorbomb of Korean food was indeed an awesome one.   First off, this restaurant is the definition of "hole in the wall". Family run, the interiors are not very fancy ( unless you want to look at the entire menu in picture format), but really, the food shines.   While their sushi looked very impressive and terrible for you, we decided to go for the Korean food, as we have friends in South Korea who rave about the food all the time. She had the Bulgogi, and I had a Kimchi based soup that had tofu and beef in it, and both were awesome. The bulgogi had a lovely sweet flavor about it, that highlighted the flvor of the beef wonderfully. I could easily get addicted to it. My soup was amazingly hot & spicy, with large chunks of beef and tofu. It was warm and fulfilling, I assume it's the soul food of Korea.  Also, the side dishes. They laid out about 7 different side dishes, each of them delicious. They ranged from cold daikon, to some sort of zucchini encased in pancake.    As for the service, it was super personal, and amazing.   I will definitely be going back and trying the sushi, which could secure that final star.

Yardhouse is interesting.  Great beer selection, but  usually overpriced, too rich, too salty, meh food.  Go for brews, maybe an appetizer, sit at the bar.

I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Z's yet.  I live in the north valley, and to be honest, there isn't much that isn't a chain restaurant. Z's stands out by making good, honest sandwiches.  They're a small ethnic market, offering up treats, drinks, and oddities from Europe, which isn't a bad thing. I've decided from now on to buy some odd European treat from them everytime I go.   Service is fantastic, always nice and warm, and they love compliments.  Now, onto the food. I cannot get over the Z House Sandwich. Served on a round European roll, this smoked ham delight is topped with everything. Red Bell Pepper, Cheese, all of the veggies, mayo and mustard, and served warm.    Basically, the entire sandwich just melds into a strata of deliciousness.  I've had some of their other sandwiches, including the roast beef and the egg salad, and both are delicious, but to me, NOTHING beats the house special.  Stop reading this, and go try them now.

I'm really surprised that so many people love this place, especially when there is better middle eastern food all over this town.  First off, I didn't really know who worked here, and who didn't, and thought it was especially rude of the gangsta busboy to cut me off and flirt with our hostess while she was seating us. Classy.   The decor is uninspired, and the service was decent. Our drinks were kept full, but I felt that our plates were thrown at us.   Onto the food. We first started with the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, which was a pretty decent hummus, not as spicy as I would have liked. It was smooth  My wife had the Spicy Black Bean Burger, and I had the Falafel Pita.  Presentation was nothing special, the idea of putting my foil wrapped pita on a plate seemed ridiculous, it would have made better sense to put it in a basket, or just handed it to me. As for flavor, nothing was exciting, minus the pickles, which were crisp and sour. The falafel tasted like a mix, the pita was dry and incredibly flat, the tahini was non-existent, and the way my veggies were arranged showed the general lack of care/love of food in the kitchen.  The black bean burger was much better, and is what earned the 2 stars in this review. The patty was flavorful, spicy, and great. The rest of the burger was uninspired. Vegetarian food can be absolutely amazing, and the rest of burger was a miss.   She enjoyed the included blue corn chips, but I thought they were nothing special, the salsa was salty, and the potatoes were not spiced, burnt, and really had no place or reason to be included with the meal.   I certainly won't be going back, but if I could purchase just those black bean burger patties, I would.

I saw there wasn't a listing for the new location, so I figured I'd add it!  Being a regular, I visit this place just about every Thursday.  The staff is excellent, while the tables can sometimes be a little messy, their are plently of napkins to clean up.  Their food is always great, the chicken can be a little dry sometimes, which is why I always get the grilled fish tacos, with a side order of hot shrimp.  Their salsa is excellent as well, and their beer selection is modest, but they have something for everyone.  This is an excellent place to go and decompress after a hard day of work.

This place is incredible.   From the guacamole that includes fresh mexican cheese & orange, to the perfectly, and I mean PERFECTLY spiced carnitas, I simply cannot find anything bad about Gallo Blanco. Even the chips and salsa were great, with fresh chips and some absolutely spicy/delicious green and red salsas.   Hip atmosphere, melt in your mouth pork, delicious carne asada, and great prices help round this place out for a 5.   Thanks again for the great meal, Gallo Blanco.

On the outside, Tiny's doesn't look like much. It looks dumpy, and kinda cheesy.  Their menu looks like a Charlotte's Web book cover, and upon entering, you've been transplanted to the midwest.  However, you get a fantastic dining experience. First off, the entire restaurant is run by a warm and welcoming family, I've never been given so many grins and smiles while I was eating and enjoying my breakfast, which is a nice change compared to the usual server walking by every 10 minutes to see how I was doing. Even the cook exchanged a joke with me, when the food came out super fast and hot.   We sat at their counter, which looked like it was transplanted out of a classic diner, facing the kitchen, which was fun because we got to see our food cooked by a stereotypical "cook", who was methodical & fast.   I ordered the chicken fried steak & biscuits, because I hate my arteries, and my wife got the "Hot Stuff", which was a scramble with ground beef & jalapenos. Both were definitely delicious. My biscuits were soft, the steak nice & tender, and the creamy pepper gravy was incredible. The hashbrowns were amazing, mainly because for once, they were not frozen bagged garbage.  The toast was your typical bread thrown on a griddle, no surprises there, and the 99ct coffee tasted like 99ct coffee should.   My wife's dish was cooked very well, although I would have appreciated some seasoning applied to the meat.  The jalapenos were spicy, and the rest of the veggies were great tasting.  This is the nice thing about Tiny's. It's pure in what they are, and what they do. Go for the welcoming atmosphere, the incredibly low prices,  and the chance to have what seems like a nice homecooked meal.

So, after a disappointing trip to the Bista deli, which was sadly closed, we ended up at Joey's.  And it was awesome. Chicago styled food, included Italian beef and dogs, sadly, no deep dish, and no gyros.  This is a place where you make your order and pick it up, so those expecting waiter service, not here.   Their menu is varied, but as I said earlier, I would have loved to have some other Chicago favorites.   I had the Italian beef, which can come in several ways, "Wet", "Dry", and "Dipped", all of which correspond to Au Jus application, I'm not going to describe them, its self explanatory. However, if you want to go for the "I'm not going to eat anything else the rest of the day and part of tomorrow" I recommend getting it "Joey's" style, where in a Philly twist, they pour on the molten Cheeze Whiz and Peppers.  The meat was well seasoned, and the jus made it good and messy. The cheese was probably horrible for my body, but delicious.  No liquor license yet, but that doesn't bother me so much, but I just know that once they get beer there, I'll be eating lunch there A LOT.  Fresh fries and the sandwich made for a hearty meal. Come hungry, because for the cost, about 8-10 a person, you get a ton of food.  The only reason this place doesn't get a 5 is because I've had the same things elsewhere, and they don't have gyros or deep dish.  But don't let that discourage you, definitely try this place out!

My final meal before leaving Phoenix, I was turned onto to Hula's because of a random friending on Twitter.   Having been to the islands a few times, I was intrigued, and convinced my family to go, and we were happily surprised.   i got the Butterfish, done Jamaican Jerk style. The fish came cooked perfectly, smothered in a spicy jerk heavy sauce. One the side, it came with plantains, which were lightly fried( but I suspect they were actually bananas). Crispy on the outside, warm and mushy on the inside.  The rice was decently cooked, and had great flavors all throughout. Lightly sweet, lightly spicy, it was great, but certainly could not stand on it's own. The johnny cakes, while flavorful, were very dry for my palette, easily the worst part of the meal.   The shining star at Hula's were the beverages. My wife got the Mai-Tai, which was as authentic as the ones we've had in Hawaii, and perfectly mixed. Her second drink, a Watermelon martini, tasted exactly like a Jolly Rancher, if you like that sort of thing.   I had 2 drinks, the Zombie and a Painkiller. The Zombie was fantastic, dark rum flavors and passion fruit swirled around in my tiki mug, and mixed with chunks of fruit to make a delicious beverage. However, the Painkiller was much better. Dark rum, coco lopez, fresh squeezed pineapple and oj worked together to make an excellent drink. I wanted 3 more of them, but I needed to get going.   When I return from NYC, I will definitely be checking out Hula's again.

I'll admit this right off the bat. I'm new to Vietnamese food, my first experience was Pho Avina, which set the bar high.   I'm very glad to say that Viet Kitchen has provided me a place in the North Valley for delicious food.   First off, the service is decent.  All of the staff is very pleasant, and food delivery is quick. The interior of Viet Kitchen make it seem like a 4 star restaurant, although I think the massive TV on the wall needs to be replaced by a painting.  Anyways, the food. It's what you'd expect. Warm, savory broth that you want to drink, fresh ingredients, fresh add-ons like basil and bean sprouts, and the noodles were well prepared a delicious. Add some sriracha and call it a day.  I had a Pho that contained slices of beef that cooked throughout the meal, along with meatballs. Now while I couldn't tell if the meatballs were homemade or not, they were still delicious. We also had the eggrolls, which seemed like they were more ruffage than actual meat, but the peanut sauce they came with was heavenly. I could eat anything dipped in that sauce.  Good prices helped round out a nice dining experience, and I will be back for sure.  I do wish they'd figure out their menu though, or at least get an editor. On that note, I do wish there were more items, maybe not "Cheesecake Factory" levels of menu items, but at least some more variety, like what Avina provides.   But for now, this place is great, and I can't wait to see it grow.

Went over here for a late breakfast, and was totally surprised with how delicious my Lox sandwich was.  The bagel was chewy, with a great crust, and an incredible amount of garlic on the bagel. I could see how someone could get annoyed by the amount of garlic, but garlic is pretty awesome, so take that as you will.  The sandwich was an awesome mix of the classic lox. Capers, Red Onion, Cream Cheese, Tomato, and delicious smoked salmon.   However, what really set this place apart was that they served the sandwich WARM, which I have never had before. Part of me wanted to think that it was odd, but my first bite made all of my concerns float away.  It turned the sandwich into an amazing mush of fish, capers, onion, cream cheese, and tomato, and at that point, I was sold.   I'll be coming back, for sure.

Why did I think going here was a good idea?  For some reason, I thought that Mellow Mushroom was going to be some kind of pizza bistro, with emphasis on the 60's. Boy was I wrong.   First off, this sports bar doesn't know what it is. Being a graphic designer, I know about the funky concept of branding, which this upscale TGI-Fridays completely tosses out the window. From the 60's font on the outside of the building, to the Modern skyline artwork on the walls, to the 10 different genres of t-shirts the servers wear, this place is chaotic and terrifying.   And the food experience was even worse.   First off, we got the Artichoke dip, which was ok. It was hot, which was nice, but I prefer a nice crust on the top of mine, which didn't happen.   Then came the 45 minute wait for our pizza, which was then delivered to another table. 15 minutes after that, our server realized what happened, and to be fair, she was very apologetic, and it wasn't her fault, it was the fault of the runners. So, they made up another pie, and a manager gave us a comp meal and 2 free pizzas, which is nice and earns them a star.   As for the pizza, we got the buffalo chicken pizza, which really needed more chicken and hot sauce. Most of what I had was a cheese & ranch pizza. The chicken was tasty, though very sparse, and the hot sauce was tangy, which is what I expect. I only wish there was more.   The dough was very good though, and the pizza tasted decently cold the next morning. Slight hints of sweetness come through the crust, which was nice.  However, the disaster that occurred there, along with the schizophrenic atmosphere has chased me away for good. I will be using those coupons though when the time arises.  Lastly, looking around at other tables, I do not recommend the Pretzels. I see that there is an image of them on here, DO NOT BE FOOLED. I see NO reason to have to wait 20 minutes for Pretzels that are not even the size of a hand.

Smashburger is pretty good, even though the decor is terrible.   I have been there several times before this review, so I'll make just a general review.   The burgers are juicy and flavorful, I highly recommend the Arizona, and the BBQ Bacon burgers. Fresh meat, freshly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The egg buns are perfectly toasted and delicious.   As for the sides, don't go for the onion straws. You don't really get enough, and the flavor isn't anything spectacular. If you're craving them, grab the BBQ Bacon burger, which is the perfect combination.  The sweet potato fries are basically sweet potato fries, nothing special.   The veggie frites are where it is at. Lightly fried and delicious carrots, zucchini, and asparagus.   My only issue is that the sides could be a little more for what you pay.  Give it a try!

Full disclosure: I love thai food.  I have an appreciation that is emotional, nothing lights up my life like a big bowl of Curry.  Tonight was one of those nights.   I've been here before, their pad thai is great. It's greasy, hot, and full of flavor. It's pad thai should be. Unpretentious, pure.  But tonight, kaeng kari is what I needed. Juicy chunks of chicken, flattened and grilled. Carrot, cut into the trademark star shapes. Potato, hilariously cut into thick ridged wedges. Think a ridged 1 inch thick potato chip prior to slicing/frying.  The green bell pepper, while tasty and fresh, could been more than 4 pieces. But that's a tiny blemish on an otherwise delicious curry.   Onto the spices. Cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic, salt, bay leaf, lemongrass,ginger ,cinnamon, and of course, cayenne pepper, all in a coconut paste. I like it spicy, so I order a 7 (out of 10), but I could easily eat a 10, as it's not that bad at all.   The food came hot, with a small bowl of jasmine rice, though you could easily just eat/drink the curry. If you haven't poured curry all over rice and consumed it, you're missing out on some magic.   First bite was beautiful. An explosion of flavor instantly rocked my senses.  I felt healed. And as I kept eating, the better I felt.   A great curry.  And I'll keep coming back for more.   As for the decor, yeah, it's horrible, but what great Thai place doesn't have some out of place decor? Service is wonderful, food is great, and like I said, a great curry.

Yogurtini is a funny place.   If you're a health conscious person, you can eat some very healthy ice cream and feel bad at the same time, as people take what is normally considered a healthy snack, and pile it up with neon gummy worms, chocolate syrup, cream puffs, and oodles of sprinkles.   The store is weight based, meaning that what you pay is entirely in your hands. You can do what I do, which is around $3, or you can go for the "All American" and end up paying $7-$8 for the Chocolate Syrup drenched Cream Puffs and marshmallow cereal with a tiny amount of chocolate yogurt.   Flavor wise, they run the gamut, and flavors generally change. I prefer mixing flavors, usually being guilty of mixing something with birthday cake flavor, then topping it with fruity pebbles & 1 cream puff.   It's a tasty treat, but by no means don't come here looking for "healthy" desert. You'll just end up ruining your diet.
