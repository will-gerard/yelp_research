Good dive bar in Scottsdale. No food just drinks. Come as you are and you should have a good time.

Good food beer and great service! Meredith is a bad ass the best server/ bartender here.

I just grabbed two burgers and a fry to go. I got home .3 miles away and my fry's were limp and room temp and the buns look like they are at least a month old to the point that I lost my appetite and  tossed them in the garbage.
