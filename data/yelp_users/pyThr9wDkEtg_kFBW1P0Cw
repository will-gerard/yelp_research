Awful experience today at brunch. A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad. So gross.  It Took 30 minutes to get a Bloody Mary. Over an hour for our food. The potatoes weren't cooked all the way. We were there a total of two hours for the two of us with normal breakfast and one drink each. Waiter was nice, but no sense of urgency from anyone that worked there.  Two other women and I were in line for the restroom and one of the cooks came out wafting his nose and saying, "you might want to let it clear out a bit before anyone of you use it." And laughed and went back to the kitchen.  Not going to return or recommend anyone to eat there.

I dropped off two dresses to get dry cleaned and I got one back with the back straps missing. I called to notify them, they could of not cared less, called me over a WEEK later, and I have not heard anything since. This happened a month ago. They also stapled through my other dress to attach the dry clean slip. DO NOT GO HERE! Your clothes will get ruined and they will not do anything to fix the situation!!!

The sushi was disgusting. Our waitress was very rude and paid no attention to is. The raw shrimp was cleaned at all and was a gray color. Never going back again, I would never recommend anyone else to either.

Best Vegan bakery in Phoenix! The staff is so kind and friendly to talk to. They are even willing to offer gluten free options if you call and ahead and give them some notice. Definitely my favorite sweet spot in Phoenix!!!!

I've been tattooed by almost everyone at The Golden Rule, and I can personally say that each one of them went above and beyond to prove the best service they could for me. The staff is very professional and friendly. The shop is in immaculate condition as far as it comes to cleanliness. I recommend everyone that asks me about my tattoos to go to them. And I highly recommend anyone in the Phoenix area to check them out.
