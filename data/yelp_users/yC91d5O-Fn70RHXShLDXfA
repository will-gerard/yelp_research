Overall I would say I was happy with my experience.   I walked up to the dealership ready to test drive a new Passat. Cory came out and greeted me, asked me what I was looking for, features, etc. I told him my list of needs and he asked me if I had considered a Jetta. I told him no that they were too small. I wouldn't say he was pushy, but the next thing you know I'm sitting in the backseat of a Jetta impressed with how much room there is.   Of course I had to take it for a drive and that's where I decided that Cory knew what I wanted even though I thought I wanted something else!   I wasn't really ready to buy a car that day so I figured I would tell them I only wanted a certain color with specific options that I didn't see on the lot. To my surprise, Cory made a call and found THE EXACT VEHICLE I was asking for at their overflow lot.   Again, I wasn't really ready to buy that day so I made sure I picked one of the most expensive Jettas they had and demanded a very unrealistic payment.   This is where they lost 1 star. The first offer they came back with was $11k higher than what I asked for. I told them we were WAY too far off and I wasn't going to budge on my price. They held me keys captive and begged me to let them work the numbers a bit.  This process tool about an hour and a half. Way longer than I wanted to wait. Somehow though in that timeframe, they met my demands!!! Somehow they figured out a way to close that gap and get me into the car for the price I wanted!!! I'm still not really sure how I got that deal, even Cory seemed impressed.   After that things went quickly. Finance was a breeze and didn't try pushing products I had no interest in.   Overall, I'll buy my next VW from Cory at Camelback VW!!

Shocker this place closed!  This location was open for a long time and was great for a lot of it. I don't know if owners changed or what but it went downhill fast. The service got awful and the quality of the food got bad too. I would be sad that this location closed but I had already quit going to this location months before they shut the doors.

Pretty much my favorite chain Mexican food. Although you have a lot of choice for great Mexican food in the area, it's a pretty good place and has a lot of menu choices

So, my wife received a $50 gift card for Olive Garden from her work for christmas. We decided to finally use it. We never really go here, we feel there are plenty of other better options. The breadsticks were not good. I remembered liking them in the past but they just tasted bad. I had the chicken parm and same thing. Just not good. My wife had a pasta dish and was not thrilled either. We both ate maybe half our plate. The check came out to like $28. We decided to leave our waitress a $22 tip, not because the service was great because it wasn't, but because we plan to NEVER return there. Too many other places to go that are good!

This place used to be way better a few years ago when it was a Dannys Family car wash. When Full Circle took over, things went downhill. It feels like no one takes care of anything and feels a little run down. It's worth driving a few miles down the street and go to danny's instead. Probably best to avoid this place.

Like a poor mans version of Sweet Tomatoes. Less choices and less flavor. It's pretty disappointing. Spend the extra couple bucks and drive down the street to a better salad bar, or go to a real restaurant

Well, it's not the worst food I've ever eaten. The food is a bit overpriced and very mediocre. Really, if you want some sit down Mexican food in the area, I suggest going just up the street to Nandos. Similar prices but better atmosphere and WAY better food! WAY better!

I needed a suit steamed and pressed in a hurry. This place said no problem, give us 30 minutes. Did I mention it was on a saturday?!? Not only did the have it ready in 40 minutes, they didn't charge any extra fees for getting it done so quickly!

I go to Liberty market as often as I can. The food here is great! I've tried many things from all 3 menus and have not been disappointed by any of them! I'm now also hooked on the cortadito (sp?) because Joe bought me one just to prove how good they were!   Everyone is always friendly and the food usually comes out fast. I really cant think of any complaints!! keep up the good work and if you have never been here, definitely try it!!

Had a really good experience here. The menu is kind of all over the place with meal prices starting around $7 and going over $30 per plate. It's a steakhouse that is decorated like a sports bar!?!  The food was good and even though I was with a large group, the service was great. I don't think there were any mistakes on our order and we always had beverages in front of us. I don't see myself rushing back here but would eat here again.

I love this place. I wish they would open even more locations around the valley. My favorite sandwich shop hands down!

I'm not really sure why people complain about this place. Do they have service fees? Yes. Are they SIGNIFIGANTLY LESS than Ticketmaster? YES!!! Never once have I seen the Marquee charge a $16.75 convenience fee like the dodge theater!!  Is the bar busy and maybe a bit over priced? Yes But I also had a friend go to Nascar last week and he paid $7 for a can of bud light. And the bartenders are super nice if you arent a rude or a douche!  Its a LIVE MUSIC VENUE and if you compare it to others in town, everywhere in the room has a great view, there is parking available right in front of the door (for a fee) and more often than not, the sound and lights are great.  People need to remember this is a business, not a charity. When you pay $30 to see a band play, who do you think sees the majority of that money? The band. I've been to many many music venues across the country and this is hands down one of the best.

I'm really sad this place is now closed. I spent a lot of my youth in this record store and also was exposed to a ton of music I would not have found on my own. Thanks for all the great memories and the great music!

So, I can't leave this store without spending at least $50. You cant beat the quality of the products they sell here. I've never been a soap snob until my wife bought me some Demon in the Dark. From there I started trying a few different products and I am sold. The employees are SUPER friendly and always willing to help and give suggestions. They will also give you samples if you want to try something first. The downside is it is a little expensive, the upside is you can read all the ingredients and the quality cannot be touched!

So its kind of an understatement that I am a bit of a picky eater. I pretty much don't like anything. My buddy Kris asked me to dinner one night and suggested to come to this place. He said it had good Yelp reviews and was close to his house. I reluctantly agreed, mainly because the last Thai place he took me to was kind of "meh". I'm very happy that I agreed because this place was awesome. So awesome, that I have been back multiple times!! I've been to a few other Thai places around town, many of which are good, but non as good as Yupha's!! I strongly urge you to try this place, I don't think you will regret it!

So I've driven by this place a million times and have never stopped to eat here. It had been recommended to me by multiple people so I finally decided to try it.   The Good: The pizza!!! I like Chicago style pizza and have had very good Chicago pizza, and I have had very bad Chicago pizza. This place ranks in the very good side! I can't say it sticks out but was just as good as I had hoped it would be. No complaints from me on the pizza. I also shared one of their canolis and it was also amazing. Loved it!!!   The Bad: The dining room. It is probably the ugliest restaurant I've ever been in. THE WORST!! This place has no atmosphere!! everything is painted dark brown. The tables and chairs look like they were left over from the family reunion 15 years ago. The servers don't carry anything, they push around plastic busing carts, even for drinks. Very weird and not at all inviting. Also, I had iced tea, it tasted like water. No flavor at all.   Overall - I gave it 4 stars because I will totally eat here again, the food was great. I'll just get it carry out!!!!

Best place to get pierced in the valley!! I have been pierced by Shane and he has been the most professional piercer I have ever met. He takes his time and makes you feel comfortable, letting you know what he is doing along the way. He defiantly takes pride in his work! The shop is VERY clean and comfortable and has a nice selection of jewelery. He also has some great tattoo artists that have tattooed some of my friends. I would recommend this business to everyone!

Well, I really wanted to try to find a good Thai place near my new house. This isn't it. Not even close. The curry (panang w/chicken for me, masaman w/tofu for the wife) looked more like a canned beef stew than curry. Both were a weird brown thick slop with chunks of brownish stuff in it. They both looked exactly the same. The also tasted sweet with a good touch of heat. I had friends at another table who ordered entrees and they looked much better than my curry. I am giving 2 stars only because the staff was really nice and helpful. If not, it would have only been 1 star.

Made my first trip to the Rose & Crown last night and I can't wait to go back!   I had a friend from out of town in Peoria on business and we were looking for a good place to meet in the middle. I suggested we check this place out since I heard good things.   The Good - Beer selection. This place has a great selection between draft and bottles and the prices are not bad either. I also love the charm of the building. As previous reviews state, it has a large front patio/porch and a bar when you first walk in the door. Each of the 4 other rooms is unique and equally comfortable. We also did the trivia and unlike previous reviews, i thought it was fun and the MC was not dry at all. Park in the garage on Monroe and 6th st and you can get validated for cheap parking even on game nights. Also, if you are into waiting hours and hours for fancy pizza, this is your best place to wait at!   The Bad: Coming down on a game night can have bad traffic and if you aren't aware that you can park for cheap with validation in the Monroe and 6th st garage, you may overpay for parking. If you stay late enough, the parking ends up being free! That's really the only negative thing I can think of and if you are reading this, you are now educated on where to park so you don't make the same mistake as me!   Overall: I can't wait to go back!!

I eat here at least once a week. I've been going here for over 6 years and the quality has never changed. I really look forward to eating here. I've had Thai from many places but this is what I compare them all to!

I have had some horrible movers in the past so I decided it was time to cough up a little more coin and stop hiring uhaul tweekers. I found these guys here on Yelp and read through the reviews. There were a lot of great ones so I decided to give them a shot. Here's how it went.   - I sent over an online request for a quote on Saturday. Even though it was not during their listed business hours, they still gave me a call. I wasn't near the phone so we ended up playing a little phone tag. Since we didn't connect on Saturday, they promptly called me Monday morning to talk to me about my move.   - We went over my needs and costs. We agreed on getting a 3 man crew. The price was $129/hr plus a $129 travel fee. No other hidden costs. All the dollies, moving blankets, and shrink wrap were included in the cost. I decided to go ahead and schedule for Saturday.   - Friday they called to confirm, made sure they had all my info correct, and said they would see me bright and early the next morning. 7am!!  - 6:45 Saturday morning. The truck rolls up, 3 guys get out and start prepping and ring the doorbell. They all introduce themselves and ask for a tour. We walk through and point out what's going and they start immediately. They came by to have me initial the actual start time and didn't start the clock until 7. They didn't charge for the walk through which was great!    - I sat back and did very little. I let the guys do their thing and tried to stay out of the way. They were careful with all my belongings and moved pretty quick.   - After about 1 1/2 hours the truck was loaded. They confirmed the address and cross streets and off they went.   - I beat them to the new house by about 5 minutes. They rolled up, gave them a quick walk through and off they went.   - Unloading was a little slower due to having to move all my stuff into a basement. Nothing to complain about though. They were still very careful with everything.   - overall it took 4 hours and 15 minutes including a 30 mile drive across town.   I spent a little more than I wanted to but I feel it was worth it. I was very happy with the crew and their professionalism. I will be using Just-In Time for all my future moves!!

The good: nice clean waiting room. A fridge full of sodas, fresh baked cookies ( in a toaster oven) and a brew by the cup coffee machine are all there for you to help yourself. The service was fast! Tire rotation and oil change was promised in 20 minutes, I was out in 15!!! Did I mention it was really clean and nice?  The Bad: a bit overpriced. $36 for an oil change, $15 for a tire rotation (they did give it to me for $10).   Overall: I'll be back. 15 minutes in a Saturday is impressive and to pay a few bucks more o save an hour of my weekend is well worth it!

So I drove about 50 miles to eat here. I live in Gilbert now but lived in Florida for the past 4 years and had a mellow mushroom right by my house. I've been back in AZ for a few months and was very excited to hear there was a MM in town even though it was an hour away.  The Good - Food. All of it. We brought family there for the first time and had lots of food. We had the parm & Garlic pretzels, Hummus, and meatball appetizers. All were awesome. Their hummus is probably my favorite. We also got 3 different pizzas and 2 salads and everyone was very happy.  Everything tasted just like I remembered from Florida.  Exactly what I was looking for!  The not-so-good - The decor. Hands down. Whoever designed this room must have designed it for another restaraunt. All the previous MM I have been to have had a really cool "hippy type" charm and were really comfortable. the decor matched the menu design and the logo. This room is cold and very modern design trying very hard to be ultra-hip.  Not what I was expecting. Very disappointing.  The beer selection here is very good but rely's heavy on the Rogue and Four Peaks breweries. Previous MM I have been to had more of a variety from many many breweries with a much larger selection.  Overall - I'll be back. The food is great and if I close my eyes I can pretend I'm sitting in a more comfortable room!

Went to the door and was seated by security guard. He only had one menu and said he would try to find another. He did shortly after. Very limited menu!! Waited about 10 minutes before any waitress came by to take drink orders. Another 5 before she came back with drinks and took food order. Ordered a waffle. Was supposed to come with fresh strawberries and whipped cream as well as a side of hash browns and an english muffin. I got a cold dry waffle with nothing on top of it, a piece of frozen butter that wouldn't melt on a cold waffle and cold syrup. Then I had to ask for the rest of my food from the runner. Brought me uncooked breakfast potatoes (i ordered hash browns) and an untoasted english muffin. My wife ordered a breakfast burrito that was supposed to be egg, cheese, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. got a egg and cheese burrito, some raw potatoes, and an untoasted english muffin. Waitress never came around to ask how food was or bring any drink refills. Other 3 tables around me all had problems too.I don't know what was worse, the "service" that was nonexistent or the uncooked and/or raw food. I will never go back for food. I would give 1/2 star if it were an option. If this place doesn't step up it will be closed in no time

pretty sure I called this one! It's really a sad thing the employees were not paid, there is no excuse for that. Please read the other reviews and boycott the owners other businesses.

So I'm the most picky eater and Jimmy Johns caters directly too me!!! I really hate lettuce and most other vegetables. Jimmy Johns lets me order my sandwich "slim" which means no veggies or sauce (they will give you mayo/mustard packets) and actually charge less!!! So, I don't have to worry about asking for my sandwich without_____(fill in veggie here) and having to pick it off! GENIUS!!! I don't live in their delivery area but if I did I would also be stocked because they deliver with a 1 sandwich minimum!  I hope they build more locations around town!

I can't get enough of this place. I consider myself a bit of a taco fan and this place keeps me happy! Also the salsa bar is pretty creative. Only complaints are if you order their amazing horchata, it only comes in one size which is a bucket and the other complaint is they only provide 1 small basket of chips per table, any more will cost ya like $2!?! Forget the chips and spend that on another taco!!

The good: The price. $4.99 for all you can eat  The Bad: Everythig else. The food pretty much sucks. Its edible but the ingredients are cheap. The majority of the customers are SUPER trashy and there are kids running around everywhere. I guess thats what to expect at a cheap all you can eat buffet!  Overall: Avoid this place at all costs unless you are on welfare, are a bum, are missing more teeth than you have, or have no tastebuds

This is the best tattoo spot in Phoenix! Very small art type space with 4 of the most talented tattoo artists in town. You cannot get a bad tattoo here. Very comfortable and friendly. I recommend to everyone!

I have been a patient for about 4 years. I started at their previous location and saw Dr Smith. I wasn't really a fan of him so I stopped going there.   I was looking for a new dentist when I got called to schedule a cleaning. I let them know I was unhappy with Dr Smith and they advised he no longer worked there. They also had moved to a new location. I decided to give them another chance and I sure am happy I did!!   I now see Dr Mayer and am very happy with this office. Dr Mayer is very friendly and gentile and seems really passionate about the work he does. I also have had nothing but positive experiences with the office staff and Megan has been nothing shy of amazing. I am happy I gave this office a second chance and have been referring friends and family here who also love it!!!

Terrible. I was really disappointed with this place. I didn't go in with high expectations since its a franchise in a strip mall, but it was worse than expected. They were out of baked potatoes (which were the daily special), limited side dishes which were already pre-packaged, and the meat was just "meh", nothing to write home about. I did like the sauces bust did not like the hard, dry rolls and didn't understand why the meat plate included a raw onion!?! I was excited to have another food option near by but I don't plan on returning. If you want chain bbq nearby,  go to famous daves. If you want great local bbq nearby, go to Joe's! If you want overpriced mediocre bbq, eat HERE!
