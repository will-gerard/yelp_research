This place is great. The sushi is delicious, there's not a long wait time on the sushi orders and the employees are very attentive. I also love the intimacy and ambiance of the restaurant. Definitely would recommend this place to my friends and family, or a really nice date.

Trying to find a good nail salon has been tedious for me. They did a good job but I have one peeve. I got a full set with gel overlay and my nails came out bumpy. They're supposed to be smooth with the overlay. Plus, they don't have a waxing room. They do it in the front where everyone can see. Not one to get embarrassed, but I'd rather people not see what I need to have pulled off of my face... Or other places... Overall though, they're very attentive, quick, and friendly. I'd go here again, just not for the gel overlays.

Don't ever order from this location. Not only did they arrive late with my food (delivery) but it looks like they just threw all of my food in a bag and sent it on its way.

Terrible. Don't ever go to this restaurant. My fianc√© and I thought it would be convenient to order online and do car side pickup. When we arrived to the location, I had to get out to get my food. Not only that but they didn't have some of the food ready. I always already waiting an extra 20 minutes just to get my bag, which they offered no compensation for the additional wait. Upon getting the food, the ribs were burnt; the fries were limp and tasteless; the chicken penne was rubber and not made with penne noodles and the mozzarella sticks were hard. I will never ever eat here again.

Horrible service. My boyfriend and I seated ourselves and two waiters came to take our drink order. When we began to order out appetizer, the waiter walked away. No one payed attention to us for the most part, despite the fact that it wasn't busy, and we had different waiters and waitresses the entire time. The sushi was good but the yakisoba lacked any taste. Spices don't mesh well with my stomach, so it was either make it bland, or end up throwing up later on. This place needs to step up their service and their food. Will not be back again.

I don't recommend ever coming to this location. The associates that were working at the store left me at the door for the first 10 minutes without so much as an eye glance or "hello". It wasn't until 4 other people came in behind me into the store that one actually helped anyone out, by taking down our names so "no one was skipped". Horrible customer service.

I love this place. The staff is very friendly and attentive and they greet you right when you walk in the door. They're quick to serve you and don't keep you waiting for extended periods of time. I also love that it's right next to the perch, and while you're eating, you can listen to the birds morning calls. The only thing that ruins the ambience are the flies always buzzing around. I feel like something can be done to prevent them buzzing around you the entire time you're here and possibly ruining your food. I, in particular, am vey grossed out by flies simply landing on the cup that I'm drinking it of, let alone my food.

This place has absolutely the worst table service. When I walked in, no one acknowledged me. I walked in and sat myself and was ignored for the first 15 minutes until someone came and got a drink order. After that, no one checked in on me for an hour. I barely got my check 45 minutes after I was done eating and I waited an extra half an hour for someone to come and get it. Don't eat at this location unless you feel like spending your entire night waiting for service. Not only that, but the same food stayed on the turn style belt the entire time I was there without being replenished so the food sat and got old. I won't be back.
