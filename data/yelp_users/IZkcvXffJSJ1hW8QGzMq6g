I am so sick and tired of coming to this Mexican restaurant for a $5 burrito and not getting what I order. I order a carne asada burrito every single time I come to one of these places. And this place which happens to be right behind my house always shorts me on my  guacamole always always always.. the last time this happened I tried to bring my burrito back in return it but they would not accept it and told me that I had to buy another one. You know what after tonight I will start going to 75th Avenue and cactus to that fast food Mexican place to order Mexican food. I don't care about the convenience of being right next to my house you guys suck. If you want you can either make it up to me and buy my family dinner or I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever come back to your restaurant ever I promise! Give me what I pay for when I order it don't Short me and then have me eat a dry nasty onion field cilantro covered burrito with steak and no guacamole

Not to mention the 52 handles! But today I tried the baked Italian sub, let me tell you about the baked Italian sub, the breading is very flaky and light, it is amazing, the best part of the baked Italian sub with the tomato inside. The cheese completely coats the tomato and makes the sandwich what it is. The baked Italian sub was the best Italian sandwich I have ever had in my adult life!! I can remember having the first spicy Italian sandwich at Subway after eating countless turkey sub sandwiches and this baked Italian sub was like losing my virginity to a sub sandwich all over again . I am not joking. I am NOT being over sarcastic. The baked Italian sub was absolutely amazing.. HEATHER SERVED US, SHE WAS AWESOMENESS! !  She was really really fun and really outgoing and she described the beers in great detail to us! I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu. Thank you Tailgaters for moving close to me and making a meal very EASY & AFFORDABLE. I think i will have to come back for dinner now to compete with my lunch! Thank u Heather!!
