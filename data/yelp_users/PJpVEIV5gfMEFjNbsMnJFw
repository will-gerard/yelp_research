We took a van of ours to them for a transmission issue and after multiple times trying to fix it we ended up taking it to another company who repaired it properly for $2500 after we had already paid A to Z about $2500 to fix it the first time.   We actually were awarded $1000 on this deal from small claims court but the owner has not paid yet.

Love the BYO Burger Night on Tuesdays. Half off! It's a huge burger, cooked to perfection with a premium, brioche-type bun. We ordered fries on the side. They come in your own little fry-basket. Drinks were great! Service was excellent. We've been 2-3 times now and we're hooked.
