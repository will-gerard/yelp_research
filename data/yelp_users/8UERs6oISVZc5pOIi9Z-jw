This place is freaking awesome. Burger is on point. It's outside and you will probably have to wait a little bit, but trust me, it is worth the wait!

I've been filling my scripts here for almost three years and Chris always goes above and beyond to make the process as easy as possible and answer any questions. Sometimes the wait for the drive-thru takes awhile, but you can't always have it all.

SOOOOO GOOD! I've been looking for a good Chinese place down here and so far every delivery place I've tried has been mediocre until now! We got the sweet and sour chicken, Kung pao veggie dish, and fried/white rice. All delicious and the delivery man was really nice too! (Took a little over an hour though) 100% recommend!!

Always takes forever and they have forgotten some of my order and still charged me for it THREE TIMES. The third time I called the store and they brought the pizza ... OVER AN HOUR LATER. Legitimately HATE this place. Pizza isn't bad though.

LOVE Hanny's!! I've been coming here since I moved to Phoenix a couple years ago and I have zero complaints. You ABSOLUTELY MUST try the arugula/prosciutto pizza, it is to die for, no joke, if you were to eat a pizza in heaven I'm 99% sure that's what it would taste like. Can't go wrong with the Martinis either... And if that wasn't enough the atmosphere is great... Make sure to go upstairs and also down to the basement... Trust me ;)

For the price it was amazing! Only downside is you have to wait awhile because they are so busy, but that's a good thing, right?

Love everything about this place and I've been a ridiculous amount of times... If you haven't you're missing out big time!

I have had 2 or 3 previous experiences that I really enjoyed taking out from here (obviously why I kept returning). My last time was very disappointing. Not only was my order not spicy at all (I ordered it hot) but I couldn't even eat it and ended up throwing $20 of food away. Major bummer. Really want to give it one more shot because of my previous great experiences with the same dish, but also nervous about the inconsistency.

I am officially addicted to the standard burger and fries. Like this is a problem, someone please help me. Drive thru is on point and the people are SO incredibly nice. But even if the people were rude and I had to move from my vehicle, I would still be swarming this place. Delish.

Yes x1000! You have to wait to be seated, usually for awhile... But after you order food is served very quickly, and it is ALWAYS worth the wait. Eat here. End of story.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES HIRE THIS COMPANY!   WORST MOVING EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE!!!!!   ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!  (At least read the terrible ending to the experience).   They were over an hour late so I tried to call them and they didn't answer for another hour, and replied saying they'd be there in 45 minutes then NEVER showed up! I kept calling and calling and finally someone called me back saying they'd be there at 7PM instead of 7AM ruining my entire day of moving.   To make matters worse they were lazy, threw my belongings around, and put everything right inside the door instead of in the appropriate rooms (ALL BOXES were labeled).   Oh and it gets even worse because they were smoking cigs and talking/hanging out on the clock and then stopped 40 minutes early and still charged me for the entire time!!!  MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!! The icing on the cake was that they couldn't work pay pal so wanted me to give them my debit card number over the phone to their boss before they would leave.... THEY ENDED UP STEALING MY CARD NUMBER AND ORDERING $90 OF PAPA JOHNS ON IT THE NEXT DAY!!!  I called and left two voicemails that were never returned. Needless to say this entire company is a scam and I filed a police report on their CRIMINAL behavior.  PLEASE DONT MAKE THE HORRID MISTAKE OF MOVING WITH THIS COMPANY!
