I don't want to give 1 star but have no choice. Had to grab a taxi from PHX after coming home from Grandmother's funeral. Taxi driver accused me of trying to cheat him out of money once we arrive at my place. Told be not to slide my card, which I didn't,  but didn't say not to touch the screen. Proceeded to go on a tirade about how I didn't want to pay him so I touched the screen too early (total had said $12 instead of $16 (the airport base rate). I proceeded to tell him in choice words that wasn't what I was trying to do. He then told me to "act like a lady" and not curse. I told him I'd say whatever I wanted when being attacked. Whole thing ended with him telling me f*ck me and my grandmother...among other things like how i was "white Phoenix trash". This guy was Arab and driving van #4830 or 4380...don't remember because I was so mad. Have yet to hear back from anyone regarding my email to the company. Disgusting service that doesn't seem to be a one off based on the reviews!!!

Easy to get around. There are many services and restaurant available to people with long layover. Security never takes a long time. It is clean. Most of the gate areas have  charging stations.

Have had my stuff stolen from here TWICE.  Both times I had a heavy lock on the locker door. First time they used bolt cutters and the second time was today when it seems they were able to pick the lock. First time their security camera wasn't even working to see who came out and this time I didn't even bother asking because the person only took my credit cards.  Don't go here!!!

The slowest bar ever ... Not busy at all = A cup of water = 10 minutes Salad = 40 minutes every time :(

5+ stars for customer service! 4 stars for food  We went with a group...7 in total and received great service. They were on top of everything...drinks quickly refilled, food came out fast, and they were attentive the whole time. We ordered a variety of food(coco chili fish, jalepeno fried rice, curried duck, tom yum...) It was excellent and the portions were huge. Everyone took food home. Only gave it 4 stars because their "spicy" wasn't spicy enough for some guests. Overall a really great experience and we'll be back soon - likely to try their happy hour specials!

Food was great, as usual, but management really needs to do something about the service. Every time we come here for lunch we wait and wait and wait. There are usually only 1-2 servers downstairs and half the time they cant be found. Its ridiculous.  Then, they leave tables full of the dishes from previous customers and take forever to get them cleared off. Its actually quite disgusting.   Management: get a clue!

We ordered the vegetable samosas, onion kulcha and tandori combination. The spinach paneer was amazing. Everything was cooked well and seasoned well.  Going back very soon!

Hands down, it is the best barbecue restaurant I have ever been at. We were a party of six, and we ordered many different kinds of food and shared it all. The catfish was our least favorite dish. However, everything else was beyond amazing. We all agreed that the corn, mac and cheese, and cornbread were the best things ever ... Personally, I think their mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese dishes on earth :)

Pacific has been our go-to buffet since 2006. This location consistently delivers good food and good service...especially if Lisa is your server. Id give it 5 stars but it is a buffet and the quality decreases a bit between 3-4pm when they are switching from lunch to dinner. The sushi is great.I like the variety of deep fried to specialty to hand rolls to nigiri. Always of good quality. The mongolian grill is a nice addition although I'm usually too busy eating sushi to take advantage of it. Salad bar options are a little weak, but you shouldn't go to an Asian/seafood buffet for salad. Lots of dishes with varying types of protein including tofu for vegetarians. Great to finiah off your meal with one of their many cakes or a scoop of ice cream (they have like 10 flavors!) Go get yourself some Pacific!!

Kabuki is a fantastic place to get pretty authentic Japanese sushi - it is one of the few places our Japanese friends like to go! I regularly go there for happy hour - they have a pretty good selection of drinks, appetizers, and sushi. Some of the items I regularly get are the mozzarella tempura, the firecracker, gyoza, and the bbq beef ribs. Their dinners are also good - bento boxes are the best! The only reason why I can't give Kabuki 5 stars is due to their service. We go there a lot and it's really hit or miss with the servers - some are great, others are so-so.

Went for lunch. Nice seating indoors and out. Quiet though for lunchtime. We had the koobideh and the chicken kabob. Lunch comes with salad and rice as well as a grilled tomato. The food was great EXCEPT that one of the tomatoes clearly had mold on it and the chef/owner tried to say that the tomato changes to white/grey mold color when cooked. So not only did he give me mold to eat but then lied about what it was.  4 star food but 1 star service from the owner *disclaimer* our server was great however ...not sure if I should go back...should I?

Deceiving from the outside but great food inside. Service is okay... Not overly nice but not rude either. We got number 63 and number 141. Both of them were really good. Huge quantities. And very tasty. The food was really fresh and the prices were reasonable. Not a place to go for date night but a good spot to get some good Vietnamese food. Oh and don't visit the bathroom.

McDonald's french fries have nothing on french fries from Smashburger...skinny, crispy perfection. Their burgers are good too. I've eaten here just twice but each time the burger was good. This time I had the truffle mushroom and swiss. A little less garlic would've been great but overall a 4 star burger.  Service was quick..no complaints there.

Checked this place out Sunday afternoon for lunch. It was quiet and not too busy inside- the outdoor seating was packed and the only table that was left was directly in the sun. We were a bit bummed about that as it was a nice afternoon. We were seated at a really small table in the back room. I don't understand why nice restaurants seat people at tables that barely hold any food.  The free and fresh bread that they give is really good. The texture and flavor is amazing. We ordered the mozzerella salad and the biancoverde pizza to share. The salad was fantastic. I liked the pizza but thought that it would have been better if the crust was a little more cooked in the middle of the pizza. Otherwise, it was quite good.  The server was nice and was attentive at first but we had to wait about 10 minutes to get her attention to get the check.  Overall, we like it and will be back to try more items on the menu!

Delicious! The shave ice+ toppings combo is amazing. A great selection of flavors, toppings and glazes. We tried strawberry with mochi balls, mango pudding and condensed milk. I love that the shave ice isnt overly sweet. Fun interior, clean, friendly service... Will return to try more flavors and the bubble tea!

QT is the best gas station/convenience station I've been to on the US. Here's why: 1. Workers are always friendly and greet you 2. Always clean...bathrooms included! 3. Great selection of products...especially food and drinks! 4. Their frozen drinks are amazing!! (According to my wife) 5. I like their donut selection  6. Gas prices are reasonable

Busy at lunchtime with a variety of ages of customers. Nice play area for kids. Parking is an issue as the cars lined up for the drivethru make it impossible to park on one side of the parking space. Entrance only on 44th...can't be accessed from Indian School Rd. Service is good and quick. Appreciate that they always bring food out to you. Quality food with good portions. Wish they had a drink station to refill your own cup.

Upon walking in the restaurant,  we were a bit put off. There was a strong sewage smell and the interior looked like it had seen its best days in the early 80's. HOWEVER, we stuck it out and ordered. The food was worth enduring the smell. We ordered chicken biriyani and chicken tikka masala. Both were some of the best we've ever tried. A little disappointed that rice didnt come with the chicken dish and cost extra...but even so, it didnt dampen the experience. Like others we were given a complimentary drink (pink lemonade) and dessert (donut holes in syrup), which was a nice add-on. Service was very good. The gentleman that waited on us was very friendly and quick to help us.
