This place kinda reminds me of Patty's pub from it's always sunny.Not much action going on and mostly dudes hanging out shooting the sh!t.The service is good,the food is okay and they have an arcade punch machine that I enjoy wasting my money on.

Worst experience ever! I had four trips to this place in one month..The doctor was trying to juice me here and there.Other then the gal named Crystal the staff was lost and none of them were on the same page.A lot of he said she said going on.I'm going back to Sam's club,never to return!

I enjoy the beer selection they offer at four peaks.The service is pretty good, I do like sitting on the patio most times.The food is okay but whenever I eat their chicken strips and fries I can feel my arteries clogging up so be sure to avoid them if you're sensitive like myself.The parking can be a hassle for most people but I don't mind the walk. Alot of beautiful women work there so that's always a plus.

They only take cash and it's in a not so nice area.I'm the only one in the drive-thru yet it still takes a good 15 mins for my food.The staff look like ex-cons/trailer trash.As for the food it self it's nothing special.The fries are bland and the fish is ok.The pete's sauce is pretty much hot sauce and ketchup.Total hole-in-the wall kinda place

They do have some cool stuff,I'll give them that much. The pay out for the top shape stuff I was selling them was laughable. I made waay more selling it on amazon than what they offered me.EVERYTHING is over priced and a good portion of the staff was rude. I won't be coming back anytime soon. As for the guy that was a total jerk to me.Keep in mind that you're a grown man working in a record store that you don't own.Your parents must be proud.

This place is a time machine for me. It's kinda like a well maintained pawn shop,minus all the dirt and angry shotgun wielding employees.They have alot of old action figures,VHS tapes, magazines,and gaming systems from the 90's which is awesome.The staff is friendly and helpful. If you're into old cool $h!t like myself. Be sure to give Bookman's a look.

It's always a good time when I come here.The service is great and the coffee is pretty good.A nice environment to read a book or do homework.I really enjoy the decor of the shop as well. 5 stars baby!

I started training at Az combat sports nearly 3 years ago. At first I wasn't sure if it was for me. As time went on I found myself enjoying it more and more.The instructors are the best and the facility is up to par .I've check out other gyms in the valley but I always find myself back at Az combat sports..I really wish they taught us how to counter a tombstone piledriver.

Everything about this place is awesome! The name,the customer service,the selection,everything! I went in looking for a figure that I couldn't find and they offered to order it for me. that was very cool of them to go out of their way.The guy working there has a habit of saying "Worst_________Ever! Being a die hard Simpson's fan that I'am it really made my trip more enjoyable.Everything is fairly priced and they have free wifi.I will be sure to try the coffee the next time I'm there..

A good place to train. The facility is large, clean and the staff is very friendly.The Instructors are pretty cool and knowledgeable.It makes me feel like Chuck Liddell when I'm in there.Now I just need a head tattoo and a mohawk!yeah! UFC!

Never again will I be coming here.I had 2 unfortunate visits and they were both equally painful.First off the bouncers are tools and they all look as if they were suffering from severe constipation. I should be glad that they're working security instead of an occupation that requires intelligences. I was wearing my hat in a normal fashion and they found it to be out of "regulations" so they made me pull down my hat until the brim was touching my eyebrows.Of course, I adjusted my hat to my preferred setting as soon as I got in.Second off the bartender was off in her own world and was very rude because I requested a beer while she was in deep conversation.Don't worry darling your "guy" won't be walking off anytime soon, it seems that he's been drinking heavily and has trouble standing up.Third off, the demographic of people here,Holy geez! some of the most self centered, self entitled group of people I've ever dealt with.I wandered off into someones booth on accident to take a seat and some girl flips out on me like I broke something.Settle down woman, it's 130am there is 30mins left before this place closes. I think the party has already surpassed it's peak.So all this cussing,yelling and name calling is not necessary.As for the second trip? You don't want to know.
