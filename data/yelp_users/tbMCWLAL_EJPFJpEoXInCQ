I recently was in town to celebrate my birthday and was on a mission to find the perfect boots and some killer denim. After visiting Nordstrom, Barneys and Saks I was starting to get discouraged because I wasn't finding what I wanted. Lucky for me I came across Hub Clothing. The moment I entered this boutique I knew I had found a denim goldmine. The denim selection was amazing; they offer all my favorites along with skinny/long options. (Being a 29x34 it is very difficult to find denim that fits properly.)  The customer service was stellar! I literally tried on 10 different pairs of denim, but the sales clerk was very helpful with her suggestions and willingness to grab me different sizes. I went in looking for a new pair of Nudie denim but walked out with 2 pairs of Naked and Famous along with a pair of boots. I look forward to my next visit to Arizona so I can go back and shop at HUB.  If you love denim, Diesel and G-Star then this is the place for you. It definitely isn't the cheapest fashion spot, but that is to be expected when purchasing quality clothing. I have done a lot of shopping in my 32 years and I think that HUB Clothing is my new favorite store.  Five stars for inventory and customer service.   See you in December!

I grew up in Arizona and always enjoy visiting to enjoy the great restaurants. Chelsea's Kitchen is now one of my favorite dining spots. I recently was in Arizona for college graduation and my parents took me to Chelsea's Kitchen to celebrate.  The atmosphere is great and the service was fantastic. Most importantly the food BLEW MY MIND! Everything I ate was delicious! I recommend the tacos, (I personally had the swordfish tacos) homemade guacamole and make sure to try the ceviche.   My dad had the burger and he raved about how great it was. I was also surprised at how delicious the French fries were.  I have always been a huge fan of Le Grande Orange, but I think Chelsea's Kitchen is 10 times better!   I can't wait to return to Arizona to enjoy this place again!

While visiting Vegas my local friend took me to Piranha to experience Vegas nightlife. I was unprepared for the $20 cover but later learned that this was a standard cover for non-locals.  I was unimpressed with the crowd, the ambiance and the size of the club/bar. We stayed for about 25 minutes and I will not go back. This place just isn't my scene.  Cons The go go dancers are allegedly straight and didn't dance, they just ran in place. The crowd was tired, unattractive locals The dance floor is itty bitty and no one even danced they just stood around looking at each other.  Pros You can smoke inside, but that is available everywhere in Vegas. There are no slot machines.

The Fashion Show Mall is everything a mall should be. It includes all the relevant department stores including, Saks, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Dillards and Macys. The mall is huge and and holds many gems including Zara & Mango. If you are looking for disposable fashion make sure to check out the GIANT Forever21.  I would recommend this place solely on the department store selection. I always go to the mall to grab lunch, the best restaurant options are the Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus cafes.

.Giant Coffee is the newest venture from the creative genius who brought us Matt's Big Breakfast and Roosevelt. Similar to these other hot spots, Giant Coffee is ultra hip and doesn't disappoint.   While in town I met with a friend for an espresso, and instantly fell in love with the space. The coffee shop offers a modern and hip retreat from the cement jungle. I am a sucker for ultra modern loft-like spaces so instantly I loved the vibe Giant offered. While I was there they had the space opened up so we had the pleasure of enjoying fresh air while sipping the rich, dark coffee.  The coffee was delicious. I am happy to find a non corporate chain coffeehouse in AZ. The baristas were friendly hipsters, so I felt right at home. =)  There is a $5 minimum if you use a card for payment. But, use a credit card so you can check out the Square technology on their iPad.  This place is top notch and a welcomed addition to my future Phoenix visits.
