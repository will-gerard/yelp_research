Update as of 2/20/16: New ownership as of this year. In less than two months they killed the free towels, the 5000 mile club (great self-motivation tool) and are removing the basketball and racquetball courts. Time to move on.  Great, no frills family-owned gym. Plenty of machines, free weights, basketball and racquetball courts, pool, spinning and aerobics rooms, and perhaps most important, no annoying overcrowding issues! Been coming here for a few years now and don't see myself going to any other gym in the area.

Been here regularly since the opening, and between the wife and I we've tried almost every entree and have loved every one. The mac and cheese and tavern steak dishes are particularly good, and the hunter's burger is a great choice if you're looking to save a few bucks. There is are also different specials almost every day, so no two visits ever need to be the same unless you like it that way.   They have a good draft selection and excellent signature cocktails. Wiith an intimate atmosphere this place is perfect for couples and small to medium groups.

Fantastic atmosphere and service, excellent food. Beers rotate regularly but they always have 5 or 6 on tap, and they make some very unique stuff. Come every week and try something new! Parking and seating can be tough on busy nights, but a major expansion is a few months away.

Updating my previous review to mention how amazingly they pulled off their expansion. Additional seating capacity, great open atmosphere tasting room, and now 30+ taps. Their only problem will be brewing enough beer to keep them full!
