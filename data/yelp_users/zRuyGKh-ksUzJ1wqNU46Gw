I was in Phoenix on business, and a few co-workers and I wanted to do something as a group. One of them saw this place while driving around, figured out what it was, and found out they give tours. We reserved spaces for us on the last tour of the day. They have different kinds of tours; just the tour, ($15), a tour with an appetizer ($25), a tour with lunch ($35), and a couples tour with wine ($80). There is valet parking, and there is also free self-parking about halfway up the driveway. If you decide to use self-parking, there is a little bit of a walk uphill with stairs, but it's not too bad. We entered through the restaurant instead of the front door, because valet parking is where the front door is. There were quite a few people on the tour - about fifteen of us. My co-workers and I were definitely the youngest ones besides the tour guide. Lol.  The tour guide was great! If you're her employers and are reading this, she had brown hair, was wearing all black, boots, and necklaces. She didn't stumble, and her presentation of information came off sincere and interesting. She was lively, and she was knowledgable. I would definitely recommend you take the tour with her. The mansion itself was pretty. It was definitely older. If I remember correctly, it was built in the 1930s. I wish the mansion had a lot more of the original pieces, but i loved that you could go almost everywhere in the mansion and touch almost anything - besides the piano. The hand painted ceilings were my absolute favorite part, and the view didn't hurt either. We enjoyed happy hour following the tour. They have half off appetizers and wine, as well as a few other things. It was a beautiful day, and the weather was great for eating outside. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

Let's start off by saying that Ted was a fantastic bartender and host. He was lively and cheerful, and he definitely made our dinner experience great. He's an older gentleman, who is very welcoming and hospitable. As soon as my co-worker and I sat down, he greeted us and helped us out with menus and information. We asked what he recommended, and he pretty must listed everything on the menu. Lol.  We chose this place based on reviews, and we were so glad we did. The food was delicious. My co-worker ordered the Thai Sushi Roll with the side salad, and she said it was the best meal she had in the two weeks we were in Phoenix. The roll had avocado and macadamia nuts. The salad had kale. I ordered the veggie burger, and I enjoyed it. It came with fries.  The place was filled with lots of people from surrounding businesses. All the men were in button up shirts and the ladies in nice slacks and skirts. I liked the atmosphere. It was very social, and the place was lively.

This is my second time flying out of PHX on Southwest Airlines. The first time was last week, which wasn't too bad. It's just the gates are thisclosetogehter. Seriously. Thisclosetogether. So, that means that everyone is thisclosetogehter. I guess it's great if you want to make friends that way or like to smell people.  Well, like I said, last week wasn't too bad. This week? THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!! Delay. Delay. Delay. It seems like every flight has a delay in Terminal C. And the gates keep switching! Over the intercom, so and so flight has moved from gate blah to gate blah, and so and so flight has moved to blah blah blah BLAH BLAH BLAH. FYI, I live at the airport here in Phoenix now. I'm sitting in a chair in Terminal Four (4) somewhere in the C Gates. Visit me. I think I'm just super annoyed, because they said thirty minutes. It turned into an hour. Now, it's even longer. Oh, and at a different gate. AAARRRGGGHHH!!! Seriously. No one around me looks happy. Oh, and they don't have outlets on their airplanes and barely any in the terminal. My phone is dying. I'm sad. The end.

Atmosphere: This place is by a bunch of businesses, so there are a lot of people that go here for lunch. It can get pretty busy!   Service: The employees are friendly. There was only one day when they were a bit backed up, because they were down two employees - but they didn't seem too frantic.  Food & Drinks: The food tastes fresh, and I don't feel guilty after eating. Everything is healthy and delicious. I pretty much ordered the same thing on every visit - a turkey burger and soup. It was all delicious every time I ordered it. It was nice that I got great food every time. It was consistent. My co-workers were so much more healthier than me. The whole reason we went to this place was for their Kale Tonics, which is a refreshing beverage (if you like that kind of stuff). Lol. I'm not much of a kale person, but everyone else enjoyed it. They have a nice "pick two" for lunch with your two choices of soup, salad, or sandwich.

Today's lunch was brought to you by Rainforest Cafe. There was a bit of a wait when we got there - as there was only one person seating people. But the person (or tour guide) seating people, Patty, was very nice and informs you of everything that goes on and everything around you as she walks you to your table. Our server, Joey, came to our table almost immediately. We had a coupon for a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree. There were four appetizers to choose from, and we decided on the mozzarella sticks. Yum! We ordered (and split) a chicken sandwich as our entree, and I got a strawberry lemonade. The food was surprisingly really good, as I read all the bad reviews during our meal. The service was excellent! Joey was fantastic and friendly, and I would completely recommend him. Overall, it was a great experience!  P.S. The ceiling is SOOO beautiful!

YUM!!! I would recommend this place if you are in the Phoenix area. My co-worker and I heard nothing but good things about it, so we decided to check it out.  Atmosphere: The exterior is quite deceiving. It looks like an old, big shack. The interior is gigantic and cozy. It is clean and organized. There's a pretty bar area, a doughnut station, and lots of tables. They have a separate area with another bar that I think is used for private parties or probably weekend nights. There were some cool decorations on the walls all over the place.  Service: It was great!!! Our server was so knowledgeable. She was friendly and personable, and she had fantastic, flawless makeup! Lol. A manager came by our table to see how we were doing during our meal. It added a nice touch knowing that they cared.  Food: Delicious! Cornbread? Yes! I ordered the grilled shrimp with macaroni and corn. The shrimp was cooked to perfection! And the seasoning was great. It was also great on the corn. I probably could've just eaten corn as a full meal and been happy. Hehehe. The macaroni was delicious, but it was as good as my mother-in-law's. Lol. My co- worker really enjoyed her meal - pulled pork and coleslaw. We split a dessert - the mud pie, and it was good, but we were hoping it'd be on par with the rest of the food. It wasn't, but it didn't take away from the meal. The best was probably the doughnuts!!! They give out free mini doughnuts. They are fresh and sooo wonderful!!! Don't forget them on your way out!

We had a fantastic experience! We found a $37 deal on Living Social, and it included finding out the gender (which we already knew, but it's good to get a confirmation), hear your baby's heartbeat, a CD of all the pictures, and a gift bag (that has coupons and formula). Our baby is a beautiful baby boy! I couldn't help but be sooo happy to see his handsome face in 3D - even if he tried covering it the whole, entire time with his hands. He even kicked the camera a lot of the time. I got a little fighter, but he's been like that with every ultrasound I've had. He has his daddy's nose and his mommy's lips. I can't wait to meet him in real life... but I, also, can! He has seven more weeks to get happier and healthier! It's located in the back of a business plaza, which was a bit hard to find. But the lady working behind the desk was extremely nice and welcoming. The place was clean, and there's a comfortable, nice waiting area with a television.  The room where the ultrasound is held is comfortable. You lie on a bed while your spouse/partner, friends, and family sit on couches around. There's a gigantic screen for everyone to see the baby on.  We completely enjoyed the experience, and we would so recommend this place to anyone who wants to meet their little one before they arrive!  Thank you, Maria!

We had a coupon for a buy one, get one free hot dog. So, my boyfriend got two chili dogs with everything on it. One chili dog is $11.45 plus tax. He's never had Nathan's hot dogs before, and he quite enjoyed them. He had been talking about hot dogs all vacation. Of course, they aren't as good as Pink's hot dogs (on La Brea in Los Angeles, CA). If you haven't had those, it's totally worth the long wait in line.

I just had lunch - a delicious caprese sandwich! I have had the pleasure of visiting this location in the past - plenty of times, and I mean... plenty! It's definitely a Las Vegas staple for me every time I visit. Usually, I stay at Planet Hollywood, which makes it so easy to enjoy this place more than once, but this visit we're staying at another hotel. I still made the time to visit! Anyway, you order with the first register. You pick up snacks and sides and beverages along the way to the second register where you pay. The potato salad is sooo good, and I'm picky about potato salad! The brownies are a good dessert, too! For two sandwiches, it comes out to $14.03 (with tax), which isn't terrible... because they are quite filling! Overall, another excellent visit to my favorite sandwich place!

The best free thing to do in Las Vegas. I had the time to do this on my last visit to Las Vegas, and I enjoyed it. So, I decided to do it this year. Lucky for me... they were paying guests to watch a show! Yay! I got $20 to watch a decent show (or at least, I thought so), and then I got asked to come back as part of a round table group to talk about the show. For that, I got $50! Woo! Hoo! $70 for two hours of my life, why not? I quite enjoyed the experience. I don't know if they always pay their guests, but even if they don't, it's still a good, free experience where you can preview new television shows. I totally recommend it.

First, the employees were SO friendly! They made small talk with me while my pizza slice was heating up in the oven. That's so refreshing! Now, the food was good - not the best, but it's a good, quick slice of pizza. I got a side salad, as well. It's supposed to be a small ceasar salad, but I can't have ceasar dressing. They were nice enough to give me a side of ranch dressing! (Thank you!)  So, for a slice of cheese pizza, a side salad, and a regular beverage, it was a little more than $12.

My boyfriend and I had a coupon for $10 off $30... so, why not? We went for lunch. When we walked in, we asked if we could sit in the bar area and use the coupon still. The hostesses, who were holding menus and ready to seat us, said yes. We ended up seating ourselves like normal customers who decide to sit in the bar area, but we were completely ignored for a good seven to ten minutes or so... without menus! Finally, our server came up to us and asked if we needed menus. Duh. I have never been to a Buca di Beppo in my whole, entire life, so yes. I would very much like a menu. Well, the server ended up being pretty nice, though. He took our order in a timely manner, and he refilled our drinks when needed. I ordered the baked ziti, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken carbonara. The chicken on his dish wasn't all that good, as it tasted like frozen chicken or pre-cooked chicken. Other than that, the food was good. Our bill came out to $27 after the $10 off (without tip), which isn't bad, because we didn't finish our meals and had leftovers to take back to the room for dinner! I would rate the experience as three and a half stars... but I'll round up.

The place is pretty big with lots of machines and actual games - like ring toss, ball toss, balloon popping darts, etc. It was busy and packed with children when we went around dinner time. I don't know if it's that busy all day, but is assume it is. Children really have nowhere else to go in Las Vegas besides arcades.  I liked the variety of games, and most of them are twenty five cents! Sooo appreciate that. Did I mention I'm a sucker for arcades? Like most places, the prizes aren't the best selection, but that's how arcades make their money. Anyway, it's all about the thrill of playing the games and trying to win tickets! Right?

Although the chicken bowl I ordered had decent flavor, the chicken was absolutely dry, which kind of stinks. I feel like the price you pay is based on the meat, and if the meat is yucky, you just paid for pretty much nothing. Plus, they give you a little packet of salsa in a little plastic container like BBQ sauce from a fast food restaurant. That's when you know it's not good, fresh salsa, and you probably shouldn't open it unless you're desperate. I left mine in the bag. The price is rather high for what you get, which many reviews on here state. I should've read reviews prior to ordering, but it was enough food for me at that moment in time. I don't know when I'll be in Phoenix again, but I highly doubt I'd be going back to this place if I do.

We had a coupon for a buy one item and regular lemonade, get one item free. So, we got a regular cherry lemonade and two pepperjack cheese dogs.  I've had both before, and you can't go wrong. This location was no exception. The girl working behind the counter was very sweet and friendly. She took our name when we ordered, and it wasn't too long before she called it out telling us our food was ready.  Overall, a great experience!

The building is an old church. It's beautiful - inside and out. It is still kind of shaped like a church... with the bar as the alter/shrine area and the kitchen behind it. The bar is decorated nicely. They have a big chandelier in the center. The top of the walls by the ceiling have painted murals. The whole, entire place just has a great atmosphere. The place itself is in a little corner with a Starbucks and a Buffalo Exchange. My co-worker and I sat at the bar. The bartender, Eric, was friendly and provided outstanding service. We never had to wait long for anything, and our drinks and chips and salsa never went dry. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice - no beans. It was a very generous portion. They were delicious! Seriously. I ate what I could, but I couldn't finish it all. I took what was left of it back to my hotel, and I actually ate leftovers! I never eat leftovers! Lol.

I enjoyed this evening's dinner at Sugar Factory. I had been to the one at the Paris Hotel last year, and when I saw a Groupon for this location... I knew it was a must! We paid $30 for $62 worth of food and beverages! It's such an amazing deal! But it's not good for desserts. We ordered: an American Honey drink for $12, a frozen hot chocolate for $9, the chicken parmesan for $17, and the steak bernaise frites for $25. After our Groupon, we paid $6 plus tip.  The drinks were SOOO delicious!  The food was good, too! The server was friendly, but she was quite busy with a lot of tables. Understandable. It took a little bit for our food order to get to us, but our drinks came out really quickly! But it was okay... as we weren't in a hurry and were enjoying our drinks.  Seriously... buy the Groupon. SOOO worth it! :D

We saw the show last night using the Living Social deal we got. It was $49 for two tickets (or $28 for one), and all you have to do is go day of to the theater to pick up your actual tickets. They'll try to upgrade your tickets to VIP for $20 each. If you want to increase your chances of being part of the show, it's worth it... or if you want to be closer to the action.  The theater isn't raised seating, so you got to cross your fingers that you don't get someone too tall in front of you. Also, it's under construction. There are tarps up everywhere, and the ground is broken up in places. They have caution tape up. I guess it adds to the theme...? The show itself is pretty good. It was a lot better than expected. Most of it is quite cheesy, but I'm a sucker for cheesy. The only part I really didn't care for was when it got quite preachy towards the end... making it awkward. They have different acts, like most Las Vegas shows... singing, ballet, acrobatics, contortionist, etc. During the show, they hand out jello shots, which is a nice touch. At the beginning of the show, a lady comes around asking if you want to buy drinks. I'd say it was a good show, but I'm good with just seeing it once.

It's located in the MGM'a food court.  I had never seen this place before, but chicken sounded good. I ordered a five piece chicken tenders with fries for $9.95 and a cup of water to share with my boyfriend.  They give you a pager after they ring you up to come back for your food. It didn't take too long, and when I was called, they were very nice and gave me an extra side of sauce when asked. The chicken tenders were really good. The chicken wasn't dry, like I expect most chicken tenders to be, and their original sauce is good - although... I don't know what it's ingredients are. Lol.

I guess this place is new, and I couldn't find an existing review page for it... so, I decided to make my own. It was much needed. My boyfriend and I were a bit hungry, so we decided to share something. We decided on pizza, as the price was decent... not, like, $13 for a sandwich.  When we got up to the register, we were not greeted. There were freakin' three men behind the counter pretending to work and chatting away with each other. One of them even passed by the register a couple times without acknowledging us. My boyfriend wanted to leave, but I didn't want to spend much on food, and pizza sounded good to me.  Finally, one of the guys washed his hands and took our order, but that was about five minutes after we got to the register! Anyway, we ordered a #5 - small cheese pizza, a drink, and buffalo wings. The food sits under lamps, but still... they tasted pretty good. Fine. You get one star for that. Otherwise, unfriendly employees. Bad service. This place is definitely not worthy of anything other than one star. I'm sorry, but Pizza Hut Express, you should try harder next time.

Well, this Starbucks has one of the nicest display areas I've ever seen. It looks so clean and organized. The condiments table was clean and stocked. The employees were alive and friendly at 7:30 in the morning. They were all smiling. The employee who rung me up, T-Rex (on his name tag), was patient when my mind blanked at the register. I failed. I know. There were two people in front of me. I had time. I should've known what I wanted. Nonetheless, he was patient and nice. My drink was perfect. Yup. My grande cinnamon dolce frapp. was yummy-licious. Cinnamon dolce is my go-to drink, and it come in a sugar-free version. I tried the new ancho-chili chicken panini. The flavor was good for a quick, heated up sandwich. I don't know why this place only has three stars!
