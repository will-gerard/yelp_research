Eggs Benedict were good not great. But the staff was very friendly and attentive. Good american breakfast place. Close quarters for seating, reminds me of being on a ship. That's a good thing, because the quality of service also is cruise like. I will be back.

If I could give zero stars I would. This place was not good at all. The food was over priced, over cooked, and oily. They claimed to not have chips on the weekend. But they did have them available for Nachos which were bad.  The service was slow despite having a small dining room and 3 servers working. Maybe I should have been drunk or hungover.  Because the folks around us had menudo. In any case their Special was anything but. And $6 for a kids meal with 4 nuggets. Even I wanted the toy. Bottom line is a learned its way better across the street or next door. If you are in the area go anywhere else.

Fake warranties on their batteries. Pay extra for a premium battery with extended warranty and 6 months later they won't honor the warranty without a receipt. Shady business here. Go to Sam's Club or Walmart for better prices and service

Great local diner, Great service. Food came out fast even though the place was packed. Dining area was tight. Reminded me of the cruise. But the good news is that I loved my cruise. neighborhood hang out and tourist, this is a great place for breakfast.

My Wife says best Mac n Cheese Ever! Everything was fresh, place was clean. Felt like I was in the best restaurant ever. places were very reasonable given the quality. Service was the only sub par thing here. And really the only thing preventing a five star rating. Server forgot to put in our "small" order of sweet potato fries, then brought them out as we were about done and still charged us for them. Great place, I'll chalk the server up to inexperience. Truth is everything else was so good, I didn't want to complain. Which I usually do. I'll be back, in a different section next time. Complimentary Valet as well

Awesome service, good food, right prices. And the have a Big Bryan Sandwich.  I will be back for the chicken. The Brisket, Pulled Pork and Pork sausage won out today. I'm taking home breakfast and lunch for tomorrow. Really a gem in the east Valley.

Good food, the worst customer service ever. The fact that I wanted to eat in was my first mistake. Counter service only here. Why they have tables is a mystery.  They should just have a window for carry out or take away only. Sad because the food is good.

Awesome food and service. Always quick and friendly what more could you want from a lunch place. Daily special is great but everything is fresh. Even the horchata.

Poor Customer service from the beginning. Did not enter the coupon correctly. Dirty tables. Sad because it's a brand new venue. Staff needs better training and management.
