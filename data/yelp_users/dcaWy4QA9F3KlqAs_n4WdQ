Quick, fast and cheap.. and decent food for the price, service and ambiance oopsI mean a no ambiance but hey they have the best tortillas in town and those hole in the wall places have the best food sometimes... In this case it was delish!  I don't mind that it was dirty!  LOL!  Had the Machacha Burro and it was all shredded beef but damn it was good for 3.50.  I can understand why the place is packed to the gills during lunch as I had been working near the airport and nothing too exciting around there without driving too much further during a short lunch break.  Friends ordered beef tacos and cheese enchaladas and said they were great!  Will visit again!

Always have a great time here.  I am from Tempe so very convienant.  Have visited the new Salt River Fields which is very nice compared to this stadium however it is always a good standby!  Great views and fun times had by all!

YUMMY!  Had both chicken and beef and YUUUUMMMMEEEE!  I'll pay attention to the saltiness I never noticed that, but from what I know I could eat at this place everyday and never get tired of it... And it's not 15 bucks for a meal!  You can get the 2 peice chicken combo for 5 bucks7 bucks for beef... water, bing bang boom you got yourself a nutritious meal, for cheap!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Had a simple salad... Butter lettuce, walnuts literally that's it with salmon. Something like $12 for it and it literally looked and tasted like they just threw the items on the plate. No tossing or arranging or anything. At least the lettuce was washed. The salmon tasted frozen and had huge peppercorns crusted onto the top... I was hungry so I ate it but was not happy at all this was their idea of a $12 salad. My boyfriend had the adriattico boa? I think that's what it was and said the tomato cream tasted like the vodka sauce from Safeway... Cafe Boa used to be good, now not so much.  I think it's lost it's luster and they have a lot of nerve charging the prices they do for mediocre food. Probably won't eat there again.

If you want to be surrounded by young kids getting their kicks... be my guest... used to be a cool place and is no longer... I give it 2 stars because the bartenders are fast but have no personality whatsoever and and there is no ambiance at all to this place anymore... Plus the fact that they violate Arizona smoking law by allowing people to smoke within 20 feet of the entrances, INFACT lastnight there was someone smoking INSIDE the side door!!   ALL I CAN SAY IS... DISSAPPOIONTED... NEVER AGAIN!!!

Went here lastnight with family and really like the place.  Atmosphere is awesome and there is so much to look at!  That said the service was as expected, fast, and they clear the tables as you clear your plates!! WOW, what a novel idea!!  I thought that was very customer focused.  The food was delish!  I had the fish tacos, shrimp and salmon with the fruit salsas and OMG!!  I wanted more even though I was full!! The chips and salsa are even more addicting here, something about the crunch, and the salsas were not too spicy and actually a little sweet!  THE FLAN WAS FANTASTIC!!  I highly highly recommend for awesome Mexican food, perhaps the best Mexican food I have had in my 10 years living in AZ!!

Ordered ahead, due to a slight hangover and wanting to be at home.  But when I walked in I was impressed by the warm feeling.  This restaurant is a narrow "cave" and lives up to a typical Brit pub with wooden walls and low lighting.  Didn't wait long for them to package my food.  I ordered the Oggie and Royal with Cheese, and OMG!!  My son and I shared.  He was finished with his before I was half way done with mine.  The Oggie had steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga and the crust was light and flakey.  The Royal with Cheese was a burger patty with onions, mushrooms, cheese and french fries, OMG!!  Perfect cure to a hangover or just a great dinner.  A little heavy for lunch but the menu looks to have other great options.  I will definately try this place again and will sit down to eat there sometime soon!!

First and last time i go into this place...  Let me say first that I have always wanted to come here just to have a sit down with friends and drinks, but it so happens my son and I walked in one day after a busy day of errands.  I did not want to cook and it was on our way home.  I was disappointed right off the bat because we sat down and I don't know what, because it was just me and my son, but no one wanted the table, (I know how it is, i used to wait tables) but we waited patiently and after about 10 minutes server came over and said he did not see us and apologized.  More than likely taking a smoke break due to he smelled like smoke.  We ordered nachos and cheese sticks, (weren't very hungy) and they were fine.  My complaint to this place would be that I went to ask if they had SunBru from Four Peaks and in Tempe you should be carrying FourPeaks anything at all times, in my opinion!  The server I asked said yes they had it and then my server came back to get my drink order. I asked and he said he would check and came back and said infact no they did not have it.  I settled for an FP 8th street Ale.  The server seemed nervous checking on us, not sure was that was about but he rarely came by, my son was never offered a refill on his drink and I was not offered another beer... seemed weird for a bar... anyway we waited about 10 minutes for the check and when we walked out after completing the transaction, no one said a word to us.  Very strange place.  I can see the neighborhood bar attraction and I wish it was different but I will not set foot in this place again.  Will stick with the ol standby, Four Peaks and never stray again!

Med Fresh is delish... Always get the Chicken Kabob .  Our visit last friday was very enjoyable!  The food is cooked fresh and the service is superb.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, the hummus was very creamy.  The salad and dressing was so fresh.  Every flavor on the plate complements each other and to top it off the garlic paste is to die for!  My son had the Beef Gyro and loved it!  All in all this place is great!

Copy of a letter I sent to the President of Chronic Tacos:  Dear Mike,  Today I decided that I was going to walk further on my half hour lunch today to get a fish taco from your establishment.  Since I only have a half hour for my lunch I needed to make a phone call to my Doctor and while on the walk there they had me on hold.  When I entered Chronic Taco, on Mill Avenue in Tempe AZ, I was greeted warmly and a young woman took my order.  While the fish was cooking my doctor came on the line and I had to proceed talking to her knowing that my order would be coming out soon but when it did I politley gestured that I would be just another minute.  The young lady knodded at me and set my taco aside to help other customers.  Then to my surprise the older blond haired lady that works there yelled at me very rudely and said, "Mamn!  Your taco is ready!"  I was still on the phone with my doctor so I gestured again to her that it would be another minute.  She then proceeded to pick up my taco and walk it towards the kitchen while rolling her eyes to the cashier then slamming the tray down on the kitchen counter.  I saw this and was flabergasted!  I reacted by saying you can keep it and that I won't be coming back!  I love your food and and to be treated this way, as if I don't have a right to talk on a cell phone on my half hour lunch, was completely out of line.  I hope that you can do something about rectifying the situation with the older blond lady, I mean she never smiles when she greets anyone!  Then this!  You have lost a valuable customer and probably more of a steady customer base from my office since I had to share this story everyone around my office.  Customers should be treated with respect no matter what!  Aside from the fact that I had to immediatley walk back to my office with no lunch and an empty stomach the rest of the day.  If she just could have waited for me to finish my phone call all would be well.  Please respond as I will not be setting foot in your establishment ever again due to this woman's bad day or bad attitude she has towards her customers.

I love this place!  First time visiting and it was around 6pm and had seen it driving by the place a few times decided to stop by and try it.  Walked in and it was very clean, and the very nice lady at the counter greeted me with the typical thai hello.  She engaged me in conversation while my food was cooking and she was very pleasant.  She explained the menu to me and that all the entrees come with rice.  I decided to try my default thai dish, Pad Thai.  I went with level 3 spicy.  I also order a Thai Tea and Green Tea Ice Cream.  while they cooked the Pad Thai she made the Thai Tea and let me tell you this was the BEST Thai Tea I have had!  It was just the right sweetness and not too bitter... We discussed the togo menus and I saw that they had coconut and green tea ice cream I asked her favorite and she recommended the green tea ice cream I ordered that as well.  The pad thai was ready within 10 minutes and I advised her of the tea and how delicious it was and I am sure I would be back.  Got home and ate almost half of the PAD THAI it was fantastic and believe me I have had some really good pad thai and this was great, the tofu was firm on the inside and crispy on the outside and the shrimp was perfectly cooked and not overly firm.  The flavor was not too spicy, it was just right.  I had the green tea ice cream for dessert and it was perfectly soft and creamy with a not too bitter taste and just the right sweetness.  I will go back to this place as it was really good!!  And the lady at the front counter, KUDOS for your service!!

Beer was good. Food, if you want to pay 11 bucks for a soggy bread sandwich I guess you could it was OK... Service, horrible. Sat at the bar, had to ask twice for beer because no one came to us... and when we ordered food we asked what they recommended they told us, Chicken Club, so we ordered that. When it came we asked for mustard and got a sigh from the bartender as if it was a chore to go and get it. Never got a check back, like no one asked if our food was ok.   Second time asking for beer took a while ... Different bartender man as if it was a chore for that too! She was bitter and not nice, didn't give us her name... Even the guy next to us said the service was bad.... I did not feel welcome here and will go back to Four Peaks as I do every time a new place tries too be like FOUR PEAKS, AGAIN! LOL oh btw tell the bar manager big arms and no legs,  he should pay attention..  his crew... Back massages on the job, how long do I wait for my beer before the massage is Over? On The job??? How long do I have to sit here watching my bartender get a back massage while I'm sitting here waiting for my beer? Come on?!??!?
