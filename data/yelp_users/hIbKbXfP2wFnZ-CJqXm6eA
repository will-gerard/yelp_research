Gotta say I'm a vet skeptic. This place has never failed to make me feel like I was not getting ripped off even a little bit. Very trust worthy.

Excellent food. Huge portions enough to share if you would like. If you order an dinner plate expect to have enough left over for a second meal. If you order the gyro eat your rice and pick at the meat (which is awesome) then take home what will still be a larger than needed gyro. Go here.

I have asked for a variety if sauces and plenty. I get 3/4 sauce per item. Makes me sad when I have to eat Taco Bell with my own sorry sauce.

It's a Burger King so the food is standard Burger King (good bk). But what's best is the service everyone is on board doing what they are supposed to be doing. Good leadership at this location.

Donuts are what they do 3rd best. They bake their own sandwich bread. Get anything with croissant.

They know what they are doing, but you can end up with 50.00 fade if your not careful. Which is good and bad, but 5 stars because of quality, razor shave and overall barber skill.
