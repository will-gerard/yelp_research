here's the deal. fate is costly. the drinks are costly. the food is costly. the atmosphere, quality,  and service are priceless.  i don't mind waiting forever for something that is worthwhile and fate is.  i have only been disappointed in one fate experience and it had more to do with being in a large party in a small restaurant.   tofu is amazing.

easily my favorite venue in phoenix. i love the atmosphere. i love the people who work there. i love so many of the bands that tour though here.  most of my favorite shows have taken place here. i have experienced community in it's truest form here. it was amazing.   my only issue with the modified is a big one. for some reason the sound kills me, but good bands sound good there...

mi patio is one of my favorite places to start a saturday night.   the combination of mexican and greek may seem scary at first.  when my best friend ordered a spinach and feta chimichanga i was a little frightened, but it was love at first bite.  the bartender is amazing on saturday nights.

dillards. we were once friends. a very good friend of mine was shopping here last week. she was carrying a top searching for the fitting room when the employee approached her and asked if she needed help. my friend said she wanted to try the top on, to which the employee said, 'i'm sorry, i hate to be honest with you honey, that's just not going to fit.'  my friend was obviously horrified and left the store immediately.   i was shocked to hear this. this is one of the most unfortunate things i have ever known anyone to experience.

i HATE the marquee. hate it.   when i'm looking at tours and see 'marquee' as the venue i am generally so discouraged.   i hate the parking. i hate the sound. i hate no re-entry.   the only things i like about the marquee are: 1. that there is not a segregated area for the people under 21.  2. luckyman, the promoter, is insanely good to their bands, which is comforting.

i'm a packaging person. the way things are packaged makes a huge difference in my experience. i love the cups at lux. simple and wonderful.   my best friend was in austin for three months and when he returned he informed of a coffee place there he would frequent, i was so excited to bring him to lux and give him back a little piece of home.

dear god what did i do to deserve some thing as wonderful as chino's?  once i got past the exterior i was so pleasantly rewarded with one of the most delicious meals i have ever eaten in my life. the mexican/chinese on the same plate is quality.

cibo are my big guns.   if i'm going to cheer someone up or celebrate something epic, this is where i'm taking them.  there is a decent wine list, all of the food is interesting and delicious, the atmosphere is lovely.   i love bringing people here for the first time. they are usually so excited to find a place so unique and delicious.

if you don't like bacon, i would skip matt's, but if you like bacon, you should go every day. there is no bacon like the bacon at matt's. i have a friend who rants about this at least once a week. i'm certain this is the only meat product this vegetarian misses.  i haven't really tried a lot of things on the menu. i'm a big fan of the specials and the 5 spot.

i have never stayed here but the rooftop bar at sunset is such a good idea.  my  only complaint is the lack of music... other than that it is so beautiful.

i'm not afraid to say it. i am a roosevelt regular. a member of the 'boat club.' when i walk in everyone knows my name and are as excited to see me as i am to see them.  the girls here know what they are doing. i told jenna that i was not a beer drinker and she kindly introduced me to several delicious options. my friends and i trust them so much that i generally just say, 'bring me whatever' and am never disappointed.   i'm a fan of most everything about the roosevelt. the music, the color of the walls, the wallpaper in the couch room, the at home feel, the friendly employees, the flowers that brighten each room, the secret bathroom, the snacks, when they have pap star as a red wine...  then you go to the inside bathroom. everything else is so chill and wonderful, that when i arrive at the bathroom with white walls, i am so disappointed. obviously minor, but it's the only thing i would change.

great service. great drinks. unique and delicious menu.  i've been here twice.  once with adventurous eaters who loved it. and once with boring eaters who were still pleased.  i highly recommend dining here!

i have only really ever had one good experience here.   if you are over 21 and plan on drinking, don't plan on watching the band that is playing. the bar is located in the middle of the room which makes watching the show insanely difficult.   the sound has potential to be good, but usually isn't.   however, a lot of my favorite bands have played awesome shows here, so i will continue to attend.

st. francis, you are the most frustrating place in phoenix to me. i am always so pleased with the food but horrified by the service.  that's right, horrified.  i have been here four times, in hopes this was some kind of sick fluke, but no, this is not the case.  however, the food is fantastic. the brunch is a wonderful spring day event. but be prepared to sit at your table without a drink for 15 minutes and to not place your order for another 30 minutes, even if you feel like it isn't busy, the service will not improve.

If I could give no stars, I would.   I made a reservation for my best friends birthday brunch for Sunday at 1130 for 8. When we arrived the hostess informed us to have a seat on the patio and she would let us know when the people ahead of us were done at the table. Fine. We were seated at 1150. With a reservation. Are you kidding me? Our server came by after about 5 minutes and took our drink order, she returned with said drinks, (7 of the same drink) after 20 minutes. 20 minutes after this she returned to take our food order. Then we ordered another round of $9 drinks, when the drinks arrived 15 minutes later, mine was forgotten, but was brought after another 15 minutes. A little more than an hour after we ordered our meals arrived, but not my crispy fingerling potatoes. (which is my favorite thing) When I asked for them, our server said they would be out in 2 minutes. When I was finished with my meal, they were brought out. We were here for 3 hours! 3 hours! No one asked us if we wanted more drinks and frankly, no one was friendly. I will NEVER come here again.

i love palatte.   since i first became addicted in the summer, it has been a weekly fixture in my life. since the weather has been inviting sitting outside with a group of fantastic people is so wonderful. everything i have eaten there has been delicious. the lattes and mimosas are outstanding. the baked goods are always something different and interesting and tasty.   spending a sunday morning here is my favorite thing in the world. sunday morning has quality musicians playing quality songs.  the wait for food on the weekend is always pretty crazy, but if you have a morning to spare. i highly recommend spending it here. get a muffin right away and sit down and enjoy some music and the fresh air. it will be worth it.

bunky provides something unique downtown that i desire.   there is a small selection, hence boutique, but it is all amazing. my first visit was at least an hour, going through each item of clothing, each with its own personality. the accessories are amazing.

oh phil's, you're my favorite place. after an evening of expensive, weak drinks and george and dragon my friends and i made our way over to phil's where we were welcomed by every single person there. we also had to order 4 drinks to meet the $10 card requirement. it was fabulous.

rise up is amazing for several reasons:  1. rise up is a non profit organization that does humanitarian work helping children get educated around the world. clearly awesome.  2. clothing line is good for everyone. i was able to buy a birthday present for my best friend, my brother, my mother, and my father all at one store.  3. decor of the shop. from the art, to the gurney, to the church pew. everything means something. the 'kill  your tv' installation is epic.   4. the record player. all the music in the store is on vinyl, so you can come in and choose a record to listen to while you shop. i chose radiohead. clearly a good call.

i started going to postino for their amazing monday and tuesday bottle and a board deal. i was pretty much in love with postino upon my first visit, and thus, malbec monday was born. how could you hate a monday when you know your day will end in a bottle of malbec and board of delicious bruschetta?  the staff are friendly, and knowledgeable, and really, honestly, hilarious.  as if this weren't good enough, then god blessed me with postino brunch. postino brunch is hands down, the BEST brunch in phoenix. the terrible void of an amazing brunch in phoenix that was left when pallette closed has finally been filled. a peach bellini and country toast: this is my ideal sunday afternoon. meals are served with an amazing tiny tomato salad, i don't even like tomatoes... it's so good.

fall in phoenix was made for the main ingredient.  who doesn't love an all day happy hour sunday/monday patio situation? a little hip hop, a lot of wine, an amazing mac and cheese. what a great day.

Bliss has a breakfast sandwich I a pretzel bun. I can not think of a name more fitting for such a wonderful experience. Amazing inexpensive cocktails (even the "skinny" drinks are heaven) Friendly service even when a million people are there. I love this place. Can't wait to go back!

with so many coffee options in phoenix i can say confidently that jobot is my favorite of these. an iced toddy from here makes a terrible day a great one, and if you're lucky enough to come up on an oatmeal cookie, just go home and go to bed, nothing in your day can get better than that...

service here is outstanding. again, outstanding.  spicy veggie tacos are interesting and satisfying.  i had the jalapeno margarita and found out i am a freaking wimp when it comes to spicy... the sangria however, is amazing and i love it. i think about it often.

FAVORITE FAVORITE FAVORITE   i love windsor.  i love that i can have a delightful #63 with gin and that everyone is mildly excited when i order it. i love the glass it comes in.  i love the mixed grain salad. i think about it when i eat other salads, i feel like i'm cheating on it.  i love every single thing about the artwork here. really, a chevron pattern with only the word, yes? yes please. we love having you here? thanks windsor, i loved being here. a neon print that says it all makes sense? it does windsor. thanks. oh and a freaking wall of cassette tapes!? oh my god. so freaking darling.   the floor between windsor and churn says, you should, such a wonderful encouragement to eat peanut butter ice cream after 3 glasses of wine. i love that every time i come here, it seems one of my favorite songs is playing, it feels like home and i love it.  i love the people that work here. i love the way everyone seems excited i'm there... again.  i held an open house here for my birthday. we were here for the entire day, well into the evening. everyone was so attentive and kind and i think most of the staff came to our table to wish me a happy birthday. this was when i fell in love with windsor and i have been at least once a week since.

Are you kidding me!? So wonderful. Such a great atmosphere. Incredible attention to detail. And as always, best staff ever.  When mention of a wine cooler was made to me, I was not as excited as I should have been... but grapefruit ginger, all my wildest drink dreams came true.  We ordered the FA & Veg Board and the Casanova Pizza, both were amazing, beyond my expectations. Best wood fired pizza in Phoenix, hands down. (I am actually shocked to see someone would even find Humble Pie comparable?) Great job, can not wait to come back.
