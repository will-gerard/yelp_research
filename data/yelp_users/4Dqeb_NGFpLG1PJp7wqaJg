If the thought of breakfast makes you all tingly in your nether regions, then you have to eat at this place.  You will definitely feel...satiated.  I chose the BC's B&G - jalapeno biscuits topped with eggs (I chose scrambled) topped with sausage gravy and served with a side of potatoes and fruit.  Definitely hearty and kept me full until happy hour (more on that later).  The gravy was a little watered down to my liking, but the jalapeno flavor in the biscuit was subtle, but it was there when you bit into it.  Be prepared for a wait on the weekends, but you will be glad you did.  If you have a mimosa itch to scratch (no booze served here - hence 4 stars only), then walk over to Saddle Ranch while you are waiting.

Dude...breakfast done right.  I ordered huevos rancheros and it came with a side of potatoes.  Delicious.  Very nice and spicy sauce that came with my huevos.  The ladies and I shared a short stack (2 cakes) of blueberry pancakes and smothered it in butter and syrup.  It was sweet and delicious and the cakes were nice and fluffy.  Also, three of the four ladies ordered a side of gravy to go with their biscuits they received with their meals (bread does not come with huevos rancheros).  I sampled a bit of a biscuit and it was really, really good.  Really crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle.  The diner is small and filled with old-school charm.  There are autographed photos from all kinds of old-school celebrities.  Our server was really sweet and did a nice job of handling all of her tables on a busy Saturday morning.

Casino only!  I can gamble here for hours and still walk away with money.  It doesn't matter if it is the tables (cheap minimums!!) or the slots.  This is the real Vegas with the real crowds that are in it to win it.  Cocktail waitresses are also frequent and attentive.  Fremont Street is the best!

Good God, this was a great breakfast experience!  Biscuits & Gravy, potatoes, bacon.  I even got a hot chocolate to boot.  I thoroughly enjoyed my food.  The prices are real cheap and the portions are real big, not to mention awesome greasy spoon fare.  My dining companions raved about the steak special and they say the meat is good too.  Plus a brewery that has good beer too!  You would never know that so much good stuff is in this place.  It pays to get off the strip!  Why the 4 stars instead of the whole she-bang!?  One - I could not swap the ham for bacon on the Biscuits & Gravy special plate.  Okay, fine.  I ordered the items I really wanted separately and the price cost the same as the special.  But hey, I wanted the swap.  Two - our waitress was not very attentive.  It was a busy morning, so I will not go too hard on her, but getting a glass of water and getting plates cleared was just not happening that morning.  Oh well.  I will be back, that is for damn sure.  Bring on the gravy!!!

This will go down as one of the best meals of my life.  The service, the ambiance, the decor, the drinks and the food were all impeccable.  Who knew there was such a gem disguised in old building with old signage in the middle of Phoenix?!!  You would expect this place to be in Hollywood.  The leddies and I started off with a round of up and dirty Grey Goose martinis from the main bartender who was working most of the bar on this busy Saturday night.  He seemed a little annoyed when I added two more martinis just after putting in an order for two, but I tipped him well and then he was all chatty.  Well played, buddy.  His drinks were awesome too...made perfectly!  We then we seated and ordered a bottle of house Pinot Noir, which was delicious.  We then got the bread, which has some amazing butter garlic sauce oozing all over the top of the loaf.  My house salad was tasty, but the star was my entree - scallops with a baked potato.  The odd thing was the waitress asked me how I wanted my scallops cooked, which has never happened before.  They are not steak...just cook them normal.  And the chef did and it was perfect.  We also got a side of asparagus, but no one touched the hollandaise sauce.  That is how good the asparagus tasted.  Our waitress was attentive and took great care of us.  Even the water girl made sure our waters were filled at all times.  Durant's - I cannot wait to come back and visit you!

Alright...bullet points on this one:  1.  Nice looking hotel at very nice prices 2.  Standard rooms comes with a TV from about 1992 and it is 13 inches or so?  That's okay...you should not be in your room watching TV.  You should be in there to nurse a hangover.  3.  Slow drain in the sinks in some of the rooms, but not in ours. 4.  $10 Pai Gow tables make me supremely happy 5.  Nice and efficient cocktail waitresses on the casino floor 6.  What???  Sam Adams is the darkest beer you have?  No Newcastle?  No Guinness? BAH! 7.  The buffet food for weddings (should you decide to have a wedding here or you are a guest at one) is A-MAY-ZING!  Seriously good, quality food and a whole table of desserts in addition to the cake. 8.  The Frank Caliendo Show advertisements on repeat in every elevator was god damn annoying.  I wanted to punch those little TV screens after a few trips. 9.  Don't ever order at a bar in the Casino, unless you are playing video poker - it cost us $16 for a bottle of Sam Adams and a Jack & Coke.  I am too cheap for that nonsense and I should've known better. 10.  Excellent location on The Strip!  All in all, this is now on my list of hotels I would stay at again and will keep in the rotation on where to stay in Vegas.

**CASINO ONLY**  You know...I have never stayed here.  But I sure have given this casino a tidy pile of money over the years.  Still, I enjoy coming here all the time.  The dealers are pretty swell and on this particular occasion, the cocktail waitress was coming back very frequently.  She was nice too.  Also, if you dudes want to treat yourself to something before you blow your wad of dough on gambling, get a shoe shine.  The rumor is that for $10 ($7 plus tip), you can get a million dollar shine.  BEST DEAL ON THE STRIP!

Okay...I've never had grits.  Luckie Maounds ordered a side of grits.  I sampled...about half the plate.  Now...I ate Cream of Wheat a lot when I was a kid and grits are about the same.  The big difference is that this place makes it the way my mom never would...with real butter, whole milk and cheese on top.  G'damn.  It wasn't just the grits that got me all hot and bothered.  Let me break it down:  *O.J. - fresh squeezed.  No fillers here; it is the real deal.  *Blue Plate Special - on this particular day, it was a scramble with bacon (that's all I needed to hear), mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions and covered in your choice of hollandaise sauce or swiss cheese (I chose the former of the two).  It is served up with a side of potatoes and toast.  Holy hearty!!!!  It was cooked well and so delicious.  Only gripe is serving butter on the side rather than buttering the toast right away; it never melted!!  *Grits - yeah, yeah...enough about that.  *The patio - it was a gorgeous morning and I am glad we chose to sit outside.  The pool was nearby and opening up as we were there.  The landscaping at this hotel is divine; nice flowers, chic 60s decor.  It is top notch.  *OUR WAITRESS!!! - her name escapes me, which sucks because she was a GREAT server.  Asked cool questions without being overbearing, offered to take our photo, made sure we had what we needed at all times.  She was fantastic!  Next time I am here, I will hit up this place again.  I absolutely loved this little oasis in the Scottsdale desert!

Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!    This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM!  On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.  For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time!   NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  They'll hit on your friends!

It's definitely not swanky, but it will satisfy with a little bit of everything on this menu.  Think Applebee's, but with good microbrews.  If you drink, then you must get the beer sampler.  You're not really coming for the food.  Remember that.  I hit this spot pretty regularly whenever I am in Vegas (because Downtown gambling and people-watching FAR outranks the Strip).  It has all the bad food you crave during the rat race of salads and Diet Cokes.  Even if there is a line out front, waiting to get in, just hang tight because it moves fast, no matter how large the group.  Very similar to a buffet cattle call.  Just eat, drink and be merry here!

You can put lipstick on a pig, but...you know the saying.  The Clarendon Hotel looks like it was recently purchased for a steal of a deal and someone came in, slapped on some paint real fast, did minimal work to make it look "hip" and invited a ton of college hipsters who cannot drink at bars to come and party in the rooms.  Truth be told, I really do not have a problem with that kind of place, but some people may show up here and wish they spent their money at a Marriott.  Let me break it down: + = the pool and pool area has been retiled and it is rad.  It is in the center of the hotel room blocks, so anyone can look down and see some hot, young bodies playing in the water.  That pool is the selling point.  +/- = the rooms are okay.  Make something look nice and people will like it, but dig deeper and some things are janky and the features are cheap.  The showerhead was messed up, but that was the only major problem.  The beds were nice and soft though.  + = nice bar/restaurant area.  We only drank there and did not eat anything.  - = my credit card was stolen from here.  Granted, I was in a drunken haze and forgot to pick it up after paying, but what really disappoints me is that the most creative places the thief went to was a gas station, a grocery store and a Wal-mart.  + = late night snacks available for free from 10:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m. (or something like that).  Doritos, Kit Kats, sodas.  Pure junk food.  Goes great with a six pack.  - = some tacky broads vandalized a car with white shoe polish.  I think the car belonged to the lady working the front desk overnight and these bitches didn't get their way, so they had to be dicks.  Tacky.  Based on this alone, I will never stay here again.  I can't support that.  So, family of 4 having a nice vacation in the desert?  Do not stay here.  This place is for 19 year olds who want to have a hotel party because they cannot drink anywhere else.

A cool dive bar with a cool atmosphere.  No pretentiousness here.  They make this cocktail with ice tea (not a Long Island) that hits you when you have had 2...or 3 of them.  Recommended any time!

Delish...but then again, who doesn't like gelato?  I had the amarena (cherry) and it was quite tasty.  Smooth and creamy, just like I like my men.  :)  Definitely recommended when you want something sweet to finish off the meal.  Or when you are sweating balls in that nice, desert heat when August rolls around.

I was recently in Vegas for a wedding and the groom's parents generously treated the wedding party and family members to a reception here.  The weather was PERFECT and we were up on the rooftop deck for the night.   The patio was nice with an ample amount of chairs and tables for sitting and mingling.  On the opposite side of the bar is a stage where bands can play.  I stuck with beer for the whole weekend and here, they served Negro Modelo in the bottle (along with other beers, of course).   I only had a wedge of the Mexican pizza appetizer and it was damn good.  I highly recommend ordering that.  The servers were great.  Very friendly and attentive (and attractive, but duh...it is Vegas).  Based on the ambiance and service, this place is awesome and I would come back here again.

The experience was a good one.  It was a busy afternoon at Rubio's and we had a BIG order for 5 girls who were getting ready for a wedding. I stood in a line of about 4 people ahead of me and then, when it was my turn, I made a $32 order.  One burrito order was pretty much deconstructed (down to the whole wheat tortilla substitution) and then reconstructed.  But they got it all done in a sufficient amount of time and they did it all with a smile.  No attitude whatsoever.    Everyone enjoyed the food and the salsas.  OH...a worker came out to spiff up the salsa bar while we were waiting too.  I love that with even a busy crowd, workers can work in some side cleaning.  That says a lot about the staff.    Definitely hit up this place.  Better than greasy Chinese food or even greasy McDonald's.

I did not want to leave, but after about 5 plus hours of hanging out, it was time.  This spa was top notch and pristine.  The property (the Hyatt) is already amazing to begin with; lots of great pools, the golf course, cabanas with roof decks for guests.  I would stay here as a guest, for sure.  Back to the spa review...  The decor is fresh and modern.  The lockers have nice number locks.  The waters are refreshing.  The showers have the special wall spouts to wash you down from all angles.    My favorite area was the mineral pool.  When you walk out, you will enter an area that is covered and can be used for hanging out, ordering and eating food, etc.  There are also fireplaces there, which is nice.  Then you walk down the steps to the pool, which had a nice temperature and was fun to play and swim in.  There are lounge chairs and towels galore.  It was very relaxing and peaceful.  I had the 60 minute mineral massage, which is a part-Thai massage, so there was lots of stretches involved.  I was in heaven and it was hands down one of the best massages I have ever received.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I look forward to coming back to this place.  The prices for the massage are comparable to other high-end spas, but this one is most definitely a cut above the rest.

This place is pretty swanky and has awesome deals if you time it right.  I suppose since it is not the new, hot joint anymore, it helps keep the prices down.  Oh!   I turned $80 into $300 in the early morning playing penny slots.  Cha-CHING!  The sofas and bed in the suites are pretty amazing.  Very comfy.  The TV is a bit off - the volume will automatically adjusted to blaring volumes each time you turn it on.  The pool seems a little small for the size of the hotel, but it is very pretty.  Cute little shops and coffee stands (Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf) are in the lobby.  I think I have a new home in Vegas!

It was late and we had barely eaten all day.  After buying the giant , FOOTBALL of booze, we decided that we wanted a proper greasy spoon breakfast.  We ended up in line at this establishment.  The wait took a while.  It turns out that there was no host/hostess, so a waitress was doing double duty.  She was hustling too.  When we got seated, we had to wait a bit for some service.  As it turns out, the whole seating chart and which waiter was taking which tables was a total clusterf*ck.  The hostess/waitress ended up taking our order eventually.  We each ordered the same thing: scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast.  All the food turned out as expected minus the bacon.  It was dropped in a deep fat fryer and incenerated to the point where it was chalk-like.  Not edible at all.  But the rest of the meal was decent.  The bussers were slow and dimwits.  If someone tells you to bring 2 glasses of water of to our table, don't worry about putting them on a tray and gingerly walking them over.  Use your hands, pal!  Plus, they often started cleaning tables, but never seemed to finish.  This added to the whole "line to be seated" chaos.  Bah...look, if you are starving, eat here.  But there are several other places on Fremont Street that can feed you...better.

Swanky food in DOWNTOWN??!!!  Yes, yes, YEEEESSS!!  When Maounds suggested this place for dinner, I was skeptical at first.  A nice restaurant in The Plaza?  Are you sure?  But I trust her (and her palate) so I went with it.  Man, oh, MAN, I am glad I did!  The decor is super sexy.  A giant wall of window looks out onto Fremont Street, so if you hit it at the right time, you can see the light show.  The lighting in the restaurant is dark and sultry.  It was very modern with clean lines and dark wood too.  You would swear you are not Downtown at all.  The food was incredible.  Everything is tapas style so you can have a bite of everything (or hog a couple of plates just for yourself, like I did).  I had the tomato basil soup with grilled cheese (BRIE!) and the ham and cheese croquettes.  The soup was delicious, as was the grilled cheese (though the bread was a little too soft and flakey for my taste) and the ham and cheese croquettes were incredible (but share these because they are rich and you don't want to over-do it).  I only drank beer since I did not want to mix my liquor for the night.  My boyfriend had the thai beef salad and he really, really liked it.  Generally he like potatoes with his meat, so I was surprised it got such rave reviews.  He also raved about the sliders with the bleu cheese (and he is no bleu cheese fan at all).  Maounds had the bacon wrapped dates and something else, all of which she loved.  She also had a carmel apple martini and she is not one to normally drink the frou frou cocktails.  You know how to make people want to come out of their comfort zone, Firefly.  That is a sign of a great restaurant!  Next time I am Vegas, I will definitely be back here!  I cannot WAIT!

I am not a fan of wings (too many bones and it just LOOKS messy) nor am I a fan of $9.99 prime rib.  But my man was really, really excited about both AND this place is open 24 hours.  When you are coming in from an outing of gambling and drinking, you are going to want to eat.  We were staying at this hotel, so this was convenient.  I think we got in about 1:30 a.m. and there was a hell of wait.  But it turns out that the hostess was slammed with taking room service calls, ringing up bills, AND the occasional bussing of tables, so she was busting some serious ass in order to keep up.  I do not blame her for the wait at all.  When she did get to the parties that were waiting, we got seated right away.  The waitress took some time to get to us.  Granted, she was busy too.  I ordered a Newcastle to drink and she had to go out to the casino bar to get it, if that says anything.  He ordered the plain wings (from midnight to 6:00 a.m., wings are $0.25 each, but you must order a minimum of 10) and the $9.99 prime rib.  I ordered the club sandwich.  My sandwich was tasty and done well.  The bacon was cooked through, the fries were seasoned a little.  I have no complaints, except that you could tell that the turkey was from the packet of cheapest cold cuts you can buy.  But the prime rib and the wings was not a hit with my man.  He hated them both.  He said the wings were greasy and tasteless and the meat was horrible.  Fatty, bad tasting...and this was all after a night of drinking when the taste buds are destroyed.  I noticed that the meat was turning grey too.  Blech.  It took forever to get the bill when we were done with dinner.    All in all, play it safe here and get some traditional greasy spoon fare.  You should be fine.  Don't fall for the specials.  And while service was slow, I blame that on the management for not staffing enough people to work.  All those who were working busted some serious tail.
