This coffee house ROCKS! The staff is incredibly kind, the fresh baked goods are fantastic, and the coffee... Well it's incredible.  They use a french press to prepare coffee and it makes for an incredible brew!  The atmosphere is great with awesome music!!!!  In general, this place is a definite two thumbs up! You won't be disappointed!

I had the opportunity to visit Big Two this past weekend. I was in the market to purchase a 2016 4Runner Limited. This dealership was the only one in the valley who had the exact model and color scheme I had wanted for months. A friend of mine referred me to Jeff Capshaw. This guy was awesome. Originally, I was dealing with a John (at least that's what I think his name was) in the fleet department who was less than ideal to work with and lost his temper early in negotiation so I walked out on the deal. Jeff was made aware of the incident and quickly contacted me apologizing for this person's behavior. He was genuinely interested in me and wanted to personally help me. The next morning I was on my way to another dealership and Jeff and I started communicating again. I diverted my car and returned. When I arrived, Jeff was in shorts and a t-shirt.  THE GUY CAME IN ON HIS DAY OFF TO HELP ME!!!!!  How many other people would do this???  When I arrived, he had a couple offers to present and the deal was closed in a matter of minutes!  I must say this guy impressed the heck out of me!  He's won me as a customer forever and I will sing his praise to anyone who is looking for a Toyota. Big Two, you have a true gem for a Fleet Manager in Jeff Capshaw!  Thanks Jeff for your professionalism and your genuine courtesy!  Two thumbs up...  WAY UP!!!

Ok.  This is one of those restaurants that is off of the beaten path but is soooo totally worth it!  It is in a strip mall at Baseline and 24th St in the Fry's shopping center.  When you walk in, the restaurant has a very comfortable feel.  Reviewing the menu, the entire menu reveals food that is incredibly heathy not to mention tasty.  This family owned restaurant makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk it.  I don't know about the majority of people around town, but I, for one, love to support local business in lieu of corporate chains.  What can I tell you, beside being very comfortable and friendly, the food is INCREDIBLE!!!  I had the Thai Shrimp salad which was an incredible experience of flavor.  Would I return here to eat again???  You bet I would!  In a heart beat!  Thank you for an incredible first experience!  :)

Several friends and I took a friend to Fez for his birthday. The service was very poor often waiting a half hour for a server to come around to check if we needed anything. When she did come around, she would ask part of our group personally is they needed anything, the rest of us had to call her back so we could order.  When our dinners arrived, 4 out of 5 of our order were incorrect. They took our food back to the kitchen to talk to the chef. They returned with our same plates after several minutes stating that their menu had changed since moving from their old location.  We pointed out that their printed menu didn't match the food that was brought to us. By this time our food was completely cold.   We kept the food, howbeit cold by this time, to avoid further problems. They, then, completely avoided our table until they brought the check before asking if there was anything else that we needed. Poor form in general!  To their credit, however, they did credit 50% of each of our food tickets and, in my case, did credit the glass of wine I had.   It was just an unfortunate experience. If they were a new restaurant, one could forgive such service and chalk it up to learning and growing pains. This is not a new restaurant, however, and the food and service was much better at their former location.  It's unlikely I'll return.
